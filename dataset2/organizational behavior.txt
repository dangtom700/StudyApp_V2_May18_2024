succeed in the workplace.

The World’s Most Successful Organizational Behavior 
Text Is Better Than Ever
This new 19th edition of Organizational Behavior continues to distinguish itself by solving today’s most pressing 
teaching and learning challenges in the field of organizational behavior. OB instructors often face a major chal￾lenge in keeping up with advancement and innovation in our understanding of people at work. Moreover, stu￾dents’ learning, engagement with, and understanding of OB are framed by the present. Many students wonder 
about the implications of transformative current events on the world of work.
For instance, the COVID-19 crisis has brought questions to light about whether telecommuting is effective, how 
work and life interactions can be managed, and the effect of the pandemic’s stressors on employee mental and 
physical well-being. The pandemic has also renewed interest in the burgeoning gig economy and the many ethical 
and practical issues that follow. Also, the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements have sparked considerations 
of how organizations, leaders, and employees can fight for equality and equity, promote and value diversity, and 
foster inclusive practices in the workplace. Finally, advancements in technology (e.g., artificial intelligence, ma￾chine learning, social media) have revolutionized the way organizations do business. Therefore, the way employees 
interact with customers, coworkers, and leaders has been changed as well.
In this edition of Organizational Behavior, we build upon the basic core of OB knowledge to highlight timely ad￾vancements in these topics. Over half of the examples and references have been updated since the previous edition. 
We have completely revisited, revised, and refreshed the chapters on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Communica￾tion, Culture and Change, and Stress and Health to meet these current learning and teaching challenges. Apart 
from updating half of the in-text features and end-of-text exercises, this edition contains a new feature (Toward a 
Better World) that highlights social responsibility, justice, and ethics issues facing organizations today. Moreover, we 
augment the improved topic coverage with supplements designed to enhance the teaching and learning experience.
Lastly, Organizational Behavior focuses on translating state-of-the-art theory and research on OB into actionable 
practices that students can directly apply in the world of work. By focusing on why OB matters in the workplace, 
students can apply what they learn to their own working experiences, regardless of their field of study. We offer a 
complete, high-tech support package for both faculty and students. For more information about any of our supple￾mental resources, please visit the Pearson Higher Education website.

Develop Self-Awareness and an Awareness of Others
The authors have recommended Personal Inventory Assessments for each chapter, which are assignable in the 
MyLab. These assessments help develop professionalism and awareness of oneself and others, skills necessary for 
future career success.
Additional Application Practice in End-of-Chapter Material
Experiential Activities, Ethical Dilemmas, and Cases are included at the end of each chapter. Also, five Compre￾hensive Cases at the end of the textbook provide more practice than any other text available.
ETHICAL DILEMMA Credit Where Credit Is Due
You are preparing for the weekly team meeting, during
which each team member shares a new idea that they
have been working on that week. One idea in particular
receives very positive feedback. The idea sticks with you as
incredibly innovative, and you remark to your coworker,
Aiden, “Wasn’t that a great idea that Alex shared?”
she would completely take the idea as her own. But Alex
and I work together frequently. I do not want to create
an uncomfortable situation.” Finally, after a long pause,
Aiden says more confidently, “I’m not going to say any￾thing. I think I was overacting.”
CASE INCIDENT Work–Life Balance at R.G. & Company
Tatum is a consultant at R.G. & Company (R.G.), a global 
consulting firm. She has enjoyed the past few years work￾ing at the company. As an ambitious person, she has been
focusing on her long-term goal of advancing within the 
company. Furthermore, Tatum has always been passionate 
about her work and could not imagine working anywhere
else. Nonetheless, working at R.G. as a mother of a young
child has not been without its challenges. The company
does offer some flexibility in terms of when she is in the 
office. As long as she completes her work, her supervisors 
usually do not care if she leaves early or works from home 
when her daughter is sick.
If Tatum wants a promotion, she believes she needs to 
make herself stand out among all the company’s qualified 
individuals.
R.G. has policies to accommodate those with family re￾sponsibilities. But, in practice, Tatum knows that few em￾ployees take advantage of them. For example, Tatum was 
a little surprised at how quickly her supervisor, Kennedy,
returned to the office after having a child. However, 
Kennedy was much admired at R.G. and was held up as an
example that it was possible to have it all—to be a success￾ful working mother. The alternative was for Tatum to tran￾sition to working part-time or switch to a less demanding
role. Unfortunately, these alternatives would essentially
mean putting aside her goal of advancement.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Managing Remote Teams
Guava is a music streaming service located in Silicon 
Valley that is steadily growing (with roughly 500 employ￾ees currently). Guava has plans to hire many new employ￾ees within the coming year. The CEO, Lennox Reynolds, 
has a vision to permanently transition roughly half of
the existing employees to remote work and potentially 
hire additional remote workers. Reynolds also wants the 
company to develop a flatter structure. Rather than have 
departments organized by traditional functions like engi￾neering or marketing, employees would work on project
teams and have greater autonomy. Reynolds believes this
will allow creativity and innovation to thrive (helping 
Guava develop a competitive advantage). Reynolds thinks
a rigid traditional structure restricts employees and stifles
creativity and innovation. Rather than having a single
designated leader, teams will allow individuals to emerge 
as leaders.
development for newer employees, and developing a new 
structure for making important decisions. Furthermore, 
all employees were surveyed to assess whether they would 
choose to work remotely full-time or part-time if given
the option. Thirty percent of existing employees said
they were very interested in working remotely full-time. 
While some employees have expressed strong preferences 
for working remotely, other employees and many supervi￾sors have various concerns. Guava needs to decide soon
regarding its remote work policy. The decision will impact
whether the company chooses to scale back office space 
and require significant structural changes.

Toward a Better World
Ben & Jerry’s: The Scoop on What It Takes to
Be a CSR-Oriented Company
Ben & Jerry’s, an ice cream maker 
headquartered in Vermont, is often 
touted as the poster child for corpo￾rate social responsibility (CSR). From 
humble beginnings, Ben & Jerry’s has 
a storied history of making unique, 
chunky ice cream flavors, churning out 
immense profits on just about a yearly 
basis, and eventually being acquired 
by a major corporation. But despite all 
these changes throughout the com￾pany’s history, their commitment to a 
a better place. In 2019, for instance, 
they eliminated 245,000 pounds of 
plastic packaging, straws, and spoons.
However, Ben & Jerry’s has not gone 
without critique. The pretty picture of 
what it takes to be a CSR-oriented com￾pany often focuses on the successes, 
but rarely do we see the failures. For 
instance, in the 1990s, one researcher 
uncovered actions with good intentions 
gone wrong. As some examples, many
have taken issue with the price of the 
by OB scientists. For instance, one 
study focused on CEO letters and 
interviews with long-tenured employ￾ees and newcomers to Ben & Jerry’s 
over a 30-year span. It found that, fol￾lowing the acquisition, employees had 
to “whipsaw” back and forth between 
the triple bottom line and the finan￾cial performance desired by the post￾acquisition CEOs. Further, another 
research study found that the acquir￾ing organization (Unilever) may have

Myth or Science?
Work Has to Be Purposeful to Be Motivating
Describing the impact employ￾ees’ work has on the world has 
become a familiar strategy that 
organizations use to inspire employ￾ees. For example, Amazon tells employ￾ees they are building the future, and 
Microsoft describes how employees 
empower individuals and organizations 
around the world to achieve more. The 
belief is that if workers view their job 
as purposeful, organizations can avert 
demotivation. 
However, only a small percentage
of employees worldwide, regardless of
could have unintended consequences.
Although workplaces from IKEA to 
Microsoft promise meaningful work with
a greater purpose, employees’ tasks
may be routine and disconnected from 
the inspirational purpose organizations 
are promising. One survey of seven
hundred employees across twenty-two 
industries demonstrates this discon￾nect. In this study, all but one employee 
were able to very quickly identify a triv￾ial or meaningless task that they were
required to do regularly for their job.
In other words, most employees seem
of impact than their actual impact. The
result is lower levels of meaning, enjoy￾ment, and motivation. 
However, just because some jobs
require employees to do more of these
routine tasks does not mean these
employees have to be any less motivated
or engaged. One promising intervention
is “superordinate framing.” Employees 
can use this framing tool to think about
how seemingly unimportant tasks work
to achieve a greater purpose. If organi￾zations invest in helping employees nd 
meaning and purpose in even the most
Myth or Science? engages students 
with popular opinions, conclusions, or 
conjectures from the working world, 
carefully considering whether these 
conclusions are supported or refuted 
based on empirical evidence.

Business Books: Facts? Or Just Fads?
POINT
C
onduct a quick search on Amazon and you will find a wide se￾lection of management books whose titles tell us the topics we
apparently need to know about:
● Drive to Thrive (Bajaj, 2020)
● The Savage Leader: 13 Principles to Become a 
Better Leader from the Inside Out (Reinke, 2021)
● The First-Time Manager (McCormick, 2018)

(Cuomo 2020)
COUNTERPOINT
P
eople want to know about management—the good, the bad, 
and the ugly. People who have experience or high interest write
about the topics that interest readers, and publishers put out 
the best of these texts. When books become popular, we know people 
are learning from them and finding good results by applying the au￾thor’s management ideas. Texts like these can provide people with the 
secrets to management that others have worked out through experi￾ence. Isn’t it better to learn about management from people in the 
trenches instead of academia’s latest obscure references? Many of
the most important insights we gain in life are not necessarily the 
product of careful empirical research studies.
The Point/Counterpoint at the end of each 
chapter presents opposing positions on hot top￾ics in Organizational Behavior to help students 
learn to think critically.
(Page 70)
An Ethical Choice confronts students 
with common ethical dilemmas in the 
working world related to OB topics and 
how these dilemmas can be approached 
with fairness, justice, and respect for 
others.
An Ethical Choice
What Should You Do If Your Values Do Not Align 
with Your Company’s?
So, you find yourself at work 
listening to your coworkers
expressing values and beliefs
radically different from your own.
You decide not to say anything and 
sometimes even pretend you agree 
with their opinions. Although you are 
suppressing your thoughts, you have
learned that it is best to leave your
personal views outside the office. You 
“facades of conformity” when faced 
with job insecurity.
Furthermore, research signals that 
inauthenticity in the workplace can 
lead individuals to engage in more
unethical behavior than when indi￾viduals have greater identity integra￾tion. Value incongruence is positively

THE RISE AND FALL OF WEWORK’S CEO
Adam Neumann and his vision for reinventing work appeared to flourish 
overnight with the success of his company, WeWork. Although shared 
offices existed long before the rise of WeWork, early coworking spaces 
were not the most desirable. In contrast, what WeWork had to offer was a 
holistic approach that could provide services anywhere—from one person 
to one hundred people. The company took coworking to the next level by 
offering many of the services that can make starting a business tough, 
including IT, financial, and legal services. However, WeWork’s expansion did 
not come without a cost, especially when the company opened on average 
two locations each day at its peak.
Although Neumann has his fair share of critics, his vision was likely 
responsible for at least part of WeWork’s impressive growth. He is known for 
his charisma, willingness to take bold risks, and entrepreneurial vision. On 
the other hand, his somewhat unorthodox leadership style is probably also 
to blame for some of the problems WeWork encountered. Individuals within 
the company have noted that he could make impulsive decisions at times, 
which contributed to a sense of ambiguity within WeWork.
Many also describe the organizational culture during Neumann’s tenure 
as problematic. The “work hard, party hard” mentality appeared to be 
pervasive. After all, WeWork was one of the first coworking places to offer 
free beer to its clients. Furthermore, the company’s frequent parties made it 
an uncomfortable work environment for some employees. The company has 
also faced allegations of racial discrimination and sexual assault, with some 
blaming its partying culture for exacerbating these significant ethical lapses.
WeWork’s growth appeared to be almost unstoppable. It was on the 
verge of filing a highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) but rather 
abruptly made the unexpected move to postpone this decision in 2019. At 
the time, the company’s losses were close to $2 billion. Potential investors 
also appeared to be aware and concerned, not only with the company’s 
questionable business model but also with its leadership structure. Not 
long after, Neumann (WeWork’s cofounder and CEO of nine years) stepped 
down after facing pressure from SoftBank, a Japanese company that 
invested a significant amount of money in WeWork. The following year, the 
other cofounder (Miguel McKelvey) left the company as SoftBank began 
implementing a five-year turnaround plan for WeWork.
The challenges that faced WeWork during Neumann’s tenure highlight that 
the factors contributing to organizational crises do not only affect specific 
people, like an organization’s leadership. Instead, they also concern groups, 
teams, and the organizations themselves. In this case, Neumann’s motivations 
and decisions likely had a negative impact. Still, the group dynamics and 
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 37 13/12/22 1:55 AM38 PART 1 Introduction
organizational culture also appeared to play a role in problems at WeWork. The 
case of WeWork provides an excellent example of the behavioral complexity 
within organizations that contributes to their survival and success. The effect 
of behavior in organizations extends beyond individual people, affecting 
groups, teams, departments, and entire organizations.1
The details of WeWork’s CEO’s rise and fall reflect the increasing complexity 
and depth of organizational life. The effects of behavior ring through 
organizations—felt by workers, managers, groups, teams, and sometimes the 
whole organization. They also highlight several issues of interest to those seeking 
to understand organizational behavior, including motivation, justice, ethics, 
structure, culture, personality, and their organizationally relevant outcomes, 
such as turnover, productivity, and survival. Throughout this text, you will learn 
how organizational challenges often cut across areas like these, which is why the 
systematic approach pursued in this text and your course is essential.
Management and Organizational Behavior
1-1 Define organizational 
behavior (OB).
Right now, you might be wondering, “What is organizational behavior, and why 
does it matter to me?” We will define organizational behavior (OB) shortly, but 
first, let’s begin with the end in mind: why OB matters and what the study of OB 
offers you.
Historically, business school coursework emphasized the technical aspects 
of management, focusing on economics, accounting, finance, and quantitative 
techniques. Coursework on human behavior in organizations received relatively 
less attention. This might be surprising to you because you might be thinking 
“the people make the place”:2
 organizations are only as effective as the people 
who comprise them, so shouldn’t we try to understand people in the workplace 
as well as how we make decisions, communicate, and interact with one another? 
Over the past several decades, however, business schools have realized the signif￾icant role that interpersonal skills play in determining managers’ and employ￾ees’ effectiveness. This realization led to the birth of OB, which, at its core, 
focuses on individuals and groups in organizations.
Understanding OB is important to you now more than ever. We are in the 
midst of an OB revolution of sorts that is gaining traction year by year. As noted 
in the 2016 Deloitte Global business trends report, organizations have figured 
out that they need to understand “what makes people join, perform well in, 
and stay with an organization; who will likely be successful; who will make the 
best leaders; and what is required to deliver the highest-quality customer service 
and innovation.”3
 A knowledge of OB and interpersonal skills is critical for your 
success and advancement in the modern workplace. According to Jeff Weiner, 
executive chair of LinkedIn, “Communications is the No. 1 skills gap across... 
major cities in the United States.”4
 It is also relevant to nearly every job: one 
study by Monster mined about a million market-wide job postings to determine 
the most frequently desired skills in applicants.5
 Communication skills were 
at the top of the list, followed by other OB-relevant skills, including problem￾solving and influence skills.
Furthermore, these skills are also necessary for your career advancement. A 
survey of over 2,100 CFOs across 20 industries indicated that a lack of interper￾sonal skills is the top reason why some employees fail to advance.6
 Ultimately, OB 
can equip you with critical tools for success and advancement in the workplace. 
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 38 13/12/22 1:55 AMWhat Is Organizational Behavior? CHAPTER 1 39
In this text, we pay special attention to how the knowledge and practice of OB 
can help you (1) think analytically and critically, (2) make better decisions, (3) 
communicate and collaborate more effectively with others, and (4) act with a 
sense of social responsibility in the workplace. Research has demonstrated that 
these types of “employability skills” are highly valued and desired by employers. 
A lack of these skills can lead to problems in the workplace.7
Incorporating OB principles into the workplace can also yield many criti￾cal organizational outcomes. For one, companies known as good places to 
work—such as Hilton, UKG, Wegmans, Cisco, Workday, Salesforce, and 
Edward Jones8
—have been found to generate superior financial performance 
due to their attention to OB.9
 Second, developing managers’ and employees’ 
interpersonal skills helps organizations attract and keep high-performing 
employees. This function is vital because outstanding employees are always in 
short supply and costly to replace.10 Third, strong associations exist between 
the quality of workplace relationships and employee job satisfaction, stress, 
and turnover. One extensive study of hundreds of workplaces and more than 
200,000 respondents showed that social relationships among coworkers and 
supervisors were strongly related to overall job satisfaction. Positive social rela￾tionships were also associated with lower stress at work and lower intentions 
to quit.11 Additional research suggests that positive work relationships help 
employees to flourish—leading to improvements in job and life satisfaction, 
positive emotions at work, perceptions that one’s work has meaning, and even 
performance.12 Fourth, an emphasis on OB can foster awareness for organiza￾tions’ environmental, social, and sustainability performance.13 Accordingly, 
universities have begun to incorporate social entrepreneurship education into 
their curriculum to train future leaders in addressing social issues within their 
organizations.13 But enough of the positives—incorporating OB principles into 
the workplace can also help us understand how to manage the negative aspects 
and outcomes of work, such as unethical or deviant workplace behavior, vio￾lence, stress, discrimination, sexual harassment, conflict, drug abuse, incivility, 
and theft.15 Clearly, there are tremendous benefits to understanding people 
and their behavior within organizations. As such, this text has been written to 
help managers, potential managers, and employees develop an understanding 
of human behavior as individuals, members of groups or teams, and workers.
Who’s Who in the World of Work
Let’s begin by briefly defining the terms worker, manager, and organization.
First, workers are people within organizations who get things done. Workers, 
as individuals, members of work groups, teams, or organizations, contribute 
to the accomplishment of goals. It may seem unnecessary to define a worker 
up front, but as the past decade has demonstrated, the nature of work and 
what it means to be a worker is changing. For instance, today’s world of 
work is much more autonomous and interdependent. It requires a greater 
variety of skills than work 30 years ago.16 As we will discuss later in this chap￾ter, the turn of the millennium has led to a new era many refer to as the 
gig economy.17 Outside a full-time employee’s traditional role, nonstandard 
worker arrangements are much more common in today’s day and age, with 
many people working as contract workers, independent contractors, freelancers,
or temporary workers. Second, the most notable characteristic of managers
is that they get things done through other people. They make decisions, 
allocate resources, and direct others’ activities to attain goals. Managers are 
sometimes called administrators, especially in nonprofit organizations. They 
do their work in an organization, a consciously coordinated social unit com￾posed of two or more people, that functions on a relatively continuous basis 
worker An individual who contributes to 
the accomplishment of work goals.
manager An individual who achieves goals 
through other people.
organization A consciously coordinated 
social unit, composed of two or more people, 
that functions on a relatively continuous basis 
to achieve a common goal or set of goals.
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 39 13/12/22 1:55 AM40 PART 1 Introduction
to achieve a common goal or set of goals. By this definition, manufacturing 
and service firms are organizations, and so are schools; hospitals; churches; 
military units; nonprofits; police departments; and local, state, and federal 
government agencies.
More than ever, new hires and other employees are placed into man￾agement positions without sufficient management training or informed 
experience.18 According to a large-scale survey, more than 58  percent of 
managers reported that they had not received any training, and 25 percent 
admitted that they were not ready to lead others when they were given the 
role.19 In addition to the lack of training and preparation, job demands have 
increased: The average manager has seven direct reports (having five was 
once the norm) and spends less time supervising them than managers of the 
past.20 Considering that a Gallup poll found organizations chose the wrong 
candidate for management positions 82 percent of the time,21 we conclude 
that the more you can learn about people and how to manage them, the bet￾ter prepared you will be to be the right management candidate. OB will help 
you get there.
Management Activities
The world of work involves an overwhelming number of activities, tasks, and 
responsibilities. For instance, workers can collect, process, and make sense of 
data; make decisions; perform physical activities; interact with others; or per￾form administrative activities.22 Although workers’ activities may also involve 
interacting and coordinating work with other people, it is usually a much more 
significant component of managerial jobs. Managers’ work can be categorized 
into four different activities: planning, organizing, leading, and controlling. The 
planning function encompasses defining an organization’s goals, establishing an 
overall strategy for achieving those goals, and developing a comprehensive set 
of plans to integrate and coordinate activities. Evidence indicates the need for 
planning increases the most as managers move from lower-level to mid-level 
management.23
When managers design their work unit’s structure, they are organizing. The 
organizing function includes determining what tasks are to be done, who is to 
do them, how the tasks are to be grouped, who reports to whom, and where 
decisions are to be made.
Every organization contains people, and it is management’s job to direct and 
coordinate those people, which is the leading function. When managers moti￾vate employees, direct their activities, select the most effective communication 
channels, or resolve conflicts, they are engaging in leading.
Management must monitor its organization’s performance and compare it 
with previously set goals to ensure that activities are going as they should. If 
there are any significant deviations, management’s job is to get the organiza￾tion back on track. This monitoring, comparing, and potential correcting is the 
controlling function.
Management Roles
Henry Mintzberg, now a prominent management scholar, undertook a careful 
study of executives early in his career to determine what they did on their jobs. 
Based on his observations, Mintzberg concluded that managers perform ten 
different, highly interrelated roles or sets of behaviors, thus serving a critical 
function in organizations.24 As shown in Exhibit 1-1, these ten roles are primar￾ily (1) interpersonal, (2) informational, or (3) decisional. Although much has 
changed in the world of work since Mintzberg developed this model, research 
indicates the roles have changed very little.25
planning A process that includes defining 
goals, establishing strategy, and developing 
plans to coordinate activities.
organizing Determining what tasks are to 
be done, who is to do them, how the tasks 
are to be grouped, who reports to whom, and 
where decisions are to be made.
leading A function that includes motivating 
employees, directing others, selecting the 
most effective communication channels, and 
resolving conflicts.
controlling Monitoring activities to ensure 
that they are being accomplished as planned 
and correcting any significant deviations.

Exhibit 1-1 Minztberg’s Managerial Roles
Role Description
Interpersonal
Figurehead Symbolic head; required to perform a number of routine duties
of a legal or social nature
Leader Responsible for the motivation and direction of employees
Liaison Maintains a network of outside contacts who provide favors
and information
Informational
Monitor Receives a wide variety of information; serves as nerve center
of internal and external information of the organization
Disseminator Transmits information received from outsiders or from other
employees to members of the organization
Spokesperson Transmits information to outsiders on organization’s plans,
policies, actions, and results; serves as expert on organization’s
industry
Decisional
Entrepreneur Searches organization and its environment for opportunities
and initiates projects to bring about change
Disturbance handler Responsible for corrective action when organization faces
important, unexpected disturbances
Resource allocator Makes or approves significant organizational decisions
Negotiator Responsible for representing the organization at major
negotiations
Interpersonal Roles All managers must perform duties that are ceremonial and 
symbolic in nature. For instance, when the president of a college hands out 
diplomas at commencement or a factory supervisor gives a group of high school 
students a tour of the plant, they are acting in a figurehead role. Another key 
interpersonal role all managers have is a leadership role. This role includes hir￾ing, training, motivating, and disciplining employees. The third role within the 
interpersonal grouping is the liaison role, or contacting and fostering relation￾ships with others who provide valuable information. The sales manager who 
obtains information from the quality-control manager in their own company 
has an internal liaison relationship. When that sales manager has contact with 
other sales executives through a marketing trade association, they have external 
liaison relationships.
Informational Roles To some degree, all managers collect information from 
outside organizations and institutions. They typically scan the news media and 
talk with other people to learn of changes in the public’s tastes and what com￾petitors may be planning. Mintzberg called this the monitor role. Managers also 
act as a conduit to transmit information to organizational members. This is the 
disseminator role. Also, managers perform a spokesperson role when representing 
the organization to outsiders.
Decisional Roles Mintzberg identified four roles that require making 
choices. In the entrepreneur role, managers initiate and oversee new proj￾ects to improve their organization’s performance. As disturbance handlers, 
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 41 13/12/22 1:55 AM42 PART 1 Introduction
managers take corrective action in response to unforeseen problems. As 
resource allocators, managers are responsible for allocating human, physical, 
and monetary resources. Finally, managers perform a negotiator role. In this 
role, they discuss issues and bargain with other units (internal or external) 
to gain advantages for their unit.
Management Skills
Another way to consider what managers do is to look at the skills or competen￾cies they need to achieve their goals. Researchers have identified several skills 
that differentiate effective from ineffective workers and managers.26 These 
skills are essential, and all are necessary to become a well-rounded and effec￾tive manager.
Technical Skills Technical skills encompass the ability to apply specialized 
knowledge or expertise. When you think of the skills of professionals such 
as civil engineers or oral surgeons, you typically focus on the technical skills 
they have learned through extensive formal education. Of course, profes￾sionals do not have a monopoly on technical skills. Not all technical skills 
have to be learned in schools or other traditional training programs. All jobs 
require some specialized expertise, and many people develop their technical 
skills on the job.
People Skills The ability to understand, communicate with, motivate, and 
support other people, both individually and in groups, defines people 
skills. Many people may be technically proficient but poor listeners, unable 
to understand others’ needs, or weak at managing conflicts. Managers must 
have good people skills because they need to get things done through other 
people.
Conceptual Skills Managers must have the mental ability to analyze and diag￾nose complex situations. These tasks require conceptual skills. Decision mak￾ing, for instance, requires managers to identify problems, develop alternative 
solutions to correct those problems, evaluate those alternative solutions, and 
select the best one. After they have chosen a course of action, managers must 
organize a plan of action and then execute it. The abilities to integrate new 
ideas with existing processes and innovate on the job are also crucial conceptual 
skills for today’s managers.
Effective Versus Successful Managerial Activities
What makes one manager more effective than another? To answer this ques￾tion, Fred Luthans, a prominent OB researcher, and associates looked at what 
managers do from a somewhat different perspective.27 They asked, “Do man￾agers who move up most quickly in an organization do the same activities and 
with the same emphasis as managers who do the best job?” You might think the 
answer is yes, but that is not always the case.
Luthans and his associates studied more than 450 managers, all engaged in 
four managerial activities:
1. Traditional management. Decision making, planning, and controlling.
2. Communication. Exchanging routine information and processing 
paperwork.
3. Human resources (HR) management. Motivating, disciplining, managing 
conflict, staffing, and training.
4. Networking. Socializing, politicking, and interacting with outsiders.
technical skills The ability to apply 
specialized knowledge or expertise.
people skills The ability to work with, 
understand, and motivate other people, both 
individually and in groups.

analyze and diagnose complex situations.
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 42 13/12/22 1:55 AMWhat Is Organizational Behavior? CHAPTER 1 43
The “average” manager spent 32 percent of their time in traditional man￾agement activities, 29  percent communicating, 20  percent in HR manage￾ment activities, and 19 percent networking. However, the time and effort that 
different individual managers spent on those activities varied greatly. As shown 
in Exhibit 1-2, networking made the most considerable contribution among 
successful managers (defined in time to promotion within their organiza￾tion). HR management activities made the least relative contribution. Indeed, 
other studies in Australia, Israel, Italy, Japan, and the United States confirm 
the link between networking, social relationships, and success within an orga￾nization.28 However, Luthans and associates found that among effective man￾agers (defined in terms of quantity and quality of their performance and the 
satisfaction and commitment of employees), communication made the most 
considerable contribution and networking the least. The connection between 
communication and effective managers is also evident. Managers who explain 
their decisions and seek information from colleagues and employees—even if 
the information turns out to be negative—are the most effective.29
This research offers important insights. Successful (in terms of promotion) 
managers give almost the opposite emphases to traditional management, com￾munication, HR management, and networking as do effective managers. This 
finding challenges the historical assumption that promotions are based on per￾formance. Instead, it illustrates the importance of networking and political skills 
to getting ahead in organizations.
Organizational Behavior (OB) Defined
Now that we have established the importance of what workers and managers 
do, we turn our focus more broadly toward how people behave in organiza￾tions. Organizational behavior (OB) is a field of study investigating the impact 
that individuals, groups, and structure have on behavior within organizations to 
apply such knowledge toward improving an organization’s effectiveness. That is 
a mouthful, so let us break it down.
OB is a field of study, meaning that it is a distinct area of expertise with 
a common body of knowledge. It focuses on three determinants of behavior 
in organizations: individuals, groups, and structure and applies the knowledge 
gained about individuals, groups, and the effect of structure on behavior to 
make organizations work more effectively.
To sum up our definition, OB is the study of what people do in an organiza￾tion and how their behavior affects the organization’s performance. Because

OB is concerned specifically with employment-related situations, it examines 
behavior in the context of job attitudes, absenteeism, employee turnover, 
productivity, performance, and management. Although debate exists about 
the relative importance of each, OB includes these core topics: 30
• Performance, citizenship, 
deviance, and creativity
• Diversity and inclusion
• Job attitudes, emotions, and 
moods
• Personality and individual 
differences
• Judgment and decision making
• Motivation
• Justice and ethics in 
organizations
• Groups and teams
• Communication and 
relationships
• Leadership and management
• Power, politics, and corruption
• Conflict and negotiation
• Organizational theory and 
structure
• Organizational culture and 
climate
• Organizational health, stress, 
and safety
Complementing Intuition with 
Systematic Study
1-2 Show the value of 
systematic study to OB.
Whether you have explicitly thought about it before or not, you have been 
“reading” people almost all your life. You have watched their actions and inter￾preted what you see or tried to predict what people might do under different 
conditions. This casual approach to reading others can often lead to errone￾ous predictions, but using a systematic approach can improve your accuracy. 
Underlying the systematic approach in this text is the belief that behavior is not 
random. Instead, we can identify consistencies underlying people’s behavior 
and modify them to reflect individual differences.
These consistencies are fundamental. Why? Because they allow predictability. 
Behavior is generally predictable, and the systematic study of behavior is a way to 
make reasonably accurate predictions. When we use the term systematic study, we 
mean looking at relationships, attempting to attribute causes and effects, and bas￾ing our conclusions on scientific evidence. That is, we base our predictions on data 
gathered under controlled conditions and measured and interpreted rigorously.
Evidence-based management (EBM) complements systematic study by bas￾ing managerial decisions on the best available scientific evidence.31 For exam￾ple, we want doctors to make decisions about patient care based on the latest 
systematic study Looking at relationships, 
attempting to attribute causes and effects, 
and drawing conclusions based on scientific 
evidence.

Internet retailer Zappos.com under￾stands how organizational behavior 
affects an organization’s performance. 
The firm maintains good employee re￾lationships by offering generous bene￾fits, extensive training, and a positive 
work environment in which employees 
are encouraged “to create fun and a 
little weirdness.”
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 44 13/12/22 1:55 AMWhat Is Organizational Behavior? CHAPTER 1 45
available evidence. EBM argues that managers should do the same, thinking 
more scientifically about management problems. For instance, a manager might 
pose a question, search for the best available evidence, and apply the relevant 
information to the question or case at hand. You might wonder what manager 
would not base decisions on evidence. However, the vast majority of manage￾ment decisions are still made “on the fly,” with little to no systematic study of 
available evidence. Even more worrisome, there is mounting public distrust of 
scientists and researchers, which often leads managers to ignore evidence and 
“go with their guts.”32
But should we trust our guts? Systematic study and EBM add to intuition, or 
those “gut feelings” about what makes others (and ourselves) “tick.” Of course, 
the things you have come to believe in an unsystematic way are not necessarily 
incorrect. One review of hundreds of studies suggests that data-driven judgments 
(based on algorithms) were about ten percent more accurate than human’s intui￾tive judgments.33 Another study found that laypeople may prefer data-driven 
judgments to judgments made by others (e.g., experts) and even to judgments 
made by themselves, contrary to conventional wisdom.34 Jack Welch (former 
CEO of General Electric) noted, “The trick, of course, is to know when to go with 
your gut.” But if we make all decisions with intuition or gut instinct, we are likely 
working with incomplete information—like making an investment decision with 
only half the data about the potential for risk and reward. As such, EBM becomes 
a balancing act in which one critically weighs evidence from multiple sources. 
These sources include the opinions of professional experts and respected figures, 
evidence collected from one’s own business, and, of course, scientific evidence.35
Relying on intuition is made worse because we tend to overestimate what we 
think we know. Many managers hold so-called commonsense opinions regard￾ing effective management that have been flatly refuted by empirical evidence. 
Moreover, managers are often motivated to hold onto these beliefs even in 
the face of contradictory evidence. They negatively react to this information, 
especially when it counteracts their beliefs, self-image, self-interest, or iden￾tity.36 We find a similar problem in chasing the business and popular media for 
management wisdom.37 The business press tends to be dominated by fads, made 
worse by their proliferation through social media.38 As a writer for The New Yorker
put it, “Every few years, new companies succeed, and they are scrutinized for the 
underlying truths they might reveal. But often there is no underlying truth; the 
companies just happened to be in the right place at the right time.”39 Although 
we try to avoid it, we might also fall into this trap. It is not that the business press 
stories are all wrong; it is that without a systematic approach, it is difficult to accu￾rately conclude what makes prospering companies successful.
Building on Big Data with Artificial Intelligence
Data has been used to evaluate behavior since at least 1749. On this date, the 
word statistic was coined to mean a “description of the state.”40 Statistics back 
then were used for governance purposes, but since the data collection methods 
were clumsy and simplistic, so were the conclusions. Big data—the extensive use 
of statistical compilation and analysis—did not become possible until comput￾ers were sophisticated enough to store and manipulate large amounts of infor￾mation.41 Let us look at the roots of big data for business, which originated in 
online retailers’ marketing departments.
Background It is difficult to believe now, but not long ago, companies treated 
online shopping as a virtual point-of-sale experience. Shoppers browsed web￾sites anonymously, and sellers tracked sales data only on what customers bought. 
Gradually, online retailers began to track and act on customer preferences 
intuition An instinctive feeling not 
necessarily supported by research.
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 45 13/12/22 1:55 AM46 PART 1 Introduction
obtained through the Internet shopping experience. This knowledge was far 
superior to data gathered in simple store transactions. This action enabled them 
to create more targeted marketing strategies than ever before. The bookselling 
industry is a case in point. Before online selling, brick-and-mortar bookstores 
could collect data about book sales only to create projections about consumer 
interests and trends. With the advent of Amazon, suddenly a vast array of infor￾mation about consumer preferences became available for tracking. These pref￾erences included what customers bought, what they looked at, how they navi￾gated the site, and what influenced them (such as promotions, reviews, and 
page presentation). The challenge for Amazon was to identify which statistics 
were persistent , giving relatively constant outcomes over time, and which were 
predictive , showing steady causality between certain inputs and outcomes. The 
company used these statistics to develop algorithms to forecast which books cus￾tomers would like to read next. Amazon could then base its wholesale purchase 
decisions on the feedback customers provided, through both these passive col￾lection methods and solicited recommendations for upcoming titles. 
 Myth or Science? Management by Walking Around Is the Most 
Effective Management 
 T
his is mostly a myth, but with a 
caveat. Management by walk￾ing around (MBWA) is an organi￾zational principle made famous with 
the 1982 publication of In Search of 
Excellence and based on a 1970s initia￾tive by Hewlett-Packard—in other words, 
it is a dinosaur. Years of research indi￾cate that effective management prac￾tices are not built around MBWA. But 
the idea of requiring managers at all lev￾els of the organization to wander around 
their departments to observe, converse, 
and hear from employees continues as 
a standard business practice. 
 Many companies expecting man￾agers and executives to do regular 
“floor time” have claimed benefits 
from increased employee engage￾ment to deeper management under￾standing of company issues. A three￾year study also suggested that a 
modified form of MBWA may signifi￾cantly improve safety in organizations 
because employees become more 
mindful of following regulatory proce￾dures when supervisors observe and 
monitor them frequently. 
 While MBWA sounds helpful, its limi￾tations suggest that modern practices 
focused on building trust and relation￾ships are more useful for manage￾ment. Limitations include available 
hours, focus, and application. 
1. Available hours. Managers are 
charged with planning, organiz￾ing, coordinating, and controlling. 
Yet even CEOs—the managers 
who should be the most in con￾trol of their time—report spend￾ing 53  percent of their average 
55-hour workweek in time-wasting 
meetings. 
2. Focus. MBWA turns management’s 
focus toward the concerns of 
employees. Such a focus is good, 
but only to a degree. As noted 
by Jeff Weiner, chair of LinkedIn, 
“Part of the key to time manage￾ment is carving out time to think, 
as opposed to constantly react￾ing. And during that thinking time, 
you’re not only thinking strategi￾cally, thinking proactively, think￾ing longer-term, but you’re literally 
thinking about what is urgent ver￾sus important.” Weiner and other 
executives argue that meetings dis￾tract them from their purpose. 
3. Application. The principle behind 
MBWA is that the more managers 
know their employees, the more 
effective those managers will be. This 
principle is not always (or even often) 
true. As we will learn in the chapter 
on Perception and Individual Decision 
Making, knowing something (or think￾ing we know it) should not always 
lead us to act on only that informa￾tion. Our internal decision making is 
subjective—as such, we need objec￾tive data to make the most effective 
management decisions. 
 Based on the need for managers to 
dedicate their efforts to administering 
and growing businesses and given the 
proven effectiveness of objective per￾formance measures, it seems the time 
for MBWA is gone. Yet there is that one 
caveat: Managers should know their 
employees well. As Rick Russell, former 
president of Minerva Neurosciences, 
says, “Fostering close ties with your 
lieutenants is the stuff that gets 
results. You have to rally the troops. You 
can’t do it from a memo.” Management 
should, therefore, not substitute walking 
around for actual management. 42 
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 46 13/12/22 1:55 AMWhat Is Organizational Behavior? CHAPTER 1 47
It is good news for the future of business that researchers, the media, and com￾pany leaders have identified the potential of data-driven management and decision 
making. A manager who uses data to define objectives, develop theories of causal￾ity, and test those theories can determine which employee activities are relevant to 
their objectives.43 Big data is increasingly applied toward managing organizational 
change and making effective decisions (which we discuss in Chapter 6 on percep￾tion and decision making). Managers seem to be reacting well to it. For instance, in 
one study, managers were given automated, data-driven decision support systems to 
assist them with their hiring tasks. In this study, managers reported being happier 
with and more confident in the decisions they made.44
Current Usage No matter how many terabytes of data firms collect or from how 
many sources, the reasons for data analytics are essentially the same. They include 
predicting any event, from a book purchase to a spacesuit malfunction; detecting 
how much risk is incurred at any time, from the risk of a fire to that of a loan 
default; and preventing catastrophes large and small, from a plane crash to an over￾stock of product.45 With big data, United States defense contractor BAE Systems 
protects itself from cyberattacks. San Francisco’s Bank of the West uses customer 
data to create tiered pricing systems. As a final example, London’s Graze.com ana￾lyzes customers’ preferences to select snack samples to send with their orders.46
Naturally, big data has been used by technology companies like Google and 
Facebook, which rely on advertising dollars for revenue and thus need to predict 
user behavior. Companies like Netflix and Uber similarly use big data to pre￾dict where and when customers may want to use their services. Insurance firms 
predict behavior to assess risks, such as the chance of traffic accidents, to set cus￾tomer premiums. Even museums like the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 
New York, the Dallas Museum of Art, and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts ana￾lyze data from transmitters, kiosks, and surveys to cater to their paying guests.47
Online retailers like eBay and Amazon that market tangible products through 
online platforms also rely on big data to predict what will sell. For organizations 
like Nielson, which tracks television and radio watching, the results of data analy￾ses are the product they sell. Still other organizations collect big data but do not 
use it directly. These are often organizations whose primary business is not online. 
Kroger, a United States grocery store chain, collects electronic information from 
55 million customers who have loyalty cards and sells the data to vendors who 
stock Kroger’s shelves.48 Sometimes technology companies simply sell their data; 
Twitter sells 500 million tweets a day to four data assimilation companies.49
New Trends The use of big data to understand, help, and manage people is 
relatively new but is “as ubiquitous as the air we breathe.”50 In fact, research on 
10,000 workers in China, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States indicated that transformations in the way work is performed will rely 
more on technological advancements than on any other factor.51 Organizations 
are also beginning to focus on “fast data,” emphasizing a consistent influx of 
actionable data to guide business decisions in real time.52
Big data has enabled organizations to acquire and manage large amounts 
of data and information (sometimes with more variables than people!).53 Even 
more recent advancements have shifted toward processing and analyzing all this 
information.54 One way organizations have been able to adapt to the massive 
amounts of data and the sheer speed at which it is acquired is through artifi￾cial intelligence (AI; i.e., machines programmed to think, work, and react like 
humans).55 When you think of AI, your mind may wander to robots, regard￾less of your status as a Star Trek or Star Wars fan. We are certainly seeing robotics
becoming used in the workplace (for example, robots can help hospital night 
staff remotely assist their patients during night rounds).56 However, much of 
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 47 13/12/22 1:55 AM48 PART 1 Introduction
the current focus has been on machine learning (i.e., a subset of AI in which 
software is trained to perform a task while at the same time “learning” and 
“improving” from incoming data and feedback).57 Indeed, 60 percent of the 
billions of dollars invested in AI has been allocated toward machine learning.58
Machine learning has contributed immensely to many organizations’ success, 
especially those in the e-commerce industry. One estimate suggests that over 
a third of Amazon transactions stem from AI-facilitated product recommenda￾tions.59 In the coming chapters, we discuss how and in what ways big data and AI 
approaches have contributed to the study and practice of OB. In the meantime, 
here are some examples of novel methods researchers and organizations have 
used to apply big data to study OB:60
• Robotics
• Artificial intelligence/machine learning
• Serious games and gamification (i.e., designing games that inherently col￾lect rich data on worker behavior to improve training, hiring, and even 
worker attitudes)
• “Always on” technology (i.e., devices that are continuously “on” and con￾stantly collect data, such as smartphones and digital assistants)
• Mobile sensors and biometrics (i.e., wearable technology that monitors 
biometric data, such as sleep quality and heart rate)
• Social media (i.e., data concerning interactions between and among 
groups of people, including social networking and the formation/dissolu￾tion of relationships)
• Text or sentiment analysis (i.e., analyzing the words or phrases people use 
in electronic communication to determine mood and personality traits)
Limitations As technological capabilities for handling big data and AI have 
increased, so have privacy issues and appropriate application.61 This limitation 
is particularly true when data collection includes surveillance instruments. For 
instance, an experiment in Brooklyn, New York, was designed to improve res￾idents’ quality of life. The researchers collected intensive data from infrared 
cameras, sensors, and smartphone Wi-Fi signals on these residents.62 A bank call 
center and a pharmaceutical company (through similar methods) found that 
employees were more productive with more social interaction, so they changed 
their break-time policies so more people took breaks together. They then saw 
sales increase and turnover decrease. Bread Winners Café in Dallas, Texas, 
continuously monitors all restaurant employees through surveillance and uses 
the data to promote or discipline its servers.63 These big data tactics and oth￾ers might yield results. For instance, research indicates that surveillance may 
increase task performance and citizenship behavior (helping behaviors toward 
others), at least in the short term.64
But critics point out that after Frederick Taylor introduced surveillance ana￾lytics in 1911 to increase productivity, these techniques were surpassed by Alfred 
Sloan’s greater success, achieved by providing meaningful work to employees.65
Further, pioneering studies at the Hawthorne Western Electric plant demon￾strated the massive role of group dynamics and norms. From these studies, 
productivity was a function of both whether workers feel management cares 
about them and the social forces that cause group members to behave in certain 
ways.66 In other words, it is less about the direct effect of surveillance on workers 
but more so a function of the social forces at play.
These issues bring up a larger concern: What do people think about big 
data when they are the data source? Organizations using big data run the risk of 
offending the very people they are trying to influence: employees and custom￾ers. As Alderman Bob Fioretti said about the 65 sensors installed on Chicago’s 
streets, “This type of invasion is a very slippery slope.”67 The use of AI also has its 
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 48 13/12/22 1:55 AMWhat Is Organizational Behavior? CHAPTER 1 49
own privacy and appropriateness issues.68 Despite traditional concerns regard￾ing the safety and job security threats robots and automation bring to mind,69
perhaps the most straightforward limitation is that machines can often fail to 
capture the obvious “big picture” and may ignore their limits.70 For example, 
an algorithm may inadvertently include pizza topping preferences in predicting 
which employees are more likely to steal at work. Research demonstrates that 
it is crucial for machine learning to be supervised to avoid atheoretical predic￾tions and decision making.71 AI may also be used to engage in unethical behav￾iors at work. For example, Facebook banned a large UK car insurance company 
from mining users’ social media information, learning their personality traits, 
and charging them different premiums based on their personality traits (and 
predictions for how safely they would drive).72
We must keep in mind that big data will always be limited in predicting 
behavior, curtailing risk, and preventing catastrophes. In contrast to the rep￾licable results we can obtain through big data, human behavior can often be 
unpredictable and elusive. Otherwise, our decision making would have been 
taken over by artificial intelligence by now! But that will never be a worthy 
goal.73 Management is more than the sum of data. Overall, we do not advise 
you to throw your intuition out the window. We are also not suggesting you 
base all your decisions on a machine learning algorithm. In dealing with peo￾ple, leaders often rely on hunches, and sometimes the outcomes are excellent. 
At other times, human tendencies get in the way. The prudent use of big data 
and AI, along with an understanding of human behavioral tendencies, can 
contribute to sound decision making and ease natural biases. What we are
advising is to use evidence as much as possible to inform your decisions. That 
is the promise of OB.
Disciplines That Contribute to OB
1-3 Identify the major 
behavioral science 
disciplines that contribute 
to OB.
OB is an applied behavioral science built on contributions from several behav￾ioral disciplines, mainly psychology and social psychology, sociology, and 
anthropology. Psychology’s contributions have been principally at the indi￾vidual or micro level of analysis. In contrast, the other disciplines have con￾tributed to our understanding of macro concepts such as group processes and 
organization. Exhibit 1-3 is an overview of the major contributions of other 
disciplines to the study of OB. In turn, OB has influenced the working world, 
specifically HR practices (e.g., work design, training, employee selection, per￾formance appraisal).
Psychology
Psychology seeks to measure, explain, and sometimes change humans and 
other animals’ behavior. Contributors to OB’s knowledge are learning theorists; 
personality theorists; counseling psychologists; and, most important, industrial 
and organizational psychologists.
Early industrial/organizational psychologists studied fatigue, boredom, and 
other working conditions that could impede efficient work performance. More 
recently, their contributions have expanded to include learning, perception, 
personality, emotions, training, leadership effectiveness, needs, motivational 
forces, job satisfaction, decision-making processes, performance appraisal, atti￾tude measurement, employee-selection techniques, work design, and job stress. 
The study of emotions and moods, in particular, has been immensely transfor￾mative in the study of OB, leading to an “Affective Revolution.” This revolution 
heavily impacted (and continues to influence) OB research across virtually all 
of the “contributions” in Exhibit 1-3.74

M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 49 13/12/22 1:55 AM50 PART 1 Introduction
Social Psychology
Social psychology, generally considered a branch of psychology, blends concepts 
from psychology and sociology to focus on people’s influence on one another. 
One central study area is change —how to implement it and reduce barriers to 
its acceptance. Social psychologists also contribute to measuring, understand￾ing, and changing attitudes; identifying communication patterns; and building 
trust. They have made significant contributions to our study of group behavior, 
power, and conflict.
Sociology
While psychology focuses on the individual, sociology studies people in rela￾tion to their social environment or culture. Sociologists have contributed to OB 
by studying group behaviors in organizations, particularly formal and complex 
organizations. Perhaps most important, sociologists have studied organizational 
culture, formal organization theory and structure, organizational technology, 
communications, power, and conflict.

Anthropology
Anthropology is the study of societies to learn about human beings and their 
activities. Anthropologists’ work on cultures and environments has helped us 
understand differences in fundamental values, attitudes, and behavior among 
people in different countries and organizations. Much of our current under￾standing of organizational culture, organizational climate, and differences 
among national cultures results from anthropologists’ work or those using their 
methods.
There Are Few Absolutes in OB
anthropology The study of societies 
to learn about human beings and their 
activities.
1-4 Demonstrate why few 
absolutes apply to OB.
Laws in the physical sciences—chemistry, astronomy, physics—are consistent 
and apply in various situations. They allow scientists to generalize about the 
pull of gravity or be confident about sending astronauts into space to repair 
satellites. Human beings are complex, and few, if any, simple and universal 
principles explain organizational behavior. Because we are not alike, our 
ability to make simple, accurate generalizations about ourselves is limited. 
Two people often act very differently in the same situation, and the same 
person’s behavior changes in different cases. For example, you may behave 
much differently during a job interview than you would with your friends 
on a Saturday morning. Of course, this does not mean that we cannot offer 
reasonably accurate explanations of human behavior or make valid predic￾tions. It does mean that OB concepts must reflect situational or contingency 
conditions. We can say x leads to y, but only under conditions specified in 
z—the contingency variables.
OB was developed by applying general concepts to a particular situation, 
person, or group. For example, OB scholars and practitioners would avoid stat￾ing that everyone likes complex and challenging work (a generalization). Why? 
Because not everyone wants a challenging job. Some people prefer routine 
over varied work or simple over complex tasks. A job attractive to one person 
may not be to another; its appeal is contingent on the person who holds it. 
Often, we find both general effects and contingencies. For instance, money 
does have some ability to motivate most of us (a general effect). On the con￾trary, some of us are more motivated by money than others, and some situa￾tions are more about money than others (both contingencies). We will best 
understand OB when we realize how both general effects and their contingen￾cies guide behavior.
Challenges and Opportunities
contingency variables Situational factors 
or variables that moderate the relationship 
between two or more variables.
1-5 Identify managers’ challenges 
and opportunities in applying 
OB concepts.
Understanding organizational behavior has never been more critical for manag￾ers. Take a quick look at the dramatic changes in organizations. The workforce 
is becoming increasingly diverse; organizations are continuing to develop a 
global, integrated presence; technology is revolutionizing how (and where) we 
do work; managers are increasingly interested in the role that justice and ethics 
play in the workplace; organizations are beginning to focus on their responsi￾bilities to the environment, societies, and communities—and at the same time 
developing strengths in workers; and finally, the nature of work itself has been 
shifting with the advent of the “Gig Economy” and global crises, such as the 
COVID-19 pandemic.75
In short, today’s challenges bring opportunities for managers to use OB con￾cepts. In this section, we review some—but not nearly all—of the critical devel￾oping issues confronting managers. OB offers solutions to these challenges and 
opportunities—or at least meaningful insights toward solutions.
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 51 13/12/22 1:55 AM52 PART 1 Introduction
Workforce Diversity and Inclusion
With the advent of social movements such as #metoo and Black Lives Matter,76
organizations, their management and leadership, and workers worldwide are 
continuing to realize the importance of workforce diversity in crafting equitable, 
inclusive workplaces. One of the most compelling opportunities for organiza￾tions is managing workforce diversity, which recognizes that the workforce is 
heterogeneous in its gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, 
and other characteristics.77
Beyond recognizing diversity, all organization members are responsible for 
doing something about it if a fair, equitable, and productive workplace is to be 
realized. Workforce inclusion focuses on creating and maintaining workplaces 
that support and leverage their members’ diversity.78 Inclusion compels the 
workforce and managers to recognize that people are like mosaics, character￾ized by tiles representing the various identities and value systems that “make 
them who they are.”79 An inclusive workplace is one in which workers feel that 
they are involved in critical processes, feel welcomed and valued, and are treated 
as “insiders.”80
As an example of diversity and inclusion in action in the modern workplace, 
longevity and birth rates have changed organizations’ dynamics. Global longev￾ity rates have increased by about six years in a very short time (since 2000—the 
fastest increase since the 1960s),81 while birth rates have decreased in many 
developed countries. Together, these trends indicate a lasting shift toward an 
older workforce. First, OB research can explain what this means for attitudes, 
organizational culture, leadership, structure, and communication, among other 
core OB topics. Second, managers and organizations need to think about how 
best to craft an inclusive workplace for older workers while reducing discrimina￾tion and prejudice in their practices.82
Socioeconomic shifts also have a profound effect on workforce diversity. 
Equal access to work and education, regardless of gender identity or sexual ori￾entation, has been deemed a human rights issue by the United Nations (see OB 
Poll).83 Despite increasing representation in the workforce, people of various 
demographic backgrounds (e.g., gender identities and sexual orientations) con￾tinue to experience inequality, underrepresentation as managers, prejudice, and 
even violence.84 OB researchers study how people from diverse backgrounds 
fare in the workplace, the unique challenges and benefits they experience, and 
how their conditions can be improved. This example is just one way cultural and 
socioeconomic changes affect workforce diversity, and it is one of many. We will 
discuss how OB can provide insights on workforce issues throughout this text.
Though we have more to say about diversity in the next chapter, we start here 
by saying that diversity presents promising opportunities and poses challenging 
questions for managers and employees. How can we recognize the strengths 
in our diversity? How can we adapt to accommodate each other’s differences? 
What are the legal requirements in each country that protect workplaces from 
prejudice, discrimination, and inequality? Does workforce diversity lead to posi￾tive outcomes for employees and organizations? What can employees, manag￾ers, and organizations do to manage diversity effectively? It is vital to address the 
spoken and unspoken concerns of organizations today.
Continuing Globalization
Globalization has led organizations, leaders, and employees to become increas￾ingly connected across the globe, now more than ever.85 Globalization refers to 
the process in which worldwide integration and interdependence are promoted 
across national borders. Samsung, the largest South Korean business conglom￾erate, sells most of its products to organizations in other countries; a Brazilian 
firm owns Burger King; and McDonald’s operates in over one hundred countries

and teams that recognize that their workers

on six continents. Although globalization united the international community 
following the Second World War, the slow recovery from the global financial cri￾sis has caused much of the world’s population to be embittered by globaliza￾tion. 86 In modern times, the world is at a tension point in which societies choose 
between sectioning off their economies and remaining open to the world, given 
how globalization can change the employment landscape rapidly for many com￾munities, sometimes resulting in poverty and economic inequality. 87 Meanwhile, 
we are on the brink of a new Industrial Revolution, disrupting many industries 
and leaving many without jobs. 88 One of the unique challenges of this tide of 
globalization is to forge cooperation between organizations and their employees 
worldwide and pursue the public good with social responsibility in mind. 
 Furthermore, as a result of globalization, the manager’s job has changed. 
To be effective in the workplace, you should try to anticipate and adapt your 
approach to the global issues we discuss next. 
Increased Expatriate Assignments You are much more likely to find yourself 
working outside your native country as an expatriate . For instance, you might 
find yourself transferred to your employer’s operating division or subsidiary in 
another country. Once there, you will have to interact with a workforce with 
very different needs, aspirations, and attitudes than those you are used to back 
home. To be effective, you will need to understand everything you can about 
your new location’s culture and workforce (i.e., demonstrating your cultural 
sensitivity). Understanding what leads to success for expatriate assignments is 
critical to organizations. For instance, one UK consulting firm estimates that the 
average expatriate assignment costs $311,000 per year —a high price to pay when 
considering that 40 percent of all expatriate assignments end up in failure. 89
Working With People From Different Cultures Even in your own country, you will 
find yourself working with people born and raised in different cultures. What 
motivates you may not motivate them. Or your communication style may be 
straightforward and blunt, which others may find rude or threatening. To work 
effectively with people from different cultures, you need to understand how their 
culture and background have shaped them and how to adapt your management 
style to accommodate these differences. For instance, managers need to know 
the workforce’s cultural norms in each country where they do business. A large 
percentage of the workforce enjoys long holidays in some countries. There will be 
country and local regulations to consider, too. Managers of subsidiaries abroad 
need to be aware of the unique financial and legal regulations applying to guest 
 expatriate A person who works outside 
their native country.

companies or risk violating them. Violations can have implications for operations 
in that country and political relations between countries. Managers also need to be 
mindful of differences in regulations for competitors in that country; understand￾ing the laws can often lead to success rather than failure. For example, knowing 
local banking laws allowed one multinational firm—the Bank of China—to seize 
a storied (and priceless) London building, Grosvenor House, from the owner, the 
Indian hotel group Sahara. Management at Sahara contends that the loan default 
that led to the seizure was a misunderstanding regarding one of its other proper￾ties in New York.90 Globalization can get complicated.
Technology and Social Media
Technology, such as the advancements in AI discussed earlier, has profoundly 
affected the business world. As another example, many organizations continue 
to struggle with employees’ social media use in the workplace. In February 
2015, a Texas pizzeria fired an employee before the first day of work because 
of an unflattering tweet about the job. In December 2014, Nordstrom fired an 
Oregon employee who had posted a personal Facebook comment seeming to 
advocate violence against police officers.91 These examples show that social 
media is a complicated issue for today’s managers, presenting both a challenge 
and an opportunity for OB. For instance, should HR investigate a candidate’s 
social media presence? Should a hiring manager read the candidate’s Twitter 
feed or just do a quick perusal of their Facebook profile? How can managers 
attract applicants and customers through their own social media presence?92
Managers need to adopt evidence-based policies designed to protect employees 
and their organizations with balance and understanding.
Once employees are on the job, many organizations have policies about 
accessing social media at work—when, where, and for what purposes. But what 
about the impact of social media on employee well-being? One recent study 
found that subjects who woke up in a positive mood and then accessed Facebook 
frequently found that their mood worsened during the day. Moreover, these sub￾jects also reported decreased satisfaction with their lives.93 Managers—and the 
field of OB—are trying to increase employee attitudes and therefore improve 
and enhance positive organizational outcomes.
On the other hand, some organizations have policies that reinforce an 
“always-on” culture. The typical employee in the 1960s and 1970s showed 
up at a specified workplace Monday through Friday and worked for clearly 
defined eight- or nine-hour chunks of time. That is no longer true for a large 
segment of today’s workforce because the workplace definition has expanded 
to include anywhere a laptop or smartphone can go. Even if employees work 
flexible hours or remotely from home (or from half a continent away), man￾agers still need to consider their well-being. One of the biggest challenges to 
maintaining employee well-being is the new reality that many workers never 
get away from the virtual workplace. While technology allows many employees 
to do their work at home or on the beach in Tahiti, it also means that many 
feel like they are not part of a team. “The sense of belonging is very chal￾lenging for virtual workers, who seem to be all alone out in cyberland,” said 
Ellen Raineri of Kaplan University.94 Another challenge is that organizations 
are asking employees to put in longer hours. According to one study, one in 
four employees shows signs of burnout, and two in three report high stress 
levels and fatigue.95 These findings may be an underestimate because workers 
report maintaining “always-on” access for their managers through e-mail and 
texting. Finally, employee well-being is challenged by heavy outside commit￾ments. For instance, millions of single-parent employees and employees with 
dependent parents face significant challenges in balancing work and family 
responsibilities.
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 54 13/12/22 1:55 AMWhat Is Organizational Behavior? CHAPTER 1 55
As a result of their increased responsibilities in and out of the workplace, 
employees want jobs that give them flexibility in their work schedules to man￾age work–life conflicts better.96 In fact, 56 percent of people in a recent study 
reported that work–life balance, more than money, recognition, and autonomy, 
was their definition of career success.97 Most college and university students say 
attaining a balance between personal life and work is a primary career goal; they 
want a life and a job. Organizations that do not help their employees achieve 
work–life balance will find it increasingly difficult to attract and retain the most 
capable and motivated individuals. Although a flexible, remote job seemed to be 
a dream to be attained one day for many workers, the COVID-19 pandemic pro￾pelled many workers to work indefinitely in this format. This experience in and 
of itself has proved to be a massive experiment on a global scale.98 Given these 
significant changes, we believe a focus on technologies (e.g., AI, social media, 
and remote work) will substantially affect OB for years to come. Throughout the 
text, we will discuss how technology interfaces with each of OB’s core topics. As 
you will see in later chapters, the field of OB offers several suggestions to guide 
managers to leverage technology effectively.
(Un)ethical Behavior
The corporate world is characterized by cutbacks, expectations of increasing 
productivity, and tough competition. It is not surprising that many employees 
feel pressured to cut corners, break the rules, and engage in other questionable 
practices. They increasingly face ethical dilemmas and ethical choices in which 
they are required to identify right and wrong conduct. Should they “blow the 
whistle” if they uncover illegal activities in their company? Do they follow orders 
with which they do not personally agree? Do they “play politics” to advance 
their careers?
How workers, managers, and people react to these ethical dilemmas and eth￾ical choices results in (un)ethical behavior. Unethical behavior is any action that 
violates widely accepted moral norms (e.g., lying, cheating, stealing, harming 
others). In contrast, ethical behavior meets or exceeds widely accepted moral 
norms (e.g., following the rules, going above self-interest to help others).99 Most 
of the time, unethical behavior negatively affects workers’ and managers’ per￾formance and withdrawal behaviors, teams’ performance, and organizations’ 
productivity (see the next section for these variables defined and described as 
outcomes). Furthermore, as we discuss in the chapter on job attitudes, these 
behaviors can often be referred to as counterproductive work behaviors (CWB) 
that actively damage the organization. However, it is essential to state that not 
all unethical behaviors are counterproductive.
100 For instance, entrepreneurs may 
lie to potential clients about their production capacity to earn their business 
(i.e., a legitimacy lie)101—an action that would help their organization. Regardless 
of their utility, lying is still immoral and classified as unethical behavior. These 
nuances highlight the complexity of ethics in organizations and warrant their 
continued study and understanding as a student of OB.
As suggested earlier, what constitutes good, ethical behavior has never been 
clearly defined. The line differentiating right from wrong is blurry. We see peo￾ple all around us engaging in unethical practices: elected officials pad expense 
accounts or take bribes; corporate executives inflate profits to cash in lucra￾tive stock options; and university administrators look the other way when win￾ning coaches encourage scholarship athletes to take easy courses or even, in the 
case of the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill, sham courses with fake 
grades.102 When people are caught, we see them give excuses such as “everyone 
does it” or “you have to seize every advantage.”
Today’s manager must create an ethical culture and climate for employees 
to do their work productively with minimal ambiguity about right and wrong 
ethical dilemmas and ethical choices
Situations in which individuals are required 
to define right and wrong conduct.
(un)ethical behavior Any actions that 
violate widely accepted moral norms. 
Conversely, ethical behaviors are any actions 
that meet or exceed widely accepted moral 
norms.

behaviors. Companies that promote a strong ethical mission, encourage 
employees to behave with integrity, and provide strong leadership can influ￾ence employees to behave ethically.103 Companies that promote justice in how 
rewards and resources are allocated (i.e., the equal treatment of all), how proce￾dures are defined, how people are treated, and how information is distributed 
can help improve worker perceptions of fairness.104 Ethics training has also 
proven helpful in maintaining a higher level of awareness of the implications of 
ethical choices, as long as the training sessions are given on an ongoing basis.105
In upcoming chapters, we will discuss the actions managers can take to create 
ethical cultures, climates, and structures as well as provide practical guidance to 
help workers make sense of ethically charged situations.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Would you be as happy to work for an organization with a stated social wel￾fare mission as one without? An organization’s commitment to corporate social 
responsibility (CSR), or its self-regulated actions to benefit society or the envi￾ronment beyond what is required by law, has become increasingly important in 
the working world. Organizations practice CSR in several ways, including envi￾ronmental sustainability initiatives, nonprofit work, volunteering, charitable giv￾ing, and even more traditional HR practices such as sustainability training and 
development.106
CSR is good for the planet and good for people. Research suggests that CSR 
positively affects worker attitudes, turnover intentions, and performance. CSR 
has an even larger effect on discretionary behaviors such as organizational citi￾zenship behavior (OCB) and deviance (discussed later in this chapter).107 In 
fact, of 59 large and small organizations surveyed, 86  percent reported they 
have happier employees because of their CSR programs.108 Workers respond 
well to CSR for several reasons. CSR can lead workers to identify more strongly 
with their organizations, experience a sense of meaningfulness for giving back, 
feel as if they belong to something greater than themselves, or even fulfill more 
egoistic needs (engaging in CSR to advance one’s agenda).109 CSR is also good 
for business. One meta-analysis across 42 studies found that CSR efforts predict 
organizations’ financial performance.110
Although CSR’s influence is increasing year after year, not all employees find 
value in it.111 Therefore, organizations need to address a few issues to be most 
effective. First, not all projects are equally meaningful for every person, yet all 
employees’ participation is sometimes expected. For instance, Lisa Dewey, a part￾ner at one of the world’s largest law firms, said, “All DLA Piper attorneys and 
staff are encouraged to participate in the firm’s pro bono and volunteer proj￾ects.”112 Second, some organizations require employees to contribute in a pre￾scribed manner. For instance, consulting firm SHIFT’s co-founder and CEO, Joe 
Mechlinksi, requires employees to participate in “Give Back Days” by serving in 
a soup kitchen, building a Habitat for Humanity house, or mentoring children. 
These choices may not fit every individual’s vision of CSR. Pressuring people to 
go “above and beyond” in ways that are not natural for them can burn them out 
for future CSR projects,113 particularly when CSR projects directly benefit the 
organization (such as positive press coverage).114 People want CSR to be genuine 
and authentic. Third, CSR measures can seem disconnected from the employ￾ee’s actual work.115 After watching consulting firm KPMG’s “over the top” video 
that boasted of involvement in Nelson Mandela’s election and the end of apart￾heid, the launch of the first space station by NASA, and the freedom of United 
States hostages in Iran, one anonymous employee questioned their employment. 
“If I want to really make a change,” they said, “why would I sit here?”116
corporate social responsibility (CSR) An 
organization’s self-regulated actions to 
benefit society or the environment beyond 
what is required by law.
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 56 13/12/22 1:55 AMWhat Is Organizational Behavior? CHAPTER 1 57
 Regardless, “the next generation of employees is seeking out employers 
that are focused on the triple bottom line: people, planet, and revenue,” said 
Susan Cooney, founder of philanthropy firm Givelocity. 117 CSR allows workers 
to serve a higher purpose or contribute to a mission. However, an organiza￾tion’s CSR efforts must be well governed, and its initiatives must be sustainable 
for long-term benefits. 118 In sum, CSR is a needed, positive trend of account￾ability and serving. It has also become a significant part of organizational life. 
Throughout the text, we highlight the intersection between CSR and several 
core OB topics in both the text and our new feature, “Toward a Better World.”
 Toward a Better World 
 Ben & Jerry’s: The Scoop on What It Takes to 
Be a CSR-Oriented Company 
 Ben & Jerry’s, an ice cream maker 
headquartered in Vermont, is often 
touted as the poster child for corpo￾rate social responsibility (CSR). From 
humble beginnings, Ben & Jerry’s has 
a storied history of making unique, 
chunky ice cream flavors, churning out 
immense profits on just about a yearly 
basis, and eventually being acquired 
by a major corporation. But despite all 
these changes throughout the com￾pany’s history, their commitment to a 
triple bottom line has been unwaver￾ing. Ben & Jerry’s continues to focus 
on making excellent ice cream, encour￾aging sustainable growth, and “making 
the world a better place.” 
 To this aim, the company is commit￾ted to ethical sourcing and purchasing, 
manufacturing processes that reduce 
its impact on the environment, and giv￾ing back to the local community through 
philanthropy and service. Further, Ben 
& Jerry’s is not milquetoast (that would 
probably be a terrible ice cream flavor, 
we think) when it comes to standing up 
for issues important to them. In fact, 
an entire page on their website is dedi￾cated to the issues that are important 
to the company (including their support 
of the Black Lives Matter movement 
in 2020), along with the ice cream fla￾vors they have used to raise money 
and awareness for those issues. 
Their annual Social & Environmental 
Assessment Report (SEAR) documents 
their progress toward making the world 
a better place. In 2019, for instance, 
they eliminated 245,000 pounds of 
plastic packaging, straws, and spoons. 
 However, Ben & Jerry’s has not gone 
without critique. The pretty picture of 
what it takes to be a CSR-oriented com￾pany often focuses on the successes, 
but rarely do we see the failures. For 
instance, in the 1990s, one researcher 
uncovered actions with good intentions 
gone wrong. As some examples, many 
have taken issue with the price of the 
ice cream as too high or with the exces￾sive fat and sugar content packed into 
each pint. Furthermore, Ben & Jerry’s 
efforts to ethically source nuts in the 
Western Amazon resulted in a supply 
shortage. The company was forced to 
source from less-than-reputable suppli￾ers as a result. Finally, in the 1990s, 
Ben & Jerry’s partnered with a bakery 
in New Jersey that employed recover￾ing drug addicts and alcoholics. After 
forging a partnership (and the bakery 
owner investing hundreds of thou￾sands in scaling to meet anticipated 
demand), the collaborative ice cream 
flavor’s sales were too low and not 
viable, forcing the company to cut ties 
with the bakery. 
 Despite these failures and suc￾cesses, Ben & Jerry’s stays com￾mitted to its triple bottom line, even 
when the public closely scrutinized 
Unilever’s acquisition of Ben & Jerry’s 
in 2000. This acquisition has been 
the subject of many research studies 
by OB scientists. For instance, one 
study focused on CEO letters and 
interviews with long-tenured employ￾ees and newcomers to Ben & Jerry’s 
over a 30-year span. It found that, fol￾lowing the acquisition, employees had 
to “whipsaw” back and forth between 
the triple bottom line and the finan￾cial performance desired by the post￾acquisition CEOs. Further, another 
research study found that the acquir￾ing organization (Unilever) may have 
been influenced more by Ben & Jerry’s 
than the other way around—adopting 
and promoting CSR practices. Many 
consider the threat of acquisition 
(in terms of erasing or modifying the 
company’s original mission) to be a 
compelling reason for a company’s 
leadership to consider becoming 
Certified B Corporations. Like Cabot, 
New Belgium Brewing, and Patagonia, 
these corporations are legally required 
to balance their mission and profit—to 
evaluate their effect on their people, 
the community, and the environment. 
Indeed, Ben & Jerry’s followed suit 
and became a B-Corp in 2012. 
 In short, the case of Ben & Jerry’s 
personifies the pursuits, the successes, 
and the struggles of being a CSR￾oriented company in the twenty-first cen￾tury. Although things are not always as 
easy as eating ice cream, organizations 
can still take a stand for what they value 
and put these values into action—and 
can do so with success. 119

Positive Work Environments
Positive organizational scholarship (also called positive organizational behav￾ior) has been a real area for growth in OB. It explores how organizations 
develop human strengths, foster vitality, build resilience, and unlock poten￾tial.120 Researchers in this area say too many OB research and management 
practices try to identify what is wrong with organizations and their employees. 
In response, they try to study what is good about them.121 Some key topics in 
positive OB research are engagement, hope, optimism, and resilience in the 
face of strain. Researchers hope to help practitioners create positive work envi￾ronments for employees.
Although positive organizational scholarship does not deny the value of the 
negative (such as critical feedback), it does challenge us to look at OB through a 
new lens, pushing organizations to develop employees’ strengths rather than dwell 
on their limitations. One aspect of an organization’s positive work environment 
is its culture, discussed in depth in a later chapter on the topic. Organizational 
culture influences employee behavior so strongly that organizations have begun 
to employ culture officers to shape and preserve their personality.122
The Gig Economy
As noted earlier in the chapter, today we find ourselves amid the Gig Economy, a 
new era of work in which many people work independently and autonomously 
(“a company of one”) instead of the highly structured employer–employee 
relations of the past.123 Today, about one-fifth of United States workers work 
independently as gig workers.124 Further, data from the Rand-Princeton 
Contingent Worker survey suggests that these instances of “gig employment” 
increased by 5.7  percent over the decade 2005–2015. Astoundingly, almost 
all of the employment growth observed during that decade was attributable 
to gig work.125 This transformation in the world of work has led to several 
changes in the worker experience, such as financial instability, job insecurity, 
autonomy, career path uncertainty, the transience of work, and physical and 
relational separation.126 These changes have led to many challenges for gig 
workers. They navigate a new world where they come to grips with their emo￾tions, identity, and relationships; struggle to structure work to stay in business; 
and compete to remain viable.127
Exhibit 1-4 details some of the characteristics of employment in the Gig 
Economy, the new world of work. Under each heading in this exhibit, you will 
find a grouping of options that may combine to characterize jobs. For instance, 
you may find yourself employed full-time in an office in a localized, nonunion set￾ting with a salary and bonus compensation package at one point in your career. In 
contrast, at another point, you find yourself in a flexible, virtual position, choos￾ing to work from overseas for a combination of salary and extra paid time off.
What led to the emergence of the Gig Economy? Although the 2008 global 
recession ended years ago, some trends from those years may have been respon￾sible. Some people who had long been unemployed left the workforce alto￾gether.128 At the same time, others have cobbled together several part-time 
jobs129 or pivoted to on-demand work.130 Other researchers point to more 
distal sources: the dissipation of permanent employment following the Great 
Depression, layoffs of blue-collar workers in the 1970s, or the mass outsourc￾ing of jobs in the 1980s and 1990s stemming from globalization.131 Since then, 
some younger, educated workers have opted to embrace the entrepreneurial 
spirit and start their own companies, many of which have flourished in their 
own right.132 Others have entered the Gig Economy after falling into the 
“in-between”—the spaces betwixt organizations, work roles, and career paths

resulting from a century’s worth of watershed employment crises (e.g., the 
Great Depression, the Great Recession, COVID-19).133 As OB students, we can 
investigate how gig workers navigate the new economy, how their contributions 
and employment affect organizational outcomes, and what the world can do to 
address the unique challenges that gig workers face.

Coming Attractions: Developing 
an OB Model
1-6 Compare the three levels 
of analysis in this text’s OB 
model.
We conclude this chapter by presenting a general model that defines the field 
of OB and stakes out its parameters, concepts, and relationships. By studying 
the model, you will have a good picture of how the topics in this text can inform 
your approach to management issues and opportunities.
An Overview
A model is an abstraction of reality, a simplified representation of some real-world 
phenomenon. Exhibit 1-5 presents the skeleton of our OB model. It proposes 
three types of variables (inputs, processes, and outcomes) at three levels of 
analysis (individual, group, and organizational). In the chapters to follow, we 
will proceed from the individual level (Chapters 2 through 8) to group behavior 
(Chapters 9 through 14) to the organizational system (Chapters 15 through 18). 
The model illustrates that inputs lead to processes, which lead to outcomes; we 
will discuss these interrelationships at each level of analysis. Notice that the model 
also shows that outcomes can influence inputs in the future, highlighting the 
broad-reaching effect that OB initiatives can have on an organization’s future.
Inputs
Inputs are variables like personality, group structure, and organizational cul￾ture that lead to processes. These variables set the stage for what will occur in 
an organization later. Many are determined in advance of the employment 
model An abstraction of reality, a 
simplified representation of some 
real-world phenomenon.
inputs Variables like personality, group 
structure, and organizational culture that 
lead to processes.
OB During Crises
When the United States economy plunged into a deep and prolonged reces￾sion in 2008, virtually all other large economies worldwide followed suit. 
Layoffs and job losses were widespread, and those who survived the ax were 
often asked to accept pay cuts. When times are bad, as they were during the 
recession, managers are on the frontlines with employees. They face difficult 
decisions in which they ask employees to make do with less (or to resign 
from their jobs), and these employees are already saddled with worry about 
their futures. The difference between good and bad management can be the 
difference between profit and loss or ultimately between business survival 
and failure. Managing employees well when times are tough is just as hard 
as when times are good, if not harder. In good times, understanding how to 
reward, satisfy, and retain employees is at a premium. In bad times, issues like 
stress, decision making, and coping come to the forefront.
Today, the COVID-19 pandemic has once again highlighted the role that workers, 
managers, and organizations play during times of crisis. The question does not merely 
concern “what happens” during a crisis but, more importantly, how can knowledge 
about workplace behavior inform our decision-making during crises. The pandemic 
has vaulted the globe into a new state of crisis, and there are implications for virtually 
every core topic in OB.134 Research has examined the most apparent effects of the 
crisis (i.e., COVID-19’s impact on remote work, work–family conflict, and health and 
safety climates)135 to its subtler effects (i.e., COVID-19’s impact on worker “sudden 
hero” status and even the implications of pet ownership for isolated remote work￾ers).136 Throughout the text, we highlight how OB has helped contribute to our 
understanding of the working world in times of crisis. We also describe how work￾ers and managers can leverage what we know to make the workplace a better place 
when times get tough.

relationship. For example, individual characteristics, personality, and values are 
shaped by a combination of an individual’s genetic inheritance and childhood 
environment. Group structure, roles, and team responsibilities are typically 
assigned immediately before or after a group is formed. Organizational struc￾ture and culture are usually the results of years of development and change as 
the organization adapts to its environment and builds up customs and norms.
Processes
If inputs are like the nouns in OB, processes are like the verbs. Processes are 
actions that individuals, groups, and organizations engage in as a result of 
inputs and that lead to certain outcomes. At the individual level, processes 
include emotions and moods, motivation, perception, and decision making. At 
the group level, they include communication, leadership, power and politics, 
and conflict and negotiation. At the organizational level, processes include HR 
management and change practices.
Outcomes
Outcomes are the key variables that you want to explain or predict and that are 
affected by other variables. What are the primary outcomes in OB? Scholars 
have emphasized individual-level outcomes, such as attitudes and stress, task 
performance, citizenship behavior, and withdrawal behavior. At the group level, 
cohesion and functioning are the dependent variables. At the organizational 
level, we look at overall productivity and survival. Because these outcomes will 
be covered in all the chapters, we will briefly discuss each here so you can under￾stand the goal of OB.
Attitudes and Stress Employee attitudes are the evaluations that employees 
make, ranging from positive to negative, about objects, people, or events. For 
example, the statement “My job is great” is a positive job attitude, and “My job 
is boring and tedious” is a negative job attitude. Stress is a psychological process 
that occurs in response to environmental pressures.

M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 61 13/12/22 1:55 AM62 PART 1 Introduction
Some people might think influencing employee attitudes and stress is purely 
soft stuff, but as you will learn, attitudes often have behavioral consequences 
that relate directly to how well you do your job. The belief that satisfied employ￾ees are more productive than dissatisfied employees has been a fundamental 
tenet among managers for years, though only now has research begun to sup￾port it.137 Ample evidence shows that employees who are more satisfied and 
treated fairly are more willing to engage in the above-and-beyond citizenship 
behavior so vital in the contemporary business environment.138
Job Performance The total value of your contributions to an organization 
through your behaviors reflects your level of job performance over a period of 
time.
139 For example, an employee at a sub shop during a typical workday shows 
up on time, clocks in using the appropriate procedures, cleans and disinfects 
surfaces, makes and toasts made-to-order sandwiches, resolves customer com￾plaints, and completes all closing activities to ensure the ingredients stay fresh. 
These behaviors provide value to an organization during a typical workday.
A significant component of one’s job performance is task performance, or how 
well a worker accomplishes the specific tasks that comprise their job or their 
responsibilities to the organization that employs them.140 If we think about the 
job of a factory worker, task performance could be measured by the number 
and quality of products produced in an hour. The task performance of a teacher 
could be the level of education that students obtain. The task performance of 
consultants might be the timeliness and quality of the client’s presentations.
All these types of performance relate to a job’s core duties and responsi￾bilities. They are often directly related to the functions listed on a formal job 
description. However, job performance goes beyond merely completing core 
tasks—it can also involve effectively communicating with others; demonstrat￾ing initiative, effort, and persistence; and leading or facilitating your team￾mates’ performance, as either a formal supervisor or an informal teammate.141
Obviously, job performance is the most essential human output contributing to 
organizational effectiveness. In every chapter, we devote considerable time to 
detailing how task performance is affected by the topic in question.
Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) The discretionary behavior that is 
not part of an employee’s formal job requirements and contributes to the work￾place’s psychological and social environment is called organizational citizenship 
behavior (OCB), or simply citizenship behavior. Successful organizations have 
employees who do more than their usual job duties—who provide performance 
beyond expectations. In today’s dynamic workplace, where tasks are increasingly 
performed by teams and where flexibility is critical, employees who engage in 
good citizenship behaviors help others on their team, volunteer for extra work, 
avoid unnecessary conflicts, respect the spirit as well as the letter of rules and 
regulations, and gracefully tolerate occasional work-related impositions and 
nuisances.
Organizations want and need employees who will do things that are not in 
any job description. Evidence indicates organizations that have such employees 
outperform those that do not.142 As a result, OB is concerned with citizenship 
behavior as an outcome variable.
Withdrawal Behavior We have already mentioned behavior that goes above 
and beyond task requirements, but what about behavior that in some way is 
below task requirements? Withdrawal behavior is the set of actions that employ￾ees take to separate themselves from the organization. There are many forms 
of withdrawal, ranging from showing up late or failing to attend meetings to 
job performance The total value of a

organizational citizenship behavior 
(OCB) Discretionary behavior that 
contributes to the psychological and social 
environment of the workplace.
withdrawal behavior The set of actions 
employees take to separate themselves from 
the organization.

absenteeism and turnover. Some of these may also be classified as unethical 
behaviors (discussed earlier in the chapter). As some examples, purposely show￾ing up late to meetings and shirking your responsibilities because you do not 
feel like working (even though you have a responsibility to your employer to act 
according to your contract or work agreement) are unethical.
Employee withdrawal can have a very negative effect on an organization. 
The cost of employee turnover alone has been estimated to run into the thou￾sands of dollars, even for entry-level positions. Consider for a moment that the 
annual turnover rate was 26.3 percent and the cost of replacing each employee 
ranged from one-half to two-times their salary in 2017. As such, the average cost 
to a one-hundred-person organization for a $50,000 salary worker could range 
from $660,000 to $2.6 million in 2017.143 Absenteeism also costs organizations 
significant amounts of money and time every year. For instance, a recent sur￾vey found the average direct cost to United States employers of unscheduled 
absences is 6.7  percent of payroll.144 Research also suggests that productivity 
losses linked to absenteeism translate to $225.8 billion for employers (roughly 
$1,685 per employee).145
It is difficult for an organization to operate smoothly and attain its objectives 
if employees fail to report to their jobs. The workflow is disrupted, and impor￾tant decisions may be delayed. In organizations that rely heavily on assembly-line 
production, absenteeism can drastically reduce output quality or even shut down 
the facility. Levels of absenteeism beyond the normal range directly impact any 
organization’s effectiveness and efficiency. A high turnover rate can also dis￾rupt an organization’s efficiency when knowledgeable and experienced person￾nel leave and replacements must be found. Research indicates that, in general, 
turnover is significantly harmful to organizational performance.146
All organizations have some turnover, of course. Turnover varies significantly 
by country and, in part, reflects the economy of that country. In 2019, turn￾over was at an all-time high since 2001, increasing from 66.2 million in 2018 to 
67.9 million in 2019.147 Of course, this was before COVID-19, which affected the 
state of turnover in the United States, with voluntary separations decreasing and 
involuntary separations increasing during that period.148 Returning to 2019, 
were the turnover levels that year good or bad? To answer that question, we

Employees working together as a 
team. Successful team performance 
depends on team inputs and pro￾cesses. Team inputs include clearly 
establishing group structure, group 
roles, and team responsibilities. 
Team processes include effective 
leadership and communication, 
successful navigation of power and 
political issues, and the constructive 
handling of conflict.
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 63 13/12/22 1:55 AM64 PART 1 Introduction
need to know why there is turnover. Turnover includes voluntary terminations 
by the employee (quitting), involuntary terminations by the employer without 
cause (layoffs and discharges), and other separations, including involuntary 
terminations with cause (firing). A substantial degree of turnover in 2019 was 
voluntary—42.1 million of the 67.9 million (roughly 62 percent)—also a record 
high since 2001.149 Therefore, a staggering two-thirds of turnover that year was 
due to employees voluntarily quitting their jobs.
While high turnover often impairs an organization’s ability to achieve 
its goals, quitting is not all bad. United States former Federal Reserve 
Chairwoman Janet Yellen has discussed the positive aspects of turnover for 
the economy: People quit because they are optimistic about their outside 
prospects.150 If the “right” people are leaving—the poorer performers—quits 
can be positive for an organization. They can create opportunities to replace 
underperforming individuals with those higher in skill or motivation, open 
up increased opportunities for promotions, and bring new and fresh ideas to 
the organization. In today’s changing world of work, reasonable employee￾initiated turnover levels improve organizational flexibility and employee 
independence. They can also lessen the need for management-initiated lay￾offs. While it is appropriate to conclude that high turnover often indicates 
high employee withdrawal (and thus hurts organizational performance), 
zero turnover is not necessarily the goal. It is also crucial for organizations to 
assess which employees are leaving and why.
So why do employees withdraw from work through counterproductive 
behaviors or quitting? As we will show later in the text, reasons include negative 
job attitudes, emotions, moods, and negative interactions with coworkers and 
supervisors.
Team Performance Although many outcomes in our model can be thought of 
as involving individuals, some relate to the way groups and teams operate. Team 
performance refers to the quantity and quality of a team’s work output. Similar 
to how a sports team’s performance is more than the sum of individual players’ 
performance, group functioning in work organizations is more than the sum of 
individual task performances.
What does it mean to say that a team is performing effectively? In some orga￾nizations, an effective team stays focused on a core task and achieves its ends as 
specified. Other organizations look for teams that can work together collabora￾tively to provide excellent customer service. Still others put more of a premium 
on creativity and the flexibility to adapt to changing situations. In each case, 
different activities will be required to get the most from the team.
Productivity The highest level of analysis in OB is the organization. An orga￾nization is productive if it achieves its goals by transforming inputs into outputs 
at the lowest cost. Thus, productivity requires both effectiveness and efficiency.
A hospital is effective when it meets the needs of its clientele successfully. It is effi￾cient when it can do so at a low cost. If a hospital manages to achieve higher output 
from its present staff by reducing the average number of days a patient is confined 
to a bed or increasing the number of staff–patient contacts per day, we say the 
hospital has gained productive efficiency. A business firm is effective when it attains 
its sales or market share goals, but its productivity also depends on achieving those 
goals efficiently. Popular organizational efficiency measures include return on 
investment, profit per dollar of sales, and output per hour of labor.
Organizations in the service industry must include customer needs and 
requirements in assessing their effectiveness. Why? Because a direct chain 
of cause and effect runs from employee attitudes and behavior to customer 
attitudes and profitability. For example, a recent study of over 50,000 online 
team performance The quantity and quality 
of a team’s work output.
productivity The combination of the 
effectiveness and efficiency of an 
organization.
effectiveness The degree to which an 
organization meets the needs of its clientele 
or customers.
efficiency The degree to which an 
organization can achieve its ends at a 
low cost.

TripAdvisor reviews and nearly 8,000 managerial responses suggests that when 
managers personally respond to online reviews, financial performance (e.g., 
revenue per available room) increases. 152
Survival The final outcome we will consider is organizational survival , which 
is simply evidence that the organization can exist and grow over the long term. 
The survival of an organization depends not just on how productive the organi￾zation is but also on how well it fits its environment. A company that is very pro￾ductive in making goods and services of little value to the market is unlikely to 
survive for long. So survival relies on perceiving the market successfully, making 
good decisions about how and when to pursue opportunities, and successfully 
managing change to adapt to new business conditions.

an organization can exist and grow over the 
long term. 
 An Ethical Choice 
 What Should You Do If Your Values Do Not Align 
with Your Company’s? 
So, you find yourself at work 
listening to your coworkers 
expressing values and beliefs 
radically different from your own. 
You decide not to say anything and 
sometimes even pretend you agree 
with their opinions. Although you are 
suppressing your thoughts, you have 
learned that it is best to leave your 
personal views outside the office. You 
would rather not risk your coworkers 
viewing you differently or, worse, jeop￾ardizing your position. 
 The risk of potentially losing your 
job or being demoted may seem to 
outweigh the discomfort of conceal￾ing your actual values and beliefs. 
However, merely hiding or suppress￾ing your values and opinions does not 
make them go away. Research indi￾cates that inauthentically conforming 
to organizational values (i.e., a “facade 
of conformity”) can impact a worker’s 
attachment to their organization in the 
long run. Ultimately, job insecurity (a 
concern that one may be vulnerable to 
losing their job common during organi￾zational crises) worsens the situation. 
During crises, workers are more likely 
to feign agreement with their cowork￾ers and the values established by their 
organizations—even when they do 
not align with their own. In particular, 
young workers are more prone to these 
“facades of conformity” when faced 
with job insecurity. 
 Furthermore, research signals that 
inauthenticity in the workplace can 
lead individuals to engage in more 
unethical behavior than when indi￾viduals have greater identity integra￾tion. Value incongruence is positively 
related to ego depletion, or the loss 
of self-control, which ultimately harms 
work performance or leads to unethi￾cal behavior. Compatibility between 
one’s professional and nonprofes￾sional identities allows employees to 
bring their whole selves to work, ben￾efiting organizations by reducing the 
risk of unethical behavior. 
 Here are some recommendations if 
you find yourself in a situation where 
your values are incongruent with your 
employer’s: 
1. Identify your values. Focus on three 
to five values that are most impor￾tant to who you want to be as a per￾son. This action will help you clarify 
what is important to you. 
2. Develop a list of questions directed 
at your (or a potential) employer. 
 These should be open-ended 
questions that will help you deter￾mine which values the company 
espouses. You can contemplate 
how your employer would respond, 
review your employers’ mission or 
value statements, or even infor￾mally ask around your work group. 
It is also a good idea when inter￾viewing with a new job to ask your 
interviewer this question or—even 
better—to do some fact-finding 
before the interview to find out 
yourself to ask informed follow-up 
questions. 
3. Seek out jobs and work arrange￾ments that are consistent with 
your authentic self. Research dem￾onstrates that prioritizing consis￾tency between your values and your 
employer’s values will make it less 
likely that you choose to leave or 
engage in withdrawal behaviors. 
However, this does not just go for 
the relationship between you and 
your organization. For instance, it 
may be that your values do not align 
with your work group, your team, or 
your supervisor. Or it may be that 
the values portrayed on paper do 
not match what the organization 
actually does. In either case, a val￾ues mismatch is very difficult to 
change. It can be detrimental to 
your performance and well-being. 
In contrast, a values match often 
provides the right foundation for 
you to flourish and excel in your job, 
career, and organization. 151

Having reviewed the input, process, and outcome model, we will change the 
figure slightly by grouping topics based on whether we study them at the indi￾vidual, group, or organizational level. As you can see in Exhibit 1-6, we deal with 
inputs, processes, and outcomes at all three levels of analysis, but we group the 
chapters as shown here to correspond with the typical ways research has been 
done in these areas. For example, it is easier to understand one unified presen￾tation about how personality leads to motivation, which leads to performance, 
than to jump around levels of analysis. Each level builds on the one that pre￾cedes it, so after going through them in sequence, you will have a good idea of 
how the human side of organizations functions.

Employability Skills
1-7 Describe the key 
employability skills gained 
from studying OB that are 
applicable to other majors 
or future careers.
Challenges relevant to OB can be found in just about every business function, 
from finance and accounting to management and marketing. Without a doubt, 
at some point in your career, you will come across an issue that hinges to no 
small degree on people’s behavior in organizations. A review of the significant 
challenges that most businesses face reveals that OB is an essential piece of the 
puzzle in solving many organizational problems. For instance, these problems 
may involve managing integrity/social responsibility, resource management, 
competition among businesses, bolstering customer and employee loyalty, 
reducing uncertainty, complying with government regulation, managing risks, 
and finding the right staff—all while growing revenue and increasing profit.153
But OB is not relevant to business majors only; it is vital for all students, no 
matter what their majors are. At first glance, for example, it might not seem as if a 
university student with a microbiology degree would have any need to take an OB 
class. But what happens after that student graduates? Wouldn’t knowledge of OB 
principles and concepts help them apply to and be successful at a job as a biology 
technician with Battelle? What about a graduate with a nursing degree working 
at the Mayo Clinic? A computer science graduate who is about to begin work with 
Cisco? OB principles matter for students of all majors. They can help increase 
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 66 13/12/22 1:55 AMWhat Is Organizational Behavior? CHAPTER 1 67
employability as well as interpersonal skills in the workplace. These skills can help 
you become successful in your classes as you interact with other students and your 
professors! Clearly, the knowledge of OB concepts such as stress management, 
change, attitudes, emotions, and motivation, among others, can help you navi￾gate your interactions with your classmates as you continue to learn.
People, along with their behaviors, differences, attitudes, emotions, moods, 
personalities, values, intentions, thoughts, and motivations, are inextricably 
linked to life in the workplace. As professor Benjamin Schneider notes, “The 
people make the place.”154 These employees interact and communicate with 
one another within and across work groups, departments, teams, and organiza￾tions to help accomplish the organization’s goals. Leaders within these organiza￾tions (along with the employees themselves) seek to effect change, establish an 
organizational culture, and set policies and procedures: processes that inevita￾bly involve leadership, politicking, conflict, and negotiation. Given OB’s perva￾siveness in organizational life, entry-level employees and working professionals 
would benefit from having solid foundational skills in OB, such as communica￾tion, collaboration, critical thinking, problem solving, social responsibility, and 
knowledge application and analysis.
This section explores the career employability skills that a course in OB can help 
expand for those who select any major—from engineering to political science.
Employability Skills That Apply Across Majors
Throughout this text, you will learn and practice many skills that hiring manag￾ers identify as crucial to success in various business settings, including small and 
large firms, nonprofit organizations, and public service. These skills will also be 
useful if you plan to start your own business, for example:
• Critical thinking & creativity involve purposeful and goal-directed thinking 
used to define and solve problems, to make decisions, or to form judgments 
related to a particular situation. The goal of this process is to produce novel 
and useful ideas. It involves cognitive, metacognitive, and dispositional 
components that may be applied differently in specific contexts.
• Communication is defined as effective use of oral, written, and nonverbal 
communication skills for multiple purposes (e.g., to inform, instruct, mo￾tivate, persuade, and share ideas); effective listening; using technology to 
communicate; and being able to evaluate the effectiveness of communica￾tion efforts—all within diverse contexts.
• Collaboration is a skill in which individuals can actively work together on a 
task, constructing meaning and knowledge as a group through dialogue 
and negotiation that results in a final product reflective of their joint, in￾terdependent actions.
• Self-management is defined as the ability to intentionally and strategically 
manage one’s behavior, effort, and emotions in the pursuit of goals. It 
involves building skill in self-control, self-monitoring, and self-regulation.
• Social responsibility includes skills related to both business ethics and cor￾porate social responsibility. Business ethics includes sets of guiding prin￾ciples that influence the way individuals and organizations behave within 
the society that they operate in. Corporate social responsibility is a form 
of ethical behavior that requires that organizations understand, identify, 
and eliminate unethical economic, environmental, and social behaviors.
• Leadership, as described in depth in the corresponding chapter, focuses on 
the ability or skill to influence a group toward the achievement of a vision or 
set of goals. Leadership involves learning to establish a vision, modifying one’s 
style or approach to meet particular goals, building productive and meaning￾ful relationships with followers, and engaging in influence behaviors.
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 67 13/12/22 1:55 AM68 PART 1 Introduction
• Career management involves developing an understanding of the 
“ real-world” employment context along with the professional acumen 
needed to successfully transition between jobs and careers. This involves 
exploring different careers, impression management and personal brand￾ing, networking skills, and navigating the labor market. 
 Each of the text chapters starts with what we refer to as the employability 
skills matrix (ESM). As you can see in the table below, this matrix links the seven 
employability skills that were just defined with unique features in each chapter, 
including Myth or Science?, An Ethical Choice, Point/Counterpoint, Toward a 
Better World, Experiential Exercise, Ethical Dilemma, and the Case Incident. 
Within these sections, you will be primed to think critically and creatively to 
consider special cases and concepts. You will also learn how to improve your 
self-management, collaboration, and communication skills by learning what you 
might do or say in these given situations to positively and effectively navigate the 
work world. You will be confronted with ethical dilemmas and opportunities in 
which you will consider the ethics of particular behaviors in the workplace and 
contemplate how organizations can contribute to the good of society. In many 
instances, you will take on the role of a manager or leader and weigh particular 
actions to solve leadership problems. Lastly, you will encounter real career or 
job search situations in which you will be presented with a problem or dilemma 
that you must navigate properly. We recommend that you review and evaluate 
the ESM in advance of reading the chapter to have a better idea of the skills 
you will be developing from each section. All seven of these skills are critical 
to success in careers relevant to OB and other majors alike. In the chapters to 
come, you will engage in various activities and become exposed to several cases 
in which you will be developing these skills.

Summary
Managers and workers alike need to understand behavior in organizations 
and develop the skills required to be effective in their jobs. OB investigates 
the impact that individuals, groups, and structure have on behavior within 
an organization. It applies that knowledge to make organizations work more 
effectively. OB covers many topics that have important implications for nearly 
all aspects of working life and at all levels of the organization, from gig work￾ers to CEOs. Heavily influenced by major behavioral science disciplines, OB 
applies systematic study to what goes on within organizations. As a result of 
this systematic study, OB researchers derive evidence-based practices and 
the contingencies for when they are most and less likely to be successful. 
Employees and managers can use them to make informed decisions. Today, 
this often involves leveraging large amounts of data to understand organiza￾tional phenomena better—a practice that has been dramatically enhanced by 
the artificial intelligence revolution. Overall, OB is a system of inputs, pro￾cesses, and outputs of importance to organizations. Researchers examine the 
links in this chain to determine how organizational phenomena unfold. This 
system changes in response to the environment; however, current opportuni￾ties and challenges (i.e., COVID-19, the Gig Economy) will no doubt be influ￾encing our understanding of behavior in the workplace for decades to come. 
At the end of the line, organizations and the people who “make” them can 
use these evidence-based practices to be more productive, efficient, happier, 
and healthier. A knowledge of OB can benefit you because it can help you de￾velop employability skills, which you can use regardless of your background 
and which can aid you in your future career.
Implications for Managers
● Resist the inclination to rely on generalizations; some provide useful 
insights into human behavior, but many are erroneous.
● A nuanced understanding of the situation is often needed to reach the 
best solutions. Try to understand the people involved and the context. 
From there, try and figure out what works, what does not work, and any 
contingencies that qualify these practices.
● Strive for evidence-based solutions to problems and evaluate your hunches 
and intuition critically.
● Work on your people skills to better interact with peers, work on teams 
more effectively, and both lead and manage your followers to do great 
things.
● Improve your technical skills and conceptual skills through training, 
development, and staying current with OB trends affecting the world of 
work, like the Gig Economy, big data, and AI.
● OB can be important for many relevant outcomes such as worker satisfac￾tion. But it also contributes to significant organizational outcomes that can 
affect organizational financial performance, such as labor productivity and 
turnover reduction.
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 69 13/12/22 1:55 AM70 PART 1 Introduction
 Business Books: Facts? Or Just Fads? 
POINT 
C
onduct a quick search on Amazon and you will find a wide se￾lection of management books whose titles tell us the topics we 
apparently need to know about: 
● Drive to Thrive (Bajaj, 2020) 
● The Savage Leader: 13 Principles to Become a 
Better Leader from the Inside Out (Reinke, 2021) 
● The First-Time Manager (McCormick, 2018) 
● The Making of a Manager: What to Do When 
Everyone Looks to You (Zhuo, 2019) American Crisis: 
Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic
(Cuomo, 2020) 
● How to Lead When You’re Not in Charge (Scroggins, 
2017) 
● Radical Candor (Scott, 2017) 
● Leadershift (Maxwell, 2019) 
● Excellence Wins (Schulze, 2019) 
 Popular books on OB often have cute titles and are fun to read, but 
they make the job of managing people seem like it is just a matter of 
having a good slogan and five easy steps. If you dig into the texts, you 
will find that most are based on the author’s opinions rather than sub￾stantive research. Most become popular in part because people pri￾marily agree with the opinions they are reading and enjoy the author’s 
writing style. Often, the writers are presentation speakers or consul￾tants whose real business is delivering ideas to you. When the author 
is a veteran from the business world, it is doubtful that one person’s 
experience translates into an effective management practice for ev￾eryone. So why do we base our management philosophies on these 
books when, with a little effort, we can access knowledge produced by 
thousands of scientific studies on human behavior in organizations? 
 OB is a complex subject. Few if any simple statements about 
human behavior are generalizable to all people in all situations. 
Would you try to apply leadership insights you got from a book about 
Star Wars or Breaking Bad to managing software engineers in the 
twenty-first century? Surely not. Neither should we try to apply leader￾ship insights that are not based on research about the type of work￾places in which we function. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 P
eople want to know about management—the good, the bad, 
and the ugly. People who have experience or high interest write 
about the topics that interest readers, and publishers put out 
the best of these texts. When books become popular, we know people 
are learning from them and finding good results by applying the au￾thor’s management ideas. Texts like these can provide people with the 
secrets to management that others have worked out through experi￾ence. Isn’t it better to learn about management from people in the 
trenches instead of academia’s latest obscure references? Many of 
the most important insights we gain in life are not necessarily the 
product of careful empirical research studies. 
 Unhelpful management guides sometimes get published, and 
once in a while, they become popular. But do they outnumber the 
esoteric research studies published in scholarly journal articles every 
year? Far from it, sometimes it seems that there are thousands of 
scholarly journal articles for every popular business text. Many of 
these articles can hardly be read by individuals in the workplace. They 
are buried in academic libraries, riddled with strange acronyms and 
insider terms, and light on practical application. Often they apply to 
specific management scenarios, so they are even less generalizable. 
For example, a few recent management and OB studies were pub￾lished with the following titles: 
● “Transferring Management Practices to China: A Bourdieusian 
Critique of Ethnocentricity” (Siebers, Kamoche, & Li, 2015) 
● “Cross-Cultural Perceptions of Clan Control in Korean 
Multinational Companies: A Conceptual Investigation of 
Employees’ Fairness Monitoring Based on Cultural Values” 
(Yang, 2015) 
● “The Resistible Rise of Bayesian Thinking in Management: 
Historical Lessons from Decision Analysis” (Cabantous & 
Gond, 2015) 
● “A Model of Rhetorical Legitimation: The Structure of 
Communication and Cognition Underlying Institutional 
Maintenance and Change” (Harmon, Green, & Goodnight, 2016) 
 We do not mean to poke fun at these studies, but our point is that 
all ways of creating knowledge can be criticized. If business books are 
sometimes light reading, academic articles can be esoteric and even 
less relevant. Popular books can add to our understanding of how 
people work and how to manage them best. We should not assume 
they are not of value. And while there is no one right way to learn 
the science and art of managing people in organizations, the most 
enlightened managers gather insights from multiple sources. These 
might include their own experience, research findings, observations of 
others, and, yes, the popular business press. Authors and academics 
have an essential role to play, and it is not fair to condemn business 
books with catchy titles.

EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Managing Remote Teams
Guava is a music streaming service located in Silicon Valley 
that is steadily growing (with roughly 500 employees cur￾rently). Guava has plans to hire many new employees 
within the coming year. The CEO, Lennox Reynolds, has a 
vision to permanently transition roughly half of the exist￾ing employees to remote work and potentially hire addi￾tional remote workers. Reynolds also wants the company 
to develop a flatter structure. Rather than have depart￾ments organized by traditional functions like engineering 
or marketing, employees would work on project teams 
and have greater autonomy. Reynolds believes this will 
allow creativity and innovation to thrive (helping Guava 
develop a competitive advantage). Reynolds thinks a rigid 
traditional structure restricts employees and stifles creativ￾ity and innovation. Rather than having a single designated 
leader, teams will allow individuals to emerge as leaders.
However, despite Reynolds’ grand plans, most of the 
other executives at Guava raise issues with this vision and 
find it too ambitious. Lennox believes her plan will save 
the company money as it will no longer need to build 
or maintain offices to accommodate employees. She is 
also confident that employees will find this arrangement 
favorable, resulting in better employee retention. Remote 
work would require fewer employees to relocate to more 
expensive areas, promote work–life balance, and elimi￾nate wasted time employees spend commuting.
Despite Lennox outlining the potential benefits of 
remote work, the other executives pointed out several 
possible issues. These include the challenge of setting 
boundaries between work and home life, ensuring that 
employees are productive, providing mentorship and 
development for newer employees, and developing a new 
structure for making important decisions. Furthermore, 
all employees were surveyed to assess whether they would 
choose to work remotely full-time or part-time if given 
the option. Thirty percent of existing employees said 
they were very interested in working remotely full-time. 
Another 20 percent said they were somewhat interested. 
While some employees have expressed strong preferences 
for working remotely, other employees and many supervi￾sors have various concerns. Guava needs to decide soon 
regarding its remote work policy. The decision will impact 
whether the company chooses to scale back office space 
and require significant structural changes.
Reynolds believes it is extremely promising that roughly 
50 percent of employees are interested in working remotely. 
Reynolds recognizes that employees have concerns and 
that Guava would likely face obstacles when implementing 
the new plan to alter its structure. As a result, she sends 
an e-mail outlining potential changes to address remote 
work concerns to the leadership team. Reynolds plans to 
hold a meeting with a few of the executives to discuss her 
proposed changes, including how employees would be 
approved to work remotely, the development of enhanced 
employee training, and the use of employee monitoring 
software to ensure that employees remain productive.
After reading the scenario, form a group with four 
other students. One individual should take on the role of 
the CEO, Lennox Reynolds. At the same time, the other 
group members will assume the role of executives at the 
company. During your meeting, you must answer the fol￾lowing questions.

ETHICAL DILEMMA Credit Where Credit Is Due
You are preparing for the weekly team meeting, during 
which each team member shares a new idea that they 
have been working on that week. One idea in particular 
receives very positive feedback. The idea sticks with you as 
incredibly innovative, and you remark to your coworker, 
Aiden, “Wasn’t that a great idea that Alex shared?”
You are surprised to see that Aiden, who is almost al￾ways in a good mood, has a disgruntled look on his face. 
“I thought so too when I was researching and preparing 
to present the idea to the team myself,” Aiden responds.
“Well, I have to say I’m surprised Alex would do some￾thing like that. What do you plan to do then?” you ask. 
You are not quite sure what you would do in this situation 
either. Although your company is a proponent of collabo￾ration, it is also a proponent of recognizing team mem￾bers’ unique contributions.
Alex has a conflicted look on his face and pauses a mo￾ment. “I suppose since I hadn’t presented the idea to the 
team yet, it is not technically my idea. On the other hand, 
I put a lot of work into researching the idea, and Alex 
knew this because I shared it with her. I didn’t think that 
she would completely take the idea as her own. But Alex 
and I work together frequently. I do not want to create 
an uncomfortable situation.” Finally, after a long pause, 
Aiden says more confidently, “I’m not going to say any￾thing. I think I was overacting.”
“Well, it is your decision, I suppose,” you hesitantly re￾spond as Aiden is already making his way back to his desk.
Questions
1-12. What, if any, are the ethical issues in play in this 
situation?
1-13. Do you agree with how your coworker plans to 
handle the situation? Why or why not?
1-14. What do you think would be the ideal decision in 
this situation, and why? Does the ideal decision 
differ from what your coworker proposes?
1-15. What do you think will be the consequences of 
your coworker’s actions?
1-16. How do motivation and intention play a role for 
both you and your coworker?
CASE INCIDENT Work–Life Balance at R.G. & Company
Tatum is a consultant at R.G. & Company (R.G.), a global 
consulting firm. She has enjoyed the past few years work￾ing at the company. As an ambitious person, she has been 
focusing on her long-term goal of advancing within the 
company. Furthermore, Tatum has always been passionate 
about her work and could not imagine working anywhere 
else. Nonetheless, working at R.G. as a mother of a young 
child has not been without its challenges. The company 
does offer some flexibility in terms of when she is in the 
office. As long as she completes her work, her supervisors 
usually do not care if she leaves early or works from home 
when her daughter is sick.
Although Tatum may work long hours at home, she 
knows that she is not perceived the same way as those 
who stay late working at the office. In her office, it seems 
like everyone expects you to stay late to demonstrate your 
dedication and to have any chance of being promoted. 
If Tatum wants a promotion, she believes she needs to 
make herself stand out among all the company’s qualified 
individuals.
R.G. has policies to accommodate those with family re￾sponsibilities. But, in practice, Tatum knows that few em￾ployees take advantage of them. For example, Tatum was 
a little surprised at how quickly her supervisor, Kennedy, 
returned to the office after having a child. However, 
Kennedy was much admired at R.G. and was held up as an 
example that it was possible to have it all—to be a success￾ful working mother. The alternative was for Tatum to tran￾sition to working part-time or switch to a less demanding 
role. Unfortunately, these alternatives would essentially 
mean putting aside her goal of advancement.
On the other hand, she had heard others make com￾ments when another woman who had two younger chil￾dren stayed late at the office. Some would say, “Why don’t 
M01_ROBB0025_19_GE_C01.indd 72 13/12/22 1:55 AMWhat Is Organizational Behavior? CHAPTER 1 73
you get home to your kids?” or “Don’t your kids miss 
you?” To Tatum, it felt like a constant balancing act be￾tween trying to be an exemplary employee and ensuring 
she was not perceived to be a neglectful mother.
One aspect that had initially drawn Tatum to this or￾ganization was the “accommodations” (i.e., flexible work 
hours, fewer responsibilities, and part-time hours), partic￾ularly for women. However, she now felt almost guilty in 
thinking that these “accommodations” were more likely 
to hurt than help her professionally. Thankfully, her part￾ner earned enough to comfortably support their family 
if Tatum decided to work fewer hours or transition roles. 
Still, Tatum was having trouble coming to terms with the 
possibility of not achieving her professional goals.
Questions
1-17. Do you believe the accommodations offered by 
Tatum’s firm are effective in helping individuals 
balance work and family lives? Why or why not?
1-18. Are there any practices or policies that the orga￾nization could implement to allow for greater 
work–life balance?
1-19. Are there any actions Tatum could take to 
achieve both her professional goals and work–life 
balance?
1-20. How important do you believe work–life balance 
is for job satisfaction and career success?155

 A LACK OF DIVERSITY IN THE TECH INDUSTRY 
The tech industry has been notorious for failing on the diversity and 
inclusion front. Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft may be the 
biggest technology companies across the world, yet the diversity reports 
they have posted for the past five years consistently present the same 
picture, an industry dominated by White and Asian men. 
 There has been some progress since 2014. Facebook, for instance, says 
the percentage of its female employees globally has increased from 15 to 23 
percent. However, ethnic diversity remains low. Over the same time period, 
the proportion of U.S. technical employees at Google and Microsoft who 
are African American or Latinx rose by only about 1 percent. The share of 
African American technical workers at Apple is 6 percent, less than half the 
13 percent proportion of African Americans in the U.S. population. Ageism 
also continues to be a challenge; when tech workers hit 45, their job offers 
drop and salaries start to fall. 
 In the United Kingdom too, data on diversity in the tech industry is 
disappointing, lagging far behind the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 
(FTSE 100) Index. About 8.5 percent of senior executives in technology are 
from a minority background, while women make up just 12.6 percent of board 
members in the sector, compared with the 30 percent female representation 
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 75 13/12/22 1:59 AM76 PART 2 The Individual
achieved by FTSE 100 businesses. The picture is similar across Europe. 
According to the 2019 State of European Tech Report, there was a record 
investment of about €30 billion in the industry across the continent, yet 92 
percent of the investment went to all-male founding teams, and funding to all￾female teams actually dropped. Of the hundreds of founders that responded 
to the survey, 84 percent self-identify as White, and just 0.9 percent are of 
African descent. And 82 percent of founders are university educated, as 
compared to the 35 percent of people across Europe.
The status quo is particularly troubling because of how technology 
now affects every sector, from transport, to finance, to the government, to 
health care. If only today’s tech-literate workers can access these growing 
employment opportunities, swaths of the general population will be left 
behind. The products and services they make will be skewed too. The lack 
of inclusion affects the design of the goods and services that the industry 
creates. For instance, voice recognition initially did not respond to women 
because the designers who tested the products were male. Facial recognition 
is notoriously poor at recognizing darker and female faces, again partly 
because of biased training data. A more diverse workforce will lead to better 
products that can address a wider range of customers, who may include 
people from different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds as well as the 
elderly and the disabled.1
Despite decades of research, the world changes quickly, and scientists and 
practitioners still do not have all of the answers. But OB scientists (heavily 
influenced by advancements in the fields of social psychology and sociology) 
have still made substantial progress toward this aim. It is our hope that after 
studying this chapter, you leave with a better understanding of the intersection 
between OB and diversity. More importantly, we hope you gain an idea of what 
can be done to effectively manage diversity and craft an inclusive environment 
in which people can flourish.
Understanding Diversity
We are, each of us, unique. Our uniqueness is obvious enough, but employ￾ees and managers often do not recognize, appreciate, and manage individual 
differences to forge inclusive and productive workplaces. Consider Mughal 
Emperor Shah Jahan, who employed 22,000 artisans from around the world to 
construct and design the Taj Mahal—today, this “crown of palaces” represents 
myriad influences, including Islamic, Persian, Ottoman, and Indian, among 
others.2
 Although diversity may seem like a new hot-button issue, in many ways 
it is something humanity has struggled to come to terms with for millennia. In 
this chapter, you will learn more about how individual characteristics like age, 
2-1 Describe the two major 
forms of workplace diversity.
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 76 13/12/22 1:59 AMDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Organizations CHAPTER 2 77
gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and culture can influence 
interactions and performance in the workplace. You will also see how manag￾ers can develop awareness about these characteristics and manage a diverse 
workforce effectively. But first, let’s more explicitly unpack what we mean be 
“diversity.”
Levels of Diversity
As we defined in the previous chapter, workforce diversity refers to the hetero￾geneous characteristics that make up organizations, work groups, and teams. 
When we think of diversity, we often think of mostly surface-level diversity, such 
as gender, age, and race. Surface-level diversity can lead employees to make 
stereotypes and assumptions about others from certain demographic back￾grounds. However, evidence has shown that people are less concerned about 
demographic differences if they see themselves as sharing more important char￾acteristics, such as personality and values, that represent deep-level diversity.
3
To understand the difference between surface- and deep-level diversity, con￾sider an example. Some of you may have worked in a professional kitchen or as 
a member of the waitstaff at a restaurant. You would certainly agree that these 
environments are often stressful: During busy periods, things can get hectic 
both in the kitchen and out on the floor.4
 To top it all off, there are so many 
people you have to interact with to ensure the customer has an excellent experi￾ence: the hosting staff, management, kitchen, runners, bussers—not to mention 
the most important people: the customers! All these people bring their own 
set of unique characteristics “to the table.” One of the kitchen staff members, 
Bellamy, is a young Black man from Austin who works part-time as a kitchen 
assistant while pursuing an accounting degree. Hector, his co-worker, a station 
chef, is an older Hispanic man who relocated from Honduras a few years ago. 
At first, these coworkers may notice their surface-level differences in race, age, 
or background. However, as they get to know one another, they may find they 
share a common way of thinking about work problems and have similar perspec￾tives on time management. These deep-level similarities can overshadow the 
more superficial differences between them, and research suggests that sharing 
similarities (especially similar work styles) will help them work well together.5
For example, if Bellamy and Hector have similar time management styles (both 
get to work on time and do prep work well in advance), they will be more likely 
to get along together and experience less conflict.
Although much has been said about surface-level diversity, experts recognize 
that these characteristics are just the tip of the iceberg.6
 In the next section, we 
review a few major biographical characteristics, recognizing that the groups and 
defining characteristics people identify with transcend this list.
Biographical Characteristics
Biographical characteristics such as age, gender identity, race, and ethnicity 
are some of the most obvious ways employees differ. Let’s begin by looking at 
these factors that are readily available—data that can be obtained, for the most 
part, from an employee’s human resources (HR) file. These and several other 
characteristics, are what comprise surface-level diversity. Variations in these 
surface-level characteristics may be the basis for discrimination against classes 
of employees.
surface-level diversity Differences in easily 
perceived characteristics, such as gender, 
race, ethnicity, or age, that do not necessarily 
reflect the ways people think or feel but that 
may activate certain stereotypes.
deep-level diversity Differences in values, 
personality, and work preferences that 
become progressively more important for 
determining similarity as people get to know 
one another better.
biographical characteristics Personal 
characteristics—such as age, gender, race, 
and ethnicity—that are objective and easily 
obtained from personnel records. These 
characteristics are representative of 
surface-level diversity.
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 77 13/12/22 1:59 AM78 PART 2 The Individual
Race and Ethnicity In an “Address to the Nations of the World” given in 
London in 1900, W. E. B. Du Bois noted that the problem of the twentieth cen￾tury could be found in how racial differences have been drawn upon to deny 
hundreds of thousands of people worldwide the opportunities and privileges 
of modern civilization.7
 Although problems with discrimination and preju￾dice, identified later in this chapter, are still major societal issues, laws against 
racial and ethnic discrimination are in effect in many countries, including 
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.8
We define race as the heritage people use to identify themselves; ethnicity is the 
additional set of cultural characteristics that often overlaps with race. Typically, 
we associate race with biology and ethnicity with culture, but there is a history 
of self-identifying for both classifications. Some industries have remained less 
racially diverse than others. For instance, U.S. advertising and media organi￾zations suffer from a lack of racial diversity in their management ranks, even 
though their client base is increasingly ethnically diverse.9
 Race and ethnicity 
have been studied as they relate to employment outcomes such as hiring deci￾sions, performance evaluations, pay, and workplace discrimination (which will 
be discussed later in this chapter).10
Due to systemic racism, racial and ethnic minorities report higher lev￾els of discrimination in the workplace.11 Black people generally fare worse 
than White people in employment decisions (a finding that may not apply 
outside the United States). They receive lower ratings in employment inter￾views, lower job performance ratings, less pay, and fewer promotions.12 Lastly, 
Black people are discriminated against even in controlled experiments. 
For example, one study of low-wage jobs found that Black applicants with 
no criminal history received fewer job offers than did White applicants with 
criminal records.13

Age Age in the workforce is likely to be an issue of increasing importance 
 during the next decade for many reasons. For one, the workforce is aging 
w orldwide in most developed countries, 14 and legislation in the United States 
has, for all intents and purposes, outlawed mandatory retirement. Most work￾ers today no longer have to retire at age 70, and 53 percent of workers over the 
age of 60 plan to delay retirement, likely due to the strong financial benefits of 
doing so. 15 Moreover, reflecting global trends, over 40 countries spanning all 
continents have laws directly prohibiting age discrimination. 16
 Stereotypes of older workers as being behind the times, grumpy, and inflexible 
are changing. Managers often see a number of positive qualities that older work￾ers bring to their jobs, such as experience, judgment, a strong work ethic, and a 
commitment to quality. For example, the Public Utilities Board, the water agency 
of Singapore, reports that 27 percent of its workforce is over age 55 and the older 
workers provide workforce stability. 17 Industries like health care, education, gov￾ernment, and nonprofit service often welcome older workers. 18 But older workers 
are still perceived as less adaptable and less motivated to learn new technology. 19
Despite the stereotypes, the majority of studies have shown “virtually no relation￾ship between age and job performance,” according to Harvey Sterns, director 
of the Institute for Life-Span Development and Gerontology. 20 The evidence is 
more nuanced for job satisfaction , an important topic discussed in more depth in 
the next chapter . A review of more than 800 studies found that older workers tend 
to be more satisfied with their work and report better relationships with cowork￾ers. However, one study drawing on over 20,000 participants spanning 40 years 
suggests that people are becoming less satisfied with their jobs the longer they stay 
at any given organization. Despite this finding, as people age, their job satisfaction 
tends to increase, most likely because their pay and benefits increase. 21 So as you 
get older, you should expect to like your work more and more! 
 Myth or Science? Bald Is Better 
 I
t appears true that bald is better 
for men in the workplace. A recent 
study showed that observers 
believe a male’s shaved head indicates 
greater masculinity, dominance, and 
leadership potential than longer or thin￾ning hair. Thinning hair was perceived 
as the least powerful look, and other 
studies have agreed that male-pattern 
baldness (when some hair remains) 
is not considered advantageous. Why 
is this? 
 In some respects, the reported 
youthful advantage of a shaved head is 
counterintuitive. Because we have more 
hair when we are young and contempo￾rary culture considers youthfulness a 
desirable characteristic in the workplace 
(if you doubt this, see the discussions 
on aging in this chapter), it would make 
more sense for a hairless head to be 
a distinct disadvantage. Yet the media 
is loaded with images of powerful men 
with shaved heads—military heroes, 
winning athletes, and action heroes. 
No wonder study participants declared 
that the men with shaved heads were 
an inch taller and 13 percent stronger 
than the same men with hair. 
 A bald head has become the hall￾mark of some important business lead￾ers, notably Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Lloyd 
Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Marc 
Andreessen of Netscape, and Shark 
Tank investor Daymond John. Men who 
shave their heads report that it can give 
them a business advantage, whether or 
not it makes them look younger (which 
is debatable). According to psychologist 
Caroline Keating, just as older silver￾back gorillas are “typically the power￾ful actors in their social groups,” so it 
is in the office, where baldness may 
“signal who is in charge and poten￾tially dangerous.” Research professor 
Michael Cunningham agrees, adding 
that men with shaved heads convey 
aggressiveness, competitiveness, and 
independence. Though we do not wish 
to advocate head shaving for this rea￾son, it does demonstrate how biased 
we continue to be in judging people by 
superficial characteristics. Time will tell 
if this situation ever improves. 22 
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 79 13/12/22 1:59 AM80 PART 2 The Individual
Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation The best place to begin to consider this 
topic is with the recognition that neither gender identity nor sexual orientation 
appear to affect job performance or leadership.23 In this text, when we refer to 
gender identity, we mean peoples’ deeply held sense of or identification with 
their own gender. It is important to recognize that gender identity does not nec￾essarily match one’s sex at birth, is not visible to others, and cannot be neatly 
categorized. By sexual orientation, we mean peoples’ patterns of enduring physi￾cal, emotional, and/or romantic attraction toward others. Differences in pay, ben￾efits, and rewards concerning gender are strong and substantial (see OB Poll), 
with recent estimates that they are up to fourteen times the size of performance 
differences.24 And biases and stereotypes persist, resulting in what has been called 
the glass ceiling, impeding the advancement of those who identify as women. In 
the hiring realm, managers are influenced by gender bias when selecting candi￾dates for certain positions.25 For instance, men are preferred in hiring decisions 
for male-dominated occupations, particularly when men are doing the hiring.26
Once on the job, they may be offered a similar number of developmental 
experiences, but women are less likely to be assigned challenging positions by 
men, assignments that could help them achieve higher organizational posi￾tions.27 Moreover, men are more likely to be chosen for leadership roles 
even though men and women are equally effective leaders. In fact, as of April 
2020, women held only 6 percent of CEO positions in S&P 500 companies.28
Furthermore, a study of twenty organizations in Spain suggested that women 
are generally selected for leadership roles that require handling organizational 
crises—positions in which they are usually set up to fail, a phenomenon com￾monly referred to as the glass cliff. According to Naomi Sutherland, senior 
partner in diversity at recruiter Korn Ferry, “Consciously or subconsciously, 
companies are still hesitant to take the risk on someone who looks different from 
their standard leadership profile.”29
These stereotypes counter the evidence that suggests that women are effec￾tive leaders in organizations: Not only does research from hundreds of stud￾ies suggest that women are rated as effective leaders in organizations, but it also 
shows that women’s representation in leadership positions is actually predictive

absences, make fewer mistakes, are

of financial performance in hundreds of thousands of organizations. 30 We have 
seen that there are many misconceptions and contradictions about gender in the 
workplace. Thankfully, many countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States (following the 2020 Supreme Court decision protecting gen￾der identity and sexual orientation from discrimination), have laws against gender 
identity and sexual orientation discrimination. Other countries, such as Norway, 
seek gender diversity through laws to increase the percentage of women on boards 
of directors. 31 Many organizations have implemented policies and procedures 
that cover sexual orientation and gender identity. Surveys indicate that more than 
90 percent of Fortune 500 companies have policies that cover sexual orientation. 
(More than 80 percent have policies covering gender identity.) Recent statistics 
in the Corporate Equality Index published by the Human Rights Campaign show 
that in 2022 93 percent of Fortune 500 companies had non-discrimination policies 
for sexual orientation and 91 percent had similar policies for gender identity. 32 
 While much has changed, the full acceptance and accommodation of 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other gender identifi￾cations (LGBTQ+) employees remains a work in progress. 33 In the United St ates, a 
Harvard University study sent fictitious but realistic résumés to 1,700 actual entry￾level job openings. The applications were identical with one exception: Half men￾tioned involvement in gay organizations during college, and the other half did not. 
The applications without the mention received 60 percent more callbacks than 
the ones with it. 34 Perhaps as a result of perceived discrimination, many LGBTQ+ 
employees do not disclose their sexual orientation. For example, Beck Bailey, a 
former employee at Stouffers in the late ’80s (now deputy director of the Human 
Rights Campaign Workplace Equality Program), recalled what it was like identify￾ing as a woman and a lesbian in the workplace, where it was difficult to be oneself, 
as well as the need to keep a picture of a “fake boyfriend” at the desk for fear 
of being discovered. 35 Organizations should be supportive of gender identity and 
sexual orientation diversity. Research suggests that disclosing gender identity and 
sexual orientation is good for reducing work–family conflict, improving partner

satisfaction, physical and mental well-being, and job satisfaction.36 Furthermore, 
transgender employees who undergo transitioning and gender reassignment 
surgery experience higher job and life satisfaction afterward, “empowered” and 
“free” to be their authentic selves.37
Organizations and managers are beginning to understand, little by little, 
that there are both ethical and financial reasons to be more inclusive: for 
instance, the LGBTQ+ consumer base accounts for almost $1 trillion in buy￾ing power. Companies like Apple are at the forefront of the corporate world in 
establishing policies that are sexual orientation and gender identity friendly. 
Apple, which boasts a 100 percent score on the 2020 Corporate Equality Index, 
has offered health insurance benefits to domestic partners (and has been doing 
so for decades) as well as six weeks of parental leave for new parents, including 
domestic partners.
Indeed, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity remain 
individual differences that organizations must address in eliminating discrim￾ination and promoting diversity and inclusion. Throughout this text, we will 
encounter differences between deep- and surface-level diversity in various con￾texts. Diversity is an important concept in OB because individual differences 
shape preferences for rewards, communication styles, reactions to leaders, 
negotiation styles, and many other aspects of behavior in organizations. 
Unfortunately, increased diversity may also mean increases in discriminatory 
practices, which we will discuss in the next section.
Prejudice and Discrimination 
in Organizations
Although diversity presents many opportunities for organizations, effectively 
managing diversity and promoting inclusion involve working to eliminate unfair 
prejudice and discrimination in organizations. In this section, we define and 
describe how prejudice and discrimination manifest in organizations.
Prejudice and Implicit Bias
It is important to note that prejudice may exist both within and outside your 
own conscious awareness—it can be either explicit or implicit. We discuss preju￾dice and its implicit form, implicit bias, shortly.
Prejudice Prejudice is an attitude (see the next chapter) representing broad, 
generalized feelings toward a group or its members that maintains the hierar￾chy between that group and other groups.38 When we refer to sexism, racism, and 
ageism, we mean prejudice toward gender identities, races and ethnicities, and 
age.39 Although we may often think of prejudice as involving uniformly negative 
feelings, benevolent prejudice can involve positive feelings.40 As some examples, 
people may view Asians as the “model minority” that does well in both aca￾demic and career realms,41 or they may view those identifying as women as kind, 
gentle, and deserving of masculine protection and support.42
Implicit Bias Implicit bias refers to prejudice that may be hidden outside 
one’s conscious awareness.43 Researchers have attempted to measure implicit 
bias through a very controversial test known as the Implicit Association Test, or 
IAT.44 (See the Point/Counterpoint in the chapter on perception and decision 
making for further discussion.) This test measures implicit bias through how 
long it takes you to respond to pairings of groups and attributes (e.g., evidence

M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 82 13/12/22 1:59 AMDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Organizations CHAPTER 2 83
of implicit bias exists if it takes you longer to respond to a pairing of “good” 
and “Black people” than “good” and “White people”). For example, one study 
using the IAT to measure implicit bias toward applicants with obesity found that 
hiring managers with bias toward the obese were less likely to invite people with 
obesity for interviews and grant them job offers.45 Further, some research sug￾gests that implicit bias is contagious and that people can “catch” implicit bias by 
observing others’ nonverbal communication and behavior.46
Regardless of the test and its controversies, the notion of implicit bias has had 
a huge impact on the world’s understanding of prejudice in and around orga￾nizations. Several organizations, such as Starbucks, have begun to offer implicit 
bias recognition training programs,47 and a number of consulting companies 
have emerged to offer this training to organizations.48 Whether prejudice is 
explicit or implicit, organizations should be concerned with prejudice and bias 
because they can lead employees and managers to engage in discrimination in 
the workplace (e.g., hiring and performance evaluation).49
Discrimination, Disparate Impact, and Treatment
As will be described in the next chapter on job attitudes, attitudes are often the 
best predictors of behavior. In the context of diversity management, prejudicial 
attitudes often predict discriminatory behaviors. In this section, we describe dis￾crimination and two of its forms: disparate impact and treatment.
Discrimination Prejudicial attitudes may result in discriminatory action, or 
discrimination.
50 Discrimination involves actions or behaviors that create, 
maintain, or reinforce some groups’ advantages over other groups and their 
members.51 Exhibit 2-1 provides definitions and examples of some forms of 
discrimination Actions or behaviors that 
create, maintain, or reinforce some groups’ 
advantages over other groups and their 
members.

discrimination in organizations. Although many are prohibited by law and 
therefore are not part of organizations’ official policies, the practices persist, 
and employees continue to report that they are discriminated against in the 
workplace.52 Tens of thousands of cases of employment discrimination are doc￾umented every year, and many more go unreported. Since discrimination has 
increasingly come under both legal scrutiny and social disapproval, overt forms 
have tended to give way to more covert forms like incivility or exclusion, which 
can be just as perilous.53
Disparate Impact and Treatment As the first row in Exhibit 2-1 illustrates, 
discrimination may also transcend the behavior of one person. Collectively, 
organizations can engage in discriminatory practices as well. Disparate impact
occurs when employment practices have a discriminatory effect on a legally pro￾tected group of people.54 For instance, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
prohibits employment discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, 
religion, and national origin, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act 
(ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against workers who are forty or 
older. Although disparate impact is unintentional (it focuses on the discrimina￾tory “impact” of neutral employment practices), disparate treatment is inten￾tional and represents employment practices intended to have a discriminatory 
effect on a legally protected group of people.55 Organizations go to great 
lengths to avoid disparate impact, which can present substantial legal challenges 
if it occurs.56 Managers and HR professionals are especially concerned with dis￾parate impact during hiring, as often the best predictors of job performance 
(e.g., structured interviews and tests) also tend to be potentially discriminatory 
toward protected groups.57 A great deal of research in HR and industrial psy￾chology has focused on how to improve prediction and reduce discrimination 
in the hiring process.58
Because employees who perceive they are discriminated against feel higher 
levels of stress and injustice in their workplaces, discrimination can result in 
a number of negative outcomes for employees, including negative job atti￾tudes and poor physical and psychological health outcomes.59 Discrimination 
can also lead to increased negative consequences for employers, including 
reduced productivity and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), more 
conflict, increased turnover, and even increased risk-taking behavior.60 Unfair 
discrimination also leaves qualified job candidates out of initial hiring and 
promotions. Thus, even if an employment discrimination lawsuit is never 
filed, a strong business case can be made for aggressively working to eliminate 
unfair discrimination. After confronting prejudice, it is important to recog￾nize that this can lead marginalized employees to a better outlook, increased 
job satisfaction, and post-confrontation relations with the person committing 
the prejudicial act.
You may have noticed that many of the discriminatory behaviors in Exhibit 2-1 
are overt: for instance, harassment, mockery, and insults can be extreme direct 
manifestations of prejudice. As a newer form of disparate impact to emerge 
in recent decades, managers are increasingly relying on social media infor￾mation to make staffing decisions. The issue is that employers who use social 
media information (e.g., reviewing candidates’ Facebook, TikTok, or Instagram 
profiles to find more information about them) can end up becoming biased 
by their demographic characteristics, leading to disparate impact even when a 
structured, systematically administered questionnaire is used to rate the social 
media profiles.61 As mentioned earlier, progress in legal protections against 
discrimination has led to an increase in more subtle forms of discrimination, 
which we discuss more in the next section.

Subtle Discrimination in the Workplace
Discrimination can occur in many ways, and its effects vary depending on orga￾nizational context and the personal biases of employees. Black and Hispanic 
pedestrians are more likely to be stopped, handcuffed, searched, and arrested 
by police. Black defendants are more likely to be prosecuted by judges. White 
students receive higher test scores from their teachers. And White patients 
receive preference for life-saving medical treatments.62 However, some forms 
of discrimination—exclusion and incivility, for example—are especially hard to 
root out because they may be very difficult to detect or are relatively informal or 
because the people are not aware they are engaging in discriminatory behavior 
to begin with.63 For instance, microaggressions are often referred to as auto￾matic, subtle, stunning exchanges between people that negatively impact those 
with minority or marginalized backgrounds.64 In the workplace, hundreds of 
research studies have uncovered subtle discrimination and microaggressions in 
very concerning occupations. Typically, these can take the form of microinsults
(i.e., rudeness or insensitivity) or microinvalidations (i.e., language that excludes, 
nullifies, or negates the thoughts, feelings, or experience of others).65
Whether it is overt or covert, intentional or unintentional, discrimination is 
one of the primary factors that prevent diversity. It may appear as if the impact 
of overt discrimination would be much larger than subtle discrimination on 
employees’ job attitudes and health outcomes. However, subtle discrimination 
and microaggressions can be just as detrimental as more overt forms of dis￾crimination, so organizations should be concerned with discrimination in all 
its forms.66 Recognizing opportunities to reduce prejudice and discrimination, 
and increase diversity can lead to an effective diversity management program 
and ultimately to a better organization. The following section describes the 
major theories behind prejudice, discrimination, and diversity in organizations.
Theoretical Perspectives on Prejudice, 
Discrimination, and Diversity
When many people think of diversity, they explicitly think in terms of repre￾sentation and differentiation. Clearly, the implications for diversity go much 
further beyond that. Although understanding the way in which people differ 
and focusing on improving their representation in groups, teams, organiza￾tions, and positions of power are critically important, an understanding of how 
diversity influences everyday organizational interactions is just as important. In 
this section, we describe four highly influential perspectives on diversity that 
help paint a more complete picture of the complexity of diversity.
Social Categorization
Although many aspects of biographical characteristics are objective (e.g., age 
objectively represents the number of years a person has been on this earth), 
there is also a subjective and perceptual aspect. For instance, despite many peo￾ple’s claims to “not see color” and that they are “color-blind,”67 all people 
engage in a number of cognitive processes to make sense of the world. During 
this process, our minds rely on heuristics, or mental shortcuts, to make process￾ing the massive amounts of information we take in from the environment a little 
easier. Unfortunately, one of these processes is active in our interactions with 
other people and forms the basis for many of our biased judgments of others. 
Social categorization is a process through which people make sense of others 
by constructing social categories, or groups sharing similar characteristics.68

which people make sense of others by 
constructing social categories, or groups 
sharing similar characteristics.
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 85 13/12/22 1:59 AM86 PART 2 The Individual
To note differences between people is not in itself necessarily bad. Noticing one 
employee is more qualified is necessary for making hiring decisions; noticing 
another is taking on leadership responsibilities exceptionally well is necessary 
for making promotion decisions. On the other hand, unfair social categoriza￾tion assumes that everyone in a group is the same rather than looking at the 
characteristics of individuals within the group.
To make sense of social categorization, let’s time-travel back to your days 
in secondary school. Take a brief walk around the school cafeteria or the 
mall after school, and you might come across students who instantly activate 
social categories. For instance, you might automatically categorize someone 
as a jock, an emo, or a goth based on their clothing (e.g., a high school let￾ter jacket, an expensive brand-name polo shirt, an emo band logo hoodie, a 
black jumpsuit and makeup).69 You may also associate these groups with dif￾ferent personality traits, with jocks as gregarious and outgoing and goths and 
emos more introverted and reclusive. But the category is not just in the eyes of 
outside perceivers—people themselves categorize themselves into groups and 
identify with those with whom they share characteristics.70 Furthermore, people 
are driven to group together and forge identities with people with whom they 
share interests, values, and other characteristics.71 These social categorization 
processes can lead people to separate and divide, forging a distinction between 
“us” (the ingroup) and “them” (the outgroup) and leading to bias as ingroup 
favoritism and outgroup derogation.72
Social categorization processes can affect OB in several ways. Social catego￾rization can lead to the fragmentation of work groups and teams. As people 
associate with those more similar to themselves, form subgroups with those peo￾ple, and judge others as belonging to outgroups, groups and teams can fracture, 
leading to lower team performance.73 Unfortunately, social categorization may 
also lead people to make inferences about what others are like or are interested 
in that are not true, or they may even lead you to misclassify them as belonging 
to that group.74 These incorrect inferences, as we discuss in the next section on 
stereotypes, are at the root of much of the prejudicial thinking that acts as a bar￾rier to diverse and inclusive workplaces.
Stereotyping, Stereotype Threat, and Stigma
One extremely important theoretical source of prejudice in organizations is ste￾reotyping. Through stereotyping, people may “typecast” others, or lump them 
into a category based on superficial, demographic characteristics. This process 
can lead those who are being stereotyped to experience stereotype threat and 
stigmatization.
Stereotyping People often allow their behavior to be influenced by stereotypes 
about groups of people. Stereotyping is judging someone based on our percep￾tion of the group to which that person belongs. To use a machine metaphor, you 
might think of stereotypes as the fuel that powers the discrimination engine. 
For instance, gender stereotypes can lead hiring managers to hire applicants 
who identify as men for jobs stereotypically thought of as “male-dominated.”75
Stereotypes can be insidious not only because they may lead to the formation of 
prejudice but also because they can affect how potential targets of discrimina￾tion see themselves.
Stereotype Threat Let’s say you are sitting in a restaurant (perhaps the one 
where Hector and Bellamy work!), waiting to meet with recruiters from an 
organization where you want to work for an informal interview. How would you 
describe yourself to the recruiters so they could find you? What identifiable 
stereotyping Judging someone based on 
one’s perception of the group to which that 
person belongs.
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 86 13/12/22 1:59 AMDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Organizations CHAPTER 2 87
characteristics would you mention so that they know a bit more about you and 
so that they can recognize you in the restaurant? Chances are good that you 
would mention something about what you are wearing or your hairstyle. Overall, 
you would give cues to the recruiters about characteristics that are distinctive, or 
that stand out, about you. However, with these characteristics follows the fear 
of being judged or treated negatively based on these superficial characteristics.
Stereotype threat describes the degree to which we are concerned with being 
judged by or treated negatively based on a certain stereotype.76 For instance, an 
older worker applying for a job in a predominately millennial-age workforce 
may assume the interviewer thinks they are out of touch with current trends. 
What creates a stereotype threat is not whether the worker is or is not up-to-date 
with trends but whether they believe the interviewer will judge them based on 
this stereotype. People become their own worst enemies when they feel ste￾reotype threat. Ironically, they may unconsciously exaggerate the stereotype.77
Second, employees may engage in self-handicapping, in which they avoid effort 
so that they can attribute their potential failure to other sources, such as stress 
or “having a bad day.”78 Third, people may overcompensate for the stereotype 
threat they feel or work to avoid confirming the stereotype. Fourth, stereotype 
threat can serve as a “brain drain” for employees, causing them to deplete their 
working memories so that they do not perform as well on employment tests or 
training.79
Stereotype threat has serious implications for the workplace. Stereotype threat 
can occur during preemployment tests and assessments, performance evalua￾tions, and everyday workplace exchanges. It can lead to underperformance on 
tests, performance evaluations, training exercises, negotiations, and everyday 
interactions with others as well as to disengagement, poor job attitudes, a reluc￾tance to seek feedback, and poor performance in the employees experiencing 
the threat.80 We can combat it in the workplace by treating employees as indi￾viduals and not highlighting group differences. The following organizational 
changes can be successful in reducing stereotype threat: increasing awareness of 
how stereotypes may be perpetuated (especially when developing policies and 
practices), reducing differential and preferential treatment through objective 
assessments, confronting microaggressions against minority groups, and adopt￾ing transparent practices that signal the value of all employees.81
Stigma Sometimes, people are concerned with being judged by or treated 
negatively based on attributes or characteristics that are not visible. These people 
are aware that there are negative connotations associated with these charac￾teristics and are thus motivated to hide or conceal them. Stigma represents 
attributes that cannot be readily seen, are concealable, and convey an identity 
that is devalued in certain social contexts.82 When a perceiver becomes aware 
that another person possesses the stigmatized characteristic, they may draw on 
negative stereotypes surrounding that characteristic and respond in a preju￾dicial or discriminatory way toward that person. For instance, many workers 
have felt compelled to conceal their gender identities and sexual orienta￾tions in the workplace due to fear of repercussion and mistreatment. The Not 
Another Second exhibit in Brooklyn, New York, has provided twelve LGBTQ+ 
elders a chance to tell their stories of spending their lives concealing their sex￾ual orientations, with many describing the psychological sting of hiding a part 
of their identities at work.83 Furthermore, jobs themselves can be sources of 
stigma. For instance, studies exploring so-called “dirty work” show how stigma 
can be attached to occupations and result in the stigmatization of workers that 
do these jobs. For example, garbage collectors may attract the physical stigma 
of being viewed as dirty and disgusting, but debt collectors may have to deal 
with a moral stigma.84

 Although the decision to disclose or conceal one’s characteristics is a complex 
and personal one, research drawing on 108 studies of nearly 10,000 employees 
suggests that disclosure is more likely to lead to beneficial interpersonal, work, 
health, and family outcomes for certain stigma (e.g., gender identity, sexual 
 orientation). 85 Of course, the decision to disclose stigma may not be a one-time 
decision—indeed, workers often have to make dozens of micro-decisions per day, 
in different contexts, as to whether to disclose. One study of LGBTQ+ workers 
found that there are immediate emotional consequences of concealment (reduc￾ing positive and increasing negative emotions) and identity expression (increas￾ing positive and reducing negative emotions). 86 The ways in which people manage 
their stigma to others matter. For instance, employees who authentically discuss 
the positive features of the attribute that others may stigmatize may experience 
less ostracism and more support from their coworkers. 87 
 Toward a Better World 
 Hot Chicken Takeover: Putting Restorative 
Justice into Practice 
 “Because we believe a crime record 
is often about circumstance, not char￾acter . . . we’re giving an opportunity 
for somebody to demonstrate a dif￾ferent story for themselves.” These 
words from Joe Deloss, the founder 
of Ohio-based restaurant chain Hot 
Chicken Takeover, demonstrate how 
some organizations are turning toward 
people who were formerly incarcerated 
or people with prior justice records as 
promising applicants. These “restored 
citizens” make up at least 70 percent 
of Hot Chicken Takeover’s workforce. 
This second chance has resulted in 
dedicated, motivated, and very com￾mitted employees at Hot Chicken 
Takeover. Shannon Wilson, a Hot 
Chicken Takeover employee who works 
as its executive coordinator, recalls 
having “the door slammed in my face 
multiple times . . . when this opportu￾nity came up . . . I was a better worker 
because that trust was instilled in 
me.” Shannon was addicted to drugs 
for over a decade and spent nearly 
half of one in prison. When Shannon’s 
sentence was through, Shannon had 
no money, clothes, or food. But Hot 
Chicken Takeover gave Shannon a sec￾ond chance. 
 Society, not more than a decade 
ago, considered this practice a signifi￾cant taboo. Today, surveys show that 
78 percent of Americans feel comfort￾able interacting with workers who have 
previous nonviolent records. Further, 
only 14  percent of HR managers 
would never consider hiring them, and 
82  percent of surveyed executives 
believe their restored citizen hires 
were just as successful as those with￾out prior records or incarcerations. 
Research shows that people with pre￾vious records or incarcerations are 
much less likely to return to prison if 
they can obtain gainful employment. 
These initiatives have the support of 
the United States government and 
influential HR professional organi￾zations. For instance, in December 
2018, the First Step Act was signed 
into law with the Society for Human 
Resource Management’s (SHRM) sup￾port, providing job training for restored 
citizens and encouraging organizations 
to recruit and hire people with prior 
records or incarcerations. Regardless 
of changing perceptions, there is 
still a heavy stigma associated with 
people with previous records or incar￾cerations. These individuals often 
have to engage in extra impression 
management during interviews, pro￾viding justifications and apologies for 
their behavior, even to the interviewer 
(who had nothing to do with what hap￾pened). Too often, the approach is 
punitive and completely ignores what 
happens afterward. Restorative justice
suggests that the focus should be on 
making amends (i.e., redemption), 
forgiveness, and reintegration in the 
workplace. This concept ties in heavily 
to organizations’ diversity, equity, and 
inclusion (DEI) strategies: enhancing 
diversity of the workforce, equity by 
giving people a second chance, and 
including them as valued members of 
organizations. 
 Of course, the decision to hire a 
person with a prior record or incar￾ceration is not made within a vacuum. 
Managers must still critically evaluate 
the hiring decision, just as they would 
with any other employee. For instance, 
managers could consider the type of 
crime committed and the nature of 
the job to carefully weigh the deci￾sion. A nonviolent drug record is less 
likely to pose a risk unless the job is 
a position that requires safety compli￾ance (e.g., drug addiction would pose 
a significant risk for a forklift opera￾tor). Timing and frequency matter as 
well—repeated, recent records are a 
greater cause for concern because 
they signal possible reoccurrence. 
The reoccurrence rate for violence 
and homicide is lower than any other 
crime. Still, many would feel uncom￾fortable working alongside someone

who was previously incarcerated for 
sexual assault, highlighting the impor￾tance of the nature of the crime and 
the workplace context. Furthermore, 
prior records of dishonesty (e.g., bur￾glary, theft, fraud) tend to be associ￾ated with a high reoccurrence rate. 
Managers should exercise caution in 
giving financial access privileges to 
these restored citizens.
Managers should also consider 
the national cultural and legal context 
behind their decision. For instance, 
although there is government sup￾port in the United States for these 
practices, the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has 
specific guidelines to follow. Suppose 
employers treat applicants with prior 
records or incarcerations from under￾represented groups differently than 
other applicants. In that case, they 
could be charged with discrimination. 
In other countries, opportunities for 
restorative justice depend on back￾ground check laws. For instance, in 
Australia, France, Germany, and the UK, 
minor records of applicants who have 
already served their sentence (with a 
set amount of time passed since the 
conviction) are considered “spent.” 
Employers legally cannot ask or inquire 
about them.
Hot Chicken Takeover and other 
organizations’ practices reflect a shift 
toward realizing DEI goals in the world 
of work. The careful practice of restor￾ative justice in employment practices 
poses an opportunity for organizations 
to make the world a better place. Giving 
people with prior records or incarcera￾tions a second chance extends an 
opportunity for them to rejoin their 
community as valued and productive 
members of society.88
System Justification and Social Dominance
Although the theories we have discussed so far have primarily focused on peo￾ple’s thinking about others, social dominance and system justification turn the 
focus toward the context. These theories concern why some people accept, jus￾tify, or even support prejudicial or discriminatory ideologies in the workplace.
System Justification System justification theory suggests that group mem￾bers may often accept, rationalize, legitimate, or justify their experiences with 
inequality, prejudice, and discrimination compared with other groups.89 In 
other words, over time, “the ideas of the dominant tend to become the ideas of 
the dominated.”90
For instance, in one study, those who learned about societal, systemic barri￾ers to executive leader success for people identifying as women were more likely 
to view these barriers as legitimate than those who did not learn that informa￾tion at all.91 Why do many people accept their negative experiences when it may 
be in their (and their organizations’) best interests to address them directly? 
System justification might be due to group members’ belief in a just and fair 
world, a motivation to reduce the uncomfortable inconsistency between what 
they deserve and what they get, and the extreme difficulty of challenging the 
authority and credibility of organizations.92 Moreover, system justification 
thrives when people believe that they have low personal control, that the sit￾uation is inescapable, and that they depend on or are grateful to the system 
(and do not want to jeopardize the relationship).93 However, research shows 
that thought patterns of system justification can be addressed; for instance, one 
study found that shifting one’s attention directly toward the restrictive nature of 
the inequality broke these thought patterns.94
Social Dominance We have discussed why some may rationalize or accept the 
inequality they experience. But why do some people seem to outright condone 
it? Social dominance theory may provide an explanation. Social dominance 
theory suggests that prejudice and discrimination are based on a complex hier￾archy, with one group dominating over another and the dominating group 
enjoying privilege not afforded to the subordinate group.95 In turn, people vary 
in the degree to which they believe in the theory; social dominance orientation 
(SDO) reflects whether people desire and support this hierarchy and whether 
they believe that some groups are inferior and others are superior.96 Many 
system justification theory The theory that 
group members often accept, rationalize, 
legitimate, or justify their experiences with 
inequality, prejudice, or discrimination.

researchers have suggested that an individual’s SDO is one of the most impor￾tant predictors of whether they hold prejudicial beliefs or discriminate against 
others. Similar to system justification, people may hold SDO beliefs as a way 
to legitimize inequality, believe in a just and fair world, and justify one’s privi￾leged position at the expense of others.97 Further, for those with a high SDO, 
increases in diversity may seem to threaten their place in the hierarchy, leading 
to prejudice and discrimination.98
Social dominance theory has a number of implications for organizations. 
For instance, applicants with a high SDO tend to be attracted to organizations 
of people who are similar to themselves and share in their high status.99 These 
applicants are also repelled from more diverse organizations, or organizations 
composed of low-status individuals. Furthermore, managers with a high SDO 
tend to be less likely to hire individuals from low-status groups.100 Taken together, 
SDO affects both managers’ discriminatory hiring decisions and applicants’ preju￾diced decisions to pursue employment in diverse organizations. While on the 
job, managers with a higher SDO judge low-status individuals’ job performance 
more harshly and less warmly, especially when they are perceived as obtaining 
special treatment.101
Next, we turn from explanations of prejudice and discrimination toward an 
enhanced understanding of how individuals contribute to workplace diversity.
Intersectionality and the Cultural Mosaic
People are complex. It can be extremely difficult to describe even a single 
person’s demographic and cultural makeup in simple terms. Given this com￾plexity, it makes sense that diversity theory should unpack this complexity and 
understand its implications for organizational outcomes. In this section, we 
describe intersectionality and cultural mosaic theory, two perspectives toward 
understanding the complex relationship between diversity and organizational 
behavior.
Intersectionality In the 2018 U.S. Open Finals, professional tennis grand 
champion Serena Williams was penalized several times in an escalating argu￾ment with the umpire.102 Serena, along with many other experts and officials, 
believed that the penalties were unduly harsh when compared with penalties 
that have been historically levied toward men.103 As Wharton organizational 
psychologist Adam Grant notes, “When a man argues with an umpire, it’s pas￾sion. When a woman does it, it’s a meltdown. When a Black woman does it, 
it’s a penalty”.104 Grant’s comment demonstrates that we are not merely the 
sum of our characteristics (e.g., middle-aged, Black, transgender) but rather a 
multiplicative combination of characteristics105 that sometimes interact with or 
counteract one another. This intersectionality, or the idea that identities inter￾act to form different meanings and experiences,106 highlights the complexity in 
understanding diversity in organizations and recognizes that social categories 
themselves may not be enough to understand individuals’ unique contributions 
to their organizations.
Intersectionality can unfortunately lead to enhanced negative effects for 
people with multiple stigmatized characteristics, also referred to as double 
jeopardy. Research has demonstrated that minority women, for instance, expe￾rience more workplace harassment,107 experience hiring discrimination,108
and are penalized more heavily as leaders109 than minority workers and women 
workers separately. Double jeopardy effects occur when negative stereotypes 
associated with multiple categories are activated, leading to more negative 
effects than among members of just one of the categories.
intersectionality The idea that identities 
interact to form different meanings and 
experiences.

Diversity as a Cultural Mosaic When it comes to intersectionality, there is so 
much more to people than considering the intersection between two demo￾graphic characteristics at a time (e.g., gender identity and age). Indeed, people 
are made up of multiple intersections and combinations of characteristics that 
make them uniquely who they are—and that affect their interactions with simi￾larly unique others.110 For instance, OB theorists have suggested the metaphor of 
a cultural mosaic: that people are made up of multiple characteristics, attributes, 
and identities that can be used to describe people.111 The tiles of a person’s 
mosaic can be biographical or demographic (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, gender 
identity), geographical (e.g., the climate, temperature, location), or associa￾tive (e.g., employer, religion, political affiliation, hobbies). Together, theorists 
have outlined fifteen sample tiles comprising an individual’s mosaic, which could 
result in at least 105 unique intersections between characteristics. Consider 
Exhibit 2-2 for an illustration of cultural mosaic theory. As we described in an 
example at the beginning of the chapter, both Bellamy and Hector are com￾posed of a number of “tiles” that contribute to who they are. These tiles influ￾ence how Hector and Bellamy interact with one another. Furthermore, Bellamy 
and Hector may even share tiles, such as their shared employer (the restaurant 
where they work).
Similar to the SDO described previously, workers may also hold cultural 
mosaic beliefs (CMB) that influence their support for diversity, acceptance, and 
inclusion of people from different backgrounds.112 Furthermore, workers 
may choose to emphasize some of the tiles in their mosaics more so than the 
others, depending upon the setting (e.g., at home versus at work).113 In gen￾eral, a review of the effects of taking this multicultural approach to diversity 
(covering nearly 300 separate studies) in the workplace uncovered uniformly 
positive effects: It reduced prejudice, discrimination, and stereotyping and even 
increased support for diversity policies.114
Returning to the example of Hector and Bellamy, consider the number of 
employees who may be working at the restaurant. Bellamy and Hector likely 
interact with dozens of other employees, each constituting their own unique 
mosaics of characteristic tiles. Clearly, there are so many ways in which organi￾zations can be diverse and in which diversity can influence common, everyday

workplace interactions. In the next section, we describe how diversity plays a 
role in these interactions, both between individuals and as members of a group.
Diversity Dynamics
So far, we have highlighted the role diversity plays for workers and managers 
in organizations. Indeed, discrimination and diversity perspectives can lead to 
negative and positive organizational outcomes, respectively. However, we have 
not delved into how diversity affects behavior within groups and teams. In this 
section, we discuss the role that group composition and fault lines play in our 
understanding of diversity in the workplace.
Group Composition
A common dilemma that managers and team leaders face in the world of work 
is how to build a team.115 We have already established that people are complex 
mosaics—naturally, groups and teams are inherently diverse collections of peo￾ple working toward common goals. We have also established that people natu￾rally group together, clustering into groups of people with shared characteristics 
and interests. When they have the choice to establish relationships on their own 
terms, they tend to be higher-quality relationships characterized by trust.116 The 
question becomes how should managers, knowing that people are different, 
build teams to increase performance and cohesion and reduce conflict?
Overall, studies tend to be inconclusive and depend on how diversity is 
indexed and conceptualized.117 Interestingly, there is only a modest link 
between actual diversity and perceived diversity, and some research suggests 
that members seek to balance a need to belong and a need to be distinctive 
in groups. Perceived dissimilarity and underrepresentation between yourself 
and the group you belong to tend to lead to negative outcomes.118 Differences 
between the group/team and its leader also matter, with justice perceptions (see 
the chapter on motivation applications) playing a strong role.119 Furthermore, 
recent research has become more interested in the effects of diversity in groups 
over time: how group and team diversity changes and evolves.120 After all, it is 
unlikely that the same work group or team stays together indefinitely.
Despite the inconclusive nature of research on group composition, a num￾ber of findings have emerged about surface-level, deep-level, and functional diversity
in groups and teams. Surface-level diversity appears to increase group conflict, 
especially in the early stages of a group’s tenure, which often lowers group 
morale and raises group turnover.121 Group members from various biographi￾cal backgrounds tend to come to the team with a different understanding of the 
task, norms, and goals—in other words, they are often not “on the same page,” 
making it difficult to coordinate initially.122 One study compared groups that 
were culturally diverse and homogeneous (composed of people from the same 
country). On a virtual wilderness survival test, the groups performed equally 
well, but the members from the diverse groups were less satisfied with their 
groups, were less cohesive, and had more conflict.123 Group outsiders are even 
more likely to be biased toward racially heterogeneous groups and allocate 
fewer resources toward them.124
At a deeper level, groups in which members’ values or opinions differ tend 
to experience more conflict, but leaders who can get the group to focus on the 
task at hand and encourage group learning are able to reduce these conflicts 
and enhance discussion of group issues.125 Research in Korea indicates that put￾ting people with a high need for power (nPow; see Chapter 8) with those with 
a low need for power can reduce unproductive group competition, whereas

plays in the interactions 
between people.
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 92 13/12/22 1:59 AMDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Organizations CHAPTER 2 93
putting individuals with a similar need for achievement may increase task per￾formance.126 Furthermore, diversity in how likely group members are willing to 
trust one another can fuel conflict and further erode trust over time.127
On the other hand, “functional” diversity, or differences in skills, abilities, 
experiences or other characteristics needed for the job, may improve team per￾formance and innovation, but these effects are contingent on several factors.128
For example, functional diversity can influence team creativity by facilitating 
knowledge sharing.129 Further, new ventures led by functionally diverse teams 
of founders tend to be more successful in competitive environments.130
Although differences can lead to conflict, they also provide an opportunity 
to solve problems in unique ways. Diverse groups may be less likely to fall into 
conformity and more likely to deliberate longer, share more information, and 
make fewer factual errors.131 Altogether, it is difficult to be in a diverse group 
in the short term. They tend to homogenize over time, they are fragile, and 
they tend to be prone to fragmentation.132 However, if members can weather 
their differences, over time diversity may help them be more open-minded 
and creative and to perform better. For example, research into the develop￾ment of identification in diverse UN peacebuilding teams across the world 
shows that team members develop a sense of identification but that this evolves 
over time.133
Fault Lines
One possible side effect in diverse teams—especially those that are diverse in 
terms of surface-level characteristics—is fault lines, or perceived divisions that 
split groups into two or more subgroups based on individual differences such 
as sex, race, age, work experience, language, and education.134 As we discussed 
in the prior section, social categorization can lead members of groups to form 
subgroups, leading to the fracture of the group as a cohesive unit.
For example, let’s say a group is composed of three Black and three Hispanic 
employees. The three Hispanic employees have approximately the same amount 
of work experience and backgrounds in marketing. The three Black employees 
have about the same amount of work experience and backgrounds in finance. It 
is thus likely that a fault line will result in the subgroups of Black and Hispanic 
employees in this group based on their differentiating characteristics.
Research on fault lines has shown that they are generally detrimental to 
group functioning and performance. Subgroups may compete, which takes time 
away from core tasks and harms group performance, especially when the group 
is under threat.135 Groups that have subgroups learn more slowly, make riskier 
decisions, are less creative, and experience higher levels of conflict. Subgroups 
may not trust each other and may have low levels of cohesion.136 Finally, satis￾faction within subgroups is generally high, but the overall group’s satisfaction 
is lower when fault lines are present.137 Are fault lines ever a good thing? One 
study suggested that fault lines regarding skill, knowledge, and expertise may 
be beneficial in a results-driven organizational culture. Why? A results-driven 
culture focuses people’s attention on what is important to the company rather 
than on problems arising from subgroups.138
How can fault lines be addressed or harnessed for good within organizations? 
Studies show that problems stemming from strong fault lines may be overcome 
when the roles are crosscut, when the group is given a common goal to strive 
for, and when similar pairs are recruited within a diverse group. Altogether, 
forced collaboration between members of subgroups and focus on accomplish￾ing a goal may boost performance in certain organizations.139 Pro-diversity 
beliefs and open-mindedness norms also help (and training can help improve 
this when they are low);140 for example, one study of international diplomats 
fault lines The perceived divisions that 
split groups into two or more subgroups 
based on individual differences such as 
gender, race, and age.
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 93 13/12/22 1:59 AM94 PART 2 The Individual
with the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggests that diplomat and team 
pro-diversity beliefs reduce the negative effect of fault lines on performance.141
Similarly, research on multicultural groups suggests that policies, practices, and 
procedures that welcome and accept diversity and that assume a diversity in 
thought lead to an effective exchange of thoughts and more effective teams.142
Cross-Cultural Organizational Behavior (OB)
We have seen that people sometimes define themselves in terms of race and eth￾nicity. Many people carry a strong cultural identity as well, a link with the culture 
of family ancestry, values, and religion that lasts a lifetime, no matter where the 
individual may live in the world. People choose their cultural identity, and they 
also choose how closely they observe the norms of that culture. Cultural norms 
influence the workplace, sometimes resulting in clashes or fostering alienation 
among cultural minorities. They are especially important for understanding the 
international assignments of expatriates in countries outside their home coun￾try (and what makes them fail or succeed in those environments). For example, 
in the best-selling novel Native Speaker, Henry Park is a Korean American indus￾trial spy who must cope with competing cultural identities—Park’s job requires 
interaction with multiple people, and Park struggles with whether to act “more 
Korean” or “more American” depending on to whom he is assigned.143
Cultural values are learned. They are passed down through generations and 
vary by cultures. As researchers have sought to understand cultural value differ￾ences, two important frameworks that have emerged are from Geert Hofstede 
and the GLOBE studies.
Hofstede’s Framework
One of the most widely referenced approaches for analyzing variations among 
cultures was introduced in the late 1970s by Geert Hofstede.144 Hofstede 
surveyed more than 116,000 IBM employees in forty countries about their 
work-related values and found that managers and employees varied on five 
value dimensions of national culture:
• Power distance. Power distance describes the degree to which people in a 
country accept that power in institutions and organizations is distributed 
unequally. A high rating on power distance means large inequalities of 
power and wealth exist and are tolerated in the culture, as in a class or 
caste system that discourages upward mobility. A low power distance rat￾ing characterizes societies that stress equality and opportunity.
• Individualism versus collectivism. Individualism is the degree to which peo￾ple prefer to act as individuals rather than as members of groups and 
believe in an individual’s rights above all else. Collectivism emphasizes a 
tight social framework in which people expect others in groups of which 
they are a part to look after them and protect them.
• Masculinity versus femininity. Hofstede’s construct of masculinity is the 
degree to which the culture favors traditional masculine roles such as 
achievement, power, and control, as opposed to viewing men and women as 
equals. A high masculinity rating indicates that the culture has separate roles 
for men and women, with men dominating the society. A high femininity
rating means the culture sees little differentiation between male and fe￾male roles and treats women as the equals of men in all respects.
• Uncertainty avoidance. The degree to which people in a country prefer struc￾tured over unstructured situations defines their uncertainty avoidance. 
2-5 Discuss the implications 
of cross-cultural matters 
for organizational behavior 
(OB).
power distance A national culture attribute 
that describes the extent to which a society 
accepts that power in institutions and 
organizations is distributed unequally.
individualism A national culture attribute 
that describes the degree to which people 
prefer to act as individuals rather than as 
members of groups.
collectivism A national culture attribute 
that describes a tight social framework in 
which people expect others in groups of 
which they are a part to look after them and 
protect them.
masculinity A national culture attribute 
that describes the extent to which the culture 
favors traditional masculine work roles of 
achievement, power, and control. Societal 
values are characterized by assertiveness 
and materialism.
femininity A national culture attribute that 
indicates little differentiation between male 
and female roles; a high rating indicates that 
women are treated as the equals of men in 
all aspects of the society.
uncertainty avoidance A national culture 
attribute that describes the extent to which 
a society feels threatened by uncertain and 
ambiguous situations and tries to avoid 
them.
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 94 13/12/22 1:59 AMDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Organizations CHAPTER 2 95
In cultures scoring high on uncertainty avoidance, people have increased 
anxiety about uncertainty and ambiguity and use laws and controls to 
reduce uncertainty. People in cultures low on uncertainty avoidance are 
more accepting of ambiguity, are less rule oriented, take more risks, and 
accept change more readily.
• Long-term versus short-term orientation. All societies vary in their focus 
on meeting the challenges of the present and future as opposed to 
maintaining a link with their past. Long-term-oriented cultures tend 
to assume that preparation for the future is needed because the world 
is constantly changing. These cultures tend to value thrift, persis￾tence, and pragmatism to prepare for the future. On the other hand, 
short-term-orientated cultures prefer to maintain a link to their past 
by honoring traditions, fulfilling social obligations, and upholding and 
protecting their image.
In recent years, Hofstede has proposed an additional dimension, indulgence 
versus restraint, which refers to a national culture attribute that emphasizes 
enjoying life and having fun versus regulating conduct through strict social 
norms.145Although it is fairly new as a dimension, some research supports its 
distinction from other values and shows that it is correlated with a society’s level 
of prosociality.146
How do different countries score on Hofstede’s dimensions? Exhibit 2-3 
shows the ratings of the countries for which data are available. For example, 
power distance is higher in Malaysia than in any other country. The United 
States is very individualistic; in fact, it is the most individualistic nation of 
all (closely followed by Australia and Great Britain). Guatemala is the most 
collectivistic nation. The country with the highest masculinity rank by far is 
Japan, and the country with the highest femininity rank is Sweden. Greece 
scores the highest in uncertainty avoidance, while Singapore scores the low￾est. Hong Kong has one of the longest-term orientations; Pakistan has the 
shortest-term orientation.
Research across 598 studies with more than 200,000 respondents has 
investigated the relationship of Hofstede’s cultural values and a variety of 
organizational criteria at both the individual and national level of analysis.147
Overall, the five original culture dimensions were found to be equally strong 
predictors of relevant outcomes. In sum, this research suggests that Hofstede’s 
framework may be a valuable way of thinking about differences among people, 
but we should not assume all people from a country have the same values.
The GLOBE Framework
Founded in 1993, the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior 
Effectiveness (GLOBE) research program is an ongoing cross-cultural 
investigation of leadership and national culture. Using data from 951 orga￾nizations in sixty-two countries, the GLOBE team built upon Hofstede’s work 
by identifying nine dimensions on which national cultures differ.148 Some 
dimensions—such as power distance, individualism/collectivism, uncer￾tainty avoidance, gender differentiation (like masculinity versus femininity), 
and future orientation (like long-term versus short-term orientation)—
resemble the Hofstede dimensions (although they are defined differently 
in some cases). Beyond these, the GLOBE framework added to or other￾wise split the Hofstede dimensions, such as humane orientation (the degree 
to which a society rewards individuals for being altruistic, generous, and 
kind to others) and performance orientation (the degree to which a soci￾ety encourages and rewards group members for performance improvement 
long-term orientation A national culture 
attribute that emphasizes the future, thrift, 
and persistence.
short-term orientation A national culture 
attribute that emphasizes the past, honors 
traditions, and upholds its image.

and excellence). In Exhibit 2-4, the linkages between the dimensions from 
the GLOBE framework and Hofstede’s dimensions are outlined. As can be 
seen in the exhibit, the GLOBE program also differentiated between these 
dimensions as they relate to practices (what is currently done) and values 
(what the society idealizes and aspires toward).

Both frameworks have a great deal in common and lead to similar conclu￾sions. For example, a review of the organizational commitment literature shows 
both the Hofstede and GLOBE individualism/collectivism dimensions oper￾ated similarly. Specifically, both frameworks showed that organizational com￾mitment tends to be lower in individualistic countries.149 However, GLOBE 
expands upon the Hofstede framework in a number of ways. For example, as 
can be seen in Exhibit 2-4, various aspects of the cultural values are disentan￾gled into narrower dimensions. Regardless, these dimensions of cultural values 
are incredibly important to be aware of in this day and age. With the advent of 
globalization, companies often engage in multinational projects, work in multi￾national teams, and send their employees to work in different cultures that may 
be radically different than what they are used to. Understanding what is valued 
(and what is not valued) in each culture is very “valuable” information to have 
today.150
Cultural Tightness and Looseness
Although we have discussed differences in values between cultures quite a bit, 
cultures can also vary in the strength of their norms. Similar to the concept 
of situational strength, which we discuss in the individual differences and values 
chapter, cultural tightness–looseness refers to the degree to which there are 
clear, pervasive norms within societies, a clear understanding of sanctions for 
violating those norms, and no tolerance for deviating from those norms.151

Culturally tight countries have historically experienced a great deal of threat, 
which has led to the emergence of clear, strong norms. For example, Japan is 
one of the countries most prone to natural disasters in the world;152 it makes 
sense that living under the constant threat of disaster requires tight norms and 
rules to coordinate and survive.153 On the other hand, loose countries like the 
United States tend to be more ambivalent toward restrictions to autonomy and 
liberty. As Michele Gelfand, the theorist behind cultural tightness–looseness, 
described, “The coronavirus response so far echoes [the United States’] loose 
cultural programming. It’s been conflicted. It’s been unstandardized, it’s 
been uncoordinated.”154 Cultural tightness tends to influence whether high￾performance HR systems are more or less effective. In tight cultures, there are 
strong norms in place, and so workers are motivated to follow them—as such, 
when rigorous hiring systems, training programs, reward systems, and participa￾tive decision-making practices are enacted by organizations, they tend to be suc￾cessful because workers tend to implement the practices.155
Religion
Faith and religion are a big part of people’s cultures and can be an employ￾ment issue wherever religious beliefs prohibit or encourage certain behaviors. 
There are few—if any—countries in which religion is a nonissue in the work￾place. For this reason, employers are prohibited by law from discriminating 
against employees based on religion in many countries, including Australia, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States.156 Reasonable accommodation, like 
that stipulated in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (see the chapter on 
HR policies), is also required for religious exemptions in the United States. For 
example, one jury awarded millions of dollars to Marie Pierre, a dishwasher at 
a Miami hotel, who was not accommodated (allowed to swap shifts) for need￾ing to request Sundays off for religious reasons.157 Religious discrimination has 
been a growing source of discrimination claims in the United States, partially 
because the issues are complex. Recently, Samantha Elauf, who was turned 
According to Hofstede’s framework, 
many Asian countries have a strong 
collectivist culture that fosters a 
team-based approach to work. These 
employees in a department store out￾let in Busan, South Korea, are likely 
to consider the success of their team 
as more important than personal 
success on the job.

down for employment for wearing a hijab (a headscarf), sued for religious 
discrimination. “I learned I was not hired by Abercrombie because I wear a 
head scarf, which is a symbol of modesty in my Muslim faith,” Samantha said.158
Discrimination cases like this have also been observed in research; for example, 
one study found that job applicants in Muslim-identified religious attire who 
applied for hypothetical retail jobs had shorter, more interpersonally negative 
interviews than applicants who did not wear Muslim-identified attire.159
Expatriate Adjustment
As described in the opening chapter, the experience of moving to a different 
country and adjusting to its new cultural, interactive, and work-related norms is 
a major undertaking for both the expatriate (i.e., the employee on international 
assignment) and the host country nationals. For example, many expatriates are 
extremely concerned with host country nationals’ receptiveness to their sexual 
orientations.160 If international assignments are not handled properly and 
carefully, poor adjustment can result in employee dissatisfaction, poor perfor￾mance, prejudice, and misunderstanding.161 Several factors can be targeted to 
ensure that the adjustment process goes smoothly. For one, feelings of empow￾erment along with the motivation to interact with those of other cultures were 
found in one study to be related to ease of adjustment, increased satisfaction, 
and reduced intentions to leave prematurely.162 Although adjustment tends to 
increase over time for all expatriates, those with previous culture-specific work 
experience as well as higher self-esteem and self-efficacy tend to adjust and be 
promoted more quickly.163 A review of sixty-six studies on nearly 9,000 expatri￾ates suggests that several other factors work in concert to affect different forms 
of adjustment, including language ability, relational skills, role clarity and auton￾omy, organizational support, and familial support.164 Finally, cultural tightness–
looseness matters: Nearly all expatriates will have a difficult time adapting to 
tight countries because they have to adapt to strongly observed, heavily enforced 
norms.165 These studies suggest that organizations should select employees for 
international assignments who are capable of adjusting quickly and then ensure 
they have the support they need for their assignment.
Cultural Intelligence (CQ)
Similar to the concept of emotional intelligence (EQ) discussed in the chapter 
on emotions and moods is cultural intelligence (CQ), which is a worker’s ability 
to effectively function in culturally diverse settings and situations.166 Consider 
two executives at a global networking event.167 The first executive, from Brazil, 
engages in conversation with an executive from Australia. The Brazilian exec￾utive stands in close proximity to the Australian and touches the Australian’s 
shoulder frequently. The Australian executive, uncomfortable with the close 
proximity and touching, keeps backing away, and it takes nearly a half hour for 
the Brazilian executive to realize what is happening. In this situation, a high CQ 
would involve understanding not only the cultural differences between the two 
executives but also an ability to perceive and adapt to the situation quickly to 
avoid cultural mishaps.168
CQ has been found to be associated with expatriate career aspirations 
and adjustment, job performance, psychological health and well-being, 
cross-cultural leadership, negotiation performance, and OCB in organiza￾tions.169 Furthermore, a study of real estate agents found that CQ predicted 
sales to culturally dissimilar clients, especially when their agency was supportive 
of diversity initiatives.170 CQ has motivational effects that influence worker per￾formance. For instance, individuals with high CQ feel more comfortable voicing 
their ideas with culturally dissimilar peers and supervisors.171

In developing your own CQ, you may want to keep two things in mind. 
First, research shows that executives’ experiences in multinational firms tend 
to predict their ability to manage international affairs when they are broad and 
general in nature.172 Specific experiences themselves do not predict the ability 
to manage international affairs. As such, the “cultural generalists” who acquire 
a broad range of experiences tend to be more effective than the “cultural spe￾cialists.” Second, in preparing to develop your own CQ, it may be beneficial 
to adopt a multicultural openness. For instance, exchange students who held 
an “us versus them” mentality (see the earlier section on social categorization 
theory) tended to be more sensitive to cultural rejection by host country nation￾als while studying abroad, which subsequently affected their adjustment to the 
new culture and the development of their CQ.173
Beyond enhancing CQ, workers, managers, and organizations can effectively 
manage diversity in their organizations in a number of ways. In the next section, we 
describe the opportunities and challenges of diversity management in organizations.
Implementing Diversity Management
Having discussed a variety of ways in which people differ, we now look at how 
organizations can manage these differences. Diversity management involves the 
use of evidence-based strategies to manage and leverage the inherent diversity 
of the workforce.174
However, a focus on diversity alone is not enough.175 The theory and research 
we have reviewed up to this point paint a bigger picture of prejudice, discrimina￾tion, and cultural misunderstanding that a mere understanding of diversity may fall 
short of addressing. Instead, organizations would do well to broaden their scope to 
focus on what can be done to ameliorate inequity, unfairness, and exclusion.
As a result, organizations have begun to focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion
(DEI) as three strategic and principled goals to strive toward.176 First, a focus on 
diversity involves celebrating rather than denigrating the differences between peo￾ple and enhancing the representation of diverse, marginalized people in the work￾force. Many of the topics we have discussed so far have focused on these issues.
Second, a focus on equity involves striving to provide access to the same 
opportunities for all workers, recognizing that some people are afforded privi￾leges and advantages while others are confronted with barriers and obstacles.177
A commitment to equity involves a commitment to equal opportunity and 
reducing prejudice and discrimination. Equity strategies include, for instance, 
broadly engaging with and collaborating with diverse communities, critiquing 
unjust structures, building coalitions, and education on inequity.178
In the United States, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC), following the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was established to ensure equal 
opportunity during the employment process, so that people are treated fairly 
without regard to their protected individual differences. In the United States, 
when some think of equity, they may think of affirmative action. Affirmative 
action is often misunderstood. Affirmative action in the United States does not 
involve quotas for minority groups (which have been ruled unconstitutional) 
but, rather, good-faith efforts to recruit, select, and train qualified minorities 
to enhance representation and fair treatment.179 Unfortunately, many think 
of striving for equity in unfair terms, portraying affirmative action as “reverse 
discrimination” and as ignoring the merits of the most qualified and even stig￾matizing those who benefit from such plans.180 Valuing equity and valuing 
merit are not mutually exclusive, as some have come to believe. In fact, research 
has demonstrated that establishing a multicultural meritocracy in which both are 
emphasized has the potential to reduce stereotyping and discrimination and 
increase engagement for all people in organizations.181

 An Ethical Choice 
 Affirmative Action for Unemployed Veterans 
 Unemployed veterans, take heart: 
Walmart wants you . In a historic 
move, the retailing giant vowed 
to hire any returning U.S. veteran who 
applied. As a result, the company hired 
320,000 veterans in 2020, exceeding 
their initial goal of 250,000 hires set 
in 2013 by 70,000. Other businesses 
have launched similar initiatives, such 
as the 100,000 Jobs Mission, which 
aimed to hire 100,000 veterans by 
2020. The coalition, which originally 
included eleven companies, now con￾sists of 230 companies from nearly 
every industry. As of 2020, 712,823 
veterans had been hired. The immense 
growth has prompted the coalition 
to commit to raise its goal to hiring 
1,000,000 U.S. military veterans and 
to change its name to the Veteran Jobs 
Mission. Is this an ethical choice all 
businesses should be emulating? 
 Few people would disagree that 
there is a need to address the plight 
of returning soldiers to America. Many 
veterans say employers do not want 
them. “There are a lot of companies 
that say they want veterans, but that 
conflicts with the unemployment num￾bers,” claims Hakan Jackson, a former 
technician in the Air Force. He is right: 
Unemployment rates remain higher for 
veterans than civilians. 
 According to some veterans, the 
returning soldiers are not competitive 
enough in the marketplace. Erik Sewell, 
an Iraq War veteran, suggested that the 
reason the veteran unemployment rate 
is poor is partly that vets often do not 
market their strengths well or showcase 
their transferable skills to potential 
employers. Bryson DeTrent, a twelve￾year veteran of the National Guard, 
found that companies are reluctant to 
hire veterans, especially National Guard 
members, fearing these employees 
may later be called to duty. Mental and 
emotional well-being is also a concern 
because employers may worry that vet￾erans suffer from post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD). Despite concerns, 
some managers report that veterans’ 
work ethic, team outlook, and receptiv￾ity to training are greater than among 
the general populace. 
 Sometimes, affirmative action is 
needed to give an unfairly disadvan￾taged workforce segment an oppor￾tunity to succeed, whether it is done 
through percentage quotas, number 
quotas, or hiring all prospective employ￾ees from the desired groups. But any 
program risks including underqualified 
individuals from the target group while 
excluding qualified individuals from 
other workforce segments. This might 
mean hiring an underqualified veteran 
instead of a well-qualified civilian. 
 Resources are always scarce, and 
there are only so many jobs to go 
around. Managers must balance the 
ethics of affirmative action against 
the responsibility of strengthening 
their workforces for the good of their 
organizations. 182
 Third, a focus on inclusion involves creating an environment in which all 
people feel valued, welcomed, and included. 183 A commitment to inclusion 
involves ensuring that all workers feel that they have the opportunity to contrib￾ute, to be involved in the decisions that affect them, and to be valued as a part of 
the team. A focus on inclusion involves recognizing that each worker, employee, 
and manager in an organization has their own unique “voice.” Inclusion creates 
an environment where these diverse voices can be expressed and resonate. 184
Consider, for instance, managers in a subsidiary, non-headquarters (HQ) coun￾try. It is often a challenge to ensure that such employees feel included as they 
are remote and disconnected from the HQ country. However, research dem￾onstrates that inclusion can be enhanced by actively seeking their advice and 
tapping into their well-connected, local networks in the subsidiary country. 185
These ethnically diverse managers feel valued and that they belong. As the vice 
president of Inclusion Strategy at Netflix, Vernā Myers, has said, “Diversity is 
being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance.” 186
 Although these strategies and goals are a step in the right direction, as we 
mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, OB does not have all of the answers. 
DEI is a modern challenge that society and the world of work are actively seek￾ing to address. Nevertheless, theory and research have established a broad and 
compelling foundation that workers, managers, and organizations can build 
upon to help move diversity management forward. In the next section, we 
discuss a theoretical basis underpinning diversity management that can help 
 inclusion Creating an environment in 
which all people feel valued, welcomed, 
and included. 
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 101 13/12/22 1:59 AM102 PART 2 The Individual
managers and organizations understand the phenomena underlying programs, 
training, and policies that are more likely to be successful.
Theoretical Basis Underlying Diversity Management
Too often, managers approach diversity management without an understand￾ing of evidence-based practices toward mitigating prejudice and inter-group 
conflict. Instead, they may latch onto diversity as a buzzword, promote repre￾sentation while ignoring prejudice, and neglect to address the psychological 
processes underlying diversity issues in organizations. In this section, we dis￾cuss the common ingroup identity model and the contact hypothesis, two 
evidence-based paradigms for reducing prejudice and conflict in diverse groups 
and organizations.
The Common Ingroup Identity Model The idea behind common ingroup identity
is simple: It involves transforming workers’ focus on what divides them to what 
unites them, changing perceptions of “us” and “them” to a more inclusive 
“we.”187 In essence, the theory uses the same social categorization mechanisms 
that divide people to, once again, unite them. For instance, research has shown 
that forging a common ingroup identity between citizens and immigrants 
reduced racism toward immigrants, increased positive attitudes toward immi￾grant inclusion, and even predicted committing volunteer hours toward sup￾porting immigrants or donating to immigrant support efforts.188 On the other 
hand, emphasizing the differences between people and glorifying conflict 
between groups tends to perpetuate and even fuel a desire for more conflict.189
Overall, the evidence on the common ingroup identity model has been 
promising. It has even been demonstrated to have an effect on implicit bias,
with experiments showing a reduction in bias scores on the IAT.190 However, 
although common ingroup identity is a powerful tool, employees and managers 
need to be careful not to use it in a way that inadvertently overshadows people’s 
diverse identities. Furthermore, the approach may also undermine some equity 
efforts, as workers begin to overlook inequality and become less likely to address 
it.191 (The same criticism is also true for the contact hypothesis, described next.)
The Contact Hypothesis The contact hypothesis proposes that the more people 
from diverse backgrounds interact with one another, the more prejudice and 
discrimination between the groups will decrease over time.192 In other words, 
contact reduces prejudice between individuals over time as they interact with 
one another.193 Contact may be one of the most promising ways in which major￾ity group members begin to think differently about diversity and become aware 
of and psychologically invested in the interests of minority groups.194 The con￾tact does not need to be physical, either. Research shows that virtual or even 
imagined contact can have an impact on prejudice reduction, inclusion, and 
anxiety reduction and can even lead to future, direct contact.195 Indirect contact 
can also have an impact. For example, even if you do not interact with members 
of another group, if your fellow group members do, it can have a contagious 
effect in reducing your prejudice.196
Thinking back to the sections on diversity dynamics and cross-cultural OB, 
you may recall that time leads initially diverse groups to reconcile their dif￾ferences. However, you may also recall that the initial outcomes are not the 
most desirable, and groups can often get off to a rocky start. The same is true 
with the contact hypothesis—negative experiences between members of dif￾ferent groups can actually lead to angry confrontations that initially reinforce 
prejudice, especially among those high in SDO.197 Similarly, intergroup con￾tact may be a less effective strategy in countries that emphasize power distance 
common ingroup identity The idea that 
bias can be reduced and inclusion can be 
fostered by transforming workers’ focus on 
what divides them (“us” and “them”) to what 
unites them (“we”).
contact hypothesis The idea that the more 
people from diverse backgrounds interact 
with one another, the more prejudice and 
discrimination between the groups will 
decrease over time.

and status hierarchies between people and groups.198 Further, stress and a 
lack of mental resources may dampen the positive effects of contact, suggest￾ing that contact-based interventions may be most effective in less stressful 
environments.199
Regardless, intergroup contact is a promising approach for reducing preju￾dice and promoting diversity in the workplace. For instance, imagined contact 
has been shown to improve hiring managers’ perspective taking—leading them 
to rate transgender applicants as more likeable and hirable than hiring managers 
who did not engage in imagined contact.200 Furthermore, in one study examin￾ing the performance of NBA basketball players and their coaches between 1955 
and 2000, players of the same race as their coaches initially received more play￾ing time from their coach—but the longer they were on their teams together, 
the more playing time coaches gave to players of different races.201
Diversity Management Practices
Organizations use a variety of diversity management practices to meet their 
goals of enhancing DEI in the workplace. As we just reviewed, there are a num￾ber of evidence-based approaches that can help inform diversity management 
effectively. Further, there is a business case for diversity management: Hundreds 
of studies have established a link between age, racial, cultural, and gender diver￾sity in organizations and company performance (e.g., competitive advantage, 
financial performance).202 When incorporated as a core component of business 
strategy, diversity-oriented programs can increase representation of minority 
groups, buffer negative effects of perceived discrimination, and positively affect 
an organization’s return on investment (ROI).203
But what do managers actually do? Unfortunately, many have yet to aspire 
toward these goals (if they consider diversity management at all) and instead 
focus on practices that are identity-blind or that single out minority groups for 
differential (instead of inclusive) treatment.204 Further, managers can become 
overly focused on preventing exclusion (e.g., complying with legal regula￾tions, avoiding disparate impact) at the expense of promoting inclusion (e.g., 
establishing a psychologically safe, inclusive environment).205 Despite missteps 
in priorities, the truth is that diversity management involves both beneficial 
processes (e.g., enhancing DEI) and detrimental processes (e.g., increased 
short-term turnover and conflict).206
Well then, what should managers do? We suggest that the most effective diver￾sity management strategy would be one that considers the unique needs of its 
workers, employees, managers, customers, and industry. Too often, managers 
approach diversity management in a one-size-fits-all fashion, failing to assess 
their organizations’ needs critically and authentically and relying too heavily on 
diversity “awareness” and not “action.”207 Multinational organizations should 
also tailor their approach to the countries and cultures in which they operate. 
For instance, a case study of the multinational Finnish company TRANSCO 
found it was possible to develop a consistent global philosophy for diversity 
management. However, differences in legal and cultural factors across nations 
forced the company to develop unique policies to match the cultural and legal 
frameworks of each country in which it operated.208 In the following sections, 
we discuss a number of diversity management practices that have been utilized.
Leading for Diversity Managers need to take an active role as leaders in pursu￾ing DEI in their organizations. Apart from the roles that leaders play, leaders 
should seek to develop personal knowledge, skills, and competencies related 
to diversity management. For instance, managers should seek out multicul￾tural experiences, develop their CQ and EQ (see the chapter on emotions and 
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 103 13/12/22 1:59 AM104 PART 2 The Individual
moods), and strive to become more flexible and open to new experiences.209
These competencies can assist managers in more effectively leading for diversity.
Primarily, leaders should assume four primary roles in diversity leadership: 
(1) advocate for diversity as a resource, (2) promote positive intergroup inter￾actions, (3) stimulate discussions and conversations among those of different 
backgrounds to manage the organizations’ knowledge, and (4) encourage 
continuous reflection on the organizations’ diversity practices, processes, and 
goals.210
To promote inclusion, leaders need to first focus on themselves with a sense 
of humility, authenticity, and understanding of their own diverse characteris￾tics. Armed with insight and an understanding of where they fit into the puzzle 
of the organization, leaders can (1) facilitate belongingness by supporting all 
workers as members of the team and including them in decision making and 
(2) convey that their uniqueness is valued by encouraging diverse contributions 
and helping all members fully contribute.211
Finally, managers can do much to promote equity in their organizations. 
Obviously, managers play a key role in establishing DEI strategy in their organiza￾tions. To realize this strategy, however, they need to clearly demonstrate expecta￾tions and communicate policies to employees so they can understand how and 
why certain practices are followed.212 For instance, they should confront preju￾dice and discrimination as it happens and encourage its reporting to HR with zero 
tolerance as well as look for and remove any hidden barriers to advancement and 
promotion in the company. Although these actions might involve risk on the part 
of the leader in particularly toxic cultures, they are particularly meaningful for 
marginalized workers. For instance, one study of transgender employees found 
that observing these acts of “oppositional courage” conveyed a powerful message 
to organization members, in turn, improving their self-esteem, job attitudes, and 
well-being while reducing their emotional exhaustion.213 They can also be active 
in setting structure: designing tasks, roles, hierarchies, and learning systems that 
promote equity and diversity of contribution.214 For instance, managers can pro￾mote equity through HR practices (e.g., recruitment, staffing, training, and devel￾opment), as we describe in the sections that follow.
Diversity Recruitment and Staffing One method of enhancing workforce diver￾sity is to target recruitment messages to specific demographic groups that are 
underrepresented in the workforce. This means placing advertisements in 
publications geared toward those groups; pairing with colleges, universities, 
and other institutions with significant numbers of underrepresented minori￾ties, as Microsoft is doing to encourage women to undertake technology stud￾ies;215 and forming partnerships with associations like the Society of Women 
Engineers or the National Minority Supplier Development Council. Research 
has shown that women and minorities have greater interest in employers that 
make special efforts to highlight a commitment to DEI in their recruiting mate￾rials.216 Furthermore, recruitment materials that promote perspective taking 
(e.g., imagining oneself as the victim of discrimination) have been shown to 
increase applicant attraction toward the recruiting organization, especially for 
majority group members.217 Diversity advertisements that fail to show women 
and minorities in positions of organizational leadership send a negative mes￾sage about the organization.218 Some companies have been actively working 
toward recruiting less-represented groups. Etsy, an online retailer, hosts engi￾neering classes, provides grants for aspiring women coders, and then hires the 
best.219 McKinsey & Co., Bain & Co., Boston Consulting Group, and Goldman 
Sachs have also actively recruited women who left the workforce to start families 
by offering phase-in programs and other benefits.220
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 104 13/12/22 1:59 AMDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Organizations CHAPTER 2 105
The hiring process is one of the most important places to apply diversity 
management efforts. Hiring managers need to value fairness and objectivity 
in selecting employees and focus on the productive potential of new recruits. 
When managers use a well-defined protocol for assessing applicant talent and 
the organization clearly prioritizes nondiscrimination policies, qualifications 
become far more important factors than demographic characteristics in deter￾mining who gets hired.221 As mentioned previously, HR managers should be 
well aware of the assessments and tools they are using to select applicants for 
the roles, taking care to reduce disparate impact. Assessments that are cogni￾tively loaded or that involve person-to-person interaction (e.g., interviews) tend 
to lead to the most disparate impact. Consistent with social categorization, 
people are motivated to form groups based on their similarities—such is the 
case with recruitment and selection, with applicants with similar biographical 
characteristics (to their interviewer) more likely to receive and accept job offers 
from them.222 This does not mean you should throw out interviews or tests 
altogether—it just means that care should be taken to reduce potential discrimi￾nation during the hiring process as much as possible.
Diversity Training and Development Most diversity training programs have 
three distinct components. First, they teach people about the legal framework 
for equal employment opportunity and encourage fair treatment of all people 
regardless of their demographic characteristics. Second, they teach people how 
a diverse workforce is better able to serve a diverse market of customers and cli￾ents. Third, they foster personal development practices that bring out the skills 
and abilities of all workers, acknowledging how differences in perspective can 
be a valuable way to improve performance for everyone.223 In general, diver￾sity training works: Reviews of hundreds of studies suggest that it is effective at 
improving diversity knowledge and representation as well as reducing discrimi￾nation in organizations.224
However, as we mentioned earlier, most managers and organizations are not 
thoroughly aware of their own DEI needs to begin with. Further, certain aspects of 
diversity training programs may be more effective than others, making a “needs 
analysis” all the more critical. In other words, a diversity training program may 
be successful at raising awareness for discriminatory practices but do very little 
in helping employees recognize their own biases. As such, managers should seri￾ously consider the DEI needs in their organization and tailor the training and 
development approach to address those needs. Second, training is only as good 
as the opportunities trainees have to apply what they learn. For instance, one 
study found that workers only applied the interracial perspective–taking skills 
they learned during training if they had close cross-race friendships.225 This find￾ing highlights the need for diversity training to foster trainee motivation or to 
encourage goal setting.226 Goal setting can improve trainees’ motivation to apply 
what they learned from the training. For example, goal setting led trainees to 
apply what they learned in one training program meant to develop supportive 
behaviors toward those of diverse sexual orientations.227
Mentorship programs may also be established to advance an organization’s 
DEI goals. Despite their general effectiveness, mentorship programs run into 
the same issues that staffing runs into with cross-race and cross-gender mentor￾ship (e.g., protégés and mentors generally prefer to associate with those who 
share the same biographical characteristics). In other words, managers are 
more likely to be White males who tend to select other White males to men￾tor.228 Regardless, mentorship may serve as a diversity development opportunity 
to pair workers with knowledgeable and experienced employees who may help 
that person’s personal growth and career advancement.

Cultures and Climates for Diversity
Too often, managers implement diversity management practices that fall short. 
They take action to overhaul their organization, but the organization will not 
budge. As a group of OB researchers once asserted, “Establishing a diversity pro￾gram is not enough.”229 While better representation, equity, and inclusiveness in 
organizations remains a goal, the shared perceptions of DEI in the organization 
are critical for diversity management practices to have a positive effect. Although 
we will discuss cultures and climates in more detail in a later chapter, manage￾ment will not be as effective unless managers consider the organization’s culture 
and climate for diversity. A diversity culture values and prioritizes diversity and 
inclusion and believes that it should be fostered within the organization. For 
instance, Ulta Beauty exhibits “championing diversity” as a key component of 
its mission and values and is openly committed to “magnifying, uplifting, sup￾porting, and empowering” Black voices in beauty.230 A diversity climate flows 
from a diversity culture and reflects the shared perceptions of diversity- and 
inclusion-enhancing policies, practices, and procedures in the organization.231
In other words, workers in a diversity climate are aware that there are norms, 
policies, and procedures that are enforced that support diversity, enhance inclu￾sion, and grant equal access and participation to employees.232
As with DEI initiatives in general, diversity cultures and climates simul￾taneously emphasize prejudice and discrimination reduction, enhancing 
representation, and advocating for inclusion.233 A positive diversity climate 
can lead to increased financial performance and customer satisfaction, com￾mitment, and retention and can even reduce the negative effect of fault lines, 
suggesting there are organizational performance gains associated with reduc￾ing racial and ethnic discrimination.234 A positive diversity climate in a host 
institution can also lead both refugees and expatriates to feel more welcome 
and adapt to life in a new country more quickly.235 Diversity culture and climate 
in many ways put the common ingroup identity model into practice, with all 
employees identifying with the organization as a cohesive group.236
The Challenge of Diversity Management
Although the field of OB has a head start (thanks to colleagues in social psy￾chology and sociology), diversity management is not cut-and-dried. Managers 
can craft evidence-based practices, a DEI-friendly culture and climate in their 
organization, and take strategic action toward DEI goals and still fall flat. 
Although new challenges to diversity management are still being uncovered, a 
number of these challenges have been well-documented. Managers would do 
well to consider and address these challenges in their own diversity manage￾ment initiatives.
First, authenticity plays a huge role. Leaders and managers of organizations 
are confronted with the challenge of demonstrating a commitment to DEI—but 
if they appear to be doing so for self-interested reasons237 or otherwise appear 
to be “all talk” (i.e., saying that they value diversity but doing nothing about 
it),238 they can lose all credibility. Furthermore, attempts to connect with all 
employees and appear more authentic (e.g., through humor) can also backfire, 
leading to diminished inclusion perceptions.239
Second, many leaders and managers half-heartedly committed to DEI will 
engage in tokenism,
240 or a perfunctory effort to enhance representation to 
make it seem like their company values diversity. For instance, an organization 
may hire only a small number of underrepresented people to meet diversity 
expectations and stop at that point. Feeling tokenized can have detrimental 
diversity culture The shared diversity 
values, prioritization of diversity, and belief 
that it should be fostered by members of an 
organization.
diversity climate The shared perceptions 
of diversity-enhancing policies, practices, 
and procedures among members of an 
organization.
tokenism When management makes only a 
perfunctory effort to enhance representation 
to make it seem like the company values 
diversity.
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 106 13/12/22 1:59 AMDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Organizations CHAPTER 2 107
effects for the worker or manager in that position and can be perceived by the 
public as inauthentic. Tokenism is, unfortunately, fairly common. For instance, 
an analysis of the S&P 1500 corporate boards found that more boards than 
expected by chance included “exactly two women,” a phenomenon the authors 
of this study referred to as twokenism. In other words, S&P 1500 executives were 
more likely to conform to their peers by hiring two token women as execu￾tives and less likely to add more women to the board once they reached that 
number.241
Third, diversity management can lead to several paradoxical effects. For 
instance, although appointing a member of an underrepresented group to a 
leadership position may in many ways legitimize diversity, leading to positive 
changes within the organization, it can also result in negative effects if that 
leader is tokenized, is put in that position to fail (like the glass cliff phenomena 
discussed earlier in the chapter), or has their diversity “put on trial” (a form of 
stereotype threat where they are pressured to excel).242
Fourth, organizations do not exist in a vacuum. The surrounding context, 
major events, and even the overarching diversity culture and climates at the 
regional level can have an influence on the success of diversity management. 
For example, even though an organization might have policies in place that 
support gender identity inclusion, cultural masculinity and femininity norms, 
gender role expectations, patriarchal institutions, and governmental policies 
(e.g., lack of protection for gender identity, wage norms) can undermine the 
effects of those diversity management practices.243
Despite the factors that may be working against diversity management 
success, employees, managers, and organizations have a responsibility to 
prioritize DEI. Not only does DEI help promote justice and fairness in the 
workplace, but it also can lead to enhanced job attitudes, well-being, and even 
performance. Although OB has a long way to go, workers and managers would 
do well to become educated and skilled in diversity management and work 
toward making their organizations inclusive and welcoming for people of all 
backgrounds.
Summary
Diversity management is a major societal challenge. Theorists, researchers, and 
practitioners in various fields are doing their part to understand how people can 
make organizations more diverse, equitable, and inclusive environments to work. 
In this chapter, we explained what is meant by “diversity” along with the levels at 
which diversity manifests. Although people can be characterized in many ways, we 
focused on three primary biographical characteristics relevant to the workplace. 
These characteristics include race/ethnicity, age, and gender identity/sexual ori￾entation. Next, we described prejudice and discrimination in organizations, two 
primary nefarious outcomes that result from intolerance for diversity. We moved 
on to describe theory from social psychology, sociology, and I/O psychology, 
which has influenced how we think about diversity in organizations. With this 
theoretical basis as a foundation, we described how certain diversity elements 
(e.g., group composition and fault lines) affect group and team dynamics. Then, 
moving up levels toward the organization and country, we described how cul￾ture and cross-cultural aspects of organizational life influence diversity, such as 
expatriates’ adjustment to new countries. In this section, we discussed religion 
as well as cultural intelligence, values, and norms. Finally, we discussed how or￾ganizations approach managing diversity through a three-pronged focus on DEI. 
M02_ROBB0025_19_GE_C02.indd 107 13/12/22 1:59 AM108 PART 2 The Individual
Although we know a great deal about diversity in organizations through decades 
of research and practice, there is still much work to be done. However, we hope 
that you have a clearer understanding of diversity in organizations by having read 
this chapter. You can use this knowledge of state-of-the-art diversity management 
to help organizations become more diverse, equitable, and inclusive.
Implications for Managers
● Strive to be aware of and sensitive to the complex implications of diversity 
in your organization.
● Assess and challenge your own beliefs, prejudices, and stereotypes to in￾crease your awareness of bias.
● Take efforts to root out illegal, discriminatory practices, both overt and 
subtle, in your organization.
● Look beyond readily observable biographical characteristics and consider 
individuals’ capabilities before making management decisions.
● Educate your colleagues, subordinates, and others about both the ethical 
and business case for diversity to increase buy-in for diversity management.
● Identify the potential impact of diversity dynamics in your groups and 
teams and be mindful of them when administering assessments, building 
teams, and resolving conflict.
● The more you understand and consider differences between cultural 
values, norms, and identities, the better you will be able to adapt to and 
manage cross-cultural dynamics in your organization.
● Implement evidence-based best practices when developing your organization’s 
diversity management initiatives, focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
● Strive to develop a diverse culture and climate where employees feel that 
diversity, equity, and inclusion are valued and put into practice and feel 
safe to contribute as their authentic selves.
● Be mindful of the fact that diversity management may not be successful 
right away. There are many barriers to its effectiveness, some avoidable 
(e.g., authenticity and tokenism) and some unavoidable (e.g., systemic 
bias, your organization’s cultural context).

 Using Artificial Intelligence for Hiring 
Leads to Greater Diversity 
POINT 
 Many C-suite leaders, including the CEO of Wells Fargo, have 
attributed a lack of diversity in their workforce to a limited 
pool of underrepresented applicants. As more and more 
companies increase efforts to diversify their workforce, artificial intelli￾gence (AI) is revolutionizing how companies recruit and select employ￾ees. On a basic level, AI offers the opportunity to access a wider pool 
of applicants. For example, many companies have traditionally used 
on-campus recruiting. Organizations can send only a limited number 
of people to job fairs, and some quality candidates may not even at￾tend them. Furthermore, recruiting may be narrowly targeted toward 
elite university students. However, only 6 percent of first-year students 
at elite universities are Black. 
 Although many organizations have implemented implicit bias 
training with some success, AI does not have the same unconscious 
biases as human interviewers. Human interviewers may not be able to 
pinpoint precisely how unconscious bias has impacted their decisions 
because humans often rely on intuition or a “gut feeling.” Utilizing AI 
ensures that HR managers apply the same hiring criteria to every can￾didate. For example, companies like OutMatch use video interviewing 
technology to conduct the same interview with the same questions 
for every candidate. Even if biases stem from the AI programming, it 
is significantly easier to spot where they occur in the algorithm and 
address them than for human biases. 
 Some organizations may worry that using AI in the hiring pro￾cess will make their company seem detached. Greg Moran, CEO of 
OutMatch, contends that the opposite is true. Automating repetitive 
tasks enables hiring managers to focus on the more essential ones, 
such as developing a personal connection with job candidates. While 
increasing workforce diversity is just one aspect of an organization’s 
diversity management strategy, AI depicts a promising future of a less 
biased hiring process. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 Many companies are likely ignoring or overlooking that AI can 
be just as biased as humans. AI tools are like all other algo￾rithms in that humans train them. Even though an organiza￾tion likely has good intentions when using AI, bias can still be present. 
For example, a model could be built that determines the common 
characteristics in a company’s current workforce. An AI tool could 
learn to filter out individuals with specific biographical characteristics 
instead of those relevant for success on the job if the current work￾force is not diverse. 
 There is also some concern over the lack of transparency in some 
AI vendors regarding how their platforms work. For instance, these 
tools’ popularity has led to greater scrutiny, particularly from the gov￾ernment. In January 2020, Illinois introduced a law regulating AI in 
video job interviews. The law requires employers to inform job candi￾dates that they will use AI to analyze the interview, explain how the AI 
works, and obtain consent from the candidate. Many would argue that 
informing candidates of the use of AI and obtaining their consent for 
its use is an often-omitted ethical consideration for using AI. 
 Lastly, many suggest that AI must be monitored and supervised, 
like an employee who is making hiring decisions. Just as human 
choices can be audited and examined for bias (e.g., disparate impact 
or treatment), it may also be possible to look for bias in algorithms. 
Some might argue that this is relatively easy in AI and suggest that 
employers regularly audit AI to prevent discrimination as a solution. 
However, this process will still likely prove to be difficult for organiza￾tions. As many AI and machine learning professionals contend, there 
is “no free lunch” when it comes to AI. No one algorithm can solve 
all organizations’ problems; an algorithm optimized to solve a spe￾cific problem (e.g., hiring candidates) may pay for this performance 
with problems in other domains (e.g., hiring underrepresented can￾didates). The challenge of simultaneously prioritizing multiple goals is 
the same regardless of the tools one uses. 
 Further, it would be a mistake to say that AI could ever fully replace 
people, including human resource professionals and hiring managers. 
Even though AI can be incredibly sophisticated and make sense of 
very complex data, it can often lose the forest for the trees. AI can 
arrive at nonsensical conclusions that humans would be more likely 
to pick up on. For instance, researchers demonstrated that four well￾placed stickers on a “STOP” sign could “fool” the self-driving car’s AI 
algorithm. The AI read the sign as a “45” speed limit sign and sped 
into a busy intersection. Humans would have been arguably more 
likely to see and interpret these stickers for what they were. The value 
of people in supervising AI cannot be overstated. HR professionals 
and hiring managers’ roles in implementing diversity management, 
building relationships with potential job candidates, and supervising 
AI are essential. 244

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
Diversity, in a variety of forms, is vital to the application 
of OB in the workplace. First, workplace discrimination 
can undermine an organization’s effectiveness and can 
lead to many poor outcomes. Knowledge of diversity in 
OB can help you and your organization manage diversi￾ty effectively. Understanding diversity can also help you 
work effectively with coworkers who may be different from 
you in various ways. Second, cultures worldwide vary on 
the values that are important to them. Being aware of 
these different cultural values and spending time abroad 
can improve your cultural intelligence and help you in￾teract more effectively with those of different cultural 
backgrounds. In this chapter, you improved your critical 
thinking skills and learned various ways to approach is￾sues of social responsibility through encountering how 
elements of one’s appearance can affect perceptions in 
the workplace, examining how some organizations focus 
on restorative equity by hiring applicants with prior justice 
system involvement or who were previously incarcerated, 
and considering artificial intelligence applications toward 
hiring a more diverse workforce. In the following section, 
you will have more opportunities to develop these skills 
by recognizing the differences and similarities between 
you and your classmates, considering how you can begin 
a conversation about DEI with your (potential) employer, 
and critiquing whether diversity training is truly effective.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Differences
The instructor randomly assigns the class into groups 
of four. It is important that group membership is truly 
randomly decided, not done by seating, friendships, or 
preferences. Without discussion, each group member 
first answers the following question on paper:
2-7. How diverse is your group, on a scale of 1 to 10, 
where 1 = very dissimilar and 10 = very similar?
Each person puts their paper away and shares with the 
group answers to the following questions:
• What games/toys did you like to play with when you were 
young?
• What do you consider to be your most sacred value 
(and why)?
• Are you spiritual at all?
• Tell us a little about your family.
• Where’s your favorite place on earth and why?
Each group member then answers the following question 
on paper:
2-8. How diverse is your group, on a scale of 1 to 10, 
where 1 = very dissimilar and 10 = very similar?
After groups calculate the average ratings from before 
and after the discussion, they will share with the class the 
difference between their averages and answer the 
following questions:
2-9. Did your personal rating increase after 
the discussion? Did your group’s average 
ratings increase after the discussion?
2-10. Do you think that, if you had more time for discus￾sion, your group’s average rating would increase?
2-11. What do you see as the role of surface-level 
diversity and deep-level diversity in a group’s 
acceptance of individual differences?
ETHICAL DILEMMA Should You Question an Employer About Its DEI Policy?
Imagine that you are at a job interview. The job is for a 
position that would include a substantial pay raise from 
what you are making now and significantly help you ad￾vance your career. You do not want to do anything to 
jeopardize your chances of landing the position. While 
the interviewer mentions that the company values diver￾sity, you have heard through your extended network that 
this is not always the case.
Furthermore, this issue is important to you because 
you feel excluded from your current company. For 
instance, your employer seems to mention their DEI 
goals every chance they get, yet you still feel excluded. 
The company highly encourages participating in their 
social events, but every time you have attended one, it 
has been challenging to connect with your coworkers. 
You also cannot help but wonder why management did 
not select you for a promotion in your current job. You 
were just as qualified as your promoted coworker and 
worry that you were passed over because of your back￾ground (either unintentionally or intentionally). It 
does not help your company’s case that there are very 
few members of underrepresented groups in senior 
leadership positions.
You are in the early stages of looking for a new job, but 
you believe it would be difficult to find a position better 
than the one you are in now. The question is: Do you ask 
the company specific questions about how it creates a di￾verse, equitable, and inclusive work environment? Or do 
you take the company’s word for it?

Questions
2-12. If you were in a similar situation, would 
you question a potential or current em￾ployer’s DEI policy? Why or why not?
2-13. What are the ethical considerations surrounding 
the situation? What are the rights, duties, and 
obligations of the employer and employee in this 
situation?
2-14. If you decided to ask about the DEI policy, what 
types of questions would you ask, or how would 
you go about broaching the topic? If you decided 
not to ask about the DEI policy, what actions, if 
any, would you take?
2-15. Beyond increasing its workforce diversity, what 
other types of practices should an organization 
implement to foster an equitable and inclusive 
work environment?245
CASE INCIDENT Encouraging Female Engineers
When Jess Stone tells people she is training to become an 
engineer, they often remark that she does not look like 
the kind of person who would “fix a boiler.” According to 
the 23-year-old, who works for aerospace company Airbus, 
“There’s a bit of a misunderstanding around the term ‘engi￾neer.’ Oily overalls? These ideas are so outdated.”
While 47 percent of the UK workforce is female, the 
figure for those working in core engineering occupations 
is just 12 percent. In engineering businesses, it is only 
9 percent, according to Engineering UK. “Times have 
changed. There has been progress, but it’s still a male 
bastion,” says Margaret Craddock, who has spent 33 years 
in the sector. She recalls one eager salesman visiting her 
site office 30 years ago, when she was the co-owner of a 
machinery business, and asking her, “Is there anybody im￾portant here?” More recently, she has also heard men ask 
women in the sector, “Are you a real engineer?”
In her current role as BatchLine Division lead with 
Dyer Engineering, a fabrication and machining business 
in County Durham, Craddock does come across women, 
but mostly in engineering purchasing departments. “But 
when you get to welding and machining, it’s a harsh envi￾ronment. It’s noisy; it’s dangerous,” she says.
With a retiring workforce and technology creating new 
opportunities, engineering in Britain is suffering from se￾vere skills shortages, and new blood is urgently needed. 
According to EngineeringUK’s 2018 report, the sector has 
an annual demand for 124,000 engineers and technicians 
with core engineering skills but faces a shortfall of up to 
59,000 every year.
Engineering offers exciting prospects and fascinating 
work. “I really enjoy the technical challenges,” says Emilie 
Weaving, a mechanical development engineer working 
for construction equipment manufacturer JCB. Salaries 
are also good. According to Engineering UK, gradu￾ates with an engineering and technology degree had an 
average starting salary of around €30,000, above the all￾subject average of €24,500. Despite eager recruits like 
Ms. Weaving and Ms. Stone, the lack of diversity in UK 
engineering is a concern for the sector.
When it comes to international comparisons, the 
United Kingdom scores poorly. According to Hayaatun 
Sillem, Chief Executive of the Royal Academy of 
Engineering, it “has the lowest proportion of female pro￾fessional engineers of any European country.” But that is 
not to say that this is only a British issue; proportions are 
low across the continent.
Recruitment isn’t the only issue; there’s also a reten￾tion problem. A 2017 report from the Institution of 
Mechanical Engineers said that within a few years of 
gaining an engineering degree, just under half of the 
United Kingdom’s female engineering graduates were 
leaving the profession, while two-thirds of male engi￾neers remained. Clearly, this is a huge waste of women’s 
potential. 246
Questions
2-16. What factors may have caused the low par￾ticipation rate of females in engineering?
2-17. What could be done to attract more women 
and other underrepresented groups to the 
profession? 
2-18. Retention of women engineers is also an issue. How 
could this be improved?

 IN THE LEGOLAND WONDERLAND 
I
magine working in a workplace divided into flexible work zones with no 
specific seating arrangements and no offices for managers, where you can 
choose to work in different settings that can support the activities or tasks 
you are performing, within an environment that can provide the ambience 
that helps you perform at your best. Imagine a workplace that has a variety of 
spaces that support different types of individual work as well as teamwork, a 
workplace that includes a library, quiet-zone booths (which are do-not-disturb 
places), areas that are equipped with high partitions for “head down” work, 
as well as small, closed rooms for complete privacy and circular “study 
caves” carved out of a wall for individual contemplation or rest. A workplace 
where technology enhances job satisfaction and innovation plays a key role, 
and where creativity is constantly stimulated in various ways. A workplace 
that, apart from the workspace, includes a wellness center (containing gyms, 
massage rooms, a swimming pool, a multiuse indoor sports pitch, etc.), a 
rooftop garden split over multiple storeys, and cafés where you can grab 
healthy and reenergizing food and beverages. This has been the vision, and 
ultimately the reality, for Lego’s work environment setup. 
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 113 21/12/22 6:44 AM114 PART 2 The Individual
Some will wonder, why go to such lengths to create such an office 
environment? Lego shares a philosophy with Google, Microsoft, and Facebook 
that their staff must be encouraged to be creative and to become, and they 
seek to achieve this by providing exemplary working environments. They have 
embedded in their organizational culture the belief that employees’ momentum 
and well-being is key to improving job satisfaction. Sophie Patrikios, Senior 
Director of Consumer Services at Lego, has stated that the leadership at the 
company is always supportive and driven by a clear vision; it is not fixated 
on numbers but on the core values of the company deriving from its vision. 
Conversely, behaviors that are not in line with the values and the vision of the 
company have no place in it. The company seeks to instill its values and vision 
by encouraging management to allow space for creativity and initiative.
Many at Lego will aver that thinking and behaving like this is in the 
company’s DNA, linked to their famous bricks, an outlet for creativity of many 
a child (and adult). Others would add that this company has an authentic 
reverence for its employees, seeking not just to appeal to their minds in 
motivating performance but also to their hearts.
More prosaically, others will see this as a way to reengineer traditional HR 
to ensure a happy workforce for an ultimately profitable workplace. But if all 
these play an important role in employees’ overall job satisfaction—and of 
course they do indeed—how do these elements actually affect the way they 
formulate their attitudes about the company’s human resource management 
philosophy and approach?1
I
t is a truism to say that a happy worker is a productive worker. However, 
there are a variety of contributors to job attitudes that may change 
over time. What factors besides organizational culture, leadership, and 
infrastructure affect job attitudes? Does having a satisfying job really matter? 
Before we tackle these important questions, it is important to define what we 
mean by attitudes generally and by job attitudes in particular.
Attitudes
3-1 Contrast the three 
components of an attitude.
Attitudes are judgments or evaluative statements—either favorable or 
unfavorable—about objects, people, or events. They reflect how we feel about 
something. When you say, “I like my job,” you are expressing your attitude 
about your work.
Attitudes are complex. Let’s say that you are interested in becoming an accoun￾tant. If you were to ask accountants and auditors their attitudes toward their job, 
you may get simple responses (e.g., “No, I hate my work,” “Being an accountant 
is fantastic!” etc.), but the underlying reasons are likely more complicated. For 
example, accountants who perceive that their jobs have challenges, great benefits, 
attitudes Judgments or evaluative 
statements about objects, people, or events.
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 114 21/12/22 6:44 AMJob Attitudes CHAPTER 3 115
and supportive management are much more likely to be happier with their jobs.2
In this chapter, as we will see, how satisfied you are with what you do, how commit￾ted you are to your employer, and other attitudes are significant considerations in 
the workplace. If you like your job, you are more willing to stay, do your work well, 
and even go above and beyond to make sure the work gets done. To fully under￾stand attitudes, we must consider their fundamental properties or components.
Typically, researchers assume that attitudes have three components: cog￾nition, affect, and behavior.3
 The statement “My pay is low” is a cognitive 
component of an attitude—an opinion or belief about the attitude target (e.g., 
your supervisor). It sets the stage for the more critical part of an attitude—its 
affective component. Affect is the emotional or feeling segment of an attitude 
reflected in the statement “I am angry over how little I’m paid.” Affect can lead 
to behavioral outcomes. The behavioral component of an attitude describes an 
intention to behave a certain way toward someone or something—as in “I’m 
going to look for another job that pays better.”
Viewing attitudes as having three components—affect, behavior, and cogni￾tion (e.g., the ABCs of attitudes)—helps us understand their complexity and 
the potential relationship between attitudes and behavior. For example, imag￾ine you just now) realized that someone treated you unfairly. Aren’t you likely to 
have almost instantaneous feelings occurring along with this realization? Thus, 
cognition and affect are intertwined.
Exhibit 3-1 illustrates how the three components of an attitude are related. 
Let’s imagine that you did not get a promotion you thought you deserved. Your 
attitude toward your supervisor is illustrated as follows: You thought you deserved 
the promotion (cognition), you strongly dislike your supervisor (affect), and 
you have complained and taken action or otherwise intend to (behavior).
cognitive component The opinion or belief 
segment of an attitude.
affective component The emotional or 
feeling segment of an attitude.
behavioral component An intention to 
behave in a certain way toward someone or 
something.

Attitudes are judgments or evaluative statements—either favorable or 
unfavorable—about objects, people, or events. They reflect how we feel about 
something. When you say, “I like my job,” you are expressing your attitude 
about your work.
Attitudes are complex. Let’s say that you are interested in becoming an accoun￾tant. If you were to ask accountants and auditors their attitudes toward their job, 
you may get simple responses (e.g., “No, I hate my work,” “Being an accountant 
is fantastic!” etc.), but the underlying reasons are likely more complicated. For 
example, accountants who perceive that their jobs have challenges, great benefits, 
attitudes Judgments or evaluative 
statements about objects, people, or events.
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 115 21/12/22 6:44 AM116 PART 2 The Individual
In organizations, attitudes are important for their behavioral component. 
If an accountant believes, for example, that they have no attachment to their 
firm and could get better opportunities with other firms, this belief could lead 
to whether they stay or leave their job. Understanding how this commitment is 
formed and how it might be changed is essential to managers who want to reduce 
turnover. Interestingly, some research from the Netherlands suggests that the 
cognitive component is most important for predicting who will become commit￾ted to the organization (e.g., newcomers in an onboarding program) or uncom￾mitted (e.g., unattached accountants considering leaving for better positions).4
3-2 Summarize the relationship 
between attitudes and 
behavior.
Attitudes and Behavior
Perhaps it is easy to think of how attitudes can cause people to behave in certain 
ways. Using our previous examples, accountants who are not satisfied with their 
jobs or committed to their organizations may start looking for work elsewhere. 
Research, in general, supports the idea that attitudes predict future behavior.5
Several powerful characteristics change the nature of the attitudes-behavior 
relationship: the importance of the attitude, its correspondence to behavior, its acces￾sibility, the presence of social pressures, and whether a person has direct experience
with the attitude.6
 Important attitudes reflect our fundamental values, self-interest, 
or identification with individuals or groups we value. These attitudes tend to show 
a strong relationship with our behavior. However, discrepancies between attitudes 
and behaviors tend to occur when social pressures to behave in certain ways hold 
exceptional power, as in most organizations. You are more likely to remember 
attitudes you frequently express, and attitudes that our memories can easily access 
are more likely to predict our behavior. The attitude-behavior relationship is also 
much stronger if an attitude refers to something we have directly experienced. 
Advancements in machine learning (see Chapter  1) have enabled researchers 
to further understand the attitude-behavior relationship. For example, using a 
machine learning algorithm enabled researchers in one study of hospital nurses 
to determine that their job attitudes were related to performance in certain con￾ditions, such as when their job responsibilities were clearly defined.7
However, there are some instances in which behavior might predict future 
attitudes. Did you ever notice how people change what they say so that it does 
not contradict what they do? For example, when people come forward to call 
out sexual harassment in their jobs, management and harassers alike will often 
minimize, ignore, or even aggressively justify their behavior.8
 Cases of attitude 
following behavior illustrate the effects of cognitive dissonance,
9
 contradictions 
individuals might perceive between their attitudes and their behavior.
People seek a stable consistency among their attitudes and between their 
attitudes and their behavior.10 Any form of inconsistency is uncomfortable, 
and individuals attempt to reduce or minimize it. When there is dissonance, 
people alter their attitudes or behavior to minimize the dissonance or develop 
a rationalization for the discrepancy. For example, university faculty members 
on strike found it difficult to accept their union’s recommendation to accept 
the university’s offer and return to work.11 Instead, they sought out additional 
information to justify their belief that the offer was unfair instead of accepting 
the offer outright.
No individual can avoid dissonance. You know texting while driving is unsafe. 
(There is research to prove it; do not try to justify your attitude or reduce your 
dissonance to get yourself out of this one!)12 Still, you do it anyway and convince 
yourself that nothing bad will happen. The desire to reduce dissonance depends 
on three factors: the importance of the elements creating dissonance, the degree of 
influence we believe we have over those elements, and the rewards of dissonance.13
cognitive dissonance Any incompatibility 
between two or more attitudes or between 
behavior and attitudes.
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 116 21/12/22 6:44 AMJob Attitudes CHAPTER 3 117
Individuals are more motivated to reduce dissonance when the attitudes are 
important or when they believe the dissonance is due to something they can con￾trol. Rewards accompanying dissonance tend to reduce tension inherent in the 
dissonance. (In other words, the dissonance is less distressing if accompanied by 
something good, such as a higher pay raise than expected.) Individuals are more 
motivated to reduce dissonance when the attitudes are important or when they 
believe the dissonance is due to something they can control.
Job Attitudes
We have thousands of attitudes, but organizational behavior (OB) focuses on 
a narrow set that forms positive or negative evaluations that employees hold 
about their work.
For instance, organizational identification, or the extent to which employ￾ees define themselves by the same characteristics that define their organization, 
forms a basis for which attitudes and behaviors are engendered.14 A review of 
hundreds of job attitude-behavior studies found that organizational identifica￾tion strongly predicted job attitude formation.15 Furthermore, drawing on arti￾ficial intelligence theory, some researchers have proposed that humans form 
attitudes similarly to how machines make predictions based on continuously 
incoming data. For example, employees may experience event (e.g., reduced 
pay) after event (e.g., downsizing) after event (e.g., canceled bonuses) while on 
the job. From these events, employees begin to “learn” that the organization 
may not value paying its employees well, begin to form negative attitudes toward 
the organization, and begin to disidentify.16
Organizational identification has become a hot topic in the Gig Economy. 
Contract and freelance workers engage in short-term agreements with multiple 
organizations and people who come and go over time. It might seem like these gig 
workers would probably develop little identification toward these organizations. 
However, recent research suggests that this might not be the case. If the work itself 
is personally fulfilling (e.g., provides a sense of autonomy and a chance to relate 
to other people), gig workers can identify with their contracting organizations.17

attitudes.
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 117 21/12/22 6:45 AM118 PART 2 The Individual
 Beyond organizational identification, most of the research has looked at 
three attitudes: job satisfaction, job involvement, and organizational commit￾ment. 18 Other critical attitudes include perceived organizational support (POS) 
and employee engagement. Before moving on to these primary attitudes, it is 
essential to note that OB is not solely focused on the link between positive job 
attitudes and desirable behaviors. As we will discuss later in the chapter, nega￾tive job attitudes and their outcomes are just as important. For instance, the 
effects of organizational identification are not all positive. 19 Organizational 
identification can lead employees to behave unethically on behalf of the orga￾nization (e.g., fudging numbers to make the organization look better), experi￾ence reduced performance, and perpetuate conflict between people. In fact, 
in one sample of thousands of White male corporate executives, organizational 
identification tends to decrease following a racial or gender minority CEO’s 
appointment. The White male executives, in turn, provide less help to their col￾leagues as a result of this disidentification. 
 Job Satisfaction and Job Involvement 
 When people speak of employee attitudes, they usually mean job satisfaction , a 
positive feeling about a job resulting from an evaluation of its characteristics. A 
person with high job satisfaction holds positive feelings about the work. In con￾trast, a person with low satisfaction holds negative feelings. Because job satisfaction 
is one of the most important attitudes, we will review this attitude in detail later. 
 job satisfaction A positive feeling about 
one’s job resulting from an evaluation of its 
characteristics. 
 An Ethical Choice 
 Office Talk 
Y
ou are working peacefully in 
your cubicle when your coworker 
invades your space, sitting on 
your desk and nearly overturning your 
coffee. As they talk about the morning 
meeting, do you 1) stop what you are 
doing and listen or 2) explain that you 
are in the middle of a project and ask 
to talk some other time? 
 Your answer may reflect your atti￾tude toward office talk, but it should 
be guided by whether your participation 
is ethical. Sometimes, office conver￾sations can help employees process 
information and find solutions to prob￾lems. Other times, office talk can 
be damaging to everyone. Consider 
the scenario from two perspectives: 
oversharing and venting. 
 More than 60 percent of 514 profes￾sional employees surveyed indicated 
that they encounter individuals who 
frequently share too much about them￾selves. Some are self-centered and nar￾cissistic and “think you want to know 
all the details of their lives,” according 
to psychologist Alan Hilfer. 
 Despite the drawbacks, oversharers 
can be strong contributors. Billy Bauer, 
director of marketing for manufacturer 
Royce Leather, is an oversharer who 
boasts about his latest sales—which 
may push other employees to work 
harder. Employees can also contribute 
to teamwork when they share personal 
stories related to organizational goals. 
 Now let’s look at this the other 
way. According to Yale professor Amy 
Wrzesniewski, some people are often 
“the first people to become offended” 
when it comes to office talk if they think 
the organization is making wrong deci￾sions. They can become emotional, 
challenging, and outspoken about their 
views. If they are not heard, they can 
increase their venting or withdraw. 
 Yet these people can be top￾performing employees: They are often 
highly engaged, inspiring, and strong 
team players who are more likely to 
work harder than others. Venting their 
frustrations helps restore a positive 
attitude to keep them high-performing. 
Research indicates that venting to 
coworkers can also build camaraderie. 
 Office conversations can quickly go 
awry if you do not pay attention to the 
situational norms, your role in the orga￾nization, the content of the discussion, 
and your own engagement in the conver￾sation. Although there are some topics 
that are obviously reprehensible and 
 off-limits, in general, there are no clear 
guidelines for what is and is not accept￾able office talk. So you must monitor your 
own conversations and become aware 
of when they start to feel like venting or 
oversharing, and whether you feel you 
should participate in the conversation at 
that point. Knowing who is approaching 
you for conversation, why they are com￾ing to you, what they may talk about, and 
how you may keep the discussion pro￾ductive and ethical can help you choose 
whether to engage or excuse yourself. 20
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 118 21/12/22 6:45 AMJob Attitudes CHAPTER 3 119
Related to job satisfaction is job involvement, the degree to which people psy￾chologically identify with their jobs and consider their perceived performance lev￾els important to their self-worth.21 Employees with high job involvement strongly 
identify with and care about the kind of work they do; as such, they tend to be 
more satisfied with their jobs.22 Another closely related concept is psychological 
empowerment, or employees’ beliefs in the degree to which they influence their 
work environment, competencies, meaningfulness of their job, and autonomy.23
The more “empowered” employees are, the more likely they are to perform well, 
engage in organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) (see Chapter 1), and be 
creative. (They are also less likely to intend to leave the organization.)24
Research suggests that psychological empowerment strongly predicts job 
attitudes and strain while it moderately predicts performance behaviors. 
A meta-analysis spanning forty-three studies and over 15,000 employees found 
that empowerment tended to be more predictive of these outcomes when 
considering all four beliefs (i.e., impact, competence, meaningfulness, and 
self-determination) together instead of each one separately. However, some 
evidence suggests that meaningfulness empowerment beliefs have a substantial 
effect on attitudes and strain, even after taking the other factors into account.
Organizational Commitment
An employee with strong organizational commitment identifies with their organiza￾tion and its goals and wishes to remain a member. Emotional attachment to an orga￾nization and belief in its values are the gold standard for employee commitment.25
OB scholars’ understanding of organizational commitment has evolved since its 
introduction. Traditionally, theorists considered commitment to be comprised of 
three components: affective, normative, and continuance commitment. Affective com￾mitment reflects emotional attachment to and involvement in an organization. 
Normative commitment reflects the sense of obligation an employee feels to an orga￾nization. Finally, continuance commitment reflects employees’ consideration of the 
costs of leaving an organization and a drive to continue as an employee.”26
Committed employees will be less likely to engage in work withdrawal (even if 
they are dissatisfied) because they feel loyal or attached to the organization, they do 
not have other options, or it would be difficult to leave.27 However, affective com￾mitment tends to be most important for outcomes beyond turnover and retention, 
like attendance, performance, and organizational citizenship behavior.28 Moreover, 
some criticize the three components and suggest that normative and continuance 
commitment are more like attitudes toward turnover (e.g., staying or leaving) than 
attitudes toward an organization.29 Regardless, even if employees are not currently 
happy with their work, they may decide to continue with the organization if they are 
committed enough. For example, during times of crisis (e.g., the Great Recession), 
employees may experience a substantial amount of job insecurity, leading them to 
experience less affective commitment toward their organizations.30 However, they 
would find leaving their organization difficult, considering the crisis’s tumultuous 
job market, and experience greater continuance commitment as a result.
OB scholars have continued to refine our understanding of organizational 
commitment over the previous decades.31 For instance, many have explored 
commitment as a psychological bond directed toward any given target.32 These 
targets could be an employee’s team, supervisor, coworkers, or any combina￾tion of such targets.33 Other research has looked at the pattern of employees’ 
individual affective, normative, and continuance commitment.34 Reviews have 
uncovered that employees tend to have either low, moderate, or high levels of 
commitment across all three types. Moreover, some employees have patterns 
characterized by only high affective or normative commitment relative to other 
forms. Notably, this research suggests that these patterns of commitment greatly 
influence organizational outcomes.35

Perceived Organizational Support
Perceived organizational support (POS) is the degree to which employees 
believe that the organization values their contributions and cares about their 
well-being. People perceive their organizations as supportive when they are 
treated fairly by other organization members, have a high-quality relation￾ship with the organization, and perceive their organization’s practices to be 
supportive, developmental, and fair.36 An excellent example is R&D engineer 
John Greene, whose POS is sky-high because CEO Marc Benioff and 350 fel￾low Salesforce.com employees covered all his medical expenses and stayed in 
touch with him throughout his recovery after he was diagnosed with leukemia. 
No doubt stories like this are part of why Salesforce.com was in the top ten of 
Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2020.37
POS is a predictor, but there are some cultural influences.38 POS is important 
in countries where the power distance, the degree to which people in a coun￾try accept that power in institutions and organizations is distributed unequally, 
is lower. In low-power-distance countries like the United States, people are 
more likely to view work as an exchange than a moral obligation. Employees 
in these countries look for reasons to feel supported by their organizations. It 
appears that U.S. organizations are obliging. One study of hundreds of thou￾sands of U.S. employees tracked over thirty years indicated that POS has been 
steadily increasing over the years.39 In high-power-distance countries like China, 
employee POS perceptions are not as deeply based on demonstrations of fair￾ness, support, and encouragement.40
Employee Engagement
Employee engagement is the degree of enthusiasm an employee feels for the 
job.41 Employee engagement, in many ways, represents a combination of atti￾tudes (e.g., satisfaction and commitment) but exceeds these, meaning some￾thing like “devotion” or giving your “heart and soul” to your work.42 Highly 
engaged employees have a passion for their work and feel a deep connection to 
their companies. Disengaged employees have essentially checked out, putting 
time but not energy or attention into their work. Engagement becomes a real 
concern for most organizations because disengaged employees cost organiza￾tions money—one study suggests that organizations can lose up to $550 billion 
annually in lost productivity.43 Employee engagement is related to job engage￾ment, which we discuss in detail in Chapter 7.
Engagement levels determine many measurable outcomes. Reviews of 
employee engagement suggest that employee engagement is moderately related to 
employee and organizational performance. A study of nearly 8,000 business units 
in thirty-six companies found that teams whose employees reported high engage￾ment levels achieved higher customer satisfaction levels, were more productive, 
brought in higher profits, and experienced lower levels of turnover and accidents 
than at other business units.44 Job engagement is also critical in times of crisis. 
For instance, following the COVID-19 outbreak, researchers studied employees 
in their return to work in the epicenter of the outbreak: Wuhan, China.45 These 
researchers found that job engagement was critical for reducing work withdrawal 
and increasing performance and even led to heightened safety compliance [e.g., 
the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when required].
Can organizations and managers do anything to improve employee engage￾ment? One meta-analysis suggests that the answer is yes.46 Particularly useful were 
employee-focused interventions that focused on increasing employees’ auton￾omy and resiliency, reduced job demands or made them easier to cope with, 
or contributed to employees’ development (e.g., feedback, learning). Another 
study of over one hundred publicly traded companies found that organizations 
perceived organizational support (POS) The 
degree to which employees believe an 
organization values their contribution and 
cares about their well-being.

M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 120 21/12/22 6:45 AMJob Attitudes CHAPTER 3 121
can improve engagement by enhancing organizational practices (e.g., train￾ing), work attributes (e.g., clarity in roles, autonomy), and supervisor support.47
There are several instances in which companies successfully improved employee 
engagement and, as such, experienced positive outcomes. For example, Molson 
Coors found engaged employees were five times less likely to have safety inci￾dents. When an accident did occur, it was much less severe and less costly for an 
engaged employee than for a disengaged one ($63 per incident versus $392). 
As another example, Caterpillar increased employee engagement and recorded 
a resulting 80 percent drop in grievances and a 34 percent increase in highly 
satisfied customers.48
Job Attitudes in the Gig Economy
The nature of work is changing rapidly with the emergence of the Gig Economy, as 
we discussed in Chapter 1. When we think of all of the job attitudes we discussed 
up until this point, it is safe to assume that the more contact we have with the orga￾nization, the more consistent our attitudes become. For instance, a janitor who has 
worked at a company for twenty years probably has much more stable levels of job 
attitudes than a newly hired custodian navigating their job probation period. But 
with many jobs switching to temporary, contingent, or contract positions, one must 
wonder whether people develop job attitudes in these positions at all.
Job attitudes in the Gig Economy appear to be influenced by a number of 
factors, including stability of the work, characteristics of the temporary assign￾ments, and the gig workers themselves.49 As discussed earlier with organizational 
identification, personally fulfilling work for gig workers in which they develop 
socioemotional relationships with clients and client organizations is critical.50
Furthermore, gig workers tend to be more satisfied with their jobs and more 
committed to the organizations they work with when they perceive employment 
to be stable and believe they can gain employment elsewhere fairly easily (if 
they had to).51 One meta-analysis of hundreds of thousands of workers suggests 
that gig workers’ job satisfaction is only slightly less than permanent workers.52
However, it is clear from the results that type of gig worker matters: Temporary 
agency workers do experience substantial decrements in job satisfaction com￾pared with other workers (including other gig workers). Similarly, temporary 
agency workers are also less committed to their organizations, their occupation, 
and their form of employment than permanent and self-employed individuals.53
With regard to other specific job attitudes, POS and organizational commitment 
have received the most attention. Returning to temporary agency workers, research 
has demonstrated that POS from the agency is critical for worker success in train￾ing, client perceptions of worker performance, and agency worker turnover and 
is even important for workers’ perceptions of organizational commitment.54 Like 
POS, commitment researchers have been fascinated with the idea that gig work￾ers can work with multiple organizations and develop distinct job attitudes toward 
each company they work with. Multiple organizations (e.g., clients and employment 
agencies) lead to multiple opportunities for commitment to be impacted. Here, 
justice and ethics seem to be key: gig workers’ perceptions of the organizations’ 
fairness, that the organizations are fulfilling their obligations to them, and that the 
organizations do not see them as lesser in status are critical in developing gig-worker 
commitment, encouraging OCB, and discouraging gig-worker turnover.55
Are These Job Attitudes All That Distinct?
Such promising findings for job attitudes such as employee engagement have earned 
them a following in many business organizations and management consulting firms. 
However, the concept generates active debate about its usefulness, partly because 
of the difficulty of separating it from related constructs. For example, some note 
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 121 21/12/22 6:45 AM122 PART 2 The Individual
that employee engagement has been used to refer at different times to various orga￾nizational phenomena, including psychological states, personality traits, and behav￾iors. They suggest, “The meaning of employee engagement is ambiguous among 
both academic researchers and among practitioners who use it in conversations with 
clients.” Another reviewer called engagement “an umbrella term for whatever one 
wants it to be.”56 Another study found that many of the survey questions used to mea￾sure employee engagement are similar to those found in satisfaction, commitment, 
and involvement measures.57 Other meta-analytic research suggests that the relation￾ship between employee engagement and job attitudes is extremely strong, leading 
one to question whether they are measuring distinct concepts.58 For the most part, 
research suggests that employee engagement predicts essential outcomes. For the 
most part, however, the amassed work to date calls into question how distinct it is 
from other job attitudes. Thus, there is still work to be done.
You might wonder whether job attitudes are, in fact, distinct. Indeed, 
there is some distinctiveness among job attitudes, and they can be reliably 
differentiated. However, suppose people feel like their work is central to 
their being (high job involvement) and identify strongly with their organi￾zation (high organizational identification). Isn’t it probable that they like 
it too (high job satisfaction)? Won’t people who think their organization is 
supportive also feel committed to it (strong organizational commitment)? 
Evidence suggests these attitudes are highly related, as mentioned in the 
prior section. They overlap significantly for various reasons, including the 
employee’s personality. Generally, if you know someone’s job satisfaction lev￾els, you know most of what you need to know about how that person sees the 
organization. Next, we will consider the implications of job satisfaction and 
then job dissatisfaction.
Job Satisfaction
We have already discussed job satisfaction briefly. We know that it is one of the 
most critical job attitudes and predicts several important business outcomes. 
Now let’s dissect the concept more carefully. If I am a manager and I want 
to get a better idea of how satisfied the people in my organization are, how 
do I measure job satisfaction? What causes an employee to have a high level 
of job satisfaction? How do satisfied employees affect an organization? Before 
you answer these questions, a look at the list of worst jobs for job satisfaction 
(Exhibit 3-2) may give you some indications. You may be surprised that they are 
not all low-paying jobs.
How Do I Measure Job Satisfaction?
Our definition of job satisfaction—a positive feeling about a job resulting from 
an evaluation of its characteristics—is broad. Yet that breadth is appropriate. 
A job is more than just shuffling papers, writing programming code, waiting 
on customers, or driving a truck. Jobs require interacting with coworkers and 
bosses, following organizational rules and policies, navigating organizational 
hierarchies, meeting performance standards, coping with less-than-ideal working 
conditions, adapting to new technology, and so forth. An employee’s assessment 
of satisfaction with the job is a complex summation of many discrete elements. 
How, then, do we measure it?
Two approaches are popular. The single global rating is a response to one 
question, such as “All things considered, how satisfied are you with your job?” 
Respondents circle a number between 1 and 5 on a scale from “highly satis￾fied” to “highly dissatisfied.” The second method, the summation of job facets, 
3-4 Identify the two approaches 
for measuring job 
satisfaction.
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 122 21/12/22 6:45 AMJob Attitudes CHAPTER 3 123
is more sophisticated. It identifies key elements in a job, such as the type of 
work, skills needed, supervision, present pay, promotion opportunities, culture, 
and relationships with coworkers. Respondents rate each of these on a standard￾ized scale (e.g., from 1 to 5, “dissatisfied” to “satisfied”). These ratings are then 
added to create an overall job satisfaction score.
Is one of these approaches superior? Summing up responses to several job 
factors seems, based on one’s intuition, likely to achieve a more accurate evalu￾ation of job satisfaction. Research does not entirely support this approach, how￾ever.59 This is one of those rare instances in which simplicity seems to work as well 
as complexity, making one method essentially as valid as the other. Both meth￾ods can be helpful. The single global rating method is not very time-consuming, 
while the summation of job facets helps managers zero in on problems and deal 
with them faster and more accurately.
How Satisfied Are People in Their Jobs?
Are most people satisfied with their jobs? You may want to consider the OB Poll 
before you answer. Job satisfaction levels can remain relatively consistent over time. 
For instance, U.S. average job satisfaction levels were consistently high from 1972 
to 2006.60 However, economic conditions tend to influence job satisfaction rates. 
In late 2007, the Great Recession precipitated a drop-off in job satisfaction; the 
lowest point was in 2010, when 42.6 percent of U.S. workers reported satisfaction 
with their jobs.61 Approximately 51 percent of U.S. workers reported satisfaction 
with their jobs in 2017.62 However, the rebound was still far off from the 1987 
level of 61.1 percent.63 Job satisfaction rates tend to vary in different cultures 
worldwide. Of course, there are always competing measurements that offer alter￾native viewpoints.
The facets of job satisfaction levels can vary widely. As shown in Exhibit 3-3, 
people have typically been more satisfied with their jobs overall, the work itself, 
and their supervisors and coworkers than they have been with their pay and 
promotion opportunities.

What Causes Job Satisfaction?
3-5 Summarize the main 
causes of job satisfaction.
Think about the best job you have ever had. What made it great? The reasons 
can differ significantly. Let’s discuss some characteristics that likely influence 
job satisfaction, starting with job conditions.
Job Conditions
Generally, interesting jobs that provide training, variety, independence, and 
control satisfy most employees. Interdependence, feedback, social support, and 
interaction with coworkers outside the workplace are also strongly related to 
job satisfaction, even after accounting for the work’s characteristics.65 It goes 
without saying that toxic work environments lead to dissatisfied employees. For 
example, if you experience workplace racial discrimination, you are likely to 
become dissatisfied (and some research suggests you might even experience a 
decline in physical and psychological health).66
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 125 21/12/22 6:45 AM126 PART 2 The Individual
As you may have guessed, managers also play a big role in employees’ job 
satisfaction. One review of nearly 70,000 employees from twenty-three countries 
found that the quality of exchange between the leaders and their employees is 
more strongly related to job satisfaction in more individualistic (e.g., Western) 
cultures than it is in more collectivistic (e.g., Asian) cultures.67 Furthermore, 
“fitting in” matters for job attitudes worldwide. Another review of over one hun￾dred studies in East Asia, Europe, and North America suggests that fitting in 
with your organization and job matters more in North America, whereas fitting 
in with your team or supervisor matters more in East Asia.68
Thus, job conditions—especially the intrinsic nature of the work itself, social 
interactions, and supervision—are important predictors of job satisfaction. 
Managers would do well to make sure the job conditions are satisfying enough 
to make employees happy. For example, HubSpot is listed as the number one 
best place to work in 2020, according to Glassdoor: one employee reemphasizes 
the value of DEI, noting that “HubSpot works hard to create a truly diverse and 
inclusive work environment where everyone can feel comfortable bringing their 
true selves to work.”69
Personality and Individual Differences
As crucial as job conditions are to job satisfaction, personality also plays an 
important role.70 People who have positive core self-evaluations (CSEs); see 
the chapter on personality and individual differences for further discussion—
who believe in their inner worth and basic competence—are more satisfied 
with their jobs than people with negative CSEs. For those in collectivist cul￾tures, those with high CSEs may realize particularly high job satisfaction.71
Other individual characteristics matter for job satisfaction as well. For 
instance, research suggests that intelligent people tend to be more satisfied 
with their jobs, primarily because they seek out complex jobs that satisfy their 
intellectual curiosity.72 Fit between the person and the job matters, too. One 
meta-analysis of research spanning sixty-five years demonstrated that people 
are more satisfied when their interests (e.g., a desire to make art) match their 
jobs (e.g., artist).73
Employee engagement is high at 
Baptist Health of South Florida, where 
employees share a serious commit￾ment to patient care and are passion￾ate about the work they do. Looking 
at an electrocardiogram (EKG) read￾out, hospital employees Yaima Millan 
and Marvin Rosete feel their work is 
meaningful and can make a differ￾ence in patients’ lives.

Pay
You have probably noticed that pay comes up often when people discuss job 
satisfaction. People often talk about whether they are satisfied with their pay, 
even comparing their income with other people’s incomes (e.g., peers or the 
typical person who does their job). Income does correlate with job satisfaction 
and overall happiness for many people, and people do experience decrements 
in job satisfaction when they detect discrepancies with others.74 Still, the effect 
(of both pay level and discrepancies with others) can be smaller once an indi￾vidual reaches a standard level of comfortable living.75 Look at Exhibit 3-5. It 
shows the relationship between the average pay for a job and the average job 
satisfaction level. As you can see, there is not much of a relationship. Money 
does motivate people, as we will discover in Chapter 8. But what motivates us is 
not necessarily the same as what makes us happy.
Outcomes of Job Satisfaction
3-6 Identify four outcomes of 
job satisfaction.
Having discussed some of the causes of job satisfaction, we now turn to specific 
outcomes.
Job Performance
As several studies have concluded, happy workers are more likely to be produc￾tive workers. Some researchers believed the relationship between job satisfac￾tion and job performance was a myth, but a review of 300 studies suggested the 
correlation is quite robust.76 Individuals with higher job satisfaction perform 
better, and organizations with more satisfied employees tend to be more effec￾tive than those with fewer.

 Toward a Better World 
 Nvidians: Together Transforming Communities Around the World 
 Do employees care if their employers 
do anything to make a difference in the 
world? We often think about the impact 
employer corporate social responsi￾bility, philanthropy, and sustainability 
have on the planet—but what about 
a company’s own people and their job 
attitudes? 
 Nvidia, a Fortune 500 semicon￾ductor manufacturer, plays a trans￾formative role in the lives of Nvidians 
through their shared work to make 
the world a better place. Nvidia is 
an excellent example of how social 
responsibility can be woven into an 
organization’s fabric. However, what 
makes Nvidia unique is the degree to 
which it includes employees in this 
mission. Employees at Nvidia appear 
to share the same propensity toward 
helping others (leading to organiza￾tional identification), strongly identify 
with their work (leading to job involve￾ment), and—most importantly—feel 
empowered to make a difference in 
their communities. 
 For instance, Nvidia has one of 
the business world’s only employee￾run philanthropic foundations. Also, 
it holds a massive annual volunteer 
event in place of a holiday party. This 
event, which it has named Project 
Inspire, results in a turnout of thou￾sands of Nvidians, tens of thousands 
of volunteer hours, and millions of dol￾lars in donations annually. Discontent 
with holding Project Inspire as an 
annual event, Nvidians introduced a 
new initiative, Inspire 365, empower￾ing employees with the flexibility to 
make any day a Project Inspire day. 
Nvidia offers its employees year￾round gift matching and the flextime 
to volunteer, freeing Nvidians to flex￾ibly address community needs and 
really take ownership of the process. 
As some examples, this flexibility has 
helped enable the Techsplorer pro￾gram, empowering Nvidians to tutor 
and inspire children and familiarize 
them with artificial intelligence. In the 
wake of COVID-19, this program has 
also encouraged employees to per￾form more than 23,000 small actions 
to combat the pandemic in their own 
communities (with 100 percent of its 
offices participating globally). These 
actions appear to have had a strong 
effect on job attitudes. With 95  per￾cent of Nvidians responding, one 
survey found that 96  percent agree 
that they are making a difference glob￾ally, and 90 percent agreed that Nvidia 
was a great place to work. 
 Although Nvidia is an excellent case 
of how organizations can genuinely 
involve and empower employees to 
make the world a better place, what 
about organizations that do not follow 
through with their promises? Sadly, 
Nvidia appears to be an exception 
rather than the rule. In one study of 
organizations’ values and whether they 
actually live up to those values across 
500 organizations, the researchers 
found no relationship between the two. 
Research demonstrates that when orga￾nizations exhibit a disconnect between 
what they say and what they actually do, 
employees may pick up on this, which 
can harm organizational identification 
and job attitudes. On the other hand, 
as we see from Nvidia, research sug￾gests that organizations that put what 
they say into action increase employ￾ees’ respect and pride in their organi￾zations, lead them to engage in OCBs, 
and form a collective effort to make the 
world a better place. 77
 Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) 
 It seems logical that job satisfaction should be a substantial determinant of an 
employee’s organizational citizenship behavior (known as OCB or citizenship 
behavior ; see Chapter  1). 78 OCBs include people talking positively about their 
organizations, helping others, and going beyond their jobs’ typical expectations. 
Evidence suggests job satisfaction is moderately correlated with OCB; people 
who are more satisfied with their jobs are more likely to engage in citizenship 
behavior. 79
 Why does job satisfaction lead to OCB? One reason is trust. Research in 18 
countries suggests that managers reciprocate employees’ OCB with trusting 
behaviors of their own. 80 Individuals who feel that their coworkers support them 
are also more likely to engage in helpful behaviors than those with antagonistic 
coworker relationships. 81

Service firms like Air Canada under￾stand that satisfied employees in￾crease customer satisfaction and loy￾alty. As frontline employees who have 
regular customer contact, the airline’s 
ticket agents are friendly, upbeat, and 
responsive while greeting passengers 
and helping them with luggage check￾in and seat assignments.

Customer Satisfaction
Because customer satisfaction is a critical outcome in the service industry, it is 
reasonable to ask whether employee satisfaction is related to positive customer 
outcomes. For employees with regular customer contact, the answer appears 
to be yes. Satisfied employees appear to increase customer satisfaction and 
loyalty.82
Several companies are acting on this evidence. Online shoe retailer Zappos 
is so committed to finding customer service employees who are satisfied with 
the job that it offers a $2,000 bribe to quit the company after training. The 
logic is that the least satisfied will take the cash and go.83 Zappos employees 
are empowered to “create fun and a little weirdness” to ensure that customers 
are satisfied, and it works: Of the company’s more than 24 million customers, 
75  percent are repeat buyers. For Zappos, employee satisfaction has a direct 
effect on customer satisfaction.
Life Satisfaction
Until now, we have treated job satisfaction as if it were separate from life satis￾faction, but they may be more related than you think.84 Furthermore, life sat￾isfaction decreases when people become unemployed, according to research 
in Germany, not just because of income loss.85 For most individuals, work is an 
integral part of life, and many people derive meaning from the roles they ful￾fill.86 Therefore, it makes sense that our overall happiness depends in no small 
part on our happiness in our work (our job satisfaction).
The Impact of Job Dissatisfaction
3-7 Identify four employee 
responses to job 
dissatisfaction.
What happens when employees dislike their jobs? One theoretical model—the 
exit–voice–loyalty–neglect framework—helps us understand the consequences 
of dissatisfaction. Exhibit 3-6 illustrates employees’ four responses to job dis￾satisfaction, which differ along two dimensions: constructive/destructive and 
active/passive. The responses are as follows:87
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 129 21/12/22 6:45 AM130 PART 2 The Individual
• Exit. The exit response directs behavior toward leaving the organization, in￾cluding looking for a new position or resigning. To measure the effects of 
this response to dissatisfaction, researchers study individual terminations 
and collective turnover, the total loss to the organization of employee knowl￾edge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics.88
• Voice. The voice response includes actively and constructively attempting to 
improve conditions, including suggesting improvements, discussing prob￾lems with superiors, and undertaking union activity.
• Loyalty. The loyalty response means passively but optimistically waiting for 
conditions to improve, including speaking up for the organization in the 
face of external criticism and trusting the organization and its manage￾ment to “do the right thing.”
• Neglect. The neglect response passively allows conditions to worsen and in￾cludes chronic absenteeism or lateness, reduced effort, and an increased 
error rate.
Exit and neglect behaviors are linked to performance variables such as 
productivity, absenteeism, and turnover. But this model expands employee 
responses to include voice and loyalty—constructive behaviors that allow indi￾viduals to tolerate unpleasant situations or improve working conditions. The 
model helps us understand employee responses in various situations. For 
instance, union members often express dissatisfaction through the grievance 
procedure or formal contract negotiations. These voice mechanisms allow them 
to continue in their jobs while acting to improve the situation.
As helpful as this framework is, it is quite general. We next address behav￾ioral responses to job dissatisfaction.
Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB)
Substance abuse, stealing at work, endless scrolling on social media while 
on the clock, gossip, absenteeism, and tardiness are examples of destructive 
behaviors to organizations. They are indicators of a broader syndrome called 
counterproductive work behavior (CWB), also termed deviant behavior in 
the workplace or simply employee withdrawal (see Chapter 1).

behavior directed toward leaving the

behaviors we have discussed, CWB does not just happen—the behaviors 
often follow negative and sometimes long-standing attitudes. Therefore, if 
we can identify the predictors of CWB, we may lessen the probability of its 
effects.
Generally, job dissatisfaction predicts CWB.90 People who are not satisfied 
with their work become frustrated, which lowers their performance91 and makes 
them more prone to CWB.92 However, some research also suggests that this rela￾tionship might be stronger for men than for women, as men tend to exhibit 
more aggressiveness and less impulse control.93 Our immediate social envi￾ronment also matters. One German study suggests that we are nudged toward 
CWB by our work environment’s norms. For example, individuals in teams with 
high absenteeism are more likely to be absent themselves.94 CWB can also be a 
response to abusive supervision from managers, which then increases the abuse, 
thus starting a vicious cycle.95
One crucial point about CWB is that dissatisfied employees often choose 
one or more specific behaviors due to idiosyncratic factors. One worker might 
quit. Another might use work time to browse social media or take work sup￾plies home for personal use. In short, workers who do not like their jobs 
“get even” in various ways. Because those ways can be quite creative, control￾ling only one behavior with policies and punishments leaves the root cause 
untouched. Employers should seek to correct the source of the problem—the 
dissatisfaction—rather than try to control the different responses.
According to some research, sometimes CWB is an emotional reaction to 
perceived unfairness—a way to try to restore an employee’s sense of equity 
exchange.96 Therefore, CWB has complex ethical implications. For example, 
is someone who takes a box of markers home from the office for their children 
acting ethically? Some people consider this stealing. Others may want to look 
at moderating factors such as the employee’s contribution to the organization 
before they decide. Does the person generously give extra time and effort to the 
organization with little thanks or compensation? If so, they might see CWB as 
part of an attempt to “even the score.”
As a manager, you can take steps to mitigate CWB. For instance, you can 
poll employee attitudes, identify areas for workplace improvement, and 
attempt to measure CWB. Several reviews suggest that self-assessments of CWB 
can be just as useful as reports from coworkers or supervisors, partly because 
of differences in the observability of CWB.97 Creating strong teams, integrating 
supervisors within them, providing formalized team policies, and introducing 
team-based incentives may help lower the CWB “contagion” that reduces the 
group’s standards.98
Absenteeism We find that unsatisfied employees tend to be absent more often, 
but the relationship is not very strong.99 Generally, when numerous alterna￾tive jobs are available, dissatisfied employees have high absence rates, but when 
there are few alternatives, dissatisfied employees have the same (low) rate of 
absence as satisfied employees.100 Another factor is how guilty you would feel 
if you were absent; one study of customer service agents found that employees 
who were more prone to feeling guilty were less likely to be absent.101
Turnover The relationship between job satisfaction and turnover is stronger 
than between satisfaction and absenteeism.102 Overall, a pattern of lowered 
job satisfaction is the best predictor of turnover. Turnover also has a workplace 
environment connection too. If most of the other employees in the immedi￾ate workplace are also dissatisfied, there may be a contagion effect. This sug￾gests that managers should consider job satisfaction (and turnover) patterns of 
coworkers when assigning workers to a new area.103

 Myth or Science? 
 Happy Workers Means Happy Profits 
 T
here are exceptions, of course, 
but this statement is basically 
 correct. A glance at Fortune’s 
Best Companies to Work For list, where 
 companies are chosen by the happi￾ness inducements they provide, reveals 
recognizable profit leaders: Hilton, SAS, 
Edward Jones, and REI, to name a few. 
However, all happiness is not created 
equal. 
 An employee who is happy because 
their coworker did most of the work on 
their team’s project is not necessar￾ily going to work harder, for instance. 
Some happiness-inducers also seem 
unrelated to profit increases, such as 
Google’s bowling alley and Salesforce.
com ’ s off-the-charts parties. Traditional 
benefits programs also do not neces￾sarily yield higher job satisfaction, 
productivity, and profits. Research indi￾cates that employees highly value paid 
time off, a retirement plan such as a 
401(k), and lower health premiums. But 
many companies offer these benefits 
and are nowhere near the Fortune 500 
organizations in profits. 
 It turns out that the value of keep￾ing happiness in the profit equation 
may be felt in the level of employee 
engagement. As Julie Gebauer, a 
managing director for consulting firm 
Towers Watson, said, “It’s not just 
about making them happy—that’s not 
a business issue. Engagement is.” Job 
engagement “represents employees’ 
commitment . . . and the level of dis￾cretionary effort they are willing to put 
forth at work,” wrote Jack in the Box’s 
Executive VP Mark Blankenship. Happy 
employees with higher job engagement 
are willing to work hard, make custom￾ers happy, and stay with the company—
three factors that affect the bottom 
line in a big way. Conversely, a review 
of 300 studies revealed that turnover 
rates resulting from poor attitudes or 
low engagement led to poorer organiza￾tional performance. 
 So the moral of the story seems to 
be this: Treat others as we want to be 
treated in the workplace. It is just good 
business. 104
 The satisfaction–turnover relationship is affected by alternative job pros￾pects. If an employee accepts an unsolicited job offer, job dissatisfaction was 
less predictive of turnover because the employee more likely left in response to 
“pull” (the lure of the other job) than “push” (the unattractiveness of the cur￾rent job). Similarly, job dissatisfaction is more likely to translate into turnover 
when other employment opportunities are plentiful. Likewise, even employees 
who are satisfied with their jobs may be more likely to leave when there are 
high amounts of job insecurity. 105 When employees have high “human capital” 
(high education, high ability), job dissatisfaction is more likely to translate into 
turnover because they have, or perceive, many available alternatives. 106 
 Some factors help break the dissatisfaction–turnover relationship. Employees’ 
embeddedness —connections to the job and community 107 —can help lower the 
probability of turnover, particularly in collectivist (group-oriented) cultures. 108
Embedded employees seem less likely to want to consider alternative job pros￾pects. This is because embedded employees are motivated to protect the resources 
they have acquired as a result of their attachment to the job, organization, 
or community. 109 However, if employees are embedded in a toxic environment, 
they may feel “stuck” in a negative situation, which can have adverse conse￾quences for physical and psychological health. 110 
 Managers Often “Don’t Get It” 
 Given the evidence we have just reviewed, it should come as no surprise 
that job satisfaction can affect the bottom line. One study by a management 
consulting firm separated large organizations into high morale (more than 
70  percent of employees expressed overall job satisfaction) and medium 
or low morale (fewer than 70 percent) groups. Companies’ stock prices in 
the high-morale group grew 19.4 percent compared with 10 percent for the 
M03_ROBB0025_19_GE_C03.indd 132 21/12/22 6:45 AMJob Attitudes CHAPTER 3 133
medium- or low-morale group. Furthermore, companies listed within the “100 
Best Companies to Work for in America” generated 2.3 to 3.8 percent higher 
stock returns annually than other firms during the 1984 to 2011 range.111
Despite these results, many managers are unconcerned about employee job 
satisfaction.
Others overestimate how satisfied employees are, so they do not think 
there is a problem when there is. In one study of 262 large employers, 
86 percent of senior managers believed their organizations treated employ￾ees well, but only 55  percent of employees agreed; another study found 
that 55 percent of managers thought morale was good in their organization 
compared to only 38 percent of employees.112 Regular surveys can reduce 
gaps between what managers think employees feel and what they really feel. 
A gap in understanding can affect the bottom line in small franchise sites 
and large companies. As manager of a KFC restaurant in Houston, Jonathan 
McDaniel surveyed his employees every three months. Some results led 
him to make changes, such as giving employees greater say about which 
workdays they had off. However, McDaniel believed the process itself was 
valuable. “They really love giving their opinions,” he said. “That’s the most 
important part of it—that they have a voice and that they’re heard.” Surveys 
are no panacea, but if job attitudes are as important as we believe, organiza￾tions need to use every reasonable method to find out how job attitudes can 
be improved.113
Summary
Managers should be interested in their employees’ attitudes because attitudes 
influence behavior and indicate potential problems. Creating a satisfied work￾force is hardly a guarantee of successful organizational performance, but evi￾dence strongly suggests that managers’ efforts to improve employee attitudes 
will likely result in positive outcomes, including greater organizational effec￾tiveness, higher customer satisfaction, and increased profits.
Implications for Managers
● Of the major job attitudes—job satisfaction, job involvement, organi￾zational commitment, POS, and employee engagement—remember 
that an employee’s job satisfaction level is the best single predictor of 
behavior.
● Pay attention to your employees’ job satisfaction levels as determinants of 
their performance, turnover, absenteeism, and withdrawal behaviors.
● Measure employee job attitudes at regular intervals to determine how em￾ployees are reacting to their work.
● To raise employee satisfaction, evaluate the fit between each employee’s 
work interests and the intrinsic parts of the job; then create work that is 
challenging and interesting to the individual.
● Consider the fact that high pay alone is unlikely to create a satisfying work 
environment.

 Earning That Promotion May Be Key to Higher Job Satisfaction 
POINT 
 Who would not want to be promoted? Promotions usually 
mean higher pay, greater job autonomy, and authority. As one 
of the facets of the Job Descriptive Index (JDI), opportuni￾ties for promotion are in fact linked to job satisfaction. Not only does 
research show that a promotion can have the same positive impact on 
job satisfaction as a 69 percent increase in wages, even just believing 
you may receive a promotion can have an even stronger effect on job 
satisfaction. These findings may have a significant impact on reducing 
turnover as research shows that job satisfaction is a key predictor of 
whether an employee decides to leave or stay in a position. 
 Likewise, individuals who believed a promotion was possible in 
the next two years were more likely to remain at the same organi￾zation. More and more employees, particularly millennials and Gen 
Xers, consider career advancement opportunities to be important to 
job satisfaction. While people often associate higher pay with higher 
employee satisfaction, pay is not as important as other facets of job 
satisfaction. In fact, dissatisfied workers have been found more likely 
to cite a lack of advancement opportunities rather than low pay as 
a reason for job dissatisfaction. A great example of the impact of 
promotions and advancement opportunities is Bain & Company, an 
organization consistently ranked among the best places to work. The 
company has also been ranked among the top ten companies for 
working mothers, attributing this ranking to the sponsorship and train￾ing programs geared toward helping women to advance and achieve 
their professional goals. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 Y
 es, opportunities for promotion can lead to higher job satisfac￾tion, but of the five facets of the JDI, it is not the most predic￾tive. Furthermore, a recent study of 2,500 U.S. workers found 
that job security and the work environment were most important to job 
satisfaction. More specifically, coworkers and immediate supervisors 
influenced the job satisfaction of more than half of those surveyed. In 
addition, even in the cases when promotions have a positive impact 
on job satisfaction, any positive effect soon fades away within three to 
four years after the promotion is received. 
 There is even some research that points to gender differences in 
job satisfaction after a promotion. Results from these studies sup￾port the “glass-ceiling” hypothesis that not only is it more difficult 
for women to attain management positions, but women face greater 
obstacles as they are promoted to upper-management positions. If 
organizations are serious about closing the gender gap in managerial 
representation, investigating gender differences in job satisfaction is 
key, specifically focusing on individuals who are promoted to upper 
and lower managerial levels. Moreover, when developing gender￾inclusive practices, organizations often propose solutions such as 
more work flexibility and promotion opportunities. However, as the 
research demonstrates, a promotion may not be enough. Getting to 
the top may just be half the battle, as women may encounter push￾back with others questioning their authority and minimizing their 
contributions. 
 Regardless of gender, employees may also find that a promotion 
does not match their expectations. A new role may mean greater author￾ity and higher pay. On the other hand, it may also mean more hours than 
expected, and the increase in pay may not be enough to make up for the 
demands of the job. Thus, it should not be assumed that promotions will 
necessarily lead to more satisfied and fulfilled employees. 114

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
Job satisfaction, job involvement, employee engagement, 
organizational commitment, and perceived organization￾al support all affect how you, your coworkers, and your 
boss behave and perform in the workplace. First, the job 
attitudes of your work unit also affect the bottom line—
attitudes affect customer service and sales performance. 
Second, job attitudes and satisfaction can be assessed in a 
variety of ways to keep a “pulse” on the workforce of your 
organization. Third, knowledge of what causes job attitudes 
and the consequences/outcomes of job attitudes can help 
you set policies, practices, and procedures (when you are 
in a supervisory position) or engage in behaviors (if you 
are an employee) that will help you improve attitudes in 
your workplace. In this chapter, you improved your critical 
thinking skills and considered various situations relevant 
to social responsibility in the workplace, including wheth￾er happy workers lead to improved profit margins, how 
organizations can increase organizational identification 
through empowerment the pitfalls and benefits of office 
gossip and venting, and whether promotions matter for 
job satisfaction. In the following section, you will contin￾ue to improve your critical thinking skills and apply your 
knowledge about job attitudes to managing political views 
in the office, examine the ethics of employee tell-all web￾sites, consider the decision small business owners had to 
make in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and evalu￾ate carefully how several large organizations improve their 
employees’ job satisfaction.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Managing Political Views in the Office
Students should be divided into pairs, assigned to the role 
of either the supervisor or employee, and given their re￾spective role instructions. After students are given a few 
minutes to read through their role instructions, tell stu￾dents they should now engage in a role play, doing their 
best to adopt the role to which they have been assigned 
(approximately 10 to 15 minutes).
Supervisor Role Instructions
You are a supervisor of a team that you have noticed 
has conflicting political views. While you refrain from 
sharing your own political views or engaging in politi￾cal discussions in the workplace, you have noticed that 
one employee in particular frequently initiates these 
conversations. While it does not appear that the employee 
is misusing their time, as the conversations usually take 
place during breaks, you believe that it is making some 
employees uncomfortable. You decide it is time to sit 
down with the employee and have a one-on-one conver￾sation. It is up to your discretion whether you decide to 
not allow any political discussions or choose a different 
approach.
Employee Instructions
You are an employee who has been working at your 
current company for two years. During that time, you 
have developed close relationships with the other in￾dividuals on your five-person work team. You would 
consider yourself to be politically active and passionate 
about politics. Although you have conversations about 
politics at work, you are careful to only have these dur￾ing breaks to ensure they do not interfere with your 
work. Some of the other individuals on your team are 
also passionate about politics, so you do not see an 
issue with these discussions, particularly as the conver￾sations are, for the most part, civil and respectful. As a 
result, you are surprised when your supervisor requests 
to meet with you.
When students have completed the role-play exer￾cise, have them discuss the following questions. Lastly, as 
a whole class, have at least a few students share their re￾sponses to the debrief questions.
Questions
3-8. If you were playing the role of the supervisor, how 
did you address the situation? What factors 
influenced how you handled the situation?
3-9. If you were playing the role of the employee, how 
did you respond during the conversation with 
your supervisor? Did you agree with how the su￾pervisor handled the situation? Why or why not?

ETHICAL DILEMMA Tell-All Websites
“Arrogant, condescending, mean-spirited, hateful... and 
those traits describe the nicest people at Netflix,” writes 
one anonymous employee. “Management is awful... 
good old boys club,” writes a Coca-Cola market develop￾ment manager. And the reviews keep rolling in; Coca￾Cola has 5,700 employee reviews, and some companies, 
like Google, have more than double that number on 
Glassdoor, one of the Internet sites that allows anyone to 
rate their employers.
Websites like Glassdoor are thriving; employees increas￾ingly join the forums and seem to relish the chance to 
speak freely. Glassdoor is useful for both employers and 
employees as they are empowered to express their opinions 
and any concerns while employers can utilize Glassdoor as 
a monitoring tool. Valuable ratings and feedback can be 
utilized to inform organizational decision-making, learn￾ing and development, and company culture.
Organizations are aware that people watch what they 
say when they can be identified, and many have used 
anonymous job attitude surveys for this reason. Still, evalu￾ations from these surveys are often more glowing, and less 
detailed, than anonymous website feedback. Some orga￾nizations have therefore altered the frequency and scope 
of surveys to obtain more depth. Others have their own 
intranet platforms to solicit concerns and complaints.
Beyond the ethicality of posting reviews online—
details that you might not share in person—issues of 
organizational ethics come into play. While companies 
like Visa, Boeing, and Hewlett-Packard have tried to dis￾courage employees from anonymously venting on web￾sites and apps, such mandates may violate the employees’ 
right of free speech. And how anonymous are anonymous 
posts? Posts on Glassdoor and other forums eliminate a 
person’s name, but might supervisors be able to deter￾mine which subordinate posted the comments on occa￾sion, and perhaps even retaliate?
Grant Gochnauer, cofounder of a digital marketing 
agency in Chicago, has been successful in obtaining can￾did answers from his employees through polls taken sev￾eral times each week. “It’s sometimes a little bit scary,” he 
said, asking himself, “Do I really want to know the answer 
to this?”
Questions
3-10. Do you think employees have a right to say what 
they want to about their organizations online as 
opposed to in private?
3-11. How would you react if you learned one of your 
employees posted unflattering comments about 
you as a manager? Would your reaction be any 
different if the employee posted unflattering 
comments about you as a person?
3-12. Do you feel it is acceptable to post comments 
anonymously, or do you think people should 
include their names? Why or why not?115
CASE INCIDENT Jobs, Money, and Satisfaction
When two caretaker jobs were advertised on the tiny island 
of Great Blasket, Ireland’s most westerly point, there was no 
shortage of interest; it drew responses from applicants from 
Alaska to South Africa. But this was no high-paying job on a 
luxury resort island. The position was described as intense 
and tough, with no electricity, Wi-Fi, or hot showers, and life 
described as “back to basics,” involving candles, stoves, wild￾life, and nature. The posts included free accommodation 
and food, but it is unlikely the applicants were particularly 
interested in the pay or benefits. The previous post holders 
had left jobs in Dublin and a demanding work commute for 
what they considered their dream job. No doubt many of 
the applicants also saw it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
Of a like mind as those applicants for the caretaker 
jobs, Elsa was a high-flying executive who discovered 
that she had more important priorities in life than 
money. At the end of yet another late and stressful night 
working as an investment banker, she finally decided 
there was more to life. Elsa quit her job of 20 years, and 
six months later she was teaching in a primary school. 
“I feel refreshed,” she said. “I love teaching, genuinely 
enjoy my work and have had more holidays in the last 
year than I managed in the previous ten.” As for money, 
Elsa earns less than one quarter of what she used to as 
an investment banker.
It’s not just in the pursuit of dream jobs where people 
are willing to forgo money. One study reported that 49 
percent of the 2,000 employees it surveyed were prepared 
to take a reasonable pay cut for a more flexible work sched￾ule. Fifty-six percent said they would take a pay cut for 
better health benefits. Another report collected data from 
German, French, UK, and U.S. employees and found that 
those who were happy with their jobs cited meaningful 
work—not compensation—as the most important factor.

It seems millennials may even sacrifice money simply to 
get a better job title. The CEO of an employment agency 
claimed she had seen millennial candidates forgo nearly 
€10,000 in salary for what they consider a more valuable 
title.
But Peter Weber, an industrial designer, makes an in￾teresting point: “There is no way I could consider taking 
a pay cut. I have a family to take care of and bills to pay. 
It’s only a choice for people who already have enough 
money.” Money may not be everything in life, but it is
something.116

didn’t like or your dream job that paid compara￾tively little, which would you choose, and why?

 BRINGING YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR TO WORK 
Southwest Airlines is known for its distinctive, unconventional culture. 
Apart from its unique ways of doing things, Southwest Airlines also 
prioritizes its employees. The company’s philosophy is that employees will 
treat customers well if they are also treated well and that, in the end, it will 
benefit the business. Throughout its forty-four-year history, the company has 
cultivated a culture that is both inclusive and fun. Southwest’s core values 
include “Don’t take yourself too seriously” and “Don’t be a jerk.” The late 
founder and CEO, Herb Kelleher, exemplified these values. Kelleher was not 
afraid to make fun of himself and demonstrated that you should not have 
to leave your sense of humor at the office door. Leaders like Kelleher who 
have a sense of humor have been found to be 27 percent more motivating 
and admired than those without one. Kelleher himself believed that the 
intangibles were often more important than the tangibles. In his mind, a 
competitor could easily buy the tangibles, like faster airplanes, but excellent 
customer service or an organizational culture could not be purchased. The 
runway toward these intangibles is through allowing employees to express 
themselves authentically. 
 As a result of this culture, Southwest flight attendants have become 
well known for expressing their sense of humor and spreading joy among 
employees and customers alike. Although Southwest is not known for 
having the most luxurious in-flight experience, the employees still make it 
an enjoyable experience for customers. For example, employees have set up 
M04_ROBB0025_19_GE_C04.indd 139 13/12/22 2:05 AM140 PART 2 The Individual
and played “gate games” to entertain customers when there are flight delays. 
The airline also has flight attendant announcements that resemble comedy 
sketches. Southwest’s philosophy seems to be working. Glassdoor listed 
Southwest as one of the top twenty-five places to work in 2021. Research 
also supports the company’s approach, demonstrating that workplaces in 
which employees feel comfortable expressing their feelings are more likely 
to be creative, innovative, and productive. In this environment, employees 
are more likely to be friendly with one another, which significantly impacts 
employee performance.
The organization’s commitment to employee and customer well-being 
continued during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since its beginnings in 1971, the 
company has never had to institute layoffs. However, Southwest (and the rest 
of the airline industry) faced incredible financial challenges in the pandemic’s 
wake. With the threat of layoffs and pay cuts looming, employees experience 
extreme uncertainty and job insecurity. This insecurity can lead them to 
experience burdensome negative emotions resulting in emotion regulation 
difficulties. Demonstrating the company’s commitment to employees, CEO 
Gary Kelly reduced his base salary to zero and instituted a 20 percent cut in 
senior executives’ pay to reduce and hopefully avoid layoffs.1
Employee emotions cannot be separated from work. They can enhance the 
employee and customer experience just as well as they can curtail it. Given 
the obvious role emotions play in our lives, it might surprise you that the field 
of organizational behavior (OB) has not given emotions much attention until 
relatively recently. Why? Historically, researchers, theorists, and practitioners 
thought emotions would be detrimental to performance. Although managers 
knew emotions were an inseparable part of everyday life, they tried to create 
emotion-free organizations. Researchers tended to focus on strong negative 
emotions—especially anger—that interfered with an employee’s ability to work 
effectively.
Thankfully, this type of thinking has changed with the advent of the “Affective 
Revolution” in OB that is still underway.2
 Indeed, some emotions can hinder 
performance, particularly those exhibited at the wrong time. Other emotions 
are neutral, and some are constructive. Employees bring their emotions to work 
every day, so no study of OB would be comprehensive without considering the 
role of emotions in workplace behavior.
What Are Emotions and Moods?
Emotions can greatly influence our attitudes toward others, our decision mak￾ing, and our behaviors. They can even spark conflict with potentially disastrous 
consequences. For example, after being told to “stop being a crybaby,” one 
Florida Taco Bell employee threw a hot bean burrito at the supervisor, snapped 
their headset in two, and stormed out of the building.3
 In truth, we are human 
and cannot set aside our emotions, but we can acknowledge and work with 
them. And not all emotions have negative influences on us. For example, Fausto

Martinez was delighted after finding out about Amazon’s minimum wage hike. 
Martinez looked forward to a better quality of life, more time with family, and 
the lack of a need for a second full-time job.4
 By increasing the minimum wage, 
Amazon improved the quality of life of its employees and stayed competitive 
with regard to retaining them.
First, we need to discuss three closely intertwined terms: affect, emotions, and 
moods. Affect is a generic term covering a broad range of feelings, including 
emotions and moods.5 Emotions are intense, discrete, and short-lived, often 
caused by a specific event.6 Moods are longer-lived and less intense feelings 
than emotions. They often arise without a specific event acting as a stimulus.7
Exhibit 4-1 shows the relationships among affect, emotions, and moods.
As the exhibit shows, affect is a broad term that encompasses emotions 
and moods. Affect varies by its valence, or the degree to which the feelings are 
positive (e.g., excited, happy, joyous) or negative (e.g., sad, angry, frustrated). 
Second, there are differences between emotions and moods. Emotions are 
more likely to be caused by a specific event and are more fleeting than moods.
Positive and Negative Affect
As a first step toward studying moods and emotions in the workplace, we classify 
affect into two categories: positive and negative. Positive emotions—such as joy 
and gratitude—express a favorable evaluation or feeling. Negative emotions—
such as anger and guilt—express the opposite. We can think of positive affect
(PA) as a dimension consisting of positive emotions such as excitement, enthu￾siasm, and elation at the high end (high positive affect). Negative affect (NA) is 
a dimension consisting of nervousness, stress, and anxiety at the high end (high 
negative affect).8
Exhibit 4-2 illustrates the affective circumplex, which categorizes and arranges 
emotions by their degree of positivity and negativity.9
 In Exhibit 4-2, solid black 
lines directly correspond with PA and NA (e.g., emotions that directly corre￾spond with PA or NA). For example, elated is a high positive affect emotion, 
affect A term used to describe a broad 
range of feelings that people experience, 
including emotions and moods.
emotions Intense, discrete, and short￾lived feeling experiences, often caused by a 
specific event.
moods Feelings that tend to be longer-lived 
and less intense than emotions and that lack 
a contextual stimulus.
positive affect An affective dimension that 
consists of specific positive emotions such 
as excitement, enthusiasm, and elation at 
the high end.
negative affect An affective dimension that 
consists of emotions such as nervousness, 
stress, and anxiety at the high end.
Exhibit 4-1 Affect, Emotions, and Moods
Emotions
• Caused by specific event
• Very brief in duration (seconds
 or minutes)
• Specific and numerous in nature
 (many specific emotions such as
 anger, fear, sadness, happiness,
 disgust, surprise)
• Usually accompanied by distinct
 facial expressions
Moods
• Cause is often general and unclear
• Last longer than emotions (hours
 or days)
• Generally not indicated by distinct
 expressions
Affect
• Defined as a broad range of feelings that people experience.
• More general (two main dimensions–positive affect and
 negative affect–that are composed of multiple specific emotions)
• Affect can be experienced in the form of emotions or mood

while bored is a low positive affect emotion. Nervous is a high negative affect 
emotion, while relaxed is a low negative affect emotion. Finally, some emotions 
are “in between.” The dotted lines, on the other hand, demonstrate that some 
emotions can be simultaneously high or low in PA or NA. For example, upset and 
sad are simultaneously low positive affect and high negative affect, while happy 
and content are simultaneously high positive affect and low negative affect.
You will notice that this model does not include all emotions. Some, such 
as surprise, do not fit well because they are not as clearly positive or negative. 
Also, keep in mind that emotions cannot be neutral. Being neutral is being 
nonemotional.10 As described later in the chapter, people differ in how much 
they experience PA and NA. Some (we might call them affectively intense) may 
strongly experience quite a bit of high positive and high negative affect in a 
matter of days or weeks.11 Others might experience little of either. And still, 
some people may tend to experience one much more predominately than the 
other.12
The Basic Emotions
You might be wondering, how many emotions are there? There are 
dozens—including anger, contempt, enthusiasm, envy, fear, frustration, disappoint￾ment, embarrassment, disgust, happiness, hate, hope, jealousy, joy, love, pride, 
surprise, and sadness. Numerous researchers have tried to limit them to a funda￾mental set.13 Other scholars argue that by thinking in terms of “basic” emotions, 
we lose sight of the bigger picture because emotions can mean different things 
in different contexts and may vary across cultures.14 It is unlikely that psycholo￾gists or philosophers will ever completely agree on a set of basic emotions or even 
on whether there is such a thing. Still, many researchers agree on six universal 
emotions—anger, fear, sadness, happiness, disgust, and surprise.15 If you have ever 
held a job before, you can probably think of times when you have experienced these 
emotions in the workplace. For example, you might experience negative affect after 
a lousy performance review from your supervisor at the department store where 
you work. You might be angry with your boss, fearful of being terminated, or sur￾prised that the supervisor gave you such a poor evaluation.
M04_ROBB0025_19_GE_C04.indd 142 13/12/22 2:05 AMEmotions and Moods CHAPTER ­ 143
Psychologists have tried to identify basic emotions by studying how we 
express them. Facial expressions have proved difficult to interpret.16 One prob￾lem is that some emotions are too complex to be easily represented on our 
faces. Second, although people can, for the most part, recognize emotions 
across cultures at better-than-chance levels, this accuracy is worse for cultural 
groups with less exposure to one another.17 Employees can also vocally express 
their emotions, and artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing research in this 
area. For example, one machine learning (see introductory chapter) study of 
speeches from one hundred professional actors across various English-speaking 
countries found that people are better at recognizing actors’ emotions from the 
same country, suggesting that there are dialect differences in verbally expressing 
emotions.18 Differentiating emotions across cultures is quite important in this 
era of globalization; you may find yourself communicating with people from 
radically different cultures. Understanding the nuances in how they express 
emotion can be very helpful. Studying how emotions are displayed, educating 
yourself on culture-specific emotions, and paying attention to cues when inter￾acting with people from other cultures can help you become a better cross￾cultural communicator.19
Moral Emotions
Some emotions are closely tied to our interpretations of the events that evoke 
them. One area in which researchers have been furthering this idea is through 
the study of moral emotions, that is, emotions that have moral implications 
because of our instant judgment of the situation that evokes them.20
Say you watched a video of a coworker making a sexist or racist slur. You might 
feel disgusted because it offends your sense of right and wrong. You might feel 
a variety of emotions based on your moral judgment of the situation.21 Other 
examples of moral emotions include sympathy for others’ suffering, guilt about 
our immoral behavior, anger about injustice done to others, and contempt for 
those who behave unethically. Therefore, we need to be aware of the moral 
aspects of situations that trigger our emotions and make certain we understand 
the context before we act, especially in the workplace.22
Research indicates that our responses to moral emotions differ from our 
responses to other emotions.23 When we feel moral anger, we may be more 
likely to confront the situation that causes it than when we just feel angry. For 
instance, emergency room doctors and hospital specialists who deal with crises 
daily found that observing others’ suffering led them to experience sympathetic 
moral emotions and advocate for the patient.24 In contrast, other doctors’ 
unethical behaviors led fellow doctors to become angry and sanction them. 
However, we cannot assume that our emotional reactions to events will be the 
same as someone else’s. Children develop moral emotions during childhood as 
they learn moral norms and standards, so moral emotions depend on the situ￾ation and normative context more so than other emotions. Because morality 
differs from one culture to the next, so do moral emotions.
People previously believed that most ethical decision making relied on 
thinking and cognition. Research on moral emotions increasingly questions this 
perspective. Numerous studies suggest that ethical decisions are primarily based 
on feelings rather than on thoughts, even though we tend to see moral issues 
as logical and reasonable, not as emotional.25 To some degree, our beliefs are 
shaped by the groups to which we belong, which influence our perceptions of 
ethics in certain situations. Unfortunately, these shared perceptions may lead us 
to justify purely emotional reactions as rationally “ethical” just because we share 
them with others.26 We also tend to judge (and punish) outgroup members 
(anyone who is not in our group) more harshly for moral transgressions than 
moral emotions Emotions that have moral 
implications because of our instant judgment 
of the situation that evokes them.
M04_ROBB0025_19_GE_C04.indd 143 13/12/22 2:05 AM144 PART 2 The Individual
ingroup members, even when we are trying to be objective (see the chapter on 
diversity).
27 Also, we tend to glorify ingroup members (anyone who is part of 
our group), exercising more leniency when judging their misdeeds, often lead￾ing to an ethics double standard.28
You can think about this research to see how moral emotions operate in your 
own life. Consider a time when you have done something that hurt someone 
else. Did you feel angry or upset with yourself? Or think about a time when you 
have seen someone else treated unfairly. Did you feel contempt for the person 
acting unfairly, or did you engage in a cool, rational calculation of the situa￾tion’s fairness? Most people who think about these situations have some sense of 
an emotional stirring that might prompt them to engage in ethical actions like 
donating money to help others, apologizing and attempting to make amends, 
or intervening on behalf of those who have been mistreated. In sum, we can 
conclude that behaving ethically at least partially involves making decisions 
based on emotions and feelings.
Emotions can be fleeting, but moods can endure, and for quite a while. To 
understand the impact of emotions and moods in organizations, we next classify 
the many distinct emotions into broader mood categories.
Experiencing Moods and Emotions
As if it were not complex enough to consider the many distinct emotions a per￾son might experience, the reality is that we all experience moods differently as 
well. For most people, positive moods are somewhat more common than nega￾tive moods. Indeed, research finds nearly universal evidence for a positivity 
offset, meaning that at zero input (when nothing in particular is going on), 
most individuals experience a mildly positive mood.29 The positivity offset 
appears for employees in a wide range of job settings. For example, one study 
of customer service representatives in a British call center revealed that people 
reported experiencing positive moods 58 percent of the time despite the stress￾ful environment.30 Furthermore, negative emotions tend to lead to negative 
moods. Perhaps this happens because people think about events that created 
strong negative emotions five times as long as events that created strong posi￾tive ones.31
Does the degree to which people experience positive and negative emo￾tions vary across cultures? Yes (see the OB Poll). The reason is not that people 
of various cultures are inherently different. People in most cultures appear to 
experience many positive and negative emotions similarly, and people interpret 
them in much the same way worldwide.32 We all view negative emotions such as 
hate, terror, and rage as dangerous and destructive. We desire positive emotions 
such as joy, love, and happiness. However, an individual’s experience of emo￾tions appears to be culturally shaped.33
Some cultures value certain emotions more than others, which leads indi￾viduals to change their perspective on experiencing these emotions.34 For 
instance, many cultures, such as Mexico and Brazil, emphasize positive emotions 
and expressions.35 However, some cultures, such as Japan and Russia, embrace 
negative emotions as useful and constructive. Interestingly, negative emotions 
are less detrimental to the health of those of Eastern (negative emotion valu￾ing) as opposed to Western cultures.36 In support, research suggests valuing 
negative affect often allows people to accept present circumstances and cope, 
reducing the adverse effects on physical and psychological health and decision 
making.37 Negative affect may also allow managers to think more critically and 
fairly.38 However, differences in what is considered ideal affect across cultures 
can have significant implications for workplace diversity. For instance, a series 
of studies comparing European Americans and Hong Kong Chinese found that 
European Americans conveyed more PA emotions in their job applications 
positivity offset The tendency of most 
individuals to experience a mildly positive 
mood at zero input (when nothing in 
particular is going on).

and remote interviews than Hong Kong Chinese. 39 Furthermore, European 
American hiring managers rated their ideal applicant as displaying more PA 
emotions and were more likely to hire applicants who displayed these emotions 
for internships. 40
 Now that we have identified the basic emotions, the basic moods, and our 
experience of them, let’s explore the function of emotions and moods, particu￾larly in the workplace. 
 The Function of Emotions 
 In some ways, emotions are a mystery. What function do they serve? As we will 
discuss, a large number of reviews suggest that positive employee emotions tend 
to enhance job attitudes, job engagement, job performance, and organizational 
citizenship behavior (OCB); decrease withdrawal and counterproductive work 
behaviors (CWBs); and lead employees to experience more success than their 
unhappy counterparts. 41 Better yet, individuals who tend to experience positive 
affect consistently as part of their personalities (see the chapter on personality 
and individual differences) tend to enjoy these positive outcomes long-term. 42
Do Emotions Make Us Irrational? How often have you heard someone say, “Oh, 
you’re just being emotional”? You might have been offended. Observations like 
this suggest that rationality and emotion are in conflict and that by exhibiting 
emotion, you are acting irrationally. The perceived association between the two 
is so strong that some researchers argue that displaying emotions such as sad￾ness to the point of crying is so toxic to a career that we should leave the room 
rather than allow others to witness it. 43 This perspective suggests that the dem￾onstration or even experience of emotions can make us seem weak, brittle, or 
irrational. However, our emotions can make our thinking more rational. Why? 
Because our emotions provide essential information about how we understand

the world around us and help guide our behaviors. For instance, individuals in 
a negative mood may be better able to discern truthful from inaccurate infor￾mation than are people in a happy mood.44 Furthermore, cold rationality does 
not acknowledge that in the world around us people are, by nature, emotional. 
We would do best to recognize and understand our own emotions (and others’) 
and use this information in our interactions with others.
When we can identify the sources of emotions and moods, we can better pre￾dict behavior and manage our interactions with people more effectively. Let’s 
explore that topic next.
Sources of Emotions and Moods
4-2 Identify the sources of 
emotions and moods.
It’s 8:15 a.m. on Monday, and you are so incredibly excited to tell your coworker, 
Jordan, the good news about the shiny Pokémon you caught in Pokémon Go. 
You rush over, but Jordan immediately stops you and says, “Don’t even talk to 
me until I’ve had my coffee.” Defeated, you walk back to your station and con￾tinue your opening activities. You wonder where this bad mood originated and 
begin to feel angry toward your coworker. You mutter under your breath, “I 
won’t trade the extra shiny Pokémon I caught with Jordan. We will see who’s 
upset then!” We have all, no doubt, been in a similar situation before. Negative 
emotions and moods are often unavoidable and can certainly impact our work. 
Jordan hurt your feelings, harming the floor team’s functioning that day; now 
you may be preoccupied with what Jordan said and miss one of your opening 
tasks. We are often left wondering where these emotions and moods originated. 
Was it really the lack of coffee? Maybe something else was going on. Here we 
discuss some of the primary influences on emotions and moods.
Personality
Affect has a personality trait component, meaning that some people have 
built-in tendencies to experience certain moods and emotions more frequently 
than others. Is Jordan frequently prone to experiencing negative emotions? 
It could be that Jordan’s reaction is a reflection of personality. People also 
experience the same emotions with different intensities; the degree to which 
they experience them is called their affect intensity.
45 Affectively intense 
people experience both positive and negative emotions more deeply: When 
they are sad, they are really sad, and when they are happy, they are really 
happy. Both the tendency to experience positive and negative emotions and 
the intensity at which we feel them affect several factors at work, such as our 
typical moods, job satisfaction, and engagement at work (see the chapter on 
attitudes and job satisfaction).
46 For example, one review of more than one 
hundred studies suggests that the tendency to experience positive emotions 
and moods is the strongest predictor of whether an employee is engaged.47
Time of Day
Maybe it was just too early for Jordan to interact with coworkers. Indeed, research 
does show that moods vary by the time of day. Furthermore, most of us follow 
the same pattern. On a typical weekday, levels of positive affect tend to rise in 
the morning after sunrise, peaking in the late morning (ten o’clock to noon) 
and then slowly decline until early evening (around six o’clock). Then positive 
affect switches direction and increases until midnight. Afterward, the trajectory 
switches direction again and declines until sunrise.48 As for negative affect, most 
research suggests it fluctuates less than positive affect.49 However, the general 
trend is for it to increase over the day, so it is lowest early in the morning and 
highest late in the evening.50 A fascinating study assessed the effect of time 
affect intensity Individual differences 
in the strength with which individuals 
experience their emotions.

of day on affect by analyzing millions of tweets (i.e., Twitter messages) world￾wide.51 The researchers captured words connoting positive affect (e.g., happy, 
enthused, excited) and negative (e.g., sad, angry, anxious) affect. You can see 
the trends they observed in the positive affect part of Exhibit 4-3.

You may wonder what happens for people who work the third shift at night. 
When our internal circadian process is out of line with our waking hours, our 
moods and well-being are likely to be negatively affected. However, researchers 
studying how the body’s inner clock can be adjusted have found that governing 
our exposure to light may allow us to shift our circadian rhythms.52 Thus, by 
manipulating light and darkness, someone who is awake at night might have a 
similar mood cycle to someone who sleeps at night.
Day of the Week
Was this just a case of the “Mondays” for Jordan? In most cultures, Mondays can 
be ...“problematic” for employees—for example, as shown in Exhibit 4-4, U.S. 
adults tend to experience their highest positive affect on Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday and their lowest on Monday.53 This tends to be true in several other 
cultures. This is not the case in all cultures, however. In Japan, positive affect is 
higher on Monday than on either Friday or Saturday.54
As for negative affect, Monday is the highest negative-affect day across most 
cultures.55 However, in some countries, negative affect is lower on Friday and 
Saturday than on Sunday. It may be that while Sunday is enjoyable as a day off 
(and thus we have higher positive affect), people also get a bit stressed about 
the week ahead (which is why negative affect is higher).
Weather
Maybe Jordan was feeling a little ...“under the weather.” Many people believe that 
their mood is tied to the weather, and indeed, there are many self-proclaimed 
“rain haters” and “summer lovers.”56 However, an extensive body of evidence 
suggests weather has little effect on mood, at least for most people.57 Illusory 
correlation, which occurs when we associate two events that, in reality, have no 
connection, explains why people tend to think weather influences them. For 
example, employees may be more productive on bad weather days, a study in 
Japan and the United States demonstrated, but not because of mood. Instead, 
the worse weather removed some work distractions.58
Stress
Maybe Jordan was anxious about a worrisome meeting with the manager later 
that afternoon. As you might imagine, stressful events at work (a nasty e-mail, 
impending deadline, loss of a big sale, reprimand from the boss, etc.) negatively 
affect our emotions and moods (which we discuss in more detail in the chap￾ter on organizational health and stress). As the authors of one study note, “A 
constant diet of even low-level stressful events has the potential to cause work￾ers to experience gradually increasing levels of strain over time.”59 Mounting 
levels of stress can worsen our moods as we experience more negative emotions. 
Although sometimes we thrive on it,60 most of us find stress usually takes a toll 
on our mood. In fact, when situations are overly emotionally charged and stress￾ful, we have a natural response to disengage, to literally look away.61
Social Interactions
Just as Jordan may have had a negative interaction with the supervisor early in 
the day, so too were you affected by your interaction with Jordan. Indeed the 
interactions we have with other people can affect our emotions and moods. 
These negative experiences can also, by consequence, affect our relationships 
with others, leading to strengthened or dissolving bonds between people.62 As 
an example, negative interactions at work not only can affect your emotions at 
work, they are so powerful that these emotions can “spill over” and affect your 
relationships with family members.63 Social interactions also do not solely result 
illusory correlation The tendency of people 
to associate two events when in reality there 
is no connection.

roller coaster” (e.g., experience both positive and negative social interactions 
frequently) can lead us to feel bittersweet or conflicted about that person.64

Sleep
Maybe Jordan was extremely tired that morning due to a lack of sleep (and, 
hence, the need for coffee). Apparently, the world could use more sleep, with 
roughly 62 percent of adults from twelve countries reporting in 2019 that they do 
not sleep well or long enough.65 Adults report sleeping less than adults did a gen￾eration ago.66 Data mined from millions of users of the “Sleep Cycle” app suggest 
that on average, sleep length and quality have diminished over the years.67
Sleep quality affects moods and decision making, and increased fatigue puts 
workers at risk of disease, injury, and depression.68 Poor or reduced sleep also 
leads to emotional changes, makes it difficult to control emotions, and can impair 
job satisfaction.69 On the positive side, increased regular sleep can reduce the 
negative effects of fatigue and stress on employees’ emotions.70 Furthermore, 
University of California–San Diego researchers calculated that, for employees who 
do not sleep enough, “a one-hour increase in long-run average sleep increases 
wages by 16 percent, equivalent to more than a year of schooling.”71
Exercise
To deal with the negative emotions surrounding your interaction with Jordan, 
have you considered exercising after work (maybe play some more Pokémon 
Go)? Perhaps you have heard that people should exercise to improve their 
mood. Does “sweat therapy” really work? It appears so. Research consistently 
shows that exercise enhances people’s positive moods and reduces perceptions 
of fatigue.72 Exercise can also help protect against persistent negative moods 
and improve the ability to recover from negative experiences.73
Gender Identity
You may think that Jordan’s behavior may be attributable to gender differences 
in emotions. Indeed, many people may stereotypically believe women are more 
emotional than men (see the chapter on diversity). Although several reviews have 
found differences in emotion display across genders that tend to increase with 
age,74 these tend to be trivial or small and likely reflect differences in upbring￾ing and stereotypes or even the way emotions are measured rather than actual 
differences.75
Unfortunately, these stereotypical perceptions of women as “emotional” and 
men as “angry” persist in the workplace despite little evidence that they are 
true. For example, a Denver police commander filed a civil rights complaint 
Staples believes that exercise in￾creases positive moods and results 
in happier, healthier, and more 
productive employees. At company 
headquarters, the office supply 
retailer offers employees onsite 
strength training and cardiovascular 
conditioning classes during their 
lunch hour, including a truck push 
(shown here), military crawls, and 
other boot-camp-type activities.

against the city for gender discrimination, noting that the chief told her she 
was “emotional” and “immature,” denying her a promotion to deputy chief.76
People also tend to make attributions about women’s personalities in ways that 
might be based on stereotypes of typical emotional reactions. One study showed 
that when viewing pictures of faces, participants interpreted the women’s emo￾tional expressions as being dispositional (related to personality), whereas the 
men’s expressions were interpreted as situational.77 For example, a picture of a 
sad woman led observers to believe she had an emotional personality, whereas a 
picture of sadness in a man was more likely to be attributed to having a bad day.
Let us put together what we have learned about emotions and moods with 
workplace coping strategies, beginning with emotional labor.
Emotional Labor
If you have ever had a job in retail or in sales or waited on tables in a restaurant, 
you know the importance of projecting a friendly demeanor and smiling. Even 
though there were days when you did not feel cheerful, you knew management 
expected you to be upbeat when dealing with customers, so you either tried to 
become upbeat and cheerful or otherwise faked it.
When you work, you expend physical and mental labor (or energy) by 
putting your body and mind, respectively, into your job. But jobs also require 
emotional labor, an employee’s expression of organizationally desired emotions 
during interpersonal transactions at work.78 Emotional labor is a key compo￾nent of effective job performance.79 We expect flight attendants to be cheerful, 
funeral directors to be sad, and doctors to be emotionally neutral.
Controlling Emotional Displays
The way we experience an emotion is obviously not always the same as the way we 
show it. To analyze emotional labor, we divide emotions into felt or displayed emo￾tions.
80 Felt emotions are our actual emotions.81 In contrast, displayed emotions
are those the organization requires workers to show and considers appropriate in 
each job. For instance, research suggests that in U.S. workplaces, it is expected that 
employees should typically display positive emotions like happiness and excite￾ment and suppress negative emotions like fear, anger, disgust, and contempt.82
Effective managers have learned to look serious when they give an 
employee a negative performance evaluation and to look calm when they 
are berated by their bosses because the organization expects these displays. 
Conversely, effective employees have learned to earn their managers’ favor 
(and perhaps pay raises and promotions) by enthusiastically agreeing with 
their supervisors.83 Of course, there are no display rules for many workplace 
situations. Does your employer dictate what emotions you display when 
you are, say, heading out for lunch? Probably not. Many workplaces have 
explicit display rules, but usually only for interactions that matter, particu￾larly between employees and customers. Regarding employee and customer 
interactions, you might expect that the more an employer dictates salespeo￾ple’s emotional displays, the higher the sales. Employees under very high or 
very low display rules do not perform as well in sales situations as employees 
who have moderate display rules and a high degree of discretion in their 
roles.84 Furthermore, informal display rules can also be biased. For instance, 
research uncovered a stereotype that Black grocery store workers were per￾ceived as less warm than White workers, leading Black grocery store workers 
to engage in more emotional labor (by displaying more positive emotions) 
than White workers.85 In other words, Black workers were held to a higher 
customer service standard because of the stereotype.

 Displaying fake emotions requires us to suppress real ones. Surface acting
is hiding feelings and emotional expressions in response to display rules. A worker 
who smiles at a customer even when they do not feel like it is surface acting. Deep 
acting is trying to modify our true feelings based on display rules. Surface acting 
deals with displayed emotions, and deep acting deals with felt emotions. The COVID￾19 context and proliferation of virtual/remote work have made the nature of sur￾face and deep acting even more complex. In other words, with fewer face-to-face 
interactions, can people even tell whether emotions are authentic? One study in 
the COVID-19 era found that e-mail can be better for “masking” emotional leakage, 
although it is a double-edged sword because recipients view “richer” forms of com￾munication like Zoom as conveying the “authenticity’ of emotions better. On the 
other hand, for surface actors, a middle ground is better (e.g., telephone). 86 
 Displaying emotions we do not really feel can be exhausting because they 
take effort to display and can make us feel inauthentic. 87 Surface acting is asso￾ciated with increased stress and decreased job satisfaction. 88 Daily surface acting 
can also lead to emotional exhaustion at home, work–family conflict, absentee￾ism, and insomnia. 89 On the other hand, deep acting has a positive relationship 
with job satisfaction (especially when the work is challenging), job performance, 
and even better customer treatment and tips. 90
 The disparity between employees having to project one emotion while feeling 
another is called emotional dissonance . Bottled-up feelings of frustration, anger, 
and resentment can lead to emotional exhaustion. Long-term emotional dis￾sonance is a predictor for job burnout, declines in job performance, lower job 
satisfaction, and even more nefarious effects like alcohol abuse and lashing out 
at coworkers. 91

between the emotions people feel and the 
emotions they project. 
 All Employees Experience Emotional Labor in 
the Same Way 
 All employees experience emo￾tional labor in some way. However, 
there is substantial variation in 
the degree to which employees experi￾ence it and its consequences. Research 
reveals that, in general, the experience 
of emotional labor is more taxing for 
introverts compared with extroverts. 
Surface acting (hiding feelings and emo￾tional expressions) is also more strongly 
related to emotional exhaustion and 
negative affect for introverts than extro￾verts. On the other hand, deep acting 
(trying to modify true feelings) was more 
strongly related to extroverts’ negative 
affect. These findings demonstrate that 
deep acting’s negative and positive emo￾tional effects both impact extroverts. 
 There are also important implica￾tions for individuals and organizations. 
Extroverts likely perform well in sales 
positions not only because they are 
more sociable but also because of 
their capacity to cope with the emo￾tional demands typical in service jobs. 
Even though some employees may 
be well equipped to handle emotional 
labor’s demands, surface acting still 
tends to result in greater emotional 
exhaustion and reduced job satis￾faction. Organizations cannot regu￾late their employees’ emotions, but 
they can minimize the disconnection 
between expected and felt emotions. 
One strategy could be teaching employ￾ees to frame customer demands as 
challenges rather than threats. 
 Personality is not the only factor 
that influences how employees experi￾ence emotional labor. For instance, one 
study found that Black service provid￾ers who did not engage in emotional 
labor (e.g., deep acting) were perceived 
as less warm than White service pro￾viders. In this study, Black service 
providers had to exert more emo￾tional effort to be viewed favorably by 
customers, which researchers attri￾bute to racial stereotypes. Also, prior 
research has shown that supervisors 
rated Black employees lower on inter￾personal warmth and job performance 
than White employees. Although Black 
employees might engage in additional 
emotional labor practices to match oth￾ers’ service performance, the inequity 
and additional effort are demanding 
and harmful to one’s sense of self and 
well-being. More attention needs to 
be directed toward developing strate￾gies that can reduce the barriers Black 
employees may face, particularly in the 
service industry. 92
 Myth or Science?

Affective events theory, discussed in the next section, fits a job’s emotional 
labor requirements into a construct with implications for work events, emotional 
reactions, job satisfaction, and job performance.
Affective Events Theory
We have seen that emotions and moods are an important part of our personal 
and work lives. But how do they influence our job performance and satisfac￾tion? Affective events theory (AET) proposes that employees react emotionally 
to things that happen to them at work, and these reactions influence their job 
performance and satisfaction.97 For example, Lisamarie, a benefits administra￾tor in North Carolina, began the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process after she 
was unable to conceive a child for six years and halfway through found out her 
employer was dropping the benefit—she was “gutted” and “lost,” “cried for 
a week,” and undoubtedly did not feel satisfied with her job following such a 
blow.98
Work events trigger positive or negative emotional reactions, to which 
employees’ personalities and moods predispose them to respond with greater 
or lesser intensity.99 However, we experience some events more often than oth￾ers, so does this have an effect on the types of affective reactions we experience 
at work? Some research supports the idea that it does, given that interpersonal 
mistreatment by customers of part-time workers accounted for nearly 50 per￾cent of negative affective work events.100
Further, given the shift toward remote work in the modern era, researchers 
have turned their sights toward what affective events look like for remote work￾ers. For remote workers, a positive affective event might be a quick and produc￾tive Zoom meeting with colleagues, whereas a negative affective event might be 
a terrible connection (and a conspicuous high-pitched screech that no one can 
diagnose) making it difficult to get anything done.101
In sum, AET offers two important messages.102 First, emotions provide valu￾able insights into how workplace events influence employee performance and 
satisfaction. Second, employees and managers should not ignore emotions 
or the events that cause them, even when they appear minor, because they 
accumulate. EI is another framework that helps us understand the impact of 
emotions on job performance, so we will look at that topic next.
Emotional Intelligence
As the CEO of an international talent company, Terrie Upshur-Lupberger was 
at a career pinnacle. So why was she resentful and unhappy? A close friend 
observed, “Terrie, you were out on the skinny branch—you know, the one that 
breaks easily in a strong wind. You were so busy and overwhelmed and out of

attitudes and behaviors.
4-5 Describe emotional 
intelligence.
Emotionally intelligent employees (as discussed in a later section)93 as well 
as those who have a high capacity for self-control, who sleep well every night, 
who have strong relationships with their customers or clients, and who are 
empowered to give help to others at work tend to be buffered to some degree 
from the negative side effects of emotional dissonance.94 However, employees 
who fear isolation and strongly desire to please others (and belong to the 
group) are more likely to experience the negative effects of emotional disso￾nance.95 In general, although there are individual differences that affect how 
employees manage emotional labor, research suggests that employees, lead￾ers, and managers can be trained to regulate their emotional displays when 
appropriate.96

touch with your own values, cares, and guiding beliefs that you failed to pay atten￾tion to the branch that was about to break.”103 According to Upshur-Lupberger, 
she had failed to notice that her moods constantly swung toward frustration and 
exhaustion. Her job satisfaction, productivity, and relationships suffered. Worse, 
she was too busy to realize the deficiencies until she was completely depleted. 
She said, “I learned that, as a leader, you either pay attention to and manage 
the moods (including your own) in the organization, or ... you ignore them 
and pay the price.”104 Upshur-Lupberger learned the value of emotional intel￾ligence (EI).
Employers value EI. In one CareerBuilder survey of more than 2,500 hiring 
managers and HR professionals, 59 percent said they would not hire someone 
with high cognitive ability (e.g., IQ; see the chapter on personality and indi￾vidual differences) but low EI, and 75 percent said they would be more likely 
to promote a high EI candidate over one with high IQ.105 In another study that 
tracked college students from graduation to more than ten years after entering 
the workforce, EI predicted how high their salary was ten years later as well as 
whether the alumni had a mentor.106
Emotional intelligence (EI) is a person’s ability to (1) perceive emotions in 
oneself and others, (2) understand the meaning of these emotions, and (3) reg￾ulate one’s own emotions accordingly, as shown in Exhibit 4-5.107 When asked 
why they value EI over cognitive ability, the managers in the Career Builder 
study noted that they are more in tune with their emotions, so they can stay calm 
under pressure, resolve conflict more effectively, be empathetic with coworkers 
and team members, and effectively regulate their emotions.108
Several studies suggest that EI plays an important role in predicting job atti￾tudes and facilitating academic and job performance, although the survey items 
are often strikingly similar to other items from personality, intelligence, and 
self-perception tests.109 Other reviews suggest that EI is related to improving 
teamwork effectiveness, organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) (see intro￾ductory chapter), and career decision making (e.g., managing employment 
gaps) as well as reducing CWBs (see the chapter on job attitudes).
110 South 
Korean managers with high EI tend to have better sales figures than those with 
low EI because they were able to create more cohesive stores and improved 
sales-directed behavior.111
For a leadership perspective, one research study examined eleven U.S. 
presidents—from Franklin Roosevelt to Bill Clinton—and evaluated them on 
emotional intelligence (EI) The ability to 
detect and to manage emotional cues and 
information.

six qualities: communication, organization, political skill, vision, cognitive style, 
and EI. The key quality that differentiated the successful (such as Roosevelt, 
Kennedy, and Reagan) from the unsuccessful (such as Johnson, Carter, and 
Nixon) was EI. 112 Furthermore, studies of popularity suggest that it is EI, not 
narcissism, that predicts long-term popularity. 113 As such, leaders and employ￾ees alike who are high on EI tend to be more popular and successful because 
they are able to understand and manage their own and others’ emotions. 114
 However, it appears as if there are limits to the degree to which EI can be help￾ful in the workplace. For example, one study of Dutch administrative assistants 
suggests that EI that is focused on the self (e.g., self-understanding) decreases 
the experience of stress, but with physiological costs, while other-focused EI 
(e.g., accurately perceiving emotions in others) only weakly explained task per￾formance. 115 This suggests that EI may be costly and not as effective as we think, 
especially in emotionally demanding contexts. Furthermore, some research sug￾gests that EI might even be related to how well people can fake tests (because 
they understand what desirable answers are on tests). 116 According to this 
research, if you use a personality test to screen candidates for a job, those with 
high EI may be better at faking it. 
 An Ethical Choice 
 Should Managers Use Emotional 
Intelligence (EI) Tests? 
 As we discussed in this chapter, 
the concept of EI has raised 
some debate. One of the deci￾sions for managers is whether to use 
EI tests in the selection process. Here 
are some ethical considerations: 
• There is no commonly accepted 
test. For instance, researchers have 
recently used the Mayer–Salovey–
Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test 
(MSCEIT), the Trait Emotional Intel￾ligence Questionnaire, and the Situ￾ational Judgment Test of Emotional 
Intelligence (SJT of EI) in studies. 
Researchers feel EI tests may need 
to be culturally specific because 
emotional displays vary by culture; 
thus, the interpretation of emotional 
cues differs. For example, a recent 
study comparing the EI scores for In￾dian and North American executives 
using the Emotional Competence 
Inventory (ECI-2) test found the re￾sults similar but not the same, sug￾gesting the need for modification. 
• Applicants may react negatively to 
taking an EI test in general or to 
parts of it. The face recognition test, 
for example, may seem culturally 
biased to some if the subject photos 
are not diverse. Also, participants 
who score high on EI tests tend to 
consider them fair; applicants who 
score lower may not perceive the 
tests to be fair and can thus view the 
hiring organizations unfavorably—
even if they score well on other 
assessments. 
• EI tests may not be predictive of 
performance for all types of jobs. In 
a study of six hundred Romanian 
participants, results indicated that 
EI was valid for salespeople, pub￾lic servants, and CEOs of public 
hospitals, but these were all roles 
requiring significant social inter￾action. EI tests may need to be 
tailored for each position catego￾ry or not be used when the posi￾tion description does not warrant 
such tests. 
• It remains somewhat unclear what EI 
tests are actually measuring. They may 
reflect personality or intelligence, in 
which case other measures might be 
better. Also, some EI tests may predict 
job performance, but many of these 
tests include personality constructs 
and measures of general mental ability. 
• There is not enough research on 
how EI affects, for instance, CWB. It 
may not be prudent to test and se￾lect applicants who are rated high 
on EI when we are not yet certain 
that everything about EI leads to 
desired workplace outcomes. 
 These concerns suggest that EI tests 
should be avoided in hiring decisions. 
However, because research has indicated 
that EI does predict job performance to 
some degree, managers should not be too 
hasty to dismiss them altogether. Rather, 
those wishing to use EI in hiring decisions 
should be aware of these issues to make 
informed and ethical decisions about not 
only whom to hire but how. 117 
M04_ROBB0025_19_GE_C04.indd 155 13/12/22 2:05 AM156 PART 2 The Individual
Although the field is progressing in its understanding of EI, many questions 
have not been answered.118 One relates to a better understanding of EI. For 
example, we need to be precise when we talk about EI—are we referring to EI 
in general? Or to regulating emotions, understanding emotions, or perceiving 
emotions specifically? A second question is about the reliability of EI testing and 
how best to measure EI. Several advancements have been made in this area, for 
example, by having test-takers recognize emotions from video clips and by hav￾ing them respond with what they would do in emotionally charged situations.119
A third question is one of the most important for managers in organizations: 
Can EI be learned? Several reviews of dozens of studies suggest that EI can be 
trained and developed as a skill—although, paradoxically, the people who need 
it the most are the ones least likely to actually seek it out!120
All questions aside, EI is wildly popular among consulting firms and in the pop￾ular press, and it has accumulated some support in the research literature. Love 
it or hate it, one thing is for sure—EI is here to stay. So might be our next topic, 
emotion regulation, which is increasingly studied as an independent concept.121
Emotion Regulation
Have you ever tried to cheer yourself up when you were feeling down or calm 
yourself when you were feeling angry? If so, you have engaged in emotion 
regulation.
122 The central idea behind emotion regulation is to identify and 
modify the emotions you feel. For instance, workers worldwide have had to reg￾ulate emotions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many facing an 
uncertain labor market as well as changing family responsibilities and work–
family conflict.123 Emotion regulation is a strong predictor of task performance 
for some jobs and for OCB.124 Therefore, in our study of OB, we are interested 
in when and how emotion regulation is used in the workplace. We begin by iden￾tifying which individuals might naturally employ it.
Emotion Regulation Influences and Outcomes
As you might suspect, not everyone is equally good at regulating emotions.125
Individuals who are higher in the personality trait of neuroticism (see the chap￾ter on personality and individual differences) have more trouble doing so and 
often find that their moods are beyond their ability to control. Individuals who 
have lower levels of self-esteem are also less likely to try to improve their sad 
moods, perhaps because they are less likely than others to feel they deserve to 
be in a good mood.126 Finally, university seniors who are more focused on mas￾tering the job search process were better able to regulate their emotions and 
engaged in more job search behaviors as a result.127
The workplace environment influences an individual’s tendency to employ 
emotion regulation. In general, diversity in work groups increases the likelihood 
that you will regulate your emotions. For example, younger employees are likely to 
regulate their emotions when their work groups include older members.128 Racial 
diversity also has an effect: If diversity is low, the underrepresented employee will 
engage in emotion regulation, perhaps to “fit in” with the other employees as 
much as possible.129 These findings suggest a beneficial outcome of diversity—it 
may cause us to regulate our emotions more consciously and effectively.
While regulating your emotions might seem beneficial, research suggests 
there may be a downside to trying to change the way you feel. Changing your 
emotions takes effort and, as we noted when discussing emotional labor, this 
effort can be exhausting. Sometimes attempts to change an emotion actually 
make the emotion stronger; for example, trying to talk yourself out of being 
afraid can make you focus more on what scares you, which makes you more

afraid.130 From another perspective, research suggests that avoiding negative 
emotional experiences is less likely to lead to positive moods than does seek￾ing out positive emotional experiences.131 For example, you are more likely to 
experience a positive mood if you have a pleasant conversation with a friend 
than if you avoid an unpleasant conversation with a hostile coworker.
Interestingly, some positions involve more customer incivility and mistreatment 
directed toward employees than others—positions with higher levels of customer 
mistreatment (e.g., call center employees) necessitate more employee emotion reg￾ulation and, as a result, can lead to higher levels of employee exhaustion.132 Do you 
want to make a customer service employee’s life easier? Be nice to them! One study 
of supermarket checkout operators found that smiling at checkout staff and engag￾ing in short conversations reduces the staff members’ emotion regulation needs and 
as such reduces their emotional exhaustion and improves their performance.133
Emotion Regulation Techniques
Researchers of emotion regulation often study the strategies people employ to 
change their emotions (for example, as we discussed earlier in the chapter, deep 
acting and surface acting are emotion regulation techniques).
One technique of emotion regulation is emotional suppression, or suppress￾ing initial emotional responses to situations. This response seems to facilitate 
practical thinking in the short term but is generally ineffective when compared 
with expressing ones’ emotions.134 However, it appears to be helpful only when 
a strongly negative event would illicit a distressed emotional reaction during a 
crisis.135 For example, a portfolio manager might suppress an emotional reac￾tion to a sudden drop in the value of a stock and can therefore clearly decide 
how to plan. Suppression used in crisis situations appears to help an individual 
recover from the event emotionally, while suppression used as an everyday emo￾tion regulation technique can take a toll on mental ability, emotional ability, 
health, and relationships.136 Thus, unless we are truly in a crisis, acknowledging 
rather than suppressing our emotional responses to situations and reevaluating 
events after they occur yield the best outcomes.137
Cognitive reappraisal, or reframing our outlook on an emotional situation, is 
one way to regulate emotions effectively.138 Cognitive reappraisal ability seems 
to be the most helpful to individuals in situations where they cannot control the 
sources of stress.139 For example, if you lost your job, reframing it as an opportu￾nity to try the new career you always dreamed about may help you regulate your 
emotions. One study illustrates the potentially powerful effect of this technique. 
Israeli participants who were shown anger-inducing information about the Israeli–
Palestinian conflict after they were primed to reappraise the situation showed 
more inclination toward conciliation and less inclination toward aggressive tactics 
against Palestinians than the control group, not only immediately after the study 
but up to five months later. This result suggests that cognitive reappraisal may 
allow people to change their emotional responses, even when the subject matter 
is as highly emotionally charged as the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.140 However, 
cognitive reappraisal can be used for unethical aims—for instance, reappraising 
the shame and guilt one would anticipate for performing CWBs may lead people 
to reconsider and actually commit to engaging in unethical CWBs.141 Yet another 
study found that cognitive reappraisal can actually lead to mental fatigue, suggest￾ing that not all of the outcomes of cognitive reappraisal are positive.142
Another technique with potential for emotion regulation is social sharing, or 
venting. Research shows that the open expression of emotions can help indi￾viduals to regulate their emotions as opposed to keeping emotions “bottled up.” 
Social sharing can reduce anger reactions when people can talk about the facts 
of a bad situation, their feelings about the situation, or any positive aspects of 
the situation.143 For example, venting to your coworker after work about the 
M04_ROBB0025_19_GE_C04.indd 157 13/12/22 2:05 AM158 PART 2 The Individual
heated interchange with your manager in the kitchen may help you express 
your feelings and understand the situation a little better. Caution must be exer￾cised, though, because expressing your frustration affects other people. In fact, 
whether venting emotions helps the “venter” feel better depends very much 
upon the listener’s response. If the listener does not respond (many refuse to 
respond to venting), the venter feels worse. If the listener responds with expres￾sions of support or validation, the venter feels better. Therefore, if we are going 
to vent to a coworker, we need to choose someone who will respond sympatheti￾cally. Venting to the perceived offender rarely improves things and can result in 
heightening the negative emotions.144
While emotion regulation techniques can help us cope with difficult work￾place situations, research indicates that the effect varies. For example, one study 
of employees working for abusive supervisors reported emotional exhaustion and 
work-withdrawal tendencies but to different degrees based on the emotion reg￾ulation strategies they employed. Employees who used suppression techniques 
suffered greater emotional exhaustion and work withdrawal than employees who 
used cognitive reappraisal. This suggests that more research on the application 
of techniques needs to be done to help employees increase their coping skills.145
Ethics of Emotion Regulation
Emotion regulation has important ethical implications. On one end of the con￾tinuum, some people might argue or perceive that controlling your emotions 
is unethical because it requires a degree of acting.146 On the other end, people 
might argue that all emotions should be controlled so you can take a dispassion￾ate perspective. Both arguments—and all arguments in between—have ethical 
pros and cons that you will have to decide for yourself. Consider the reasons 
for emotion regulation and the outcomes. Are you regulating your emotions 
so you do not react inappropriately, or are you regulating your emotions so no 
one knows what you are thinking? Consider this: You may be able to “fake it’til 
you make it.” Recent research has found that acting like you are in a good mood 
might put you in a good mood. In one study, a group of participants was asked 
to hold only an efficient conversation with a barista serving them at Starbucks, 
while another group was asked to act happy. The happy actors reported later 
that they were in much better moods.147
The key is to be adaptive: Try to be aware of your emotions and use the regu￾lation techniques best suited for the situation.148 Now that we have studied the 
role of emotions and moods in OB, let’s consider the opportunities for more 
specific applications that our understanding provides.
OB Applications of Emotions and Moods
Our understanding of emotions and moods can affect many aspects of OB, 
including the selection process, decision making, creativity, motivation, leader￾ship, negotiation, customer service, job attitudes, deviant workplace behavior, 
and safety. Let’s think through each of these.
The Selection Process
One implication from the evidence on EI is that employers should consider it a factor in 
hiring employees, especially for jobs that demand a high degree of social interaction. 
In fact, more employers are starting to use EI measures to hire people. For example, 
a study of U.S. Air Force recruiters showed that top-performing recruiters exhibited 
high levels of EI. Using these findings, the Air Force revamped its selection criteria. 
A follow-up investigation found hires who had high EI scores were 2.6 times more

successful than those who did not.149 A second implication is that applicant emotions 
are sometimes, knowingly or not, used in selection decisions. As we mentioned earlier, 
research demonstrates that the emotional displays of applicants are often used in 
hiring decisions.150 Selecting positive team members can contribute toward a posi￾tive work environment because positive moods from these leaders can transmit from 
team member to team member. One study of 130 leaders and their followers found 
that leaders who are charismatic transfer their positive emotions to their followers 
through a contagion effect.151 It makes sense, then, to choose team members predis￾posed to positive moods. Finally, the affect of job seekers matters as well—when on 
the hunt for a new job, one is often assailed with setbacks, distressing affective events, 
and threats to one’s competence. In these cases, it is best to have compassion toward 
yourself, as research shows that this can buffer the negative emotions experienced 
during job search.152
Decision Making
Moods and emotions have effects on decision making that employees and man￾agers should understand. Positive emotions and moods seem to help people 
make sound decisions. Positive emotions also enhance problem-solving skills, so 
positive people find better solutions.153
OB researchers continue to debate the role of negative emotions and moods 
in decision making. One study suggested that people who are saddened by events 
may make the same decisions as before, while people who are angered by events 
might make stronger (though not necessarily better) choices than before.154
Another study found that participants made choices reflecting more originality 
in a negative mood.155 Still other research indicated that individuals in a nega￾tive mood may take higher risks than they do when in a positive mood.156 Taken 
together, these and other studies suggest negative (and positive) emotions affect 
decision making but that there are other variables that require further research.157
Creativity
As we see throughout this text, one strategic goal is to maximize employee pro￾ductivity through creativity. Creativity is influenced by emotions and moods, 
but there are two schools of thought on the relationship. Much research sug￾gests that people in good moods tend to be more creative than people in bad 
moods.158 People in good moods produce more ideas and more options, and 
others think their ideas are original.159 It seems that people experiencing posi￾tive moods or emotions are more flexible and open in their thinking, which 
may explain why they are more creative.160 Supervisors should actively try to 
keep employees happy because doing so creates more good moods (employees 
like their leaders to encourage them and provide positive feedback on a job well 
done), which in turn leads people to be more creative.161
Some researchers, however, do not believe a positive mood makes people 
more creative. They argue that, when people are in positive moods, they may 
relax (“If I am in a good mood, things must be going okay, and I don’t need to 
think of new ideas”) and not engage in the critical thinking necessary for some 
forms of creativity.162 Individuals who worry more may perform better on cre￾ative tasks than those who worry less.
Determining which perspective is correct may lie in thinking of moods some￾what differently. Rather than looking at positive or negative affect, it is possible 
to conceptualize moods as active feelings like anger, fear, or elation and con￾trast these with deactivating moods like sorrow, depression, or serenity. All the 
activating moods, whether positive or negative, seem to lead to more creativity, 
whereas deactivating moods lead to less.163 A study of 428 students found they 
performed best on a creative problem-solving task when they were fatigued, sug￾gesting that tiredness may free the mind to consider novel solutions.164
M04_ROBB0025_19_GE_C04.indd 159 13/12/22 2:05 AM160 PART 2 The Individual
Motivation
Several studies have highlighted the importance of moods and emotions on 
motivation.165 For instance, one study asked two groups of people to solve word 
puzzles. The first group saw a funny video clip intended to put them in a good 
mood first. The other group was not shown the clip and started working on 
the puzzles right away. The positive-mood group reported higher expectations 
of being able to solve the puzzles, worked harder at them, and did solve more 
as a result.166 Another study looked at the moods of insurance sales agents.167
Agents in a good mood were found to be more helpful toward their coworkers 
and felt better about themselves. These factors in turn led to superior perfor￾mance in the form of higher sales and better supervisor reports of performance.
Giving people performance feedback—whether real or fake—influences 
their mood, which then influences their motivation.168 A spiral can be created 
in which positive moods cause people to be more creative, leading to positive 
feedback from those observing their work.169 The feedback further reinforces 
the positive mood, which makes people perform even better, and so on. Overall, 
the findings suggest a manager may enhance employee motivation—and 
performance—by encouraging good moods.
Leadership
Putting people in a good mood makes good sense. Leaders who focus on inspi￾rational goals generate greater optimism, cooperation, and enthusiasm in 
employees, leading to more positive social interactions with coworkers and cus￾tomers.170 A study with Taiwanese military participants indicates that, by sharing 
emotions, transformational leaders inspire positive emotions in their followers 
that in turn lead to higher task performance.171
Leaders are perceived as more effective when they share positive emotions, 
and followers are more creative in a positive emotional environment. What about 
when leaders are sad? Research found that leader displays of sadness increased 
the analytic performance of followers, perhaps because followers attended more

closely to tasks to help the leaders.172 Another interesting study examined more 
than three hundred halftime locker room speeches from high school and college 
basketball teams, finding that leaders’ sharing of negative emotions (e.g., anger) 
can help improve team performance. However, these emotions had to be at the 
right level of intensity—too negative and intense, and the display would back￾fire.173 Leader anger, on the other hand, sparks both anxiety and anger in employ￾ees, paradoxically leading to higher work effort, but also to unethical retaliatory 
behavior, employees speaking up less, or employees leaving the organization.174
Corporate executives know emotional content is critical for employees to 
buy into their vision of the company’s future and accept change.175 When 
higher-ups offer new visions, especially with vague or distant goals, it is often 
difficult for employees to accept the changes they will bring. By arousing emo￾tions and linking them to an appealing vision, leaders may help managers and 
employees alike to accept change and feel connected to the new plan.
Negotiation
Several studies suggest that emotions play a role in negotiation,176 but especially 
anger. In some situations, anger can benefit the negotiator as the opponent may 
conclude that the negotiator has conceded everything they can and so gives 
in.177 In other cases, the opponent may try to diagnose why the negotiator is 
angry, leading to better joint concessions for both parties.178 However, anger 
should be used selectively in negotiation: Angry negotiators who have less infor￾mation or less power than their opponents have significantly worse outcomes,179
such as angry negotiators who refuse to take the opponent’s perspective (which 
could be useful information).180 As in the use of any emotion, context mat￾ters. Displaying a negative emotion (such as anger) can be effective, but feeling 
angry, regretful, or prideful about your performance appears to impair future 
negotiations.181 Individuals who do poorly in negotiation experience negative 
emotions, develop negative perceptions of their counterparts, and are less will￾ing to share information or be cooperative in future negotiations.182
Customer Service
Workers’ emotional states influence the level of customer service they give, 
which in turn influences levels of repeat business and customer satisfaction.183
This result is primarily due to emotional contagion—the “catching” of emotions 
from others.184 When someone experiences positive emotions and laughs and 
smiles at you, like when they are sending you a funny meme about retail life, you 
tend to respond positively. Of course, the opposite is true as well.
Studies indicate a matching effect between employee and customer emo￾tions.185 In the employee-to-customer direction, research finds that customers who 
catch the positive moods or emotions of employees (if they believe they are appro￾priate and authentic) become more satisfied and loyal to the organization, trust 
the organization to a greater degree, and even shop longer.186 In the other direc￾tion, when an employee feels unfairly treated by a customer, it is harder for them 
to display the positive emotions the organization expects.187 High-quality customer 
service makes demands on employees because it often puts them in a state of emo￾tional dissonance, which can be damaging to the employee and the organization. 
Managers can interrupt negative contagion by fostering positive moods.

Work–Life Conflict
There is good news and bad news about the relationship between moods and 
work–life conflict: Both are affected by work and home events. Ever hear the 
advice “Never take your work home with you,” meaning you should forget about 
work once you go home? That is easier said than done, especially now that so many

 Scream Agency: Harnessing Customer 
Emotions to Bolster CSR 
 Some might believe that corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) “speaks 
for itself,” that it is “all about action,” 
and that the authentic practice of 
CSR involves modestly doing what is 
right without concern for the public’s 
response. Furthermore, some might 
believe that the default reaction from 
customers who do become aware of 
an organization’s CSR actions is “eye￾rolling” and automatic dismissal of the 
effort as inauthentic. Adopting both 
mindsets would be a huge missed 
opportunity. First, not committing to 
telling the story of your company’s 
efforts is a missed opportunity to 
reach customers and convince them 
of the importance of the organization’s 
CSR mission. Second, when done well, 
CSR messaging can effectively connect 
with current and potential customers, 
foster loyalty, and even convince cus￾tomers of the importance of the orga￾nizations’ CSR efforts. In other words, 
CSR messaging goes well beyond driv￾ing profits and can be a force for the 
greater good. 
 Meet Scream Agency, an adver￾tising and public relations (PR) firm 
headquartered in Denver, Colorado. Its 
founder, Laura Ledermann, graduated 
from the University of Colorado Boulder 
with a CSR certificate. After graduating, 
Ledermann started Scream Agency to 
develop messaging and tell organiza￾tions’ stories in a way “that’s heard.” 
Like Ben & Jerry’s (spotlighted in the 
introductory chapter’s “Toward a Better 
World”) , Scream is a B-corporation and 
is committed to meeting rigorous social 
and environmental performance as an 
integral part of its business model. 
Scream Agency has worked with many 
companies to tell the story of their 
CSR efforts, including Hyatt Hotels, 
the American Automobile Association 
(AAA), and the Mellow Mushroom piz￾zeria chain. In Scream Agency’s mani￾festo, the company aspires to inspire 
brands to be a change for good. Their 
three-pronged mission is to be seen, 
be heard, and be good (with a heavy 
emphasis on the “good”). As a part 
of its strategy, Scream harnesses the 
power of emotions and EI to better 
connect with customers and employ￾ees. Scream’s approach involves four 
primary purposes: (1) identifying and 
becoming aware of the social problems 
to be solved, (2) preparing messaging 
to inform stakeholders, (3) convincing 
them of the solution, and (4) connect￾ing with the audience’s emotions. 
 Although Scream’s approach makes 
sense in theory, is it evidence-based? 
First, research on Australian corpora￾tions active in climate change efforts 
suggests that marketing and CSR pro￾fessionals play a crucial role. They con￾tribute to the conversation and shape 
public opinion on the issue, making 
the difference between framing it as 
a challenge or an opportunity to make 
a difference. Second, messaging mat￾ters internally. For instance, Hurricane 
Katrina survivors experienced reduced 
job strain as a result of their organiza￾tion’s response to the disaster as well 
as their compassionate messaging. 
Other studies have shown that CSR 
can lead employees to feel proud to 
work where they work and, as a result, 
less likely to leave for other organi￾zations. Lastly, what about custom￾ers? Research demonstrates that the 
nature of CSR messaging has a direct 
emotional impact on customers. For 
instance, a study of more than one 
thousand banking customers in Spain 
found that CSR communication led 
them to feel more positive emotions 
(e.g., happiness, pleasure, and delight) 
and want to identify more with their 
bank. 
 But there are challenges to this 
approach, as emotions do not always 
operate in the way we expect. For 
instance, managers’ and executives’ 
(lack of) emotions matter, too. CSR 
professionals often try to convince 
managers and executives of CSR’s 
business case. Although many may 
agree with the case, they are no less 
likely to do anything about it than 
managers who disagree. The busi￾ness case and “rational justification” 
actually undermine moral emotions. 
Thus, executives are less likely to be 
moved or become angry at the CSR 
problem and are less likely to act. 
Also, we should understand that emo￾tions are not an all-or-nothing proposi￾tion. Customers experience both posi￾tive and negative emotions. Positive 
emotions do not always lead to good 
outcomes. What one employee/cus￾tomer/manager experiences may not 
be valid for the others. For instance, 
not everyone may agree with the orga￾nizations’ interpretation of the CSR 
problem and response, or some may 
question the organization’s credibility 
in dealing with the issue. Managing 
emotions in CSR messaging appears 
to be a challenge. However, profes￾sionals can take an adaptive approach 
to manage employee, manager, and 
customer emotions to realize the 
organization’s CSR mission. 188

people are working from home. The good news is that a positive mood at work can 
apparently spill over to your off-work hours, and a negative mood at work can be 
restored to a positive mood after a break. Several studies have shown that people 
who had a good day at work tend to be in a better mood at home that evening, and 
vice versa.189 Other research has found that, although people do emotionally take 
their work home with them, by the next day the effect is usually gone.190 The bad 
news is that the moods of your household may interfere with yours. As you might 
expect, one study found that if one member of a couple was in a negative mood 
during the workday, the negative mood spilled over to the spouse at night.191
Unethical Workplace Behaviors
Anyone who has spent much time in an organization realizes people can behave 
in ways that violate established norms and threaten the organization, its members, 
or both. As we saw in the introductory chapter, these unethical behaviors (also 
referred to as deviant behaviors) can do a great deal of harm in organizations and 
often take the form of counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs).192 They can be 
traced to negative emotions and can take many forms. People who feel negative 
emotions are more likely than others to engage in short-term deviant behavior at 
work, such as gossiping or excessively surfing the Internet instead of working,193
although negative emotions can also lead to more serious forms of CWB.
For instance, envy is an emotion that occurs when you resent someone for 
having something you do not have but strongly desire—such as a better work 
assignment, larger office, or higher salary. It can lead to malicious deviant 
behaviors. An envious employee could undermine other employees and take all 
the credit for things others accomplished. Angry people look for other people 
to blame for their bad mood, interpret other people’s behavior as hostile, and 
have trouble considering others’ points of view.194 It is also not hard to see how 
these thought processes can lead directly to verbal or physical aggression.
One study found that anger correlated with more aggressive CWBs such as 
abuse against others and production deviance, while sadness did not. Neither 
anger nor sadness predicted workplace withdrawal, which suggests that manag￾ers need to take employee expressions of anger seriously; employees may stay 
with an organization and continue to act aggressively toward others.195 CWBs 
can also lead to a negative emotional spiral, with some employees experiencing 
negative emotions after they engage in CWBs as well.196 These negative emo￾tions can be exacerbated due to social media, as one study demonstrated that 
following a catastrophic event at an organization, negative emotions resonated 
through Facebook like an echo chamber.197 Once aggression starts, it is likely 
that other people will become angry and aggressive, so the stage is set for a seri￾ous escalation of negative behavior. Therefore, managers need to stay connected 
with their employees to gauge emotions and emotional intensity levels. But be 
careful--although many companies have started keeping close track of employ￾ees’ emotions and moods through surveys, and even by analyzing their daily 
email and chat data, many employees find this to be an invasion of privacy.198
Safety and Injury at Work
Bad moods can contribute to injury at work in several ways.199 Individuals in 
negative moods tend to be more anxious, which can make them less able to cope 
effectively with hazards. A person who is always fearful will be more pessimistic 
about the effectiveness of safety precautions because they feel they will just get 
hurt anyway, or might panic or freeze up when confronted with a threatening sit￾uation. Negative moods also make people more distractible, and distractions can 
obviously lead to careless behaviors. For instance, two studies of migrant work￾ers and expatriate military personnel found that negative, longing feelings of 
M04_ROBB0025_19_GE_C04.indd 163 13/12/22 2:06 AM164 PART 2 The Individual
homesickness predicted both job performance and safety behaviors.200 Research 
relating negative affectivity to increased injuries at work suggests employers 
might improve health and safety (and reduce costs) by ensuring that workers 
are not engaged in potentially dangerous activities when they are in a bad mood.
Summary
Emotions and moods are both a part of the affective experience at work. But they 
are also different—moods are more general and longer-lived, where emotions 
are discrete and short-lived. Together, these feelings and experiences comprise 
workers’ positive and negative affect, essential concepts to describe the emotional 
nature of work. Discrete emotions serve various functions, and OB researchers 
categorize them differently. For instance, some emotions are ethically charged in 
response to moral situations. Others serve more basic functions in response to ev￾eryday events. The time of day, stressful events, and sleep patterns are some of the 
factors that influence emotions and moods. Varieties in the experience of emo￾tions and mood highlight that sometimes employers establish norms for desired 
or appropriate emotions on the job. The disconnect between one’s felt emotions 
and displayed emotions and the effort workers expend to maintain them can have 
several implications for employee well-being and productivity. Affectively charged 
work events often trigger these emotions. Affective events theory suggests that 
these events lead to emotional reactions, which impact job satisfaction and job 
performance. What can better equip workers and managers to deal with these un￾predictable work experiences? Research on EI and emotion regulation suggests 
the competencies people can draw upon to manage their (and others’) emotions 
and moods at work. Indeed, affect, emotions, and moods at work have substantial 
implications for several aspects of OB. The “Affective Revolution” is still running 
strong to this day.
Implications for Managers
● Recognize that emotions, mood, and affect are a natural part of the workplace, 
and good management does not mean creating an emotion-free environment.
● Emotional experience is volatile and unpredictable. Just as we often have 
trouble predicting what happens in work life, so, too, do we have trouble 
predicting our emotional responses to what happens. But we can attempt 
to regulate how we react to the events and respond to others’ emotions.
● As a manager, consider how employees may react when announcing a new 
policy or taking action that affects them. You may be the catalyst for an af￾fective event that has emotional consequences. Because of this, you should 
try to anticipate how you could effectively respond to their reactions.
● Surface acting and emotional suppression are generally ineffective strate￾gies for managing ones’ emotions. Deep acting, natural emotional expres￾sion, and cognitive reappraisal may be more effective strategies.
● Work to develop an understanding of the role of emotions and moods to 
significantly improve your ability to explain and regulate your own and 
others’ behavior.
● To foster effective decision making, creativity, and motivation, model posi￾tive emotions and moods as much as is authentically possible.
● In the service sector, encourage authentic, appropriate positive displays of 
emotion, which are “contagious” to customers and improve service inter￾actions and negotiations.

 Sometimes Yelling Is for Everyone’s Good 
POINT 
Anger is discussed throughout this chapter for a reason: It is 
an important emotion. There are benefits to expressing anger. 
 For one, research indicates that only employees who are com￾mitted to their organizations tend to express their anger, and generally 
only to leaders who created the situation. This type of expression 
of anger could lead to positive organizational change. Second, sup￾pressed anger can lower job satisfaction and lead to a feeling of 
hopelessness about things improving. 
 Even with these findings, we hear a lot about not responding emo￾tionally to work challenges. Work cultures teach us to avoid showing 
any anger at all lest we be seen as poor workers or, worse, unprofes￾sional or even deviant or violent. While, of course, there are times 
when the expression of anger is harmful or unprofessional. We have 
taken this view so far that we now teach people to suppress perfectly 
normal emotions and to ignore the effectiveness of some emotional 
expression. 
 Emerging research shows that suppressing anger takes a terrible 
internal toll on individuals. One Stanford University study found, for 
example, that when individuals were asked to wear a poker face dur￾ing the showing of a movie clip depicting the atomic bombings of 
Japan during World War II, they were much more stressed in conversa￾tions after the video. Other research shows that college students who 
suppress emotions like anger have more trouble making friends and 
are more likely to be depressed, and that employees who suppress 
anger feel more stressed by work. 
 For the good of organizations and their employees, we should en￾courage people not to hold back their emotions but to share them 
constructively. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 Y
 es, anger is a common emotion. But it is also a toxic one for 
the giver and the receiver. Angry outbursts can compromise 
the heart and contribute to diabetes, among other ill effects. 
The experience of another’s anger and its close correlate, hostility, is 
also linked to many counterproductive behaviors in organizations. The 
Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 15 percent of fatal work￾place injuries result from workplace violence. That is why many orga￾nizations are implementing conflict management training programs. 
 To prevent violence and counterproductive behavior, many compa￾nies develop policies that prohibit conduct such as yelling, shouting 
profanities, and making hostile gestures. Others institute conflict man￾agement training programs. These programs come in a variety of forms 
and cover a wide range of topics. They often involve one-day work￾shops, small-group facilitations, or one-on-one sessions. The ben￾efit of these programs is that they can help employees who become 
explosively angry and those who exhibit passive-aggressive behavior 
that is also harmful to an organization. In addition to these programs, 
developing strong employee relations can help prevent these types of 
behaviors from occurring in the first place. Careful hiring that consid￾ers a candidate’s demeanor and communication style in addition to 
their experience is also key. 
 In the end, everyone wins when organizations seek to diminish 
both the experience and the expression of anger at work. The work en￾vironment becomes less threatening and stressful to employees and 
customers. Employees are likely to feel safer, and the angry employee 
is often helped as well. 201

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
An understanding or even awareness of others’ emotions 
and moods can help improve your effectiveness in the work￾place. As we have seen, employees react to events as they 
happen in the workplace, and these affective reactions can 
have a large impact on outcomes that are important to or￾ganizations. Employees may need to regulate their emotions 
(especially in positions that require interacting with clients), 
and this regulation may have an impact on employee per￾formance and well-being. Employees may vary on EI, a skill, 
ability, or set of competencies that is related to many out￾comes in the workplace. In this chapter, you have improved 
many skills, including your communication and collabora￾tion skills, by discovering how not all employees experience 
emotional labor in the same way, learning how to build off 
customer emotions to amplify CSR, and discussing the ben￾efits and pitfalls of yelling in the workplace. In the following 
section, you will have more opportunities to develop your 
critical thinking and knowledge application skills by learning 
mindfulness techniques for emotion regulation and stress re￾duction, considering the ethics of data mining, microexpres￾sions of emotion, and considering whether to adapt one’s 
own emotions as a result of performance appraisal feedback.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Mindfulness at Work
The concept of mindfulness emphasizes trying to focus 
your mind in the present moment, immersing yourself 
in what is going on around you. (Mindfulness will be dis￾cussed in depth in the final chapter on organizational 
health and stress.) Core principles include suspend￾ing immediate judgment of the environment and your 
thoughts and keeping yourself open to what is around 
you. The benefits of mindfulness can reach beyond reduc￾ing stress, including increased creativity, longer spans of 
attention, reductions in procrastination, and improved 
performance.
The Procedure
Start this exercise individually and then come together 
into groups of three or four individuals to discuss what 
you have found. Although complete workplace mind￾fulness interventions can take several weeks, some basic 
starting exercises can be done in a relatively short period 
and give you a feeling for what an entire course of mind￾fulness would be like. Here are three simple exercises to 
try. For all these, everyone needs to put everything away 
(especially phones, tablets, and computers!) and focus on 
what is going on in the immediate environment.
• Mindful breathing: Clear your mind of everything except 
thoughts of your breath. Concentrate on how you are 
inhaling and exhaling. It is sometimes helpful to count 
how long each breath takes. Try to maintain this mind￾ful breathing for three minutes. The group will then 
take three minutes to discuss how this made them feel.
• Mindful listening: Now clear your mind of everything 
except what is going on in the immediate environ￾ment. Try to hear as many sounds around you as 
possible without judging or evaluating them. Try to 
maintain this mindful listening for three minutes. The 
group will then take three minutes to discuss some of 
the details they noticed.
• Mindful thinking: As with listening, clear your mind 
of everything, but now focus just on your ideas about 
mindfulness and stress. Do not talk about or write down 
what you are thinking (yet); focus your full quiet atten￾tion on this exercise and what it means. Try to maintain 
this mindful thinking for three minutes. The group will 
then take three minutes to talk about this experience.
As noted earlier, these are brief examples of mindfulness 
exercises. In a complete mindfulness program, you would 
go through several sessions of up to an hour each. Now 
that you have an idea of what it feels like to do mindfulness 
work, consider the following questions in your groups:
4-8. Were there any aspects of the mindfulness 
practice sessions you found especially pleasant or 
helpful? Were there any aspects of the sessions 
that you found unpleasant or uncomfortable?
4-9. What concerns might you have about implement￾ing a mindfulness intervention in the workplace? 
What are some of the obstacles you might face in 
trying to have employees engage in a mindfulness 
stress reduction program?
4-10. Bring the class together and discuss your 
responses.202
ETHICAL DILEMMA Data Mining Emotions
Did anyone ever tell you that you wear your heart on your 
sleeve? It is a popular expression, but obviously, no one is 
looking at your sleeve to read your emotions. Instead, we 
tend to study a person’s facial expressions to “read” their 
emotions. Most of us think we are rather good at read￾ing faces, but we could not say precisely how we make our 
interpretations, and we do not know whether they are ac￾curate. But what if we could use technology to know how 
another person is feeling? Would it be ethical to do so in 
the workplace and then act on our findings?
Technology is not quite ready to do this. Face reading is 
a complex science. Paul Ekman, a noted psychologist, has 
M04_ROBB0025_19_GE_C04.indd 166 13/12/22 2:06 AMEmotions and Moods CHAPTER ­ 167
catapulted the field toward making this dream possible. 
Ekman studied the interpretation of emotions for more than 
forty years and developed a catalog of more than five thou￾sand muscle movements and emotional content. Ekman’s 
work even spawned a television series called Lie to Me. The 
main characters analyzed microexpressions—expressions 
that occur in a fraction of a second—to assist in corporate 
and governmental investigations. Using Ekman’s Facial 
Coding System, technology firms like Emotient Inc. have 
been developing algorithms to match microexpressions to 
emotions. These organizations are currently looking for pat￾terns of microexpressions that might predict behavior.
Honda, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Coca-Cola, and 
Unilever have tried the technology to identify the reac￾tions to new products, with mixed results. For one thing, 
expressions can change instantly, so it is challenging to 
discern which emotions prevail. A person watching a 
commercial, for instance, may smile, furrow their brow, 
and raise their eyebrows all in the space of 30  seconds, 
indicating expressiveness, confusion, and surprise in turn. 
Second, it is difficult to know whether a person will act on 
these fleeting emotions. Third, the technology might mis￾interpret the underlying emotions or their causes.
This technology’s potential applications to the workplace 
include surveillance, gauging reactions to organization an￾nouncements, and lie detection. Cameras could be in every 
meeting room, hallway, and even on employees’ computer 
screens. Emotion monitoring could be an announced event—
say, every Monday from 8 to 9 a.m.—or random. Monitoring 
could be conducted with or without the knowledge of em￾ployees; for instance, data on every employee’s emotional re￾actions in an organizational announcement meeting could be 
read and interpreted through a camera on the wall.
So far, the most reliable workplace application seems to 
be using the technology to capture inconsistencies (lying). 
Even the pioneer of facial emotion recognition, Ekman, 
said, “I can’t control usage [of the technology]. I can only 
be certain that what I’m providing is at least an accurate 
depiction of when someone is concealing emotion.”
There is an ethical consideration and a responsibility for 
each usage, particularly if a manager is going to act on the 
findings or infer the employee’s future behavior. The fact 
that the technology has not yet fully evolved for workplace 
application allows time for ethical guidelines to be devel￾oped. Foremost among the ethical concerns is privacy. 
“I can see few things more invasive than trying to record 
someone’s emotions in a database,” said privacy advocate 
Ginger McCall. Concerns about ethical usage are also 
critical if managers use the technology to make decisions 
about employees—for example, if a manager learns from 
the software that an employee is unhappy and decides to 
look for a work reassignment for the employee when the 
employee is actually unhappy about their spouse. Former 
U.S. counterterrorism detective Charles Lieberman ad￾vises, “Recognize [the technology’s] limitations—it can 
lead you in the right direction but is not definitive.”

CASE INCIDENT Performance Review Shock: Being Told How to Feel and Act
You have your annual review meeting with your supervisor 
today. Given that you met all your sales goals this year, you 
were hopeful that this would mean a promotion. During 
the meeting, your supervisor praises your work ethic and 
recognizes that you have been a valuable asset to the com￾pany despite only a two-year tenure. However, your super￾visor ends the meeting with one significant critique to your 
dismay: You do not seem happy enough and should smile 
more. Your supervisor continues, explaining that many of 
the senior executives at the company perceive you as un￾friendly. “You just need to work on your EI, that’s all,” your 
supervisor says. You are so taken aback by this comment 
that all you can say is, “Okay ... I will work on that.”
It had not even occurred to you that your demeanor 
would be scrutinized or even considered to be part of your 
job performance. In fact, as one of the youngest employees 
at the company, you had to put a lot of effort into being 
taken seriously. As a result, you always tried to act profes￾sionally, but now it seems like that may have backfired. 
The more you think about it, the more frustrated you be￾come. If you meet or exceed the sales metrics, what should 
it matter whether you smile? Besides, what is EI anyway? 
Everyone talks about it in magazines and newspapers. Still, 
no one can seem to give a straight answer as to what it 
means. However, if your “unfriendly” demeanor is the only 
thing standing between you and a promotion, perhaps you 
should try to smile more and be friendlier when the senior 
executives are around. But then that might mean people 
could take advantage of you, and you are not sure you can 
try to be something you are not. It just feels so inauthentic 
and fake.
Questions
4-14. Do you agree that your demeanor at work is 
important? Do you think its importance varies 
across situations, contexts, and jobs? Explain.
4-15. What role, if any, do you think EI plays in this 
situation?
4-16. Could the supervisor have done anything differ￾ently to help you understand the feedback and 
assist you in using it constructively?
4-17. What would you do in this situation, and why?204

 THE RISE AND FALL OF THERANOS 
Many of the best leaders can communicate their vision and inspire 
people to pursue a common goal. Some of the traits that best 
predict these behaviors may be essential for effective leadership, such as 
a charismatic personality. However, traits often associated with influential 
leadership, including confidence, charisma, and willingness to take risks, are 
also strongly related to narcissism. Specifically, grandiose narcissists tend 
to be confident, extroverted, and self-promoting, often helping them assume 
authority positions in organizations. In extreme cases, narcissism can lead 
to abuse, exploitation, and ethical misconduct. The question is: How can we 
tell the difference between a leader who is authentically inspiring people to 
pursue a common goal and a narcissistic leader with a hidden agenda? The 
answer is that it can be difficult. 
 The rise and fall of Theranos provides an excellent example of the 
interplay between narcissistic personality traits and leadership. Elizabeth 
Holmes, CEO of the now-defunct company, was once heralded as the next 
Steve Jobs. At nineteen, she dropped out of Stanford with an ambitious 
vision to start Theranos, a consumer health care technology startup. At one 
point, the company was valued at $9 billion. Holmes achieved this success 
by convincing many powerful and influential people that her company would 
revolutionize the health care industry. With just a few drops of blood, the 
company’s technology could supposedly run hundreds of tests. But it turns 
out Theranos’s technology was too good to be true. Holmes and the former 
president of Theranos, Sunny Balwani, now face federal fraud charges for 
engaging in schemes to defraud investors, doctors, and patients.

Many now wonder how Holmes could pull off such a large-scale deception 
and convince so many seemingly intelligent and influential people to believe 
it. It appears that Holmes’s skill for storytelling and her passion allowed her 
to persuade investors and others to believe in the technology. Holmes would 
frequently tell others about her uncle, who was diagnosed with skin cancer 
that rapidly spread, eventually leading to his death. Holmes hoped that her 
company’s blood-testing technology could prevent this from happening to 
other families. Unfortunately, the case against Holmes shows that she was 
likely motivated more by fame and money than revolutionizing the health care 
industry and saving lives.
However, narcissism may not be an entirely negative trait. For example, 
leadership expert Michael Maccoby believes that there are “productive 
narcissists,” or leaders with a certain degree of narcissism that allows them 
to achieve their idealistic visions. Maccoby asserts that many respected and 
influential leaders in history, like the pioneers of the technological revolution 
Andy Grove, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates, were productive narcissists. Without 
this trait, these leaders would lack the confidence to convince others of their 
abilities and ideas.
On the other hand, some scholars see true narcissistic leaders as 
damaging to organizations. Field studies have shown that narcissistic CEOs 
are more likely to engage in fraud and white-collar crime. Furthermore, 
when in powerful positions, narcissistic CEOs tend to fire or ignore those 
who challenge them. Charles O’Reilly, a researcher who studies how CEOs’ 
personalities shape organizations, believes there is a key to determining if 
someone is a productive or destructive narcissist. Organizations often only 
rely upon interviews and other hiring methods, which a narcissistic leader can 
easily manipulate. Instead, gathering testimonies or ratings of the leader’s 
personality from individuals who worked with them can be revealing. These 
other sources of information could ultimately save the organization from a 
narcissistic leader’s potentially disastrous influence.1
Personality is indeed a strong factor for many life and work outcomes. 
Personality plays a major role in success in the workplace, although the effects 
are not always direct; sometimes they are nuanced. We will explain extroversion, 
conscientiousness, openness, agreeableness, and emotional stability: the traits 
that comprise the Big Five, the most well-defined and supported personality 
framework to date. We will also review frameworks that describe an individual’s 
personality and tendencies.
Linking Individuals to the Workplace
Years ago, organizations were concerned with personality, in part because they 
used it to match individuals to specific jobs. That concern has expanded to 
include how well the individual’s personality and values match the organization. 
5-1 Describe the differences 
between person–job fit and 
person–organization fit.
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 170 13/12/22 2:39 AMPersonality and Individual Differences CHAPTER 5 171
Why? Because managers today are less interested in an applicant’s ability to 
perform a specific job than with the ability to further the organization’s mission 
and to retain the employee (rather than leaving for another organization).2
For example, Twegos, a firm that provides a person–organization value fit 
assessment, assesses truck driver fit with their carrier, trainers, dispatchers, and 
managers in order to increase engagement and reduce turnover.3
 Still, one of 
the first types of fit managers look for is person–job fit.
Person–Job Fit
The effort to match job requirements with personality characteristics is 
described by John Holland’s personality–job fit theory, one of the more proven 
theories in use internationally.4
 The Vocational Preference Inventory question￾naire contains 160 occupational titles. Respondents indicate which they like or 
dislike, and their answers form occupation interest profiles. Holland presented 
six personality types (see the following section on personality) and proposed 
that satisfaction and the propensity to leave a position depend on how well indi￾viduals match their personalities to a job. Exhibit 5-1 describes the six types, 
their personality characteristics, and examples of the congruent occupations 
for each. Notably, this theory tends to be supported with person–job fit strongly 
predicting job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intentions to quit.5
There are diversity implications for person–job fit that speak to workers’ 
expectations that jobs will be tailored to them. In individualistic countries 
where workers expect to be heard and respected by management, increasing 
person–job fit by tailoring the job to the person increases the individual’s job 
satisfaction. However, in collectivistic countries, person–job fit is a weaker pre￾dictor of job satisfaction because people do not expect to have a job tailored 
to them, so they value person–job fit efforts less.6
 Therefore, managers in col￾lectivistic cultures should not violate cultural norms by designing jobs for indi￾viduals; rather, they should seek people who will likely thrive in jobs that have 
already been structured.7
 Furthermore, research suggests that giving workers 
more autonomy in designing their jobs to match their strengths and interests 
may be more effective for older employees than younger ones. As employees 
age, they become more aware of their own strengths and interests, meaning that 
giving them the opportunity to fit the job to their interests, personalities, and 
strengths can be an effective approach.8

identifies six personality types and proposes 
that the fit between personality type and 
occupational environment determines 
satisfaction and turnover.

Person–Organization Fit
We have noted that researchers have looked at matching people to organizations 
and jobs. If an organization has a dynamic and changing environment and 
needs employees able to change tasks readily and move easily between teams, 
it is more important that employees’ personalities and individual differences 
fit with the overall organization’s culture than with the characteristics of any 
specific job.
Person–organization fit essentially means that people are attracted to and 
are selected by organizations that match their values (discussed later in this 
chapter) and they leave organizations that are not compatible with them.9
For instance, we could expect that extroverts fit well with organizations that 
value relationships and socialization.10 Following these guidelines when hiring 
should yield employees who fit better with the organization, which should, in 
turn, result in higher employee satisfaction and reduced turnover.11 Research 
on person–organization fit also looked at whether people’s values match the 
organization’s culture (see the chapter on organizational culture and change). 
A match predicts high job satisfaction and commitment to the organization as 
well as low turnover.12 Interestingly, new research suggests that people tend to 
care more about how well an organization’s values would be preferred by the 
typical person rather than one’s own idiosyncratic preferences for values in an 
organization.13 Furthermore, their fit perceptions do not involve comparing 
themselves to others or logically basing their opinions on how jobs make them 
feel. Rather, they are relatively automatic judgments that involve both affective 
reactions and feelings (e.g., attitudes).14
It is more important than ever for organizations to manage their image 
online because job seekers view company websites and social media presence 
as part of their pre-application process.15 Applicants want to see a user-friendly 
website or social media page that provides information about company policies, 
philosophies, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts.16 These websites 
are so important to the development of perceived person–organization fit that 
improvements to their style (usability) and substance (policies) can lead to more 
applicants.17 Furthermore, one study examined organizations’ or founders’ 
communication on social media and, more specifically, whether they displayed 
religious values. Applicants who shared the same religious values as the founder 
or organization were more likely to apply to the job, although most applicants 
were less likely to apply to the job if the company messaged about its religious 
values.18 This study conveys how values communicated via social media can also 
affect applicant and employee fit perceptions.

people are attracted to and selected by 
organizations that match their values and 
leave when there is no compatibility.
Other Dimensions of Fit
Although person–job fit and person–organization fit are considered the most 
salient dimensions for workplace outcomes, other avenues of fit are worth exam￾ining. These include person–group fit and person–supervisor fit.
20 Person–group 
fit is important in team settings, where the dynamics of team interactions sig￾nificantly affect work outcomes. Person–supervisor fit has become an important 
area of research because poor fit in this dimension can lead to lower job satisfac￾tion and reduced performance. There is even some truth to the phrase “misery 
loves company,” as some research suggests that congruence between leader and 
follower cynicism predicts follower job performance.21
All dimensions of fit are sometimes broadly referred to as person–
environment fit. Each dimension can predict work attitudes, which are par￾tially based on culture. A meta-analysis of person–environment fit in East 
Asia, Europe, and North America suggested that the dimensions of person–
organization and person–job fit are the strongest predictors of positive work 
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 172 13/12/22 2:39 AMPersonality and Individual Differences CHAPTER 5 173
attitudes and performance in North America. These dimensions are impor￾tant to a lesser degree in Europe, and they are the least important in East 
Asia. 22 Organizational leaders’ can manage employees’ perceptions of fit, 
even for jobs that many people do not want (e.g., dirty work), by match￾ing employee individual differences to the job, providing realistic pre￾views of the work and organization, training and socialization to help new 
employees navigate the job/organization, and providing ongoing support to 
employees. 23 
 Uber: In the Median or Back on the Road Again? 
 When you think about CSR and sustain￾ability, you probably do not think about 
Uber. Instead, you probably think of the 
appalling press it has received over the 
years, which prompted the #deleteuber 
tag circulating on social media. Uber has 
been burdened with so many scandals 
that researchers and reporters created 
timelines, overviews, and even a website 
to document them. Many have looked to 
Uber’s founder and former CEO, Travis 
Kalanick, as the potential wellspring for 
these scandals. Kalanick established a 
toxic, win-at-all-costs, “tech bro” work￾place. In 2017 he was forced to step 
down as CEO following several scan￾dals, and at the end of 2019 Kalanick 
stepped down from the board. 
 Enter Dara Khosrowshahi. The cur￾rent CEO of Uber has had his work 
cut out for him. He made it clear that 
Kalanick would not be involved in the 
day-to-day running of Uber. He stressed 
that he would work to clean up the 
company’s image and transform the 
culture under his leadership. Even 
the circumstances surrounding the 
appointment of a new CEO were scan￾dalous. Khosrowshahi was not origi￾nally a front-runner in the hiring pro￾cess. In fact, one firm promised to drop 
a lawsuit against Uber if it appointed 
an alternative, favored front-runner as 
CEO (which many on the board saw as 
blackmail). This action caused support 
for this front-runner candidate to switch 
to Khosrowshahi, ultimately leading 
him to become CEO. 
 Years after his appointment, 
Khosrowshahi led an effort to replace 
Uber’s fourteen corporate values in 
2017. The U.S. attorney general and 
his law firm recommended this action 
following an investigation of Uber’s 
internal practices. Many believed that 
the original values encouraged, rein￾forced, and justified unethical behavior 
at all organizational levels. These values 
included vague platitudes like “super￾pumpedness,” “always be hustling,” 
“ toe-stepping,” and “champion’s mind￾set” that seemed to encourage conflict 
and unethical behavior. Khosrowshahi 
noted that Uber’s culture needed 
to change from one that embraces 
growth, no matter the cost, toward one 
that embraces responsible and sus￾tainable growth. To accomplish this, 
Khosrowshahi elicited submissions of 
replacement values from more than a 
thousand employees, which were voted 
on more than twenty thousand times 
by employees at the company. He also 
commissioned twenty workgroups to 
help define and refine them. The new 
values are direct and leave little room 
for interpretation, including: “We do the 
right thing. Period.” “We celebrate dif￾ferences . . . ensure people of diverse 
backgrounds feel welcome.” “We value 
ideas over hierarchy.” This approach 
was interesting because it started with 
the people . Often, when CEOs assume 
power, they set the values themselves 
and transmit them from the top down. 
However, critics have suggested that 
changing values on paper is not enough. 
As Fred Perrotta (CEO of Tortuga) com￾mented, “Your values are what you live , 
not what you write .” Values in many ways 
underlie organizational behavior, leading 
people within organizations to attract, 
select, and retain people who fit with 
those values. Therefore, Uber needs to 
put into practice what it writes on paper. 
 Although Uber has made steps in 
the right direction, image is everything. 
The data shows that Uber is still strug￾gling with its reputation and image. 
Brand sentiment is still low, and it is 
still struggling to win back custom￾ers. However, there are some wins to 
be found. For instance, Uber’s current 
value of diversity and inclusion may 
have led the company toward its perfect 
score on the 2020 Corporate Equality 
Index. Furthermore, Uber has made 
efforts to establish and continuously 
improve CSR initiatives. Its competi￾tion, Lyft, continues to outshine Uber 
in its CSR-related communication and 
messaging, which is incredibly impor￾tant for reinforcing the values to con￾sumers. It is unclear whether Uber will 
regain traction or yet again spin out. 
However, Uber’s case makes it abun￾dantly clear that leadership and values 
play a vital role in CSR. Employees 
need to be actively engaged to realize 
CSR goals fully. Employees and manag￾ers alike need to recognize that core 
values become a part of the company’s 
DNA and the DNA of the people who 
comprise the company. 19
 Toward a Better World 
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 173 13/12/22 2:39 AM174 PART 2 The Individual
Personality
The needs of a business are broad and varied. People are needed to keep track 
of accounting and finance, to ensure that the right employees are hired and 
that training needs are met, to market and sell the products or services the 
company provides, to research and develop better ways of doing things, and 
so on. Consider this: If every employee you hired was the same and had identi￾cal personalities, would they all be equally effective at meeting these needs?24
Before we can answer this question, we need to address a more basic one: What 
is personality?
What Is Personality?
When we speak of someone’s personality, we use many adjectives to describe 
how they act and seem to think; in one study, participants used 624 distinct 
adjectives to describe people they knew.25 Thinking of one of your coworkers, 
you might think they are “fun,” “outgoing,” “nice,” or “hard-working,” or maybe 
you think they are “lazy,” “aloof,” “close-minded,” or “nosy.” In organizational 
behavior (OB), we organize these characteristics into overall traits describing a 
person’s personality.
Defining Personality For our purposes, think of personality as the sum of ways 
in which an individual reacts to and interacts with the world around them. 
We most often describe personality in terms of the measurable traits a person 
exhibits.
Early work on personality tried to identify and label all the enduring char￾acteristics, such as the adjectives you listed previously to describe a coworker, 
that describe an individual’s behavior. When someone frequently exhibits these 
characteristics across many situations and when they are relatively enduring 
over time, we call them personality traits.
26 The more consistent the character￾istic over time and the more frequently it occurs in various situations, the more 
important the trait is in describing the individual.

way it is measured, and the

Person–organization fit is important 
to Sheila Marcelo, founder and CEO 
of Care.com, an online sitter and 
care service. Marcelo seeks to hire 
employees who share the company’s 
culture of helping others and who are 
passionate about working on projects 
that achieve Care.com’s mission of 
improving the lives of families and 
caregivers.
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 174 13/12/22 2:39 AMPersonality and Individual Differences CHAPTER 5 175
 Our culture influences the way we describe ourselves and others. Although 
many personality traits do tend to emerge across cultures (see the Big Five 
Model later in this chapter), 27 it appears that some traits do not emerge in cer￾tain cultures—moreover, certain unique personality traits might emerge. 28 For 
instance, research in Chinese contexts has uncovered unique traits that focus 
on interpersonal relatedness as well as a relative absence of openness traits. 29 As 
such, when interacting with people from other cultures, it is imperative to keep 
in mind that there may be cultural differences even when it comes to personalities . 
Measuring Personality Personality assessments have been increasingly used in 
diverse organizational settings. In fact, 89 of the Fortune 100 companies and 
57 percent of all large U.S. companies use them, 30 including Xerox, McDonald’s, 
and Lowe’s. 31 In addition, an estimated 200 federal agencies pay for personality 
testing as part of their training programs. 32 Personality tests are useful in hiring 
decisions and help managers forecast who is best for a job. 33 Furthermore, you 
might think that personality tests are really only used to hire middle managers 
and executives. However, more and more organizations are beginning to use 
personality tests to hire both full-time and hourly employees (see OB Poll). 34
 The most common means of measuring personality is through self-report 
surveys in which individuals evaluate themselves on a series of factors, such as 
“I worry a lot about the future.” 35 In general, when people know their per￾sonality scores are going to be used for hiring decisions, they rate themselves 
much higher on desirable traits (e.g., conscientiousness) than if they are taking 
the test to learn more about themselves. 36 This presents a problem of appli￾cants and candidates “faking” their responses to the personality test, although 
there are ways to design personality tests to lower the chances this will happen. 37
Another problem is accuracy; 38 for instance, personality ratings from someone 
who knows you well (e.g., someone you have worked with for five years) might 
be more accurate than ratings given by a relative stranger to you. 39

Observer-ratings surveys provide an independent assessment of personality. 
Here, a coworker or another observer does the rating. Though the results of 
self-reports and observer-ratings surveys are strongly correlated, research sug￾gests that observer-ratings surveys predict job success more than self-ratings 
alone.40 However, each can tell us something unique about an individual’s 
behavior, so a combination of self-reports and observer reports predicts per￾formance better than any one type of information. What makes for a good 
observer? Emotional intelligence (see the chapter on emotions and mood) 
may play a role here: One study found that accuracy in judging negative versus 
positive emotional displays played a role in how accurately observers judged 
emotional stability versus extroversion, respectively.41
Modern advancements in technology and artificial intelligence (AI) (e.g., 
machine learning; see introductory chapter) have also improved the ability to 
score personality tests, reduce faking, and adaptively present items for more 
accurate personality assessment. For example, machine learning has been 
used to select the most informative questions for traditional personality tests,42
detecting people who fake personality tests,43 measuring personality through 
the actual language and words people use on social media,44 and even scoring 
job applicants’ personal essays!45
Personality Frameworks
Throughout history, people have sought to understand what makes individuals 
behave in different ways. Many of our behaviors stem from our personalities, 
so understanding the components of personality helps us predict behavior. For 
example, an employee who is low on tact as a personality trait (a characteristic of 
“agreeableness”) may be more likely to be rude or direct at inappropriate times, 
which can in turn upset or anger coworkers.46 Theoretical frameworks and 
assessment tools help us categorize and study these dimensions of personality.
The most widely used and best-known personality frameworks are the 
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Big Five Model. Both describe 
a person’s total personality through exploration of the facets of personality. 
However, the Myers-Briggs has little empirical support for its use, whereas the 
Big Five is built on a solid foundation of decades of research. (Clearly, evidence￾based practitioners and managers would do well to consider the Big Five over 
the MBTI.) Other frameworks, such as the Dark Triad, explain certain aspects, 
but not the total, of an individual’s personality. We discuss each in the following 
sections, but let’s begin with the dominant frameworks.
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is the most widely used personality 
assessment instrument in the world.47 It is a one-hundred-question personality 
test that asks people how they usually feel or act in situations. Respondents are 
classified as extroverted or introverted (E or I), sensing or intuitive (S or N), 
thinking or feeling (T or F), and judging or perceiving (J or P):
• Extroverted (E) versus Introverted (I). Extroverted individuals are outgoing, 
sociable, and assertive. Introverts are quiet and shy.
• Sensing (S) versus Intuitive (N). Sensing types are practical and prefer rou￾tine and order, and they focus on details. Intuitives rely on unconscious 
processes and look at the big picture.
• Thinking (T) versus Feeling (F). Thinking types use reason and logic to han￾dle problems. Feeling types rely on their personal values and emotions.
• Judging (J) versus Perceiving (P). Judging types want control and prefer 
order and structure. Perceiving types are flexible and spontaneous.
5-3 Describe the strengths and 
weaknesses of the Myers￾Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) 
personality framework, the 
Big Five Model, and the 
Dark Triad.
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) A 
personality test that taps four characteristics 
and classifies people into one of sixteen 
personality types.
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 176 13/12/22 2:39 AMPersonality and Individual Differences CHAPTER 5 177
The MBTI describes personality types by identifying one trait (e.g., extrover￾sion) from each of the four pairs (e.g., extroversion-introversion) and combining 
them to form a personality type. For example, Introverted/Intuitive/Thinking/
Judging people (INTJs) are visionaries with original minds and great drive. They 
are skeptical, critical, independent, determined, and often stubborn.
There are a litany of problems with the use of the MBTI.48 First, the MBTI 
was developed in a rather unscientific, subjective way based on Carl Jung’s 
neo-Freudian theories. Although popular and historically influential, very little 
empirical evidence and research actually support the theory the MBTI is based 
on. As Professor Ronald Riggio notes, “Jung’s theories are not considered to be 
solid. He wasn’t an empiricist. He didn’t collect data.”49 Second, evidence does 
not support the validity of the MBTI as a measure of personality; in fact, most 
of the evidence is against it.50 As Professor Dan Ariely sardonically noted about 
MBTI results, “Next time, just look at the horoscope. It is just as valid and takes 
less time.”51 Third, the MBTI forces a person into one type or another; that is, you 
are either introverted or extroverted. There is no in-between. Fourth, when peo￾ple retake the assessment, they often receive different results. An additional prob￾lem is in the difficulty of interpretation. There are levels of importance for each 
of the MBTI facets, and there are separate meanings for certain combinations of 
facets, all of which require trained interpretation that can leave room for error.
If the MBTI is such a terrible personality measure, why do so many people 
still use it? In Professor Merve Emre’s book on the history of the MBTI, Emre 
suggests the test is written to be so nonjudgmental that no matter what you 
select, the results are desirable and appealing. The test also satisfies a desire 
to know more about yourself in a simple, easy way. As such, the MBTI crafts a 
very “appealing fantasy” of a coherent understanding of “who you are” and 
how to maximize your potential using this knowledge.52 As a final issue with the 
MBTI that directly concerns the study of OB, the MBTI does not predict job 
performance or other important organizational outcomes. Because results tend 
to be unrelated to job performance, managers should consider using the Big 
Five Personality Model, discussed next, as the personality selection test for job 
candidates instead.
The Big Five Personality Model
The MBTI may lack strong supporting evidence, but an impressive body of 
research supports the Big Five Model, which proposes that five basic dimen￾sions encompass most of the differences in human personality.53 Test scores 
of these traits do a very good job of predicting how people behave in a variety 
of real-life situations54 and remain relatively stable for an individual over time, 
with some daily variations.55 These are the Big Five factors:
• Conscientiousness. The conscientiousness dimension is a measure of per￾sonal consistency and reliability. A highly conscientious person is respon￾sible, organized, dependable, and persistent. Those who score low on this 
dimension are easily distracted, disorganized, and unreliable.
• Emotional stability. The emotional stability dimension taps a person’s abil￾ity to withstand stress. People with emotional stability tend to be calm, 
self-confident, and secure. High scorers are more likely to be positive and 
optimistic and experience fewer negative emotions (e.g., nervousness, 
anxiety, insecurity); they are generally happier than low scorers.
• Extroversion. The extroversion dimension captures our relational ap￾proach toward the social world. Extroverts tend to be gregarious, assertive, 
and sociable. They experience more positive emotions than do introverts, 
and they more freely express these feelings. On the other hand, introverts 
(low extroversion) tend to be more thoughtful, reserved, timid, and quiet.

• Openness to experience. The openness to experience dimension addresses 
the range of a person’s interests and their fascination with novelty. 
Open people are creative, curious, and artistically sensitive. Those at 
the low end of the category are conventional and find comfort in the 
familiar.
• Agreeableness. The agreeableness dimension refers to an individual’s 
propensity to defer to others. Agreeable people are cooperative, warm, 
and trusting. You might expect agreeable people to be happier than dis￾agreeable people. They are, but only slightly. When people choose or￾ganizational team members, agreeable individuals are usually their first 
choice. In contrast, people who score low on agreeableness are cold and 
antagonistic.
How Do the Big Five Traits Predict Behavior at Work? There are many relation￾ships between the Big Five personality dimensions and job performance,56 and 
we are learning more about them every day. Let’s explore one trait at a time, 
beginning with the strongest predictor of job performance—conscientiousness.
Conscientiousness at Work Researchers have stated, “Personal attributes 
related to conscientiousness. . . are important for success across many jobs, 
spanning across low to high levels of job complexity, training, and experi￾ence.”57 Employees who score higher in conscientiousness develop higher 
levels of job knowledge, probably because highly conscientious people learn 
more (conscientiousness may be related to grade point average [GPA]),58
and these levels correspond with higher levels of job performance and orga￾nizational citizenship behavior (OCB; see the introductory chapter).59
Conscientious people are also less likely to engage in counterproductive work 
behaviors (CWBs),60 think less about leaving their organizations, and can adapt 
to changing task demands and situations.61 Conscientious people also engage 
in less unsafe behavior and tend to have fewer accidents than those who are 
less conscientious.62

General Motors CEO Mary Barra 
is unusual in that Barra appears 
to score high on all the Big Five 
personality dimensions. This unique 
combination of traits perhaps guided 
Barra to become the first woman CEO 
of a major global automaker.
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 178 13/12/22 2:39 AMPersonality and Individual Differences CHAPTER 5 179
Conscientiousness is important to overall organizational success. As 
Exhibit 5-2 shows, a study of the personality scores of 313 chief executive offi￾cer (CEO) candidates in private equity companies (of whom 225 were hired) 
found conscientiousness—in the form of persistence, attention to detail, and 
setting high standards—was more important to success than other traits.63
Like any trait, conscientiousness has pitfalls. Extremely conscientious individ￾uals can be too deliberate and perfectionistic, resulting in diminished happi￾ness and performance, which includes task performance, safety performance, 
and OCB.64 They may also become too focused on their own work to help 
others in the organization.65 Finally, they are often less creative, especially 
artistically.66
Conscientiousness is the best overall predictor of job performance. However, 
the other Big Five traits are also related to aspects of performance and have 
other implications for work and for life, as Exhibit 5-3 summarizes.
Emotional Stability at Work Of the Big Five traits, emotional stability is most 
strongly related to life satisfaction and job satisfaction as well as reduced burnout 
and intentions to quit.67 People with high emotional stability can adapt to unex￾pected or changing demands in the workplace.68 At the other end of the spec￾trum, individuals with low emotional stability, who may be unable to cope with 
these demands, may experience burnout.69 These people also tend to experience 
work–family conflict and ostracism, which can affect work outcomes.70 Given these 
straining effects, employees low on emotional stability are more likely to engage in 
CWBs, less likely to engage in OCBs, and less likely to be motivated at work.71
Extroversion at Work People with extroverted personality traits experience a small, 
persistent advantage in their jobs and in their careers. A review of a whopping 97 
published meta-analyses strongly supports the “extrovert advantage,” which is pri￾marily due to the positive emotions that extroverts tend to experience (and not 
primarily due to their adeptness in social interaction, like one might assume).72 
Extroverts tend to be able to better adapt to career changes (e.g., finding a job after 
a termination).73 Furthermore, extroverts experience generally high job satisfac￾tion and reduced burnout.74 At the group and team level, extroversion is a relatively 
strong predictor of leadership emergence and behaviors in groups.75 However, 
extroverts can appear to be dominating and are prone to risk-taking, which can be 
disadvantageous for jobs that do not require frequent social interaction.76
Openness at Work Open people tend to be creative and innovative77 and are 
more likely to be effective leaders and more comfortable with ambiguity—they

cope better with organizational change and are more adaptable.78 While open￾ness is not related to initial performance on a job, individuals higher in open￾ness are less susceptible to a decline in performance over a longer time period.79
Open people also experience less work–family conflict.80
Agreeableness at Work Agreeable individuals tend to do better in interperson￾ally oriented jobs such as customer service. They experience less work–family 
conflict and are less susceptible to turnover.81 They also engage in a high degree 
of OCBs82 and a low degree of CWBs83 and are less likely to be ostracized by 
their work groups.84 Lastly, agreeableness is associated with lower levels of 
career success (especially earnings), perhaps because highly agreeable people 
are less willing to assert themselves.85
Interestingly, agreeableness might be more important for organizational 
commitment (see the chapter on attitudes and job satisfaction) in some cul￾tures. One review of research on nearly twenty thousand employees worldwide 
found that agreeableness was more predictive of organizational commitment in 
collectivistic cultures rather than individualistic cultures (see later in this chap￾ter for more information on collectivistic versus individualistic cultures).86
Furthermore, given that more companies are sending their employees 
on global assignments, it is important to understand which other personality 
traits are most important for adjusting to living in different cultures. Research 
suggests that extroversion is the most important trait predicting expatriate 
adjustment, followed by emotional stability and openness.87 A study on 2,500 
international exchange students worldwide corroborated this, with extroversion

significantly reducing the stress of being in a new culture and improving cul￾tural adaptation.88
Research indicates that the Big Five traits have the most verifiable links to 
important organizational outcomes, but they are not the only traits a person 
exhibits, nor are they the only ones with OB implications. Let us discuss some 
other traits, known collectively as the Dark Triad.
The Dark Triad
Outside the Big Five framework, researchers have identified three other socially 
undesirable traits, which we all have in varying degrees: Machiavellianism, narcis￾sism, and psychopathy. Owing to their negative nature, researchers have labeled 
these the Dark Triad—though they do not always occur together.89 In reviewing 
these traits, you might remember coworkers or bosses you have had previously 
who could be characterized by these traits and the consequences these traits 
had in your workplace. These traits can literally harm an organization’s financial 
performance. For example, one study of 101 hedge fund managers found that 
those who were narcissistic and psychopathic tended to have worse financial 
performance than their peers.90 These traits might not be as far removed as 
you think; after all, “not all psychopaths are in prison—some are in the board 
room.”91
The Dark Triad may sound sinister, but these traits are not clinical patholo￾gies. They might be expressed particularly strongly when an individual is under 
stress and unable to moderate any inappropriate responses. Although dark per￾sonality traits can have their upsides in certain situations (at least in the short 
term),92 sustained high levels of dark personality traits can cause individuals to 
derail their careers and personal lives.93
Machiavellianism Aiden is a young bank manager in Shanghai. Aiden has 
received three promotions in the past four years and makes no apologies for 
using aggressive tactics. “I do whatever I have to do to get ahead,” Aiden says. 
Aiden would be termed Machiavellian.
The personality characteristic of Machiavellianism (often abbreviated Mach) 
is named after Niccolò Machiavelli, who wrote in the sixteenth century about 
how to gain and use power. An individual high in Machiavellianism is prag￾matic, maintains emotional distance, and believes ends can justify means. “If 
it works, use it” is consistent with a high-Mach perspective. High Machs manip￾ulate more, win more, and are persuaded less by others but persuade others 
more than do low Machs.94 They are more likely to act aggressively and engage 
in CWBs and, perhaps less obviously, will even engage in OCBs if it is instrumen￾tal in acquiring more power or status.95 Surprisingly, Machiavellianism does not 
positively predict overall job performance.96 High-Mach employees, by manipu￾lating others to their advantage, win in the short term at a job, but they lose 
those gains in the long term because they are not well liked.
There are ethical implications for Machiavellians’ behavior. High-Mach 
job seekers were less positively affected by the knowledge that an organization 
engaged in a high level of CSR,97 suggesting that high-Mach people may care 
less about sustainability issues. Machs’ ethical leadership behaviors are also 
less likely to translate into followers’ work engagement because followers see 
through these behaviors and realize that they are a case of surface acting (see 
the chapter on emotions and moods).

Narcissism Avery likes to be the center of attention. Avery thinks of Avery as 
having a very large number of talents (“See, even ‘a very’ can be found in my 
name!” Avery says) and having a grandiose and profound influence on others 
Dark Triad A constellation of 
negative personality traits consisting 
of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and 
psychopathy.
Machiavellianism The degree to which an 
individual is pragmatic, maintains emotional 
distance, and believes that ends can justify 
means.

and is very sensitive to criticism. Avery is a narcissist. The trait is named for 
the Greek myth about Narcissus, a youth so vain and proud he fell in love with 
his own image. Narcissism describes a person who has a grandiose sense of 
self-importance, requires excessive admiration, and is arrogant. Narcissists often 
have fantasies of grand success, a tendency to exploit situations and people, a 
sense of entitlement, and a lack of empathy.99 However, narcissists can also be 
hypersensitive and fragile.100
While narcissism seems to be relatively unrelated to job effectiveness or OCB 
(except when it makes them look good),101 it is one of the largest predictors of 
increased CWB in individualistic cultures—but not in collectivist cultures that 
discourage self-promotion.102 Narcissists commonly think they are overqualified 
for their positions.103 When they receive feedback about their performance, 
they often tune out information that conflicts with their positive self-perception, 
but they will work harder if rewards are offered.104 Narcissist managers are even 
selective about the relationships they form with their subordinates, often pri￾oritizing those who give positive, noncritical feedback (ultimately reducing the 
voice of all subordinates).105 Research using data compiled over one hundred 
years has shown that narcissistic CEOs of baseball organizations generate higher 
levels of manager turnover, although members of external organizations see 
them as more influential.106
On the bright side, narcissists may be more charismatic than others.107 They 
are more likely to be chosen for leadership positions, and medium ratings of 
narcissism (neither extremely high nor extremely low) are positively correlated 
with leadership effectiveness.108 Some evidence suggests that narcissists are 
more adaptable and make better business decisions than others when the issue 
is complex.109
Narcissism and its effects are not confined to CEOs or celebrities. Like the 
effects of Machiavellianism, those of narcissism vary by context but are evident 
in all areas of life.
Psychopathy Psychopathy is part of the Dark Triad, but in OB, it does not con￾note clinical mental illness. In the OB context, psychopathy is defined as a lack 
of concern for others and a lack of guilt or remorse when actions cause harm.110
Measures of psychopathy attempt to assess the motivation to comply with social 
norms; impulsivity; willingness to use deceit to obtain desired ends; and disre￾gard, that is, lack of empathic concern for others.
Research is not consistent about whether psychopathy is important to work 
behavior. One review found little correlation between measures of psychopathy 
and job performance or CWBs.111 Another found that antisocial personality, 
which is closely related to psychopathy, was positively related to advancement in 
the organization but unrelated to other aspects of career success and effective￾ness.112 Still other research suggests psychopathy is related to the use of hard 
influence tactics (threats, manipulation), bullying work behavior (physical or 
verbal threatening), and inappropriate interpersonal behavior during meetings 
and suggests that such employees do not feel remorseful for their actions.113
The cunning displayed by people who score high on psychopathy may thus help 
them gain power in an organization but keep them from using it toward healthy 
ends for themselves or their organizations.
narcissism The tendency to be arrogant, 
have a grandiose sense of self-importance, 
require excessive admiration, and possess a 
sense of entitlement.
psychopathy The tendency for a lack of 
concern for others and a lack of guilt or

Other Frameworks
The Dark Triad is a helpful framework for studying the three dominant dark-side 
traits in current personality research, and researchers are exploring other traits 
as well. For instance, the DiSC framework is a circumplex model (similar to the 
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 182 13/12/22 2:39 AMPersonality and Individual Differences CHAPTER 5 183
 An Ethical Choice 
 Do Certain Personality Traits Make You More 
Unethical? 
I
f one were to ask people if they are 
ethical, most would say yes. Indeed, 
evidence suggests that most people, 
universally and globally, believe in a “true 
self” that is morally “good” and “just.” 
Despite this ubiquitous belief, research 
reveals that, in many ways, people’s (un)
ethical behavior can be attributed to dif￾ferences in personality traits. 
 These personality traits can be 
more typical ones that come to mind, 
such as the facets of the Big Five. For 
instance, prior research has demon￾strated that people low on emotional 
stability, agreeableness, and consci￾entiousness are much more prone to 
engage in unethical behaviors, regard￾less of whether they are directed toward 
other individuals or the organization. 
Some may think of other frameworks 
as well, including the Dark Triad and 
honesty traits, which clearly have link￾ages to (un)ethical behavior. (People 
who tend to exhibit traits associated 
with dishonesty, Machiavellianism, nar￾cissism, and psychoticism are probably 
more likely to do unethical things.) 
 But beyond examining personal￾ity traits across contexts, people also 
have relatively stable aspects of them￾selves that lead to differences in (un)
ethical behavior. These individual differ￾ences comprise what researchers have 
described as “the moral self.” The 
concept of the moral self is not a new 
one—scholars and philosophers have 
been pondering this question for mil￾lennia. For instance, Aristotle proposed 
that the moral self is a holistic under￾standing of the self that is grounded 
in character and virtue. In many ways, 
character and virtue are related to the 
values that people espouse and put 
into practice, another individual differ￾ence discussed within this chapter on 
personality and individual differences. 
 Modern researchers view the moral 
self as the degree to which morality and 
ethicality are important to a person, 
comprise a central aspect of their iden￾tity, and motivate them to behave ethi￾cally. These ideas make logical sense—
if morality were important to someone, 
would they be more likely to think 
through ethical situations and behave 
in an ethical way? The answer is most 
likely yes. Another way in which people 
differ in the moral self is in moral emo￾tions (as discussed in the chapter on 
emotions and mood) . Some people are 
more prone to experiencing moral emo￾tions; emotions like anger, contempt, 
shame, and guilt can drive people to 
engage in (un)ethical behavior, whereas 
more callous, nonemotional responses 
may cause people to disregard the ethi￾cal aspects of situations. 
 Do certain personality traits make 
people more (un)ethical? In short, 
yes—certain personality traits can 
make people more prone to engaging 
in (un)ethical behaviors. But people do 
not exist in a vacuum—the strength of 
the situation and the surrounding con￾text matter to an incredible degree. 
Moreover, this does not mean that 
one’s personality forces one to behave 
in a given way—just that some people 
may need to work harder to counteract 
their tendencies than others. So what 
can one do to come to terms with one’s 
ethical dispositions and tendencies? 
Research suggests that self-awareness 
and self-monitoring are key. Those with 
confusing or conflicting moral stan￾dards, poor impulse control, and a lack 
of a drive to self-monitor may be more 
likely to experience ethical lapses. On 
the other hand, when people establish 
clear and viable standards, self￾monitoring skills, and a drive to change, 
they may be more likely to counteract 
their unethical impulses. 114 
affective circumplex ; see the chapter on emotions and mood ), 115 which suggests 
that personality characteristics can be represented on a circle with more similar 
traits in closer proximity, whereas more dissimilar traits are positioned farther 
apart. Similar to the MBTI, 116 people cluster into personality “types” based on 
their primary characteristic: 117 dominating (D), influencing (i), steadiness (S), 
and conscientiousness (C), although the framework recognizes that “people 
are not their types.” Despite the DiSC publishers’ claims of validity and reliabil￾ity evidence 118 and its mounting popularity as an alternative to the MBTI, few 
academic research studies have scientifically examined the validity of the DiSC 
personality framework. More research and evidence are needed on the DiSC. 
 One emerging framework incorporates an additional trait into the Big Five 
framework. The HEXACO model is composed of a new trait, honesty-humility 
(H), and emotionality (E; i.e., emotional stability), extroversion (X), agree￾ableness (A), conscientiousness (C), and openness to experience (O). 119 The 
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 183 13/12/22 2:39 AM184 PART 2 The Individual
addition of the H dimension came from cross-cultural studies that suggest 
that the English-centric early investigations that produced the Big Five essen￾tially “missed” a dimension that began to emerge with studies conducted in 
non-European cultures (e.g., Korean, Hungarian, etc.).120 The H dimension 
corresponds to people who are sincere, fair, modest, and humble. These indi￾viduals are not interested in social status, wealth, or money. Some research 
suggests that the addition of honesty-humility meaningfully adds to the Big 
Five, and the honesty-humility dimension has been found to predict ethically 
relevant outcomes, like abstaining from cheating (even in the presence of temp￾tations or prompts to cheat).121 This additional dimension has implications for 
OB, considering that dishonesty and cheating are extremely important for orga￾nizations (e.g., employees may cut corners, steal from the organization, etc.).122
Personality traits have both positive and negative aspects. The degree of each 
trait—those in the Big Five, the Dark Triad, and others—in a person and the 
combination of traits matter a great deal to organizational outcomes. It would 
be easy to make quick management decisions based on our observations, but it 
is important to keep discussions on personality in perspective and to consider 
other theories.
Other Personality Attributes Relevant to OB
As we have discussed, studies of traits have much to offer to the field of OB. 
Now we will look at other attributes that are powerful predictors of behavior in 
organizations: core self-evaluations, self-monitoring, and proactive personality.
Core Self-Evaluations (CSEs)
Core self-evaluations (CSEs) are bottom-line conclusions individuals have about 
their capabilities, competence, and worth as a person. People who have positive 
CSEs like themselves and see themselves as effective and in control of their envi￾ronment. Those with negative CSEs tend to dislike themselves, question their 
capabilities, and view themselves as powerless over their environment.123 As we 
discussed in the chapter on job attitudes, CSEs relate to job satisfaction because 
people who are positive on this trait see more challenge in their jobs and attain 
more complex jobs.
People with positive CSEs perform better than others because they set 
more ambitious goals, are more committed to their goals, and persist longer 
in attempting to reach them.124 People who have high CSEs provide better cus￾tomer service, are more popular coworkers, come up with creative solutions 
to problems, and may have careers that begin on a better footing and ascend 
more rapidly over time.125 However, high CSEs can have their downsides—for 
instance, coworkers and supervisors may view those with excessively high CSEs 
unfavorably, especially if the individual appears to abstain from helping others 
in the workplace.126
CSE also has implications for diversity and employee effectiveness in differ￾ent cultural contexts. Research also suggests that employees with positive CSEs 
tend to more effectively adapt to changes in their careers127 and to international 
environments when working in new cultures.128 As some examples, one study in 
a Chinese vehicle manufacturing plant found that CSEs were more positively 
related to job performance when individualism, rather than collectivism, was 
valued.129 Furthermore, although one’s language proficiency and nationality 
set employees in multinational teams apart as “different” from the rest of the 
group, their CSEs compensated for these differentiating factors, and they were 
able to become better leaders in their teams.130

Self-Monitoring
Riley is always in trouble at work. Although Riley is competent, hardworking, 
and productive, Riley receives average ratings in performance reviews and 
seems to have made a career out of irritating the supervisors. Riley’s problem 
is one of political ineptness and an inability to adjust to changing situations. As 
Riley says, “I’m true to myself. I don’t remake myself to please others.” Riley is a 
low self-monitor.
Self-monitoring describes an individual’s ability to adjust behavior to exter￾nal, situational factors.131 High self-monitors show considerable adaptability in 
adjusting their behavior to external situational factors. They are highly sensi￾tive to external cues and can behave differently in varying situations, sometimes 
presenting striking contradictions between their public personae and their pri￾vate selves.132 Low self-monitors like Riley cannot disguise themselves in that 
way. They tend to display their true dispositions and attitudes in every situation; 
hence, there is high consistency between who they are and what they do.
High self-monitor employees show less commitment to their organizations 
but receive better performance ratings and are more likely to emerge as lead￾ers.133 High self-monitor managers tend to be more mobile in their careers, 
receive more promotions (both internal and cross-organizational), and are more 
likely to occupy central positions in organizations.134 However, self-monitoring 
can be considered a mixed blessing; despite the aforementioned positive ben￾efits, self-monitors may be seen as inauthentic, self-serving, or unprincipled.135

circumstances or create new ones? These are proactive personalities.136 Those

 Myth or Science? We Can Accurately Judge Individuals’ 
Personalities a Few Seconds After Meeting Them 
 S
urprisingly, this statement appears 
to be true. 
 Research indicates that indi￾viduals can accurately appraise oth￾ers’ personalities only a few seconds 
after first meeting them or sometimes 
even from a photo. This “zero acquain￾tance” approach shows that, regard￾less of the way in which people first 
meet someone, whether in person or 
online, their first judgments about the 
other’s personality have some validity. 
In one study, for example, individuals 
were asked to introduce themselves in, 
on average, 7.4  seconds. Observers’ 
ratings of those individuals’ extrover￾sion were significantly correlated with 
the individuals’ self-reported extrover￾sion. Other research suggests person￾alities can be surmised from online 
profiles at zero acquaintance as well. 
One study even found that participants 
could determine the personality traits 
of individuals at the ends of the trait 
spectrum from viewing only photos. 
 Some traits, such as extroversion, 
are easier to perceive than others 
upon initial acquaintance, but less 
obvious traits like self-esteem are also 
often judged accurately by others. Even 
being forced to make intuitive, quick 
judgments rather than deliberate evalu￾ations does not seem to undermine 
the accuracy of the appraisals. 
 Situations make a difference in 
the accuracy of the judgments for 
some personality traits. For example, 
although emotional stability is perhaps 
the most difficult trait to detect accu￾rately, a recent study found emotional 
stability could be judged much more 
accurately when the situation made the 
individual react nervously. This makes 
sense when you consider that some 
situations activate or draw out a trait 
much more readily than others. Almost 
everybody looks calm when they are 
about to fall asleep! 
 The moderate accuracy of these 
“thin slices” (quick inferences from 
short experiences) helps explain 
the moderate validity of employment 
interviews , which we discuss in the 
human resources chapter . Specifically, 
research shows that interviewers make 
up their minds about candidates within 
two minutes of first meeting them. 
While this is hardly an ideal way to 
make important employment deci￾sions, the research on personality 
shows that these judgments do have 
some level of validity. It is important 
to keep in mind, however, that though 
we can ascertain people’s personali￾ties quickly, we should keep an open 
mind and suspend judgment. There is 
always more to people than what first 
meets the eye. 138
translates entrepreneurs’ visions into reality. 139 Proactive individuals have many 
desirable behaviors that organizations covet. They have higher levels of job per￾formance 140 and creativity 141 and do not need much oversight (and are given 
more autonomy as a result). 142 They tend to be satisfied with their jobs, com￾mitted to their organizations, and engaged in their work 143 and often achieve 
career success. 144
 A proactive personality may be important for work team members. Teams 
with high levels of proactive personality among members were more innova￾tive. 145 Proactive team leaders can quickly manage leadership transitions and can 
more readily build commitment among team members, leading to heightened 
team performance. 146 Proactive individuals are also more likely to exchange 
information with others in a team, which builds trust in teammate relation￾ships. 147 However, they are also more likely to be envied by their coworkers and 
teammates (and prone to social undermining or the withholding of help from 
others). 148
 In short, these personality traits predict many important organizational out￾comes. However, there has been a renewed interest in how personality interacts 
with the environment or how traits are affected by the situation or context. The 
next section will examine how the work environment, including contexts and 
situations, affects the expression of personality traits. 
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 186 13/12/22 2:39 AMPersonality and Individual Differences CHAPTER 5 187
Personality and Situations
Some personality traits can be effective in almost any environment or situation. 
For example, conscientiousness is helpful to the performance of most jobs, and 
extroversion is related to emergence as a leader in most situations. However, we 
are learning that the effect of traits on behavior may also depend on the situa￾tion. While advancements have been made in terms of mapping the personality 
domain, similar progress has been made in how people describe situations. One 
impressive study culled 146.7 billion words from several different sources that 
have been used to describe situations. Using AI, these researchers found that 
situations can be described as positive-negative, complex, typical, important, or 
humorous.149 Each of these characteristics can influence behavior or even the 
“activation” of personality traits.
Two theoretical frameworks, situation strength and trait activation, help 
describe how the context or situations can influence personality and behavior 
in the workplace.
Situation Strength Theory
Imagine you are in a meeting with your entire office. How likely are you to 
walk out, shout at a coworker, or turn your back on everyone? Probably highly 
unlikely. Now imagine you are working from home. You might work in your 
pajamas, listen to loud music, or shout at your cat walking across your keyboard. 
From these examples, you can see that many situations vary in their “strength.”
Situation strength theory proposes that the way personality translates into 
behavior depends on the strength of the situation. By situation strength, we mean 
the degree to which norms, cues, or standards dictate appropriate behavior.150
Strong situations show us what the right behavior is, pressure us to exhibit it, 
and discourage the wrong behavior. In weak situations, conversely, “anything 
goes,” and thus we are freer to express our personality in behavior. Thus, per￾sonality traits better predict behavior in weak situations than in strong ones.151
Components of Situation Strength Researchers have analyzed situation strength 
in organizations in terms of four elements:152
1. Clarity, or the degree to which cues about work duties and responsibilities 
are available and clear. Jobs high in clarity produce strong situations be￾cause individuals can readily determine what to do. For example, the job 
of janitor probably provides higher clarity about each task than that of a 
Hollywood actor’s agent.
2. Consistency, or the extent to which cues regarding work duties and respon￾sibilities are compatible with one another. Jobs with high consistency rep￾resent strong situations because all the cues point toward the same desired 
behavior. The job of acute care nurse, for example, probably has higher 
consistency than the job of manager.
3. Constraints, or the extent to which individuals’ freedom to decide or act is 
limited by forces outside their control. Jobs with many constraints represent 
strong situations because an individual has limited individual discretion. 
Bank examiner, for example, is probably a job with stronger constraints 
than forest ranger.
4. Consequences, or the degree to which decisions or actions have important im￾plications for the organization or its members, clients, suppliers, and so on. 
Jobs with important consequences represent strong situations because the 
environment is probably heavily structured to guard against mistakes. A sur￾geon’s job, for example, has higher consequences than a language teacher’s.

affects whether personality 
predicts behavior.

indicating that the way personality translates 
into behavior depends on the strength of the 
situation.
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 187 13/12/22 2:40 AM188 PART 2 The Individual
Organizational Situations Some researchers have speculated that organizations 
are strong situations because they impose rules, norms, and standards that gov￾ern behavior. These constraints are usually appropriate. For example, we would 
not want an employee to feel free to engage in sexual harassment, follow ques￾tionable accounting procedures, or clock into work only when the mood strikes.
Beyond the basics, though, it is not always desirable for organizations to create 
strong situations for their employees for several reasons. The elements of situa￾tion strength are often determined by organization rules and guidelines, which 
adds some objectivity to them. However, the perception of these rules influ￾ences how the person will respond to the situation’s strength.153 For instance, 
a construction supervisor who prioritizes safety will create a strong situation by 
establishing compelling norms for safety behavior. In turn, this situation may 
reduce accidents and injuries because it (1) promotes safety behaviors and (2) 
provides less of an opportunity for workers’ personality to influence their behav￾ior. In other words, employees with more careless or lackadaisical traits (e.g., 
low in conscientiousness) may be urged to comply with norms or risk being 
fired—so they follow the norms, perhaps begrudgingly. In general, their atti￾tudes and behavior are a function of the strength of the situation.154 Second, 
jobs with myriad rules and tightly controlled processes can be dull or demo￾tivating. Imagine that all work was executed with an assembly-line approach. 
Some people may prefer the routine, but many prefer having some variety and 
freedom. Third, strong situations might suppress the innovation prized by some 
organizations or that is needed to be successful in creative occupations.
Interestingly, when organizations tightly control processes that demotivate, 
suppress innovation, or block employees’ preferred way of doing things, some￾times other personality traits will shine through even though the situation is 
strong.155 As an example, say your supervisor establishes a policy to stop you and 
your coworkers from accomplishing a task using a very easy method. Now, your 
job has become harder and limited the extent to which your conscientiousness 
can “shine through.” In response, another trait might come through despite the 
situations’ strength. For example, now your disagreeableness might lead you to 
engage in CWBs, like purposefully ignoring the policy or shirking your responsi￾bilities because you are angry about the policy change and the strong situation.
In sum, managers need to recognize the role of situation strength in the 
workplace and find the appropriate balance.
Trait Activation Theory
Another important theoretical framework toward understanding personality 
and situations is trait activation theory (TAT). TAT predicts that some situations, 
events, or interventions “activate” a trait more than others. Using TAT, we can 
foresee which jobs suit certain personalities. For example, a commission-based 
compensation plan would likely activate extroversion because extroverted peo￾ple are more reward-sensitive, than, say, open people. Conversely, in jobs that 
encourage creativity, differences in openness may better predict desired behav￾ior than differences in extroversion. See Exhibit 5-4 for specific examples.
TAT also applies to personality tendencies. For example, people learning 
online respond differently when their behavior is being electronically moni￾tored. Those who had a high fear of failure had higher apprehension from the 
monitoring than others and learned significantly less. In this case, a feature of 
the environment (electronic monitoring) activated a trait (fear of failing), and 
the combination of the two meant lowered job performance.156 TAT can also 
work in a positive way. One study found that when your coworkers are support￾ive, conscientious personality traits are activated so that you have a stronger 
sense of duty toward your fellow coworkers and, in turn, are more likely to share 
information with them when conflicted about whether to do so.157
trait activation theory (TAT) A theory that 
predicts that some situations, events, or 
interventions “activate” a trait more than 
others.

Together, situation strength and trait activation theories show that the clas￾sic debate over nature versus nurture might best be framed as nature and nur￾ture. Not only does each affect behavior, but they interact with one another. 
Put another way, personality and the situation both affect work behavior, but 
when the situation is right, the power of personality to predict behavior is even 
higher.158 In the next sections, we move beyond a discussion of personality 
toward two other important individual differences for OB: ability and values.
Ability
Regardless of how motivated you are, you may not be able to act as well as 
Denzel Washington, vault as well as Simone Biles, or write as well as Amanda 
Gorman. Of course, all of us have strengths and weaknesses that make us rel￾atively superior or inferior to others in performing certain tasks or activities. 
From management’s standpoint, the challenge is to understand the differences 
and thus increase the likelihood that a given employee will perform the job 
well. Applicants and employees, then, should market their abilities and develop 
skills to be successful in the jobs they want.
What does ability mean? As we use the term, ability is an individual’s current 
capacity to perform the various tasks in a job. Overall abilities are essentially 
made up of two sets of factors: intellectual and physical.
Intellectual Abilities
Intellectual abilities are abilities needed to perform mental activities—thinking, 
reasoning, and problem solving. Most societies place a high value on intelli￾gence, and for good reason. Smart people are generally better performers, earn 
more money, are promoted more often, and attain higher-level jobs.159 Jobs 
differ in the demands they place on intellectual abilities. Research consistently 
indicates a correspondence between ability and job performance, especially for 
complex jobs and tasks. Where employee tasks are highly routine and there are 
few or no opportunities to exercise discretion, a high intelligence quotient (IQ)

of intellectual and physical 
abilities to OB.

is not as important to performing well.160 While intelligence (especially when 
combined with motivation, discussed later in the text)161 is a huge benefit to 
performing a job well, it does not make people happier or more satisfied with 
their jobs.162 In fact, research suggests that those with higher cognitive ability 
and who are high performers in the workplace might be victimized, bullied, and 
mistreated by their peers due to envy and social comparison.163
Assessing and measuring intellectual ability are not always simple, partially 
because people are not consistently capable of correctly assessing their own 
intellectual abilities.164 IQ tests are designed to ascertain a person’s general 
intellectual abilities, but the origins, influence factors, and testing of (IQ) are 
controversial.165 So, too, are popular college admission tests, such as the SAT 
and ACT, and graduate admission tests in business (GMAT), law (LSAT), and 
medicine (MCAT). The firms that produce these tests do not claim that they 
assess intelligence, but experts confirm that they do.166 Many organizations use 
intelligence tests in hiring decisions; for example, if you want to be a profes￾sional football player in the NFL, you will have to take an intellectual abilities 
test!167
Dimensions of Intellectual Ability The seven most frequently cited dimensions 
making up intellectual ability are number aptitude, verbal comprehension, per￾ceptual speed, inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, spatial visualization, 
and memory.168 Exhibit 5-5 describes these dimensions. These dimensions are 
positively correlated, so if you score high on verbal comprehension, for exam￾ple, you are also more likely to score high on spatial visualization. The correla￾tions are high enough that researchers also recognize that intelligence takes on 
an overall, global form as general mental ability (GMA).
169
Evidence supports the idea that the structures and measures of intellectual 
abilities generalize across cultures: GMA was found in 73.2  percent of coun￾tries in one study of more than 50,000 individuals.170 Someone in Venezuela 
or Sudan, for instance, does not have a different set of mental abilities than an 
American or Czech individual. There is some evidence that IQ scores vary to 
general mental ability (GMA) An overall 
factor of intelligence, as suggested by 
the positive correlations among specific 
intellectual ability dimensions.

some degree across cultures, but this gap is decreasing year by year, and those 
differences become much smaller when we consider educational and economic 
differences.171
The Wonderlic Ability Test It might surprise you that the intelligence test most 
widely used in hiring decisions, the Wonderlic Ability Test, takes only twelve 
minutes to complete. There are different forms of the test, but each has fifty 
questions and the same general construct. Here are two questions to try:
• When rope is selling at $0.10 a foot, how many feet can you buy for $0.60?
• Assume the first two statements below are true. Is the final one true, false, 
or not certain?
a. The boy plays baseball.
b. All baseball players wear hats.
c. The boy wears a hat.
The Wonderlic measures both speed (almost nobody has time to answer 
every question) and power (the questions get harder as you go along), so the 
average score is quite low—about twenty-one out of fifty. Because the Wonderlic 
can provide valid information cheaply, many organizations use it in hiring deci￾sions, including Aveda, Duracell, Subway, and U-Haul.172 Most of these compa￾nies do not give up other hiring tools, such as application forms or interviews. 
Rather, they add the Wonderlic for its ability to provide valid data on applicants’ 
intelligence levels.
Regardless of the test used, evidence suggests that using intellectual abilities 
tests in hiring or other HR practices may lead to disparate impact in organi￾zations (see the chapter on diversity).
173 Managers should exercise caution in 
implementing intellectual ability tests for HR purposes (e.g., hiring) and should 
actively monitor whether the test is excluding members from underrepresented 
groups or protected classes.
Physical Abilities
Though the changing nature of work suggests that intellectual abilities are 
increasingly important for many jobs, physical abilities have been and will 
remain valuable. Research on hundreds of jobs has identified nine basic abilities 
needed in the performance of physical tasks.174 These are described in Exhibit 
5-6. High employee performance is likely to be achieved when the extent to 
which a job requires each of the nine abilities matches the abilities of employees 
in that job.175 For example, certain occupations might require more strength 
than others (e.g., firefighting); as such, measures of physical ability predict 
long-term firefighter performance in these occupations.176 Problems with dis￾crimination can occur, however, when using physical abilities tests, as men tend 
to score substantially better than women on these tests. To some degree, one 
can improve the extent to which women meet minimum qualifications through 
physical fitness training.177 If a job you are seeking employment in requires 
strength, flexibility, or other physical requirements, it might be best to train to 
ensure you are sufficiently prepared.
In sum, ability-related individual differences are important in a number 
of types of jobs and occupations (e.g., jobs that require complex tasks or 
physical prowess). At the same time, organizations are increasingly aware 
that an optimally productive workforce includes all types of people and 
does not automatically exclude anyone based on broad categories of abili￾ties. Managers should be careful using ability measures for HR purposes 
unless the ability measured is absolutely required for the job. Of course, 
physical abilities The capacity to do tasks 
that demand stamina, dexterity, strength, and 
similar characteristics.
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 191 13/12/22 2:40 AM192 PART 2 The Individual
simultaneously aspiring toward diversity yet realizing the predictive ben￾efits of individual differences assessments takes skill and should be a part 
of any organization’s diversity management strategies (see the chapter on 
diversity).
Having discussed abilities as an individual difference, we now turn to values. 
Values are often very specific and describe belief systems rather than behav￾ioral tendencies. Some beliefs or values reflect a person’s cultural background 
(see the chapter on diversity for an in-depth explanation), whereas other val￾ues reflect personality. However, as we will learn in the next section, we do not 
always act consistently with our values.
Values
At the heart of all organizations lie a set of values that are central to their mis￾sion. Wells Fargo, for instance, values “what’s right for customers” and states 
that it places “customers at the center of everything we do. We want to exceed 
customer expectations and build relationships that last a lifetime.”178 However, 
sometimes the values or behaviors of the people who make up organizations do 
not match the values they espouse. For example, employees of Wells Fargo, the 
same organization that values “what’s right for customers,” opened millions of 
fake accounts, moved money into these accounts, and signed customers up for 
online banking without their consent to meet sales goals—opening the com￾pany up to legal troubles.179
Values represent relatively stable and enduring,180 basic convictions that 
some actions and outcomes are more morally, socially, or personally prefer￾able than others.181 Values contain a judgmental element because they carry 
an individual’s ideas about what is right, good, or desirable. They have both 
content and intensity attributes. The content attribute says a mode of con￾duct or end-state of existence is important. The intensity attribute specifies how 
important it is. When a person ranks their values in terms of intensity, we get 
an idea of that person’s value system. We all have a hierarchy of values accord￾ing to the relative importance we assign to values such as freedom, pleasure, 
self-respect, honesty, obedience, and equality. Values lay the foundation for 
understanding attitudes and motivation, and they influence our perceptions. 
We enter an organization with preconceived notions of what “ought” and 
“ought not” to be. These notions contain our interpretations of right and

wrong and our preferences for certain behaviors or outcomes. Regardless of 
whether they clarify or bias our judgment, our values influence our attitudes 
and behaviors at work.
Many of the values we hold are established in our early years—by par￾ents, teachers, friends, and others.182 If we question our values, they may 
change, but more often they are reinforced. There is also evidence link￾ing personality to values, implying our values may be partly determined by 
our personality traits.183 Open people, for example, value pursuing new 
ideas (e.g., trying a new sales strategy rather than exercising restraint), 
while agreeable people may place a greater value on caring for others and 
cooperating (e.g., being attracted to a collaborative rather than competitive 
work environment).184
While values can sometimes augment decision making, at times they can 
cloud objectivity and rationality.185 Suppose you enter an organization with 
the view that allocating pay based on performance is right while allocating pay 
based on seniority is wrong. How will you react if you find the organization you 
have just joined rewards seniority and not performance? You are likely to be 
disappointed—this can lead to job dissatisfaction and a decision not to exert a 
high level of effort because “It’s probably not going to lead to more money any￾way.” Would your attitudes and behavior be different if your values aligned with 
the organization’s pay policies? Most likely.
Terminal Versus Instrumental Values
How can we organize values? One researcher—Milton Rokeach—argued that 
we can separate them into two categories.186 One set, called terminal values, 
refers to desirable end-states. These are the goals a person would like to achieve 
during a lifetime. The other set, called instrumental values, refers to preferable 
modes of behavior, or means of achieving the terminal values. Some examples of 
terminal values are prosperity and economic success, freedom, health and well￾being, world peace, and meaning in life. Examples of instrumental values are 
autonomy and self-reliance, personal discipline, kindness, and goal-orientation. 
Each of us places value on both the ends (terminal values) and the means 
(instrumental values).
Building upon Rokeach’s value theory, Shalom Schwartz organized 
Rokeach’s values into ten dimensions: achievement, hedonism, stimulation, 
self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, security, and 
power.187 Schwartz provided evidence across twenty separate countries for 
this framework of values.188 Perhaps it is easy to see how some of these values 
are directly relevant to people in organizations, with some (e.g., universalism, 
benevolence, etc.) promoting effectiveness and treating others well, while oth￾ers can cling to what is typically done (e.g., tradition, conformity, and security) 
or value self-enhancement (e.g., power and achievement). Perhaps Wells Fargo, 
although valuing benevolence toward customers, was composed of employees 
who personally valued self-enhancement.
Generational Values
Researchers have integrated several analyses of work values into groups that 
attempt to capture the shared views of different cohorts or generations in the 
U.S. workforce.189 You will surely be familiar with the labels—for example, baby 
boomers, Gen Xers, millennials, Gen Zers—some of which are used interna￾tionally. Exhibit 5-7 segments employees by the era during which they entered 
the workforce.190
terminal values Desirable end-states of 
existence; the goals a person would like to 
achieve during their lifetime.
instrumental values Preferable modes 
of behavior or means of achieving one’s 
terminal values.
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 193 13/12/22 2:40 AM194 PART 2 The Individual
Though it is fascinating to think about generational values, remember that 
these classifications lack solid research support. Early research was plagued by 
methodological problems that made it difficult to assess whether differences 
exist. Reviews suggest many of the generalizations are either overblown or 
incorrect.191 Differences across generations often do not support popular con￾ceptions of how generations differ. For example, the value placed on leisure 
has increased over generations from the baby boomers to the millennials, and 
work centrality has declined, but research did not find that millennials had 
more altruistic work values.192 Also, research has failed to support that baby 
boomers have a higher work ethic than other generations.193 Another modern 
criticism of millennials is that they are entitled and remnants of the “participa￾tion trophy” generation;194 however, one study of more than ten thousand peo￾ple suggests that there are no differences between generations in entitlement. 
Furthermore, generational research criticisms aside, this study suggested that 
baby boomers are the ones who tend to become more entitled as they age!195
Another study tried to uncover whether major events (e.g., the Social Reform 
era in China) influenced the values of later generations.196 If generational dif￾ferences are real, one would expect major, value-defining events to lead to 
changes in generational values over time for the affected generation. In this 
study, generational values were largely similar before, during, and after China’s 
Social Reform. Interestingly, all generations experienced increasing openness 
to change as a result of the Reform.197 As such, perhaps major events do not 
affect specific generations, as many claim (e.g., the Vietnam War’s influence 
on boomers, the dot-com boom on Gen Xers, the Great Recession on millenni￾als). Instead, maybe these events affect all people who were alive at the time in 
similar ways.
Despite the lack of support for the validity of generational values, support has 
been provided for differences in how people perceive those of other generations—
in the workplace, people place others into generational categories and apply 
stereotypes that affect workplace decisions.198 Although there is little validity to 
generational differences, nevertheless, these differences are still perpetuated as 
stereotypes that are often applied in the workplace, which can result in ageist or 
discriminatory climates (see the chapter on diversity) if left unchecked.199

Summary
Personality and individual differences matter to organizational behavior. They 
are critically important because the fit between people and their jobs, organi￾zations, supervisors, and groups affects employee job attitudes, performance, 
and intentions to quit. In this chapter, we discussed personality and two indi￾vidual differences highly relevant to OB (e.g., abilities and values). The Big Five 
has been a significant advancement, though the Dark Triad and other traits 
(i.e., proactive personality) matter as well. Emerging theory and research re￾veal how personality matters more in some situations than others. Every trait 
and individual difference has advantages and disadvantages for work attitudes 
and behavior. There is no perfect constellation of characteristics that is ideal in 
every situation. Personality and individual differences can help you understand 
why people (including yourself!) act, think, and feel the way they do. Astute 
managers and employees can put that understanding to use by placing them￾selves (and assisting others in placing themselves) in situations that best fit their 
personalities.
Implications for Managers
● Evaluate jobs, workgroups, and your organization to determine the opti￾mal value, interest, and personality fit with employees.
● Consider screening job candidates for the personality traits that are most 
relevant to your organization’s values (e.g., conscientiousness, extrover￾sion) and the requirements most important for success in the job.
● Although many personality frameworks exist, there are striking differ￾ences in evidence and empirical support across measures. Based on these 
findings, managers should critically evaluate personality frameworks and 
the instruments used to measure them before making substantive deci￾sions based on their results. We recommend the Big Five as this is the 
most widely supported personality framework to date.
● Although some personality traits are more suitable for predicting job per￾formance while on the job, other personality traits can predict how well 
employees do in training and onboarding. Employees with certain traits 
may do better with additional support and guidance to prevent early turn￾over and contribute to their career development.
● Consider situational factors when evaluating observable personality traits. 
Policies, practices, and even events can make situations strong or weak or 
elicit the display of (un)desired personality traits. Attempt to modify the 
situation to encourage or dissuade certain behaviors, but recognize that 
this can sometimes have unintended effects.
● Although abilities are often the best predictors of job performance out￾side of proving that one can directly do the job, they tend to be wrought 
with disparate impact concerns. Exercise caution in assessing applicants 
and candidates for ability unless intellectual or physical abilities are neces￾sary and required for the job.
● Resist the temptation to group coworkers and employees into genera￾tional categories—the evidence suggests that these differences are not 
very compelling. Furthermore, these generational categories can lead to 
harmful stereotyping and potentially to disparate impact or treatment to￾ward employees from protected age classes.

 Millennials Are More Narcissistic Than Other Generations 
POINT 
Millennials have some great virtues: As a group, they are tech￾nologically savvy, socially tolerant, and engaged. They value 
their quality of life as equal to their career, seeking a bal￾ance between home and work. In these ways, millennials surpass 
baby boomers, who are less technologically adept, less tolerant, and 
who have a history of striving to get ahead at all costs. However, mil￾lennials have a big Achilles’ heel—they are more narcissistic. 
 Several large-scale, longitudinal studies found that millennials are 
more likely than baby boomers to have seemingly inflated views of 
themselves, and psychologists have found that narcissism has been 
growing since the early 1980s. More millennials rate themselves as 
above average on attributes such as academic ability, leadership, 
public speaking ability, and writing ability. Millennials are also more 
likely to agree they would be “very good” spouses (56 percent, com￾pared to 37 percent among 1980 graduates), parents (54 percent; 
36 percent for 1980 graduates), and workers (65 percent; 49 percent 
for 1980 graduates). 
 Cliff Zukin, a senior faculty fellow at Rutgers University, believes the 
reason is in the childhood upbringing of millennials. “This is the most 
affirmed generation in history,” Zukin said. “They were raised believing 
they could do anything they wanted to, and that they have skills and 
talents to bring to a job setting.” Jean M. Twenge, author of Generation 
Me , agrees. “People were not saying, ‘Believe in yourself’ and ‘You are 
special’ in the ’60s.” 
 Narcissism is bad for society and particularly bad for the work￾place. “[Narcissists] tend to be very self-absorbed; they value fun 
in their personal and their work life,” one administrator said. “I can’t 
expect them to work on one project for any amount of time without 
getting bored.” 
COUNTERPOINT 
 Wasn’t “the Me Generation” generations ago? Honestly, every 
generation thinks they are better than the ones that come 
after! “You can find complaints [about the younger gen￾eration] in Greek literature, in the Bible,” Professor Cappelli of the 
Wharton School observed. “There’s no evidence Millennials are differ￾ent. They’re just younger.” What is universally true is that young people 
share certain characteristics . . . because they are young. 
 A recent study shows the similarity between how millennials and 
baby boomers thought about themselves at the same stage of life. As 
college freshmen, 71 percent of millennials thought they were above 
average academically, and 63 percent of baby boomers thought the 
same thing when they were college freshmen. Similarly, 77 percent of 
millennials believed they were above average in the drive to achieve, 
versus 68 percent for baby boomers. In other words, “Every generation 
is Generation Me.” 
 In some ways, millennials may be less narcissistic than baby 
boomers today. As one manager observed, “[Millennials] don’t have 
that line between work and home that used to exist, so they’re doing 
Facebook for the company at night, on Saturday or Sunday. We get 
incredible productivity out of them.” Millennials also may be more 
altruistic. For example, 29 percent of millennials believe individuals 
have a responsibility to remain involved in issues and causes for the 
good of all, while only 24 percent of baby boomers feel the same level 
of responsibility. 
 Rather than comparing different generations, it is more accurate 
to compare people at one life stage with others at the same life stage. 
Research supports that younger people do tend to be more narcissis￾tic than those in later life stages. Millennials are no more narcissistic 
than baby boomers were in their youth. 200

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
An insight into your individual differences and an un￾derstanding of how these are important in the workplace 
can help you improve your employability skills. First, the 
workplace is a complex system filled with many interact￾ing people. By understanding how people have different 
personalities, abilities, and values, you will be better able to 
anticipate conflict and avoid personality or value clashes. 
Many organizations measure and assess personality. There￾fore, understanding your own personality can help your ca￾reer. You can discover your personality strengths, use your 
personality insights to become more employable, and know 
what to focus on during your job search. Conversely, un￾derstanding how the situation either constrains or activates 
these behavioral traits or tendencies is also essential for be￾coming more adaptable in the workplace. This knowledge 
can help you make better decisions in deciding which com￾panies you would like to work for and understanding how 
you fit with the culture in these organizations.
In this chapter, you developed your critical thinking 
and self-management skills by finding out how personali￾ties can be accurately judged within seconds after meeting 
someone, gaining insight into personality traits that can 
predict unethical behavior, and debating whether millen￾nials are more narcissistic than other generations. In the 
next section, you will develop your communication and 
leadership skills by exploring self-management processes 
in job interviews, questioning the ethics of working for 
organizations where you think you may not be the best 
fit, and critically evaluating the use of a personality assess￾ment in a large technology company.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Acing the Interview

together with your partner, answer the debrief questions.
Interviewer Role Description: Your task is to conduct a 
brief ten-minute interview. You are seeking a new team 
member as the hiring manager at a supermarket chain. 
The team member’s primary job duties include working 
the sales floor, answering questions about services and 
merchandise, stocking shelves, and organizing displays. 
You are seeking a proactive and conscientious employ￾ee who values hard work. The ideal candidate would 
be friendly, motivated, someone with customer service 
experience, and an individual who is passionate about 
natural foods and healthy living. Now prepare five ques￾tions that you will ask the job candidate to determine if 
their personality and values would fit both the position 
and the organization.
Job Candidate Role Description 1: You are interviewing

ETHICAL DILEMMA How Long Should You Wait Before Deciding If a Job Is Not 
a Good Fit?
You have been looking for a job for a month and are 
not much closer to finding your dream job. However, 
you recently interviewed with a company, and after 
going through several rounds of interviews, the com￾pany informed you that it is between you and another 
candidate. You will be informed of their decision in a 
few days. Truthfully, you are not particularly interested 
in the position. Still, you have not received any other 
job offers, so you decide to wait to see if you are offered 
the position.
After a few days have passed, you are eventually offered 
the position. But you are still questioning if you should 
accept the offer. You were hoping for a higher-level posi￾tion with a higher salary. Although you would be finan￾cially able to support yourself without a job for a few more 
months, you worry that not having a job may hurt your 
chances of securing your ideal job. Ultimately you decide 
to accept the position despite your reservations.
Although you are relieved when you accept the posi￾tion, as you begin the orientation and training process, 
you soon realize that this job carries more responsibility 
than you anticipated. You hoped that it would be a job 
where you could get by doing a minimal amount of work, 
and in the meantime, you could apply for other jobs. 
Perhaps you should not have taken the job so that you 
could have devoted more time and energy to finding a job 
that was a good fit. However, you are learning skills that 
will likely be useful in the future and help you advance 
within your field.
Questions
5-12. Are there ethical implications for accepting a 
job that you are not serious about committing to 
long-term?
5-13. Before accepting the position, are you obligated 
to let the employer know your true intentions? 
Why or why not?
5-14. Are there any circumstances under which it would 
be acceptable to take a position even if you can￾not commit to staying in the position long-term?
5-15. Should you wait before deciding if the job is not 
a good fit for you once on the job? Why or why 
not? What are the ethical implications for decid￾ing later rather than earlier?
CASE INCIDENT Sky Energy
Sky Energy (often referred to as just “Sky”) is a large 
technology company with 45,000 employees located in 
San Jose, California. The company focuses on developing 
clean energy, primarily manufacturing electric vehicles 
as well as solar and wind technology. Sky was founded in 
2003 by two engineers, one of whom is the current CEO, 
Eduardo Malaga. Malaga is known for his innovative 
thinking and is continually seeking to develop new prod￾ucts that promote clean energy.
Malaga’s entrepreneurial spirit has a strong influence 
not only on the products that the company develops but 
also on the organizational structure of Sky Energy. Malaga 
has a vision for creating more of a team structure with less 
hierarchy and more collaboration on projects. As Malaga 
considers strategies for developing effective teams, he 
thinks about the potential obstacles that employees may 
face as they are frequently required to work closely with 
others. From personal experience, he knows that man￾aging and working with different personalities can be 
challenging. One day he remembers a nifty personality 
test, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), that he 
took earlier in his career. Malaga found learning about his 
“type” really enjoyable and useful in understanding how 
he interacted with others at work. His belief that he has 
stumbled on the perfect tool to facilitate the team struc￾ture is further reinforced as he does some more research 
on the MBTI. For instance, the company that sells the 
MBTI suggests that the assessment is valid and reliable 
based on data it has collected. Furthermore, Malaga is 
confident that it would not create division in the work 
teams even though the assessment would classify each 
team member as belonging to a certain type. As the MBTI 
website says, “All types are equal.”
Although Sky Energy is by most standards remarkably 
successful, Malaga knows that the companies that sustain 
long-term success are those that continue to innovate. He 
remembers how Facebook overtook Myspace, and that 
is just one of many examples. After doing his research, 
Malaga is ready to hit the ground running using the 
MBTI at Sky. He plans to administer the MBTI to all cur￾rent employees and have project managers use the data 
to create project teams. Malaga also plans to use it as a 
pre-employment assessment. Sky is focused on selecting 
individuals who can be developed and will stay with the 
company long-term. As such, Malaga believes it is more 
important to find “coachable” people who fit with the 
M05_ROBB0025_19_GE_C05.indd 198 13/12/22 2:40 AMPersonality and Individual Differences CHAPTER 5 199
company’s values and philosophy rather than those with 
specific qualifications or experience. Soon hiring manag￾ers and recruiters are trained in administering and evalu￾ating the MBTI.
For example, as the hiring team is deciding between 
two final candidates (Carson and Zara) for a software en￾gineer position, they are faced with a difficult decision as 
to which candidate to hire. While Zara has less experience 
than Carson, during the interview, Zara was more enthu￾siastic about the company’s mission. She emphatically 
highlighted how a previous internship at an organization 
dedicated to environmental activism would make her 
a great candidate for the position. Furthermore, Zara’s 
MBTI type was an ENTJ (Extroversion + Intuition 
+ Thinking + Judging), while Carson was an ISFJ 
(Introversion + Sensing + Feeling + Judging). From 
Carson’s interview, it was clear that he was reliable, hard￾working, and practical, as his type indicated. Although 
the hiring staff believed these traits would be beneficial, 
they noted that a slight majority of the current employ￾ees’ types included introversion. Not only was Zara an 
extrovert, but her type also indicated that she was vision￾focused and would assume leadership without hesitation. 
Carson (as an ISFJ) would most likely lack the leadership 
qualities Sky was looking for in its new hires. In the end, 
the hiring staff decided that Zara would bring diversity to 
the teams she would be working on. Given her prior ex￾perience and MBTI type, she would be a better match to 
carry out the company’s vision.
Malaga also noted how the MBTI could strengthen 
teams by ensuring they were diverse in their MBTI types. 
One of the hiring managers noted that the Big Five 
Model could be used instead because it also measures 
extroversion and introversion. While a few of the manag￾ers agreed, the team ultimately decided to stick with the 
MBTI as the tool’s use was clearly part of Malaga’s vision 
for the company.
Questions
5-16. After reading the case, what are your thoughts 
on the MBTI? Why do you think management at 
Sky responded so favorably to the MBTI? Do you 
think they would respond differently or change 
their ways if they knew the lack of empirical evi￾dence for the MBTI? Why or why not?
5-17. Is there another personality framework that 
would have been more effective in achieving 
Malaga’s goals? If so, why do you think this frame￾work would have been more effective? If you were 
a hiring manager on the team at Sky, what would 
you suggest to the rest of your team, and how 
would you convince them to go with your idea?
5-18. Evaluate the hiring staff’s decision-making pro￾cess for hiring a new software engineer. To what 
extent should the individual’s personality traits 
factor into the decision-making process? How 
should the organization use the personality data 
to make decisions?

 INDIVIDUAL INTUITION IGNITING INNOVATION 
Richard Branson, Sir James Dyson, and Ella Woodward are three entre￾preneurs and very successful business owners operating in comple tely 
different industries, but they have one thing in common—a strong, innovative, 
entrepreneurial intuition. Richard Branson, the English business tycoon, 
investor, and philanthropist; Sir James Dyson, the British inventor, industrial 
designer, and founder of the Dual Cyclone bagless vacuum cleaner; and 
Ella Woodward, the English food writer and founder of the brand Deliciously 
Ella, have all made key business decisions based on their intuition and 
“gut feeling,” leading to innovative, creative market offerings that ultimately 
resulted in successful business ventures and strong brand names within 
the United Kingdom as well as the global marketplace. Richard Branson has 
admitted to making decisions based on creative instinct, James Dyson has 
confessed to trusting intuition based on market research, and Ella Woodward 
has drawn on her emotions and drive in response to a diagnosis of postural 
tachycardia syndrome to make decisions. 
 Of course, their business ventures’ successes have not been the outcome 
solely of the entrepreneurs’ intuitive decision-making; sound analytical skills 
and well-informed judgment have played a major role as well. Dyson’s decision￾making has been based on his knowledge of and expertise in the technology, 
Branson’s is based on his knowledge of the market, and Woodward’s is based 
on her knowledge of the targeted consumer. Decision making is a complex 
task and process, particularly in a corporate environment, as it requires and 
engages both intuition (and therefore affective reasoning) as well as rationalized

judgments. The two aspects work in a symbiotic manner, but differently from 
one individual to another.
Intuition has often been on their side, but not always. Consider, for 
example, the case of Virgin Cola. In 1994, Virgin Group founder Richard 
Branson was looking to broaden Virgin’s offerings and to bring a rival to 
Coca-Cola and Pepsi brands. After numerous ups and (mainly) downs, Virgin 
Drinks U.S.A., the company dealing with Virgin Cola’s U.S. market, closed 
in April 2001, having managed to establish a measly 0.5 percent share of 
the market by volume. In 2012, the production of Virgin Cola was ceased 
entirely, and no company acquired the UK Virgin Cola licence in its place.
The hope was to take over Coca-Cola and Pepsi’s market shares and 
even dominate the soft drinks market, but the actual facts revealed a failure 
in the product, which some attribute to a lack of market research and market 
knowledge and even misinterpretation of consumer behavior. Others argue 
that this could have been a result of what is known as bounded rationality, 
which involves oversimplifying a decision that was complex at that time. 
Still others state that it was simply a case of bad judgment in the first 
place. Wherever the truth lies, Branson is not deterred from taking risks or 
venturing into the unknown; he continues to be intrigued and inspirited by 
them. And these traits have made him the business magnate he is.1
As we will see later in the chapter, the appropriateness, ethicality, and 
creativity inherent in decision making have a number of implications in the 
workplace. However, our decision making is only as good as our perceptions, and 
unfortunately, these can be wrought with error and bias. To better understand 
what influences us and our organizations, we start at the roots of our thought 
processes: our perceptions and the way they affect our decision making.
What Is Perception?
Things are not always as they seem, and unfortunately our perceptions can lead 
to bias. Particularly nefarious is when we perceive another person as belonging 
to a certain stereotyped group; this can affect how we interact with them. We 
form our strongest impressions based on what we perceive about other people, 
including their moral character, but our initial information about this can be 
sketchy and unfounded.2
 For instance, weight bias and discrimination affect 
everyone in the office in hurtful ways by activating stereotypes reflecting lazi￾ness, meekness, or poor health.3 Perception is a process by which we organize 
and interpret sensory impressions to give meaning to our environment. What 
we perceive can be substantially different from objective reality.
Why is perception important in the study of organizational behavior (OB)? 
People’s behavior and decisions are based on their perception of what reality is, 
not on reality itself. In other words, our perception becomes the reality from which 
we act. For instance, a Brazilian employee interacting with a Japanese employee in 
a virtual meeting may perceive the silence in the conversation as awkward or some￾thing negative—when silence is important and conveys good listening in some 
Asian cultures.4
 To understand what all of us have in common in our interpreta￾tions of reality, we need to begin with the factors that influence our perceptions.

Factors That Influence Perception
Many factors shape and sometimes distort perception. These factors can reside 
in the perceiver, the object or target being perceived, or the situation in which the 
perception is made (see Exhibit 6-1).
Perceiver When you look at a target, your interpretation of what you see is influ￾enced by your personal characteristics—attitudes, personality, motives, interests, 
past experiences, and expectations.5
 Indeed, people do not always see the same 
target in exactly the same way. Sometimes, the difference is as stark as one person 
saying a dress is blue and black and another saying that it is white and gold, like 
the viral image that circulated the Internet in 2015.6
 In some ways, we hear what 
we want to hear and we see what we want to see—not because it is the truth but 
because it conforms to our thinking.7
 For instance, research indicates that super￾visors perceived employees who started work earlier in the day as more conscien￾tious and therefore as higher performers; however, supervisors who were night 
owls themselves were less likely to make that erroneous assumption.8
Some perceptions created by attitudes like these can be counteracted by objec￾tive evaluations, but others can be more insidious. For instance, a perceiver’s power 
or status influences whether they stick up for a victim of incivility in the workplace 
by directly confronting the perpetrator. On the other hand, if the perceiver is in a 
lower-status position in the organization, they are more likely to avoid the perpe￾trator and only step in to offer social support to the victim.9
 As another example, 
leaders commonly talk or write about their leadership experiences so often that 
it becomes difficult for them to disentangle what really happened to them from 
what they recall to be true.10 This may cause leaders to rely on incorrect beliefs 
or actions because it fits with what they believe worked well for them. As William 
Maxwell once wrote, “In talking about the past, we lie with every breath we draw.”11
Target The characteristics of the target also affect what we perceive. Because 
we do not look at targets in isolation, the relationship of a target to its back￾ground influences perception, as does our tendency to group close things and 
similar things together. We can also perceive members of any group that has 
clearly distinguishable characteristics as alike in other, often unrelated ways, 
leading to the formation of implicit stereotypes (see the chapter on diversity in 
organizations). These assumptions can be harmful, as when people who have 
criminal records are prejudged in the workplace even when the perceiver knows 
that they were wrongly arrested.12
Sometimes this can work in the target’s favor, in ways that can affect organiza￾tions’ bottom lines. For example, in more than ten thousand microloan transac￾tions, the more pleasant the appearance of the customer (i.e., loan requester),

the more likely the loan was to be approved, and the quicker the approval 
occurred.13 Using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, these researchers 
applied machine learning techniques and were able to determine that pleas￾ant appearance could predict loan approval with about 60 percent accuracy.14
As another example, budding entrepreneurs benefit from the extent to which 
crowdfunders perceive them as passionate people. In one series of experiments, 
crowdfunders (e.g., using Kickstarter and Indiegogo) were more likely to admire 
and fund entrepreneurs they perceived to be passionate.15 Conversely, target 
characteristics can also nefariously “crowd out” and positively bias what we per￾ceive. For instance, one study of more than ten thousand employees enrolled 
in professional development courses demonstrated that the course evaluations 
were largely affected by the trainers of these courses (who made the courses 
fun and enjoyable)—even beyond the quality of the course content itself, which 
should have been the primary focus of the evaluations.16 Based on these results, 
charismatic customers, leaders, entrepreneurs, and trainers can distort and sway 
perceptions of others.
Context Context matters too. The time at which we see an object or event 
can influence our attention, as can location, light, heat, or situational factors. 
For instance, if you invite a potential client into your office, and it is messy, 
they may be more likely to think you are not conscientious and that you are 
more disagreeable and anxious than if your office was neat.17 The group 
membership of both the target and perceiver matter as well, although the 
group membership of the perceiver seems to be the most important. As a mem￾ber of a team, you likely have strong norms regarding what is acceptable and 
unacceptable behavior. This “team context” would create a strong situation 
(see the chapter on personality and individual differences) that substantially 
affects how you perceive and rate others’ performance and organizational 
citizenship behaviors (OCBs).18
People are usually not aware of the factors that influence their view of reality. 
In fact, people are not even that perceptive about their own abilities.19 Thankfully, 
awareness and objective measures can reduce our perception distortions. For 
instance, when people are more aware of their own racial biases, they are more 
motivated to control their own prejudice and more attuned to perceiving their 
own biases.20 Let us next consider how we make perceptions of others.
Person Perception: Making Judgments 
About Others
The perception concepts most relevant to OB include person perceptions, or 
the perceptions people form about each other. Many of our perceptions of 
others are formed by first impressions and small cues that have little sup￾porting evidence. Let us unravel some of our other human tendencies that 
interfere with correct person perception, beginning with the evidence behind 
attribution theory.
Attribution Theory
When we observe people, we attempt to explain their behavior. Our perception 
and judgment of a person’s actions are influenced by the assumptions we make 
about that person’s state of mind.
Attribution theory tries to explain the ways we judge people differently depend￾ing on the meaning we attribute to their behavior.21 For instance, if your coworker 
is late to work, you might think it was because they were lazy or partying too hard 
6-2 Describe attribution theory.
attribution theory An attempt to explain 
the ways we judge people differently, 
depending on the meaning we attribute to 
a behavior, such as determining whether an 
individual’s behavior is internally or externally 
caused.
M06_ROBB0025_19_GE_C06.indd 204 13/12/22 2:40 AMPerception and Individual Decision Making CHAPTER 6 205
the night before—but would you say the same if you were late for work (or was it 
just the bad traffic)? Attributions also try to explain what we do as a result of our 
attributions. For example, supervisors are more likely to exploit or treat subordi￾nates poorly (e.g., making them work extra hours, giving them tedious tasks) if 
they judge them as being “passionate” about their work.22 In other words, they 
think it is okay to make them work harder if they see them as passionate about 
their work (e.g., they like what they do, so they will not mind doing more!). As 
another example, restaurant waitstaff who are mistreated by customers (and blame 
the customer) may stop going above and beyond for customers, resulting in nega￾tive customer reviews and recommendations for the restaurant.23
Internal and External Causation Attribution theory suggests that when we 
observe an individual’s behavior, we attempt to determine whether it was inter￾nally or externally caused. That determination depends largely on three factors: 
(1) distinctiveness, (2) consensus, and (3) consistency.24 Let us clarify the dif￾ferences between internal and external causation, and then we will discuss the 
determining factors.
Internally caused behaviors are those an observer believes to be under the 
personal behavioral control of another individual (e.g., coming to work late 
because the coworker is lazy). Externally caused behavior is what we imagine 
the situation forced the individual to do (e.g., coming to work late because of 
bad traffic). New research suggests that there may be another kind of external 
attribution, where our relationship with the other person is the reason for the 
behavior.25 For example, you may think a customer stopped doing business with 
your company because they are (1) disloyal to the company (e.g., internal), (2) 
cutting expenditures due to hard financial times (e.g., external), or (3) not get￾ting along with the new employee assigned to their account (e.g., relational).
A great deal of research is demonstrating how relational attributions impact 
interpersonal dynamics in the workplace. For instance, if you work with an 
exceptionally well-known performer (e.g., a star), you tend to be shielded from 
blame and credit for your contributions because others attribute your perfor￾mance to your relationship with the star employee.26 As another example, if you 
think your leader is only treating you and your coworkers well to keep the peace 
and maintain leader–follower relationships, you may feel less “special” and, as a 
result, engage in fewer OCBs.27
Distinctiveness, Consensus, and Consistency Distinctiveness refers to whether an 
individual displays different behavior in different situations. Is the employee 
who arrives late today also one who regularly “blows off” other kinds of commit￾ments? If no, we are likely to give it an external attribution. If yes, we will prob￾ably judge the behavior to be internal.
If everyone who faces a similar situation responds in the same way, we can say 
the behavior shows consensus. Were all employees who took the same route also 
late? If yes, you would probably give an external attribution to the employee’s 
tardiness (e.g., traffic or weather). If no, you would be more likely to attribute 
their lateness to an internal cause.
Finally, an observer looks for consistency in a person’s actions. Does the per￾son respond the same way over time? Coming in ten minutes late for work is not 
perceived the same for an employee who has not been late for several months as 
for an employee who is late three times a week. The more consistent the behav￾ior, the more we are inclined to attribute it to internal causes.
Exhibit 6-2 summarizes the key elements in attribution theory described in 
this section. It tells us, for instance, that if an employee, Alex, generally performs 
at about the same level on related tasks as they do on the current task (low 
distinctiveness), other employees frequently perform differently—better or 
M06_ROBB0025_19_GE_C06.indd 205 13/12/22 2:40 AM206 PART 2 The Individual
worse—than Alex on that task (low consensus), and Alex’s performance on this 
current task is consistent over time (high consistency), anyone judging Alex’s 
work will likely hold them primarily responsible for their task performance 
(internal attribution).
Errors and Biases in Attribution When we make judgments about the behavior 
of other people, we tend to underestimate the influence of external factors and 
overestimate the influence of internal or personal factors.28 This fundamental 
attribution error might explain why we might perceive the wealthy as intelli￾gent, savvy, or innately effective without considering the external factors that 
precluded their success (e.g., being born into a wealthy family).29
Similarly, people tend to attribute ambiguous information as relatively flat￾tering, accept positive feedback, and reject negative feedback. This is called 
self-serving bias.
30 Although much research focuses on the self-serving bias in 
business leaders and their negative effects, not all executives are self-serving—
many studies suggest that executives who are modest experience better career 
success and upward mobility, elicit positive investor reactions, and generally 
lead to higher team and firm performance.31
The evidence on cultural differences in perception is mixed, but most sug￾gests there are differences across cultures in the attributions people make, 
with collectivist cultures making external attributions more frequently than 
internal attributions.32 For example, an experimental study of Chinese and 
American collective arbitrators (people adjudicating disputes between an 
employer and a group of employees) found that in similar scenarios, Chinese 
arbitrators tend to impose harsher penalties than their American counterparts 
on organizations that have violated the terms of their contracts. This differ￾ence has been attributed in part to a tendency for Chinese arbitrators to attri￾bute responsibility for a violation to organizations and context rather than to 
individuals—a difference shaped by the influence of collectivist culture. This 
may also explain the findings of another study, based on the coverage of sev￾eral well-known business scandals: American newspapers referred more to the 
individual involved in each scandal, whereas Japanese newspapers referred 
more to the institution, implying a greater focus by the Japanese on the group 
than on the individual as an agent.33
Having introduced person perception, let’s consider the common shortcuts 
we use to simplify our processing of others’ behavior.
fundamental attribution error The 
tendency to underestimate the influence 
of external factors and overestimate the 
influence of internal factors when making 
judgments about the behavior of others.

individuals to attribute their own successes

failures on external factors.

 Volkswagen: Going Green or Just 
Greenwashing? 
 Just as people make sense of their 
immediate world, observing coworker, 
supervisor, and customer behaviors to 
figure out their actions, people do the 
same with organizations. Unfortunately, 
many employees, managers, and execu￾tives are aware of this fact, sometimes 
trying to use this to their advantage. Of 
course, it is one thing to manage oth￾ers’ perceptions and put your best foot 
forward as a company—that’s just good 
marketing. However, it is another thing 
entirely for organizations to misrepre￾sent themselves or manipulate others’ 
perceptions to suit their interests. In the 
modern cutthroat, competitive corporate 
world, many are doing everything they can 
to retain or capture market share. They 
do so even if it means behaving unethi￾cally through performative marketing. 
As Professor Burbano of the Columbia 
Business School notes, “These things 
create a demand for good environmen￾tal performance—and if you have poor 
environmental performance, there’s a 
temptation to pretend that that’s not 
the case.” For instance, some organiza￾tions try to “greenwash” their practices 
to make them appear as engaging in 
socially responsible practices. 
 One example was a scandal that hit 
Volkswagen (VW), referred to by some 
as “Dieselgate” or the “Diesel Dupe.” 
As a part of a major push to sell diesel￾powered cars in the United States, VW 
engaged in a massive marketing cam￾paign to tout its cars’ (e.g., the Jetta, 
Beetle, Golf, Passat) low emissions. The 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
discovered that more than 11  million 
VW vehicles were being sold in America 
and Europe that did not meet the low 
emissions standards. However, it was 
not a mistake in manufacturing, a glitch, 
or some other unforeseen issue that 
caused the unmet standards. VW fitted 
its cars with complex software designed 
to provide false emission test readings. 
Dubbed a “defeat device,” this soft￾ware could detect whether it was being 
tested and alter its readings to improve 
performance on the test. When tested 
under controlled laboratory conditions, 
these cars would sense these condi￾tions and monitor speed, engine opera￾tion, air pressure, and even steering 
wheel position to operate below typical 
performance. Once outside of these con￾ditions, the car would switch out of this 
mode and operate below standards. By 
some estimates, these un-green engines 
emitted forty times the legal limit for pol￾lutant emissions. Worse yet, this is not 
the first time an automobile company, 
let  alone VW, has attempted to install 
these defeat devices in its automobiles. 
General Motors (GM) faced a similar 
scandal in the 1990s. VW was accused 
and found guilty of similar practices as 
early as the 1970s. 
 Although such actions are illegal, 
there is often more incentive for an orga￾nization to “take a chance” on deceptive 
practices than to do the right thing. The 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can 
issue cease-and-desist orders, prison 
sentences, and fines of up to $16,000 
per violation. However, it is not required 
for companies to report corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) performance data, 
and compliance guidelines are ambigu￾ous. Furthermore, many terms surround￾ing green practices are vague (e.g., how 
would one define “all-natural?”). When 
greenwashing is caught, a different set 
of attributional processes begin that 
many companies do not anticipate. 
Customers become aware of the com￾pany’s practices and make separate 
attributions of their intent and worthi￾ness of their business. In the wake of 
this scandal, VW America’s head said, 
“We’ve totally screwed up” and “broken 
the trust of our customers and public.” 
The replacement head of VW America 
further noted, “My most urgent task is 
to win back trust for the Volkswagen 
Group—by leaving no stone unturned.” 
 But can companies survive the 
fallout after greenwashing attempts? 
Research makes it clear that these 
attributional processes play a role at 
all stages of this process: when cus￾tomers initially view corporate CSR 
messaging, in the wake of a scandal 
and corporate apologies, and even at 
lower levels when viewing their super￾visors’ or coworkers’ prosocial efforts. 
In other words, people harbor percep￾tions of others’ seemingly prosocial 
actions and may begin to think nega￾tively of them (e.g., as “sucking up” 
or “going through the motions”). For 
instance, one study examined custom￾ers who became aware of a product 
recall that a company was responsible 
for preventing (and had control over). 
These customers were more likely to 
blame that company, develop negative 
attitudes toward that company, commit 
to no longer purchasing the product, 
and even recommend legal damage 
payouts to those affected. On the other 
hand, the opposite is true when people 
perceive that CSR actions are genuine. 
As such, CSR, when done well, can still 
be an excellent practice for the man￾ager, employee, and consumer advo￾cacy of a company. 34

Common Shortcuts in Judging Others
Shortcuts for judging others often allow us to make perceptions rapidly and 
provide data for making predictions. However, they can often result in signifi￾cant distortions.
Selective Perception We often choose (sometimes unconsciously) the information 
we take in from the environment based on our background, motivations, and char￾acteristics. This is called selective perception. For example, organizational leaders 
are motivated to focus on financial metrics and the bottom line while effectively 
ignoring employees and their job satisfaction, which we know from the chapter on 
job attitudes is important to organizational effectiveness.35 Some research suggests 
that if we are directed to focus on more in our environment, we will; for example, 
if job satisfaction is emphasized as important by the top management team, then 
other managers will see it as important and will no longer ignore it.36
Halo and Horns Effects When we draw a positive impression about an individual 
based on a single characteristic, such as intelligence, sociability, or appearance, a 
halo effect is operating.37 The horns effect, on the other hand, is when we draw 
a negative impression from a single characteristic. These effects are easy to demon￾strate. Imagine a recruiter meeting with two applicants for an initial interview.38
One was very friendly and sociable—it is easy for the recruiter to conclude that this 
applicant will also be clever, smart, or good at their job, even though the characteris￾tics may be unrelated. In other words, the halo effect creates a positive, clouded first 
impression. The other applicant was loud and off-putting—it would be easy, again, 
to conclude that this applicant will not be clever, smart or good at their job. In other 
words, the horns effect creates a negative, clouded first impression.
Contrast Effects It is performance appraisal “season,” and everyone in your 
workplace is anxious to receive their evaluation. The boss begins scheduling 
meetings, and you hear through the grapevine that Regan is going up first—
Regan is the star performer in the office and will be a hard act to follow. Everyone 
in the office will probably look bad in comparison to Regan! This example dem￾onstrates how the contrast effect can distort perceptions.39 We do not evaluate a 
person in isolation. Our reaction is influenced by other people we have recently 
encountered. For example, one study examined teams in an organization that 
was undergoing radical change and new leader appointments. Teammates pro￾vided support toward and reacted more positively to an effective new leader 
when the previous leader was not very effective (i.e., a contrast effect). However, 
if the previous leader was effective, the new leader’s behaviors mattered much 
less, even if what the new leader was recommending was desirable.40
Stereotyping We deal with our complex world’s unmanageable number of 
stimuli by using stereotypes or shortcuts called heuristics to make decisions 
quickly. For example, it does make sense to assume that your coworker from 
finance will be able to help you figure out a forecasting problem. The chal￾lenge occurs when we generalize inaccurately or make irrational “leaps” based 
on these shortcuts. When we judge someone based on our perception of the 
group to which they belong, we are stereotyping.
41 As you may recall from our 
discussion earlier in the text, stereotyping is an extreme shortcut taken in 
organizational decision making. Stereotyping can mar business processes, 
like recruitment and hiring. For example, in one study, more than 6,500 U.S. 
professors were sent fake letters by fictitious students asking about graduate 
school and research opportunities—the content of these letters was all the 
same, except the names were changed to correspond with “stereotypically” 
selective perception The tendency to 
choose to interpret what one sees based on 
one’s interests, background, experience, and 
attitudes.
halo effect The tendency to draw a positive 
general impression about an individual 
based on a single characteristic.
horns effect The tendency to draw a 
negative general impression about an 
individual based on a single characteristic.
contrast effect Evaluation of a person’s 
characteristics that is affected by 
comparisons with other people recently 
encountered who rank higher or lower on the 
same characteristics.

Black, Chinese, Hispanic, Indian, and White names.42 These professors tended 
to be significantly more responsive to White males than other students.
It should be obvious by now that our perceptions distort our outlook. These 
perceptions filter into several business processes, such as employment inter￾views and performance evaluations.
Specific Applications of Shortcuts in Organizations
People in organizations are always judging each other. Managers must appraise 
their employees’ performances. We evaluate how much effort our coworkers are 
putting into their jobs. Team members immediately “size up” a new person. In 
many cases, our judgments have important consequences for the organization. 
Let’s look at the most obvious applications.
Employment Interview Few people are hired without an interview. But inter￾viewers make perceptual judgments that are often inaccurate and draw from 
early impressions that quickly become entrenched.43 Research shows that we 
form impressions of others within a tenth of a second based on our first glance.44
Most interviewers’ decisions change very little after the first four or five minutes 
of an interview. Thus, information elicited early in the interview carries greater 
weight than does information elicited later, and a “good applicant” is probably 
characterized more by the absence of unfavorable characteristics than by the 
presence of favorable ones.45 Our individual intuition about a job candidate is 
not reliable in predicting job performance, so collecting input from multiple 
independent evaluators can be predictive.46
Performance Expectations People attempt to validate their perceptions of real￾ity even when these perceptions are faulty. The terms self-fulfilling prophecy
and Pygmalion effect describe how an individual’s behavior is determined by oth￾ers’ expectations.47 If a manager expects big things from the team, they are not 
likely to let the manager down. Similarly, if the manager expects only minimal 
performance, the employees will likely meet those low expectations. Expectations 
become reality. The self-fulfilling prophecy has been found to affect the perfor￾mance of students, soldiers, accountants, and a number of other occupations.48
self-fulfilling prophecy A situation in which 
an individual’s behavior is determined by 
others’ expectations, even if untrue. In other 
words, if someone holds misrepresented 
or unfounded expectations about another 
person, that person may make these 
hypothetical, unfounded expectations into 
a reality.
Nurse Li Hongfei, who works at No. 4 
People’s Hospital in Shenyang, China, 
experiences negative stereotyping 
based on his gender. Like Li, male 
nurses in many countries report that 
gender stereotyping generalizes inac￾curately that nursing is a profession 
for women only because men lack the 
patience, empathy, and compassion 
required to succeed as a nurse.

Performance Evaluations We will discuss performance evaluations more in the 
human resources chapter, but note that they very much depend on perceptual 
processes.49 An employee’s future is closely tied to their appraisal—promotion, 
pay raises, and continuation of employment are among the outcomes. Although 
the appraisal can be somewhat objective (for example, a salesperson is appraised 
on how many dollars of sales generated), many jobs are evaluated subjectively. 
Subjective evaluations, though often necessary, are problematic because of the 
errors we have discussed. Sometimes performance ratings say as much about 
the evaluator as they do about the employee!
Social Media Social media and the Internet have made it easier than ever to 
obtain information about other people. This imperfect window into others’ 
lives opens the possibility of employees and managers making shortcut evalu￾ations of others, such as applicants and candidates—sometimes without even 
meeting them in person. And the evaluations work both ways—customer and 
client evaluations of organizations (e.g., negative reviews on Twitter) can have 
a massive impact on organizations,50 in some cases even leading stock analysts 
to make or withhold recommendations of the target companies.51
Within the context of recruitment and hiring, about four in every ten orga￾nizations use social media or online searches to screen applicants or candi￾dates for jobs, according to a 2016 Society for Human Resource Management 
(SHRM) survey.52 Despite its increasing popularity, using social media for hiring 
can result in biased decision making that could potentially spell legal trouble 
for companies if they discriminate against protected classes (see the chapter on 
diversity).
53 For instance, the University of Kentucky paid a $125,000 settlement 
to an astronomy professor when they removed him from consideration for a 
position due to his outspoken belief of creationism on social media.54
Indeed, research supports the social media decision-making bias link. In a 
series of studies using Facebook profiles, researchers found that when the appli￾cant’s political affiliation displayed on their social media matched the hiring man￾ager’s, the manager was more likely to perceive the applicant as similar, likeable, a 
potentially strong performer, and more hirable than one with a different political 
affiliation.55 Furthermore, a separate series of studies demonstrated that Facebook 
profiles provide hiring managers with non-work-related information (e.g., demo￾graphic characteristics, profanity, and sexual behavior) that should not be the basis 
for hiring. Even systematically structuring the assessment of Facebook profiles (like 
a structured interview; see the chapter on human resources) was not enough to 
eliminate these biases,56 although some research has shown promise for network￾ing sites specifically dedicated to work-relevant information (e.g., LinkedIn).57
Potential Remedies Technology has been proving useful in combatting 
these biases—for example, AI-assisted performance assessments and other 
decision-support systems can help reduce these common shortcuts in judging oth￾ers.58 These types of “mechanical” data analytic methods are very effective—in fact, 
one review of studies found that mechanical methods were 50 percent more effec￾tive than subjective methods at judging job performance.59 However, as we note in 
the introductory chapter, it is still unclear whether AI itself can lead to bias depend￾ing on how it is programmed. As another example, research suggests that decision￾making errors stem from lapses in attention and memory. Organizations should 
do what they can do to ensure that employees feel as if they are in control of their 
environment to lessen attentional resource-draining demands. Since the advent of 
COVID-19, telecommuting and remote work have become more common and may 
be ways in which cognitive errors at work can be avoided by enabling employees to 
have control over their environments and protect resources.60

 One problem with stereotypes and other biases is that they are based on gen￾eralizations, although they may not contain a shred of truth when applied to a 
particular person or situation. We must monitor ourselves to make sure we are 
not unfairly applying a stereotype in our evaluations and decisions. Stereotypes 
are an example of the warning “The more useful, the more danger from misuse.” 
Regardless, understanding the link between perception and decision making, as 
we discuss in the next section, can help us recognize when our perceptions are 
interfering with our ability to make effective decisions. 
 The Link Between Perception and 
Individual Decision Making 
 Individuals make decisions , or choices from among two or more alternatives. 62
Ideally, decision making would be objective rather than subjective, but the 
ways individuals make decisions are largely influenced by their perceptions. In 
fact, according to a recent survey (see OB Poll), many managers spend at least 
31 percent of their time on decision making. It may be tempting to think that 
spending more time on decision making naturally makes you better at it—but 
over 60 percent of managers report that less than half of the time they spend on 
decision making is actually effective regardless of the amount of time they spend on it . 
 Decision making occurs as a reaction to a problem . That is, a discrepancy exists 
between how things are and how we want them to be, requiring us to consider 
 decisions Choices made from among two 
or more alternatives. 
 problem A discrepancy between the 
current state and some desired state. 
 Myth or Science? All Stereotypes Are Negative 
 T
his statement is false. Positive 
stereotypes exist as much as neg￾ative ones. 
 A study of Princeton University stu￾dents shows, for example, that even 
today many people believe Germans 
are better workers, Italians and Black 
people are more loyal, Jews and 
Chinese are more intelligent, and 
Japanese and English are more courte￾ous. What is surprising is that positive 
stereotypes are not always positive. 
 We may be more likely to “choke” 
(fail to perform) when we identify with 
positive stereotypes because they 
induce pressure to perform at the ste￾reotypical level. For example, men are 
commonly believed to have higher math 
ability than women. A study showed that 
when this stereotype is activated before 
men take a math test, their performance 
on the test decreases. The belief that 
White men are better at science and 
math than women or ethnic minorities 
caused White men in another study to 
leave science, technology, engineer￾ing, and math majors. One study used 
basketball to illustrate the complexity 
of stereotypes. Researchers provided 
evidence to one group of undergradu￾ates that White players were better at 
free throws than Black players. Another 
group was provided evidence that Black 
players were better at free throws than 
White players. A third group was given 
no stereotypical information. The under￾graduates in all three groups then shot 
free throws while observers watched. 
The people who performed the worst 
were those in the negative stereotype 
condition (Black undergraduates who 
were told White players were better and 
White undergraduates who were told 
Black players were better). However, the 
positive stereotype group (Black under￾graduates who were told Black players 
were better and White undergraduates 
who were told White players were better) 
also did not perform well. The best per￾formance was by those in the group with￾out stereotypic information. 
 “Choking” is not the only nega￾tive thing about positive stereotypes. 
Research revealed that when women or 
Asian Americans heard positive stereo￾types about themselves (“women are 
nurturing”; “Asians are good at math”), 
they felt depersonalized and reacted 
negatively to the individual express￾ing the positive stereotype. Another 
study showed that positive stereotypes 
about Black people solidified negative 
stereotypes because any stereotype 
tends to reinforce group-based differ￾ences, whether positive or negative. 
 Stereotypes are understandable. To 
function, we need shortcuts; however, 
shortcuts run both ways. Because ste￾reotypes are socially learned, we need 
to be vigilant about not accepting or 
propagating them among our cowork￾ers and peers. 61

how we can address this discrepancy. If your Wi-Fi router breaks down and you 
rely on it to telecommute, you have a problem that requires a decision on your 
part. Unfortunately, most problems do not come neatly labeled. One person’s 
problem is another’s desired state. One manager may view their division’s 2 percent 
decline in quarterly sales to be a serious problem requiring immediate action on 
their part. The manager’s counterpart in another division, who also had a 2 per￾cent sales decrease, might consider it quite acceptable. Awareness that a problem 
exists and that a decision might (or might not) be needed is a perceptual issue. 
 Every decision requires us to interpret and evaluate information. We typically 
receive data from multiple sources that we need to screen, process, and interpret. 
Which data are relevant to the decision, and which are not? Our perceptions help 
us, accurately or inaccurately, answer that question. We must consider how our 
perceptions of the situation influence our decisions, sometimes in ways we would 
not expect. For example, employees should be especially receptive to problems 
during times of economic instability. (Times are hard, and they want to keep their 
jobs!) However, when other employment opportunities are scarce, employees may 
be motivated to deny or ignore that there are problems in their organization. 63 
 Decision Making in Organizations 
 Business schools typically train students to follow rational decision-making models. 
While such models have merit, they do not always describe how people make deci￾sions. OB improves the way we make decisions in organizations by addressing both 
perceptual and decision-making errors. First, we describe some decision-making 
approaches, and then we outline a few of the most common errors. 
 The Rational Model, Bounded Rationality, and Intuition 
 In OB, rational decision making, bounded rationality, and intuition are gener￾ally accepted approaches to decision making. However, they may not lead to the 
most accurate (or best) decisions. More importantly, there are times when one 
strategy may lead to a better outcome than another in a given situation. 
6- 4 Contrast the rational model 
of decision making with 
bounded rationality and 
intuition.

Rational Decision Making We often think the best decision maker is rational
and makes consistent, value-maximizing choices within specified constraints.64
In other words, good decision makers consistently make choices that enable 
them to enjoy the most benefits, given the situation. Rational decisions follow a 
six-step rational decision-making model65 (see Exhibit 6-3).
The rational decision-making model assumes the decision maker has com￾plete information, can identify all relevant options without bias, and chooses 
the option with the highest utility.66 However, most decisions do not follow this 
model; people are usually content to find an acceptable or reasonable solution to 
a problem rather than an optimal one. We tend to be limited in time, resources, 
and awareness, leading us to focus on the symptoms of the problem and cur￾rent, possible solutions. As one expert in decision making put it, “Organizations 
pursue intelligence. It is not a trivial goal. Its realization is imperfect and the 
pursuit is endless.”67 Despite this “imperfect” and “endless” pursuit, people are 
remarkably unaware that they are making constrained, suboptimal decisions.68
Bounded Rationality Often, we do not follow the rational decision-making 
model for a reason: Our limited abilities to process information make it impos￾sible to assimilate all the information we need, even if it is readily obtainable.69
Because we cannot solve complex problems with full rationality, we operate 
within the confines of bounded rationality. We take a simplified approach, per￾ceiving and interpreting the essential features of problems without capturing 
their complexity. We then behave rationally within these boundaries.
To use the rational model, you need to gather a great deal of information 
about all the options, compute applicable weights, and then calculate values 
across a huge number of criteria. All these processes can cost time, energy, and 
money. Many problems do not have an optimal solution because they are too 
complicated to fit the rational decision-making model. Furthermore, if we were 
to use the rational approach, we may run into a situation where the problem is 
intractable. An intractable problem occurs when we spend so much time organiz￾ing the decision-making process, gathering information, and engaging in analy￾sis and judgment that by the time we finish doing so, the problem has changed 
entirely or become irrelevant.70
Instead of engaging in these intensive, rational processes, in some situations 
we reduce complex problems to a level we can readily understand. One outcome 
of bounded rationality is a tendency to satisfice, or seek solutions that are merely 
sufficient (e.g., “good enough”). While the satisficing answer is acceptable but not 
necessarily optimal, it is not always a bad method. Often, a simple process may fre￾quently be more sensible than the traditional rational decision-making model.71
Bounded rationality can be of concern in ethical decision making (as dis￾cussed later in this chapter). Not only are we prone to make systematic and pre￾dictable errors in ethical decisions, but our perceptions of whether we have the 
freedom or right to behave in a particular way are bounded by our duties toward 
the people our actions affect.72 For example, you want to take the last doughnut 
in the break room, but you know that you should not in case someone has not

had one yet. Researchers have identified ways in which the automatic effects of 
our bounded rationality can be addressed: Be sure to ask multiple questions to 
understand the situation better, draw on multiple sources of information, evalu￾ate your sources of information, and leave enough time to decide.73
Intuition Perhaps the least rational way of making decisions is intuitive decision 
making, an unconscious process created from distilled experience.74 Intuitive 
decision making occurs outside conscious thought; relies on holistic associa￾tions, or links between disparate pieces of information; is fast; and is affectively 
charged, meaning it engages the emotions.75 While intuition is not rational, it 
is not inherently bad or necessarily wrong, nor does it always contradict ratio￾nal analysis. Within the confines of bounded rationality, in situations requiring 
quick decisions (e.g., crises) or highly risky or uncertain contexts, we may need 
to rely on experts’ intuitions to identify quick solutions or take desirable risks.76
Does intuition help effective decision making? Researchers are divided, but 
most experts are skeptical, in part because intuition is hard to measure and 
analyze. Furthermore, intuition can lead you to “close your eyes to follow your 
heart,” or ignore contradictory information to protect your intuition, even when 
it is not correct.77 Much of the research on dozens of decision-making studies 
suggests that intuition, although it “feels right,” does not correspond with ratio￾nally made decisions and perhaps leads to inaccurate decisions.78 Probably the 
best advice from one expert is “Intuition can be very useful as a way of setting 
up a hypothesis but is unacceptable as ‘proof.’” Use hunches derived from your 
experience to speculate, yes, but always make sure to test those hunches with 
objective data and rational, dispassionate analysis.79
As you can see, the more we use objective processes for decision making, the 
more likely we are to correct some of the problems with our perceptual process. Just 
as there are biases and errors in the perception process, it stands to reason there are 
identifiable biases and errors in our decision making, which we will outline next.
Common Biases and Errors in Decision Making
We often think of vital, critical judgments of decision makers as careful and 
deliberate. However, bias and error affect decision makers at all levels of orga￾nizations. For instance, scientific peer review is not immune; many of the same 
biases that behavioral scientists study also infect the peer review process.80
Indeed, systematic biases and errors can creep into the judgments of deci￾sion makers.81 To minimize effort and avoid trade-offs, people tend to rely too 
heavily on experience, impulses, gut feelings, and convenient rules of thumb. 
Exhibit 6-4 provides some suggestions for avoiding these biases and errors.
Overconfidence Bias We tend to be too confident about our abilities and the 
abilities of others, but we are usually not aware of this overconfidence bias.
82
This overconfidence can emerge in organizations, especially during informal 
interviews. For example, hiring managers may be overconfident about how 
well they evaluate candidates after an informal interview.83 Furthermore, some 
research shows hiring managers can be overconfident in their evaluation of stig￾matized candidates (e.g., candidates with facial scars or birthmarks), even when 
it is clear they were prejudiced in their decisions.84
Individuals whose intellectual and interpersonal abilities are weakest are most 
likely to overestimate their performance and ability.85 There is also a negative 
relationship between entrepreneurs’ optimism and performance of their new 
ventures: the more optimistic, the more likely they are to start a new business 
quickly, persist too long in the market, and overall become the least success￾ful.86 The tendency to be too confident about their ideas might keep some from 
intuitive decision making An unconscious 
process created out of distilled experience.
overconfidence bias A tendency to be 
overconfident about our own abilities or the 
abilities of others.

planning how to avoid problems that arise. Research also demonstrates that 
once entrepreneurs establish their businesses, founder CEOs tend to be much 
more overconfident than their successors. One study “scraping” CEO earnings 
calls, press releases, and social media posts found that founder CEOs use highly 
optimistic language, inflate earnings forecasts, and perceived their firms to be 
undervalued compared to their successor counterparts.87
Investor overconfidence operates in a variety of ways.88 Finance professor 
Terrance Odean says, “People think they know more than they do, and it costs 
them.” Investors, especially novices, overestimate not just their skill in process￾ing information but also the quality of the information. Most investors will do 
only as well as or just slightly better than the market.
Overconfidence also has a relationship with leadership emergence (which 
we discuss in the chapter on leadership). People are more likely to select the 
overconfident as leaders as they tend to ease their sense of ambiguity and over￾confidence fits the perceiver’s understanding of what it means to be a leader.89
Furthermore, overconfidence bias is more likely to emerge in leaders who are 
powerful, ambitious, and of a higher social class and, in some cases, leads to 
higher firm performance.90 However, despite initial benefits, overconfidence 
may eventually backfire: As overconfidence is revealed (the person’s behaviors 
are not as good as they say they are or their claims are falsifiable), people begin 
to perceive the overconfident person negatively, which damages their reputa￾tion.91 Overconfidence also affects the extent to which managers and executives 
take risks, viewing all feedback (e.g., financial performance data) optimistically.92
Anchoring Bias Anchoring bias is a tendency to fixate on initial information 
and fail to adequately adjust to subsequent information.93 Similar to the halo 
and horns effects discussed earlier, the mind appears to disproportionately 
emphasize the first information it receives. Anchors are widely used by people 
anchoring bias A tendency to fixate on 
initial information, from which one then 
fails to adjust adequately for subsequent 
information.
Exhibit 6-4 Reducing Biases and Errors
Focus on Goals. Without goals, you cannot be rational, you do not know what information
you need, you do not know which information is relevant and which is irrelevant, you will
find itdifficult to choose between alternatives, and you are far more likely to experience
regret over the choices you make. Clear goals make decision making easier and help you
eliminateoptions that are inconsistent with your interests.
Look for Information That Disconfirms Your Beliefs. One of the most effective means for
counteracting overconfidence and the confirmation and hindsight biases is to actively look
for information that contradicts your beliefs and assumptions. When we overtly consider
various ways we could be wrong, we challenge our tendencies to think we are smarter than 
we actually are.
Do Not Try to Create Meaning out of Random Events.The educated mind has been trained
to look for cause-and-effect relationships. When something happens, we ask why. And
when we cannot find reasons, we often invent them. You have to accept that there are events
in life that are outside your control. Ask yourself if patterns can be meaningfully explained
or whether they are merely coincidence. Do not attempt to create meaning out of
coincidence.
Increase Your Options. No matter how many options you have identified, your final choice can 
be no better than the best of the option set you have selected. This argues for increasing your
decision alternatives and for using creativity in developing a wide range of diverse choices.
The more alternatives you can generate, and the more diverse those alternatives, the
greater your chance of finding an outstanding one.

in professions in which persuasion skills are important—advertising, manage￾ment, politics, real estate, and law. For instance, executives might draw on the 
numbers from others’ recent international acquisition decisions to determine 
how much equity to purchase in international firms.94
Any time a negotiation takes place, so does anchoring. When a prospec￾tive employer asks how much you made in your prior job, your answer typically 
anchors the employer’s offer. (Remember this when you negotiate your salary, but 
set the anchor only as high as you truthfully can.) The more precise your anchor, 
the smaller the subsequent adjustments during negotiation. Some research sug￾gests people think of making an adjustment after an anchor is set as rounding off 
a number: If you suggest a salary of $55,000, your boss will consider $50,000 to 
$60,000 a reasonable range for negotiation, but if you mention $55,650, your boss 
is more likely to consider $55,000 to $56,000 the range of likely values.95
Confirmation Bias The rational decision-making process assumes we objectively 
gather information. But we do not. We selectively gather it. Confirmation bias rep￾resents a case of selective perception: We seek out (and accept) information that 
reaffirms our past choices and current views, and we discount (or are skeptical of) 
information that challenges them.96 We even tend to seek sources most likely to 
tell us what we want to hear, and we give too much weight to supporting informa￾tion and too little to contradictory information. The confirmation bias applies to 
person perception (discussed earlier in this chapter): Once we settle on a trait 
attribution, we seek out and accept information that reaffirms this perception.97
For example, if your supervisor sees you as unreliable, they are more likely to 
perceive when you are unreliable than when you are reliable. Confirmation bias 
may be especially troublesome for entrepreneurs and startups, given the conse￾quences of making faulty decisions in new ventures and failing to learn quickly.98
The advent of social media has created an “echo chamber” of sorts, with con￾firmation bias running rampant.99 Advertising algorithms profit off confirmation 
bias by tailoring messages toward people inclined to believe them.100 To combat 
these confirmation biases in your work and nonwork lives, seek out and critically 
evaluate information that counters your beliefs or opinions. As Walt Whitman 
wrote in Song of Myself, “Listen to all sides and filter them from yourself.”101
Availability Bias Availability bias is our tendency to base judgments on readily 
available information. Events that evoke emotions are particularly vivid, and 
those that are more recent tend to be more available in our memory, leading 
us to overestimate the chances of unlikely events.102 This can lead us to 
overestimate the chances of unlikely events, such as being in an airplane crash, 
suffering complications from medical treatment, or getting fired.103 Availability 
bias can help explain why managers give more weight in performance appraisals 
to recent employee behaviors than to behaviors of six to nine months earlier.104
Because the challenges people have faced are often more salient than times 
when things have gone well, employees may also tend to believe they have it 
worse than others.105 For example, employees who have been on the job longer 
may discount the work experiences of newer employees as “easier” because they 
focus more on their own challenging experiences rather than when things were 
easier for them. Availability bias might even be operating now as you are navi￾gating and exploring potential careers and occupations—you may be attracted 
toward or repelled from careers based on (potentially inaccurate) information 
or experiences with those careers.106
Escalation of Commitment Another distortion that creeps into decisions 
is a tendency to persist even when there is evidence that one should try a 
confirmation bias The tendency to seek 
out information that reaffirms past choices 
and to discount information that contradicts 
past judgments.
availability bias The tendency for people to 
base their judgments on information that is 
readily available to them.

different approach or give up, often driven by nonrational reasons. Escalation 
of commitment, also referred to as the sunk cost effect, refers to our staying with a 
decision even if there is clear evidence that it is wrong.
When is escalation most likely to occur? Evidence indicates that it occurs when 
individuals view themselves as responsible for the outcome or when they feel like 
they will eventually succeed.107 The fear of personal failure even biases the way 
we search for and evaluate information so that we choose only information that 
supports our dedication.108 It does not appear to matter whether we chose the 
failing course of action or it was assigned to us—we feel responsible and escalate 
in either case. Also, the sharing of decision authority—such as when others review 
the choice we made—can lead to higher escalation.109 Recent research on entre￾preneurial teams suggests that it is not only sharing authority that leads to escala￾tion, but rather the collective emotions the team experiences: Hope of eventually 
attaining the goal tends to trump the fear of failure.110
We usually think of escalation of commitment as ungrounded. However, per￾sistence in the face of failure is responsible for many of history’s greatest feats: 
the building of the Pyramids, the Great Wall of China, the Panama Canal, and 
the Empire State Building among them. Researchers suggest that a balanced 
approach includes frequent evaluation of alternative courses of actions, the 
spent costs, and whether the next step is worth the anticipated costs.111 What we 
want to combat is the tendency to automatically escalate commitment.
Randomness Error People default toward believing that they have some control 
over the world. Our tendency to believe we can predict the outcome of random 
events is the randomness error.
Decision making suffers when we try to create meaning in random events, 
particularly when we turn imaginary patterns into superstitions.112 These can 
be completely contrived (“I never make important decisions on Friday the 
13th”) or they can evolve from a reinforced past pattern of behavior (Tiger 
Woods wears a red shirt playing golf on Sundays because he won many junior 
tournaments wearing red shirts).113 They can also result from the stress of 
emotional dissonance (see the chapter on emotions and moods). Studies 
show that stress reduces the individual’s sense of control, and that to regain 
control, people may engage in magical rituals or superstitions like knocking 
on wood.114
Risk Aversion Mathematically speaking, we should find a fifty-fifty flip of 
the coin for $100 to be worth as much as a sure promise of $50. After all, the 
expected value of the gamble over several trials is $50. However, nearly everyone 
would rather have the sure thing than a risky prospect.115 For many people, a 
fifty-fifty flip of a coin even for $200 might not be worth as much as a sure prom￾ise of $50, even though the gamble is mathematically worth twice as much! This 
tendency to prefer a sure thing over a risky outcome is risk aversion.
Overall, the framing of a decision has an effect on whether people will engage in 
risk-averse behavior—when decisions are framed positively, such as a potential gain 
of $50, people will be more risk averse. (Conversely, when the decision is framed in 
a negative manner, such as a loss of $50, people will engage in riskier behaviors.)116
Based on a storied program of research several decades ago, Professor Daniel 
Kahneman won a Nobel Prize in 2002 for the finding that people assess their gains 
and losses in this way.117 The influence of framing and risk aversion are undoubt￾edly some of the most critical biases that can be encountered in the workplace.
CEOs at risk of termination are exceptionally risk averse, even when a riskier 
investment strategy is in their firms’ best interests.118 Organizations have a stron￾ger hold on employees who are more risk averse because these employees tend to

perceive that they have more to lose and are less likely to leave the organization.119
Risk preference is sometimes reversed: People take chances when trying to prevent 
a negative outcome.120 They may thus risk losing a lot of money at trial rather than 
settle for less out of court. Stressful situations can make risk preferences stronger. 
People under stress are more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior to avoid neg￾ative outcomes and in risk-averse behavior when seeking positive outcomes.121
Hindsight Bias Hindsight bias is the tendency to believe falsely, after the out￾come is known, that we would have accurately predicted it.122 When we have 
feedback on the outcome, we seem good at concluding it was obvious.
For instance, Or Shani, the founder of Albert Technologies (the maker of the 
first autonomous digital marketer), notes that marketers this decade struggled 
with creating seamlessly digital technologies to replace their cumbersome manual 
processes—it was easy to conclude in hindsight that cumbersome digital systems 
would merely replace cumbersome manual processes (and that innovation was a 
futile exercise).123 The state of marketing, according to Shani, has not fully real￾ized its digital transformation as a result (although Shani believes AI will be the 
final “push” that will fully bring marketing into the digital age).124 What seems 
obvious now in hindsight tempts us to think we would have predicted it, and many 
experts actually fail to predict industry trends in advance or give up altogether in 
the face of one failure or setback. Though criticisms of decision makers may have 
merit, as Malcolm Gladwell, author of Blink and The Tipping Point, writes, “What is 
clear in hindsight is rarely clear before the fact.”125
Outcome Bias Outcome bias is the tendency to judge the quality of a decision 
based on the desirability or believability of its outcome.126 If we have informa￾tion about the quality of an outcome, we may jump to the conclusion that the 
decision was strong (even though the decision-making process itself may have 
been flawed). Furthermore, we may also judge decisions with outcomes that do 
not seem believable or logical as faulty. These processes occur if the effort that it 
would take to thoroughly judge a decision is more cumbersome than just evaluat￾ing the believability or desirability of the outcome.127 In turn, decision makers use 
more lenient criteria in judging decisions with believable, desirable outcomes.128
Outcome bias is particularly an issue with performance ratings and appraisal.129
For instance, sales managers who focus too much on the outcome (e.g., increased 
sales) in evaluating sales professionals may overlook the methods through which 
they attain increased sales (e.g., fudging the numbers, high-pressure tactics 
directed toward customers). Outcome bias can also operate in the extent to which 
employees and managers accept evidence and information that might guide their 
actions. For instance, although evidence may support or refute the effectiveness 
of a politicized business practice (e.g., government regulation),130 employees 
or managers may dismiss it outright because it goes against their beliefs (e.g., 
claiming that it is “fake news”).131 Finally, outcome bias is often used to sales pro￾fessionals’ advantage.132 For instance, sales professionals will often focus on the 
desirability of the outcome (e.g., “Imagine a life free of back pain”) or ask rapid￾fire, logical questions to capitalize on customer beliefs (e.g., “Do you wake up in 
back pain every day?” “Have you tried other solutions?” “Would you do anything 
to free yourself from back pain?”) in their sales pitches.
Before we move on to the next sections, it is important to consider what we 
can do to limit the extent to which biases affect our decision making. Employees 
and managers would do well to take a step back and (1) reflect and reframe 
problems in different ways; (2) undergo training on structured decision-making 
approaches to rely less on fast, emotional heuristics; and (3) alter the way in 
which decisions are made to reduce bias, such as through setting explicit stan￾dards for decisions.133 The first piece of advice is especially salient, given newer 
hindsight bias The tendency to believe 
falsely, after an outcome of an event is 
known, that one would have accurately 
predicted that outcome.

research that suggests that all biases are rooted in focusing on the most salient 
information and insensitivity to alternatives—the more we truly consider other 
options (and not the most salient), the less likely we are to default to biased 
decision making.134 We are all susceptible to biases, but are we all susceptible 
to the same degree? It is not likely. Our individual differences play a significant 
role in our decision-making processes, while our organizations constrain the 
range of our available decision choices.
Influences on Decision Making: Individual 
Differences and Organizational Constraints
Many factors, such as individual differences and organizational constraints, 
influence the way people make decisions and the degree to which they are sus￾ceptible to errors and biases.
Individual Differences
As we discussed, decision making in practice is characterized by bounded ratio￾nality, common biases and errors, and the use of intuition. Individual differ￾ences such as personality also create deviations from the rational model.
Personality Several personality traits are related to taking on specific 
decision-making strategies or to experiencing errors or biases during decision￾making. First, employees differ in the extent to which they trust their intuitions, 
and this can lead them to make a riskier decision or even to be harsher when 
condemning unethical behavior.135 Second, people with high self-esteem (see 
the chapter on personality and individual differences) are strongly motivated to 
maintain it, so they use the self-serving biases to preserve it. They may be more 
prone to blame others for their failures while taking credit for successes.136 Third, 
narcissists (see the chapter on personality and individual differences) naturally 
tend to be prone to overconfidence or overclaiming and to self-serving biases.137
Several personality traits from the Big Five Model are also relevant for decision 
making. For instance, employees who are less close-minded (or higher on 
openness) tend to be less prone toward selective perception or the confirmation 
bias, as they are more receptive to contradictory information.138 Furthermore, 
extroversion has been linked to riskier behavior among CEOs, with these executives 
being more likely to pursue acquisitions of other firms and engage in behaviors that 
pose a threat to their equity.139 Specific facets of conscientiousness—particularly 
achievement-striving and dutifulness—may affect escalation of commitment.140
First, achievement-oriented people hate to fail, so they escalate their commitment, 
hoping to forestall failure. Dutiful people, however, are more inclined to do 
what they see as best for the organization, so they are less likely to escalate their 
commitment. Second, achievement-striving individuals appear more susceptible to 
hindsight bias, perhaps because they have a need to justify their actions.141
Gender Identity Does gender influence decision making? Most research supports 
the gender similarities hypothesis in which there are little to no differences between 
genders on psychological variables. Even when differences are found, we must 
resist the urge to think of them categorically. For instance, even though some 
research has found that young women score higher than men on self-control, 
their distributions exhibit substantial overlap and disappear after age eleven.142
That having been said, there are a handful of gender differences in decision mak￾ing. For one, research suggests that men are more prone to sensation seeking and

M06_ROBB0025_19_GE_C06.indd 219 13/12/22 2:40 AM220 PART 2 The Individual
risk taking than women to a non-trivial degree.143 Research during the COVID-19 
pandemic suggests that women are more likely to engage in preventive health 
practices (e.g., social distancing, handwashing, mask-wearing). Further, using GPS 
data collected from 15 million smartphones at the onset of the pandemic, these 
researchers found that a greater percentage of women exhibited greater social 
distancing.144 Although there is less research on gender differences in decision￾making biases in workplace settings, one meta-analysis based on dozens of studies 
and thousands of people found that men tend, to a moderate degree, to make 
employment decisions that are gender-role biased for positions that are stereotyp￾ically masculine.145 Women, on the other hand, did not experience the same bias.
Intellectual Abilities We know people with higher levels of general mental 
ability (GMA; see the chapter on personality and individual differences) can 
process information more quickly, solve problems more accurately, and learn 
faster,146 so you might expect them to be less susceptible to common decision 
errors. However, GMA appears to help people avoid only some of them.147
Smart people are just as likely to fall prey, probably because being smart does 
not alert you to the possibility that you are too confident or emotionally defen￾sive. It is not that intelligence is irrelevant. For instance, research on a particular 
intellectual ability, cognitive flexibility (i.e., the ability to select the appropriate 
decision-making strategy to match the problem), suggests that it can lead to bet￾ter decisions for both ill-defined and well-structured problems.148
Cultural Differences The cultural background of a decision maker can signifi￾cantly influence the selection of problems, the depth of analysis, the impor￾tance placed on logic and rationality, and whether organizational decisions 
should be made by a leader or collectively as a group.149 Cultures differ in 
time orientation, the value they place on rationality, their belief in the ability 
of people to solve problems, and their preference for collective decision mak￾ing. While the overt rationality of the decision-making processes is valued in 
North America, this is not necessarily true elsewhere. For example, research 
on Swedish and German teams found that the Swedish generally took longer 
to make decisions than the German teams did, which was attributed to the 
consensus-orientation of the Swedish teams’ members. German teams preferred 
a more formal decision-making style based on clear roles. Other researchers 
found that Turkish employees expect senior managers to make decisions, but 
they like their opinion to be asked, a preference shaped by cultural power dis￾tance; in Japan, on the other hand, team decision-making tends to emphasize 
consensus-orientation.150
Organizational Constraints
Organizations can constrain decision makers, creating deviations from the rational 
model. For instance, managers make decisions that are influenced by the organiza￾tion’s performance evaluation and reward systems, comply with formal regulations 
and company precedents, and meet organizationally imposed time constraints.
Performance Evaluation Systems Managers are influenced by the criteria on 
which they are evaluated. If a division manager, who oversees a group of manu￾facturing plants, believes they are operating best when there is no negative feed￾back from staff or auditors, the plant managers will spend a good part of their 
time ensuring that negative information does not reach the division manager.
M06_ROBB0025_19_GE_C06.indd 220 13/12/22 2:40 AMPerception and Individual Decision Making CHAPTER 6 221
Reward Systems The organization’s reward systems influence decision makers by 
suggesting which choices have better personal payoffs. If a significant percent￾age of an employee’s pay is based on incentives and an organization sets goals 
for employees that are too unrealistic, there is a greater risk of dysfunctional and 
unethical behaviors. For example, Wells Fargo’s151 aggressive incentives program 
led employees to open two million fake accounts to earn higher incentive payouts.
Formal Regulations A shift manager at a Taco Bell restaurant in San Antonio, 
Texas, describes constraints faced on the job: “I’ve got rules and regulations 
covering almost every decision I make—from how to make a burrito to how 
often I need to clean the restrooms. My job doesn’t come with much freedom 
of choice.” The manager’s situation is not unique. All but the smallest organiza￾tions create rules and policies to program decisions and get individuals to act 
in the intended manner. In doing so, they limit decision choices—but they also 
structure the decision-making process to reduce bias. For instance, research has 
shown that CEO succession planning processes results in a greater quality and 
quantity of a candidate pool for hiring a replacement CEO.152
Time Constraints Almost all important decisions come with explicit deadlines. 
For example, a report on new-product development may have to be ready for 
executive committee review by the first of the month. Such conditions often 
make it difficult, if not impossible, for managers to gather all information before 
making a final choice, thus harming decision performance.153
Historical Precedents Decisions are not made in a vacuum; they have context. 
Individual decisions are points in a stream of choices; those made in the past are 
like ghosts that haunt and constrain current choices. It is common knowledge that 
the largest determinant of the size of any given year’s budget is last year’s budget. 
Choices made today are largely a result of choices made over the years. For instance, 
even the changing nature of school curriculum can impact strategic choice. For 
instance, research on CEOs who ran more than six hundred large corporations

between 1985 and 2015 found that those who graduated with their MBA before 
1970 were more likely to pursue diversification strategies, whereas those graduating 
after 1970 were less likely to do so, reflecting differences in typical MBA curricula.154
Decision Making in Times of Crisis During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, 
employees and leaders of businesses alike were forced to make extremely dif￾ficult decisions amid chaos, confusion, and uncertainty.155 For instance, one 
senior analyst at Forrester reflected that COVID-19 resulted in unprecedented 
uncertainty coupled with rapidly incoming information--a combination that 
left people without a template for what to do and without the luxury of time 
to thoughtfully consider how to respond.156 Decision makers are particularly 
susceptible to biases and distortion during times of crisis. For example, expert 
credit-rating agencies are more likely to provide negative or pessimistic rat￾ings of creditworthiness during times of crisis, even when the creditworthiness 
of these target people or organizations would not be affected by the crisis.157
Furthermore, decisions made during times of crisis are more likely to be emo￾tionally charged and intuitive.158 Not only does the strain of the crisis add an 
additional layer of anxiety and negative emotions to typical decisions, but the 
decisions in and of themselves may become highly charged, such as how doc￾tors and nurses had to make extremely tough decisions as to who would receive 
treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.159 Relatedly, justice and ethics in 
decision making (see the following section for more discussion) play a huge 
role in times of crisis. Indeed, perceptions of justice are incredibly important 
during times of crisis, influencing employee attitudes and customer reactions 
alike.160 Consumers are always watching, and they are vigilant of the actions 
companies take. As a result, the values of these companies are apparent through 
their actions. Therefore, leaders should look to their employees and customers 
for insight and direction when making decisions during crises.161
Ethics in Decision Making
As discussed in the prior section, ethical considerations should be important to 
organizational decision making, but not just during times of crisis. In this sec￾tion, we present three ways to frame ethical decisions and address the important 
issue of how lying affects decision making.
Three Ethical Decision Criteria
The first ethical yardstick is utilitarianism, which proposes making decisions 
solely based on their outcomes, ideally to provide the greatest good for all.162
This view dominates business decision making and is consistent with goals such 
as rationality, efficiency, productivity, and high profits.163 Keep in mind that util￾itarianism is not always as objective as it sounds. One study indicated that the 
ethicality of utilitarianism is influenced in ways we do not realize. Participants 
were given a moral dilemma: The weight of five people bends a footbridge so 
it is low to some train tracks. A train is about to hit the bridge. The choice is to 
let all five people perish or push the one heavy person off the bridge to save 
four people. In the United States, South Korea, France, and Israel, 20 percent 
of respondents chose to push the person off the bridge; in Spain, 18 percent 
chose to do so; and in Korea, none did. These might speak to cultural utilitar￾ian values, but a minor change, asking people to answer in a non-native lan￾guage they knew, caused more participants to push the person overboard: In 
one group, 33 percent pushed the person, and in another group, 44 percent 
6-6 Contrast the three ethical 
decision criteria.
utilitarianism An ethical perspective in 
which decisions are made to provide the 
greatest good for all.
M06_ROBB0025_19_GE_C06.indd 222 13/12/22 2:40 AMPerception and Individual Decision Making CHAPTER 6 223
did.164 The emotional distance of answering in a non-native language seemed 
to foster a utilitarian viewpoint.165 It appears that even our view of what we con￾sider pragmatic is changeable.
Another ethical criterion is to make decisions consistent with fundamental 
liberties and privileges, as set forth in documents such as the U.S. Bill of Rights. 
An emphasis on rights in decision making means respecting and protecting the 
basic rights of individuals, such as the right to privacy, free speech, and due pro￾cess.166 This criterion protects whistleblowers167 when they reveal an organiza￾tion’s unethical practices to the press or government agencies, using their right 
to free speech.
A third criterion is to impose and enforce rules fairly and impartially to 
ensure justice or an equitable distribution of benefits and costs.168 This crite￾rion is often approached from a deonance standpoint (employees feel as if they 
ought to behave in a certain way, as laid out in rules, laws, norms, or moral prin￾ciples).169 For example, some employees might feel as if they should not steal 
from their workplace because it is ethically “wrong” by moral norms, princi￾ples, or standards or it is forbidden by rules or laws. Notably, this “ought force” 
is present regardless of whether organizational rules exist; often, a decision is 
regarded as unfair or unjust because it violates a moral norm or principle.
Choosing Between Criteria
Decision makers, particularly in for-profit organizations, feel comfortable with 
utilitarianism. The “best interests” of the organization and its stockholders 
can justify a lot of questionable actions, such as large layoffs. However, while 
raising prices, selling products with questionable effects on consumer health, 
closing inefficient plants, laying off large numbers of employees, and moving 
production overseas to cut costs can be justified in utilitarian terms, there may 
no longer be a single measure by which good decisions are judged. This pres￾ents a challenge because satisfying individual rights and social justice creates far 
more ambiguities than utilitarian effects on efficiency and profits. Indeed, the 
ethical decision-making process itself is complex, and the traditional perspec￾tive of viewing these criteria as completely separate is giving way to one that 
views them as interrelated and contingent upon whether decisions are made 
about the self or judging others’ behavior.170
This is where CSR comes in to effect a positive change. As we can see by 
looking at utilitarian ideals, organizations may approach decisions in a certain 
way when they are looking only at a balance sheet. However, public pressure on 
organizations to behave responsibly has meant that sustainability issues clearly 
affect the bottom line: Consumers increasingly choose to purchase goods and 
services from organizations with effective CSR initiatives, high performers are 
attracted to work at CSR organizations, governments offer incentives to organi￾zations for sustainability efforts, and so forth.171
Behavioral Ethics
Increasingly, researchers are turning to behavioral ethics—an area of study that 
analyzes why people behave the way they do when confronted with ethical dilem￾mas.172 While ethical standards exist collectively in societies and organizations, as 
well as individually in the form of personal ethics, we do not always follow ethical 
standards promoted by our organizations. Sometimes we even violate our own 
standards. Our ethical behavior varies widely from one situation to the next. 
Simply put, behavioral ethics is the study of why good people can still do bad things.

a difference between the two.174 Business ethics primarily focuses on the how and 
what questions. Questions relevant to business ethics include “How can we man￾age ethical behavior?” and “What are the outcomes of injustice in the workplace?” 
On the other hand, behavioral ethics primarily concerns the why questions, such 
as “What are the psychological processes that inform (un)ethical behavior?” 
Behavioral ethics operates at multiple levels, concerning individuals, groups, and 
organizations, similar to our overarching model of OB introduced in the first chap￾ter. At the individual level, behavioral ethics focuses on ethically relevant personality 
traits and individual differences along with cognitive, affective, and identity-relevant 
processes. At the group level, we are concerned with the phenomena of (un)ethi￾cal leadership, including the influence of power, corruption, and collective action 
among followers. At the organization level, we are interested in the ethical infra￾structure (e.g., the policies and structures that lead to unethical behavior, such as 
botched coercive reward systems), environmental pressures (e.g., failing industries 
during the COVID-19 pandemic), and, finally, ethical climates and cultures.
Beyond the organizational level, behavioral ethics research stresses the 
importance of culture to ethical decision making. There are few global stan￾dards for ethical decision making,175 as contrasts between cultures illustrate. 
What is ethical in one culture may be unethical in another. For example, 
because bribery is more common in countries such as China, a Canadian work￾ing in China may face a dilemma: Should I pay a bribe to secure business if it is 
an accepted part of that country’s culture? Although some companies explicitly 
address this issue, many do not. Without sensitivity to cultural differences as 
part of the definition of ethical conduct, organizations may encourage unethi￾cal conduct without even knowing it.
Lying
Although lying might depend on both situational characteristics and individual 
differences, a large volume of research suggests that lying and dishonest behav￾ior are very common.176 Perhaps one of the reasons we lie is that lying is difficult 
for others to detect.177 In more than two hundred studies, individuals correctly 
identified people who were lying only 47 percent of the time, which is less than 
what we would expect if they randomly picked people.178
One lie detection technique is to study a person’s body language, but 
researchers found that the probability of detecting lying based solely on 
body language was also less than a random guess. Psychologist Maria Hartwig 
observed, “The common-sense notion that liars betray themselves through body 
language appears to be little more than a cultural fiction.”179 For example, one 
technique used by police officers is based on the theory that people look up and 
to the right when they lie. Unfortunately, researchers who tested the technique 
could not substantiate the underlying theory.180 Still another technique is to 
study facial expressions. Here again, many researchers could not support the 
technique with evidence.
Although people often try to justify lying as necessary in certain situations 
(e.g., job interviews or sales contexts) or because honesty can be difficult,181
lying is deadly to decision making. Managers—and employees—simply can￾not make good decisions when facts are misrepresented and people give false 
motives for their behaviors. Lying is a big ethical problem as well. From an orga￾nizational perspective, using fancy lie-detection techniques and entrapping liars 
when possible yield unreliable results.182 The most lasting solution comes from 
OB, which studies ways to prevent lying by working with our natural propensi￾ties to create environments that are not conducive to lying.

 Creativity, Creative Decision Making, 
and Innovation in Organizations 
 Although alternatives to solving problems may often be clear or readily avail￾able, sometimes a decision maker also needs creativity , the ability to produce 
novel and useful ideas. Novel ideas are different from what has been done 
before but are appropriate for the problem. 
 Creativity allows the decision maker to appraise and understand problems 
fully, including seeing problems others cannot see. Although all aspects of OB 
are complex, this is especially true for creativity. To simplify, Exhibit 6- 5 provides 
a three-stage model of creativity in organizations. The core of the model is cre￾ative behavior , which has both causes (predictors of creative behavior) and effects
(outcomes of creative behavior).

 An Ethical Choice 
 Are We as Ethical as We Think We Are? 
I
n the past ten years, corporate scan￾dals seem to be frequent features in 
the news cycle. These scandals are 
often large-scale ethical violations, like 
Wells Fargo employees opening millions 
of unauthorized bank accounts to meet 
their sales goals. It is often not until 
significant offenses like this occur that 
organizations call for reforms, which 
primarily target extensive and con￾spicuous criminal offenses. Generally, 
everyday unethical behaviors are over￾looked. Many studies, however, have 
detailed the pervasiveness of unethical 
practices like slightly altering business 
expenditure reports, stealing office sup￾plies, and conflicts of interest. Although 
these behaviors may seem trivial, they 
can create undesirable norms and 
impair trust within an organization if they 
are frequent enough. If left uncontrolled, 
minor violations can eventually esca￾late, becoming much more severe and 
with far more significant consequences. 
 Research in behavioral ethics sug￾gests that a large population segment, 
as high as more than 50  percent, 
engages in unethical behavior. These 
people do not necessarily act with mali￾cious intent. Instead, these individuals 
have “blind spots,” meaning they often 
do not understand that their behavior is 
unethical and may have negative con￾sequences. There are also certain situ￾ations in which unethical behavior is 
more likely to occur: Norms about how 
people should behave are ambiguous, 
the victim is often not directly visible, 
and performance goals are unrealistic 
(as was the case at Wells Fargo). When 
these conditions are ripe, employees 
are more prone to committing ethical 
violations. Research from behavioral 
ethics offers some recommendations 
for organizations to prevent this type of 
behavior: 
1. Focus on raising individuals’ aware￾ness of behaviors that are unethical 
and illegal. In situations where em￾ployees are not aware of the unethi￾cality, focusing on awareness and 
clarification can help curb unethical 
behavior before it happens. Training 
employees in ethical leadership, 
awareness of ethical issues, and 
restraining biases that may promote 
unethical behavior may help. 
2. Communicate to employees that 
there will be consequences for 
misconduct. Formal consequences 
are necessary when employees 
have deliberately engaged in unethi￾cal behavior and are fully aware that 
it is harmful. 
3. Encourage employees to speak 
up when they observe behavior or 
practices that might be unethical. 
Actively encourage whistleblow￾ing by creating channels whereby 
people can bring to light potential 
instances of unethical behavior, 
processes to establish the claims’ 
veracity, and the removal of barriers 
to whistleblowing (e.g., retaliation). 
4. Create formal and informal systems 
through which everyday unethical 
behavior can be detected, moni￾tored, and prevented. Formally, this 
includes hiring practices, onboard￾ing programs, continuous training, 
performance management systems, 
decision-making processes, and ac￾countability structures. Informally, 
this involves crafting an ethical cul￾ture by establishing role models for 
employees to look up to and norms, 
rituals, and language that provide 
ethical guidance to employees. 183

Creative Behavior
Creative behavior occurs in four steps, each of which leads to the next:184
1. Problem formulation. Any act of creativity begins with a problem that the be￾havior is designed to solve. Thus, problem formulation is the stage of creative 
behavior in which we identify a problem or opportunity that requires a solu￾tion that is yet unknown. For example, Marshall Carbee and John Bennett 
founded Eco Safety Products after discovering that even paints declared safe 
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emitted hazardous chemi￾cal compounds. Thus, Eco’s development of artist-safe soy-based paint began 
with identifying a safety problem with paints currently on the market.185
2. Information gathering. Given a problem, the solution is rarely clear at the 
outset. We need time to learn more and process what we have learned. Thus, 
information gathering is the stage of creative behavior when knowledge is 
sought and possible solutions to a problem incubate. Information gathering 
leads us to identifying innovation opportunities.186 Niklas Laninge of Hoa’s 
Tool Shop, a Stockholm-based company that helps organizations become 
more innovative, argues that creative information gathering means think￾ing beyond usual routines and comfort zones. For example, have lunch with 
someone outside your field to discuss the problem. “It’s so easy, and you’re 
forced to speak about your business and the things that you want to ac￾complish in new terms. You can’t use buzzwords because people don’t know 
what you mean,” Laninge says.187
3. Idea generation. Idea generation is the process in which we develop possible 
solutions to a problem from relevant information and knowledge. Curiosity 
has been found to be a driver of idea generation: When you are curious about 
something, you are more likely to link earlier ideas or earlier solutions to help 
solve the current problem.188 Idea generation has implications for group dy￾namics. For example, when NASA engineers developed the idea for landing 
a spacecraft on Mars, they did so collaboratively. Before coming up with the 
Curiosity—an SUV-sized rover that lands on Mars from a sky crane—the team 
spent three days scribbling potential ideas on whiteboards.189 Research shows 
that individual success during idea generation may lead one’s coworkers to 
evaluate and select that individual as a leader, especially if no one else is com￾ing up with good ideas.190 However, collaborative efforts during idea genera￾tion can be a “double-edged sword” for team members, as they can involve 
higher coordination costs and sharing credit for a successful idea.191

4. Idea evaluation. Finally, it is time to choose from the ideas we have gener￾ated. Thus, idea evaluation is the process of creative behavior in which we 
evaluate potential solutions to identify the best one. Sometimes the method 
of choosing can be innovative. When Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban 
was unhappy with the team’s uniforms, he asked fans to help design and 
choose the best uniform. Cuban said, “What’s the best way to come up with 
creative ideas? You ask for them. So we are going to crowd source the de￾sign and colors of our uniforms.”192 Generally, you want those who evaluate 
ideas to be different from those who generate them to eliminate the obvious 
biases and diffusion of responsibility. First, people often derive quite a bit 
of self-worth and identity from the ideas they come up. Any potential evalu￾ations threaten these ideas, which leads people to evaluate their own ideas 
more leniently, in what has been referred to as the ideator’s bias.
193 Second, 
although hierarchy can harm the idea generation phase (people feel less 
free to share ideas), it can be helpful during the idea evaluation phase be￾cause authority figures take charge and select the best idea out of the pool. 
(Without authority, people may be less willing to voice their opinions on 
which idea to select.)194
Causes of Creative Behavior
Having defined creative behavior, the main stage in the three-stage model, we now 
look back to the causes of creativity: creative potential and creative environment.
Creative Potential Is there such a thing as a creative personality? Indeed. 
While creative genius is rare—whether in science (Neil deGrasse Tyson), the 
arts (Camae Ayewa [Moor Mother]), or business (Daymond John)—most peo￾ple have some of the characteristics shared by exceptionally creative people. 
The more of these characteristics we have, the higher our creative potential. 
Consider these indicators of creative potential:
1. Intelligence and creativity. Intelligence is related to creativity—some research 
has even shown that some degree of intelligence is necessary in order to be 
creative.195 Smart people are more creative because they are better at solving 
complex problems.196 However, they may also be more creative because they 
have greater “working memory”; that is, they can recall more information re￾lated to the task at hand.197 Along the same lines, research indicates that an 
individual’s high need for cognition (desire to learn) and cognitive abilities 
geared toward updating information is correlated with greater creativity.198
2. Personality and creativity. The Big Five personality trait of openness to ex￾perience (see the chapter on personality and individual differences) cor￾relates with creativity, probably because open individuals are less conformist 
in action and more divergent in thinking. Other traits of creative people 
include proactive personality, self-confidence, risk taking, tolerance for am￾biguity, and perseverance.199 Hope, self-efficacy (belief in your capabilities), 
and positive affect also predict an individual’s creativity.200
3. Expertise and creativity. Expertise is the foundation for all creative work. For 
example, film writer, producer, and director Quentin Tarantino spent his 
youth working in a video rental store, where he built up an encyclopedic 
knowledge of movies. The potential for creativity is enhanced when individ￾uals have abilities, knowledge, proficiencies, and similar expertise to their 
field of endeavor. The expertise of others is important, too. People with 
larger social networks have greater exposure to diverse ideas and informal 
access to the expertise and resources of others.201
idea evaluation The process of creative 
behavior involving the evaluation of potential 
solutions to problems to identify the best 
one.
M06_ROBB0025_19_GE_C06.indd 227 13/12/22 2:40 AM228 PART 2 The Individual
4. Ethics and creativity. Although creativity is linked to many desirable individual 
characteristics, its relationship with ethicality is unclear. Research has demon￾strated that people who cheat may be more creative than those who behave 
ethically. It may be that dishonesty and creativity can both stem from a rule￾breaking desire.202 Some recent research has found that people who tend to 
have creative personalities (or who are members of more creative teams) tend 
to be imaginative concerning moral issues (e.g., able to better envision conse￾quences of their actions) and, as such, are actually more ethical.203
Creative Environment Most of us have creative potential we can learn to apply, 
but as important as creative potential is, by itself it is not enough. We need to 
be in an environment where creative potential can be realized.204 Perhaps most 
important is motivation. Intrinsic motivation, or the desire to work on some￾thing because it is interesting, exciting, satisfying, and challenging (discussed 
in more detail in the chapters on motivation), correlates strongly with creative 
outcomes.205 As such, environments should foster employees’ motivations to be 
creative.206 What other environmental factors affect whether creative potential 
translates into creative behaviors?
First, it is valuable to work in an environment that rewards and recognizes 
creative work.207 A study of health care teams found that team creativity trans￾lated into innovation only when the climate actively supported innovation.208
The organization should foster the free flow of ideas, including providing fair 
and constructive judgment. Freedom from excessive rules encourages creativity; 
employees should have the freedom to decide what work is to be done and how 
to do it. One study revealed that both structural empowerment (in which the 
structure of the work unit allows sufficient employee freedom) and psychologi￾cal empowerment (which lets the individual feel personally enabled to decide) 
were related to employee creativity.209 However, other research found that cre￾ating a competitive climate where achievement is valued at any cost stymies 
creativity.210
Second, certain job characteristics can foster creativity. Specifically, jobs that 
are complex, autonomous, and have clear role expectations for innovation 
are related to innovative behavior—these job characteristics can be especially 
important in inspiring creative behavior.211 Managers and leaders play a large 
role in establishing these characteristics as a part of the organizational infra￾structure and culture. They may be able to heighten innovation when resources 
are limited by encouraging employees to find resources for their novel ideas 
and by giving direct attention to appropriate tools when resources are plen￾tiful.212 Managers also serve an important role in encouraging employees to 
share knowledge and information with one another. When managers link teams 
to additional information and resources, radical creativity (introducing creative 
ideas that break the status quo) is more likely.213 The weaker ties between team 
members and manager networks may have more impact on creativity than the 
direct, stronger ties that team members have with their own networks because 
the weaker sources provide more divergent thinking.214
As we will learn in the chapter on teams, more work today is being done 
in teams, and many people believe diversity will increase team creativity. Past 
research has suggested that the effect of team diversity depends on which type of 
diversity we are talking about (surface versus deep-level diversity; see the chapter 
on diversity). Although surface-level diversity is unrelated to team creativity, deep￾level diversity is related to higher levels of team creativity, especially when tasks are 
interdependent and team members are collocated.215 Leadership might make the 
difference. Meta-analyses of the effect of leadership on both team and follower 
M06_ROBB0025_19_GE_C06.indd 228 13/12/22 2:40 AMPerception and Individual Decision Making CHAPTER 6 229
creativity suggest that transformational and empowering leadership (see the 
chapter on leadership) are positively related to creativity.216 These leaders 
enhance follower empowerment, leader–member exchange, trust, knowledge 
sharing, and motivation to be creative and establish climates for creativity.217
What is the role of culture? Although a recent nation-level study suggests that 
countries scoring high on Hofstede’s culture dimension of individuality (see the 
chapter on diversity) are more creative,218 later work suggested that it is more the 
collection of cultural characteristics that influences creativity, such as collective moti￾vational and skill-based, creativity-relevant competencies present in the culture.219
Creative Outcomes (Innovation)
The final stage in our model of creativity is the outcome. Creative behavior does 
not always produce innovation, or a creative outcome. An employee might gen￾erate a creative idea and never share it. Management might reject a creative 
solution. Teams might squelch creative behaviors by isolating those who pro￾pose different ideas. Many people may have a bias against accepting creative 
ideas because ideas create uncertainty. When people feel uncertain, their ability 
to see any idea as creative is blocked.
We can define innovations as ideas or solutions judged to be novel and useful by 
relevant stakeholders. Novelty itself does not generate an innovative outcome if it 
is not useful. Thus, “off-the-wall” solutions are innovative only if they help solve the 
problem. The usefulness of the solution might be self-evident (the function of an 
iPad), or it might be considered successful only by the stakeholders initially.220
An organization may harvest many creative ideas from its employees and call 
itself innovative. However, as one expert stated, “Ideas are useless unless used.” 
Soft skills help translate ideas into results. One researcher found that, in a large 
agribusiness company, creative ideas were most likely to be implemented when 
an individual was motivated to translate the idea into practice—and had strong 
networking ability.221 Furthermore, data from more than one hundred studies 
conducted in forty-two countries suggests that family-owned businesses are bet￾ter equipped to translate creative ideas into useful innovations, likely due to the 
strong relational ties between members.222 These studies highlight an impor￾tant fact: Creative ideas do not implement themselves; translating them into 
innovative outcomes is a social process that requires utilizing other concepts 
addressed in this text, including power and politics, leadership, and motivation.
Summary
A great deal of what goes on around us is attributable to differences in the deci￾sions we make and how we perceive things in the working world. People make 
sense of other people, groups, things, events, ideas, and so on—and the orga￾nizational or team contexts affect these sensemaking processes. Furthermore, 
we make sense of what happens and make attributions regarding which forces 
are responsible for people’s circumstances and behavior. These processes are 
wrought with many errors and biases in our perception. Why? Because the 
world is so complex, our minds need to take shortcuts to make sense of what 
goes on around us efficiently. Unfortunately, these errors and biases trickle into 
many human resources (HR) processes relevant to OB, such as performance ap￾praisal, promotion decisions, recruitment, and selection. HR processes become 
infused with error and bias because our perception is inextricably linked to our 
understanding of work problems and our decisions to solve those problems. 
M06_ROBB0025_19_GE_C06.indd 229 13/12/22 2:40 AM230 PART 2 The Individual
Although we often assume that we are making decisions rationally, the truth is 
that forces beyond our control often bound our rationality. Instead, we often 
rely on our intuition, or gut feelings, when making decisions. Armed with an 
understanding of perception and decision making, students of OB can enter 
the work world with knowledge of what it takes to make ethical decisions and 
foster innovation in organizations.
Implications for Managers
● Behavior follows perception. To influence behavior at work, assess how 
people perceive their work, understand how the environment affects their 
perceptions, and examine how you perceive other people. Often behav￾iors we find puzzling can be explained by understanding the initiating 
perceptions.
● When judging others’ (e.g., clients, coworkers) behavior, be wary of jump￾ing to conclusions about why they behave the way they do (or why certain 
things happen to them). Recognize that your perception of what causes 
their behavior, such as internal or external forces, can cause you to come 
to flawed conclusions about them.
● Make better decisions in recruitment, selection, and performance ap￾praisal by recognizing perceptual errors, heuristics, and biases in decision 
making. Learning about these problems does not always prevent us from 
making mistakes, but it does help. You can also leverage technology as an 
aid to reduce perceptual errors.
● Adjust your decision-making approach by recognizing constraints on your 
decision making and understanding whether some other factor might be 
affecting your perception at the moment. For instance, your personality 
traits and other individual differences, as well as the organizational con￾text, may be influencing how you see the problem.
● Be flexible in your approach to solving problems. Know the situations 
in which rational analysis is preferable and which situations may require 
quick, intuitive decisions. Understand that forces beyond our control 
bound our rationality. It is our responsibility to navigate the problem 
space to select the right strategy given the problem.
● Use a common language of consequences, responsibilities, duties, and 
rights when considering ethical dilemmas you may face. Ask yourself ques￾tions about whether your behavior would result in the greatest good for 
the greatest number of people or infringes upon others’ rights or if you 
have a responsibility or duty to behave in a certain way.
● Try to enhance your creative process and foster an environment where 
creativity is encouraged. To solve a problem creatively, formulate the 
problem, gather information on it, generate ideas on how to solve the 
problem, and evaluate those ideas. Try to remove work and organizational 
barriers that might impede creativity, and nurture an atmosphere that re￾wards creativity and innovation. Consider employees’ and coworkers’ cre￾ative potential when delegating creative tasks.
M06_ROBB0025_19_GE_C06.indd 230 13/12/22 2:40 AMPerception and Individual Decision Making CHAPTER 6 231
 Implicit Assessment 
POINT 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, some decisions are made 
intuitively—they are made nonconsciously, quickly, and emo￾tionally in the moment. So isn’t it likely that we may be acting 
prejudicially toward others without even realizing it? 
 Project Implicit, an initiative at Harvard started by Tony Greenwald, 
Mahzarin Banaji, and Brian Nosek, sought to uncover hidden biases 
that are outside our conscious awareness. Much of this research has 
used the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which successfully enabled 
researchers to examine how quickly people make prejudicial associa￾tions (e.g., Black and negative or White and positive) versus nonpreju￾dicial associations (e.g., Black and positive or White and negative). 
The differences between decision speeds (in milliseconds) for these 
two associations provides an estimate of one’s prejudice or bias. 
 The IAT has been very helpful in furthering research on noncon￾scious decision making and prejudice, suggesting that “milliseconds 
matter” in understanding nonconscious, intuitive behavior. On average, 
data from millions of people participating in Project Implicit research 
over the course of decades has revealed potential subconscious bi￾ases in a number of domains, including age, religion, gender identity, 
and race, among other areas. 
 The IAT has helped us understand that people prefer women over 
men and mothers over fathers implicitly, but as soon as women are 
judged within a “male” domain, the preferences shift: People tend to 
prefer male authority figures and leaders over female ones. A 2009 
meta-analysis of nearly 15,000 people found that the IAT was mod￾erately related to predicting future prejudiced judgments, behaviors, 
and physiological indices. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 Although intuition certainly plays a role in decision making, can 
a test actually tell us whether we are prejudiced? Is the num￾ber of milliseconds it takes to select an association between 
two concepts enough to tell someone that they are biased? This link 
between the IAT and biased behavior has long been questioned by 
scholars, notably Hart Blanton. 
 Beyond the ethical implications of using a test to label some￾one as prejudiced or biased, which Emily Bazelon of The New York 
Times has likened to taking our societal discussions of bias and 
changing them “from a psychological observation to a political ac￾cusation,” Blanton notes that there are many issues with the measure 
itself: “The IAT isn’t even predicting the IAT two weeks later . . . how can 
a test predict behavior if it can’t even predict itself?” One study has 
also determined that it is impossible to separate true variability in 
the IAT versus variability due to faking (when people are instructed to 
fake the IAT). 
 In an updated meta-analysis published in 2015, Blanton and 
colleagues found that the IAT does very little to predict behavior, 
perceptions, policy preferences, nonverbal behaviors, and response 
times (although sometimes small effects can have societally large ef￾fects); the only element that the IAT seemed to predict moderately 
well was brain activity of some kind. Blanton has also sparked debate 
by reanalyzing data from influential IAT tests from the earlier 2000s 
and found that some of the findings were smaller than anticipated 
and have changed substantially because of outliers and other factors 
(although this was debated by the original authors). 223

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
Our perception is our first window into the world—it gives 
us a sense of the world around us, with whom we are inter￾acting, where we are, and what we should or should not 
be doing. These perceptions are instrumental in guiding 
our decision making. In the world of business, the prevail￾ing assumption is that we make decisions rationally. How￾ever, additional research counters this assumption because 
perceptions and biases impose a limit on decision quality. 
Becoming aware of your own biases and decision-making 
errors can help you make more informed decisions and, 
in turn, make you more employable. This understanding 
can help you improve not only your ethical decision mak￾ing but also your creative performance. In this chapter, 
you developed your critical thinking, creativity, and self￾management skills by examining the role of attributions in 
CSR, challenging the assumption that all stereotypes are 
negative, uncovering how our personality influences our 
propensity to behave (un)ethically, and examining the fea￾sibility of measuring prejudicial intuitions. In the section 
that follows, you will continue to develop these skills, along 
with your communication and collaboration skills, by col￾laboratively solving a problem with classmates, confronting 
cheating as a decision, and evaluating the perils of collabo￾ration overload in organizations.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Bringing Life to a Food Desert
Imagine you and your partner are leaders in a community 
commonly referred to as a “food desert.” A food desert 
is an area where it is difficult to find and afford quality, 
fresh food. Instead, the most accessible food is unhealthy, 
fast food. Your goal is to develop a creative solution to this 
problem facing your community using the four steps of 
creative behavior:
• Problem formulation. Explicitly identify a problem for 
which a solution is currently unknown.
• Information gathering. Research the problem to assist 
in developing solutions.
• Idea generation. Develop possible solutions to the 
problem based on the context, information, and 
knowledge of the problem.
• Idea evaluation. Choose from the ideas generated by 
evaluating the solutions to determine which one is best.

ETHICAL DILEMMA Max’s Burgers: The Dollar Value of Ethics
Max’s Burgers is an emerging American fast-food chain 
with franchised outlets across the globe. When Nassar 
Group, a well-diversified conglomerate operating in 
Dubai, bought the rights to manage Max’s Burgers’ net￾work of franchised outlets in Dubai, the move was a per￾sonal project of Houssam Nassar, the Group’s managing 
director and a businessman with an excellent reputation.
Dubai’s fast-food market is overwhelmed with fran￾chised restaurants. Meat quality at Max’s Burgers, however, 
was lower than the standards set by franchisors. This was 
all about to change, because Nassar did not intend to jeop￾ardize his reputation and image. Accordingly, as the new 
operator of Max’s Burgers outlets, he issued a directive 
instructing the warehouse manager to decline any frozen 
meat shipment that did not comply with the franchisor’s 
set standards.
A few weeks after Nassar Group took over the man￾agement of Max’s Burgers, a frozen meat shipment was 
delivered to the Max’s Burgers main warehouse. Upon 
measuring the temperature of the meat, the warehouse 
manager found that it was a few degrees outside accept￾able limits. In terms of governmental regulations, a couple 
of degrees’ difference in temperature would present no 
risk to customers’ health; however, such a difference could 
have a minor effect on the taste and texture of the meat.
Prior to the change of management, and for many 
years before, the warehouse manager had had no second 
thoughts about accepting such a shipment: no food poi￾soning claim was ever filed against Max’s Burgers, and 
taste inconsistencies never bothered anyone enough to 
complain. Further, the company supplying the meat to 
Max’s Burgers was owned by a relative of the warehouse 
manager.
With the new directive in place, however, the warehouse 
manager was unsure about his decision. Even though he 
knew that Nassar would have no way of finding out that the 
received meat was noncompliant, he wasn’t sure about his 
decision this time around.224

CASE INCIDENT Warning: Collaboration Overload
“Regardless of what you’re giving us, we’re dying by e-mail,” 
an executive told Jamie McLellan, a CTO at an advertising 
agency. McLellan invested in many different collaboration 
tools with the goal of helping the employees work more 
efficiently. Many organizations have taken this same ap￾proach through open-plan offices, such as those in many 
knowledge-intensive companies like Facebook, which has 
a notorious 430,000-square-foot open office space. Among 
these tools, employees can use them to create internal 
team websites, chat, and share documents. However, al￾most everyone tended to stick to what they knew and were 
used to using: e-mail, with the employees sending and re￾ceiving between 3,000 to 5,000 e-mails per month.
This influx of various collaboration mechanisms has 
led to a real problem for organizations: collaboration 
overload. According to data spanning two decades, em￾ployees spend about 50 percent or more of their time col￾laborating with others. Although this may seem beneficial 
on the surface, this pattern has many drawbacks that are 
not readily apparent. For one, nearly 20 to 35 percent of 
collaborations that actually add value come from only 3 
to 5 percent of employees. Unfortunately, people become 
known for their capabilities and willingness to help, and 
thus the scope of their positions increases in a phenome￾non known as escalating citizenship. Another major prob￾lem with collaboration overload is that time and energy 
spent collaborating with others (rather than working on 
one’s work) translates to depleted personal resources.
Collaboration overload can have drastic effects on 
decision making within organizations. By increasing the 
number of collaboration tools and therefore increas￾ing communication complexity, the number of people 
involved in decision making increases exponentially, re￾quiring more meetings, e-mails, and instant messages. 
Although there is much evidence that suggests we may 
need to tone down the richness, variety, and depth of our 
communication due to how little “deep” work can get 
done, there seems to be an escalation of commitment to 
the cult of collaboration, with not many offices agreeing 
to become at least partially unplugged.

employees to use multiple collaboration mecha￾nisms or become employed in open-office envi￾ronments) compare to the three ethical decision 
criteria (i.e., utilitarianism, liberties/rights, and 
deonance) discussed in this chapter?225

 ENGAGING EMPLOYEES AT SALESFORCE 
Eighty-five percent of employees worldwide are actively disengaged or 
not engaged in their jobs. How do some companies maintain high job 
engagement levels while most other organizations struggle so much to 
do so? Salesforce is one such organization, included on Fortune’s “100 
Best Companies to Work For” list for the twelfth year in a row. Part of 
Salesforce’s high workforce engagement levels may stem from its unique 
company culture and employee benefits. Salesforce differentiates itself 
from other organizations with exceptionally generous paid time off and leave 
policies, including fantastic child care assistance perks, commuter benefits, 
and career development (i.e., Salesforce will reimburse 100 percent of all 
college costs up to a limit for job-related courses). 
 The founders of Salesforce were intentional about developing a company 
culture that would directly foster job engagement and motivation. As a result, 
they prioritize employee well-being through dedicated mindfulness zones in 
offices and a Wellness Reimbursement Program. Employees receive $100 
each month to use toward their well-being in whichever way they please, 
from enrolling in fitness classes to seeking nutrition counseling. Beyond 
offering innovative perks, Salesforce can also sustain high job engagement 
by continuously monitoring engagement levels. All Salesforce employees 
complete engagement surveys twice a year, but Salesforce does not withhold 
employees’ data. Employees are able to access the data from these 
surveys through a company app. The company is very transparent about 
its assessment practices. Through data sharing, employees are encouraged 
to take responsibility for the work environment and take a proactive role in 
shaping the culture.

The company also takes a somewhat unconventional approach by 
providing the same amount of transparency to its managers. All employees 
can access the data on their manager’s engagement levels and team 
performance. The goal is not to publicly discredit the managers and their 
teams but rather to determine which management practices are working 
and which ones are not. This transparency helps the organization transform 
abstract strategies that encourage engagement and motivation into 
specific behaviors and policies. For example, explicitly recognizing that 
work-life balance prevents burnout is not enough. Companies need to help 
employees find this balance through their benefits, policies, practices, and 
management.
Salesforce offers training for teams exhibiting low engagement levels, 
including “Fearless Teaming,” which focuses on cultivating “psychological 
safety” or an environment in which people feel comfortable taking risks. 
Jody Kohner, senior vice president of employee engagement at Salesforce, 
suggests that employees are empowered to do their best work when 
they feel comfortable taking risks. Employees and managers are also 
empowered to maximize the fit between employees and their teams. For 
instance, Salesforce launched an internal mobility program that empowers 
employees to switch teams if they do not feel like they fit with their current 
team. The organization’s investment in these initiatives has paid off as it 
can retain employees for longer and continue to be a successful, profitable 
company.1
Motivation is a powerful force. It can drive employees through encouragement 
and reward to accomplish challenging goals. However, it can also prompt 
employees to cheat when they experience injustice or are threatened by 
unattainable goals. Navigating and predicting these forces becomes a challenge 
to both workers and managers. Despite the challenges, knowing more about 
motivation theories can help increase an understanding of how motivation may 
operate and how employees become motivated.
Millions of people each year spend money in the hopes that they will become 
more “motivated.” In the United States alone, self-improvement and motiva￾tional services is an $11 billion market that is expected to grow 5.1 percent on 
average until 2027.2 Motivation is also one of the most frequently researched 
topics in organizational behavior (OB),3 and full-time OB practitioners (e.g., 
industrial-organizational psychologists, management consultants, human 
resource professionals) list it as one of the top most-needed areas for continued 
research in the field.4 Beyond interest in the topic, people do appear to be gen￾erally unmotivated at least for a part of the workweek. In one survey, 69 percent 
of workers reported wasting time at work every day, and nearly a quarter said 
they waste between thirty and sixty minutes each day. How? Usually by surfing 
the Internet (checking the news and visiting social network sites) and chatting 
with coworkers.5 Although times change, the problem of motivating a workforce 
stays the same.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 236 13/12/22 2:43 AMMotivation Concepts CHAPTER 7 237
 In this chapter, we will review the basics of motivation, assess motivation the￾ories, and provide an integrative model that fits these theories together. In the 
next chapter, we will apply what we know about motivation to solve motivation 
problems in the workplace. 
 Motivation Defined 
 The same student who struggles to dedicate time to read an assigned book for 
class may devour a New York Times best seller in a day. The difference lies in 
levels of motivation. 
 We define motivation as the processes that account for an individual’s 
intensity, direction , and persistence of effort toward attaining a goal. 6 While general 
motivation is concerned with effort toward any goal, we will narrow the focus to 
organizational goals. Levels of motivation can vary from moment to moment and 
can also be meaningful individual differences (see the chapter on personality 
and individual differences) . In other words, motivation can take form as both a 
personality trait and a temporary state. 
Intensity describes how hard a person tries. This is the element most of us 
focus on when we talk about motivation. However, high intensity is unlikely to 
lead to favorable job performance outcomes unless the effort is channeled in 
a direction that benefits the organization. Effort directed toward and consistent 
with the organization’s goals is the kind of effort organizations should be seek￾ing to improve. Finally, motivation has a persistence dimension. This measures 
how long a person can maintain effort. Motivated individuals work intensely on 
an appropriate task long enough to achieve their goals. 
 Many classic and contemporary theories of motivation focus on employee 
needs as goals to attain and describe whether their organizations, jobs, and work 
fulfill those needs. Other theories portray goals as means toward organizational 
ends, such as the fulfillment of job duties and responsibilities. Although we discuss 
remote work to a greater extent in the next chapter on motivation applications, 
the issues facing remote workers reflect both perspectives. As shown in the OB Poll,

remote workers’ biggest struggles include the difficulty of fulfilling people’s need 
to interact with other people as well as obstacles that thwart goal attainment, like 
household distractions and time zone differences. In the next section, we describe 
more classic theories of motivation, which portray motivation as a process involv￾ing people’s psychological needs and the extent to which work meets or neglects 
those needs.
Classic Theories of Motivation
Three theories of employee motivation formulated during the 1950s are con￾sidered to be classics in the study of motivation. They represent a foundation 
of motivation theory, with many practicing managers still using their terminol￾ogy. However, now they are of questionable validity (as we will discuss), and as 
evidence-based OB practitioners, we should carefully and cautiously consider 
their use when compared with more contemporary theories, discussed later in 
this chapter.
Hierarchy of Needs Theory
The best-known theory of motivation is Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,7
which hypothesizes that within every human being there is a hierarchy of five 
needs humans are motivated to meet. A sixth need has been proposed for a 
highest level—intrinsic values—which is said to have originated from Maslow, 
but it has not gained widespread acceptance.8 The original five needs are:
1. Physiological. Hunger, thirst, shelter, and other bodily needs.
2. Safety. Security and protection from physical and emotional harm.
3. Social-belongingness (originally love). Affection, love, belongingness, ac￾ceptance, and friendship.
4. Esteem. Internal factors such as self-respect, autonomy, and achievement as 
well as external factors such as status, recognition, and attention.
5. Self-actualization. Drive to become what we can become; includes growth, 
achieving our potential, and self-fulfillment.
According to many interpretations of Maslow’s work,9 as each need becomes 
well satisfied, the next one becomes dominant. This has led to the popularized 
depiction of the hierarchy as a pyramid or a ladder. Maslow himself, however, 
merely outlined the need categories and suggested that some may take prece￾dence depending upon the situation.10 We depict the hierarchy as a pyramid in 
Exhibit 7-1 because this is its best-known presentation, but it is important to rec￾ognize that Maslow did not depict the hierarchy of needs in this way. Maslow’s 
theory has broadly received long-standing recognition, particularly among prac￾ticing managers. Perhaps the broad recognition is because it is intuitively logical 
and easy to understand, especially in its ladder or pyramid form. Unfortunately, 
however, most research does not support its validity, and it has not been fre￾quently researched since the 1960s.11 Nonetheless, it is thus important to be 
aware of the prevailing public acceptance of the hierarchy when discussing 
motivation but also to recognize that psychological needs paint an incomplete 
portrait of motivation in the workplace.
Two-Factor Theory
Believing an individual’s relationship to work is basic and that the attitude 
toward work can determine success or failure, psychologist Frederick Herzberg 
wondered, “What do people want from their jobs?” He asked people to describe, 
in detail, situations in which they felt exceptionally good or bad about their jobs.

theories of motivation.

The responses differed significantly and led Hertzberg to his two-factor theory
(also called motivation-hygiene theory, but this term is not used much today).12
Two-factor theory is inherently tied to job satisfaction (see the chapter on job
attitudes) and expresses motivation in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
that impact job satisfaction.
Under two-factor theory, the factors that lead to job satisfaction are separate 
and distinct from those that lead to job dissatisfaction. As shown in Exhibit 7-2, 
intrinsic factors such as advancement, recognition, responsibility, and achieve￾ment seem related to job satisfaction. Respondents who felt good about their 
work tended to attribute these factors to their situations, while dissatisfied 
respondents tended to cite extrinsic factors, such as supervision, pay, company 
policies, and work conditions.

intrinsic factors to job satisfaction

To Herzberg, the data suggest that the opposite of satisfaction is not dissat￾isfaction, as was traditionally believed (see Exhibit 7-3). Removing dissatisfying 
characteristics from a job does not necessarily make the job satisfying; manag￾ers would be placating rather than motivating employees. Herzberg proposed 
a dual continuum: The opposite of “satisfaction” is “no satisfaction,” and the 
opposite of “dissatisfaction” is “no dissatisfaction.”
Conditions such as quality of supervision, pay, company policies, physical 
work conditions, relationships with others, and job security are hygiene factors. 
When they are adequate, people will not be dissatisfied; neither will they be 
satisfied. If we want to motivate people on their jobs, we should emphasize fac￾tors associated with the work itself or with outcomes directly derived from it, 
such as promotional opportunities, personal growth opportunities, recogni￾tion, responsibility, and achievement. These are the characteristics people find 
intrinsically rewarding.
The two-factor theory has not been well supported in research. Criticisms 
center on Herzberg’s original methodology and his assumptions, such as 
how the participants may be biased in thinking back to times when they felt 
good or bad about their jobs.13 Furthermore, if hygiene and motivational fac￾tors are equally important to a person, both should be capable of motivating. 
Regardless of the criticisms, Herzberg’s theory has been quite influential and 
has been used in many studies.14 Most managers worldwide are familiar with its 
recommendations.
McClelland’s Theory of Needs
Imagine that you are a sales manager in a well-known mountaineer outfitting 
company, reviewing the bonus memo you received earlier in the day. If you meet 
the easier, level 1 sales goal, you will get a $2,000 bonus. If you meet the level 
2 sales goal (which only 80 percent of the people who attempt actually attain), 
you will get a $4,000 bonus. Level 3 pays $8,000, but only half the people who try 
can attain it. Finally, Level 4 pays $32,000, but it is almost impossible to achieve. 
Which would you try for? If you selected level 3, you are likely a high achiever.
McClelland’s theory of needs, unlike Maslow’s hierarchy, suggests that needs 
are more like motivating factors than prerequisites for survival.15 In McClelland 
and colleagues’ theory, there are three primary needs:
• Need for achievement (nAch) is the need to excel or achieve to a set of 
standards.
hygiene factors Factors—such as company 
policy and administration, supervision, and 
salary—that, when adequate in a job, placate 
workers and limit job dissatisfaction.
McClelland’s theory of needs A theory that 
achievement, power, and affiliation are three 
important needs that help explain motivation.
need for achievement (nAch) The need to 
excel or achieve to a set of standards.

• Need for power (nPow) is the need to make others behave in a way they 
would not have otherwise.
• Need for affiliation (nAff) is the need to establish friendly and close inter￾personal relationships.
McClelland and subsequent researchers focused most of their attention 
on nAch.16 In general, high achievers perform best when they perceive their 
probability of success as 0.5—that is, a fifty-fifty chance. Similarly, they dislike 
low odds (high probability of success) because then there is no challenge 
to their skills. Based on prior nAch research, we can predict some relation￾ships between nAch and job performance. First, when employees have a high 
level of nAch, they tend to exhibit more positive moods and be more inter￾ested in the task at hand.17 Second, employees high on nAch tend to perform 
very well in high-stakes conditions on the job, like work walkthroughs or sales 
encounters.18
The other needs within the theory have also been empirically supported. 
First, the nPow concept has research support, but it may be more familiar to 
people in broad terms than in relation to the original definition.19 We will dis￾cuss power much more in the chapter on power and politics. Second, the nAff 
concept is also well established and accepted in research—for example, one 
study of 145 teams suggests that groups composed of employees with a high 
nAff tend to perform the best, exhibit the most open communication, and 
experience the least amount of conflict (compared with the other needs).20
Additional research suggests that our individual differences (discussed in the 
chapter on personality and individual differences) may affect whether we can 
satisfy these needs. For example, a high degree of neuroticism can prevent 
one from fulfilling the nAff, whereas agreeableness supports fulfillment of this 
need; interestingly, extroversion had no significant effect.21 Furthermore, some 
evidence suggests that women may be more likely to have more nAff needs then 
men.22
The degree to which we have each of the three needs is difficult to mea￾sure, and therefore the theory is difficult to put into practice. A behavior may 
be directed at satisfying many different needs, and many different behaviors 
may be directed at satisfying one given need, making needs difficult to isolate 
and examine.23 Therefore, the concepts are helpful, but they are not often used 
objectively.
Contemporary Theories: A Primer
Although these three classic theories are quite common, they do not represent 
the universe of influential motivation theories in management. In fact, a num￾ber of distinct motivation theories have made a substantial contribution, help￾ing illuminate the nature of motivation in organizations. Some of these theories 
may also be considered “classics” (e.g., behaviorism, expectancy theory), while 
others may be relatively more modern. Regardless, these theories share the fact 
that they are still the focus of (mostly supportive) research and practice in OB 
to this day, which makes them “contemporary” theories in our view. These “con￾temporary theories” represent the latest thinking in explaining employee moti￾vation. This does not mean they are unquestionably right, however.
To help categorize these motivation theories, it might be helpful to break 
down the core components of these theories. Researchers, for instance, have 
classified motivation theories into three categories: (a) content, (b), context, and 
(c) processes.24 The content category is primarily concerned with fundamental 
motives and individual differences in motivation states common to all people. 
This category includes self-determination theory, regulatory-focus theory, and 
job engagement theory. The context category involves sources of motivation that 
need for power (nPow) The need to make 
others behave in a way in which they would 
not have behaved otherwise.
need for affiliation (nAff) The need to 
establish friendly and close interpersonal 
relationships.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 241 13/12/22 2:43 AM242 PART 2 The Individual
stem from the contexts people find themselves in. For instance, the theories of 
reinforcement, behaviorism, and social learning (which some would also con￾sider to be classics) would fit in here. Next, the process category involves the 
direct motivation theories that focus on the process of choosing and striving 
toward goals. This includes expectancy, goal-setting, and self-efficacy theories. 
Although some may correctly suggest that justice and organizational justice 
are fundamental motives and would fit into the “content” category, given their 
importance to ethics in organizations, we close our discussion of motivation the￾ories by devoting an entire section to them.
Contemporary Theories of Motivation: 
Content-Based
Self-Determination Theory
Think of what led you to choose your college major. Did you feel like you had a 
choice in the matter? Did you feel free to explore and choose a major that was 
right for you? Were others pressuring you to choose a major? Did you feel like 
you had the support of your parents, friends, and teachers? These questions are 
all relevant to a self-determination theory (SDT) perspective on motivation.25
Self-determination theory (SDT) proposes that employees’ well-being and 
performance are influenced by the nature of their motivation for certain job 
activities.26 For instance, a sense of choice over what they do, how motivating 
the task is in and of itself, how rewards influence motivation, and how work sat￾isfies psychological needs are all fundamental components of SDT. The theory 
is actually a meta-theory (or a collection of related theories behind a common 
theme) and is widely used in psychology, management, education, and medical 
research. A key tenant of SDT is that motivation can be either autonomous (e.g., 
freely chosen) or controlled (e.g., as a result of others’ pressure or direction). 
Supporting SDT, data from approximately 40,000 schoolteachers showed that 
autonomous motivation had pronounced effects on teacher well-being, stress, 
and teaching quality.27
Cognitive Evaluation Theory “It’s strange,” said Jordan. “I started work at the 
Humane Society as a volunteer. I put in fifteen hours a week helping people 
adopt pets. I loved coming to work. But then, three months ago, they hired me 
full-time at $11 an hour. I am doing the same work I did before. But I’m not 
finding it as much fun.” Does Jordan’s reaction seem counterintuitive?
One explanation can be found in cognitive evaluation theory (CET), a 
sub-theory that suggests that extrinsic rewards (e.g., pay) reduce people’s intrin￾sic interest in a task.28 When people are paid for work, it feels less like some￾thing they want to do and more like something they must do. For example, if a 
computer programmer values writing code out of a love for solving problems, 
a bonus for writing a certain number of lines of code every day could feel coer￾cive, and the programmer’s intrinsic motivation could suffer.
CET suggests that some caution in the use of extrinsic rewards to motivate is 
wise and that pursuing goals from intrinsic motives (such as a strong interest in 
the work itself) is better for sustaining motivation. Similarly, CET suggests that 
providing extrinsic incentives may, in many cases, undermine intrinsic motiva￾tion. In support, research confirms that intrinsic motivation contributes to the 
quality of work, while incentives contribute to the quantity of work. The effects 
of intrinsic motivation may be weaker when incentives are directly tied to per￾formance (such as a monetary bonus for each call made in a call center).29

Self-Concordance Theory Another aspect of self-determination theory is self￾concordance theory , which considers how strongly people’s reasons for pur￾suing goals are consistent with their interests and core values. 30 People who 
pursue work goals that align with their interests and values are more satisfied 
with their jobs, feel they fit into their organizations better, and may perform 
better. 31 Across cultures, if individuals pursue goals because of intrinsic interest, 
they are more likely to attain goals, are happier when they do so, and are happy 
even if they are unable to attain them. 32 Why? Because they feel like they are 
more competent at accomplishing the goal and feel like they fit better with their 
organization. When people do not enjoy their work for intrinsic reasons, those 
who work because they feel obligated to do so can still perform acceptably, 
though they experience higher levels of strain. 33 On the other hand, even gig 
workers who work short-term contracts (defined explicitly by rewards) are likely 
to be motivated if their psychological needs, values, and interests are met by 
their job. 34 Self-concordance has recently been extended toward research on 
social responsibility. If your interests in sustainability align with your organiza￾tion’s, you may be more likely to engage in more socially responsible behaviors. 35

 Myth or Science? Work Has to Be Purposeful to Be Motivating 
 Describing the impact employ￾ees’ work has on the world has 
become a familiar strategy that 
organizations use to inspire employ￾ees. For example, Amazon tells employ￾ees they are building the future, and 
Microsoft describes how employees 
empower individuals and organizations 
around the world to achieve more. The 
belief is that if workers view their job 
as purposeful, organizations can avert 
demotivation. 
 However, only a small percentage 
of employees worldwide, regardless of 
the company they belong to, appear 
to be motivated and engaged. While 
employees who find work meaning￾ful experience significantly higher job 
satisfaction, a fixation on purpose 
could have unintended consequences. 
Although workplaces from IKEA to 
Microsoft promise meaningful work with 
a greater purpose, employees’ tasks 
may be routine and disconnected from 
the inspirational purpose organizations 
are promising. One survey of seven 
hundred employees across twenty-two 
industries demonstrates this discon￾nect. In this study, all but one employee 
were able to very quickly identify a triv￾ial or meaningless task that they were 
required to do regularly for their job. 
In other words, most employees seem 
to recognize that their jobs have some 
tasks that seem mundane or trivial. 
When their supposed impact and the 
reality do not match up, employees are 
more likely to reflect on their work’s lack 
of impact than their actual impact. The 
result is lower levels of meaning, enjoy￾ment, and motivation. 
 However, just because some jobs 
require employees to do more of these 
routine tasks does not mean these 
employees have to be any less motivated 
or engaged. One promising intervention 
is “superordinate framing.” Employees 
can use this framing tool to think about 
how seemingly unimportant tasks work 
to achieve a greater purpose. If organi￾zations invest in helping employees find 
meaning and purpose in even the most 
mundane tasks, the payoff could be 
considerable. Such an intervention may 
make employees less likely to quit their 
jobs, more satisfied with their work, and 
potentially more productive. 36 
Basic Psychological Needs Similar to Maslow’s and McClelland’s theories, dis￾cussed in the prior section, SDT also suggests that there are several basic psycho￾logical needs that affect work motivation. When they are satisfied, we tend to be 
more motivated; when they are frustrated, we tend to be less motivated. Need for 
relatedness is very similar to nAff, discussed in the prior section. However, need 
for autonomy and need for competence are two newer needs that correspond 
with the need to feel in control and autonomous at work and the need to feel 
like we are good at what we do and proud of it. 37 SDT proposes that, in addition 
to being driven by a need for autonomy, people seek ways to achieve compe￾tence and make positive connections with others. Of all the three needs, how￾ever, the need for autonomy is the most important for attitudinal and affective 
 need for autonomy The need to feel in 
control and autonomous at work. 
 need for competence The need to feel like 
we are good at what we do or proud of it. 
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 243 13/12/22 2:43 AM244 PART 2 The Individual
outcomes, whereas the need for competence appears to be most important for 
predicting performance.38 Also, when using extrinsic rewards, need satisfaction 
matters less for performance when the rewards are directly salient and clear.39
What does all this mean? Managers need to design jobs so that they are moti￾vating, provide recognition, and support employee growth and development. 
These actions are especially critical for new employee onboarding, as many 
employees are still deciding whether the job is a good fit for them.40 Employees 
who feel autonomous and free in what they choose to do are likely to be more 
motivated by their work and committed to their employers. Furthermore, 
employees can satisfy many of these needs through helping others,41 but do not 
pressure them to help each other!42 As Walmart leadership coach Lucy Duncan 
suggests about Walmart associates, if you take the time to incorporate SDT in 
your workplace, “you will be blown away with associate satisfaction.”43
Regulatory Focus Theory
People differ in the way they regulate their thoughts and behaviors during goal 
pursuit.44 Generally, people fall into one of two categories, or regulatory foci, 
though they could belong to both. Those with a promotion focus strive for 
advancement and accomplishment and approach conditions that move them 
closer toward desired goals. Those with a prevention focus strive to fulfill duties 
and obligations and avoid conditions that pull them away from desired goals. 
People do not necessarily stick with one strategy permanently, however.45 It is 
just as accurate to think of promotion and prevention as potential motivational 
states workers experience: Sometimes they are more focused on striving for 
accomplishment, and other times they are more focused on avoiding failure. 
In general, it is best when employees’ regulatory “foci” fit with the demands 
of the environment—sometimes promotion is preferable, and sometimes pre￾vention is preferable.46 For instance, messages that fit with citizens’ regula￾tory foci helped encourage compliance of safety behaviors during COVID-19: 
Promotion-focused people responded better to “what you can do to help you 
stay healthy,” while prevention-focused people responded better to “what you 
can do to keep America safe.”47
Although you would be right in noting that both strategies are in the service 
of goal accomplishment, the way they get there is quite different. As an example, 
consider studying for an exam. You could engage in promotion-focused activi￾ties such as reading class materials, or you could engage in prevention-focused 
activities such as refraining from doing things that would get in the way of study￾ing, such as playing video games.
You may ask, “Which is the better strategy?” Well, the answer depends on 
the outcome you are striving for. A promotion (but not a prevention) focus is 
related to higher levels of task performance, citizenship behavior, and innova￾tion; a prevention (but not a promotion) focus is related to safety performance. 
Ideally, it is probably best to be both promotion- and prevention-oriented, 
depending upon the situation.48 Employees and managers should set achiev￾able goals, remove distractions, and provide structure for these individuals.49
The role of the manager is particularly important because they set the tone for 
the rest of the employees; regulatory focus is contagious and can “trickle down” 
through the ranks.50 Furthermore, research suggests that if an individuals’ focus 
matches their supervisor’s, they will report higher relationship quality, be more 
committed to the relationship, and engage in more organizational citizenship 
behaviors (OCBs) directed at their supervisor to maintain the relationship.51
Job Engagement Theory
When Addison reports to work as a hospital nurse, it seems that everything else 
melts away. Addison becomes completely absorbed in the job: All emotions, 
promotion focus A self-regulation strategy 
that involves striving for goals through 
advancement and accomplishment.
prevention focus A self-regulation strategy 
that involves striving for goals by fulfilling 
duties and obligations and avoiding failure.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 244 13/12/22 2:43 AMMotivation Concepts CHAPTER 7 245
thoughts, and behavior are all directed toward patient care. In fact, Addison 
can get caught up in work to the point of not even being aware of the time. As a 
result of this state, Addison is more effective in providing patient care and feels 
uplifted by the work.
Addison has a high level of job engagement, the investment of an employ￾ee’s physical, cognitive, and emotional energies into job performance.52 Many 
also portray job/work engagement as a motivational state characterized by vig￾orous completion of the work, dedication to the task, and complete absorp￾tion in what one is doing,53 although more research appears to support the 
“energy-investment” state referenced in this text’s definition.54 If this term 
seems familiar to you, you are correct—employee engagement was a term intro￾duced in the chapter on job attitudes. Why are we introducing it again here? 
OB scholars actually view engagement in two different ways:55 One is as a job 
attitude, a level of enthusiasm people have toward their work. The other is as a 
motivational state.
Practicing managers and scholars have become interested in facilitating job 
engagement, given that disengaged employees cost U.S. businesses up to $550 bil￾lion annually in lost productivity.56 Job engagement appears to matter for organiza￾tions and has been found to predict higher levels of task performance and citizen￾ship behavior.57 However, as described in the chapter on job attitudes, the construct 
is partially redundant with job attitudes like organizational commitment.58
What makes people more likely to be engaged in their jobs? One review of 
over 40,000 employees suggests that apart from a proactive personality, consci￾entiousness, and extroversion, one key trait predicts job engagement: employ￾ees’ tendencies to experience positive moods and emotions (e.g., positive 
affectivity; see the chapter on emotions and mood).59 Context factors also play a 
role. For example, job characteristics and access to sufficient resources to work 
effectively, person–organization value fit, and inspirational leadership all affect 
job engagement as well.60
Contemporary Theories of Motivation: 
Context-Based
The contemporary content theories of motivation are similar to the classical 
theories discussed earlier as they primarily concern the fundamental, universal 
“truths” of motivation that exist across people. They cover content like psycho￾logical needs and individual differences in people’s motivation. However, they 
are far from the only noteworthy OB theories on the subject. For instance, a 
number of other classic theories that emphasize the role of the context or envi￾ronment on motivation are still used and supported to this day.
Reinforcement Theory
Reinforcement theory argues that reinforcement conditions behavior.61
Reinforcement theory is behaviorist, meaning that it portrays behavior as caused 
by the context or environment. You need not be concerned, behaviorists would 
argue, with internal cognitive events (such as the psychological aspects of 
autonomy, regulatory focus, or job engagement or the process-based theories 
to come). Instead, what controls behavior are reinforcers—any consequences 
that, when they immediately follow responses, increase the probability that the 
behavior will be repeated. For example, when you are given a compliment for 
doing something at work, you might be more likely to do it again.
Reinforcement theory ignores the inner state of the individual and concen￾trates solely on what happens when the individual acts. Although it is not strictly

employee’s physical, cognitive, and emotional 
energies into job performance.
7-4 Understand the differences 
between the context-based 
theories of motivation: 
reinforcement theory and 
social learning theory.
reinforcement theory A theory 
suggesting that behavior is a function of its 
consequences.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 245 13/12/22 2:43 AM246 PART 2 The Individual
Social Learning Theory
Individuals can learn by being told or by observing what happens to other peo￾ple as well as through direct experience. Much of what we have learned comes 
from watching models—coworkers, supervisors, customers, and so forth. The 
view that we can learn through both observation and direct experience is called 
social learning theory.64
Social learning theory, like reinforcement theory, assumes behavior is a 
function of consequences—but it also clarifies the effects of observation and 
perception in motivation. People respond to the way they perceive and define 
consequences, not to the objective consequences themselves. As an essential 
component of social learning theory, people learn from and “model” their 
behavior from other people. More specifically, they pay attention to what oth￾ers are doing, commit and retain what they do to memory, and reproduce the 
behaviors from memory. Moreover, we are more likely to repeat behaviors in the 
future if they are also reinforced by the model (e.g., positive feedback from a 
coach or trainer).
Researchers in organizations have become particularly interested in how 
supervisors model behavior to their employees and whether the employ￾ees actually learn and apply what they observe on the job. This is especially 
social learning theory The view that we can 
learn through both observation and direct 
experience.
a motivation theory, it does provide a powerful means of analyzing what con￾trols behavior, and therefore we typically do consider reinforcement when we 
think about motivation in OB. It is also important to note that strict adherence 
to reinforcement and behaviorism is not recommended because, clearly, peo￾ple have rich psychological worlds that impact their motivations and behavior. 
However, there is a great deal of truth to be found in behaviorist approaches 
concerning the roles of reinforcement and conditioning on human behavior.
Operant Conditioning/Behaviorism and Reinforcement Operant conditioning
suggests that people learn to behave in a certain way to either get something 
they want or avoid something they do not want. Reinforcement strengthens a 
behavior and increases the likelihood it will be repeated. Operant condition￾ing was part of B. F. Skinner’s broader concept of behaviorism, which argues 
that behavior follows stimuli in a relatively unthinking manner. Skinner’s form 
of radical behaviorism rejects feelings, thoughts, and other states of mind as 
causes of behavior. In short, people learn to associate stimulus and response, 
but their conscious awareness of this association is irrelevant.62 For instance, 
a commissioned salesperson wanting to earn a sizable income finds doing so 
is contingent on generating high sales, so the salesperson sells as much as pos￾sible. Skinner demonstrated that people will likely engage in desired behaviors 
if they are positively reinforced for doing so; rewards are most effective if they 
immediately follow the desired response; and behavior that is not rewarded or is 
punished is less likely to be repeated.
Of course, the linkage can also teach individuals to engage in behaviors that 
work against the best interests of the organization. Assume your supervisor says 
that if you work overtime during the next three-week busy season, you will be com￾pensated for it at your next performance appraisal. However, when performance 
appraisal time comes, you are given no positive reinforcement for your overtime 
work. The next time your boss asks you to work overtime, what will you do? You 
will probably decline! Moreover, many of the predictions of the other theories we 
have discussed so far are at odds with reinforcement theory. Although reinforce￾ment theory would predict that rewards pretty much always reinforce behavior, 
you may recall that cognitive evaluation theory suggests that sometimes rewards 
can undermine behavior by putting a damper on intrinsic motivation.

 An Ethical Choice 
 Motivated by Big Brother 
T
echnology is a great thing. The 
Internet provides us with instant 
access to an abundance of infor￾mation, and smartphones allow us to 
stay connected with others through 
e-mail, texting, and tweeting. Yet that 
ease of connectivity has also given 
employees the sinking feeling they are 
being watched—and they are right. But 
is tracking employees ethical? 
 Some companies are using tech￾nology to track their employees’ activi￾ties, and some of this tracking is done 
in the name of science. For example, 
Bank of America Corp. wanted to learn 
whether face-to-face interaction made a 
difference to the productivity of its call 
center teams, so it asked around a hun￾dred workers to wear badges for a few 
weeks that tracked their whereabouts. 
Discovering that the most productive 
workers interacted most frequently with 
others, the company scheduled work 
breaks for groups rather than individu￾ally. This is a nice outcome, but how did 
the monitoring affect the behavior and 
motivation of the workers? 
 Other companies track employees to 
ensure that they are hard at work, which 
risks completely demotivating some. 
Accurate Biometrics, for example, uses 
computer monitoring to oversee its tele￾commuters. Says Timothy Daniels, VP 
of operations, looking at websites his 
employees have visited “enables us to 
keep a watchful eye without being overin￾vasive.” Currently, around 70 percent of 
organizations monitor their employees. 
 Practically speaking, managers may 
not want to adopt technologies that 
demotivate their employees through 
micromanagement. Perhaps more 
important, though, how can they use 
monitoring technology ethically in work￾place applications? First and foremost, 
employees should be informed that 
their activities will be tracked. Second, 
the purpose of tracking should be made 
clear to employees. Are workers being 
monitored to learn something that 
might help them and the organization 
as a whole? Or are they being monitored 
to ensure that they never slack off? 
Finally, it should be made clear which 
behaviors are inappropriate. Taking a 
legitimate work break is different from 
spending hours on a social networking 
site. These guidelines should increase 
the likelihood that monitoring programs 
are accepted and perceived to be fair. 63
true concerning leader behaviors like servant leadership (see the chapter on 
leadership) . 65 However, the way in which work is completed is also a hot topic: 
Research has demonstrated that employees are motivated to act pragmatically, 
autonomously, and even unethically if they observe their supervisors acting that 
way. 66 Furthermore, many might assume that team members would “pick up 
the slack” if their leader defaults toward doing nothing. However, this does not 
appear to be the case: Team members are less likely to fill the leadership gap in 
teams when the supervisors are not fulfilling their duties and instead “slack off” 
themselves. 67
 Contemporary Theories of Motivation: 
Process-Based 
 Expectancy Theory 
 One of the most widely accepted explanations of motivation is Victor Vroom’s 
expectancy theory . 68 Although it has critics, most evidence supports the the￾ory. 69 Expectancy theory argues that the strength of our tendency to act a cer￾tain way depends on the strength of our expectation of a given outcome and its 
attractiveness. In practical terms, employees will be motivated to exert a high 
level of effort when they believe that it will lead to a good performance appraisal, 
that a good appraisal will lead to organizational rewards such as salary increases 
and/or intrinsic rewards, and that these rewards will satisfy their personal goals. 
Therefore, the theory focuses on three relationships (see Exhibit 7- 4 ) that, in 
many ways, establish a common language to describe the motivational process: 
7- 5 Compare the process￾based theories of 
motivation: expectancy 
theory, goal-setting theory, 
and self-efficacy theory. 
 expectancy theory A theory that suggests 
that the strength of a tendency to act in a 
certain way depends on the strength of an 
expectation that the act will be followed by a 
given outcome and on the attractiveness of 
that outcome to the individual.

1. Expectancy: the effort–performance relationship. The degree to which 
the individual believes exerting a given amount of effort will lead to 
performance.
2. Instrumentality: the performance–reward relationship. The degree to which 
the individual believes performing at a particular level will lead to the at￾tainment of a desired outcome.
3. Valence: the rewards–personal goals relationship. The degree to which or￾ganizational rewards satisfy an individual’s personal goals or needs and the 
attractiveness of those potential rewards for the individual.
Expectancy theory helps explain why a lot of workers are not motivated 
on their jobs and do only the minimum necessary to get by. It can also 
explain employees’ efforts toward goal accomplishment. For example, let 
us consider a work contest. The prize? An employee of the month parking 
spot. Some may really want this; others could not care less (valence). Maybe 
if the business shares a parking lot with Trader Joe’s (and is thus frequently 
crowded), this spot would be more coveted. Next, what is the contest like?

that year. If an employee puts forth the effort to solicit donations, will they 
actually receive donations (expectancy)? Maybe people would be more 
likely to donate in one-dollar increments over $50 increments. Finally, if 
you do get several people to donate, how likely is it that you will win the 
parking spot (instrumentality)? Are there multiple parking spots up for 
grabs? Or just one that Avery wins every year (maybe Avery knows someone 
who donates a ton of money every year to this contest)? Several factors play 
into decisions to put forth effort, and expectancy theory suggests that these 
may be in part explained by valence, instrumentality, and expectancy.
Goal-Setting Theory
You have likely heard this several times: “Just do your best. That’s all anyone 
can ask.” But what does “do your best” mean? How do we ever know whether 
we have achieved that vague goal? Research on goal-setting theory, proposed 
by Edwin Locke and Gary Latham, reveals the impressive effects of goals on 
performance. Under this theory, intentions to work toward a goal are consid￾ered a major source of work motivation.70 How do goals affect performance? 
According to the theory and decades of evidence supporting it, goals do four 
things: (1) They direct attention, (2) they mobilize effort, (3) they encourage 
persistence, and (4) they facilitate the development of strategy.71
Goal Origins If employees can participate in the setting of their own goals, 
will they try harder? The evidence is mixed, although across studies it appears 
that they will not perform any better.72 In some studies, self-set goals yielded 
superior performance; in others, individuals performed best when assigned 
goals by their supervisor. If goals are not set by the employee, then the super￾visor needs to ensure that the employee clearly understands their purpose 
and importance.73 However, self-set goals do have some psychological ben￾efits: Research shows that self-set goals can lead to greater employee enthu￾siasm, whereas supervisor-set goals may lead to heightened anxiety and per￾ceptions of uncertainty and threat. Ultimately, these differences can have 
very real consequences for employee emotional exhaustion and OCBs (e.g., 
employees with supervisor-set goals may be less likely to go above and beyond 
the call of duty).74 As a final note, sometimes we do not have a choice in goal 
setting, and instead we may subconsciously “catch” goals from other people. 
It is important to be aware of the goals that we consciously set versus those we 
subconsciously adopt.75
Goal Characteristics Goal-setting theory is well supported. Evidence strongly 
suggests that specific goals increase performance and that difficult goals, when 
accepted, result in higher performance than do easy goals.76 Why? First, goals 
that are specific explicitly direct attention toward what needs to be accomplished. 
Imagine you just graduated from college—after putting your video game con￾troller down, you add “start applying to jobs” to your agenda. Although this may 
seem like a step in the right direction, it is a vague and nonspecific goal. A bet￾ter goal would be “apply to ten to fifteen jobs per week”: It specifically defines 
when and how much of the task you need to accomplish.
Second, once a difficult task has been accepted, we can expect that indi￾vidual to exert a high level of effort to try to achieve it. Think back to that job 
application goal you just set—do you think the goal was too difficult or too easy? 
Delving deeper, the way we frame these goals matters. For instance, you could 
either set a goal for the number of applications to complete each week (i.e., 
a maintenance goal), or you could set an overall goal for the entire summer, 
goal-setting theory A theory that intentions 
to work toward a goal are considered a major 
source of work motivation and lead to higher 
performance.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 249 13/12/22 2:43 AM250 PART 2 The Individual
“complete 130 job applications by the end of the summer” (i.e., an attainment
goal).77 Which one seems more difficult to you? Instead of establishing a range 
of ten to fifteen job applications, you could also set yourself either a minimal 
standard (e.g., “apply to at least ten jobs a week”) or a maximal standard (e.g., 
“apply to fifteen jobs a week ideally”). The maximal standard is clearly more 
difficult, but prior research suggests you would feel more satisfied and accom￾plished with the maximal than the minimal standard.78
Factors That Help or Hurt Goal Setting Although goal setting has a direct impact 
on performance in organizations, a number of factors can either help or hurt 
goal-setting efforts. These include (1) goal commitment, (2) task characteris￾tics, (3) feedback, (4) goal orientation, and (5) goal conflict.
Goal Commitment Goal-setting theory assumes an individual is committed to 
the goal and determined not to lower or abandon it. The individual (1) believes 
they can achieve the goal and (2) wants to achieve it.79 Goal commitment is 
most likely to occur when employees expect that their efforts will pay off in goal 
attainment, when accomplishing the goal is attractive to them, and when they 
actively participate in goal setting.80
Goal commitment does not happen in a vacuum, however. For instance, 
we often subconsciously mimic others, which can affect our goal commitment 
(e.g., see the earlier section on social learning). What if our friends who also 
graduated recently are not putting all that effort into their job search? Research 
suggests that we may be likely to mimic this underachievement.81 Similarly, what 
if you attend a party with your college friends, everyone is talking about their 
careers post-graduation, and you feel like you are being evaluated? Would that 
make you become more committed to the job search? Research suggests that 
focusing on the “goal audience” and the uneasiness about being evaluated com￾pared to your peers can affect goal commitment.82
Goal pursuit is not always “smooth sailing.” In fact, in working toward goals, 
we may often experience setbacks that affect our progress (e.g., finding out you

Bank in London in 2010 with the

and capturing 10 percent of London’s 
banking market. This challenging 
goal motivates employees to exert 
a high level of effort in giving 
customers exceptionally convenient, 
flexible, and friendly—including 
pet-friendly—service.

have been applying to jobs incorrectly by not including a cover letter) or our 
progress over time (e.g., finding out that you have to help your parents move to 
a new apartment, limiting how many applications you can fill out). These types 
of disturbances can be frustrating and cause us to lose commitment toward our 
goals and perhaps even abandon them.83 Paradoxically, goal abandonment fol￾lowing an initial failure is more likely for individuals with strong core values, 
possibly because they internalize the implications of failure more strongly than 
others do.84
Task Characteristics Goals seem to affect performance more strongly when tasks 
are simple rather than complex (although when the goal is to learn something, 
challengingly complex material can be inherently motivating).85 Also, goal set￾ting is more effective when the tasks are independent rather than interdepen￾dent.86 However, on interdependent tasks, group-centered goals that emphasize 
the person’s contribution to the dyad or group are better than goals focused on 
the person’s own performance.87 Furthermore, when people depend on one 
another and do not know each other well, goals to cooperate with one another 
can be effectively motivating.88 There may also be gender implications: Research 
suggests that expectations and stereotypes that women are more “communal” 
than men may cause women to be more sensitive to group goals in interdepen￾dent contexts.89
Feedback Feedback, in general, leads to higher performance.90 People do bet￾ter when they get feedback on how well they are progressing toward their goals 
because it helps identify discrepancies between what they have done and what 
they should do next. That is, feedback guides behavior. For example, managers 
who coach their sales employees and provide feedback can directly facilitate 
sales goal attainment.91 But all feedback is not equally potent. Self-generated 
feedback—with which employees can monitor their own progress or receive 
feedback from the task process itself—is more powerful than externally gener￾ated feedback.92 In making progress toward your career goals following gradu￾ation, it may be helpful to seek the feedback of a career counselor or mentor.93
However, many of us can recall a time when we received feedback that did not 
sit well with us, especially if we do not believe we can do much to change or feel 
like we do not have the psychological and physical resources to actually incor￾porate the feedback.94 In general, feedback is a good thing, but it is tricky—the 
usefulness of feedback depends on the person giving the feedback, the person 
receiving the feedback, the nature of the task, and the quality of the feedback 
itself.
Goal Orientations Similar to the content-based regulatory focus theory dis￾cussed earlier, goal orientation suggests that people systematically differ in 
the extent they are motivated to prove themselves through good performance 
(i.e., performance-prove) and avoiding poor performance (i.e., performance-avoid) 
and the extent to which they are motivated to master the task (i.e., mastery).95
However, like regulatory focus, goal orientations can also emerge in situations 
as motivational states,96 like how a friendly competition between departments 
in your organization can momentarily result in a performance-prove orienta￾tion. As another example, if you adopt a mastery goal orientation, you are more 
likely to be effective in accomplishing your goal of completing job applications 
than if you adopted a performance-avoid orientation.97
Considering psychological health and performance outcomes, research on 
these orientations generally suggests positive outcomes for mastery orientations, 
undesirable outcomes for performance-avoid orientations, and weak or relatively 
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 251 13/12/22 2:43 AM252 PART 2 The Individual
mixed effects for performance-prove orientations.98 Furthermore, conflicting 
goal orientations can also wreak havoc in teams working toward interdependent 
goals, with performance-avoid orientations leading to team members hiding and 
manipulating information when interacting with their teammates.99 These ori￾entations can even effect how you see your teammates as role models to look up 
to (mastery) or as people to compare yourself to (performance-prove and -avoid).100
Want to develop a mastery goal orientation? Next time you are confronted with 
a goal, take a step back to reflect on the goal and focus on what you are excited 
about learning from the situation.101
Goal Conflict We often find ourselves confronted with goals that compete with 
one another. At the executive level, for instance, executives may think they need 
to pursue profitability at the expense of safety and employee well-being (regard￾less of whether they may actually go hand in hand in reality).102 At the personal 
level, you may have two separate, time-sensitive tasks you need to complete—but 
only enough time to complete one of them. In general, hundreds of studies sug￾gest that goal conflict has a nefarious effect on employee stress and anxiety103 and 
can even linger and affect your performance on tasks that are completely unre￾lated.104 How can you manage goal conflict? First, some research suggests you can 
manage goal conflict by establishing a routine of regulation, in which you recog￾nize and accept the conflict between the goals (i.e., splicing), focus on the actions 
that can lead toward accomplishing both goals (i.e., activating), and do not let the 
actions that are impossible completely thwart progress toward either goal (i.e., 
repressing).105 Second, if the goals are split between groups with competing goals, 
inspiring collaboration between the groups and co-constructing solutions can be 
effective.106
Implementing Goal Setting How do managers set goals in their organizations? 
That is often left up to the individual manager. Some managers set aggressive 
performance targets—what General Electric called “stretch goals.” For exam￾ple, Motorola once sought to reduce how long it took to close its year-end books 
from six weeks to four days.107 Some leaders, such as the CEO of Telltale games, 
are known for their demanding performance goals—some of which even sug￾gest that game developers weather the “crunch,” a sudden spike in work hours 
that requires them to work as many as 20 hours a day.108 But many managers do 
not set goals. When asked whether their jobs had clearly defined goals, only a 
small number of respondents to a survey of managers said yes.109
A more systematic way to utilize goal setting is with management by objectives 
(MBO), an initiative most popular in the 1970s but still used today.110 MBO 
emphasizes participatively set goals that are tangible, verifiable, and measurable. 
Four ingredients are common to MBO programs: goal specificity, participation 
in decision making (including the setting of goals or objectives), an explicit 
time period, and performance feedback.111 Many elements in MBO programs 
match the propositions of goal-setting theory. As Exhibit 7-5 shows, the organi￾zation’s overall objectives are translated into specific cascading objectives for 
each level (divisional, departmental, individual). But because lower-unit manag￾ers jointly participate in setting their own goals, MBO works from the bottom 
up as well as from the top down. The result is a hierarchy that links objectives at 
one level to those at the next level.
You will find MBO programs in many organizations from different indus￾tries, and many of these have led to performance gains. A version of MBO, 
called management by objectives and results (MBOR), has been used for thirty 
years in the governments of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.112 However, the 
popularity of these programs does not mean they always work.113 When MBO 
management by objectives (MBO) A 
program that encompasses specific goals, 
participatively set, for an explicit time period, 
with feedback on goal progress.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 252 13/12/22 2:43 AMMotivation Concepts CHAPTER 7 253
fails, the culprits tend to be unrealistic expectations, lack of commitment by top 
management, and inability or unwillingness to allocate rewards based on goal 
accomplishment.
Although goal setting can, be positive, employees and managers should be 
careful not to overdo it.114 For example, goals might impede learning because 
we become too focused on achievement; we may choose the wrong type or form 
of goal which may impede performance; and we may fall prey to escalation of 
commitment (see the chapter on perception and decision making) if we are not 
careful. If you want to maximize the extent to which goal setting is successful, 
recent research suggests that setting a cadence of accountability can help and 
monitoring of goals can lead to more frequent goal attainment, especially when 
goal progress is publicly announced.115
Goal Setting and Ethics The relationship between goal setting and ethics is 
quite complex: If we emphasize the attainment of goals, what is the cost? The 
answer is probably found in the standards we set for goal achievement. For 
example, when money is tied to goal attainment, we may focus on getting the 
money, become willing to compromise ourselves ethically, and disengage from 
the ethical aspects of the situation (e.g., justify what we are doing even though 
it is unethical).116 The context also matters. Time pressure often increases as we 
are nearing a goal, which can tempt us to act unethically to achieve it.117 Goal 
setting can also lead to unethical behavior through depletion.118 For example, 
if the kitchen staff is exhausted and overloaded, they might be more prone to 
take shortcuts in food preparation and cleaning that put food safety in dan￾ger. Even personal characteristics matter. For instance, our goal orientation can 
have an influence—if we are focused more on proving our worth or avoiding 
failure rather than mastering the process, we may be more likely to engage in 
unethical behavior.119
Self-Efficacy Theory
Self-efficacy refers to an individual’s belief of being capable of performing a 
task.120 The higher your self-efficacy, the more confidence you have in your abil￾ity to succeed. For example, if you feel like your college education equipped 
self-efficacy An individual’s belief of being 
capable of performing a task.

you with the employability skills to establish a rewarding career, you may feel 
more capable of succeeding in your job search and more motivated to apply 
for jobs post-graduation.121 In contrast, in difficult situations, people with 
low self-efficacy are more likely to lessen their effort or give up altogether, 
while those with high self-efficacy will try harder to master the challenge.122
Intelligence and personality are linked to higher self-efficacy.123 People who are 
intelligent, conscientious, and emotionally stable are so much more likely to 
have high self-efficacy that some researchers argue self-efficacy is more impor￾tant than prior research suggested.124
At first glance, this may appear to be more of a content-based approach to 
motivation, as described in earlier sections. Although self-efficacy theory was 
originally formulated in this way, later research demonstrated that self-efficacy is 
integral to the process of maintaining motivation over time. As you move through 
the job search process, for instance, your perceived progress will in turn affect 
your self-efficacy perceptions and how intensively you continue to search.125 To 
deal with the ebb and flow, it would be helpful to adopt self-management and 
emotion regulation practices (see the chapter on emotion and mood).126 Self￾efficacy can (but does not always) create a positive spiral in which those with 
high efficacy become more engaged in their tasks and then in turn increase 
performance, which increases efficacy further.127 Self-efficacy may also create 
situations in which people get “cocky” and start to perform more poorly and 
become less motivated as a result.128 However, this may also be attributable to 
the idea that resources are being conserved and preserved. (You cannot per￾form well all the time or you would burn out.)129 What is perhaps important is 
that people have self-efficacy when and where it counts. For example, entrepre￾neurs who experienced more variability in self-efficacy were more successful in 
starting businesses.130 This indicates that they, at times, demonstrated humility 
and adapted to setbacks instead of getting cocky.
Increasing Self-Efficacy How can employees achieve high levels of self-efficacy? 
By bringing goal-setting theory and self-efficacy theory together. As Exhibit 7-6 
shows, supportive managers who set difficult goals for their employees may lead 
them to have a higher level of self-efficacy and set higher goals for their own 
performance.
Research also suggests that there are four ways of increasing self-efficacy: 
(1) Give employees relevant experiences with the task (i.e., enactive mastery), 
(2) enable them to watch someone else do the task (i.e., vicarious modeling), (3) 
reassure the employees, letting them know that they have “what it takes” to do 
the task (i.e., verbal persuasion), and (4) tell them to “get psyched up” (i.e., 
arousal)—getting energized will enable the employees to approach the task 
more positively (although this last step is probably not a good idea if the task is 
“low-key,” like writing a sales report). The vicarious learning aspect may seem 
familiar—indeed, this recommendation coincides with social learning theory 
described earlier. It is an especially important aspect to increasing self-efficacy, 
especially during COVID-19: Globally, health professionals had to vicariously 
learn from one another in order to adopt best practices for combating the 
pandemic.131
Training programs often make use of enactive mastery by having people 
practice and build their skills. In fact, one reason training works is that it 
increases self-efficacy, particularly when the training is interactive and feedback 
is given afterward.132 For instance, training programs can be used to help build 
the career and entrepreneurial self-efficacy of underrepresented students 
in STEM fields.133 However, some research suggests that if the employee is 
unable to see their own improvement, then they will not experience enhanced 
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 254 13/12/22 2:43 AMMotivation Concepts CHAPTER 7 255
self-efficacy.134 Regardless, individuals with higher levels of self-efficacy also 
appear to reap more benefits from training programs and are more likely to 
use their training on the job.135
The Pygmalion Effect One of the best ways for a manager to use verbal per￾suasion is through the Pygmalion effect, a term based on a Greek myth about a 
sculptor (Pygmalion) who fell in love with a statue he carved. The Pygmalion 
effect is a form of self-fulfilling prophecy in which believing something can make 
it true. Here, it is often used to describe “that what one person expects of 
another can come to serve a self-fulfilling prophecy.”136 For example, if we 
identify those in the office with the highest leadership potential, we may treat 
them in such a way where they eventually become a leader.137 However, we 
may find leaders in unexpected places, as “diamonds in the rough”—Dov 
Frohman notes, “Leaders are found in the strangest places. Often the best 
candidates turn out to be people from outside the mainstream. . . who at first 
glance one would never expect would have leadership potential.”138 The 
Pygmalion approach can be effective in the workplace, with replicable results 
and enhanced effects when leader–subordinate relationships are strong.139

Kai, a recent graduate working as a middle manager in the same finance depart￾ment. Kai makes $30 an hour and is dissatisfied.
Specifically, Kai tells Ainsley that compared to managers at other pharma￾ceutical companies, this position pays much less. “It isn’t fair. I work just as 
hard as they do, yet I don’t make as much. Maybe I should go work for the 
competition?”
How could someone making $30 an hour be less satisfied with their pay than 
someone making $20 an hour and be less motivated as a result? The answer lies 
in equity theory and, more broadly, in principles of organizational justice.140
According to equity theory, employees compare what they get from their job 
(their “outcomes,” such as pay, promotions, recognition, or a bigger office) to 
what they put into it (their “inputs,” such as effort, experience, and education). 
They take the ratio of their outcomes (O) to their inputs (I) and compare it to 
the ratio of others, usually someone similar like a coworker or someone doing 
the same job. This is shown in Exhibit 7-7. If we believe our ratio is equal to 
those with whom we compare ourselves, a state of equity exists, and we perceive 
our situation as fair. If there are “inequities,” then we perceive the situation as 
unfair.141
Based on equity theory, employees who perceive inequity will make one of 
six choices:142
1. Change inputs (exert less effort if underpaid or more if overpaid).
2. Change outcomes (individuals paid on a piece-rate basis can increase their 
pay by producing a higher quantity of units of lower quality).
3. Distort perceptions of self (“I used to think I worked at a moderate pace, 
but now I realize I work a lot harder than everyone else”).
4. Distort perceptions of others (“Aisha’s job isn’t as desirable as I thought”).
5. Choose a different referent (“I may not make as much as my sibling, but 
I am doing a lot better than they did at my age”).
6. Leave the field (quit the job).
Equity theory has support from some researchers, but not from all.143 As 
some examples, it seems that some employees are more sensitive to equity, 
with some feeling more entitled and others feeling more benevolent.144 Also, 
if someone feels like they are being overpaid on the job, would you expect 
them to give back part of their salary? Although equity theory’s propositions 
have not all held up, the hypothesis serves as an important precursor to the 
study of organizational justice or, more simply, fairness in the workplace.145
Organizational justice is concerned more broadly with how employees feel 
authorities and decision makers at work treat them. However, it is also con￾cerned with how people adhere to or violate rules and principles in the 
equity theory A theory stating that 
individuals compare their job inputs and 
outcomes with those of others and then 
respond to eliminate any inequities.

workplace.146 For instance, one could think of equity passively, with board 
members experiencing injustice when executives retain much more than their 
“fair share,” or actively if we evaluate executives’ power and opportunistic 
behavior to capture a larger portion compared with shareholders.147 Research 
over the past several decades consistently shows that justice is critically impor￾tant for maintaining the employee–organization relationship,148 especially 
during times of crisis and uncertainty.149 For the most part, employees evaluate 
how fairly they are treated, as shown in Exhibit 7-8.
Distributive Justice
Distributive justice is concerned with the fairness of the outcomes, such as 
pay and recognition, that employees receive.150 Outcomes can be allocated in 
many ways. For example, raises can be distributed equally among employees, 
or they can be based on which employees need money the most. As we said in 
our discussion about equity theory, however, employees tend to perceive their 
outcomes are fairest when they are distributed equitably. Distributive injus￾tice can also occur at a broader level—for example, the Black–White pay gap 
in the United States has been steadily getting larger from year to year and 
exists even when they share educational backgrounds and come from affluent 
families.151
The way we have described things so far, individuals appear to gauge dis￾tributive justice and equity in a rational, calculative way as they compare their 
outcome–input ratios to those of others. But the experience of justice, and espe￾cially of injustice, is often not so cold and calculated. Instead, people base dis￾tributive judgments on a feeling or an emotional reaction to the way they think

they are being treated relative to others, and their reactions are often “hot” and 
emotional rather than cool and rational.152 For example, during the 2018 U.S. 
government shutdown, one TSA employee noted that while others “get to stay 
home, enjoy their personal time with their families, and still get paid, we have to 
struggle and suffer ... most of us live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to 
be unpaid and still go to work for long. It is not fair.”153 Furthermore, the “type” 
of reward may matter: One study found that most people care more about pay 
differences, although differences in recognition and challenging assignments 
are also important.154
Procedural Justice
Although employees care a lot about what outcomes are distributed (equity the￾ory and distributive justice), they also care about how they are distributed. The 
way in which outcomes are distributed is the focus of procedural justice.155 For 
one, employees perceive that procedures are fairer when they are given a say in 
the decision-making process, when decision makers follow several rules, making 
decisions in a consistent manner (across people and over time), avoiding bias 
(not favoring one group or person over another), using accurate information, 
considering the groups or people who their decisions affect, and remaining 
open to appeals.156 As an example of procedural justice, if you are hoping for a 
raise and your manager informs you that you did not receive one, you will prob￾ably want to know how raises were determined. If it turns out your manager allo￾cated raises based on merit and you were simply outperformed by a coworker, 
then you are more likely to accept your manager’s decision than if raises were 
based on favoritism.
If the decision-making process is judged to be fair, then employees are more 
accepting of unfavorable outcomes.157 When employees are given a voice in 
the process, they will feel better about the situation even when the outcomes 
continue to be poor.158 Procedural fairness is not just thought of in terms of 
structure, either. Issues such as how long processes take matter, with certain pro￾cesses requiring more time to be fair and others requiring less time.159
Today, as we have discussed in a number of places in the text (e.g., the chap￾ter on diversity), organizations are attempting to employ artificial intelligence 
(AI)-assisted decision making to make procedures more fair and less biased.160
However, do employees actually see these new tools as fair? Some research draw￾ing on thousands of participants suggests that employees might see these tools 
as reductionist and not taking their specific situations into account. As such, 
paradoxically, a tool that is meant to improve bias (and objectively may do so) 
can be seen by employees as more biased.161
Interactional Justice
Beyond outcomes and procedures, research has shown that employees care 
about two other types of fairness that have to do with the way they are treated 
during interactions with others. Both of these fall within the category of interac￾tional justice (see Exhibit 7-8).162
Informational Justice The first type is informational justice, which reflects 
whether managers provide employees with explanations for key decisions and 
keep them informed of important organizational matters. The more detailed 
and candid managers are with employees, the more fairly treated those employ￾ees feel.
It may seem obvious that managers should be honest with their employees 
and not keep them in the dark about organizational matters; however, many

informational justice The degree to which 
employees are provided truthful explanations 
for decisions.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 258 13/12/22 2:43 AMMotivation Concepts CHAPTER 7 259
managers are hesitant to share information. This is especially the case with 
bad news, which is uncomfortable for both the manager delivering it and the 
employee receiving it. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic led many manag￾ers to be in the position where they had to lay off all or part of their workforce, 
a decision wrought with a number of justice considerations.163 Explanations 
for bad news are beneficial when they take the form of excuses after the fact 
(“I know this is bad, and I wanted to give you the office, but it wasn’t my decision”) 
rather than justifications (“I decided to give the office to Sam, but having it isn’t 
a big deal”).164 Although we frame informational justice here as flowing from 
managers to employees, managers can experience informational justice, too. 
For instance, employees who disclosed their pregnancies to their supervisors 
(thus, improving supervisor informational justice perceptions) enjoyed higher 
perceived supervisor support.165
Interpersonal Justice The second type of justice relevant to interactions 
between managers and employees is interpersonal justice, which reflects 
whether employees are treated with dignity and respect. Compared to the other 
forms of justice, interpersonal justice is unique because it can occur in everyday 
interactions between managers and employees.166 This quality allows managers 
to take advantage of (or miss out on) opportunities to make their employees 
feel fairly treated. For example, some leaders may treat some followers fairly and 
others unfairly, leading to lower interpersonal justice perceptions,167 especially 
for employees who are highly committed to their jobs and embedded in their 
organizations.168 Interpersonal injustice, like informational justice, can also 
affect managers. Unfortunately, some research suggests that even when leaders 
from underrepresented groups adhere to interpersonal justice rules, they can 
still be treated with bias in return, as stereotypes are activated concerning their 
motivations to follow the rules.169
Justice Outcomes
After all this talk about types of justice, how much does justice really matter to 
employees? A great deal, as it turns out. When employees feel fairly treated, 
they respond in many positive ways. All the types of justice discussed in this 
section have been linked to higher levels of task performance and citizenship 
behaviors such as helping coworkers, as well as lower levels of counterproduc￾tive behaviors such as shirking job duties.170 Distributive and procedural jus￾tice are more strongly associated with task performance, while informational 
and interpersonal justice are more strongly associated with citizenship behav￾ior. Even more physiological outcomes, such as how well employees sleep and 
the state of their health, have been linked to fair treatment.171 Why does jus￾tice have these positive effects? Fair treatment enhances commitment to the 
organization and makes employees feel that the organization cares about their 
well-being. In addition, employees who feel fairly treated trust their supervisors 
more, which reduces uncertainty and fear of being exploited by the organiza￾tion. Fair treatment elicits positive emotions, which in turn prompts behaviors 
like citizenship.172
Interestingly, your coworkers’ reactions to injustice can be just as important 
as your own. Research is beginning to suggest that third-party, or observer, reac￾tions to injustice can have a substantial effect. Say that you read about mas￾sive, unannounced layoffs at a restaurant chain you frequent. You find out that 
employees were let go without any warning and were not given any assistance in 
finding alternative arrangements. Would you continue to go to this restaurant? 
Research suggests that you may not.173
interpersonal justice The degree to which 
employees are treated with dignity and 
respect.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 259 13/12/22 2:43 AM260 PART 2 The Individual
Despite all attempts to enhance fairness, perceived injustices are still likely to 
occur. Fairness is often subjective; what one person sees as unfair, another may 
see as perfectly appropriate. For example, a gig worker who just sees their job as 
a stepping-stone to something bigger may not care as much about unfairness as 
other gig workers.174 In general, people see allocations or procedures favoring 
themselves as fair.175 However, if an organization is not consistent in how justly it 
treats its employees and employees feel like they are on a roller coaster of abuse 
and unfair treatment, then they are more likely to become detached, cooperate 
less, and have lower job attitudes.176
Culture and Justice
Across nations, the same basic principles of procedural justice are respected: 
Workers around the world prefer rewards based on performance and skills over 
rewards based on seniority. However, inputs and outcomes are valued differ￾ently in various cultures.177
We may think of justice differences in terms of cultural values (see the chap￾ter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations). One large-scale study 
of over 190,000 employees in thirty-two countries and regions suggested that 
justice perceptions are most important to people in countries with individualis￾tic, feminine, uncertainty avoidance, and low-power-distance values.178 Indeed, 
research demonstrates that employees react (e.g., with reduced trust or effort) 
differently to perceived injustice, like abusive supervision, in different ways 
depending upon their culture: Employees in Confucian societies that are high 
power distance tend to be less affected.
We can also look at other cultural factors. Some cultures emphasize status 
over individual achievement as a basis for allocating resources. Materialistic cul￾tures are more likely to see cash compensation and rewards as the most relevant 
outcomes of work, whereas relational cultures will see social rewards and status 
as important outcomes. International managers must consider the cultural pref￾erences of each group of employees when determining what is fair in different 
contexts.
Integrating Contemporary Theories 
of Motivation
Our job might be simpler if, after presenting a half dozen theories, we could 
say only one was valid. But many of the theories in this chapter are complemen￾tary. We now tie them together to help you understand their interrelationships. 
Exhibit 7-9 integrates much of what we know about motivation. Its foundation is 
the expectancy model that was shown in Exhibit 7-8. Let’s walk through Exhibit 
7-9. (We will look at job design more closely in the next chapter.)
We begin by explicitly recognizing that opportunities can either aid or hin￾der individual effort. The individual effort box on the left also has another arrow 
leading into it, from the person’s goals. Consistent with goal-setting theory, the 
goals–effort loop is meant to remind us that goals direct behavior.
Expectancy theory predicts employees will exert a high level of effort if they 
perceive a strong relationship between effort and performance, performance 
and reward, and rewards and satisfaction of personal goals. Each of these rela￾tionships is, in turn, influenced by other factors. For effort to lead to good 
performance, the individual must have the ability to perform and perceive the 
performance appraisal system as fair and objective. The performance–reward 
7-7 Describe how the contem￾porary theories of motivation 
complement one another.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 260 13/12/22 2:43 AMMotivation Concepts CHAPTER 7 261
relationship will be strong if the individual perceives that performance (rather 
than seniority, personal favorites, or other criteria) is rewarded. If cognitive 
evaluation theory were fully valid in the actual workplace, we would predict that 
basing rewards on performance should decrease the individual’s intrinsic moti￾vation. The final link in expectancy theory is the rewards–goals relationship. 
Motivation is high if the rewards for high performance satisfy the dominant 
needs consistent with individual goals.
A closer look at Exhibit 7-9 also reveals that the model considers achieve￾ment motivation, job design, reinforcement, and equity theories/organiza￾tional justice. A high achiever is not motivated by an organization’s assessment 
of performance or organizational rewards, hence the jump from effort to per￾sonal goals for those with a high nAch. Remember, high achievers are inter￾nally driven if their jobs provide them with personal responsibility, feedback, 
and moderate risks. They are not concerned with the effort–performance, 
performance–reward, or rewards–goal linkages.
Reinforcement theory enters the model by recognizing that the organiza￾tion’s rewards reinforce the individual’s performance. If employees see a reward 
system as “paying off” for good performance, the rewards will reinforce and 
encourage good performance. Rewards also play a key part in organizational 
justice research. Individuals judge the favorability of their outcomes (for exam￾ple, their pay) relative to what others receive but also with respect to how they 
are treated: When people are disappointed in their rewards, they are likely to be 
sensitive to the perceived fairness of the procedures used and the consideration 
given to them by their supervisors.

 Toward a Better World 
 Kroger: Zero Hunger, Zero Waste 
 Kroger, a Fortune 100 U.S. grocery 
giant, is the parent company to over 
twenty different grocer chains. Many 
Americans do their grocery shopping 
at a Kroger-owned store. Since 2018, 
many customers may have become 
aware of Kroger’s “moonshot” goals 
as a part of its “Zero Hunger, Zero 
Waste” corporate social responsibil￾ity initiative. It all started with Kroger 
associates recognizing a “fundamen￾tal absurdity” in the U.S. food supply 
chain: a staggering 40 percent of U.S.-
produced food is wasted or discarded. 
Further, one in every eight Americans 
battles hunger daily. With this problem 
in mind, Rodney McMullen (Kroger CEO) 
set forth a vision: “No family in a com￾munity we serve should ever go hun￾gry, and no food in a store we operate 
should ever go to waste.” Since then, 
Kroger has been very forthcoming in its 
practices and procedures in realizing 
this vision, even setting a target date to 
reach this goal. 
 Aligned with goal-setting theory, 
Kroger set a specific, difficult set of 
goals, applicable to all executives, 
employees, customers, and other 
stakeholders: (1) Zero hunger. (2) Zero 
waste. Although many at Kroger rec￾ognize that these goals are incredibly 
ambitious, they directly communicate 
the initiative’s objectives to every￾one, customers and employees alike. 
From these ultimate goals, Kroger 
set several sub-goals to reach these 
objectives. These sub-goals included 
establishing a multimillion-dollar grant 
fund for startups in food waste reduc￾tion, donating billions of meals, advo￾cating and promoting legislation to 
reduce food waste and alleviate hunger, 
leveraging big data and AI to identify 
where these goals can effectively be 
advanced, and forming strategic part￾nerships with other organizations who 
have this goal (along with convincing 
their current partners to adopt the goal 
as well). 
 Are these goals working? Just two 
years later, it appears that Kroger is 
undoubtedly making progress: It has 
committed over $200  million toward 
hunger alleviation, donated nearly 
500 million meals to communities, and 
identified and rescued over 100 million 
pounds of food from stores, manufac￾turing facilities, and distribution cen￾ters. Kroger has also diverted a stag￾gering 80  percent of its total waste 
from landfills and transformed 94 per￾cent of its manufacturing plants to a 
completely zero-waste model. Kroger 
has established strategic partnerships 
with major organizations like Feeding 
America and the World Wildlife Fund 
(WWF) and funded innovative startups 
like Imperfect Foods and Mobius. 
 How does Kroger inspire its employ￾ees and customers to join it toward 
these goals? For one, it starts with the 
active engagement of customers. For 
instance, Kroger became one of the 
only Fortune 100 companies to start 
its own recycling program, encourag￾ing customers to save waste materials 
that would otherwise not be recyclable 
through their local programs and mail 
them in, postage paid. As Keith Dailey, 
a vice president at Kroger, noted, “A key 
part of achieving our ambitious Zero 
Hunger, Zero Waste vision is offering our 
customers innovative solutions to recy￾cle and reuse product packaging.” What 
about the employees? Kroger does sev￾eral things to engage its associates in 
social responsibility activities, primar￾ily through training and development, 
coaching, participative leadership, and 
social media. Kroger also specifically 
uses CSR-oriented employee recogni￾tion programs, recognizing employees 
as “Zero Heroes.” These associates go 
above and beyond to help Kroger meet 
its Zero Hunger, Zero Waste goals. A 
Kroger trainer, Amber Winchester of 
Paducah, Kentucky, received this acco￾lade for brokering relationships between 
the local Kroger division and local com￾munities in need of food. Winchester 
seems to provide an excellent example 
for self-concordance in action: “It is 
important for me to work for a company 
that I can actually stand behind, a com￾pany that values the same things that 
I do . . . not letting people starve and not 
polluting the environment with more gar￾bage is definitely something that I per￾sonally stand behind . . . it is just really 
cool that Kroger has those same val￾ues.” Kroger employs evidence-based 
motivation practices to foster job 
engagement in corporate social respon￾sibility by increasing self-concordance, 
modeling employees’ behaviors, and 
granting autonomy. 179

Summary
Motivation is key to understanding employees’ contributions to their work. 
Overall, motivation underlies how and why employees exert effort to engage in 
performance activities, which meet personal or organizational goals. Motivation 
describes the processes (e.g., intensity, direction, and persistence) underlying 
how people in the workplace direct their efforts toward a goal. Although not 
well supported, many classic, foundational theories of motivation focused on 
psychological needs and the consequences of need satisfaction. Despite still 
being applied by managers in practice, these theories have fallen out of favor 
for OB theorists and researchers. On the other hand, many evidence-based, con￾temporary theories of motivation paint a more comprehensive, precise picture 
of motivation. In this chapter, we follow other researchers by arranging these 
theories into three categories: content, context, and process. Content theories 
focus on aspects of motivation that these theorists suggest are fundamental to 
the human experience (e.g., self-determination theory) or reflect individual dif￾ferences in motivation (e.g., regulatory focus and job engagement). The sec￾ond category focuses on the influence of the context on motivation, such as 
rewards (e.g., reinforcement) and role models (e.g., social learning). The third 
category, process theories, focuses on motivation as a process and how it leads 
to behavior and performance. Expectancy theory, goal setting, and self-efficacy 
characterize aspects of the motivation process that lead people to become moti￾vated and act on their motivations. Lastly, no discussion of motivation in organi￾zations would be complete without a focus on organizational justice: Concerns 
of equity, fair distribution of resources, and procedural fairness along with in￾teractional respect and dignity are essential to predicting motivation and behav￾ior in the workplace. Given the breadth of understanding of motivation in the 
workplace, we bring the theorizing together into a complementary workplace 
motivation model. This model outlines the human resource processes and in￾terventions grounded in theory that inform motivation applications described 
in the next chapter.
Implications for Managers
● Classic theories paint an incomplete picture of motivation. Consider con￾temporary theories when assessing motivation in your organization.
● People will be motivated if they feel like their actions are feely chosen and 
in alignment with their interests and values. Try to foster this autonomy 
instead of treating motivation as completely “controllable” through pres￾sure, direction, or reward.
● Despite the power of autonomy, rewards and reinforcement can still be a 
powerful force in promoting desired behaviors in organizations—but do 
not underestimate the psychological aspects of motivation. Rewards alone 
cannot fix organizational problems.
● Depending on which behaviors are desirable given the task, try to adopt 
or lead others toward a promotion focus (e.g., for innovation goals) or 
prevention focus (e.g., for safety goals).
● Job engagement is still a management “buzzword,” and there is confusion 
regarding what job engagement actually represents. However, it can help 
put motivation into practice. Apply other contemporary motivation theo￾ries to understand how employees and managers can become (and stay) 
engaged in the workplace.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 263 13/12/22 2:43 AM264 PART 2 The Individual
● Lead by example: Model and encourage others to model the types of be￾haviors you would like to see performed by employees. 
● Thinking of motivation in terms of expectancy, instrumentality, and va￾lence can help you break down many common motivation problems in 
organizations into their parts. Ask yourself whether effort leads to perfor￾mance, whether performance leads to the desired outcome, and whether 
those involved actually care about it. 
● Harness the power of goal setting: Set specific, difficult goals. Consider 
the factors that may affect goal setting. Determine whether a manage￾ment by objectives program would be suitable for your organization. 
● Self-efficacy can affect motivation and behavior throughout the moti￾vation process and is sometimes helpful and sometimes even harmful. 
Consider how self-efficacy changes throughout the goal-setting process 
and adapt accordingly. 
● When making decisions regarding resources in your organization, make 
sure to consider how the resources are being distributed (and who is af￾fected), the fairness of the decision, and whether your actions demon￾strate that you respect those involved. 
 Feel-Good Messaging Is More Motivating Than 
Instrumental Messaging 
POINT 
F
inancial incentives were once thought to be the key to moti￾vating people. However, many have challenged this view, dem￾onstrating that connecting people’s work to prosocial causes 
can motivate people in ways that a paycheck or bonus cannot. This 
“feel-good messaging” leads employees to become motivated by 
deriving meaning from what they do. As an example of the impor￾tance of meaning at work, nine out of ten people are willing to give 
up a percentage of their lifetime earnings if it means engaging in 
more meaningful work. Feeling good about work is vital for employ￾ees around the world. Seventy-seven percent of respondents across 
forty-seven countries report that a job that is useful for society is 
either essential or very important to them. Leaders can effectively 
motivate employees when they communicate to them their impact 
on the beneficiaries of their work (e.g., patients, clients, customers, 
etc.) Thus, focusing on the immediate impact of one’s work can mo￾tivate employees. When employees are inspired by the idea that their 
work may contribute to a better society (whether through protecting 
the environment, reducing poverty, or promoting social justice), they 
will be motivated. Even if the company may benefit from its prac￾tices through cost reduction, employees will be more motivated by 
understanding the impact they have on the world and enhancing their 
sense of meaningfulness than if their impact was measured as con￾tributions to the organization’s goals. For instance, would you rather 
be known for making a difference in a customer’s life by making their 
homeownership dream a reality? Or would you rather be known as 
being the number one realtor at your real estate company? 
COUNTERPOINT 
 T
he practical reasons for changing behavior may not be as ap￾pealing as the feel-good messages. Still, they convey that an 
organization has genuine motives. More companies are speak￾ing out about social issues and committing to prosocial initiatives, 
but they support them for instrumental reasons (i.e., as a means to 
an end). But not all of them follow through, leading the public and 
employees to be more critical and wary of organizations’ purportedly 
“prosocial” intentions. Some suggest that “instrumental messages” 
(e.g., we are reducing our plastic usage to limit costs ) are more 
effective than “feel-good” messages (e.g., we are reducing our plas￾tic usage to save the environment ) in motivating employees. This 
idea runs contrary to the popular idea that organizations should rely 
on feel-good messaging to motivate employees. Demonstrating the 
practical, instrumental purposes of work can be just as, if not more, 
motivating than feel-good messaging. The real issue is that employ￾ees must believe these prosocial motives are genuine. If the organiza￾tion is only committing to social initiatives for the financial benefit, 
these messages are likely to be less motivating. Encouraging leaders 
to say, “We believe in limiting costs” may be less appealing. Still, it 
is more likely to be perceived as authentic and ultimately motivate 
employees. 180

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
Motivation is a fundamental aspect of organizational be￾havior. It drives effortful work processes toward the ac￾complishment of work tasks and the realization of work 
goals. Therefore, by understanding the traditional and 
contemporary theories of motivation and how workplace 
decisions affect motivation, you can develop your manage￾ment skills and become more employable. Understand￾ing equity theory and organizational justice can help 
you understand the impact of fairness in the workplace 
and consider others’ fairness perspectives when making 
organizational decisions. In this chapter, you developed 
your critical thinking, creativity, and leadership skills by 
questioning whether work has to be purposeful to be 
motivating, debating the usefulness of electronic em￾ployee monitoring and “feel-good” messaging, and un￾derstanding how some organizations use goal setting to 
meet ambitious CSR goals. In the following section, you 
will continue to develop these skills as well as your self￾management skills by considering the best ways to moti￾vate employees in different situations; learning to recog￾nize the “folly of rewarding A while hoping for B”; and 
considering laziness in the workplace, especially how it 
can escalate and spread to others.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE How Do You Motivate an Employee?
You and a partner will take turns playing the role of a man￾ager and an employee. The following four scenarios de￾scribe various reasons why the employee is experiencing a 
lack of motivation. The manager’s task is to use whichever 
strategies they see fit to help motivate the employee.
• SCENARIO 1: You are reluctant and unmotivated to 
take on a task assigned to you. You feel that the task 
does not align with your interests and that someone 
else would be better suited to handle it.
• SCENARIO 2: You think a task that has been assigned 
to you should be handled by someone else as you 
are, frankly, overqualified. It would be a waste of your 
skill set and expertise to spend time working on 
this task.
• SCENARIO 3: You feel unmotivated and anxious about 
completing a task because you are worried you will not 
do it well. There is a tight deadline.
• SCENARIO 4: You are unmotivated to complete a task. 
You are not sure why, but you think it is because you do 
not like your fellow team members who work with you 
on the task. As a result, you have been trying to get one 
of your colleagues to complete the task instead.
After completing the role-play exercise, answer the fol￾lowing questions with your partner.
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 265 13/12/22 2:43 AMQuestions
7-8. When you were playing the employee’s role, how 
did the manager’s suggestions make you feel?
7-9. Do you believe the manager’s suggestions were ef￾fective? Why or why not?
7-10. From the employee’s perspective, do you think 
the manager could have done anything differ￾ently to improve your motivation?181
ETHICAL DILEMMA Follies of Reward
Most of the time, we have good intentions when we try to 
reward others. We might give a bonus to an employee who 
has done an exceptionally good job all year. Or our re￾ward systems might be a little more institutionalized. For 
example, a movie theater might reward an employee for 
soliciting charity donations from moviegoers, or a realtor 
might receive a commission for each house sold.
Sometimes, however, even with good intentions, we may 
be rewarding the wrong thing. In a classic article of the 
same title, Steven Kerr outlines this “Folly of Rewarding 
A, While Hoping for B.” For example, if you go to the 
doctor’s office, the doctor can make two types of errors: 
(1) pronouncing you well when you are actually sick and 
(2) pronouncing you sick when you are actually well. If 
the doctor commits the first error, the consequences are 
grave—there could be a threat of a lawsuit, malpractice, 
or negligence. If the doctor commits the second error, 
the consequences have much less of an impact—the doc￾tor generates more income, establishes a more regular 
customer base, and is rewarded by society for taking a 
“conservative” approach to diagnosis. These reward and 
punishment differences persist, even when there is the 
chance that treatment without due cause can cause more 
harm than good. However, shouldn’t society seek to mini￾mize both types of errors and instead seek medical diag￾nostic accuracy as a goal?
In a more recent example, one study found that a 
monthly perfect attendance award program across five 
industrial laundry plants did not work the way it was in￾tended to: When participants became ineligible for the 
award, they showed up less frequently. The employees 
became so focused on attendance that their efficiency 
decreased by 8  percent because many of them would 
become ineligible for the reward after coming in late or 
missing a day during the month period. The plant was re￾warding attendance and hoping for good performance.
Questions
7-11. How do you think we might be able to recognize 
when we are rewarding the wrong thing? What 
steps can organizations take to recognize these 
instances?
7-12. Is rewarding the unintended behavior or out￾come always unethical? Why or why not?
7-13. Do you think it is possible for a reward program 
to start out rewarding the appropriate behavior at 
its inception but then begin to reward the wrong 
thing over time? Why or why not?182
CASE INCIDENT Why Lead by Example?
Motivating staff is one of the most important tasks of any 
manager, and there are multiple theories that try to ex￾plain what makes employees “tick.” A common piece of 
advice that most of us will have heard is to lead by exam￾ple. But why is this important? The Motivational Theory of 
Role Modeling was developed by Thekla Morgenroth and 
Michelle Ryan at the University of Exeter in the United 
Kingdom and Kim Peters at the University of Queensland 
in Australia. In broad terms, the theory shows how role 
models can influence people’s goals and motivations in 
three ways: by acting as behavioral models, by represent￾ing what is possible, and by being inspirational. It ex￾plains how the power of role models can be harnessed to 
increase role aspirants’ motivation, reinforce their exist￾ing goals, and facilitate their adoption of new goals.
The theory draws on a combination of social learning 
theory and role modeling insights as well as expectancy￾value models of motivation to offer a useful framework that 
explains why and how role models in organizations may be 
key to motivation. First of all, role models may motivate 
employees to imitate certain behavioral patterns. Social 
learning theory states that we can learn not only through 
our own experience but also by observing other people’s 
conduct and behavior. This means that people can be mo￾tivated or demotivated by perceived consequences without 
necessarily having to experience them firsthand.
266 PART 2 The Individual
M07_ROBB0025_19_GE_C07.indd 266 13/12/22 2:43 AMMotivation Concepts CHAPTER 7 267
For instance, you may hear your manager say, “We have 
excellent new flexible work policies. All employees should 
feel free to work hours that suit them or from home when 
they want!” However, in the coming weeks, you see that your 
manager continues to come to the office at 9 a.m. and leaves 
at 5 p.m. every day; they also reward colleagues who seem to 
follow the same work pattern and show no flexibility in the 
timing of meetings. In this situation, it is very unlikely that 
you would be motivated to follow your manager’s advice to 
follow the new policies.
That’s why the “do as I say, not as I do” approach is a 
challenge for managers in terms of motivating their em￾ployees. Interestingly, both positive and negative role mod￾els can be influential, with negative role models serving to 
demonstrate behaviors that one may want to avoid. For ex￾ample, an employee who has reached a managerial position 
may treat those who report to them differently as a result of 
what they witnessed as the consequences of management’s 
poor treatment of their colleagues. That’s why leading by 
example remains important for managers of all levels. 
In addition to their behavior, role models may also 
affect broader employee motivation in terms of their as￾pirations or career goals, by acting as representations of 
what is possible and achievable as well as inspirations for 
success. The motivational influence of role models may 
also depend on the expectancy—or individuals’ perceived 
likelihood—of success as well as of value, which refers to 
the individual’s perceived desirability of such success. The 
theory suggests that the characteristics of role models, 
like levels of the role model’s success and similarity be￾tween role model and role aspirant, may affect one’s mo￾tivation and its intensity. For instance, people are more 
inspired to persist with their efforts when they observe 
someone “like them” achieve success. For example, re￾search by McGinn and colleagues found that daughters 
of mothers who work are 1.21 times more likely to be em￾ployed and 1.29 times more likely to be in supervisory and 
managerial positions, and this role modeling effect was 
only found to impact mothers and daughters, not sons. 
Similarly, studies in business and entrepreneurship find 
that exposure to female role models significantly boosts 
women’s self-efficacy and inclination to pursue careers in 
business. This partially explains why diversity of represen￾tation is so important in organizations; employees need 
different sources of motivation.183

 TEACHER MERIT PAY: IS IT THE SOLUTION? 
One of the most contentious topics related to education reform is that 
of teacher pay. There have been many teacher walkouts and strikes 
with teacher compensation as a central issue. For example, Chicago Public 
Schools, the nation’s third-largest school district, eventually approved a 
historic 16 percent pay increase in 2019 after months of failed negotiations 
with the Chicago Teachers Union and eleven days of canceled classes. 
The American public also agrees that teachers should be paid more, with 
60  percent of Americans believing school districts do not compensate 
teachers fairly. 
 In most school districts, teachers are usually paid based on the number 
of years they have been teaching and their education level. However, 
this system has been criticized as unfair because top-performing, long￾tenured, and well-educated mediocre teachers are all paid the same salary. 
Alternatives to this system involve differentiating pay through performance￾based incentives. These have all been met with considerable opposition, 
particularly from teacher union leaders. They argue that there is no objective 
definition of a “good teacher” and that these systems are biased as a result. 
Furthermore, critics of merit pay believe it is unfair to pay teachers based on 
criteria such as student achievement, arguing that there are many factors 
outside the classroom that can impact student learning, such as students’ 
health and home environment. 
 Despite opposition, teacher merit pay programs are becoming more 
popular and have obtained financial and political support. The federal 
M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 269 14/12/22 4:12 PM270 PART 2 The Individual
government has allocated more than $2 billion in more than thirty states 
to design and implement performance pay systems. The implementation of 
these programs, though, has not been without obstacles. In 2019, Denver 
teachers nearly went on strike against what was viewed by many as a promising 
merit pay system, ProComp. Although student achievement increased under 
this system, many teachers were dissatisfied with unpredictable fluctuations 
in their pay. In theory, merit pay may have the potential to improve teacher 
motivation and student achievement; however, implementing a pay-for￾performance system may be ineffective at achieving the desired results.
There is also considerable debate among education researchers about 
merit pay’s effect on teacher motivation. There is research demonstrating that 
teachers are more likely to remain in their jobs when their salary increases. 
However, an increase in base pay is the largest for less experienced 
teachers and tends to decrease with experience. Some also argue that 
merit pay systems can create competition among teachers, disincentivizing 
cooperation and collaboration among them. However, it depends on how the 
school district decides to implement the system. Suppose it is a zero-sum 
system where only the top ten teachers receive a financial incentive. In that 
case, it is more likely to create division than if all teachers could potentially 
qualify to earn up to a maximum bonus. Another version of a merit pay 
system may tie a proportion of one’s performance evaluation to effective 
group participation. The idea is that this would create a greater incentive for 
teachers to share and discuss lessons and strategies, ultimately increasing 
the effectiveness of more teachers. The research also demonstrates a 
modest but statistically significant positive effect of merit pay programs on 
student test scores. Although merit pay may have a small effect on teacher 
motivation, intrinsic motivators may have a more substantial motivational 
effect than financial incentives.
In general, it appears that the key to effective merit pay is in how the programs 
are implemented. Rewarding teams of teachers results in a larger effect than 
awarding raises based on their rank-order in performance. It also can improve 
teacher recruitment and retention, which are particular challenges for schools 
in low-income communities. Thus, merit pay programs show promise, but 
administrators must pay careful attention to how these programs are implemented. 
Regardless, merit pay represents a significant shift in how numerous schools and 
organizations as a whole have operated for many years.1
Organizations take a number of approaches toward encouraging, maintain￾ing, and harnessing manager and employee motivation. Some focus on the 
nature of the job itself and involve designing work to emphasize the characteris￾tics that are most motivating to workers or empowering workers to have a say in 
the work that they complete. On the other hand, some focus on the motivators 
M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 270 14/12/22 4:12 PMMotivation: From Concepts to Applications CHAPTER 8 271
for work, including rewards and benefits. In this chapter, we discuss the many 
ways organizations approach motivation in the workplace.
In the previous chapter, we discussed the theory behind motivation. Here, 
we discuss application. Although not all theories brought up in the prior chap￾ter are discussed here, you will come to find that major contemporary theories 
[e.g., self-determination theory (SDT)] play a large role. Of course, it is impor￾tant to understand these underlying theories; it is also important to see how 
they can be applied in the workplace, beginning with job design.
Motivating by Job Design: The Job 
Characteristics Model (JCM)
The way work is structured has a bigger impact on an individual’s motivation 
than it seems. For example, one survey of nearly three thousand working par￾ents in the UK found that 78 percent were working beyond their contracted 
hours (despite having children to care for), mainly for workload reasons or 
because it was part of the culture to work overtime. Commenting on the results, 
one manager noted that employers should “really rethink job design to tackle 
the problem of overworking. Parents need more human-sized jobs.”2
Job design suggests that the way elements in a job are organized can influ￾ence employee effort,3 and the job characteristics model discussed next can 
serve as a framework to identify opportunities for changes to those elements. 
Considering our discussions from the prior chapter, many of the concepts to be 
discussed may seem familiar to you, including autonomy (a major component 
of SDT) and feedback (a key player in the goal-setting process). The job charac￾teristics model (JCM) describes jobs in terms of five core job dimensions:4
1. Skill variety is the degree to which a job requires a variety of activities using 
different skills or talents. The work of a garage owner-operator who does 
electrical repairs, rebuilds engines, does bodywork, and interacts with cus￾tomers scores high on skill variety. The job of a body shop worker who sprays 
paint eight hours a day scores low on this dimension.
2. Task identity is the degree to which a job requires completion of a whole 
and identifiable piece of work. A cabinetmaker who designs furniture, 
selects the wood, builds the furniture, and finishes the pieces has a job that 
scores high on task identity. A job scoring low on this dimension would in￾volve operating a lathe solely to make table legs.
3. Task significance is the degree to which a job affects the lives or work of 
other people. The job of a nurse helping patients in a hospital intensive 
care unit scores high on task significance; sweeping floors in a hospital 
scores low.
4. Autonomy is the degree to which a job provides the worker freedom, in￾dependence, and discretion in scheduling work and determining the pro￾cedures for carrying it out. Sales managers who schedule their own work 
and tailor their sales approach to each customer without supervision have 
highly autonomous jobs. An account representative who is required to fol￾low a standardized sales script with potential customers has a job low on 
autonomy.
5. Feedback is the degree to which carrying out work activities generates direct 
and clear information about your own performance. A job with high feed￾back would be testing and inspecting iPads. Installing components of iPads 
as they move down an assembly line provides low feedback.

in determining the procedures to be used in 
carrying it out.

the work activities required by a job results 
in the individual obtaining direct and clear

The Job Characteristics Model
Elements of the JCM
Exhibit 8-1 presents the JCM. Note how the first three dimensions—skill vari￾ety, task identity, and task significance—combine to create meaningful work 
the employee will view as worthwhile. Jobs with high autonomy give employ￾ees a feeling of responsibility for work outcomes, and feedback shows them 
how effectively they are performing. The more these three psychological states 
(e.g., meaningfulness, responsibility, and knowledge of results) are present, the 
greater will be employees’ motivation, performance, and satisfaction, and the 
lower their absenteeism and likelihood of leaving. As Exhibit 8-1 indicates, indi￾viduals with a high growth need are more likely to experience the critical psy￾chological states when their jobs include these elements—and are more likely 
to respond to them more positively.
Efficacy of the JCM
Much evidence supports the relationship between the presence of these job char￾acteristics and higher job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and experi￾enced meaningfulness through increased motivation.5 Furthermore, although 
employees have noticed that jobs are becoming more autonomous and interde￾pendent and requiring more skills than before, the relationships with job satis￾faction have not changed since the 1970s, suggesting that employees still value 
enriched work.6 In general, research supports the JCM, although some person￾ality and context differences exist. For example, studies suggest that the link 
between job characteristics and satisfaction are highest when employees tend 
to regularly experience positive moods (i.e., trait positive affect; see the chapter 
on emotions and moods).7 Other research has explored the JCM in unique set￾tings such as in virtual work situations, finding that if individuals work together 
online but not in person, their experience of meaningfulness, responsibility, and 
knowledge of results can suffer.8 Thankfully, managers can mitigate these nega￾tive effects for employees by consciously developing personal relationships with 
them and increasing their sense of task significance, autonomy, and feedback.9

Motivating Potential Score (MPS)
We can combine the core dimensions of the JCM into a single predictive index, 
called the motivating potential score (MPS) and calculated as follows:
= + + MPS × × skill variety task identity task significance
3 autonomy feedback
To be high on motivating potential, jobs must be high on at least one of 
the three factors that lead to experienced meaningfulness and high on both 
autonomy and feedback. If jobs score high on motivating potential, the model 
predicts that motivation, performance, and satisfaction will improve and that 
absences and turnover will be reduced. Think about your job (or one you have 
had in the past). Could you work on different tasks, or was there more of a rou￾tine? Could you work independently, or did you constantly have a supervisor 
or coworker looking over your shoulder? Your answers might indicate this job’s 
motivating potential.

Job Redesign
“Every day was the same thing,” Cameron said. “Stand on that assembly line. 
Wait for an instrument panel to be moved into place. Unlock the mechanism 
and drop the panel into the Jeep Wrangler as it moved by on the line. Then 
I plugged in the harnessing wires. I repeated that for eight hours a day. I don’t care 
that they were paying me $24 an hour. It was really taking a toll on me. Finally, I 
just said this isn’t going to be the way I’m going to spend the rest of my life. My 
brain was turning to JELL-O. So I quit. Now I work in a print shop and I make 
less than $15 an hour. But let me tell you, the work I do is really interesting. The 
job changes all the time, I’m continually learning new things, and the work really 
challenges me! I look forward every morning to going to work again.”
The repetitive tasks in Cameron’s job at the Jeep plant provided little vari￾ety, autonomy, or motivation. In contrast, Cameron’s job in the print shop is 
challenging and stimulating. From an organizational perspective, the failure 
of Cameron’s first employer to redesign the job into a more satisfying one 
led to increased turnover. Redesigning jobs therefore has important practical 
implications—reduced turnover and increased job satisfaction among them.10
Furthermore, societies and organizations are looking to job design as 
one way to improve inclusiveness in organizations. Consider Mohsin Khan, a 
seventy-five-year-old aircraft repair technician—as Khan’s eyesight deteriorated, 
the company invested in an expensive laser-marker machine with a large screen 
to help emboss numbers on metal plates to assist Khan in how he does his job.11
Singapore is helping businesses assist and retain older employees through a job 
redesign grant, available since 2016.12 This grant has enabled the government 
and businesses to care for the needs of the aging population and provide a 
source of life enrichment for older workers. Let us look at other ways that jobs 
can be redesigned to motivate employees.
Job Rotation and Job Enrichment
Job Rotation If employees suffer from over-routinization of their work, one 
alternative is job rotation, or the periodic shifting of an employee from one task 
to another with similar skill requirements at the same organizational level (also 
called cross-training).13 One survey of millennial managers and professionals 
suggests that job rotation is an important aspect of modern work, with roughly 
70 percent of respondents rating it as important.14 Manufacturers also use job

employee from one task to another.

jobs can be redesigned.

rotation as needed to respond more flexibly to the volume of incoming orders 
while also reducing employee boredom and increasing employee motivation.15
It may also increase safety and reduce repetitive-based work injuries, but that is 
currently a topic of much study and debate, with mixed findings.16
New managers are sometimes rotated through jobs, too, to help them 
get a picture of a whole organization.17 For these reasons, job rotation can 
be applied in any setting where cross-training is feasible, from manufacturing 
floors to hospital wards. At Singapore Airlines, for instance, a ticket agent may 
temporarily take on the duties of a baggage handler, both to be cross-trained 
and to get exposure to different aspects of the organization. Extensive job 
rotation is among the reasons that Singapore Airlines is rated one of the best 
airlines in the world.18
Job rotation does have drawbacks. Training costs increase when each rotation 
necessitates a round of training. Second, moving a worker into a new position 
reduces overall productivity for that role. Third, job rotation creates disruptions 
when members of the work group must adjust to new employees. Fourth, super￾visors may have to spend more time answering questions and monitoring the 
work of recently rotated employees.
Job Enrichment The major focus of SDT (see the previous chapter) can be 
put into action through the process of job enrichment. In job enrichment, 
high-level responsibilities are added to the job to increase a sense of purpose, 
direction, meaning, and intrinsic motivation.19 Enriching a job in this way is dif￾ferent from enlarging it (adding more tasks and requirements). It involves add￾ing another layer of responsibility and meaning. Job enrichment has its roots in 
Herzberg’s theories (see the previous chapter) of providing hygiene factors to 
increase motivation at work.
Early reviews suggest that job enrichment can be effective at reducing turn￾over, almost twice as effective as giving employees a “realistic preview” of the work 
before they join the organization.20 In a survey of over twenty thousand British 
employees, job enrichment practices were related to organizations’ financial per￾formance, labor productivity, absenteeism, and output quality through improve￾ments in job satisfaction.21 Regardless of these benefits, managers who are high 
on openness (see the chapter on personality and individual differences) and 
are in autonomous jobs themselves tend to be more likely to design jobs that are 
enriching.22 Regardless of personality, managers should consider the benefits of 
job enrichment and work against natural inclinations to micromanage.
Relational Job Design
While redesigning jobs on the basis of job characteristics theory is likely to 
make work more intrinsically motivating, research is focusing on how to make 
jobs more prosocially motivating to people. In other words, how can managers 
design work so employees are motivated to promote the well-being of the orga￾nization’s beneficiaries (customers, clients, patients, and employees)? This view, 
relational job design, shifts the spotlight from the employee to those whose lives 
are affected by the job that the employee performs.23 It also motivates indi￾viduals toward increased job performance and job satisfaction, especially when 
coupled with designing and redesigning jobs for autonomy.24 Why do these con￾nections have such positive consequences? Meeting beneficiaries firsthand—or 
even just seeing pictures of them—allows employees to see that their actions 
affect a real person and have tangible consequences. It makes customers or cli￾ents more memorable and emotionally vivid, which leads employees to consider 
the effects of their work actions more. Connections allow employees to take the 
perspective of beneficiaries, which fosters higher levels of commitment.

One way to make jobs more prosocially motivating is to relate stories from 
customers who have found the company’s products or services to be helpful. For 
example, the medical device manufacturer Medtronic invites people to describe 
how its products have improved or even saved their lives and shares these sto￾ries with employees during annual meetings, which provides the employees a 
powerful reminder of the impact of their work.25 For instance, Medtronic found 
that their services improve the lives of two people every second.26 As another 
example, researchers found that when university fundraisers briefly interacted 
with the undergraduates who would receive the scholarship money they raised, 
they persisted 42 percent longer and raised nearly twice as much money as those 
who did not interact with potential recipients.27 The positive impact was appar￾ent even when fundraisers met with just a single scholarship recipient. Personal 
contact with beneficiaries may not always be necessary. Once a child’s chemo￾therapy comes to an end at one of the many cancer centers across the United 
States and they have successfully defeated cancer, it has become tradition for 
the child to ring a bell, the sound of which is often broadcast throughout many 
areas of the hospital. The mere act of hearing this bell is inspiring to the staff. 
Dr. ZoAnn Dryer of the Texas Children’s Cancer Center notes, “Every time that 
bell rings, it’s like you know what, somebody else has done it. That’s what this is 
all about.”28

Alternative Work Arrangements
Another approach to enhancing motivation is to consider alternative work 
arrangements such as flextime, job sharing, and telecommuting.29 These are 
likely to be especially important for a diverse workforce of dual-earner couples, 
single parents, and employees caring for a sick or aging relatives. For exam￾ple, flextime and telework can help women continue to advance their careers 
after childbirth.30 Furthermore, the advent of COVID-19 has renewed an inter￾est in telecommuting as a potentially “permanent” shift in the workforce,

an establishment of a “new normal” in the working world.31 Before the pan￾demic, only 15 to 27 percent of workers in the United States worked completely 
remotely.32 In the midst of the pandemic, 67 percent of employers were taking 
steps to shift their employees toward remote work.33
But are alternative work arrangements here to stay? First, some research 
suggests that around 75  million U.S. employees are capable of working 
from home. This number represents over half (56  percent) of the work￾force.34 Second, about two-thirds of people wanted to continue working 
remotely,35 and a whopping 98  percent of over two thousand remote work￾ers during COVID-19 expressed interest in working this way for the rest of 
their careers.36 Third, a Gartner survey suggested that 74  percent of the 
executives surveyed would keep at least a portion of their workforce remote 
after the pandemic.37 However, the influence of the pandemic did not just 
heighten interest in telecommuting—flextime and job sharing also received 
renewed interest, given that it was now easier for people to work whenever, 
wherever, juggle work and home commitments more flexibly, and use proj￾ect management and digital versioning software (e.g., GitHub) to quickly 
pick up work where their coworkers left off.38 Furthermore, COVID-19 con￾tinued the heightened interest in the new nature of work in the gig economy 
(described in the introductory chapter). The often flexible nature of gig 
work enabled many “frontline” workers to manage home demands while at 
the same time working when it was convenient for them.39
Flextime
Jim Ware, founder of Focus Consulting Group, notes that “if you’re trying to 
build a first-rate culture that attracts and retains people, you better make sure 
you get the rewards piece right and part of that is autonomy.”40 Flexibility is a 
key attractive benefit that organizations can offer employees that helps make 
their lives easier by giving them a sense of control over when and where they do 
their work.41 For example, Polen Capital Management doubled its workforce 
in three years after instituting a flextime, or “flexible work time,” policy.42 In 
countries such as Finland, the majority of full-time workers have a legal right 
to decide the location and timing for at least half of their working schedule.43
Globally, a number of different flextime arrangements exist, from flexible meal￾time, breaks and shifts to “compressed workweeks” (e.g., working longer each 
day for a shorter number of days each week).44
In one arrangement, flextime employees work a specific number of hours 
per week but may vary their hours of work within limits. As in Exhibit 8-2, each 
day consists of a common core, usually 6 hours, with a flexibility band surround￾ing it. The core may be 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., with the “virtual office” opening 
at 6:00 a.m. and closing at 6:00 p.m. Employees should be working during the 
common core period, but they may accumulate their other two hours around 
that. Some flextime programs allow employees to accumulate extra hours and 
turn them into days off. Some, like the Sterling-Rice Group, even allow employ￾ees to “craft” the nature of flexible work (see Myth or Science?): They propose, 
after being hired, how, when, and where they would like to complete the work 
and adjust accordingly as they work.45 However, most organizations implement 
the “core business hours” approach to flextime (57  percent of employers) 
compared with other approaches (29 percent of employers not establishing 
a common core).46
Flextime has become extremely popular, and organizations reap benefits 
from it as well. For instance, the Society for Human Resource Management 
(SHRM) reports that organizations can experience enhanced productivity by 
boosting employee morale, providing employees the ability to work during 
flextime Flexible work hours.
M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 276 14/12/22 4:12 PMMotivation: From Concepts to Applications CHAPTER 8 277
hours that better suit their natural energy cycles (e.g., morning larks versus 
night owls), potentially extending hours of operation, and reducing commut￾ing challenges. 48 As an example, the Executive Education program at the MIT 
Sloan School of Management implemented flextime practices and found that 
employees were actually more productive, especially in the face of commuting 
challenges (e.g., Boston’s harsh winters). 49 It appears as if flextime has become 
an important job design element for many employees—50 percent of employ￾ees cite flexible arrangements as a very important aspect of their job satisfaction, 
34 percent stated that they would remain with their current employer because 
of flexible arrangements, and 15 percent would seek employment elsewhere in 
order to obtain more flexibility. 50
 Most of the evidence for flextime stacks up favorably. One review of over 40 
studies suggests that flextime is related to positive work outcomes in general, 
but only weakly—the effects are much stronger when considering reductions in 
absenteeism and, to a lesser degree, improvements in productivity and schedule 
satisfaction. 51 Much less promising, the empirical evidence from over 100,000 
employees suggests that, although flextime is weakly effective at reducing the 
 Job Crafting Is a Practical Way to Reduce 
Boredom and Burnout 
 What if you could make your 
work tasks feel less boring? 
Well, it turns out that job craft￾ing, a relatively new approach to job 
design, could transform work that once 
felt meaningless into something that 
feels valuable. Job crafting describes 
how employees can customize their 
jobs by actively altering their tasks or 
interacting with others at work to capi￾talize on their unique skills and abili￾ties. Job crafting has been studied and 
applied for many years within various 
organizations, from Fortune 500 com￾panies to small nonprofits. In these 
companies, it is not uncommon to find 
employees at all levels and in all types 
of occupations engaging in job crafting. 
Employees who do so become more 
engaged and satisfied with their work, 
perform better, and develop greater 
personal resilience. 
 For job crafting to be success￾ful, employees should draw on their 
strengths (e.g., specialized knowledge, 
a particular skill, etc.) to create value for 
others. For example, suppose you are 
an administrative assistant at a primary 
school. You might view your job primar￾ily as filling out late slips and calling 
parents when their children are absent. 
Alternatively, through job crafting, you 
may begin to see your role more as a 
liaison. For instance, you could think 
about using your communication skills to 
ensure that students are supported both 
at school and at home. 
 Job crafting is not always beneficial 
or even practical. For example, job craft￾ing can create more stress if you take on 
more work or change your work without 
understanding your manager’s goals for 
those tasks. The degree to which job 
crafting can help with boredom and burn￾out depends on the type of job crafting 
utilized. A specific type of job crafting, 
avoidance demands crafting , is a strategy 
by which employees attempt to cope with 
extreme job demands. For example, you 
may engage in job crafting by taking on 
additional work that capitalizes on your 
skill set, but you avoid pressing demands 
you need to meet in your “official” job 
description. Employees using this type 
of job crafting may end up not meeting 
performance expectations, missing dead￾lines, and letting their supervisors and 
coworkers down. Furthermore, several 
studies have found avoidance demands 
crafting is likely to have other damaging 
consequences such as work intensifica￾tion, health problems, and turnover. 
 There are also certain types of peo￾ple who may be more likely to experience 
job crafting benefits. For example, those 
with a proactive personality are more 
likely to engage in job crafting behaviors. 
Some personality traits (e.g., agreeable￾ness, conscientiousness, extroversion, 
and openness to experience) may predis￾pose some employees to engage in job 
crafting. Finally, individuals with higher 
education levels are also more likely to 
job craft. Education helps to facilitate 
the acquisition of job knowledge and 
expertise, which then facilitates job 
crafting. Thus, while job crafting shows 
promising benefits for reducing boredom 
and burnout, employees must use the 
appropriate type of job crafting and be 
motivated to engage in job crafting. 47 
 Myth or Science? 
M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 277 14/12/22 4:12 PM278 PART 2 The Individual
Job Sharing
Job sharing allows two or more individuals to split a traditional full-time job.57
One employee might perform the job from 8:00 a.m. to noon and the other 
from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., or the two could work full but alternate days. For 
example, actor-puppeteers Lizzie Wort and Ruth Calkin are now able to tour 
Britain doing what they love: performing as the Twirlywoos, puppets from 
a popular UK children’s TV program.58 This is now possible due to a theatre 
job share arrangement, which has the “potential to revolutionize” how actors 
approach touring and “open up possibilities... for performers with children.”59
Only 10 percent of U.S. organizations offered job sharing in 2015.60 Some 
of the reasons it is not more widely adopted include the difficulty of finding 
compatible partners to job-share and the historically negative perceptions of 
individuals not completely committed to their jobs and employers. However, 
eliminating job sharing for these reasons might be shortsighted. Job sharing 
allows an organization to draw on the talents of more than one individual for 
a given job. It opens the opportunity to acquire skilled workers—for instance, 
retirees and parents with young children—who might not be available on a full￾time basis. From employees’ perspectives, job sharing can increase motivation 
and satisfaction if they can work when they would not normally be able to do so.
An employer’s decision to use job sharing is often based on policy and finan￾cial reasons. Two part-time employees sharing a job can be less expensive in 
terms of salary and benefits than one full-timer, but this may not be the case 
because training, coordination, and administrative costs can still be high. 
Ideally, employers should consider each employee and job separately, seeking to 
match the skills, personality, and needs of the employee with the tasks required 
for the job and considering that individual’s motivating factors.
Telecommuting
As noted in the beginning of this section, people rarely had a choice regard￾ing whether to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although 
full-time virtual work was only offered by about one in four employers before 
the pandemic, it was still becoming fairly prevalent, with 69 percent of employ￾ers offering it at least occasionally.61
Regardless, is working from home more effective? Do employees like 
working from home? For some, it might be close to the ideal job: no rush 
hour traffic, freedom to dress as you please, and potentially fewer inter￾ruptions (depending upon how tumultuous your family life is!). Others

extent to which work interferes with family, it does not affect situations in which 
family interferes with work.52
However, flextime’s effects on work–life balance are more nuanced than 
they might appear. For example, two studies of German employees suggest that, 
although flextime leads employees to set stronger work–life boundaries (which 
in turn makes them happier), these boundaries are not truly “set” unless the 
employees complete their daily goals at work.53 These studies suggest that if flex￾time is used too much, it can undermine goal accomplishment. Furthermore, 
flextime’s major drawback is that it is not applicable to every job or every worker. 
For example, some research suggests both young, healthy employees and older, 
unhealthy employees benefit the most from flextime.54 It also appears that peo￾ple who have a strong desire to separate their work and family lives are less 
apt to use flextime.55 Those who ask for it are often stigmatized, which may be 
avoided if the majority of the organization’s leaders adopt flexible hours to sig￾nal that flextime is acceptable.56
M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 278 14/12/22 4:12 PMMotivation: From Concepts to Applications CHAPTER 8 279
might be extremely apprehensive, worrying about the negative effects of 
virtual work on the work–life boundaries (such as those experienced dur￾ing COVID-19)62 as well as sustaining culture, cohesion, and communica￾tion within the workplace.63 For instance, only 5 percent of executives think 
that employees do not need to be in the office or meet in person at all 
to maintain a company culture.64 Furthermore, many dual-career couples 
with children had a much harder time with telecommuting during the 
pandemic, suggesting that telecommuting is only as good as the support 
received by telecommuters and their boundary management strategies.65
Telecommuting refers to working at home or anywhere else the employee 
chooses that is outside the physical workplace.66
What kinds of jobs lend themselves to telecommuting? McKinsey & 
Company have recently conducted a widespread study of over two thousand 
tasks from eight hundred jobs within nine different countries.67 McKinsey 
researchers discovered that, at the industry level, most industries could on 
average telecommute for at least 29 percent of the time without productiv￾ity loss. Of course, this figure should be qualified by considering the spe￾cific industry. Finance, insurance, management, information technology, 
and other “knowledge worker” professionals can telecommute for greater 
periods of time without productivity loss than, say, manufacturing, con￾struction, retail, and food service workers. As shown in the OB Poll, most 
telecommuting Working from home or 
anywhere else the employee chooses that is 
outside the physical workplace.

telecommuters have attained high levels of higher education, demonstrat￾ing that many telecommuters are perhaps employed as knowledge workers. 
At the job-task level, it becomes clear that it is difficult for any job to be 
fully remote. Even tasks that are the most suitable for telecommuting (e.g., 
updating knowledge and learning, interacting with computers, and think￾ing creatively) cannot be done remotely on occasion (e.g., learning how 
to perform a medical surgery, setting up computer hardware in someone’s 
home, creating a physical prototype for a new product). 
 Telecommuting has several benefits. It increases performance and job sat￾isfaction; to a lesser degree, it reduces role stress and turnover intentions. 68
Employees who work virtually more than 2.5 days a week tend to experience the 
benefits of reductions in work–family conflict more intensely than those who 
are in the office the majority of their workweek. 69 Beyond the benefits to orga￾nizations and their employees, telecommuting has potential benefits to soci￾ety. One study estimated that if people in the United States telecommuted half 
the time, carbon emissions would be reduced by approximately 51 metric tons 
per year. Environmental savings could come from lower office energy consump￾tion, fewer traffic jams that emit greenhouse gases, and a reduced need for road 
repairs. 70
 Telecommuting has several downsides too. In today’s team-focused work￾place, telecommuting may lead to social loafing (i.e., employees shirking 
responsibility in a team setting), especially when the employees have many 
family responsibilities but their teammates do not. 71 Your manager work￾ing remotely can affect your performance negatively, as they may be less 
readily available to provide guidance or assistance. 72 Managers are also 
challenged to handle the demotivation of office workers who feel they are 
unfairly denied the freedom of telecommuters. 73 The COVID-19 pandemic 
in particular brought this issue to light, with many “essential workers” 
being unable to protect their health, reduce job stress, and manage their 
home obligations (e.g., caring for vulnerable relatives). 74 From the work￾ers’ standpoint, telecommuting can increase feelings of isolation as well as

reduce job satisfaction and coworker relationship quality.75 On the other 
hand, it can help you “get away from them all” if your working situation is 
emotionally exhausting.76 Research indicates that if you are forced to work 
from home, although you may experience less work–family conflict in gen￾eral, you might still experience it if you work hours beyond the contracted 
workweek and are constantly “on call.”77 Telecommuters are also vulnerable 
to the “out of sight, out of mind” effect: Employees who are not physically 
present in the same location do not share in day-to-day informal workplace 
interactions, which may put them at a disadvantage when it comes to raises 
and promotions because they are perceived as not putting in the requisite 
face time (unless they put in the effort to do so virtually).78 However, this 
may not be the case if telework is the norm with the organization, there is 
still common contact with the supervisor, and it is clear that the employee is 
working (e.g., they have a heavy workload and are productive).
If telecommuting is here to stay, what can employees and employers do to 
ensure the arrangements are effective? Apart from ensuring the arrangement 
is right for the position,79 the success of telecommuting always depends on the 
quality of communications to establish good, though remote, working relation￾ships. Even though telecommuting can be a motivating force in and of itself, 
it appears that even telecommuters need motivation and that the telecommut￾ers themselves may be responsible for sustaining this motivation. For example, 
one recent study of telecommuters found that successful and satisfied tele￾commuters set goals for themselves, rewarded themselves when they did great 
work, and thrived with autonomy.80 Further, using smart collaboration tools, 
communicating frequently, clear and transparent policies, and building trust 
among virtual team members can help improve the effectiveness of telework for 
the whole team.81 During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers developed the 
assess-create-support framework to help aid in establishing effective telecom￾muting practices.82 This framework involves assessing employee telecommut￾ing needs, creating practices that empower employees to maintain work–home 
boundaries, and supporting these practices through adjustment, encourage￾ment, role-modeling, and monitoring. Indeed, adaptation may be an important 
component to the success of telecommuting, as tailored approaches to develop 
each employee’s schedule may lead to better performance while working from 
home.83 Telecommuting certainly does appear to make sense given changes in 
technology, the nature of work, and preferences of workers.
Employee Involvement
Employee involvement and participation (EIP)84 is a process that uses employ￾ees’ input to increase their commitment to organizational success. If workers 
are engaged in decisions that increase their autonomy and control over their 
work lives, they will become more motivated, more committed to the organiza￾tion, more productive, and more satisfied with their jobs. These benefits do 
not stop with individuals—when teams are given more control over their work, 
morale and performance increase as well.85
Examples of Employee Involvement Programs (EIP)
Let’s look at two major forms of employee involvement—participative manage￾ment and representative participation—in more detail.
Participative Management Common to all participative management programs 
is joint decision making, in which subordinates share a significant degree of 
employee involvement and participation

M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 281 14/12/22 4:12 PM282 PART 2 The Individual
decision-making power with their immediate superiors.86 This sharing can occur 
either formally through, say, briefings or surveys or informally through daily con￾sultations as a way to enhance motivation through trust and commitment.87 For 
example, emergency medical service staff can meet to provide improvement oppor￾tunities based on their medical specialty areas—improvements to the process that 
can literally save lives.88 Participative management has, at times, been considered 
a panacea or cure-all for poor morale and low productivity—indeed, evidence sug￾gests that participative management reduces the negative effects of job insecurity on 
satisfaction and turnover intentions.89 For participative management to be effective, 
however, followers must have trust and confidence in their leaders and be prepared 
for the change in management style, whereas leaders should avoid coercive tech￾niques, stress the organizational consequences of decision making to their followers, 
and review progress periodically.90
Studies of the participation–organizational performance relationship 
have yielded more mixed findings.91 Organizations that institute participa￾tive management may realize higher stock returns, lower turnover rates, 
and higher labor productivity, although these effects are typically not 
large.92
Representative Participation Many countries require companies to practice 
representative participation.93 Representative participation redistributes power 
within an organization, putting labor’s interests on a more equal footing with 
the interests of management and stockholders by including a small group of 
employees as participants in decision making. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, 
Australia, and New Zealand, representative participation was originally the only 
EIP program, formed to allow employee representatives to discuss issues outside 
union agreements, and the representatives were all from the union. However, 
representative groups are now increasingly a mix of union and nonunion, sepa￾rate from the union arrangement.94
The two most common forms of representation are works councils and 
board representatives. Works councils are groups of nominated or elected 
employees who must be consulted when management makes decisions about 
employees. Board representatives are employees who sit on a company’s 
board of directors and represent employees’ interests. The influence of rep￾resentative participation on working employees seems to be mixed, but gen￾erally an employee would need to feel their interests are well represented 
and make a difference to the organization for motivation to increase. Thus, 
representative participation as a motivational tool is surpassed by more direct 
participation methods.
Cultural Considerations in Implementing EIP Programs
To be successful, EIP programs should be tailored to local and national 
norms.95 A study of four countries, including India and the United States, 
confirmed the importance of modifying practices to reflect national cul￾ture.96 While U.S. employees readily accepted EIP programs, managers 
in India who tried to empower their employees were rated low by those 
employees. These reactions are consistent with India’s high-power-distance 
culture, which accepts and expects differences in authority. The work cul￾ture in India may not be in as much transition as it is in China, where some 
employees are becoming less high-power-distance oriented. Chinese work￾ers who were very accepting of traditional Chinese cultural values showed 
few benefits from participative decision making. However, Chinese workers 
who were less traditional were more satisfied and had higher performance 
ratings under participative management.97 Another study conducted in 
representative participation A system in 
which workers participate in organizational 
decision making through a small group of 
representative employees.
M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 282 14/12/22 4:12 PMMotivation: From Concepts to Applications CHAPTER 8 283
China showed that involvement increased employees’ thoughts and feelings 
of job security, which enhanced their well-being.98 These differences within 
China may well reflect the current transitional nature of Chinese culture. 
For example, research in urban China indicated that some aspects of EIP 
programs—namely, those that favor consultation and expression but not 
participation in decision making—yield higher job satisfaction.99
In sum, EIP programs clearly have the potential to increase employ￾ees’ intrinsic motivation. The opportunity to make and implement 
decisions—and then see them work out—can contribute to all desirable 
organizational outcomes. Giving employees control over key decisions, 
along with ensuring that their interests are represented, can enhance 
feelings of procedural justice. But like any other initiatives, EIP pro￾grams must be designed carefully.
Using Extrinsic Rewards to Motivate 
Employees
As we saw in the chapter on job attitudes, pay is not the only factor driving job 
satisfaction. However, it does motivate people, and companies often underes￾timate its importance. Approximately 47 percent of respondents to an SHRM 
survey indicated that they were staying with their current employer because of 
the pay. Furthermore, 62 percent of respondents indicated they were seeking a 
job outside their current organization because of the pay. In fact, pay was the 
number one reason employees both stayed and left their current organizations, 
compared with thirteen other reasons. (Benefits, career advancement opportu￾nities, and work–life flexibility were also key factors.)100
Given that pay is so important, how can organizations develop competi￾tive compensation strategies that retain employees and discourage them from

seeking employment elsewhere? How can they harness motivation theory and 
research to bolster their strategies? Incredibly, according to PayScale’s 2021 Best 
Practices survey (the largest pay survey worldwide), over half of organizations sur￾veyed admit to not having a compensation strategy at all.101 In this section, we 
consider (1) what to pay employees (decided by establishing a pay structure) 
and (2) how to pay individual employees (decided through pay plans).
What to Pay: Establishing a Pay Structure
There are many ways to pay employees.102 The process of initially setting pay 
levels entails balancing internal equity—the worth of the job to the organiza￾tion (sometimes established through a technical process called job evalua￾tion) and external equity—the competitiveness of an organization’s pay relative 
to pay in its industry (usually established through benchmarking surveys).103
Obviously, the best pay system reflects what the job is worth and also stays com￾petitive relative to the labor market. Some organizations prefer to pay above 
the market. Other organizations may lag behind the market because they can￾not afford to pay market rates or they are willing to bear the costs of paying 
below market (namely, higher turnover because people are lured to better￾paying jobs). Some companies that have realized impressive gains in income 
and profit margins have done so in part by holding down employee wages,104
whereas others use fair or competitive pay strategies as a way to engage and 
retain employees.105
Pay more, and you may get better-qualified, more highly motivated employ￾ees who will stay with the organization longer and perhaps be more likely to per￾form and innovate.106 A study covering 126 large organizations found employees 
who believed they were receiving a competitive pay level experienced higher 
morale and were more productive, and customers were more satisfied as well.107
But pay is often the highest single operating cost for an organization, which 
means paying too much can make the organization’s products or services too 
expensive. Furthermore, the salience of money may even motivate employees 
toward self-serving behavior. For example, one study of National Hockey League 
(NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA) players found that during 
the final contract year, players engage in more self-serving behaviors while in 
play.108 It’s a strategic decision an organization must make with clear trade-offs.
In the retail rivalry between Walmart and Costco, pay plays a primary 
role.109 Over a decade ago, Walmart raised its pay to be more competitive 
with other big-box stores like Costco—but it cut employees’ hours at the 
same time, much to the ire of employees. It is tempting to immediately 
conclude that the company that pays better will do better, but the situation 
is much more nuanced than that. The average worker at Costco is paid at 
a much higher rate when compared to workers at Walmart or its wholesale 
trade counterpart, Sam’s Club. Costco’s strategy involves a laser-like focus 
on its store operations and customer experience—it will get more if it pays 
more. Costco employs about two hundred thousand people and pays them 
a minimum of $15 an hour. Walmart, on the other hand, maintains a very 
large network of stores worldwide. Its costs are much higher than Costco’s, 
and it needs to keep these stores stocked and operational. Worldwide, 
Walmart employs over two million people and pays its employees a base 
wage of $11 an hour on average. Given these different requirements and 
strategies, each organization has adopted different pay strategies. However, 
as we have seen in the prior chapter (and will continue to see in this chap￾ter), pay clearly matters for employee motivation, attitudes, well-being, and 
turnover. We can conclude that employees will likely be happier and less 
likely to turn over at Costco when compared to Walmart.

How to Pay: Rewarding Individual Employees Through 
Variable-Pay Programs
“Why should I put any extra effort into this job?,” asked Justice, a fourth-grade 
elementary schoolteacher in Denver, Colorado. “I can excel, or I can do the bare 
minimum. It makes no difference. I get paid the same. Why do anything above 
the minimum to get by?” Comments like Justice’s have been voiced by school￾teachers for decades because pay increases were tied to seniority. However, 
many states have altered their compensation systems to motivate teachers by 
linking pay to results in the classroom, and other states are considering such 
programs.110 Many organizations, public and private, are moving away from 
pay based on seniority or credentials. For instance, Japanese company Hitachi 
recently announced that it was moving away from seniority-based pay. Chairman 
Hiroaki Nakanishi noted that the model worked in its early days when new hires 
had to produce its products from scraps and learned from experience through￾out their job tenure—but those days are gone, and the older model just does 
not work anymore.111
Piece-rate, merit-based, bonus, profit-sharing, and employee stock owner￾ship plans are all forms of a variable-pay program (also known as pay for per￾formance), which bases a portion of an employee’s pay on some individual 
and/or organizational measure of performance.112 The variable portion may 
be all or part of the paycheck, and it may be paid annually or upon attainment 
of benchmarks. It can also be either optional for the employee or an accepted 
condition of employment.113 Globally, around 85 percent of companies offer 
some form of variable-pay plan.114 Variable-pay plans have long been used to 
compensate salespeople and executives, but the scope of variable-pay jobs has 
broadened to include virtually all employment categories.
Organizations often use a combination of organization-, unit-, and 
individual-level performance to allocate awards, with over half of the short￾term incentive coming from the organization’s overall performance and 
the other half attributable to a combination of individual and unit perfor￾mance.115 Although the COVID-19 pandemic had an immense impact on 
organizational pay strategies in 2020, it appears that pay increases are still on

board for 2021, with 85 percent of companies globally still planning on pay 
increases.116 In 2020, approximately 70 percent of organizations offered vari￾able pay as a part of total compensation.117
Pay-for-Performance Efficacy Although pay-for-performance plans do have 
small positive effects on employee and group performance,118 the results 
of pay-for-performance plans vary by several conditions. For instance, some 
research suggests that pay-for-performance is only effective in stable economic 
environments and in organizations that have fair policies.119 There are cultural 
differences as well: When guanxi (e.g., specific, personal connections between 
subordinates, supervisors, and coworkers) plays a role in human resource 
(HR) practices, pay-for-performance plans tend to be less effective.120 Pay-for￾performance may also matter more at different times in an individual’s ten￾ure. One study of shareholder returns of the U.S. S&P’s 500 firms suggests that 
pay-for-performance plans (including stock options and bonuses) are most 
effective for CEOs when they start out, and their relationship with shareholder 
returns slowly decreases over time; however, the relationship between tradi￾tional plans and shareholder returns increases over time.121
Regardless of these modest, positive effects, not all employees see a strong 
connection between pay and performance. Furthermore, the nature of perfor￾mance also matters for how employees react to such plans. As we stated, teacher 
pay-for-performance plans are starting to be used more frequently, particularly 
those that are based on student test scores; research on thousands of teach￾ers in the United States has shown that these programs (1) are not having a 
positive impact on teacher motivation or teaching practices and (2) have actu￾ally led to higher levels of stress, along with counterproductive work behaviors 
(CWBs), such as cheating and even bullying of students to perform better on 
tests.122 As another example, research on inventors in corporate research and 
development (R&D) departments shows that rewards for inventions actually 
lead to reduced motivation, less collaboration between scientist coworkers, and 
even lower-quality inventions.123 These examples highlight the potential role 
of expectancy and instrumentality discussed in expectancy theory (see the pre￾vious chapter). Do teachers have control over students’ test scores? Do scien￾tists have control over the outcomes of their innovation efforts? Expectancy or 
instrumentality breakdowns can be a very demotivating force indeed.
Pay-for-performance may also have a direct effect on workplace dynamics: 
When managers are subject to pay-for-performance, it leads to employer–employee 
relationship strain and can increase employee turnover.124 Employees in 
these situations may also compete with their coworkers and may actively 
try to harm one another.125 Also, some employees react more negatively to 
pay-for-performance, especially when they feel inequity or unfairness compared 
with other employees. For example, employees in Britain with disabilities tend 
to react more negatively to pay-for-performance than others.126 Furthermore, 
although “star employees” may react well toward pay-for-performance plans 
and dispersion among employees,127 average or underperforming employees 
may feel alienated by such plans, and managers may step in to make “excep￾tions” when these employees fall behind.128 As a result, if the other employees 
become aware of these “special deals,” they may begin to feel even more nega￾tively and perform worse than they did before they were aware that these agree￾ments were being made.129
Pay Secrecy Secrecy plays a role in the motivational success of variable-pay 
plans.130 In some government and nonprofit agencies, pay amounts are either 
specifically or generally made public, but most U.S. organizations encourage 
or require pay secrecy.131 Is this good or bad? Pay secrecy initially appears to 
M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 286 14/12/22 4:12 PMMotivation: From Concepts to Applications CHAPTER 8 287
have a detrimental effect on job performance.132 Individual pay amounts may 
not need to be broadcast to restore the balance, but if general pay categories 
are made public and employees feel variable pay is linked objectively to their 
performance, the motivational effects of variable pay can be retained.133 On the 
other hand, pay transparency can also have negative effects: Research suggests 
that it can facilitate comparisons between people, leading coworkers to become 
jealous and abstain from cooperating or helping one another.134 One thing 
seems to be clear: Justice perceptions (as discussed in the previous chapter) play 
a huge role in determining how employees react, regardless of the strategy.135
Types of Pay-for-Performance Plans Pay-for-performance is not a one￾size-fits-all, unitary approach. There are multiple ways of implementing a 
pay-for-performance plan that each have their own unique benefits and limita￾tions. In the sections that follow, we discuss these in more detail.
Piece-Rate Pay The piece-rate pay plan has long been popular as a means of 
compensating production workers with a fixed sum for each unit of production 
completed, but it can be used in any organizational setting where the outputs 
are similar enough to be evaluated by quantity.136 A pure piece-rate plan pro￾vides no base salary and pays the employee only for what they produce. Ballpark 
workers selling peanuts and soda are frequently paid piece-rate. If they sell forty 
bags of peanuts for a dollar each, their take is $40. The more peanuts they sell, 
the more they earn. Alternatively, piece-rate plans are sometimes used in teams. 
For example, a ballpark worker would make money on the total number of bags 
of peanuts sold by the concessions team during a game.
Piece-rate plans are known to produce higher effort, productivity, and wages, 
so they can be attractive to organizations and motivating for workers.137 In fact, 
one major Chinese university increased its piece-rate pay for articles by professors 
and realized an increase of 50 percent in research productivity.138 The chief con￾cern of both individual and team piece-rate workers is financial risk. One study, 
for instance, found that 68 percent of risk-averse individuals (see the chapter on 
perception and decision making) prefer an individual piece-rate system and that 
lower performers prefer team piece-rate pay. Why? The authors suggested risk￾averse and high-performing individuals would rather take their chances on pay 
based on what they can control (their own work) because they are concerned oth￾ers will slack off in a team setting.139 What about using both? Recent work suggests 
that doing so might address the limitations of using either in isolation: Across 
more than 22,000 European establishments, using both plans (combined with an 
EIP approach described earlier) led to stark increases in employee innovation.140
Organizations, on the other hand, should verify that their piece-rate plans 
are indeed motivating to individuals. When the pace of work is determined by 
uncontrollable factors such as customer requests rather than internal factors 
such as coworkers, targets, and machines, a piece rate plan is not motivating.141
Either way, managers must be mindful of the motivation for workers to decrease 
quality and thus increase their speed of output.
While piece-rate plans can be a powerful motivator in many organizational 
settings, an obvious limitation is that they are not feasible for many jobs. An 
emergency room (ER) doctor and nurse can earn significant salaries regardless 
of the number of patients they see or their patients’ outcomes. Would it be bet￾ter to pay them only if their patients fully recover? It seems unlikely that most 
would accept such a deal, and it might cause unanticipated consequences as 
well (such as ERs turning away patients with terminal diseases or life-threatening 
injuries). Although incentives are motivating and relevant for some jobs, it is 
unrealistic to think they work universally.

M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 287 14/12/22 4:12 PM288 PART 2 The Individual
Merit-Based Pay A merit-based pay plan pays for individual performance based 
on performance appraisal ratings.142 If designed correctly, merit-based plans let 
individuals perceive a strong relationship between their performance and their 
rewards.143
Many organizations have merit pay plans, especially for salaried employ￾ees. Although skills-based pay is relatively uncommon (e.g., receiving pay 
based on maintaining a specialized skill set), the typical “end-of-year” 
bonus is given in about 26 percent of organizations.144 Merit pay increases 
are incredibly common, but generally are a very small component of an 
organization’s salary budgets (often between 0 and 4 percent of the entire 
budget).145 A move away from merit pay, on the other hand, is coming from 
some organizations that do not feel it separates high and low performers 
enough. When the annual review and raise are months away, the motiva￾tion of this reward for high performers diminishes. Even companies that 
have retained merit pay are rethinking the allocation.146 However, some 
data from a service-related organization suggests that when merit pay and 
bonuses (discussed later) are used in tandem, merit raises tend to be most 
effective at increasing job performance and preventing turnover—although 
bonuses may affect future performance to a larger extent.147 Although you 
might think a person’s average level of performance is the key factor in 
merit pay decisions, the projected level of future performance also plays 
a role. One study found that NBA players whose performance was on an 
upward trend were paid more than their average performance would have 
predicted. Managers of all organizations may unknowingly be basing merit 
pay decisions on how they think employees will perform, which may result in 
overly optimistic (or pessimistic) pay decisions.148
Despite their intuitive appeal, merit pay plans have several limitations. One is 
that they are typically based on annual performance appraisal data and thus are 
only as valid as the performance ratings, which are often subjective. This brings 
up issues of discrimination, as we discussed in the chapter on diversity, equity, and 
inclusion, in organizations. Research indicates that Black employees receive lower 
performance ratings than White employees and that there are demographic differ￾ences in the distribution of salary increases.149 Lastly, unions typically resist merit 
pay plans. Relatively few teachers are covered by merit pay for this reason. Instead, 
seniority-based pay, which gives all employees the same raises, predominates.
Bonuses Bonuses are a significant component of total compensation for 
many jobs.150 Once reserved for upper management, bonus plans are now rou￾tinely offered to employees in all levels of the organization. A recent survey, for 
instance, suggests that bonuses are now the most common variable-pay incen￾tive, with approximately 53 percent of organizations offering them to employ￾ees.151 The incentive effects should be higher than those of merit pay because, 
rather than paying for previous performance now rolled into base pay, bonuses 
reward recent performance. (Merit pay is cumulative, but the increases are gen￾erally much smaller than bonus amounts.) Bonuses can be directed toward a 
number of organizational aims, such as referring other employees as potential 
job candidates, team-level or company-wide performance bonuses, sign-on or 
hiring bonuses, or even those that are discretionary, rewarding excellent behav￾iors as they occur.152 When times are bad, firms can cut bonuses to reduce 
compensation costs. Firms may even cut executive bonuses when in the face of 
scandal, often to signal to shareholders that they are taking the scandal seriously 
and working to address the situation.153
Bonus plans have a clear upside: They are motivating for workers. As an 
example, a study in India found that when a higher percentage of overall pay 
was reserved for the potential bonuses of managers and employees, productivity

increased.154 This example also highlights the downside of bonuses: They leave 
employees’ pay more vulnerable to cuts. This is problematic especially when 
employees depend on bonuses or take them for granted. “People have begun 
to live as if bonuses were not bonuses at all but part of their expected annual 
income,” said Jay Lorsch, a Harvard Business School professor.
The way bonuses and rewards are categorized also affects peoples’ motiva￾tion. Splitting rewards and bonuses into categories may increase motivation.155
Why? Because people are more likely to feel they missed out on a reward if 
they do not receive one from each category and then work harder to earn 
rewards from more categories. Short-term bonuses can also have an effect: In 
a high-tech manufacturing factory, cash, family meal vouchers, and employee 
recognition (see later in this chapter) all increased performance by 5  per￾cent, and nonmoney-based bonuses were actually more effective at improving 
performance.156
Profit-Sharing Plan A profit-sharing plan distributes compensation based 
on some established formula designed around a company’s profitability.157
Compensation can be direct cash outlays or, particularly for top manag￾ers, allocations of stock options. When you read about executives like Mark 
Zuckerberg, who accepts an absurdly modest $1 salary, remember that many 
executives benefit from other forms of income. In fact, Zuckerberg’s net worth 
is over $100 billion; in 2019, he brought in over $23 million in earnings.158 Of 
course, most profit-sharing plans are not so grand in scale. For example, Fiat 
Chrysler automobile workers were paid up to $8,000 in profit-sharing income 
in 2020.159
Studies generally support the idea that organizations with profit-sharing 
plans have higher levels of profitability than those without them.160 These 
plans have also been linked to higher levels of employee commitment, espe￾cially in small organizations.161 Profit sharing at the organizational level appears 
to have positive impacts on employee attitudes; employees report a greater 
feeling of psychological ownership.162 Profit-sharing plans motivate individu￾als to higher job performance when they are used in combination with other 
pay-for-performance plans.163 Obviously, profit sharing does not work when 
there is no reported profit per se, such as in nonprofit organizations or often in 
the public sector. However, profit sharing may make sense for many organiza￾tions, large or small.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is 
a company-established benefit plan in which employees acquire stock, often 
at below-market prices, as part of their benefits.165 Research on ESOPs indi￾cates they increase firm performance as well as employee satisfaction and 
innovation.166 ESOPs have the potential to increase job satisfaction only when 
employees psychologically experience ownership.167 Even so, ESOPs may 
not inspire lower absenteeism or greater motivation,168 perhaps because the 
employee’s actual monetary benefit comes with cashing in the stock at a later 
date.169 Relatedly, in a study of nearly three thousand Chinese firms, ESOPs 
were not as strongly related with firm performance when combined with execu￾tive stock ownership plans and when employees had no control rights (e.g., no 
“say” in the management of the business).170 Furthermore, a study of nearly 
two thousand European firms suggested that the stock-ownership predicts 
return on investment only when the employees trusted the managers and were 
culturally low on uncertainty avoidance (see the chapter on personality and val￾ues).171 Thus, employees need to be kept regularly informed of the status of 
the business and can have the opportunity to influence it positively to feel moti￾vated toward higher personal performance.172

 ESOPs for top management can reduce unethical behavior. For instance, 
CEOs are less likely to manipulate firm earnings reports to make them￾selves look good in the short run when they have an ownership share. 173
ESOPs are also tools that can be used for community wealth building, such 
as the Cleveland model of networked worker cooperatives in Ohio. 174 Of 
course, not all companies want ESOPs, and they will not work in all situa￾tions, but they can be an important part of an organization’s motivational 
strategy. 
Overall Evaluation of Variable Pay Do variable-pay programs increase moti￾vation and productivity? Generally, yes, but as is clear from our discussion, 
their effectiveness depends on a multitude of considerations. 175 Many orga￾nizations have more than one variable-pay element in operation, such as an 
ESOP and bonuses, so managers should evaluate the effectiveness of the plan 
in terms of the employee motivation gained from each element separately 
and from all elements together. Managers should monitor their employees’ 
 performance-reward expectancy because a combination of elements that 
makes employees feel that their greater performance will yield them greater 
rewards will be the most motivating. 176 Furthermore, executives and managers 
should go to great lengths to anticipate and monitor the justice perceptions 
of employees, taking these ethical considerations to heart when deciding on a 
compensation strategy. 
 An Ethical Choice 
 Workers’ Cooperatives 
Workers’ cooperatives are aimed 
at creating sustainable jobs for 
its owners/workers/members 
in order to generate wealth for their 
local community. Therefore, they dif￾fer from other enterprises in that their 
owners/workers/members seek to 
enhance their capacity to produce and 
serve their needs first, before pursu￾ing profit maximization. Democratically, 
each worker owns one share, and all 
shares are owned by the workers. 
 The basis for the institutionalization 
of the modern cooperative movement 
was established in 1844 on the core 
principle of “one member, one vote,” 
when a group of weavers founded their 
food cooperative, the Rochdale Society 
of Equitable Pioneers, which diversified 
rapidly by opening its own mills and a 
solidary savings fund. Promoting simi￾lar values of benevolent assistance, 
and a pioneer of the cooperative move￾ment, Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen 
founded a German association for 
self-procurement of food during the star￾vation winter of 1846–1847 and cre￾ated the first cooperative lending bank 
in 1864. Today, Raiffeisenbanken and 
the International Raiffeisen Union (IRU) 
are powerful cooperative networks in 
Europe. 
 Employees who can decide how 
to allocate their own resources best, 
with their own considerations of work– 
family balance, are more committed to 
their jobs. As cooperative workers are 
empowered to make such decisions, 
they commit to their work, making their 
cooperatives successful. Additionally, 
cooperatives allow individual mem￾bers to benefit from a pool of collec￾tive resources, allowing them to better 
market their products and negotiate 
prices. Cooperatives help enterprises’ 
creation, development, and sustain￾ability. Striking the balance between 
individual autonomy and common 
responsibility, between capitalism and 
socialism, the cooperative model is 
also sometimes viewed as immune to 
global economic crises. 
 One for all, all for one? Mondragón, 
which employs 80,000 people in 27 
countries, was founded in Spain with the 
ideals of worker participation, solidarity, 
and equality; however, as it grew bigger, 
decision-making became more central￾ized, salary differentials increased, and 
job satisfaction dropped below that of 
employees of similarly sized private￾owned companies—for example, a senior 
manager at Mondragón earns eight times 
the lowest-paid worker in the coopera￾tive. In 2013, when Fagor, one of its con￾stituents, had to declare bankruptcy after 
having run up debts of over €850 million 
($1.2 billion), Mondragón decided not to 
lend Fagor any more money. Almost 5,500 
workers lost their jobs in Spain, France, 
China, Poland, and Morocco. Such issues 
raise key questions: What are the limits 
of cooperative ideals? Is the cooperative 
model just ethical window-dressing for a 
ruthless business to hide behind? 164

Using Benefits to Motivate Employees
Now that we have discussed what and how to pay employees, let’s discuss two 
other motivating factors organizations must decide: (1) what benefits and 
choices to offer (such as flexible benefits) and (2) how to construct employee 
recognition programs. Like pay, benefits are both a provision and a motiva￾tor.177 Employee benefits now make up approximately a third of total compen￾sation costs in organizations.178 Whereas organizations of yesteryear issued a 
standard package to every employee, contemporary leaders understand that 
each employee values benefits differently. A flexible program turns the benefits 
package into a motivational tool.
Flexible Benefits: Developing a Benefits Package
Benefits packages can take on many forms, including health care, retirement sav￾ings, student loan repayment assistance, paid leave, work–life benefits, travel 
assistance, career development, and so on.179 Can we assume that all people 
can benefit from each benefit equally? For instance, would a recently graduated 
college student benefit more from student loan repayment assistance less than 
an employee who graduated from college over ten years ago and already paid 
off all of their loans?
Consistent with motivation theory’s thesis (discussed in the prior chapter) 
that organizational rewards should be linked to each employee’s goals, flex￾ible benefits individualize rewards by allowing each employee to choose the 
compensation package that best satisfies their current needs and situation. 
Flexible benefits can accommodate differences in employee needs based on 
age, marital status, partner’s benefits status, and number and age of depen￾dents. However, it is important to recognize that flexibility does not mean 
that certain benefits are not essential. On the contrary, most managers suggest 
that health care, retirement, and leave are three benefits that are essential 
and should be offered in some way. Compare this with housing assistance and 
travel, which are only rated as slightly important (and, perhaps, best treated 
flexibly).180
Benefits in general can be a motivator for a person to go to work and for a 
person to choose one organization over another. But are flexible benefits more 
motivating than traditional plans? It is difficult to tell. Some organizations that 
have moved to flexible plans report increased employee retention, job satisfac￾tion, and productivity. However, flexible benefits may not substitute for higher 
salaries when it comes to motivation.181 As more organizations worldwide adopt 
flexible benefits, the individual motivation they produce will likely decrease. 
(The plans will be seen as a standard work provision.) In general, the downsides 
of flexible benefit plans may be obvious: They may be costlier to administer, and 
identifying the motivational impact of different provisions is challenging. For 
instance, organizational norms may play a huge role: Even though the company 
may offer benefits, whether employees are encouraged or discouraged from 
using them is a whole other issue.182 In high-pressure work cultures, employees 
may be reluctant to use their vacation days to avoid missing work, falling behind, 
or appearing undedicated to their coworkers. In alignment with social learning 
theory (see the previous chapter), employees may be more likely to model the 
behavior of others in their work environment without considering what is right 
for them as individuals.
Furthermore, recent examinations of benefits programs also present 
an opportunity to demonstrate a commitment to socially responsible 
behavior.183 However, sometimes members of underrepresented groups in 
flexible benefits A benefits plan that allows 
each employee to put together a benefits 
package tailored to their own needs and 
situation.
8-6 Show how flexible benefits 
can motivate employees.
M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 291 14/12/22 4:12 PM292 PART 2 The Individual
organizations also have less access to many important benefits. For instance, 
many people from underrepresented groups are unable to attain full-time 
employment with benefits at the same rate as other groups, leaving them 
without access to important medical benefits along with family and medical 
leave. 184 
 Toward a Better World 
 Sociabble Trees: Rewarding Through 
Reforestation 
 Sociabble is an online social media 
platform used by many organiza￾tions, including Coca-Cola, Microsoft, 
and L’oréal, for internal employee 
communications, social networking, 
collaboration, and performance manage￾ment. Sociabble, for instance, offers a 
social selling dashboard that enables 
employee users to track their progress 
on several key performance indica￾tors, like sales goals, within the app. 
Sociabble recently announced a new 
partnership with Tree-Nation, a non￾profit carbon emissions offset company. 
Tree-Nation enables people to plant 
trees in many locations worldwide to 
offset carbon emissions. Furthermore, 
 Tree-Nation focuses on promoting bio￾diversity by planting different species 
of trees to replenish animal habitats, 
reduce erosion, and improve water qual￾ity. To date, Tree-Nation has worked with 
five thousand companies and planted 
7.7  million trees worldwide, with the 
support of companies like Google, P&G, 
and Unilever. 
 This partnership between the two 
organizations, dubbed Sociabble Trees, 
is unique in that it enables organiza￾tions to compensate employee perfor￾mance through corporate social respon￾sibility (CSR)-relevant rewards (e.g., 
planting trees on their behalf). However, 
other organizations have dabbled in var￾ious forms of CSR-relevant rewards, like 
“voluntourism” (e.g., enabling employ￾ees to see new parts of the world for 
fun while volunteering abroad), CSR￾related “swag” (e.g., T-shirts to com￾memorate their participation in events), 
or company-wide recognition; very few 
have systematically turned toward gift￾ing or donating on the employees’ 
behalf. Sociabble Trees works by gami￾fying day-to-day employee performance: 
For attending meetings, completing 
training, and creating content, among 
other actions, employees are rewarded 
by having trees planted on their behalf. 
Employees can also see where they 
stand in terms of trees planted com￾pared with their coworkers via a lead￾erboard displaying their ranking, trees 
planted, and carbon emissions offset 
to date. Furthermore, Sociabble Trees 
provides a unique sense of signifi￾cance and identity. Employees can see 
a visual depiction of their own “forest” 
and their company’s collective “forest” 
online at any time (made possible, in 
part, by drone photography). 
 Has Sociabble Trees been a suc￾cess so far? Cases of specific compa￾nies using the platform seem to sug￾gest the answer is yes. For instance, 
SmartTrade has seen 80  percent 
company-wide engagement in the pro￾gram and has planted hundreds of 
trees since adopting Sociabble Trees. 
Reena Wahi, senior vice president of 
human resources at Tata Realty, for 
instance, notes, “Sociabble Trees has 
helped us achieve two objectives—
employee engagement and sustain￾ability, both of which are extremely 
important.” Others note that these 
rewards are more meaningful than 
typical rewards. As Geoffroy de la 
Grandière, a director at Adrian, said, 
“In just a few clicks, employees can 
win and plant a tree. It’s something 
much more meaningful than winning 
an iPad.” 
 But does OB science and research 
support the motivational power of CSR￾relevant rewards? To date, not much is 
known about this topic. We do know 
that rewarding executives and employ￾ees for engaging in CSR-related actions 
can be successful in some situations 
(e.g., CEO bonuses tied to corporate 
social performance) and can even be 
activated by intrinsic motivations (e.g., 
a desire to enhance their status and 
reputation). However, the practice is not 
immune to opportunism and gaming 
the system to increase one’s bonus. 
Furthermore, executives and manag￾ers tend to “follow the money” when 
it comes to rewarding for sustainable 
behavior compared with other orga￾nizational goals (e.g., cost-cutting). 
Still, not much research focuses on 
rewarding executives and employees 
with CSR-related rewards. In one study 
that did examine this phenomenon, the 
researchers suggest that employers 
may be inaccurate in assuming that all 
employees value CSR-relevant rewards 
in the same way. Employees who do not 
value environmental sustainability (and, 
perhaps, value different social causes 
more) may not care as much about the 
CSR-related reward and perhaps may 
even find it impersonal. Regardless, 
CSR-relevant rewards are a new fron￾tier in OB research and practice. Future 
research may find additional ways to 
use this technique to make the world a 
better place. 185

Using Intrinsic Rewards to Motivate 
Employees
We have discussed motivating employees through job design and through 
extrinsic rewards. On an organizational level, are those the only ways to 
motivate employees? Not at all! We would be remiss if we overlooked the 
intrinsic rewards that organizations can provide, such as employee recogni￾tion programs, discussed next. Recall from the prior chapter that although
behaviorist approaches suggest that extrinsic rewards can be a powerful moti￾vational force, so too does SDT suggest intrinsic rewards can benefit employee 
motivation.
Employee Recognition Programs
Let’s start with an example. Jaime makes $9.50 per hour working at a fast￾food job in Pensacola, Florida, and the job is not very challenging or inter￾esting. Yet Jaime talks enthusiastically about the job, the supervisor, and the 
company he works for. “What I like is the fact that Carroll, my supervisor, 
appreciates the effort I make. Carroll compliments me regularly in front of 
the other people on my shift, and I have been chosen as Employee of the 
Month twice in the past six months. Did you see my picture on that plaque 
on the wall?”
Organizations are increasingly realizing what Jaime knows: Recognition 
programs and other ways of increasing an employee’s intrinsic motivation 
work. An employee recognition program is a plan to encourage specific behav￾iors by formally appreciating specific employee contributions.186 Employee 
recognition programs range from a spontaneous and private thank-you to 
widely publicized formal programs in which the procedures for attaining rec￾ognition are clearly identified. Many organizations have established employee 
recognition programs, and 59 percent integrate them into their talent man￾agement strategies, with 68 percent noting that the programs positively influ￾ence their retention and 56 percent noting that they positively influence their 
recruitment efforts.187
As companies and government organizations face tighter budgets, nonfi￾nancial incentives become more attractive. Walt Disney World, for example, 
prioritizes employee recognition as a part of its worker engagement strategy. It 
publicly recognizes employees with over a hundred different types of awards. 
The Walt Disney Legacy Award, one of the most prestigious awards, is given 
at a ceremony where peers recognize one employee for outstanding perfor￾mance.188 Multinational corporations like Symantec Corporation, Intuit, and 
Panduit have also increased their use of recognition programs. Companies 
like LinkedIn have enjoyed a whopping 95 percent retention rate for new 
employees due to the Bravo! program administered by Workhuman, a corpo￾ration that offers employee recognition programs.189 Centralized programs 
across multiple offices in different countries can help ensure that all employ￾ees, regardless of where they work, can be recognized for their contribution to 
the work environment.190
Research suggests that financial incentives may be more motivating in the 
short term, but in the long run nonfinancial incentives work best.191 Surprisingly, 
there is not a lot of research on the motivational outcomes or global use of 
employee recognition programs. However, some work indicates that employee 
recognition programs are associated with self-esteem, self-efficacy, and job sat￾isfaction.192 An obvious advantage of recognition programs is that they are

to encourage specific employee behaviors

contributions.

inexpensive: Praise is free!193 With or without financial rewards, they can be 
highly motivating to employees. Despite the increased popularity of such pro￾grams, though, critics argue they are highly susceptible to political manipula￾tion by management. When applied to jobs for which performance factors are 
relatively objective, such as sales, recognition programs are likely to be per￾ceived by employees as fair. In most jobs, however, performance criteria are 
not self-evident, which allows managers to manipulate the system and recog￾nize their favorites. Abuse can undermine the value of recognition programs, 
demoralize employees, and even cause the person recognized to be ostracized. 
As one study showed, once a top performer was recognized, other members of 
the team whose contributions were not recognized may begin to distance them￾selves from that member.194 These members may have unfair procedural justice 
perceptions (see the previous chapter) and begin to ostracize that employee 
as a result. Therefore, where formal recognition programs are used, care must 
be taken to ensure fairness. This might be accomplished by aligning employee 
recognition programs with organizational values and investing in the accuracy 
of the performance management and appraisal process.195 Where they are not, 
it is important to motivate employees by consistently recognizing their perfor￾mance efforts.
Summary
As we have seen in this chapter and the one before it, understanding what mo￾tivates individuals is essential for organizational behavior. In this chapter, we 
described how theory and research are put into practice to enhance employee 
motivation in the workplace. First, we described some of the inherent charac￾teristics of jobs that make them motivating or demotivating, according to the 
job characteristics model (JCM). With knowledge of these characteristics in 
mind, we turned to how jobs can be designed and redesigned to harness their 
motivating potential. Practices like job enrichment, job rotation, and rela￾tional job design were a few such practices that may help accomplish this aim. 
With the advent of COVID-19, the spotlight in the world of work turned toward 
alternative work arrangements and their potential to motivate or demotivate 
employees. In that section, we discussed flextime, job sharing, and telecom￾muting as three significant ways organizations are making alternative work ar￾rangements to the once typical nine-to-five in-person office arrangement. In 
the remainder of the chapter, we discussed how extrinsic rewards (such as 
pay and benefits) and intrinsic rewards motivate employees. Throughout the 
chapter, clear ties between motivation research and application were high￾lighted. To name a few, behaviorism, goal-setting theory, self-determination 
theory, and expectancy theory have appeared to have a substantial impact on 
motivation practice.

Implications for Managers
● Where possible, design and redesign jobs to harness employee motiva￾tion, focusing on the job characteristics model’s elements.
● Consider alternative work arrangements to empower your employees to 
manage their work and home lives. Resist the urge to monitor and control 
employees closely—autonomy and flexibility can be highly motivating.
● Allow employees to participate in decisions that affect them. Employees 
can contribute to setting work goals, choosing their own benefits pack￾ages, and solving productivity and quality problems.
● Link rewards to performance. Rewards should be contingent on perfor￾mance, and employees must perceive the link between the two.
● Check the motivation systems for inequity. Employees should perceive 
that individual effort and outcomes explain differences in pay and other 
rewards.

 CHAPTER REVIEW 
 Gainsharing: Fair Shares? 
POINT 
G
ainsharing is an employment benefit whereby a company’s 
profits are shared with employees based upon their contribu￾tion to the gains that are achieved. Therefore, it is considered 
an incentive to make employees perform their best at work. 
 Employees who know that they will receive financial rewards if the 
company does well have a vested interest in their company’s success. 
Gainsharing reinforces the employees’ feelings of being recognized 
by their employer as responsible for their company’s profitability. It 
gives employees a sense of ownership and accountability. Therefore, 
it empowers employees as they become business partners and feel 
more attached to their employer and adhere better to the company’s 
objectives. 
 As gainsharing is a variable incentive, it seems only fair that 
the better you work, the better you are rewarded. It is also a self￾funded system based on savings generated by improved performance. 
Provided that each individual’s job performance is sufficiently tracked 
and recorded, you can tie individuals’ performance to the company’s 
bottom line. It thus fosters a culture of continuous improvement and 
helps promote positive change. 
 One other positive impact of gainsharing is that it sends the mes￾sage that all of the employees contribute to the company’s success 
and are working together on the same cooperative team toward this 
end. Gainsharing can therefore reinforce group cohesion and a col￾laborative work culture within a company—provided all employees are 
rewarded commensurately. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 Usually, gainsharing plans result in stocks, bonds, or straight 
cash being distributed as a percentage of annual pay; for 
example, 1–2 percent for basic employees and up to 40 
percent for senior executives. Thus, what if a top executive makes 
a critical decision that will increase the company’s profit within a 
year, and by extension their related annual bonus, but with an out￾come that might be detrimental in the long-run? In addition, less 
money is shared with employees in lower-paying jobs, and higher 
amounts in bonuses are shared with highly compensated employ￾ees. Is this fair? 
 The distribution formula behind any gainsharing system is key. 
Each employee needs to identify the extent to which their contribu￾tion really makes an impact, and more particularly, which part of the 
work that they delivered counts the most. Consider when happy, loyal 
patrons leave tips in a restaurant—should waiters share these tips 
with kitchen coworkers, seasonal and extra service staff, and the res￾taurant managers? In what proportion? Ultimately, it is the waiter who 
personalized the service, smiled at the guests, reformulated the order, 
and made upselling suggestions—all ways by which the waiter has 
performed better. Thus, gainsharing requires employees’ participation 
and employers’ transparency regarding performance measures and 
the distribution formula. 
 Finally, because it requires the involvement of all employees, gain￾sharing may increase the level of organizational stress, as everyone 
has more of a financial stake in the company’s success. 196

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
There are many ways in which managers can apply motivation 
theory to concrete applications in organizations. This chapter 
on job design and redesign, alternative work arrangements, 
employee involvement and participation, and rewards and 
benefits is directly applicable to how OB can make you more 
employable. Future managers and professionals can use this 
toolkit in their future work assignments to harness motivation, 
ultimately reduce turnover, improve employee satisfaction 
and retention, and reduce workplace conflict. In this chapter 
so far, you have developed your leadership skills by ponder￾ing whether job crafting can reduce boredom and burnout, 
considered the pros and cons of working during time off in 
flexible work arrangements, examined ethical issues underly￾ing sweatshops and worker safety, and considered how socially 
responsible outcomes can serve as rewards. In this section, 
you will continue to develop these skills, along with your com￾munication and collaboration skills, by working with a group 
to design an organizational development and compensation 
plan for automotive sales consultants, considering how to deal 
with perceived injustice and unfairness in idiosyncratic deals, 
and deciding how to address high turnover and low productiv￾ity as an executive of a large trucking company.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Developing an Organizational Development and 
Compensation Plan for Automotive Sales Consultants
Break the class into groups of three to five.
You are on a team of human resource professionals for a 
new boutique car dealership that specializes in luxury vehi￾cles. You have been tasked with designing an organizational 
development and compensation plan for the team of auto￾motive sales consultants who have just been hired. Using what 
you know about the car sales consultant job (and O*NET, if 
available, for retail salespersons: https://www.onetonline.
org/link/summary/41-2031.00), complete the following and 
answer each question as a group. Assume that the budget is 
moderate in size: not too lavish, not too meager.
Questions
8-8. As a group, consider each of the five job char￾acteristics (skill variety, task identity, task signifi￾cance, autonomy, and feedback). Then write 
down the amount of each characteristic you 
think the automotive sales consultant position 
has. To address each element of the five job 
characteristics (by improving the low elements or 
maintaining the high elements), develop a plan 
for how each characteristic can be improved or 
maintained.
8-9. Next, how important do you think employee 
involvement and participation will be in these 
positions? Develop a plan for how you will 
reasonably plan to include involvement or 
participation in designing these positions. 
Conversely, justify your reasoning for not hav￾ing such a plan.
8-10. Think about what might be important (and rea￾sonable) in terms of compensation for the auto￾motive sales consultants. What types of rewards 
would you provide to the consultants? What type 
of plan would you select? What type of specific 
benefits packages would you make available?
ETHICAL DILEMMA Playing Favorites?
You were promoted to a management position a few months 
ago. You are responsible for leading a team of six people. 
The team has been working well together, which you credit 
to the fact that each member has clearly defined roles. 
However, one team member approaches you to request 
more flexible work hours as they have a young child. You 
know the team member is hardworking and diligent, and 
they assure you that they will continue to keep up with their 
workload. Although everyone on the team has a fixed sched￾ule, you believe this is a reasonable request. Given you know 
the team member well, you approve the flexible schedule.
The following week, it is apparent that everyone on 
the team is aware that you allowed a team member to 
have a flexible schedule. You overhear two team members 
expressing their frustration that there have been some 
communication and coordination issues because of the 
team member’s flexible schedule. They express that they 
wish they had been made aware or consulted about this 
change in the team member’s schedule. Furthermore, 
some insinuate that you were “playing favorites” with this 
team member and that it was not fair to the rest of the team.
Flexible work arrangements or “idiosyncratic deals” 
are becoming more common in the workplace. I-deals 
have several positive benefits, including increased 
motivation and employee loyalty to the organization. 
Further, you are reasonably confident this was a deci￾sion that you were well within your power to make as 
a manager. However, it seems that the I-deal you made 
with one of your employees was not well received by 
your other team members.
M08_ROBB0025_19_GE_C08.indd 297 14/12/22 4:12 PMCASE INCIDENT JP Transport
Kendall Smith, the CEO of the large trucking company JP 
Transport, is faced with a persistent problem. Year after 
year, the company has seen the driver turnover rate con￾tinue to increase. High driver turnover is characteristic of 
the entire trucking industry. Still, Smith is determined to 
find a long-term solution to this problem. In total, turn￾over costs the trucking industry roughly $8 billion annu￾ally. Smith attributes the primary reason for high turnover 
to long hours and requiring employees to be away from 
home for long periods. Smith is concerned that the lost 
productivity is a significant cost for the company.
Smith concludes that these lifestyle factors are simply 
part of the job, and as such, this job might not be the best 
fit for everyone. Unfortunately, these lifestyle factors are 
essential to the job, and truckers can do little to mitigate 
these effects. Instead, Smith proposes that the company 
institute an increase in driver pay. This pay increase would 
offset the job’s less desirable qualities and hopefully at￾tract new drivers looking for a high salary. Smith believes 
the additional personnel costs will be less than the cost of 
unmotivated and thus unproductive drivers. Ultimately, 
Smith thinks a pay increase will lower the turnover rate.
One year later, Kendall Smith is dismayed to find that 
the turnover rate only decreased moderately despite the 
substantial increase in drivers’ salary. Kendall Smith, 
along with other executives at JP Transport, decides to 
gather feedback from current drivers. This feedback will 
enable them to understand the challenges better, includ￾ing which challenges are most likely to lead drivers to 
leave the job. Following are a few examples of the feed￾back received from current drivers surveyed.
Luis (Driving for Seven Years)
“I love my job! I know many people might be surprised by that 
from the outside, but I think JP does a good job of making people 
feel a part of a community. You get to know the other drivers, even 
if you do not see them that often. The company also makes you feel 
like what you’re doing matters. Even though it is hard to see because 
we’re sort of behind the scenes, truckers play a big role in helping 
keep the country running with all of the supplies we deliver.”
Cameron (Driving for Fifteen Years)
“I have been in this job for a while, so there are some things 
that I like about it. It is pretty decent pay for not having a col￾lege education. I never liked the idea of working a desk job, so 
the fact that I get to see different parts of the country and I am 
not stuck in an office is a pretty decent perk of the job. Over 
the years, though, I’ve seen there’s more and more regulation. 
When I started, it was nice because I didn’t have some manager 
hovering over my shoulder, telling me what to do. Now there are 
these ELDs [electronic logging devices] that keep track of driv￾ing hours. I mean, I know there’s not much the company can do 
about that because the government mandated it. Still, it means 
less flexibility and pay for me. I can only work fourteen hours a 
day. I spend three of those hours at the shipping dock, and I do 
not get paid unless I’m driving. I know they’re trying to make it 
safer and prevent accidents, but it’d be nice if I could get paid 
for those hours or at least not have them counted toward my 
hours.”
Shelby (Driving for Five Years)
“So, obviously, there are not a whole lot of women driving 
trucks, but I like it pretty much. I like driving and having the 
freedom ‘to be my own boss.’ I always want to try to do the job 
better and faster than before. As far as challenges, I will say I’ve 
had to deal with my fair share of rude comments and gross behav￾ior. First off, the men are rather skeptical of a female driver, so it’s 
not the most welcoming for women, and it’s like I have to prove 
myself all the time. Truck stops are just not a place you want to be 
because there are a lot of sketchy things that go on there.”
Terrell (Driving for Three Years)
“Wow, I cannot believe it has only been three years. It feels 
like twenty! Probably no surprise, but this job is incredibly 
boring and monotonous. If I have to hear some of these talk 
shows and music again, I will lose it. After a while, even 
listening to the radio, podcasts, and audiobooks can’t make it 
interesting. I want to find a job where variety is a good thing, 
unlike the trucking industry. Anything out of the ordinary, 
like a roadblock, for example, almost always ends up being a 
headache.”

 CONFRONTING DEVIANT NORMS 
Even though 90 percent of McDonald’s U.S. locations are franchisee-owned, 
recent reports demonstrate a widespread pattern of discrimination, 
harassment, and abuse throughout the organization. A poll in 2020 found 
that 76 percent of 782 female workers surveyed had experienced at least 
one form of harassment while working at McDonald’s. Many employees 
described being victims of harassment such as inappropriate touching 
and lewd comments. They followed through by reporting these incidents 
to franchisee managers, but not enough was done to address and prevent 
these issues from occurring again. In fact, 71 percent of employees surveyed 
reported facing punishment after reporting incidents of harassment. The CEO 
of McDonald’s, Chris Kempczinski, announced that the company developed 
a set of “Global Brand Standards” in response to the allegations. These 
standards were written to ensure employees understand the expectations 
for safe and respectful workplace behavior. 
 Despite progress made through the #MeToo movement to stop sexual 
harassment and abuse, the restaurant industry continues to be plagued by 
issues of harassment. In this industry, a staggering 90 percent of women 
and 70 percent of men experience some form of harassment. The power 
dynamics between managers, supervisors, and frontline workers in the 
restaurant industry can create an environment (like those described by 
McDonald’s employees) in which sexual harassment is ignored, tolerated, or 
normalized. As harassment comes to be considered a norm in a particular 
franchise or location, employees often do not feel comfortable confronting 
these individuals about their behavior.

M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 301 13/12/22 2:51 AM302 PART 3 The Group
The restaurant industry has other norms that contribute to the prevalence 
of harassment. A familiar saying, “The customer is always right,” continues 
to be praised in the industry. However, norms that glorify the customer in this 
way may devalue and ignore the employee experience. For instance, studies 
show that service employees face harassment and mistreatment from 
customers daily but often do not report these incidents. Managers may also 
perceive sexual harassment as less harmful when exhibited by a customer 
rather than by an employee. Furthermore, restaurant employees’ reliance 
on tips means that customers play an influential role in the evaluation and 
compensation of these employees. In a culture that emphasizes and rewards 
appearance, customers can further use this to justify their harassment of 
employees. As a result, restaurant workers are often more vulnerable to 
sexual harassment.
The question then is how can McDonald’s and the restaurant industry 
ensure that these expectations for appropriate behavior become norms 
that are ingrained in their cultures? Bystander-intervention training shows 
promising results. It helps individuals who witness the harassment become 
allies in identifying and assisting the individuals who experience it. Training 
has also shown promise as it teaches managers and employees how to 
recognize, address, and confront harassment and inform them on the issue’s 
seriousness. Furthermore, these strategies can help employees recognize 
that they all play a role in eliminating harmful norms and that these behaviors 
negatively impact the work environment for everyone.1
As individuals, we all belong to groups based on our occupations, organizations, 
departments, and many other categories. When we are part of a group, it 
changes our perception of the situation. The objective of this chapter is to set a 
foundation for understanding groups in the context of organizational behavior 
(OB). With this foundation in place, in the next chapter we describe work teams 
in organizations. As we unpack in the upcoming chapter on work teams, many
consider groups and teams to be different concepts.2
 Groups do not need to 
collaborate and coordinate to meet group objectives—teams, on the other hand, 
need to collaborate and coordinate synergistically to achieve their goals. In this 
chapter, we turn toward familiarizing you with group concepts, showing you how 
groups form, interact, and make decisions, and outlining the characteristics that 
define groups. But first, let us begin by defining a group.
Defining and Classifying Groups
In OB, a group is two or more individuals, interacting and interdependent, 
who have come together to achieve certain objectives. For example, consider 
a sales group from a regional office of a large insurance company: The group 
is responsible for selling insurance to local citizens, and each person on the 
team has come together to sell insurance for their organization.3
 We belong to 
many groups throughout our lifetime, but some are more salient than others 
9-1 Distinguish between the 
different types of groups.
group Two or more individuals, interacting 
and interdependent, who have come together 
to achieve particular objectives.
M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 302 13/12/22 2:51 AMFoundations of Group Behavior CHAPTER 9 303
at certain times, and some group roles can even come into conflict (e.g., the 
demands of being a parent can collide with those of being a manager).4
Groups can be either formal or informal. A formal group is defined by the 
organization’s structure, with designated work assignments and established 
tasks. In formal groups, the behaviors that team members should engage in 
are stipulated by and directed toward organizational goals. The members of 
an airline flight crew are a formal group, for example. In contrast, an informal 
group is neither formally structured nor organizationally determined and often 
meets to fulfill social needs or to bind employees with common interests. Three 
employees from different departments who regularly have lunch or coffee 
together are an informal group. These types of interactions among individuals, 
though informal, deeply affect their behavior and performance.
Social Identity
People often feel strongly about their groups, partly because shared experiences 
amplify our perception of events and can increase our sense of a bond with and 
trust toward others.5
 For example, consider Tom’s Marine Sales, a local busi￾ness in Crawfordsville, Indiana.6
 Celebrating its 50th anniversary, the company 
threw a party with the owners’ closest friends and employees in attendance. 
The employees not only appreciate the history of the company and identify 
with its successes and losses (including the loss of Tom’s wife and the company’s 
cofounder, Joy) but also identify as a part of the Crawfordsville community. In 
fact, the mayor and county commissioners were on hand to present Tom’s with a 
plaque to commemorate its service to the community. Our tendency to person￾ally invest in the accomplishments of a group can be explained by social identity 
theory, which is in many ways a complementary concept to social categorization
discussed in the chapter on diversity. Social categorization explains why peo￾ple categorize others as belonging to different groups, whereas social identity 
explains why people identify with particular groups.
Social identity theory proposes that people have emotional reactions to the 
failure or success of their group because their self-esteem gets tied to whatever 
happens to the group.7
 Employees might feel proud at the company’s suc￾cesses, feel angry and threatened when the company is threatened, or even feel 
schadenfreude (i.e., pleasure due to another’s misfortune) when competitors suf￾fer.8
 Wendy’s social media group, for example, harnesses these emotions with 
formal group A designated work group 
defined by an organization’s structure.
informal group A group that is not defined 
by an organization’s structure; such a group 
appears in response to other needs, such as 
social clubs or interest groups.
social identity theory Perspective that 
considers when and why individuals consider 
themselves members of groups.

Jeffrey Webster, director of human 
resources at a Nissan plant in 
Mississippi, also serves as the direc￾tor of the plant’s gospel choir. Choir 
members are a diverse group of em￾ployees who identify with each other 
because they all share a love of sing￾ing and performing for fellow workers, 
company executives, state officials, 
and community events.

Twitter “roasting wars” with fast-food rivals (sassy put-downs of other companies 
and their products).9
 Twitter fans and employees of Wendy’s alike feel especially 
proud and identify with the company when Wendy’s “burns” a competitor. Job 
applicants may also be more attracted to organizations that match with their 
own social identities. For instance, one study found that engineering job seek￾ers were more attracted to LinkedIn job postings that conveyed social identities 
that fit with their own.10 The same holds for “gig workers”: People attracted to 
these occupations and who prefer them tend to prefer employment relation￾ships that are more transactional and less social or emotional.11
People develop many identities through the course of their lives, and many 
of these cluster together (e.g., your extended family may also worship at the 
same temple or your coworkers may also be gym buddies).12 You might define 
yourself in terms of the organization you work for, the city you live in, your pro￾fession, your religious background, your ethnicity, and/or your gender, among 
other characteristics. Over time, some groups you belong to may become more 
significant to you than others. A U.S. expatriate working in Rome might be 
very aware of being from the United States, for instance, but might not give 
national identity a second thought when transferring from Tulsa to Tucson.13
On another note, an expatriate who has worked in dozens of countries over the 
decades may even begin to identify as an international cosmopolitan!14 Some 
of our social identities may be more or less salient in any given situation, or we 
may find that our social identities are in conflict, as described at the beginning 
of this section.15 Regardless, these identity changes and transformations (e.g., 
maintaining, acquiring, or even losing identities) can have a drastic effect on 
people’s health and well-being.16
Within our organizations and groups, we develop many identities through 
(1) relational identification, when we connect with others because of our 
roles, and (2) collective identification, when we connect with the aggregate 
characteristics of our groups. In the workplace, our identification with our 
groups is stronger than with our organizations (recall our discussion of 
organizational identification from the chapter on job attitudes), but both are 
important to positive outcomes in attitudes and behaviors.17 If we have low 
identification with a group, we may experience decreased satisfaction and 
engage in fewer organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs; see our descrip￾tion in the introductory chapter).18 Immigrant workers, for example, often 
experience strained and threatened identities when they do not have inclu￾sive, supportive supervisors or when they do not feel like they are a part of 
the local community. This often leads to high turnover rates for immigrants 
and migrants.19 Even the words leaders use matter—when CEOs use we or 
us language (instead of I language), this signals to employees and stakehold￾ers alike that they are a part of a group. For instance, one study spanning 
sixteen years found that use of this collective language was correlated with 
increased sales and return on investment.20
As we described in the chapter on diversity, social categorization (and social 
identity) processes can sometimes lead people to think of people who share 
their social identity as the ingroup and people from different groups as outgroups.
In the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations, we described 
how this can be a strong source of prejudice and discrimination. People fall 
into the dangerous trap of believing that those who belong to different out￾groups are “all the same,” contributing to the polarization of people.21 On the 
other hand, we tend to “play favorites” or see our ingroup as better than other 
people. For example, some research suggests that favoritism and not hostility 
might cause most discriminatory behaviors: “Hostility isn’t integral to the defi￾nition of discrimination; you can treat people differently without being hostile 
to anyone.”22 By playing favorites with their own ingroup (e.g., people of the 
M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 304 13/12/22 2:51 AMFoundations of Group Behavior CHAPTER 9 305
same race/ethnicity, gender identity, etc.), employees and managers alike may 
be complicit in discrimination.
Now that we have learned about groups as entities and why they form 
(through social identification), we move next to discuss the group “life cycle”: 
how groups form, interact, and disperse.
Stages of Group Development
Temporary groups with finite deadlines pass through a unique sequencing 
of actions (or inaction) called the punctuated-equilibrium model, shown in 
Exhibit 9-1:
1. The first meeting sets the group’s direction.
2. The first phase of group activity is one of inertia and thus makes slower 
progress.
3. A transition takes place when the group has used up half its allotted time.
4. This transition initiates major changes.
5. A second phase of inertia follows the transition.
6. The group’s last meeting is characterized by markedly accelerated activity.23
At the first meeting, the group’s general purpose and direction are set. 
Then the group establishes a framework of assumptions and principles to 
which the group will conform. (Sometimes, these assumptions are implicit 
and automatic—formed in the first few seconds of the group’s existence.) 
Once set, the group’s direction is solidified and is unlikely to be reexam￾ined throughout the first half of its life. This is a period of inertia—the 
group tends to stand still or become locked into a fixed course of action, 
even if it gains new insights that challenge initial patterns and assumptions. 
Groups experience a transition halfway between the first meeting and the 
official deadline—whether members spent an hour on their project or six 
months. The midpoint appears to work like an alarm clock, heightening 
members’ awareness that their time is limited and that they need to get 
moving. This transition ends the first phase and is characterized by a con￾centrated burst of changes, dropping of old patterns, and adoption of new 
perspectives. The transition sets a revised direction for the next phase, in 
which the group executes plans created during the transition period. The 
group’s last meeting is characterized by a final burst of activity to finish its 
work.

development.

There are many models of group stages, but the punctuated-equilibrium 
model tends to be a dominant theory with strong support. Keep in mind, how￾ever, that this model does not apply to all groups but is suited to the finite 
quality of temporary task groups working under a time deadline.24 Alternative 
models suggest that teams progress through a formation stage, a conflict resolu￾tion or “storming” stage, a “norming” stage where members agree on roles and 
make decisions, and a “performing” stage where members begin to work col￾laboratively. The forming, storming, norming, and performing stages may occur 
at phase one of the punctuated-equilibrium model, while a second performing 
and conforming stage may occur in the second phase, following a short period 
of reforming group norms and expectations.25
Apart from the identity bestowed by group membership and the ways in 
which groups are formed, there are several other defining properties that are 
important to understanding groups in organizations: roles, norms, status, size, 
and cohesion. We will discuss each in the sections that follow.
Group Property 1: Roles
The Independent Group was formed after eleven British members of Parliament 
(MPs) resigned from their political parties, forming a new group dedicated to 
reaching across party divides to further centrist political interests in the UK.26
Although the group ultimately dissolved after the eleven were not reelected, 
each member of the group brought something different to the table. As another 
example, in the Ocean’s movie series, each con artist had a different role in 
contributing to pulling off the heist (e.g., the “drivers,” the “electronics,” the 
“traps,” the “grease,” etc.). All group members play a role, a function assumed 
by someone occupying a given position in a group.
We all take on several diverse roles, both at work and in life (e.g., partner, 
parent, poker champion, editor, professor). Different groups impose different 
role requirements on individuals. Many of these roles are compatible; some 
create conflicts. For example, if you were offered a job in Phoenix, but your 
family wanted to stay in Orlando, could the partner-parent-professional role 
demands be reconciled? Furthermore, how do we come to understand others’ 
role requirements? We draw on our role perceptions to frame our ideas of appro￾priate behaviors and to learn the expectations of our groups. We also seek to 
understand the parameters of our roles to minimize role conflict. Let us discuss 
each of these facets.
Role Perception
Our view of how we are supposed to act in a given situation is a role perception. 
We get role perceptions from stimuli all around us (e.g., our family, our cowork￾ers, YouTube, etc.). For example, working, married parents identify strongly 
with their family roles and positively translate these roles into work roles, such 
as their leadership expectations.27 However, research on U.S. marines suggests 
that even though some role perceptions do translate from context to context, 
some stay limited to their respective context (with marines “protecting” their 
work roles from becoming a part of their family life, for example).28
Role Expectations
Role expectations are the way others believe you should act in a given context. 
A U.S. federal judge is viewed as having propriety and dignity, while a football 
coach may be seen as aggressive, dynamic, and inspiring to the players. Role

expectations influence role perceptions. For instance, if a supervisor expects 
their employee to innovate in their role, the employee is more likely to believe 
that creativity and innovation are a part of their role (even if it is not formally 
defined as such).29 Similarly, leaders’ voice and actions surrounding ethical 
issues influence the ethical role perceptions of followers.30 Role expectations 
are also often emotionally and motivationally charged. For instance, supervisors 
may perceive employees’ roles more optimistically than the employees them￾selves, in which case the pessimistic employees may exhibit diminished work 
engagement and performance.31 A supervisor may be incredibly optimistic and 
excited to provide excellent customer service during tomorrow’s big sale—the 
employees, on the other hand, might not share this same optimism.
In the workplace, we often look at role expectations through the perspec￾tive of the psychological contract: an unwritten agreement that exists between 
employees and employers (including senior management, supervisors, cowork￾ers, recruiters, and gig workers) that establishes mutual expectations.32 Although 
the terms of the psychological contract can change over time,33 in general, 
management is expected to treat employees fairly, provide acceptable working 
conditions, clearly communicate what is a fair day’s work, and give feedback on 
how well employees are doing. Employees are expected to demonstrate a good 
attitude, follow directions, and show loyalty to the organization. Unfortunately, 
employees can even be expected to be unethical by their employers—if they do 
not comply, they are often met with sanctions (e.g., insults, pressure) and may 
be perceived as being less warm.34
What happens if management does not fulfill its part of the bargain? We 
can expect negative effects on employee performance, counterproductive work 
behavior (CWB), turnover, and dissatisfaction.35 Conversely, if management ful￾fills its part of the bargain, employees are likely to feel grateful, identify with 
their organization, and be more willing to go above and beyond by performing 
OCBs.36 Why might employees not play their part? Loss of resources, workload, 
stress (e.g., family interfering with work), a sense of wanting more than what the 
contract can offer, and other obstacles can limit the extent to which employees 
can fulfill their part of the bargain, causing their performance at work to suffer 
and them to be potentially passed up for promotions.37 However, sometimes 
perceptions of our own and others’ obligations can be tricky and complicate 
the situation. For instance, some employers who are “overly supportive” may

make employees nervous, causing them to feel they are obligated to do more in 
their role for their employer. 38 To deal with the complexity and reduce contract 
violations, both the physical and psychological contracts of gig workers tend to 
become more broad and less specific over time. 39
 Of course, the trust can be repaired between the two if either does not 
fulfill its part of the contract. For instance, some research suggests that for￾giveness can help relieve emotional exhaustion following the breach of a psy￾chological contract. 40 If you were the person who violated the contract, do not 
deny that the breach ever occurred (and take responsibility) if you want to 
rebuild trust. 41 
 Role Conflict 
 When compliance with one role makes it difficult to comply with another, the 
result is role conflict . 
42 At the extreme, two or more roles may be clashing, like 
when professors are expected to be excellent teachers and researchers when 
they normally only have enough time to perform one of the roles well. 43
 Similarly, we can experience interrole conflict when the expectations of 
the different groups we belong to are in opposition. 44 As a primary example, 
many people hold multiple jobs, perhaps one that is primary (e.g., software 
engineer) and a secondary job (e.g., guitarist in a metal band). These jobs 
might inevitably come into conflict, and indeed, research shows that jobs 
like this can interfere with the primary job. 45 As a more common example, 
family/life roles can often conflict with work roles. 46 One American mother 
described how she was “scrambling after her son was born to accomplish two 
tasks: ‘knitting back together’ from her C-section and assembling a patchwork 
of enough disability leave, vacation and sick days, and unpaid time off, to rest 
briefly and care for her infant son before returning to work.” 47 As another

 Myth or Science? Gossip and Exclusion Are Toxic for Groups 
T
he preceding statement is not 
necessarily true, but it is coun￾terintuitive. Let’s explore the 
conditions. What is gossip? Most of us 
might say gossip is talking about oth￾ers, sharing rumors, and speculating 
about others’ behaviors; gossip affects 
a person’s reputation. We might also 
say gossip is malicious, but according 
to researchers, it can serve positive 
social functions, too. Prosocial gos￾sip can expose behavior that exploits 
other people, which can lead to positive 
changes. For example, if Jules tells Chris 
that Alex is bullying Summer, then Chris 
has learned about Alex’s poor behavior 
through gossiping. Chris might refuse 
to partner with Alex on a work project, 
which might limit Alex’s opportunities 
with the organization, preventing Alex 
from bullying more people. Alternatively, 
as the gossip spreads, Alex might feel 
exposed and vulnerable and conform 
to group expectations against bullying 
behavior. In fact, according to research, 
Alex is likely to cooperate with the group 
in response to the gossip, and others 
hearing and spreading the gossip are 
likely also to cooperate by not acting on 
their impulses toward bad behavior. 
 What about excluding Alex? There 
are two types of exclusion in the work￾place: leaving someone out of a group 
and ostracizing an individual. Both lead 
to the same end—the person is not 
part of the group. While simply leav￾ing someone out of a group might not 
send a message of exclusion, ostracism 
certainly does. Ostracism is more of a 
felt punishment than gossip because it 
is more direct. Research indicates that 
ostracized individuals cooperate to a 
greater degree when they are around the 
group to show a willingness to conform, 
hoping to be invited back into the group. 
 Can gossip and ostracism work 
together? Yes, according to one study. 
When subjects were given an opportu￾nity to gossip about the work of another 
subject, that subject cooperated more 
than before; when the opportunity 
to gossip was paired with the ability to 
ostracize, that subject cooperated 
to a much greater degree. Thus, gossip 
and exclusion may provide groups with 
benefits, at least when the gossip is 
confined to truthful work-related discus￾sion, when the opportunity still exists to 
rejoin the group with full standing, and 
when the group norms are positive. 54

example, nurses may unexpectedly find themselves in a disaster (e.g., a hur￾ricane or mass shooting) where they are required to calmly provide aid for 
someone (their professional role) who is close to them, regulating emotions 
they are experiencing that stem from their attachment to that person (the 
relational role).48
Indeed, research demonstrates that role conflict is a significant source of 
stress for most employees.49 Furthermore, during mergers and acquisitions, 
employees can be torn between their identities as members of their original 
organization and of the new parent company.50 Multinational organizations 
have also been shown to lead to dual identification—with the local division and 
with the international organization.51 Although the typical function of role con￾flict is to be a major stressor that is difficult to balance, some employees do find 
creative ways of coping and adjusting to the conflict, especially when they adopt 
a mindfulness mindset (see the chapter on stress and health).
52 Furthermore, 
managers can be of help by providing the support employees need to do their 
jobs, especially for newer employees experiencing the competing demands of 
doing their job and “learning the ropes.”53
Group Property 2: Norms
San Francisco startup Gusto designed its office as if it were a living room, with a 
“no shoes” policy (although sandals and slippers are permitted, if you must).55
Why do we wear shoes indoors to begin with, and why do we take them off 
in some environments (Gusto, some people’s houses) and not in others (Best 
Buy)? The answer can be found in norms.
All groups have established norms—acceptable standards of behavior shared 
by members that express what they ought to do and ought not to do under 
certain circumstances. Different groups, communities, and societies have dif￾ferent norms, but they all have them.56 Norms are not just leader-established, 
opinion-driven policies: For them to be adopted (and not abandoned after 
three days), they need to be accepted by all.57
Let us discuss the levels of influence that norms can exert over us, starting 
with our emotions.
Norms and Emotions
The emotions of group members, especially those who work together daily, can 
amplify the power of norms. Coworkers, for example, may react negatively to 
you coming in sick for work and may be angry and uncivil toward you.58 Norms 
can even dictate the experience of emotions for the individuals and for their 
groups—in other words, people grow to interpret their shared emotions in the 
same way.59 For example, team members experience moral emotions (see the 
chapter on emotion and moods) as a result of perspective-taking within the con￾text of their group’s norms, leading employees to respond to ethical situations 
in different ways (e.g., acting with sympathy/compassion, derogating unethical 
behavior, or trying to make the situation right).60
Norms and Conformity
As a member of a group, you desire acceptance and stability. Thus, you may con￾form to group norms when you perceive that others are doing so.61 Considerable 
evidence suggests that groups can place strong pressures to change to match the 
group’s standards.62 The impact that group pressures for conformity can have 
on an individual member’s judgment was demonstrated in studies by Solomon

M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 309 13/12/22 2:51 AM310 PART 3 The Group
Asch and others.63 Asch formed groups of seven or eight people who were asked 
to compare two cards. One card had one line, and the other had three lines of 
varying length, one of which was identical to the line on the one-line card, as 
Exhibit 9-2 shows. The difference in line length was obvious; in fact, participants 
were incorrect less than 1 percent of the time in announcing which of the three 
lines matched the single line.
The experiment began with two rounds of matching exercises, in which 
each participant was called upon to match the card to its identical counterpart. 
Everyone gave the right answers. On the third round, however, the first partici￾pant, who was part of the research team, gave an obviously wrong answer—for 
example, saying “C” in Exhibit 9-2. The next participant, also on the research 
team, gave the same wrong answer, and so forth. Now the dilemma confronting 
the participant, who did not know the others were on the research team, was 
this: publicly state a perception that differed from the position of the others or 
give an incorrect answer that agreed with the others.
The results over many experiments showed 75 percent of subjects gave at 
least one answer that conformed—that they knew was wrong but was consis￾tent with the replies of other group members—and the average conformer 
gave wrong answers 37  percent of the time. This suggests we feel pressure 
to conform with group norms.64 But does that mean we are mere robots? 
Certainly not. We do not tend to like the pressure we feel to conform. Asch 
wrote, “Those who participated in this challenging experiment agreed nearly 
without exception that independence was preferable to conformity.”65 Do 
individuals conform to the pressures of all groups to which they belong? 
Again, obviously not. When they do conform, it is most likely to their refer￾ence groups, important groups in which people are aware of other members, 
define themselves as members or would like to be members, and feel group 
members are significant. Conformity effects are not always bad: For example, 
people can conform to prosocial norms, such as generosity in donating, and 
can even feel more empathy as a result.66
Norms and Behavior
Norms can cover any aspect of group behavior.67 As we have mentioned, norms 
in the workplace significantly influence employee behavior. This may seem intu￾itive, but full appreciation of the influence of norms on worker behavior did not 
occur until the Hawthorne Studies conducted between 1924 and 1932 at the 
Western Electric Company’s Hawthorne Works in Chicago.68
In the studies, the researchers first examined the relationship between the phys￾ical environment—specifically, the amount of light on the shop floor—and pro￾ductivity. As they increased the light level for the experimental group of workers, 
reference groups Important groups to 
which individuals belong or hope to belong. 
People are motivated to conform to and 
adopt the norms of these groups.

output rose for that unit and the control group. But as they dropped the light level, 
productivity continued to increase. In fact, productivity in the experimental group 
decreased only when the light intensity had been reduced to that of moonlight, 
leading researchers to believe that group dynamics, rather than the environment, 
influenced behavior.
The researchers next isolated a small group of women assembling telephones 
so their behavior could be observed more carefully. Over the next several years, 
this small group’s output increased steadily, and the number of personal and 
sick absences was approximately one-third of that in the regular production 
department. It became evident that this group’s performance was significantly 
influenced by its “special” status. The members thought they were in an elite 
group and that management showed concern about their interests by engaging 
in experimentation. In essence, workers in both the illumination and assembly 
experiments were really reacting to the increased attention they received.
Finally, the researchers implemented a wage incentive plan for employees in 
the bank wiring observation room. The most important finding was that employ￾ees did not individually maximize their output. Rather, their role performance 
became controlled by a group norm. Members were afraid that if they signifi￾cantly increased their output, the unit incentive rate might be cut, the expected 
daily output might be increased, layoffs might occur, or slower workers might 
be reprimanded. So the group established its idea of a fair output—neither 
too much nor too little. Members helped each other ensure their reports were 
nearly level, and the norms that the group established included a number of 
behavioral “don’ts.” Don’t be a rate-buster—turning out too much work. Don’t be 
a chiseler—turning out too little work. Don’t squeal on any of your peers. The 
group enforced its norms with name calling, ridicule, and even punches to the 
upper arms of violators. It thus operated well below its capability, using norms 
that were tightly established and strongly enforced.
Positive Norms and Group Outcomes
Positive group norms may well beget positive outcomes, but only if other factors 
are present, too. Overall, evolutionary explanations of norms suggest they were 
developed so that we can observe positive outcomes: For example, groups fac￾ing a high degree of threat develop strong interaction and cooperation norms 
as well as norms to punish deviants.69 This may be why we observe differences in 
cultural norms across the globe.
As an example of the positive effect of positive norms, one goal of every 
organization with corporate social responsibility (CSR; see the introductory 
chapter) initiatives is for the organization’s values (or the values of the CEO 
and executives) to hold normative sway over employees.70 After all, if employ￾ees aligned their thinking with the organization’s positive norms, these norms 
would become stronger, and the probability of positive impact would grow 
exponentially. Some research in Germany indicates that this may be a function 
of how satisfied people are with their groups, with more satisfied employees 
more likely to adopt the CSR norms.71
However, norms that may appear to be positive and functional on the sur￾face may lead to undesirable outcomes. One study of firefighters and nurses 
found that even though family-friendly benefits were intended to be used and 
effectively reduce work–family conflict, workers were less likely to use these 
benefits if they perceived that others in their work group did not use them.72
Interestingly, some research also suggests that when trying to promote diversity 
in the workplace, raising awareness for the prevalence of stereotyping can back￾fire and can actually lead to more stereotype-consistent behavior.73
M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 311 13/12/22 2:51 AM312 PART 3 The Group
 Negative Norms and Group Outcomes 
As we discussed in the introductory chapter, unethical behavior (sometimes 
referred to as deviance and also simultaneously a CWB ; see the chapter on job 
attitudes ) is voluntary behavior that violates norms and, in so doing, threatens 
the well-being of the organization or its members. Exhibit 9- 3 provides a typol￾ogy of unethical or deviant behaviors, with examples of each. Negative norms 
operate to facilitate poor group outcomes and deviant behavior. As some exam￾ples, group member and supervisor absences set the tone for the office: If team 
members do not show up and if the supervisor does not show up, most employ￾ees will probably not show up. 74 The OB Poll illustrates some of the most com￾mon forms of unethical, deviant behavior in organizations. 
 Few organizations will admit to creating or condoning conditions that 
encourage and maintain deviant behaviors. Yet they exist. For one, as we dis￾cussed before, a work group can become characterized by positive or negative 
attributes. When those attributes are negative, unethical or deviant behaviors 
may be observed more frequently: As some researchers suggest, “bad apples” 
come from “bad barrels.” 75 Second, employees can be mistreated by their 
supervisors, their coworkers, and even their customers, which can cause them to 
engage in unethical behaviors as a result. 76 Mistreatment of this type is impor￾tant to organizational retention efforts, as nearly half of employees who have 
suffered this incivility say that it has led them to think about changing jobs; 
12 percent actually quit because of it. 77 Finally, as organizations have tried to 
do more with less, pushing their employees to work extra hours, they may be 
indirectly facilitating deviant behavior. 78

Like norms in general, employees’ antisocial actions are shaped by the 
group context within which they work. Evidence demonstrates deviant work￾place behavior is likely to flourish where it is supported by group norms.79 For 
example, workers who socialize either at or outside work with people who are 
frequently absent from work are more likely to be absent themselves.80 Thus, 
when deviant workplace norms surface, employee cooperation, commitment, 
and motivation are likely to suffer.
What are the consequences of workplace deviance for groups? Some research 
suggests a chain reaction occurs in groups with high levels of dysfunctional 
behavior.81 The process begins with negative behaviors like shirking, undermin￾ing coworkers, or being generally uncooperative. As a result of these behaviors, 
the group collectively starts to have negative moods. These negative moods then 
result in poor coordination of effort and lower levels of group performance.
Norms and Culture
Do people in collectivist cultures have different norms than people in individualist 
cultures? Of course they do—even to the extent that some norms are undetectable 
or not understood by outgroup members.82 But did you know that our orientation 
may be momentarily changed within a group context, even after years of living in 
one society? In one study, an organizational role-playing exercise was given to a 
neutral group of subjects; the exercise stressed either collectivist or individualist 
norms. Subjects were then given a task of their personal choice or were assigned 
one by an ingroup or outgroup person. When the individualist-primed subjects 
were allowed personal choice of the task or the collectivist-primed subjects were 
assigned the task by an ingroup person, they became more highly motivated.83
Regardless of these temporary shifts, cultural norms can affect many behav￾iors in the workplace, such as what negotiation strategy to select. (Aggressive 
strategies are more often used in honor and face cultures, like Qatar and China, 
relative to dignity cultures like the United States.)84 The negotiation results are 
surprising, considering that employees in Asian cultures value harmony and 
cooperation in interpersonal interactions but will do what they can to compete 
and save face in professional contexts. Cultural norms can even influence how 
people respond to those who violate the norm. For instance, norm violators in

Group Property 3: Status and Group 
Property 4: Size and Dynamics
Have you ever noticed how groups tend to stratify into higher- and lower-status 
members? Sometimes the status of members reflects their status outside the 
group setting, but not always. Groups can also vary by size in ways that affect 
members’ behaviors, dynamics, and group outcomes. Let us examine how these 
factors affect a work group’s efficacy.
Group Property 3: Status
Status—a socially defined position or rank given to groups or group members 
by others—permeates every society.86 Even the smallest group shows differences 
in member status over time. Status is a significant motivator and has major 
behavioral consequences when individuals perceive a disparity between what 
they believe their status is and what others perceive it to be.
What Determines Status? According to status characteristics theory, status 
tends to derive from one of three sources:87
1. The power a person wields over others. Because they likely control the 
group’s resources, people who control group outcomes tend to be per￾ceived as high status.
2. A person’s ability to contribute to a group’s goals. People whose contribu￾tions are critical to the group’s success tend to have high status.
3. An individual’s personal characteristics. Someone whose personal charac￾teristics are positively valued by the group (good looks, intelligence, money, 
or a friendly personality) typically has higher status than someone with 
fewer valued attributes.
Status and Norms High-status individuals may be more likely to deviate from 
norms when they have low identification (social identity) with the group.88 They 
also eschew pressure from lower-ranking members of other groups. For instance, 
physicians actively resist administrative decisions made by lower-ranking medi￾cal insurance company employees.89 High-status people are also better able to 
resist conformity pressures than their lower-status peers. An individual who is 
highly valued by a group but does not need or care about the group’s social 
rewards is particularly able to disregard conformity norms.90 In general, bring￾ing high-status members into a group may improve performance, but only up 
to a point, perhaps because these members may introduce counterproductive 
norms.91 For instance, high-status employees in organizations may be more 
likely to justify unethical behaviors as necessary and ethical, doing less to reject 
unethical practices on principle.92 They do not control everything, though: 
Gossip can both confer status and damage reputations.93
Status and Group Interaction People tend to become more assertive when 
they seek to attain higher status in a group,94 especially when they are already 
of higher status in other groups.95 They speak out more often, criticize 
more, give more commands, use more jargon to sound proficient, do more

favors for others, and interrupt others more often.96 Conversely, some evi￾dence suggests that those who do have higher status tend to conceal it to 
promote harmony.97 Lower-status members tend to participate less actively 
in group discussions; when they possess expertise and insights that could aid 
the group, failure to fully utilize these members reduces the group’s overall 
performance. Supervisors can help here by encouraging these employees to 
speak up.98 But that does not mean a group of only high-status individuals 
would be preferable. Adding some high-status individuals to a group of mid￾status individuals may be advantageous because group performance suffers 
when too many high-status people are in the mix.99
Status Inequity It is important for group members to believe the status hierarchy 
is equitable. Perceived inequity creates disequilibrium, which inspires various types 
of corrective behaviors. Hierarchy can lead to negative emotions and resentment 
among those at the lower end of the status continuum.100 Large differences in sta￾tus within groups are also associated with poorer individual performance, lower 
health, and more pronounced intentions for the lower-status members to leave the 
group.101 This is also true for gig workers and contractors; when they perceive dis￾parity in status between themselves and their clients, they are less likely to be com￾mitted to them or their own contracting employer and may be more likely to leave 
the employment relationship.102 Generally, inequity in power-based forms of status 
tends to have more negative effects: It tends to drive interpersonal conflict, whereas 
other forms promote healthy competition for status advancement.103
Groups generally agree within themselves on status criteria; hence, there 
is usually high concurrence on group rankings of individuals. Business execu￾tives may use personal income or the growth rate of their companies as deter￾minants of status. Government bureaucrats may use the size of their budgets, 
and blue-collar workers may use their years of seniority. Managers who occupy 
central positions in their social networks are typically seen as higher in status by 
their subordinates, and this position actually translates into greater influence 
over the group’s functioning.104 Regardless of one’s status, however, accurate 
knowledge of the status hierarchy (i.e., “who is who in my group”) leads to 
better performance and results in effective within-group networking.105

Aaron Rodgers has high status as the 
quarterback of the Green Bay Packers 
football team. His status derives from 
his ability to contribute to his team’s 
success in winning games. Rodgers’s 
teammates and coaches value his 
character, leadership skills, expertise 
in calling plays, and ability to throw 
touchdown passes accurately while 
on the move.
M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 315 13/12/22 2:51 AM316 PART 3 The Group
 Groups generally form an informal status order based on ranking and com￾mand of needed resources. 106 Individuals can find themselves in conflicts when 
they move between groups whose status criteria are different or when they join 
groups whose members have heterogeneous backgrounds. Group cultures also 
differ in their criteria for conferring status upon individuals. When groups are 
heterogeneous, status differences may initiate conflict as the group attempts to 
reconcile the separate hierarchies. 107 As we will see in the next chapter, this can 
be a problem when management creates teams of employees from varied func￾tions. Lastly, the threat of lost status can lead high-status group members to take 
desperate action. For instance, one study of senior politicians showed that those 
who were under threat of lost status were more likely to engage in large-scale 
corporate bribery. 108 Furthermore, the loss of high-status group members 
to higher-status competitors can also be detrimental to the group (although 
the group may actually benefit if the high-status group member leaves for a 
 lower-status group). 109
 Group Property 4: Size and Dynamics 
 Does the size of a group affect the group’s overall behavior? Yes, but the effect 
depends on the outcome of interest (e.g., performance, creativity). 111 Groups 
with a dozen or more members are good for gaining diverse input. 112 If the 
goal is fact-finding or idea-generating, then larger groups should be more 
 effective. 113 Smaller groups of about seven members are better if the goal is 
 performance and productivity 114 and for “transformational” leadership tech￾niques to be most effect (see the chapter on leadership) . 
115 Group size also 
has implications for ethical decision making. For instance, we hold group size 
stereotypes associated with trustworthiness (e.g., smaller groups are more

an organization, as self-promotion 
can be a valuable asset in terms of 
standing out among your competitors. 
Furthermore, narcissistic people can 
also be very charismatic and driven, 
enabling them to excel in adaptive or 
chaotic environments. On the other 
hand, narcissists can create challenges 
for groups. For example, narcissists 
have been found to scoff when assigned 
to low-status roles. They often become 
less satisfied and react more defen￾sively than less-narcissistic individuals 
assigned to similar roles. Furthermore, 
narcissists prioritize their own interests 
ahead of those of the group. They are 
not as inclined to engage in extra-role 
behaviors to assist the group.
While narcissists can contribute 
to greater group cohesion, this usu￾ally occurs in only a handful of cir￾cumstances. For instance, cohesion 
levels may be higher if narcissists are 
admired by the group. In this case, the 
narcissist is also more likely to iden￾tify with and like their group. On the 
other hand, if there is a rivalry between 
a narcissist and others in the group, 
narcissists may try to remove these 
rivals from the group or leave the 
group themselves. Another obstacle to 
group cohesion is the fact that narcis￾sists often either are disliked by their 
peers or end up becoming unpopular. 
(After a while, people start to see 
through the bragging and shameless 
self-promotion.)
Despite these challenges, some 
strategies can prevent the potential 
adverse effects of narcissists on group 
functioning. Creating a strong sense of 
group cohesion can help make unac￾ceptable behavior more noticeable. 
Peer pressure can help the narcissist 
adapt to the group’s norms. One norm 
that can be developed is providing con￾structive peer feedback. A  narcissist 
will likely respond better to this type 
of feedback since it would not be per￾ceived as threatening if it came from a 
single person or leader. Although man￾aging a narcissist can be challenging 
as they often fail to acknowledge any 
issues with their behavior, it is essen￾tial to ensure a group’s cohesion and 
success. 110

trustworthy).116 Also, we tend to feel less compassion and empathy toward 
(and are thus less likely to help) groups that are large in size.117
Group dynamics are also important for characterizing groups. One of the 
most important findings about the size of a group concerns social loafing, the 
tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than 
when alone.118 Social loafing directly challenges the assumption that the pro￾ductivity of the group as a whole should at least equal the sum of the productiv￾ity of the individuals in it, no matter the group size.
What causes social loafing? It may be a belief that others in the group are not 
carrying their fair share. Particularly, the group must believe the social loafer is 
acting in an exploitive manner (benefiting at the expense of other team mem￾bers).119 Another explanation for social loafing is diffusion of responsibility. 
Because group results cannot be attributed to any single person, the relationship 
between an individual’s input and the group’s output is clouded. Individuals 
may then be tempted to become free riders and coast on the group’s efforts.120
The implications for OB are significant. When managers use collective work 
situations, they must also be able to identify individual efforts. Greater perfor￾mance diversity creates greater social loafing the longer a group is together, 
which decreases satisfaction and performance.121
The stronger an individual’s work ethic, the less likely that person is to engage 
in social loafing.122 Also, the greater the level of conscientiousness and agreeable￾ness (see the chapter on personality and individual differences) in a group, the 
more likely that performance will remain high whether there is social loafing or 
not.123 Virtual groups also may have issues with social loafing, especially if mem￾bers are dissimilar and have a number of family responsibilities that detract their 
attention from group performance.124 There are ways to prevent social loafing:
1. Set group goals so the group has a common purpose to strive toward.
2. Increase intergroup competition that focuses on the shared group outcome.
3. Engage in peer evaluations.
4. Select members who have high motivation and prefer to work in groups.
5. Base group rewards in part on each member’s unique contributions and 
structure work so that each member’s contribution can be identified.125

Group Property 5: Cohesion
For a group to be highly functioning, it must act cohesively as a unit. Groups 
differ in their cohesion—the degree to which members hold a shared bond 
with one another and are motivated to stay in the group.126 Some work 
groups are cohesive because the members have spent a great deal of time 
together, the group’s small size or purpose facilitates high interaction, or 
external threats have brought members close together. Research suggests 
that the connections made in cohesive teams may even remain active after 
teams disband.127
Cohesion affects group productivity, and vice versa.128 It can also lead 
individual group members to engage in OCBs and feel more confident in 
their jobs, and eventually, it can lead to growth in productivity over time.129
However, the influence of cohesion may depend on other group characteris￾tics. For instance, cohesion is more important in groups in which members’ 
roles and responsibilities are highly dependent on one another (e.g., proj￾ect teams).130 Furthermore, studies consistently show that the relationship 
between cohesion and productivity depends on the group’s performance￾related norms.131 If norms for quality, output, and cooperation with outsid￾ers are high, a cohesive group will be productive. But if cohesion is high and 
performance norms are low, productivity will be low. Conversely, when cohe￾sion is low and performance norms are high, productivity will be moderate 
(but not as high as it would be if the group were cohesive). Regardless, when 
cohesion and performance-related norms are both low, productivity tends 
to fall into the low-to-moderate range. These conclusions are summarized in 
Exhibit 9-4.

 Toward a Better World 
 Whirlpool: Building Cohesion Through 
Volunteering 
 Habitat for Humanity is a well-known 
nonprofit with the mission of provid￾ing affordable housing to people and 
families in need. Through donations, 
volunteering efforts, and partnerships, 
Habitat for Humanity can provide hous￾ing and affordable mortgages to fami￾lies in need and has been doing so 
for decades. Whirlpool, a Fortune 500 
manufacturer of home appliances, has 
a long-standing partnership with Habitat 
for Humanity. For more than twenty 
years, Whirlpool has helped build new 
homes in over forty-five countries. It 
has helped more than one hundred 
thousand families in the United States 
and Canada alone. Whirlpool has 
made a substantial commitment of its 
production and financial resources— 
committing over $100  million and 
donating nearly two hundred thousand 
appliances to homes worldwide. 
 Despite these substantial contribu￾tions, Whirlpool also derives a unique 
benefit from its employee volunteers 
contributing to these efforts. For more 
than twenty years, more than eight 
thousand employees across numer￾ous departments and work groups 
have volunteered, donating on aver￾age anywhere between 250 and 500 
hours per home. Whirlpool enables 
employees to participate in Habitat for 
Humanity both on a rolling basis (e.g., 
weekend projects) and as a part of 
large-scale, organized events, such as 
the Whirlpool Community Day and the 
Blitz Build (a collaboration with Indiana 
University Kelley School of Business). 
 As John O’Connor of the career 
services firm Career Pro Inc. notes, 
“Sometimes the best building of bonds 
and trust is outside the walls of the 
organization . . . Volunteer experiences 
where trust can be built often directly 
translate positively and immediately.” 
Indeed, many executives, managers, 
and employees across organizations 
describe how volunteering helps bring 
them closer to others in their organi￾zations and work groups. Conversely, 
many suggest that volunteering is 
often stigmatized when it is associated 
with being distracted from work and 
pulling one’s attention away from their 
obligations. Regardless, does it help 
build cohesion and commitment like so 
many suggest? 
 The picture is much more nuanced 
than expected. One study of volunteer￾ing in Street Soccer USA suggests 
that volunteering does not necessar￾ily develop cohesion among members 
of a work group. However, it can help 
develop greater cohesion among the 
people who participate in the effort. 
In other words, the volunteering group 
develops a sense of cohesion as its 
own group and in that context. The 
activity can also help reduce prejudice 
among the group members, especially 
if it is demographically diverse in com￾position. Furthermore, not all volun￾teers become involved for the same 
reasons, nor do they approach the 
activity with the same drives. Although 
people often assume that volunteers 
are all service-oriented and striving to 
fulfill the same needs, research sug￾gests that volunteers differ in their 
commitment to volunteering. Some 
see themselves as administrators and 
managers of the effort, neglecting to 
get their “hands dirty” with the activ￾ity. In contrast, others are dedicated 
to the activity and become deeply 
involved in the effort and committed 
to their work groups and organizations. 
Still, others are less reliable episodic 
volunteers who are not as invested in 
the activity. Differences in these moti￾vations do not necessarily beget cohe￾sion in work groups that volunteer and 
potentially cause conflict. Regardless, 
a more straightforward answer to the 
question suggests that volunteering 
can be a powerful tool to increase 
cohesion—if the conditions, support, 
and motivations are right. 134 
 Group Decision Making 
 The belief—characterized by juries—that two heads are better than one has 
long been accepted as a basic component of the U.S. legal system and those 
of many other countries. Many decisions in organizations are made by groups, 
teams, or committees (or multiple groups, teams, or committees). 135 We will 
discuss the advantages of group decision making, along with the unique chal￾lenges that group dynamics bring to the decision-making process. Finally, 
we will offer some techniques for maximizing the group decision-making 
opportunity. 
9- 7 Contrast the strengths 
and weaknesses of group 
decision making. 
M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 319 13/12/22 2:51 AM320 PART 3 The Group
Groups Versus the Individual
Decision-making groups may be widely used in organizations, but are group 
decisions preferable to those made by an individual alone? The answer depends 
on several factors. Let us begin by looking at the strengths, weaknesses, and effi￾cacy of group decision making.
Strengths of Group Decision Making Groups generate more complete information and 
knowledge. By aggregating the resources of several individuals, groups bring more 
input as well as heterogeneity into the decision process (as long as this information is 
reliable).136 They offer increased diversity of views. This opens the opportunity to con￾sider more approaches and alternatives.137 Finally, groups lead to increased accep￾tance of a solution. During decision making, members are more likely to be accept￾ing when dissenting opinions are framed as debates rather than disagreements.138
Group members who participate in decisions are more likely to enthusiastically sup￾port and encourage others to accept them once the decision has been made.
Weaknesses of Group Decision Making Group decisions are time-consuming 
because groups typically take more time to reach a solution, especially for vir￾tual groups.139 There are conformity pressures. The desire by group members to 
be accepted and considered an asset to the group can squash any overt disagree￾ment and cause group members to settle for less.140 Group discussion can be 
dominated by one or a few members. If they are low- and medium-ability members 
or if the information they provide is unreliable, the group’s overall effectiveness 
will suffer.141 Interestingly, in virtual contexts, this may be addressed by allowing 
minority members to have secret conversations and lead to improved decision 
quality.142 Also, setting a norm that allows “lone dissenters,” or group members 
who have divergent opinions, can reduce conformity and the influence of domi￾nating members.143 Finally, group decisions suffer from ambiguous responsibility.
In an individual decision, it is clear who is accountable for the outcome. In a 
group decision, the responsibility of any single member is diluted.
Effectiveness and Efficiency Whether groups are more effective than individuals 
depends on how you define effectiveness and who is making the evaluation. As 
discussed in the chapter on perception and individual decision-making, the accu￾racy of evaluators can be affected by general perceptions of group cohesion and 
trust.144 Group decisions are generally more accurate than the decisions of the 
average individual in a group, but they are less accurate than the judgments of 
the most accurate person.145 In terms of speed, individuals are superior. If creativ￾ity is important, groups tend to be more effective. And if effectiveness means the 
degree of acceptance of achievable solutions, the nod again goes to the group.146
We cannot consider effectiveness without also assessing efficiency. With few 
exceptions, group decision making consumes more work hours than having an 
individual tackle the same problem. The exceptions tend to be instances in which, 
to achieve comparable quantities of diverse input, the single decision maker must 
spend a great deal of time reviewing files and talking to other people who have 
unique information that could lead to a better solution.147 Research suggests that 
groups may be inefficient in decision making if information is heavily dispersed 
among group members and effectively “hidden.” It is very difficult to compile this 
information to make the best decision, and groups in these situations are encour￾aged to openly and collaboratively share information to solve the problem.148 In 
deciding whether to use groups, then, managers must assess whether increases in 
effectiveness are more than enough to offset the reductions in efficiency.
In summary, groups are an excellent vehicle for performing many steps in 
the decision-making process and offer both breadth and depth of input for 
M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 320 13/12/22 2:51 AMFoundations of Group Behavior CHAPTER 9 321
information gathering. These pluses, however, may be more than offset by the 
time consumed by group decisions, the internal conflicts they may create, and 
the pressures they generate toward conformity. In some cases, therefore, we can 
expect individuals to make better decisions than groups. It is also important to 
note that groups can also benefit from decision-making support, assistance, and 
guidelines. For instance, providing in-process support and assistance can help 
offset some of the limitations of group decision making and may lead groups 
to discuss member preferences less, pool more critical information, and spend 
more time in discussion (than if they did not receive any support).149
Groupthink and Groupshift
Two by-products of group decision making, groupthink and groupshift, 
can affect a group’s ability to appraise alternatives objectively and achieve 
high-quality solutions.
Groupthink Groupthink describes situations in which group pressures for 
conformity deter the group from critically appraising unusual, minority, or 
unpopular views. Groupthink negatively impacts many groups and can dra￾matically hinder their performance.150 Groupthink appears closely aligned with 
the conclusions Solomon Asch drew in his experiments with a lone dissenter. 
Individuals who hold a position different from that of the dominant majority 
are under pressure to suppress, withhold, or modify their true feelings and 
beliefs. Similarly, the Abilene Paradox results when a group makes a collective 
decision that is counter to what the individual members actually desire or think 
is the best course of action. As an example, people often sign petitions as a part 
of a group because they fear how others in their group will evaluate them for 
not signing them (despite disagreeing with what is in the petitions).151
Groups that are more focused on performance than learning are especially 
likely to fall victim to groupthink and to suppress the opinions of those who do 
not agree with the majority.152 Groupthink seems to occur most often early in 
the group’s tenure, when there is a clear group identity, when members hold 
a positive image of their group they want to protect, and when the group per￾ceives a collective threat to its positive image.153
What can managers do to minimize groupthink?154 First, they can monitor 
group size. People grow more intimidated and hesitant as group size increases. 
Managers should also encourage group leaders to play an impartial role. Leaders 
should actively seek input from all members, especially in the early stages of delib￾eration. In addition, managers should appoint one group member to play the 
role of devil’s advocate, overtly challenging the majority position and offering 
divergent perspectives. Yet another suggestion is to use exercises that stimulate 
active discussion of diverse alternatives without threatening the group or intensi￾fying identity protection. Have group members delay discussion of possible gains 
so they can first talk about the dangers or risks inherent in a decision. Requiring 
members to focus initially on the negatives of an alternative makes the group less 
likely to stifle dissenting views and more likely to gain an objective evaluation.
Groupshift Groupshift, or group polarization, describes the way group mem￾bers tend to exaggerate their initial positions when discussing a given set of alter￾natives to arrive at a solution. We can view this group polarization as a special 
case of groupthink. The group’s decision reflects the dominant decision-making 
norm—toward greater caution or more risk—that develops during discus￾sion.155 In groups, discussion leads members toward a more extreme view of the 
position they already held.156
groupthink A phenomenon in which the 
norm for consensus overrides the realistic 
appraisal of alternative courses of action.
groupshift A change between a group’s 
decision and an individual decision that a 
member within the group would make; the 
shift can be toward either conservatism 
or greater risk, but it generally is toward a 
more extreme version of the group’s original 
position.
M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 321 13/12/22 2:51 AM322 PART 3 The Group
The shift toward polarization has several explanations.157 It has been argued, 
for instance, that discussion is persuasive and makes the members more com￾fortable with each other and thus more willing to express extreme versions of 
their original positions. Another argument is that the group diffuses respon￾sibility. Group decisions free any single member from accountability for the 
group’s final choice, so a more extreme position can be taken. It is also likely 
that people take extreme positions because they want to demonstrate how dif￾ferent they are from the outgroup.158
So how should you use the findings on groupshift? Recognize that group 
decisions exaggerate the initial position of individual members, the shift has 
been shown more often to be toward greater risk, and which way a group will 
shift is a function of the members’ prediscussion inclinations. We now turn to 
the techniques by which groups make decisions. These reduce some of the dys￾functional aspects of group decision making.
Group Decision-Making Techniques
The most common form of group decision making takes place in interacting 
groups.
159 Members rely on both verbal and nonverbal interaction to commu￾nicate. But as our discussion of groupthink demonstrated, interacting groups 
often censor themselves and pressure individual members toward conformity 
of opinion. Brainstorming and the nominal group technique can reduce prob￾lems inherent in the traditional interacting group.
Brainstorming Brainstorming can overcome the pressures for conformity 
that dampen creativity160 by encouraging any and all alternatives while with￾holding criticism. In a typical brainstorming session, the group leader states 
the problem in a clear manner so all group members understand. Members 
then freewheel as many alternatives as they can in a given length of time. To 
encourage members to “think the unusual,” no criticism is allowed, even of 
the most bizarre suggestions, and all ideas are recorded for later discussion 
and analysis.
Brainstorming may indeed generate ideas—but not very efficiently. Research 
consistently shows individuals working alone generate more ideas than a group 
in a brainstorming session. One reason for this is “production blocking.” When 
people are generating ideas in a group, many are talking at once, which blocks 
individuals’ thought process and eventually impedes the sharing of ideas.161
Nominal Group Technique The nominal group technique may be more effective. 
This technique restricts discussion and interpersonal communication during 
the decision-making process. Group members are all physically present, as in a 
traditional meeting, but they operate independently. Specifically, a problem is 
presented, and then the group takes the following steps:
1. Before any discussion takes place, each member independently records 
ideas about the problem.
2. Afterward, each member presents one idea to the group. No discussion 
takes place until all ideas have been presented and recorded.
3. The group discusses the ideas for clarity and evaluates them.
4. Each group member silently and independently rank-orders the ideas. The 
idea with the highest aggregate ranking determines the final decision.
The chief advantage of the nominal group technique is that it permits a 
group to meet formally but does not restrict independent thinking. Research 
generally shows that nominal groups outperform brainstorming groups.162
interacting groups Typical groups in which 
members interact with each other, relying on 
both verbal and nonverbal communication.
brainstorming An idea-generation process 
that specifically encourages any and all 
alternatives while withholding any criticism of 
those alternatives.
nominal group technique A group decision￾making method in which members meet to 
pool their judgments in a systematic but 
independent fashion.
M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 322 13/12/22 2:51 AMFoundations of Group Behavior CHAPTER 9 323
Each of the group decision techniques has its own set of strengths and weak￾nesses. The choice depends on the criteria you want to emphasize and the 
cost–benefit trade-off. As Exhibit 9-5 indicates, an interacting group is good for 
achieving commitment to a solution, brainstorming develops group cohesive￾ness, and the nominal group technique is an efficient means for generating 
many ideas.
Summary
This chapter laid the groundwork for discussions of groups and teams in 
organizations, both formal and informal. In defining the nature of groups in or￾ganizations, we first discussed social identity as a foundational theory describing 
how people identify with and behave as members of a group. Next, we described 
how groups form and dissolve over time. For the remainder of the chapter, we 
described several groups’ properties that impact how groups and teams operate 
in organizational contexts. First, differences in role perceptions and expecta￾tions can often result in conflict, such as how employees’ psychological con￾tracts may be violated, resulting in adverse outcomes. Second, group norms can 
significantly influence group functioning, altering group emotions, behaviors, 
and outcomes. Third, group member status can affect the power and influence 
between people and the capability of directing the course of action for the 
group. Fourth, the group’s size matters, depending upon the group outcome 
of interest—groups can either be too large or too small, increasing the poten￾tial for social loafing in some cases. Fifth, and finally, cohesion is an essential 
characteristic of groups that has significant implications for a group’s ability to 
coordinate, work effectively together, and stay together. At the end of the chap￾ter, we described how some decisions are made within groups, pitfalls and traps 
groups fall into (e.g., groupthink and groupshift), and strategies for improving 
the quality of group decisions.
Implications for Managers
● How can you expect group members to contribute toward or act as a 
part of the group if they do not identify with the group? Managers would 
do well to promote group members’ identification and manage identity 
threats while at the same time avoiding biased ingroup favoritism.

● When forming new work groups, try to consider and anticipate the “group 
life cycle” and the phases groups move through. Groups rarely are im￾mediately effective without careful placement, training, and onboarding. 
Recognizing the current stage of any given group can help managers pro￾vide the support and assistance they need to aid the group and address 
any problems that arise.
● Role clarity through aligned role expectations and perceptions is essential 
for group members to understand what is expected of them.
● Managers should establish clear psychological contracts within groups, 
fulfill their part of the contract, and rebuild trust when it is broken.
● When experiencing role conflict, try to be creative in how you approach 
it. Often when you are able to adapt there are creative solutions that en￾able both roles to be fulfilled. Also, for employees experiencing role con￾flict, management support and resources can help balance competing 
demands.
● Norms can have a powerful influence on behavior in organizations, and 
sometimes we are not even aware of them (or that they are directing be￾havior). Try to keep a pulse on norms in your work group (and the ex￾ample you are setting).
● Managers should be mindful of status differences in their work groups. 
They should establish checks and balances so leaders do not justify un￾ethical behavior or unethically try to maintain their status. They should 
actively encourage lower-status members to contribute and provide a psy￾chologically safe environment for them to voice their ideas, thoughts, and 
concerns.
● Design work groups of the appropriate size for the group’s function to 
avoid social loafing.
● Consider building your work group’s cohesion to reduce turnover and 
increase the group’s effectiveness.
● Some decisions are better left to individuals. But if the group must make 
the decision collaboratively, the group should strive to avoid groupthink 
and groupshift, encourage open communication among members, and 
take on a structured approach to fulfill its purpose (e.g., nominal group 
technique).

 Conformity Is Counterproductive and Should Be Avoided 
POINT 
W hile individuals may have good intentions when trying to 
conform or fit in, this inauthenticity can negatively impact 
psychological and emotional well-being. Although confor￾mity can be unintentional, with many unknowingly falling in line with 
the rest of the group, it can also be an intentional process that should 
be avoided. Conformity strips people of their autonomy and authentic￾ity. When employees can be their authentic selves, there are multiple 
benefits, including lower stress levels and increased overall well-being. 
 In more extreme cases, conformity can even lead to serious un￾ethical behavior and group division. For instance, social media has 
created conformity dynamics that make it extremely easy for people 
to band together under common interests. These groups divide the 
world into ingroups and outgroups and criticize others who think dif￾ferently as evil or reprehensible. Conformity may be highly responsible 
for this polarization. People look to trusted members of ingroups for 
how to feel or act, signal to other members they “belong” to the group, 
echo important group members’ beliefs or positions, and perpetuate 
the spread of problematic information through the network in a social 
cascade. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these cas￾cades led to the retweeting and reposting of inaccurate information 
by thousands of people (e.g., viral inaccurate memes about the virus). 
 As Adam Grant describes in his book Originals: How Non￾Conformists Move the World , individuals who think for themselves 
and do not go along with ideas just because they are popular can be 
some of the best innovators. Organizations need more “shapers,” or 
what Grant calls the independent and curious thinkers. Because they 
are not consumed by a fear of failing and do not hesitate to break 
norms, they can also influence others to be more original. Although 
deviating from the group is often no easy task, ultimately, it can lead 
individuals to be more innovative, productive, and satisfied at work. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 T
 here is a time and place for conformity, particularly when it 
can help support an organization’s larger goals. Research has 
shown that peer pressure can be very effective at motivating 
individuals to conform to certain norms. In one study on improving 
hand hygiene in hospitals, an intervention that utilized peer pressure 
was more effective than a monetary incentive in improving hand hy￾giene. In this case, doctors were pressured to conform to the desired 
norm of hand hygiene through strategies like appreciation notes, cel￾ebratory emails, and firm reminders of the importance of cooperating 
to achieve a collective goal. In this case, conformity was key to the 
health and safety of patients. 
 Furthermore, conformists may be crucial to innovation in organiza￾tions. Although teams with creative individuals can develop excellent 
ideas, many innovative ideas may never be executed. If members of 
the group dislike rules and are prone to conflict, they may reject the 
ideas and refuse to implement them. However, when there is a balance 
within the team, including both nonconformists and conformists, there 
is greater group cohesion, facilitating creative ideas that will benefit 
the organization. Thus, although conformists may not be as helpful in 
generating innovative ideas, they can dramatically increase a group’s 
ability to innovate. As such, conformity is hardly counterproductive. 163

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
Groups have a powerful influence on individuals, and 
group characteristics impact their decision making, in￾novation, performance, and even unethical behavior. 
Norms may be beneficial when they guide group mem￾bers toward appropriate behavior and prompt them to 
engage in prosocial behaviors. Yet groups may also exert 
influences that may be harmful, encourage conformity, 
and lead to poor decision making. By gaining an under￾standing of group behaviors, you can better understand 
how to leverage group processes in the workplace in your 
interactions with your coworkers, supervisors, and subor￾dinates. Armed with this knowledge, you can recognize 
and avoid counterproductive processes that stem from 
conflicting role expectations, counterproductive norms, 
status and size dynamics, factors that prevent group cohe￾sion, and common traps in group decision making. In 
this chapter, you learned valuable lessons about critical 
thinking, creativity, and collaboration when listening to 
gossip about other group members, managing narcissis￾tic group members, critically evaluating the function of 
conformity in work groups, and reflecting on whether 
volunteering improves group cohesion. In the next sec￾tion, you will continue to develop these skills as well as 
your communication and self-management skills to sur￾viving the wild alone and in a group, considering how 
you should respond to a supervisor’s unethical behavior, 
and exploring how a group divided affected a military 
campaign.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Surviving the Wild: Join a Group or Go It Alone?
You are a member of a hiking party. After reaching base 
camp on the first day, you decide to take a quick sunset 
hike by yourself. After a few exhilarating miles, you turn 
around for the return to camp. On your way back, you 
realize you are lost. You shout for help to no avail. It is 
now dark—and getting cold.

ETHICAL DILEMMA Follow the Leader?
You are at dinner with your work group. You have been 
looking forward to spending time with your coworkers 
outside the office all week. However, when you arrive, 
your supervisor (Devon) is not pleased with the table and 
demands that they switch your group to a different one. 
When the server tells your supervisor it is impossible, the 
supervisor requests to speak with the restaurant manager, 
who asserts that there are simply no other tables available.
While the rest of the group tries to move on, the su￾pervisor continues to make comments, complaining, “Is 
anyone else upset about this view? Why is there all of this 
loud construction happening?” Once again, the server 
tries to explain, but the supervisor interrupts, “You re￾ally need to work on your customer service.” Then when 
the server walks away, someone from your team makes 
a joke about the server’s competence. The supervisor 
seems to approve and makes another derogatory remark 
about the server. To your disgust, everyone in the group 
laughs but you.
While your supervisor is engaged in a conversation 
with someone else, you whisper to a coworker seated next 
to you that you think you should say something. “Are you 
kidding me?” your coworker says in a low voice. “I mean, 
this isn’t the first time something like this has happened 
with Devon, so what did you expect?” Your coworker sighs 
and adds, “Well, do it at your own risk.”164
Discussion Questions
9-25. If you were a member of this group, would you 
communicate to the supervisor that you do not 
approve of their language and behavior? Or 
would you stay silent? Explain.
9-26. What role do you believe norms play in this situa￾tion? What norms could be operating in this situ￾ation and from what source (e.g., the group, the 
restaurant, customer interactions)?
9-27. Why do you think no one else in the group 
stepped up and confronted the supervisor about 
their behavior? What forces could have been at 
play?
9-28. In your opinion, what would have been the worst 
way to respond to this situation? What would have 
been the best way to respond to the situation? 
Explain.
CASE INCIDENT Cultural Context and Group Dynamics
The use of collaborative group working and teamwork has 
been a consistent trend in most global companies. The 
processes, norms, and dynamics of group work have been 
intensively studied by many Western social psychologists 
and management scholars. However, as we increasingly 
live and work in a global world, the big question is, do the 
same principles of group dynamics apply across cultures? 
The answer to the question has implications on how we 
work in cross-cultural teams and how we manage group 
work across different countries.
We know from research that national contexts play 
a major role in shaping an individual’s social attitudes, 
values, behaviors, and sensemaking process, all of which 
matter when it comes to working in a group and can, in 
turn, shape group processes. Research can also give us 
some insight into how group norms and roles as well as 
the processes of group influence may vary across cultures. 
For example, studies of groups and teams in East-Asian 
countries like China and South Korea suggest that specific 
cultural characteristics, such as the prevalence of collec￾tivist values, can provide important foundations for work￾ing in groups by reducing negative dynamics like social 
loafing. On the other hand, some aspects of many East￾Asian cultures, such as strong social hierarchies and high 
power distance (the tendency to exhibit great deference 
to someone with authority), may impede decision-making 
processes, as group members may feel less empowered 
to voice opinions different to those of the group leader. 
Thinking about how work groups operate across cultures 
allows us to think critically about the premises of a theory, 
to refine it, and to understand its limits.
For the practice of managing in the global context, it 
is vital for leaders to be sensitive and aware that different 
group processes may work slightly differently in different 
national contexts. Yet they also need to keep in mind that 
people are not completely programmed by their culture 
and may indeed be very adaptable to new kinds of tasks and 
working formats. Cultural influence on group dynamics 
M09_ROBB0025_19_GE_C09.indd 328 13/12/22 2:51 AMFoundations of Group Behavior CHAPTER 9 329
poses interesting questions for leaders, such as whether 
practices should be adapted to the specific ways in which 
groups may operate in certain cultural contexts, or alterna￾tively, whether a particular way of teamworking that leaders 
are used to should be imposed on teams regardless of cul￾tural context. 
The answer may be more complex than a simple binary. 
While cultural differences in a team may be disruptive, they 
can also be synergistic and offer advantages. Recent stud￾ies suggest that thinking about differences in culture as a 
resource rather than a problem may help managers analyze 
and leverage them to increase productivity. Leaders need 
to have good knowledge of the central aspects of the local 
culture that would help them make informed decisions on 
whether to minimize or to adopt some or all cultural dif￾ferences, leveraging them to achieve better team dynamics 
or performance as well as make decisions on how these 
outcomes may be accomplished. This would mean creat￾ing a somewhat hybrid culture, a mix or blend of different 
cultural aspects present in the workplace, one that is not 
necessarily predetermined but emerges from interactions, 
resulting in the development of new guidelines and objec￾tives in relation to work, roles, and communication among 
the culturally diverse team.
To achieve this, we need to identify and encourage the 
kinds of cultural differences that allow teams to be more 
productive and creative. At the same time, it is important 
to recognize differences that can be disruptive. While 
these differences can still be respected, group leaders 
can set ground rules and clarify processes and proce￾dures within groups to help prevent conflict and friction. 
Such a “hybrid culture” approach acknowledges that cul￾tural context certainly does impact group dynamics but 
takes a balanced attitude to managing differences, rather 
than simply adopting or discarding all of them.165
Questions
9-29. Think about your own experience of working in 
a group. How do you think your cultural back￾ground impacts your experience of working in a 
group?
9-30. Is working in and managing a monocultural 
group problem-free?
9-31. Imagine you are a manager tasked with supervising 
work groups in a context different to your home 
country. You are very new to the context and do 
not know much about it. What can help you to 
understand how to build group cohesion?

 RESILIENT TEAMS 
I
n 2018, twelve boys and their soccer coach were trapped deep within a 
maze of caves in Thailand. The team had planned to explore the caves 
for no more than an hour, but flash floods took them by surprise and forced 
them to travel even deeper into the caves. They would not emerge for another 
two weeks. It was a dire situation as the summer rainy season would soon 
begin. After the boys’ bikes, bags, and football shoes were found outside 
the Tham Luang cave, a rescue team was quickly put together. The rescue 
team had to decide whether they should try a risky rescue attempt or leave 
the boys where they were for a few months, delivering food when possible. 
 The rescue team relied on their collective expertise to develop as many 
solutions as possible. It was important in this situation that team members 
felt their ideas would be taken seriously no matter how unconventional. 
In a unique situation like this, input was needed from all team members. 
They considered options like drilling down through the caves to establish 
proof of life, using an industrial pump system to lower the water levels 
in the caves, and finally diving down to rescue the boys and their coach. 
Ultimately the rescue team realized they would have to choose a solution 
quickly—they soon decided to assemble a dive team to reach the trapped 
teens. The boys had to be heavily sedated as there was no way the boys 
who had never dived before could make it through the flooded tunnels. 
 The multinational team that was able to execute the soccer team’s 
incredible rescue overcame extreme conditions and the loss of a former Thai

Navy SEAL in the process. Studies indicate that team members frequently 
only discuss ideas that are commonly known rather than unique ideas out 
of concern that they will be rejected for suggesting different information. 
However, this team’s ability to not fall into this common trap is what made 
them successful. Their creative and novel plan would not have been possible 
without a team culture that encouraged and even required creative idea 
generation along with the psychological safety to ensure members felt like 
they could speak up when they had an idea. The team was open to myriad 
ideas and was able to effectively collaborate to refine and execute the plan.
The soccer team was also an effective team in its own way. Determined 
to survive, they used rocks to dig and create a cavern where they could 
huddle together to stay warm. The coach, a former monk, taught them 
meditation techniques to stay calm, use as little air as possible, and limit 
their movement to conserve their strength. In the end, all twelve boys and 
their coach were successfully rescued.1         
SoaPen, which received a $50,000 grant from Toyota and numerous awards 
from organizations like UNICEF, is the product of teamwork and the 
entrepreneurial spirit.2 The founders (Amanat Anand, Shubham Issar, and 
Maria Putri), a diverse women entrepreneurial team, designed the product 
(soap in the form of a thick colored pen that children can draw with) to make 
hand hygiene more accessible to children. Building their team was incredibly 
important, and Shubham notes that discovering people with complimentary 
expertise and different perspectives was critical to their success as a startup.3
Teams can sometimes achieve feats an individual could never accomplish.4
Teams are more flexible and responsive to changing events than traditional 
departments or other forms of permanent groupings. They can quickly assem￾ble, deploy, refocus, and disband. And, finally, research indicates that our 
involvement in teams positively shapes the way we think as individuals, introduc￾ing a collaborative mindset about even our personal decision making.5
The fact that organizations have embraced teamwork does not necessarily mean 
teams are always effective. Team members, as humans, can be swayed by errors in 
decision-making processes and dynamics (see, for example, the previous chapter 
on the foundations of group behavior) that can lead them astray from the best deci￾sions. What conditions affect their potential? How do members work together? To 
answer these questions, let us first distinguish between groups and teams.
Differences Between Groups and Teams
According to some scholars, groups and teams are not the same thing (although 
functionally, the terms are often used to refer to the same thing).6 In the previous 
chapter (foundations of group behavior), we defined a group as two or more indi￾viduals, interacting and interdependent, who come together to achieve particular 
objectives. A work group interacts primarily to share information and make deci￾sions to help each member perform within their respective area of responsibility.
Work groups have no need or opportunity to engage in collective work with joint 
effort, so the group’s performance is merely the summation of each member’s indi￾vidual contribution. There is no positive synergy that would create an overall level 
work group A group that interacts primarily 
to share information and make decisions to 
help each group member perform within their 
respective area of responsibility.

of performance greater than the sum of the inputs. A work group is a collection of 
individuals doing their work, albeit with some interaction and/or dependency.
A work team, on the other hand, generates positive synergy through coordi￾nation.7 The individual efforts result in a level of performance greater than the 
sum of the individual inputs. Teams are more likely to be constantly changing and 
adapting rather than static entities—seeing teams as dynamic systems in this way 
has led many to focus more on teaming as a verb (e.g., on the processes or actions 
involved in engaging as a team) rather than on the team itself.8
In both work groups and work teams, there are often behavioral expectations 
of members, collective normalization efforts, active group dynamics, and some 
level of decision making (even if only informally). Both may generate ideas, pool 
resources, or coordinate logistics such as work schedules; for the work group, how￾ever, this effort is limited to information gathering for decision makers outside the 
group. Whereas we can think of a work team as a subset of a work group, the team 
is constructed to be purposeful (symbiotic) in its member interaction. Exhibit 10-1 
highlights the differences between them.
The definitions help clarify why organizations structure work processes in 
the way they do. The extensive use of teams creates the potential for an organi￾zation to generate greater outputs with no increase in employee head count. 
Notice, however, that we said potential. There is nothing magical that ensures 
the achievement of positive synergy in the creation of teams. Merely calling a 
group a team does not automatically improve its performance. As we show later, 
effective teams have certain common characteristics. If management hopes 
to gain increases in organizational performance through teams, these teams 
should possess these characteristics.
work team A group whose individual efforts 
result in performance that is greater than the 
sum of the individual inputs.
Types of Teams
Teams can do a number of things, such as make products, provide services, 
negotiate deals, coordinate projects, offer advice, and make decisions.9 In 
this section, we first describe four common types of teams in organizations: 
problem-solving teams, self-managed work teams, cross-functional teams, and virtual 
teams (see Exhibit 10-2). Then we will discuss multiteam systems, which take a 
broader perspective, suggesting that a “team of teams” interacts within and 
across organizations. Interest in multiteam systems is becoming increasingly 
widespread as work increases in complexity.
10-2 Contrast the five types of 
team arrangements.
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 333 14/12/22 4:13 PM334 PART 3 The Group
Problem-Solving Teams
Problem-solving teams such as quality-control teams have been in use for many 
years. Originally seen most often in manufacturing plants, these were perma￾nent teams that generally met at a regular time, sometimes weekly or daily, 
to address quality standards and any problems with the products made. For 
example, direct-to-consumer watchmaker Vincero employs a full-time quality￾control team that hand-checks every manufactured watch the company pro￾duces.10 Also, the use of problem-solving teams has expanded into other arenas 
such as the medical field, where they are used to improve patient care services. 
Problem-solving teams like these rarely have the authority to implement their 
suggestions unilaterally, but if their recommendations are paired with imple￾mentation processes, some significant improvements can be realized.
Self-Managed Work Teams
As we discussed, problem-solving teams only make recommendations. Some 
organizations have gone further and created teams that also implement solu￾tions and take responsibility for outcomes. For example, self-managed teams 
are used in the thirteen practices of the O’Brien Veterinary Group in Chicago, 
where they autonomously decide how to solve problems that arise and share 
what they have learned from their experiences with the other work teams.11
Self-managed work teams are composed of employees who perform highly 
related or interdependent jobs and who take on some supervisory responsi￾bilities.12 Typically, the responsibilities include planning and scheduling work, 
assigning tasks to members, making operating decisions, taking action to solve 
problems, and working with suppliers and customers. Fully self-managed work 
teams even select their own members who evaluate each other’s performance.
When these teams are established, former supervisory positions take on decreased 
importance and are sometimes eliminated. However, with a lack of authority and 
accountability, teams may spend valuable time and resources aligning team mem￾ber values and goals to “get on the same page”.13 As the founder of the O’Brien 
Veterinary Group notes, it is often difficult for managers to give up this kind of con￾trol: “It requires building a team of adults who want to handle problems and staying 
the course when things go sideways. The temptation to grab control back is big.”14
Research findings on the effectiveness of self-managed work teams have 
not been uniformly positive. Some research indicates that the effectiveness 
of self-managed teams is contingent on the degree to which team-promoting 
behaviors are rewarded. For example, when team members perceive that 
economic rewards such as pay are dependent on input from their teammates, 
performance improves for both the team members and the team.15
A second area of research has been the impact of conflict on self-managed 
work team effectiveness. Some research indicates that self-managed teams are 
not effective when there is conflict. When disputes arise, members often stop 
cooperating and power struggles ensue, leading to lower group performance.16

However, other research indicates that when members feel confident they can 
speak up without being embarrassed, rejected, or punished by other team 
members—in other words, when they feel psychologically safe—conflict can be 
beneficial and boost team performance.17
Thirdly, research has also explored the effect of self-managed work teams on 
member behavior. Here again the findings are mixed. Although individuals on 
teams report higher levels of job satisfaction than other individuals, studies indi￾cate they sometimes have higher absenteeism and turnover rates. Furthermore, 
one large-scale study of labor productivity found that no evidence supported the 
claim that self-managed teams performed better than traditional teams with less 
decision-making authority.18 Finally, some research suggests that in the absence 
of controlled supervision, leaders may “over-emerge”; in other words, people 
who are not very effective as leaders can take control more readily.19
Cross-Functional Teams
Tech companies like ExtraHop and Ixia have been working to implement 
teams that bring employees from information technology (IT) and security 
operations (SecOps) to work together. As a result, they can meet cybersecurity 
objectives and, in so doing, consolidate their tool sets, break down silos, and for￾malize and automate their collaboration.20 These examples illustrate the use of 
cross-functional teams, teams made up of employees from about the same hier￾archical level but from different work areas who come together to accomplish a 
task. Organizations have used cross-functional teams for decades, and we would be 
hard-pressed to find a large organization or product launch that did not use them.
Cross-functional teams can occasionally be an effective means of allowing peo￾ple from diverse areas within or even between organizations to exchange infor￾mation, develop new ideas, solve problems, and coordinate complex projects. 
However, due to the high need for coordination, cross-functional teams are not 
simple to form and manage. Why? First, different expertise is needed because 
the members are at roughly the same level in the organization, which creates 
leadership ambiguity. A climate of trust thus needs to be developed before lead￾ership emergence (see the chapter on leadership) can happen without undue 
conflict.21 Second, the early stages of development are often long because mem￾bers need to learn to work with higher levels of diversity and complexity. Third, 
it takes time to build trust and teamwork, especially among people with different 
experiences and perspectives. Finally, organizations characterized by flat struc￾tures with evenly dispersed power (see the chapter on organization structure) 
may derive the least benefit from cross-functional teams. In these structures, dis￾persed power leads to longer conflict resolution processes, but more compelling, 
the flatter structure reduces the need for cross-functional teams as employees 
usually already have processes in place to coordinate and share knowledge.22
In sum, the strength of traditional cross-functional teams is the collabora￾tive effort of individuals with diverse skills from a variety of disciplines. When 
the unique perspectives of these members are considered, these teams can be 
very effective. However, the ambiguity, conflict, and complexities surrounding 
the formation of a cross-functional team can lead to issues in their success. One 
study of nearly one hundred cross-functional teams across twenty-five major 
corporations found that they had a success rate of only 25 percent.23 Can any￾thing be done to improve their success rate? One solution is to develop a cer￾tain type of cross-functional team, a portfolio governance team (PGT), in which 
team leaders from different functions and who govern different teams work 
together to accomplish tasks.24 Once these teams are up and running, they can 
accomplish the same aims as cross-functional teams, but with the power of the 
teams each leader oversees and with less opportunity for conflict. Outside PGTs, 
cross-functional teams can also be made more successful by: 25

employees from about the same hierarchical 
level but from different work areas who come 
together to accomplish a task.

1. Establishing an accountable leader who is responsible from the team’s for￾mation to its dissolution.
2. Ensuring that each team has established goals, resources, and deadlines.
3. Establishing a clear mission for the team that acts as their main objective.
4. Continuously reevaluating the team and its progress toward success.
5. Reconsidering the usefulness of the team if it is unsuccessful.
Virtual Teams
The teams described in the preceding section do their work face-to-face, 
whereas virtual teams use technology to unite physically dispersed members to 
achieve a common goal.26 Members collaborate online using networks (e.g., 
via the company intranet), corporate social media, videoconferencing, e-mail, 
and messenger applications—whether members are nearby or continents apart. 
Although the COVID-19 context will probably result in virtual teams becoming 
a permanent fixture of the organizational landscape,27 organizations have been 
successfully leveraging virtual teams for decades. As an example, Cisco relies on 
teams to identify and capitalize on new trends in several areas of the software 
market. Its teams are the equivalent of social networking groups of employees 
from different areas that collaborate in real time to identify new business oppor￾tunities and implement them from the bottom up.28
Virtual teams should be managed differently than in-person teams, partially 
because virtual team members may not interact in the same way. For instance, 
virtual environments differ from in-person environments in the ways they convey 
social cues and foster a sense of distance between people.29 As another example, 
although virtual teams may share more unique information with one another than 
in-person teams, managers should be aware that they may be less open to sharing 
information with one another.30 As such, for virtual teams to be effective, trust is 
very important.31 Management should ensure that (1) trust is established among 
members (one inflammatory remark in an e-mail can severely undermine team 
trust), (2) progress is monitored closely (so the team does not lose sight of its goals 
and no team member “disappears”), and (3) the efforts and products of the team 
are publicized throughout the organization (so the team does not become invis￾ible).32 Managers should also carefully select who will be a member of a virtual 
team because working on a virtual team may require different competencies.33
Multiteam Systems
The types of teams we have described so far are typically smaller, stand-alone 
teams, although their activities relate to the broader objectives of the organiza￾tion. Typically, a single team alone cannot fulfill an organization’s broad objec￾tives. Often, it takes an entire system of teams collaborating with and among 
one another and who contribute in their own ways to realizing the organiza￾tion’s objectives. These systems, deemed multiteam systems, are composed of 
collections of two or more interdependent teams that share a superordinate 
goal. In other words, multiteam systems are a “team of teams.”34
To picture a multiteam system, consider NASA’s plans to send a team of 
astronauts to Mars.35 In order to make this mission a success, countless teams 
of researchers, scientists, professors, engineers, operations employees, ground 
crews, and psychologists are needed. Although the research and operations 
teams, for example, are technically independent, their activities are interde￾pendent, and the success of one depends on the success of the others. Why? 
Because they all share the higher goal of sending the astronauts to Mars.
Some factors that make smaller, more traditional teams effective do not nec￾essarily apply to multiteam systems and can even hinder their performance. One

uses technology to tie together physically

more interdependent teams that share a

study showed that multiteam systems performed better when they had “bound￾ary spanners” whose jobs were to coordinate with all constituents. This reduced 
the need for some team member communication, which was helpful because it 
reduced coordination demands. 36 Conversely, some members may emerge as 
“boundary spoilers,” who can hinder effective coordination when they commu￾nicate inaccurate perspectives or practices to members of other teams. 37 Some 
teams within a multiteam system may also have different perspectives that actu￾ally hinder effective communication and coordination; in these instances, these 
teams could benefit from training in which all teams adopt the same perspec￾tives or assumptions (e.g., “getting on the same page”). 38
 Relatedly, employees can, in some cases, identify with either their own team 
or the multiteam system as a whole. When multiteam systems are first established, 
strong identification to one’s own team can lead to conflicts between teams—by 
developing an identification with the multiteam system as a whole, conflicts can be 
reduced, and the performance of the whole system can be improved. 39 However, 
identification with the multiteam system as a whole can be a “double-edged sword”; 
it can also lead to uncertainty regarding which norms to follow and role expecta￾tions across teams (see the chapter on foundations of group behavior) , ultimately 
leading employees and their teams to become depleted and perform worse as a 
result. 40 Multiteam systems may also enjoy higher performance when planning is 
decentralized, but they may also have more problems with coordination. 41 
 Leadership of multiteam systems is also much different than for stand-alone 
teams. While leadership of all teams affects team performance, a multiteam 
leader must both facilitate coordination between teams and lead them. 42 Teams 
that receive more attention and engagement from the organization’s leaders 
may feel more empowered, which may make them more effective as they solve 
their own problems. 43
 An Ethical Choice 
 The Size of Your Meeting’s Carbon Footprint 
Despite being in different coun￾tries or even on different 
continents, many teams in 
geographically dispersed locations 
communicate without regularly meet￾ing in person, and their members may 
never meet each other outside a vir￾tual context. Although the merits of 
in- person versus virtual communica￾tion have been debated, there may be 
a strong ethical argument for virtual 
teams. 
 Keeping team members where they 
are as opposed to having them travel 
every time they need to meet may be 
in line with corporate social responsibil￾ity (CSR) initiatives. A very large propor￾tion of airline, rail, and car transport is 
for business purposes and contributes 
greatly to global carbon dioxide emis￾sions. When teams are able to meet 
virtually rather than in person, they dra￾matically reduce their carbon footprint. 
 In a globally connected world, how 
might you minimize your organization’s 
environmental impact from business 
travel? Several tips might get you 
started thinking about ways that virtual 
teams can be harnessed for greater 
sustainability: 
1. Encourage all team members to 
think about whether an in-person 
meeting is really necessary. Try to 
utilize alternative communication 
methods whenever possible. 
2. Communicate as much as pos￾sible through virtual means. This 
includes e-mail, telephone calls, 
and videoconferencing. 
3. When traveling to team meetings, 
choose the most environmentally 
responsible travel methods pos￾sible. Also, check the environmen￾tal profile of hotels before booking 
rooms. 
4. If the environmental savings are 
not enough motivation to reduce 
travel, consider the financial sav￾ings. According to one survey, busi￾nesses spend about 8 to 12  per￾cent of their entire budget on travel. 
Communicating electronically can 
therefore result in two benefits: (1) 
It is cheaper, and (2) it is good for 
the environment. 44

Creating Effective Teams
10-3 Identify the characteris￾tics of effective teams.
Teams are often created deliberately but sometimes evolve organically. For 
example, tech startup teams are often started naturally by friends; in Noam 
Wasserman’s research of over ten thousand tech startups, nearly 40 percent of 
founders were friends before going into business.45 Interestingly, being friends 
increases the likelihood of failure, and for each additional friend on the found￾ing team, Wasserman suggests, the likelihood of the founders leaving the startup 
increases by nearly 30 percent.46
Many people have tried to identify factors related to team effectiveness. To 
help, some studies have organized what was once a large list of characteristics into 
a relatively focused model.47 Exhibit 10-3 summarizes what we currently know 
about what makes teams effective. As you will see, it builds on many of the group 
concepts introduced in the previous chapter. We can organize the key compo￾nents of effective teams into three general categories. First are the resources and 
other contextual influences that make teams effective. The second relates to the 
team’s composition. Finally, process and state variables are events within the team 
that influence effectiveness. We will explore each of these components next.
In considering the team effectiveness model, keep in mind two points. First, 
as we have discussed, teams differ in form and structure. The model attempts to 
generalize across all varieties of teams but avoids rigidly applying its predictions 
to all teams.48 Use it as a guide. Second, let us consider what team effectiveness
means in this model. Typically, team effectiveness includes objective measures 
of the team’s productivity, managers’ ratings of the team’s performance, and 
aggregate measures of member satisfaction.
Team Context
In this section, we discuss five of the contextual factors that most significantly relate 
to team performance: adequate resources, leadership and structure, culture and climate, 
a performance evaluation and reward system that reflects team contributions, and crises 
and extreme contexts. Although technology/virtuality, interdependence, and norms 
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 338 14/12/22 4:13 PMUnderstanding Work Teams CHAPTER 10 339
are also included under context in Exhibit 10-3, they have already been discussed 
earlier in this chapter and in the chapter on foundations of group behavior.
Adequate Resources Teams are part of a larger organization system; every work 
team relies on resources outside the group to sustain it. A scarcity of resources 
directly reduces the ability of a team to perform its job effectively and achieve 
its goals. As one study concluded after looking at thirteen factors related to 
group performance, “perhaps one of the most important characteristics of an 
effective work group is the support the group receives from the organization.”49
This support includes timely information, proper equipment, adequate staffing, 
encouragement, and administrative assistance.
Leadership and Structure Teams cannot function if they disagree on who is to 
do what and do not ensure that all members share the workload. This requires 
leadership and structure, either from management or from team members 
themselves.50 Beyond initiating structure for team members, leaders play criti￾cal motivational roles for team members. For example, well-performing teams 
tend to have leaders who are transformational (see the chapter on leadership) 
and empowering.51 Furthermore, the relationship between the leader and their 
team member followers has been found to be more important for job attitudes, 
job performance, and turnover intentions than the relationships between team 
members themselves.52 Furthermore, it is important for these relationships to 
be similar and equitable; if leaders “play favorites” with particular team mem￾bers, this can have a detrimental effect on group processes and states.53
Culture and Climate As will be discussed in the chapter on organizational culture, 
culture (e.g., organizational values, beliefs, and assumptions) and climate (e.g., 
organizational policies, practices, and procedures) are very important in organi￾zations. However, teams can have their own cultures and climates that influence 
their effectiveness. For example, one study of teams within a Taiwanese technology 
company found that team climates that promote collaboration can lead teams to 
become more motivated and creative.54 Earlier research on team climates specifi￾cally focused on policies, practices, and procedures related to team effectiveness. 
These studies suggest that a shared sense of vision, a sense of being able to share 
and collaborate in a nonthreatening environment, a concern for performance 
quality, encouragement of creative and innovative solutions, and practicing regular, 
frequent interaction are the most important factors for team climate.55 Research 
in bank teams in Spain and research and development (R&D) teams in Australia 
has supported the importance of these factors for teams, with strong team climates 
leading to increased team financial performance (e.g., sales made) as well as inno￾vation performance (e.g., speed to innovation, project completion).56 Over the 
past decade, more research has examined the effects of different climates in teams. 
For example, perceptions of fair and just policies, practices, and procedures have 
proved very important for team attitudes, conflict, and performance.57
Performance Evaluation and Reward System Individual performance evalua￾tions and incentives may interfere with the development of high-performance 
teams. So, in addition to evaluating and rewarding employees for their individ￾ual contributions, management should utilize hybrid performance systems that 
incorporate individual rewards to recognize individual contributions and group 
rewards to recognize positive team outcomes.58 Group-based appraisals, profit 
sharing, small-group incentives, and other system modifications can reinforce 
team effort and commitment. Furthermore, when instituting a performance 
management system, constructive feedback can have a positive effect on team 
performance.59 However, one should take care to avoid bias and discrimination 
in implementing a team reward system: Research demonstrates that teams com￾posed of primarily Black employees tend to be stigmatized to a greater degree 
(and paid less) than those composed of White employees.60
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 339 14/12/22 4:13 PM340 PART 3 The Group
Crises and Extreme Contexts Crises and extreme contexts are a crucible in which 
the merits of teams can be put to the test. These contexts can unlock the poten￾tial of team members who do truly great things under stress. They can also lead 
to the unraveling of the team fabric, resulting in disaster. As an example, in the 
Mann Gulch fire of 1949, dozens of smokejumpers (i.e., elite firefighters who are 
airlifted to fight wildfires) led by foreman “Wag” Dodge were dispatched to an 
area south of the Mann Gulch valley in Montana after a lightning storm caused a 
wildfire.61 Illustrating how quickly crises can escalate and unravel a team, Dodge 
saw the fire was moving toward them at six hundred and ten feet per minute with 
thirty-foot high flames. The team turned around and headed up the 76 percent 
grade mountain toward the ridge. They were quickly losing ground, and Dodge 
yelled for everyone to drop their tools, lit a fire in front of them, and told them 
to lie down in the area he had burned. No one listened, and they all ran for the 
ridge. Dodge lived by lying down in the ashes of his escape fire.62
Disasters and extreme contexts alike have attracted a lot of research attention 
from OB researchers in the past several decades. From astronauts in long-duration 
space missions to health professional teams responding to crises during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, teams may find themselves in extreme, disastrous contexts 
and must act quickly together to perform their duties.63 Research on multiteam 
systems in disaster environments demonstrates that people tend to default to gath￾ering information rather than taking action—when they do take action, they do so 
without deliberately considering the context or options or even forming a plan.64
Several factors play a role in influencing team success during crises. Leaders are 
extremely important—just consider Dodge’s role in the Mann Gulch fire. Leaders 
are most effective during disasters when they support team problem solving, are 
supportive of the team members, initiate structure and planning, delegate, and 
coordinate as well as help team members make sense of the situation.65 Structure 
also plays an important role. Team scaffolds (i.e., fluid, underlying structures that 
establish role types, shared responsibilities, and boundaries in teams) have been 
shown to help support coordination during crises because they establish account￾ability, a shared understanding, and a sense of identity or belonging.66 Indeed, this 
fluidity and flexibility are important for teams in crisis, as higher-performing teams 
tend to be adaptable and exhibit few, short, and simple interaction patterns.67 As 
for individual team members during times of crisis, positive affectivity (PA; see 
the chapter on personality and individual differences) can help buffer the nega￾tive impact of the strain of the crisis situation.68 Finally, informed decision making 
is critical, as team members should know where to target decision making (e.g., 
toward the problem or the coordination of team members), how to share informa￾tion effectively with team members, and when to reflect on team objectives, pro￾cesses, and strategies before acting.69
Team Composition
Maria Contreras-Sweet, former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, said, 
“When I’m building a team, I’m looking for people who are resourceful. I need 
people who are flexible, and I really need people who are discreet.... Discreetness 
also speaks to integrity.”70 These are good qualities, but not the only ones we should 
consider when staffing teams. The team composition category includes variables that 
relate to how teams should be staffed: The abilities and personalities of team members, 
allocation of roles, diversity and cultural differences (see also the requisite chapter on 
diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations.), size of the team, and members’ prefer￾ences for teamwork. As you can expect, opinions vary widely about the type of mem￾bers leaders want on their teams, and some evidence suggests that compositions may 
be more or less important at different stages of team development.
Abilities of Members It is true we occasionally read about an “underdog” team 
of mediocre players who, because of excellent coaching, determination, and 
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 340 14/12/22 4:13 PMUnderstanding Work Teams CHAPTER 10 341
teamwork, beat a far more talented team. But such cases make the news precisely 
because they are unusual. A team’s performance depends in part on the knowl￾edge, skills, and abilities of individual members.71 Abilities set limits on what mem￾bers can do and how effectively they will perform on a team. Research suggests 
that a number of groups of abilities are helpful to be an effective team member, 
namely conflict resolution, collaborative problem solving, communication, goal set￾ting, and planning abilities/skills.72 In general, despite being weakly related to team 
performance, complementary backgrounds (e.g., education level, area of expertise, 
and abilities) also tend to be more strongly related to innovation and creativity in 
practice.73 It is also worth noting that, over time, the experiences of team mem￾bers add up to improve performance by enhancing the way problems are solved 
as members learn to work together.74 In other words, team members develop their 
knowledge, skills, and abilities—learning how to work with one another over time.
Personality of Members We demonstrated in the chapter on personality and 
individual differences that personality traits significantly influence behavior. 
Some dimensions identified in the Big Five personality model are particularly 
relevant to team effectiveness.75 Conscientiousness is especially important to 
teams.76 Conscientious people are good at backing up other team members and 
sensing when their support is truly needed.
What about the other traits? Teams that are more agreeable tend to perform bet￾ter. The level of team member agreeableness matters, too: Teams do worse and are 
less cohesive when they have disagreeable members, and a wide span in individual 
levels of agreeableness can lower productivity.77 Open team members are willing to 
share more ideas with one another, which makes teams composed of open people 
more creative and innovative.78 Teams confronted with task conflict will likely per￾form better when they are composed of members with high levels of emotional stabil￾ity.79 It is not so much that the conflict itself improves performance for these teams 
but that teams characterized by emotional stability are able to handle conflict and 
leverage it to improve performance. Research is not clear on the outcomes of extro￾version, but one study indicated that a high mean level of extroversion in a team 
can increase the level of helping behaviors, particularly in a team climate of coopera￾tion.80 Beyond the Big Five, recent research has suggested that team proactive person￾ality (see the chapter on personality and individual differences) is important for team 
innovation.81 Thus, the personality traits of individuals are as important to teams as 
the overall personality characteristics of the team.
Allocation of Roles Teams have different needs, and members should be selected 
to ensure that all the various roles are filled.82 A study of 778 major league base￾ball teams over a twenty-one-year period highlights the importance of assigning 
roles appropriately.83 As you might expect, teams with more experienced and

innovation lab of Swiss bank UBS

skills needed to function as a high￾ability team.

M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 341 14/12/22 4:13 PM342 PART 3 The Group
skilled members performed better. However, the experience and skill of those in 
core roles who handled more of the workflow of the team and were central to all 
work processes (in this case, pitchers and catchers) were especially vital.
We can identify thirteen potential team roles (see Exhibit 10-4). Successful 
work teams have selected people to play most of these roles based on their skills 
and preferences and to avoid the four roles that are generally negative for team 
functioning (e.g., dominator, critic, shirker, and detractor).84 On many teams, 
individuals will play multiple roles. For instance, leaders will also likely be motiva￾tors, coordinators, shepherds, and evaluators. To increase the likelihood that team 
members will work well together, managers need to understand the individual 
strengths each person can bring to a team, select members with their strengths in 
mind, and allocate work assignments that fit with members’ strengths. This is espe￾cially a challenge for founding entrepreneurs, given that entrepreneurial teams 
often have similar characteristics and strengths.85
Diversity of Members In the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in orga￾nizations we discussed the nature of diversity in groups and how it affects group 
dynamics within the group. But how does team diversity affect team performance? 
The degree to which members of a work unit (group, team, or department) share 
a common demographic attribute, such as age, gender identity, race, educational 
level, or organizational tenure, is the subject of demography. Demography is a 
term used to describe the level of diversity in groups and teams and suggest that 
attributes such as age or the date of joining should matter for organizations, such 
as in the prediction of conflict.
The logic goes like this: Conflict will be greater among those with dissimilar 
experiences because communication is more difficult. Similarly, the losers of a 
demography The degree to which members 
of a work unit share a common demographic 
attribute, such as age, gender identity, race, 
educational level, or organizational tenure.

conflict are more apt to leave voluntarily or be forced out. 86 A premature conclu￾sion following this logic would be that diversity always negatively affects team per￾formance. However, recall that in the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion 
in organizations we discussed how diversity in groups and teams (e.g., demog￾raphy) initially results in negative outcomes but can eventually lead to positive 
outcomes over time. 87 If the diverse team sticks it out and stays together over 
time, they can reach desirable performance levels. Moreover, they are less likely 
to fall victim to conformity, are more likely to share more information with one 
another, make fewer errors, and may be more creative than non-diverse teams. 88
 Hershey: Advancing Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion Through Groups and Teams 
 The Hershey Company, one of the top 
fifty companies for diversity according to 
Diversity Inc., attributes much of its suc￾cess to its Business Resource Groups 
(BRGs) . These groups are geared toward 
advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion 
(DEI) at Hershey. They accomplish their 
aims through teams that work together 
to attract and retain diverse employees, 
provide business insights to various 
work units, and connect people from dif￾ferent backgrounds. There are a total of 
eight of these groups at Hershey, includ￾ing Abilities First, African American, 
Asian, GenH (Generations), Latinx, Prism 
(LGBTQ), Veteran’s, and Women’s, all 
of which are employee-led and geared 
toward creating a welcoming and inclu￾sive work environment. Together, these 
eight groups comprise a multiteam 
system, all working together toward the 
same goals of DEI. Representatives 
from the BRGs frequently meet with 
hundreds of senior leaders at Hershey 
to provide leadership development for 
facilitating growth and conversation in 
dealing with prejudice, discrimination, 
and emotionally charged current events. 
 They provide a space for employ￾ees to autonomously band together to 
brainstorm new opportunities and pur￾sue DEI objectives with other passionate 
employees. Teams within the BRGs col￾laborate with executive leadership and 
other work units and teams to ensure 
all employees’ interests are represented 
and spearhead company initiatives to ful￾fill the company’s DEI objectives. These 
teams also work to engage new employ￾ees at Hershey. For instance, Jenny 
Fukumoto-Pasko recalls when she started 
as an associate brand manager: “I knew 
I wanted to impact both the business 
and the people. I was a freshly-MBAed 
marketer with diversity, equity, and inclu￾sion on her mind. Within six months, I 
threw myself into two things that fill my 
energy tank to the brim: recruiting and 
empowering women through joining the 
recruitment team and Women’s Business 
Resource Group (WBRG).” The Hershey 
Company is, indeed, a very welcoming 
place for women. Women occupy many 
of the top executive positions within the 
company (e.g., CEO, board chair, chief 
growth officer) and board of director posi￾tions, exactly half of the Hershey work￾force is composed of women, and women 
earn ninety-nine cents on the dollar when 
compared with men. 
 As another example of how BRG 
teams advance their aims, Latinx BRG 
teams collaborate with the Hershey com￾mercial team to connect to the growing 
segment of Latinx customers. As a result 
of these collaborations, Hershey has won 
recognitions and awards for its positive 
portrayals of Latinx people in the media, 
including a “best on-air advertising” 
award from Telemundo for a Mother’s 
Day ad. Teams also collaborate with oth￾ers outside the company. For instance, 
the Latinx BRG collaborates with the 
Latinx Hispanic American Community 
Center’s youth leadership program. Many 
teams volunteer to provide leadership 
development and mentorship to Latinx 
youth. These BRGs capitalize on their 
members’ diverse expertise to place 
them in roles best suited to their abilities 
and backgrounds. For example, in the 
mentorship program, one of the students 
was interested in pursuing a political sci￾ence career. This student was matched 
with the Hershey senior manager of 
government relations, Limer Batista. In 
general, the Hershey Company is a great 
example of how companies can leverage 
both groups and teams to further DEI 
initiatives. 89 
 Toward a Better World 
Cultural Differences We have discussed research on cultural diversity in the chapter 
on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations. For teams, the evidence indicates 
that cultural diversity interferes with team processes, at least in the short term. In 
general, cultural diversity seems to be an asset for tasks that call for a variety of view￾points. But culturally heterogeneous teams have more difficulty learning to work 
with each other and solving problems. The good news is that these difficulties seem 
to dissipate with time. But let us dig a little deeper. Some researchers have found that 
the team benefits of cultural diversity depend upon the team’s cultural composition 
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 343 14/12/22 4:13 PM344 PART 3 The Group
(e.g., majority members versus minority members). Researchers found that cultural 
differences negatively affected team performance for cultural majority members—
however, cultural differences positively affected team performance for cultural 
minority members.90 This suggests that, as teams become more diverse, minority 
members tend to benefit more from the increased diversity than majority members.
Team Size As we noted in the chapter on group behavior, group size is a key char￾acteristic of any group or team. Many experts believe that keeping teams small is 
key to improving group effectiveness.91 Amazon Chair Jeff Bezos uses the “two￾pizza” rule, saying, “If it takes more than two pizzas to feed the team, the team 
is too big.”92 Psychologist George Miller claimed that “the magical number [is] 
seven, plus or minus two,” for the ideal team size.93 The potential connections 
between people grow exponentially as team size increases, thus complicating com￾munications and leading to decreased perceptions of support in bigger teams.94
Experts suggest using the smallest number of people who can do the task. 
Unfortunately, managers often err by making teams too large because they believe 
more people means more benefits (while increasingly underestimating the num￾ber of hours required to complete projects and other losses associated with add￾ing more people).95 When teams have excess members, cohesiveness and mutual 
accountability decline, social loafing increases, and people communicate less.96
Members of large teams have trouble coordinating with one another, especially 
under time pressure. When a natural working unit is larger and you want a team 
effort, consider breaking the group into subteams.97
Member Preferences Not every employee works well in teams. Given the option, 
many employees will select themselves out of team participation. When people 
who prefer to work alone are required to team up, there is a direct threat to the 
team’s morale and to individual member satisfaction.98 This suggests that, when 
selecting team members, managers should consider individual preferences 
along with abilities, personalities, and skills. High-performing teams are likely to 
be composed of people who prefer working as part of a group.
Team Processes and States
The final category related to team effectiveness includes processes (e.g., proce￾dures, activities, and behaviors) and team states (e.g., collective emotional, atti￾tudinal, or motivational states) such as member commitment to a common plan 
and purpose, motivation, team efficacy, team identity, team cohesion, mental models, 
conflict, social loafing, and trust. These characteristics tend to be excellent pre￾dictors of team performance and team member attitudes. They are especially 
important in larger teams and in teams that are highly interdependent.99
Team Processes Why are processes important to team effectiveness? Teams 
should create outputs greater than the sum of their inputs. Exhibit 10-5 illus￾trates how group processes can have an impact on a group’s effectiveness.100
Common Plan and Purpose Effective teams begin by analyzing the team’s mis￾sion, developing goals to achieve that mission, and creating strategies for

achieving the goals. 101 Teams that consistently perform better have a clear sense 
of what needs to be done and how. 102 This sounds obvious, but many teams 
ignore this fundamental process. 
 Members of successful teams put a tremendous amount of time and effort into 
discussing, shaping, and sharing a purpose that belongs to them collectively and 
individually. This common purpose, when accepted by the team, becomes what a 
GPS is to a ship captain: It provides direction and guidance under any conditions. 
Like a ship following the wrong course, teams that do not have good planning 
skills are doomed, executing the wrong plan. 103 Teams should agree on whether 
their purpose is to learn about and master a task or simply to perform the task; evi￾dence suggests that differing perspectives on learning versus performance lead to 
lower levels of team performance overall. Furthermore, engaging in effective plan￾ning processes is also easier when members strongly identify with their team. 104 
 Effective teams show reflexivity , meaning they reflect on and adjust their pur￾pose when necessary. 105 As some examples, reflexivity can help improve psychologi￾cal well-being in manufacturing teams, help startup teams learn from their setbacks, 
help research and development teams innovate, and can help improve perfor￾mance in extreme environments, like hospital emergency rooms. 106 A team must 
have a good plan, but team members need to be willing and able to adapt when 
conditions call for it. 107 Reflexivity is especially important for teams that have had 
poor performance in the past. 108 Some evidence suggests that teams high in reflex￾ivity are better able to adapt to conflicting plans and goals among team members. 109
 reflexivity A team characteristic of 
reflecting on and adjusting the master plan

 Myth or Science? Teams Should Practice Collective Mindfulness 
 T
here is evidence that when indi￾viduals practice mindfulness, it 
can reduce stress and anxiety. It 
can also increase resilience, divergent 
thinking, and job satisfaction and even 
improve focus and leadership flexibility. 
But is it enough for individuals to prac￾tice mindfulness? Will this alone ben￾efit the organization and its teams? The 
answer is that a team’s culture will likely 
be more influential than an individuals’ 
own mindfulness practices. For example, 
even if an individual has developed their 
emotional regulation skills, this will not 
be enough if they are a member of a 
toxic team. 
 This is where collective mindfulness 
comes into play. Collective mindfulness is 
a shared practice among team members 
in which they interact with one another 
with awareness and attention to the 
present experiences. Teams practicing 
mindfulness also engage in nonjudgmen￾tal processing of experiences within the 
team, such as stress about an upcoming 
deadline. Through this practice, a team 
can become more collectively aware of 
the team’s dynamics, objectives, struc￾tures, roles, and tasks. Results from a 
study of team mindfulness indicate that 
the effects of collective mindfulness are 
more significant than if mindfulness was 
practiced by team members alone at the 
individual level. 
 As such, there appears to be a busi￾ness case for collective mindfulness. 
Research shows that the practice of 
collective mindfulness can lead to sev￾eral desirable outcomes for teams. 
These outcomes include creating a 
psychologically safe environment, reduc￾ing relationship conflict within the team, 
better innovation performance, and 
increasing employees’ well-being and job 
satisfaction. 
 How can you lead your team to prac￾tice collective mindfulness? By treating 
it as a team process—as you interact 
with your team, encourage members to 
observe, learn, and experience how your 
team as a unit approaches its tasks and 
goals and critically evaluate its norms. 
To practice collective mindfulness, all 
members need to mutually adjust based 
on this understanding of the team pro￾cesses. By experiencing and learning 
from what the team goes through with 
focus and nonjudgment, this process can 
become routine and reinforced within the 
team over time. 110 
Mental Models The members of an effective team share accurate mental models . In 
other words, they share an understanding of the key elements within their task envi￾ronment. 111 If team members have the wrong mental models, which is particularly 
likely in teams under acute stress, their performance suffers. 112 Teams with shared 
mental models engage in more frequent interactions with one another, are more 
motivated, have more positive attitudes toward their work, and have higher levels 
of objectively rated performance. 113 For instance, teams of firefighters who have a 
 mental model Team members’ shared 
knowledge about the key elements within 
their task environment. 
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 345 14/12/22 4:13 PM346 PART 3 The Group
shared understanding of the tasks they need to perform in an emergency context 
are better able to adapt and act as a group, leading to better team performance.114
If team members have different ideas about the task environment, however, the 
team will misunderstand one another frequently, overlook key aspects of the task, 
or argue over methods rather than complete their work as a unified group.115
Teams should also develop transactive memory systems, which represent the ways 
in which team members collect, integrate, generate, and distribute knowledge to 
develop a shared understanding of their environment.116 For example, structures 
and systems that enable team members to know “who knows what and is best at 
what” ensure that the most-skilled members are assigned tasks for which they are 
best suited and the most knowledgeable are consulted for advice on issues aligned 
with their expertise.117 Transactive memory systems are important for perfor￾mance, especially in collectivist and high-power-distance cultures, for top manage￾ment teams of executives, and in environments that are particularly volatile (e.g., 
times of crisis).118 Without transactive memory systems, the turnover of a particu￾larly critical team member can have devastating effects on team performance.119
For instance, employees in work teams often find themselves scrambling to under￾stand how to perform the work of a coworker who recently left.
An anesthetic team in a hospital is one example of a team in which it is absolutely 
critical to develop shared mental models. Here, a shared understanding of the equip￾ment, technology, tasks, emergency contingencies, team member roles, interdepen￾dencies, and even fellow team members’ communication styles, preferences, habits, 
and quirks is essential to avoid accidental death in the operating room.120 Of course, 
transactive memory systems are also critical for these teams. For example, research 
in Switzerland found that anesthetic teams communicated two distinct types of mes￾sages while in an operation: Vocally monitoring each other’s performance (not to 
criticize but to keep a vocal record of events) and “talking to the room” (announce￾ments to everyone such as “Patient’s blood pressure is dropping”). The study found 
that high- and low-performing teams communicated in these ways equally often; 
what mattered to performance was the sequencing of the communication to main￾tain a shared mental model. High-performing teams followed up monitoring dia￾logue with assistance, instructions, and talking-to-the-room dialogue with further 
team dialogue.121 The message seems simple: To maintain shared mental models, 
communicate about what is happening while the team is in operation!
Team Conflict Conflict has a complex relationship with team performance, and 
it is not necessarily bad (see the chapter on conflict and negotiation). Although 
we have previously described role conflict in the prior chapter on group behav￾ior, we discuss three additional types of conflict in teams in this section.122
Relationship conflict—conflict based on interpersonal incompatibility, tension, 
and animosity toward others—is almost always dysfunctional, especially among 
friends.123 However, when teams are performing nonroutine activities, disagree￾ments about task content—called task conflict—stimulate discussion, promote 
critical assessment of problems and options, and can lead to better team deci￾sions. Finally, a newer form of ethical conflict describes the ways in which team 
members disagree about ethical issues.124 For instance, employees at a customer 
service counter of a grocery store may have different perspectives of the “right” 
and “wrong” way to handle a customer dispute about a coupon.
The positive (and negative) effects of conflict on performance may be smaller 
or larger depending on many factors, such as the task type, the setting, and how 
performance is measured.125 Task conflict is beneficial when members are open 
to experience and emotionally stable.126 Task conflict may also be beneficial when 
some team members perceive high task conflict while other team members per￾ceive low task conflict.127 Moderate levels of task conflict during the initial phases 
of team performance are positively related to team creativity, but both very low and 
very high levels of task conflict are negatively related to team performance.128 In 
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 346 14/12/22 4:13 PMUnderstanding Work Teams CHAPTER 10 347
other words, both too much and too little disagreement about how a team should 
initially perform a creative task can inhibit performance.
The way conflicts are resolved can make the difference between effective and 
ineffective teams. A study of ongoing comments made by thirty-seven autonomous 
work groups showed that effective teams resolved conflicts by explicitly discussing 
the task disagreements, whereas ineffective teams had unresolved conflicts that were 
focused more on personalities and the way things were said.129 Teams experiencing 
early-stage relationship conflict, on the other hand, can rebound and become more 
cohesive after initial conflict if the members engage in cognitive reappraisal, an 
emotion regulation strategy discussed in the chapter on emotion and mood.
130
Which teams are more likely to have conflict than others? It is not a simple 
answer. Some research found that when individual team members varied greatly in 
their perceptions of organizational support, task conflict increased, communica￾tion decreased, and ultimately team performance suffered.131 If the researchers 
had instead compared only the average level of organizational support given to the 
team rather than how members perceived the support, they would have missed the 
correct causal links. Another study of teams found that those high in social capital 
experienced higher task conflict and lower relationship conflict, but this was only 
true after the group had been established for several years.132 Thus, we need to be 
careful not to overgeneralize the effects of composition on conflict.
Perhaps what is more important are the conditions that prompt conflict to 
emerge (e.g., discussing problems and potential solutions is much more likely to 
lead to conflict than talking about off-task topics) and those that resolve conflict 
(e.g., intervention by a supervisor or authority figure).133 For instance, team mem￾ber turnover may inevitably lead to task conflict,134 especially when there is a lack 
of a shared mental model and transactive memory system, as discussed earlier.
Social Loafing As we noted in the prior chapter on group behavior, individuals
can engage in social loafing and coast on the group’s effort when their con￾tributions (or lack thereof) cannot be identified. Effective teams undermine 
this tendency by making members individually and jointly accountable for the 
team’s purpose, goals, and approach.135 Therefore, members should be clear 
on what they are individually and jointly responsible for on the team.
Team States Beyond team processes, emergent states are also critical to team 
effectiveness. These collective attitudinal, emotional, and motivational states 
are important because they guide how team members approach teamwork. The 
context, structure, and processes within a team can all be in place, but without 
positive emergent states, team members may be less motivated to work together.
Motivation Successful teams translate their common purpose into specific, 
measurable, and difficult (yet realistic) performance goals that align with team 
objectives (see the chapter on motivation theory).136 So, for instance, goals 
for quantity tend to increase quantity, goals for accuracy increase accuracy, 
and so on.137 Furthermore, goals intended to improve team member perfor￾mance (instead of team performance as a whole) have the tendency to under￾mine group performance.138 As such, individual goals should be linked to the 
actual goals of the group. Furthermore, motivational factors beyond goals mat￾ter. For instance, beyond goal setting, the actual experience of striving toward a 
goal involves wins, setbacks, and conservation of energy. Teams that are geared 
toward achievement tend to perform better over time.139 Additionally, teams 
that are strategic in how they allocate their resources and energy tend to per￾form better. For example, one study of five National Hockey League (NHL) 
seasons suggests that teams that are strategic in when they bench their most 
valuable players tend to have better end-of-season records than other teams.140
Team Efficacy Effective teams have confidence in themselves; they believe they 
can succeed. We call this team efficacy.
141 Teams that have been successful raise 
team efficacy A team’s collective belief 
that they can succeed at their tasks.
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 347 14/12/22 4:13 PM348 PART 3 The Group
their beliefs about future success, which in turn motivates them to work harder. 
Prior research has demonstrated that team efficacy is strongly predictive of team 
performance, especially when team members are dependent upon one another 
to contribute to team goals.142 The order in which interdependent team tasks are 
completed also matters. In one study of more than three hundred thousand swim 
meets, researchers found that swimmers in the latter part of their teams’ relay 
were more likely to experience increases in motivation when they believed they 
could successfully win the meet for their team.143 In addition, teams that have a 
shared knowledge of individual capabilities can strengthen the link between team 
members’ self-efficacy and their individual creativity because members can solicit 
informed opinions from their teammates more effectively.144
What can be done to increase team efficacy? Two ways might be found in help￾ing the team achieve small successes that build confidence and providing training 
to improve members’ technical and interpersonal skills.145 The greater the abili￾ties of team members, the more likely the team will develop confidence and the 
ability to deliver on that confidence.
Team Identity In the previous chapter on group behavior, we discussed the impor￾tant role of social identity in people’s lives. When people connect emotionally with 
the groups they are in, they are more likely to invest in their relationship with those 
groups. It is the same with teams.146 For example, research with soldiers in the 
Netherlands indicated that individuals who felt included and respected by team 
members became more willing to work hard for their teams, even though as sol￾diers they were already called upon to be dedicated to their units.147 Similarly, when 
team identity is strong, team members who are highly motivated by performance 
goals are more likely to direct their efforts toward team goals rather than individual 
goals. Therefore, by recognizing individuals’ specific skills and abilities, as well as 
creating a climate of respect and inclusion, leaders and members can foster positive 
team identity and improved team outcomes.148 Managers should pay special atten￾tion to fostering team identity in virtual teams. Team identity may be lower in these 
teams, which can lead to lower effort on the part of virtual team members.149
Organizational identity is important, too. Although team identification is often 
stronger than other types of identification, rarely do teams operate in a vacuum—
they are part of a larger organization and interact with other units, teams, and 
people.150 Individuals with a positive team identity but without a positive organiza￾tional identity can become fixed to their teams and unwilling to coordinate with 
other teams within the organization.151 In general, however, team identity serves 
an instrumental role in affecting team performance, attitudes, and cooperation: 
In other words, more positive organizational identification tends to lead to more 
positive team identification, which is beneficial for team outcomes.152
Team Cohesion Have you ever been a member of a team that really gelled, one 
in which team members felt connected? As described in the previous chapter on 
group behavior, cohesion occurs when team members form a shared bond that 
drives them to work together and stay together as a team. Recall from the previ￾ous chapter that cohesive groups and teams tend to perform better than non￾cohesive teams—evidence also suggests the reverse can be true (better performing 
teams can become more cohesive as a result of their successes).153 Experiments 
on astronauts (to prepare for an eventual mission to Mars) in isolated, confined, 
and extreme environments such as those outside of Hawaiian volcanoes has 
found that cohesion tends to break down over several months into missions.154
By studying factors that lead to these breakdowns in cohesion, researchers hope 
to improve astronaut team functioning. Several factors can increase team cohe￾sion, such as sharing leadership responsibilities, open information sharing among 
team members, and interdependence among team members.155
Team Trust During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was clear just how important 
trust is to the successful operation of teams. Lindsay Kaplan, co-founder and 
team identity A team member’s affinity for 
and sense of belongingness to their team.
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 348 14/12/22 4:13 PMUnderstanding Work Teams CHAPTER 10 349
CEO of Chief, recounts life as a virtual manager during this time after a house￾hold emergency with her baby, “I text the marketing team that I’ll likely be late 
to our team meeting... trust in my team is what’s getting me through. I believe 
in hiring slowly, and it’s rewarding to see our carefully curated team operate 
self-sufficiently.”156 Trust in teams entails a mutual, positive state of positive 
expectations between team members.157 When you trust a team member, you 
believe in their reliability and dependability and are genuinely concerned for 
their welfare (and vice versa). Team trust evolves over time as members share 
with one another, put effort into the team, and monitor one another’s perfor￾mance.158 Team trust has been shown to have a sizeable effect on team perfor￾mance, especially in virtual teams.159 Furthermore, research conducted with a 
sample of professional firefighting teams suggests that team trust can help serve 
to buffer the negative effects of the demands of the job on stress and strain.160
Furthermore, although trust can be broken; research suggests that it can also be 
repaired.161 Leadership plays a key role in facilitating trust and trust repair, and 
is important in facilitating team performance and creativity.162
Turning Groups of Employees into Teams
Many organizations have historically gone to great lengths to hire, train, and 
reward team members given how important teams are to the success of orga￾nizations. As some examples, Don Yaeger (author and associate editor at Sports 
Illustrated) notes that organizations wish to hire people “who think team first”—
instead of those who engage in self-centered behavior.163 Search and rescue 
teams have also engaged in team training in order to hone team processes that 
lead to successful search and rescue missions.164 Dental teams have also imple￾mented team bonus plans in order to reward team performance.165
Selecting: Hiring for Team Effectiveness
Some people already possess the interpersonal skills to be effective in teams.166
Therefore, managers, when hiring team members, try to be certain that candi￾dates can fulfill their team roles as well as technical requirements.167 As discussed 
in this chapter, a number of personality traits, abilities, and other characteristics 
lead to effective team performance—managers should be sure to hire applicants 
who have the highest potential to perform well in a team and strategically place 
them in teams where they are most likely to work well with the other team mem￾bers.168 Instead of hiring and placing individual members into teams, some man￾agers are also engaging in cluster hiring, or the selection of an already-existing 
team to work in a new role.169 This practice enables managers to circumvent the 
“growing pains” associated with forming a team from scratch, although such a 
practice involves a significant investment and risk if the team is large and its costs 
are expensive. Finally, given that remote work is becoming increasingly prevalent 
in the modern working world, managers would do well to select employees for 
virtual teams with the skills needed to excel in these environments (e.g., leader￾ship, decision-making, interpersonal, and analytical skills).170
Training: Creating Effective Teams
Training specialists conduct exercises that enable teams to perform more effec￾tively by learning relevant team skills and practices. A large body of research sug￾gests that team training is effective at improving team member attitudes, team 
processes, and cognitive aspects like developing shared mental models and that 
these findings generalize to particularly important industries (e.g., medical ser￾vices).171 Especially important to team functioning, teams should be trained to 
develop shared mental models and transactive memory systems. Unfortunately, 
most companies suggest they struggle with this, and eighty-three respondents 
10-4 Explain how organizations 
can create effective teams.
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 349 14/12/22 4:13 PM350 PART 3 The Group
to one survey indicated that they had problems accessing the information they 
needed to do their jobs. As Vishal Sharma, CTO at SearchUnify (an AI search 
platform) notes: “A company ... that doesn’t promote knowledge management 
also demotivates employees... if first- and second-line managers don’t provide 
the latest technology to share knowledge and ensure visibility, workers end up 
feeling that the whole process is pointless and draining.”172 Virtual transactive 
memory systems are incredibly important, especially in this new paradigm of 
remote work where people do not meet in person as often as they once did. 
The COVID-19 pandemic highlights how quickly teams need to learn new skills, 
develop new knowledge, or learn how to work with one another in different ways. 
Siobhán Griffin, chief people officer (CPO) at Aer Rianta International (ARI, an 
airport retail holding company) recalls that “when COVID-19 hit, it hit aviation 
and travel retail hard. ARI, like all businesses needed to adapt quickly, to react 
and get ahead of the uncertainty. And we did just that... we developed clear 
plans and team training, which enabled us to re-open our stores, safely.”173 Team 
training is not just a one-time activity—the need for team training evolves over 
time, and managers would do well to keep a pulse on teams’ training needs in 
their organizations.
Rewarding: Providing Incentives for Exceptional Teams
A traditional organization’s reward system must be reworked to encourage coopera￾tive efforts rather than competitive ones.174 As Ashira Prossack, an internationally 
renowned business coach, notes, rewarding teams has the benefit of providing a 
common goal that every team member can work to achieve and gives each member 
an opportunity to be recognized. Overall, rewarding teams builds a more united 
bond and encourages the team to work together.175 A number of companies offer 
team rewards, and not all of them are financial. For instance, Nick Vukmaravich, 
director of Sales of Pingboard, headquartered in Austin, uses experiences as team 
rewards. If the sales team meets the sales goals, they have been rewarded in the 
past with prizes like a full day touring the Texas wine country.176 John Rampton, 
founder of the Calendar productivity tool, recalls how during the pandemic virtual 
celebrations like parties and movie nights have been great ways to maintain cohe￾sion and reward team performance. Rampton notes, “A friend told me he’d had a 
virtual ‘happy hour’ with his team in the last few weeks, and everyone came! That’s 
every single employee—unheard of before this mess.”177

M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 350 14/12/22 4:13 PMUnderstanding Work Teams CHAPTER 10 351
It is usually best to set a cooperative tone as soon as possible when setting rewards 
for teams. Teams that switch from competitive to cooperative motivations do not 
immediately share information, and they tend to make rushed, poor-quality deci￾sions.178 Conversely, although many managers like to create “friendly competitions” 
between teams to increase motivation and tie these competitions to team rewards, 
they should not be surprised when they get more trouble than they bargained for 
and the team climate shifts toward one that is competitive and full of conflict.
Of course, promotions, pay raises, and other forms of recognition can and 
should be given to individuals who work effectively as team members by training 
new colleagues, sharing information, helping resolve team conflicts, and master￾ing needed new skills. Team-based rewards have been shown to positively influ￾ence team performance, especially when they are distributed based on an indi￾vidual’s level of contribution (rather than equally distributed).179 Again, this does 
not mean individual contributions should be ignored; rather, they should be bal￾anced with selfless contributions to the team. Finally, do not forget the intrinsic 
rewards, such as camaraderie, that employees can receive from teamwork. It is 
exciting to be part of a successful team. The opportunity for personal develop￾ment of oneself and teammates can be a very satisfying and rewarding experience. 
The “experience-based” rewards discussed earlier demonstrate how celebrations, 
opportunities for interaction, and even the roles themselves can be rewarding. 
Ben Affleck and Oscar Isaac, while filming Triple Frontier (about former Special 
Forces operatives and their difficulties in acclimating to civilian life), commented 
on the sense of loyalty, camaraderie, and teamwork they experienced in playing 
those roles (even permeating into their own lives outside their acting team).180
Beware! Teams Aren’t Always the Answer
Teamwork takes more time and often more resources than individual work. Teams 
have increased communication demands, conflicts to manage, and meetings to 
run. So the benefits of using teams must exceed the costs, and that is not always 
possible.181 Because of this, many otherwise effective employees may find them￾selves overwhelmed when there is too much of a focus on teams and teamwork 
or when team demands become excessive. As a result, many employees run into 
issues that can affect their morale (see OB Poll). Effective teamwork, as the name 
implies, requires work: Team members should have the resources to plan, execute, 
and adapt to changing environments; leadership transitions need to be handled 
smoothly, and both motivation and conflict need to be managed properly.
10-5 Decide when to use indi￾viduals instead of teams.
How do you know whether the work of your group would be better done in 
teams? You can apply three tests.182 First, can the work be done better by more 
than one person? Good indicators are the complexity of the work and the need 
for different perspectives. Simple tasks that do not require diverse input are 
probably better left to individuals. Second, does the work create a common pur￾pose or set of goals for the people in the group that is more than the aggregate 
of individual goals? Many service departments of new-vehicle dealers have intro￾duced teams that link customer service people, mechanics, parts specialists, and 
sales representatives. Such teams can better manage collective responsibility for 
ensuring that customer needs are properly met. The final test is to determine 
whether the members of the group are interdependent. Using teams makes 
sense when there is interdependence among tasks—the success of the whole 
depends on the success of each one, and the success of each one depends on 
the success of the others. Soccer, for instance, is an obvious team sport. Success 
requires a great deal of coordination among interdependent players. Conversely, 
bowling teams are not really teams. They are groups of individuals performing 
individually and whose total performance is merely the aggregate summation of 
their individual performances.

 Summary 
 Teams have become an essential part of the workforce and make it possible for 
organizations to meet and transcend their mission and objectives. Unlike groups, 
which merely work toward a common goal or function, teams synergize, change, 
and adapt—working toward an outcome more remarkable than the sum of their 
individual contributions. Working on teams requires employees to cooperate with 
others, share information, confront differences, and sublimate personal inter￾ests for the greater good of the team. The distinctions between problem-solving, 
self-managed, cross-functional, virtual teams and multiteam systems help deter￾mine how team members interact and work together. Several aspects influence 
whether a team is successful or unsuccessful, including the team composition, 
the context in which it operates, the processes through which it accomplishes its 
goals, and collective states that characterize teams’ motivations and emotions. For 
teams to function optimally, careful attention must be given to hiring, creating, 
and rewarding effective teams. Still, effective organizations recognize that teams 
are not always the most well suited for accomplishing some goals or objectives. 
Sometimes, work is better accomplished by individuals than by teams. 
 Implications for Managers 
● Always start with the work to be accomplished. Begin 
with the mission, goals, and nature of the work to be 
completed and determine whether the work is best 
accomplished by individuals, groups, or teams. 
● If a team is essential for fulfilling a particular mis￾sion or set of goals, select a team type or struc￾ture best suited toward meeting that goal. 
● Sometimes, multiple teams are needed, and 
managers should consider how they will interact 
and coordinate. 
● Managers need to establish contexts in which ef￾fective teams can flourish. By providing adequate 
resources to teams to fulfill their objectives, devel￾oping strong leadership and structure (essential 
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 352 14/12/22 4:13 PMUnderstanding Work Teams CHAPTER 10 353
in crises), monitoring and rewarding team perfor￾mance, and establishing policies and practices that 
ensure mutual trust among team members, manag￾ers can nurture the conditions for team success. 
● Building a team is incredibly complex, and it is 
difficult to predict how they will fare over time. 
Managers can do their part by keeping team size 
relatively small (between five and nine members 
is ideal) and taking the personality, preferences, 
and abilities of team members into account when 
building the team. Also, managers should match 
these individual differences to the work to be 
done, allocating roles to members who are best 
suited to these individual differences. 
● Although team diversity can initially hurt team 
performance, sometimes teams experience “grow￾ing pains” as members learn to interact with one 
another. As a manager, do your best to support 
the team during these times, especially if the team 
will be interacting with one another long-term. 
These early investments may pay off in a cohesive, 
synergistic team that can leverage diverse strengths 
and experiences to meet organizational demands. 
● Team leaders play a vital role in creating 
processes that guide the team toward effective 
performance. Ensure team leaders establish a 
common plan and purpose, set aside time to re￾flect on and adjust this purpose when necessary, 
make sure team members are “on the same page” 
in the team (e.g., shared mental models), and 
appropriately resolve conflict and issues of social 
loafing when needed. These leaders should also 
foster a sense of motivation, efficacy, identity, co￾hesion, and trust in their teams. 
● Select individuals who have the interpersonal 
skills to be effective team players, provide train￾ing to develop teamwork skills, and reward indi￾viduals for cooperative efforts. 
● Do not assume that teams are always needed. 
When tasks do not benefit from interdepen￾dency, individuals may be the better choice. 
 Team Building Exercises Are a Waste of Time 
POINT 
I
t is easy to see why team-building exercises have become so 
popular. They are usually advertised as exciting or fun activities 
for the entire office, such as bowling nights or ropes courses, 
that offer an escape from the office. However, the reality is that these 
exercises are often extremely costly and do not live up to their goals 
of building team relationships and improving collaboration. Some 
may be convinced by the enthusiastic testimonials, but in reality, the 
research indicates that team-building interventions do not have a sig￾nificant effect on team performance (when conducted in a large-scale 
and entertainment-centric way). Furthermore, research has found that 
managers should be more focused on enhancing individual motiva￾tion to create effective teams. While strong relationships and trust are 
essential for collaboration, they are not necessarily the starting point. 
 Unfortunately, any potential benefits of team-building activities are 
often short-lived and soon forgotten when employees return to their day￾to-day work. While teams can be valuable and necessary, there is such a 
thing as an overemphasis on collaborative activities. Data from the past 
decade shows that the time spent by managers and employees involved 
in collaborative activities has grown by 50 percent or more. Rather than 
focusing so much time and money on team-building exercises, organi￾zations would be wise to monitor and recognize when collaborative work 
is needed. By allocating team tasks and purposefully forming teams, 
they can prevent an overabundance of team tasks that can leave em￾ployees feeling burned out and stressed. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 T
eam-building exercises may have a groan-worthy reputation 
for many employees, but that does not mean we should do 
away with them altogether. In fact, they can be quite effective 
if they are implemented correctly. Team-building exercises have been 
found to improve team processes and states. Team building is also 
particularly effective at improving affective outcomes, including trust 
and team potency (e.g., team self-efficacy—a belief shared by team 
members that their group can effectively achieve their goals). These 
exercises are very different than the type of team-based activities that 
are simply fun, advertised in popular culture. But if only implemented 
on a one-off basis, they may only lead to temporary improvements in 
team performance. 
 Instead, effective team-building exercises focus on the needs rel￾evant to a specific team. Furthermore, they include discussion and 
experiences that facilitate self-discovery, lead to concrete action 
plans, and involve accountability for team members meeting the ac￾tion plans. It also appears that investing in team training that includes 
improving social support and conflict management can be worthwhile. 
These improvements can enhance the functioning of a team, which 
in turn can positively impact the team performance. Thus, companies 
should devote resources toward properly conducting team-building 
activities based on needs and that are a part of a continuous team 
performance management system. In so doing, they may find that they 
can be valuable in improving team performance and effectiveness. 183

CHAPTER REVIEW
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
10-1 What is the difference between a group and a 
team?
10-2 What are the five types of team arrangements?
10-3 What conditions or contextual factors 
determine whether teams are effective?

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
Teamwork is a pivotal part of the modern workplace. 
Unlike work groups, teams are meant to create a level of 
performance greater than the sum of individual efforts. In 
this chapter, you learned some of the reasons a team may 
be successful or unsuccessful in meeting this goal based on 
the team’s context and composition, emergent states that 
direct effort and behavior, and various processes the team 
goes through. A solid understanding of how to build a strong 
team and be a valuable team member can help you per￾form better in any team environment, from virtual to cross￾functional teams and beyond. In this chapter, you improved 
your critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and leadership 
skills by learning how to communicate with team members 
in an eco-conscious way, how to engage in collective mindful￾ness processes as a team, how to organize groups and teams 
to advance DEI efforts, and how to debate the utility of team￾building exercises. In the following activities, you will fur￾ther develop these skills, along with your self-management 
skills, as you critically evaluate which team structure to adopt 
when building teams following an acquisition of a local start￾up, how to respond after being excluded or ostracized on a 
team, and how to build trust on virtual teams.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Should You Use Self-Managed Teams?
Break into teams of four or five. Assume you work for a 
large tech company that has recently acquired a local 
startup firm with more expertise in a market your company 
is trying to enter. To utilize employees from the startup 
fully, you are forming new teams with members from the 
parent company and the newly acquired firm for your 
R&D division. Many of the employees from the startup 
were part of self-managed teams before the company was 
acquired. You must decide whether to adopt a traditional 
management style or allow the teams to be self-managed.
Questions
10-6. Answer these questions as a team. What issues 
could affect the productivity of a self-managed 
team? Are these issues likely to occur in a team 
with members from different companies? How 
could these issues be related to members from a 
new company? How could these issues be resolved?
10-7. Answer these questions as a team. How would you 
change, if at all, the reward structure for perfor￾mance if the team were self-managed? Why?
10-8. Each member of the team should explain what 
aspects of the team they would allow team mem￾bers to self-manage if they were a supervisor in 
this company. Then, as a group, compare your re￾sponses. Does everyone agree on what duties and 
responsibilities should be self-managed, or are 
there differences? If you could, would you make a 
team fully self-managed? Why or why not?
ETHICAL DILEMMA When Your Cycling Skills Matter!
Within the Foodtech Industry Landscape, ordering and 
delivering platforms, marketplaces, and channels have 
come to the fore. Of particular interest are the case of 
Deliveroo and Uber Eats and the business model they fol￾low. In the UK marketplace, food delivery is a big market 
that was elevated to an almost essential service during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Many restaurants and takeaways 
have their in-house delivery service, but they will not al￾ways cater to all areas within a given city. Restaurants or 
takeaways that do not have an in-house delivery service 
may be at a severe disadvantage against the competition. 
Deliveroo and Uber Eats offer a solution by providing de￾livery services for all restaurants and takeaways that sub￾scribe to them, with a wider delivery radius and coverage 
enabled by their cyclists. These cyclists can deliver food 
orders to most locations within a city. But how do team￾work and performance figure in the new model?
To begin with, the model is a largely self-managed set-up. 
Riders are classed as self-employed contractors who are not 
entitled to protections granted to employees and “work￾ers.” They are not entitled to collective bargaining rights. 
Nevertheless, they are part of a team and of the broader 
M10_ROBB0025_19_GE_C10.indd 354 14/12/22 4:13 PMUnderstanding Work Teams CHAPTER 10 355
company’s group. They are paid a flat rate for every order 
they deliver, and they can work flexible hours (with the 
bonus of keeping their bodies physically fit!). Therefore, 
the ones who accomplish the most deliveries will get a good 
day’s earnings. It isn’t always as simple as that, of course; for 
instance, the deliveries may be at great distances from each 
other, reducing the number that can be accomplished over a 
given period, and the weather can slow down deliveries and 
thus restrict the earnings of the day for individual cyclists.
Supervision over self-management and self-sustained 
contractors can be challenging with regard to overall 
group performance, but the way the reward system works 
could provide further positive reinforcement for better 
performance individually and therefore as a unit of a 
particular group setting. But perhaps the most interesting 
aspect here is the matter of trust in the working relation￾ships between the cyclists and their supervisor—how these 
are built and sustained is the big question.184          
Questions
10-9. Would you consider the Deliveroo and Uber Eats 
model a work-group or a work-team environment? 
Justify your answer based on the characteristics of 
groups and teams.
10-10. What type of group or team are cyclists working 
for a supervisor for Deliveroo? Justify your answer.
10-11. In the cases discussed above, where do you think you 
would perform better, and why? Justify your answer 
by taking into account efficiency factors, reward sys￾tems, the context, and your individual perceptions.
CASE INCIDENT Psychological Safety and Team Effectiveness
Anyone who has had to work in a team knows that team￾work and collaboration are not always easy. Simply put￾ting people into groups and giving them autonomy does 
not necessarily make them an effective team. Because self￾directed teams are increasingly being used across different 
industries, understanding how to improve team effective￾ness is crucial. This is especially important for companies 
whose business relies heavily on such teams and their cre￾ativity and innovation—for instance, Google.
Google has sought to foster a collaborative working 
culture by minimizing organizational hierarchy and bu￾reaucracy, and it strives to attract the best talent by offer￾ing various employee benefits like generous leave policies 
and flexibility, even the opportunity to use 20 percent of 
their time at work on self-devised projects. Yet in 2012, 
the senior management team was concerned to find that 
teams across the organization showed hugely varied levels 
of performance. To discover the secret of a perfect team, 
Google launched Project Aristotle, named after a quote at￾tributed to him: “The whole is greater than the sum of its 
parts.” Working with researchers from Harvard Business 
School, the project team analyzed a huge amount of sta￾tistical and interview data, tracking 180 teams of different 
sizes over a period of two years. They tested a range of 
factors, including personality traits, interests, educational 
background, and the role of rewards and incentives.
What they found was that the key factors of successful 
teams were not about the individuals but the team environ￾ment and the processes of working together. The greatest 
difference to team performance was made by “psychologi￾cal safety.” Initially coined by Amy Edmondson, a professor 
at Harvard Business School, psychological safety is about 
creating a safe team environment that allows members to 
take interpersonal risks. What fosters psychological safety 
is empathy, encouraging healthy and fair debates, equal 
opportunity to discuss different opinions, and importantly, 
ensuring a no-blame culture where team members believe 
that they would not be punished, rejected, or ridiculed for 
making mistakes or voicing wrong opinions. Commenting 
on the results of Project Aristotle, Paul Santagata, the then 
head of industry at Google, remarked that Google’s suc￾cess is based on a willingness to take risks and to display 
vulnerability before one’s peers. The project identified, 
among others, four key elements of high-performing 
teams: dependability within the team, which is about trust￾ing and being able to rely on others; structure and clarity 
of tasks; standards and expectations; and the meaning and 
impact of the work that the team is doing.
Of course, while this kind of “perfect team” may work 
for Google, scholarly debates about what improves team 
performance continue to rage. In today’s global world, it is 
particularly important for companies to consider whether 
the same factors of effective teamwork apply in different 
parts of the world and in different countries—with differ￾ent cultures within them. While it may seem that the project 
was done a long time ago, the relevance of its findings, and 
the emphasis on the importance of psychological safety in 
particular, was again illuminated after the outbreak of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. With much work disrupted and em￾ployees still dealing with the workplace of the “new nor￾mal,” psychological safety has become even more impor￾tant as hybrid or remote teams strive to find ways to work 
effectively. Understanding what psychological safety would 
look like in the context of new work and hybrid teams re￾mains an interesting area for current research and an im￾portant consideration for most organizations.185
Questions
10-12. Why do you think psychological safety was identi￾fied as key to increasing team performance? You 
can draw on your experience of being in a team to 
illustrate your answer.
10-13. Why do you think teams and organizations some￾times find it difficult to create psychological safety?
10-14. How do you think psychological safety can be 
improved in teams?

 WORKPLACE COMMUNICATION: TOO MUCH OF 
A GOOD THING? 
I
t wasn’t long ago that communicating with colleagues meant gathering 
around a table for a meeting or chatting next to the water cooler. But 
times have changed, and the pace of that change has accelerated due to 
COVID-19. On a typical day, the digital agency Manifesto has only about 20 
of its 45 staff in the office. The rest are elsewhere but still working on the 
same projects, using collaboration tools such as Slack, Trello, Confluence, 
and Google Drive. Collaborative working is not new, but how it is being done 
is thanks to readily available, inexpensive, user-friendly tech tools. Even 
e-mail is becoming passé, with apps like Yammer and Google Hangouts 
increasing in popularity. 
 The range of methods of communication available today is almost 
overwhelming, but is communication itself getting more effective and 
efficient in modern organizations? Or is there too much of a good thing? 
Proponents of high-tech business communication tools cite improvements 
in productivity, idea generation, employee engagement, and speed 
of decision-making, among many other benefits. But not everyone is 
convinced. Others claim it creates stress and decreases productivity 
because of communication overload and constant disruptions and even 
increases bullying and harassment. Furthermore, these tools may not 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 357 21/12/22 6:49 AM358 PART 3 The Group
have significantly reduced the barriers to effective communication as 
is commonly believed. In a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 
respondents to a survey said that communication barriers are leading to 
delays or failures in completion of projects (44 percent), low morale (31 
percent), missed performance goals (25 percent), and even lost sales 
(18 percent).
And what about social media in the workplace? The pros and cons are 
similar. Properly used, the positives include potential gains in productivity, 
better employee engagement, a wider audience reach outside the firm, 
reinforcement of organizational culture, and effective dissemination of the 
company’s vision. When used by senior executives, social media can help 
communicate the financial and strategic direction of a company, attract 
potential employees, and retain current ones. Used badly, social media in the 
workplace can be nothing more than a major distraction, an encouragement 
to cyberloaf, and a security risk for both the employee and the organization. 
Consider these two examples:
When a branch manager at an industrial supply company tweeted criticism 
of the company’s choice of holiday gift for the Christmas Season, a barbecue 
scraper and sauce, he was fired before New Year’s Day. When questioned, 
the company’s CEO confirmed that the employee was terminated and said 
that the company’s policy about acceptable standards of conduct is given to 
every employee and posted on the company website. News of the firing went 
viral and prompted a backlash on social media, with many customers saying 
they would no longer buy from the firm.
In another widely publicized case, despite having the highest possible 
security settings on her Facebook profile, Angela Gibbins was dismissed for 
gross misconduct from the British Council after publishing an offensive post 
about Prince George. An employment tribunal upheld the dismissal, finding 
that she had breached her employer’s advice on social media use, that 
employees should be cautious about what they post even if the message is 
intended to be private.1
Communication is the primary means through which people connect with 
one another. Communication is not only used to transmit a message or 
impart meaning—it is also used to bond and forge connections with others. For 
instance, Shelley Zalis (CEO of The Female Quotient [FQ]) has created The 
FQ Lounge, which has connected more than 17,500 women in the corporate 
world.2 According to Jocelyn Greenky, CEO of Sider Road, this network has 
enabled women to find their voice and “build circles of trust with one another.”3
It may surprise you that communication includes both the transfer and the 
understanding of meaning.4 Communicating is more than merely imparting 
meaning; that meaning must also be understood. In ideal communication, a 
thought would be perfectly understood by the person receiving the message 
communication The transfer and the 
understanding of meaning.
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 358 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 359
exactly how the sender would have intended. Communication across all con￾texts, however, is imperfect and less than ideal, with barriers systematically and 
inevitably curtailing the effectiveness of communication through misunder￾standing and other obstacles. As a student of organizational behavior (OB), 
understanding communication processes and barriers can help you become 
more aware of how to diagnose communication breakdowns and fix them. In 
this chapter, we will explore communication in the modern workplace. We will 
learn more about communication processes and their implications for OB, 
including virtual communication, knowledge management, cross-cultural com￾munication, and employability.
Interpersonal Communication
How you approach communicating with others (e.g., using oral, written, nonver￾bal modes of communication) in organizations can greatly enhance or detract 
from the way the perceiver reacts to the message. For example, consider a doc￾tor at a hospital in California who informed a 78-year-old man (surrounded by 
his family) that he was unlikely to survive his illness. You may picture the doctor 
gently comforting the family of the dying man. However, the family was outraged 
that the doctor sent a rolling medical assistant robot to deliver the news instead.5
Clearly, certain modes are highly preferred for specific types of communica￾tion. However, we often do not have control over how we communicate with 
others, as the stark reality of COVID-19 has taught us. Regardless, we need to 
think first of the components of effective interpersonal communication and 
consider oral, written, and nonverbal communication as tools within our com￾munication toolkit—strategically and purposefully focusing on each of these 
tools when determining how to effectively communicate with others.
Oral Communication
When most of us think of communication, we most likely immediately jump to 
oral communication. We might first think of virtual (e.g., Zoom, Google Voice, or 
WhatsApp calls) or in-person conversations and discussions we have with oth￾ers or their more formal counterpart, meetings. We might also think about the 
speeches our fellow coworkers or leaders give to convey information or motivate 
us to unite toward accomplishing a common goal.
Synchronicity When we think of oral communication, we often assume synchron￾icity, with both the sender and receiver present, aware, and focused on the com￾munication exchange.6 The advantages of this synchronous communication are 
speed, feedback, and exchange. Regarding speed, we can convey a message and 
receive a response in minimal time. If the receiver is unsure of the message, 
rapid feedback allows the sender to detect and correct it quickly. The exchange 
given through oral communication has social, cultural, and emotional compo￾nents. Social exchange, in which we purposefully share social exchanges that 
transcend cultural boundaries, can build trust, cooperation, and agreement 
between individuals and teams.7 As a part of this exchange, communication part￾ners develop a rhythm and rapport, matching each other’s communication styles 
(even in writing!).8
However, given the advent of technological advances in communication (which 
we discuss throughout this chapter), it may surprise you to learn that oral commu￾nication can also be asynchronous communication, with verbal messages sent and 
received outside a physically or psychologically present communication exchange.

M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 359 21/12/22 6:49 AM360 PART 3 The Group
For instance, whenever you check your voicemail, you are engaging in asynchro￾nous oral communication (although many now claim voicemail is “officially dead” 
and many people no longer rely on it).9 As another example, many companies and 
leadership are now filming update messages that are viewed by employees on their 
own terms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, Hans Vestberg (Verizon 
CEO) and Christy Pambianchi (Verizon HR leader) frequently filmed videos 
where they communicated to employees, company-wide and asynchronously, how 
the company was addressing the challenges of the pandemic.10
Conversations, Discussions, and Listening Regardless of whether we are psycholog￾ically and physically present when communicating with others, we should acknowl￾edge that we are usually bad listeners. We are often prone to “listener burnout,” 
in which we tune the other person out, think about what we are going to say next, 
or rush to offer advice. Sometimes, stressors also lead us to listener burnout more 
quickly; when we are preoccupied with other things going on in our lives, it is diffi￾cult to be fully present in conversations.11 Not all conversations and discussions are 
stimulating and energizing as well—people are motivated to avoid conversations 
that they expect to cause conflict or that infringe upon their privacy.12
Conversations and discussions not only have an immediate effect on how peo￾ple take in and respond to information—they also impact how people store and 
integrate knowledge and make sense of their environments. For instance, con￾versations and discussions can influence (for better or worse) our shared mental 
models and transactive memory systems (see the chapter on teams), which are 
important for how we work together as dyads, groups, or teams.13 Conversation is 
critical to developing these effective systems. It has the potential to make an impact 
beyond the team context, influencing entire departments and organizations.14 For 
example, research on site visits of globally distributed teams has shown that they are 
critical in enabling remote coworkers to familiarize themselves with others styles, 
personalities, interests, roles, and the cultural context in which they work.15
However, it is also a double-edged sword—conversation and discussion can 
also be wildly ineffective. For instance, they can lead people to recall less impor￾tant material than if they were thinking about the subject alone (e.g., think of 
how often you forget to bring something up in a conversation with someone 
else—even when you have a meeting agenda!), to ignore topics or items that are 
not brought up during the conversation (e.g., focus too narrowly on only what 
was discussed in the conversation), and to engage in audience tuning (i.e., fram￾ing and representing the information to be exchanged in the discussion to the 
conversation partners), which can turn the attention away from important pieces 
of information.16 As an example of audience tuning, a conversation between 
Burger King encourages conversa￾tions and discussions among its 
executives. Shown here, from left, 
are executives Jonathan Fitzpatrick, 
Jose Tomas, and Daniel Schwartz 
communicating in their work area at 
company headquarters in Miami.

research-and-development executives and a CEO may lead to being enamored 
with possibilities and the cutting edge: a conversation “tuned toward” develop￾ment and advancement that possibly ignores logistical and financial obstacles.
A final, major disadvantage of oral communication surfaces whenever a 
message must pass through several people: the more people, the greater the 
potential distortion. If you have ever played the game Telephone, you know the 
problem. Each person interprets the message in their own way. The message’s 
content, when it reaches its destination, is often very different from the original, 
even when we think the message is simple and straightforward. For example, in 
product development teams, the engineers may often be so far removed from 
the customers that they end up building something (often quite well) that does 
not match the customers’ expectations.17 In these situations, the teams receive 
communications filtered through a number of layers without ever meeting with 
the customers themselves—prompting many organizations to turn to engineer￾ing teams who can effectively work with clients and be savvy engineers.
“Good listeners overcome their natural inclination to fix the other’s prob￾lems and to keep the conversation brief,” said Professor Graham Bodie.18
Active listening—in which we actively engage in sensing and processing others’ 
communication messages (both subtle and overt) and then responding in ways 
that show we are actively engaged in the conversation—helps us become more 
present in our oral communication.19 Research suggests that improving active 
listening can result in more effective communication. For instance, one study 
on customer service employees in a Fortune 500 company found that active lis￾tening training led these employees to better understand customers’ needs and 
perspectives, increased their sense of self-efficacy and confidence, and reduced 
their anxieties during difficult customer interactions.20
In addition to active listening, reflective listening (i.e., acknowledging, restat￾ing, or reformulating others’ messages to provide nonjudgmental affirmation 
and encourage them to further elaborate or share) can also help us become 
better listeners.21 Reflective listening enables you to show others they have your 
attention, helps build trust, encourages them to confide in you, and increases 
the chances you will not miss anything important in the conversation.22 When 
conversing with others who hold different opinions than you, showing that 
you are receptive to their standpoints through reflective listening can dampen 
potential conflict, lead them to see you as a better collaborator, and increase 
their intentions to collaborate with you in the future.23 Although research sug￾gests that reflective listening can be developed through training, merely using it 
does not always lead to more effective communication.24 Indeed, reflective lis￾tening is a skill and at times an art, when the listener needs to decide when and 
where it is appropriate to use. For instance, sometimes reflective listening can be 
as subtle as a nod of encouragement, a “yes, I understand,” or an “I see”; some￾times it is as direct as a “Here’s what I think you are saying...”25 Furthermore, 
it is possible that reflective listening may backfire26 when we use it too much or 
inappropriately in a business context. The key is that once it seems clear that 
both parties have an accurate understanding of the message, the conversation 
should be moved toward problem solving or setting action items.
In Exhibit 11-1, we break down the listening process and demonstrate how active 
and reflective listening can be employed during the process. By using both, manag￾ers and employees may become better listeners. For instance, follow-up questions 
from active or reflective listeners leads them to be better liked by their conversation 
partners and seen as more effective leaders.27 Furthermore, the quality of conver￾sational flow can also lead to improved employability outcomes. Research on job 
seekers has shown that an ability to maintain a quality conversational flow is linked 
to networking success, building strong job contact networks, and leading conversa￾tional partners to be more interested in forming connections with them.28

 Myth or Science? Better Listening Is the Key to Better Working 
Relationships 
 Believe it or not, the human brain 
only takes 0.07  seconds in a 
conversation to form an initial 
impression of another person. In other 
words, we decide whether to trust 
people we meet extremely quickly. 
That initial impression then influences 
how we respond to them. Furthermore, 
when we sense a potential threat in 
a conversation, our amygdala (a part 
of the brain’s limbic system) signals 
our brain to enter protection mode. 
This process results in the release of 
several hormones, such as cortisol. 
When too much cortisol is released, 
the result may be an inability to engage 
and connect with others. We are more 
likely to be emotional and impulsive 
and are inclined to perceive situations 
negatively. 
 However, when we have conversa￾tions that encourage cooperation and 
understanding, a different set of hor￾mones, including oxytocin, are released, 
reinforcing a bonding experience. When 
we have these types of conversations, 
we can build lasting relationships at 
work. The keys to better conversations 
and, as a result, better relationships 
are indeed in the choices we make in 
the way we listen. Rather than listen￾ing evaluatively or with a defensive 
attitude, the key is listening to connect 
with the other person. Also important 
is the element of psychological safety. 
People need to believe that they will not 
be punished or humiliated if they make 
a communication mistake. Although 
you likely will not find a dedicated 
course on listening in most business 
schools, it is an essential skill for lead￾ers and employees. Taking the time to 
develop our listening skills helps us 
build relationships with others in the 
workplace. 29   
Meetings Meetings are often thought of as formal discussions or conversations 
that include two or more people and take place in almost any venue (virtual or in 
person). 30 Although millions of meetings take place in the United States daily 31
and dozens of hours are spent in meetings on a weekly basis, 32 most people hate 
them yet begrudgingly acknowledge that they are necessary. Indeed, an Adobe 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 362 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 363
study of thousands of workers noted that “wasteful” meetings (58 percent) and 
unexpected phone meetings (32 percent) were two of the top three factors that 
“get in the way of your work” while at the same time indicating that they are the 
most effective forms of communication available.33 The negative effect of meet￾ings has been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many employees battling 
“Zoom fatigue” with seemingly endless virtual meetings throughout the week.34 So 
many companies try to make them more effective: Amazon meetings begin with 
30 minutes of attendees silently reading their meeting memos and agendas to 
themselves, Shopify and Asana have “no meeting days,” and some organizations 
limit the duration of meetings.35 Indeed, research on effective virtual teams sug￾gests that the best teams work in bursts—meeting to coordinate and communicate 
but then moving toward long periods of uninterrupted “deep work.”36
Research suggests that several aspects of meetings have implications for OB. 
For instance, some researchers have framed satisfaction with meetings as a facet 
of job satisfaction (see the chapter on job attitudes) that contributes to how 
much people like their jobs overall.37 The interpersonal dynamics within the 
meeting are especially important for meeting satisfaction. People can engage in 
a number of rude behaviors during meetings; nonparticipation (e.g., daydream￾ing) and inappropriate interpersonal behavior (e.g., disrespecting or making 
fun of others) especially affect satisfaction with meetings and their perceived 
effectiveness.38 Beyond incivility during meetings, they can be draining in other 
ways. For instance, surface acting (e.g., inauthentically displaying emotions dur￾ing the meeting that you do not truly feel, like feigning enthusiasm when you 
really cannot wait for the meeting to end) can cause you to become emotionally 
exhausted and to consider quitting.39
The timeliness of meetings matters quite a bit. When meetings start late, par￾ticipants’ meeting satisfaction and effectiveness perceptions suffer, their creativity 
during the meetings suffers, and they may even experience relational conflict.40
Conversely, the meeting may start on time but individual participants themselves 
may be late. These participants may often be those who are dissatisfied with their 
jobs and thinking about quitting, or they just might be low on conscientiousness 
(see the chapter on personality).
41 Regardless, other meeting participants may 
become angry with these late arrivals and willing to punish them.42 However, 
meeting participants are more likely to react with sympathy and support if the 
latecomer’s excuse pointed to something beyond their control.43
How can OB contribute to the conversation of how organizations can make 
meetings more effective? In professor Steven Rogelberg’s book The Surprising 
Science of Meetings, he outlines a number of common suggestions to this aim 
(there are forty-eight outlined in the book in total!), including:44
• Only meet when it is truly needed.
• Gather input from attendees prior to meeting.
• Provide an agenda to attendees.
• Delegate roles to attendees.
• Limit distractions.
• Start and end meetings on time.
Speeches Famed Harvard instructor and executive communication coach 
Carmine Gallo sat across from a famous Silicon Valley CEO who had created 
technology that revolutionized digital storage memory. Gallo asked this CEO, 
“You’re very successful. You’re considered a good speaker. Why do you feel as 
though you need to improve?” The CEO responded: “I can always get better. 
Every point up or down in our share price means billions of dollars in our com￾pany’s valuation. How well I communicate makes a big difference.”45
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 363 21/12/22 6:49 AM364 PART 3 The Group
Executives, managers, and team leaders alike recognize the importance 
of speeches in influencing the motivation, perspectives, and understanding 
of others (often with implications for performance and productivity). As we 
will learn in the following chapter on leadership, speeches are an important 
way in which leaders often communicate their “vision” for where they want 
their company or group to go. Many of us can recall truly impactful speeches, 
from thought-provoking TED talks from management gurus to the exciting 
product reveals from black-turtlenecked tech CEOs, and these speeches serve 
as a form of oral communication that conveys transformational and char￾ismatic leadership.46 These influential speakers convey power through use 
of figurative and abstract language,47 relate on a deeply personal level with 
their audience, and foster a sense of mystery, discovery, and excitement that 
prompts listeners to act.48
However, speeches are not always bombastic performance acts. They vary in 
tone depending on the purpose of the communication episode. One group of 
researchers, for instance, used machine learning approaches to analyze the facial 
expressions and wording used by sixty-one CEOs in emerging markets to ascertain 
their communication styles from publicized interviews and speeches.49 Although 
some CEOs were reliably more “excitable” and “dramatic” (fitting the profile we 
discussed earlier), many others were more “stern,” “melancholy,” or even “ram￾bling.” Sometimes, stern or melancholy tones may be more appropriate—such 
as in the wake of a serious, organizational tragedy. On the other hand, the “ram￾bling” tone tends to be an artifact of the power of leadership, but typically for 
men. Studies of United States senators, for instance, have found that women are 
less likely than men to ramble when they have the floor.50 These women avoid 
talking for too long as they can experience backlash for doing so. This backlash is 
an unfortunate result of prejudice and stereotyping.
Written Communication
Written communication includes letters, e-mail, instant messaging, blogs (dis￾cussed in the next section), newsletters, and any other method that conveys 
written words or symbols. Some of these create a digital or physical long-term 
record, while the advantage of others is quick, fleeting information exchange. 
Although we may take written communication for granted and may assume 
it matters less than we think, even small, incidental forms of communication 
can have a huge impact on, say, employee motivation. For instance, a super￾visor’s words in a narrative comment in the quarterly performance appraisal 
of an employee can drastically affect that employee’s motivation and fairness 
perceptions.51
Furthermore, we often assume that oral communication reigns supreme as 
the most effective—however, distributed remote teams can be effective even 
when they rely almost exclusively on written communication.52 In these teams, 
writing helps make the teams’ thoughts concrete and specific as well as pro￾motes thoughtful reflection.
In this section, we discuss two primary forms of written communication in 
modern organizations: e-mail and text/instant messaging. We conclude with a 
discussion about how natural language processing is revolutionizing the way we 
analyze and make sense of written communication.
E-mail Since the first e-mail ever was sent nearly fifty years ago, the growth of this 
written communication mode has been spectacular. Its use is so pervasive that it 
is hard to imagine life without it. In 2020, there were more than 3.9 billion active 
e-mail users worldwide (more than half of the world’s population) operating 
5.6 billion separate accounts,53 with employees spending an average of three hours 
every day checking e-mail (roughly 37.5  percent of a forty-hour workweek).54
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 364 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 365
Exhibit 11-2 shows the staggering amounts of time that managers 
and professionals spend daily checking their e-mail. Poignantly, 
e-mail has become somewhat of a cultural symbol for stress and 
overload in the modern work world.55
Today, e-mail is so commonplace that it is about equally pre￾ferred to actual in-person communication by workers as the most 
popular form of workplace communication.56 Despite having 
become the preferred method of virtual communication, the 
sheer amount of time employees spend on it inevitably spells trou￾ble for time use, productivity, and performance in organizations.57
However, e-mail has a relatively complicated relationship with our 
emotions. Although e-mail interruptions make us feel bad because 
they increase a sense of time pressure and the feeling that we are 
not meeting our other goals, we also can often feel good about 
being responsive via e-mail, as it may give us a sense of task accom￾plishment.58 The question, however, of whether answering e-mail 
really does amount to task accomplishment is questionable and 
probably depends on the importance of the e-mail.
Regardless, excessive e-mails can lead employees and man￾agers alike to feel “boxed in by [their] inbox,” leading to a per￾ceived lack of goal progress and less time to fulfill their actual 
job responsibilities.59 This is especially of concern for consci￾entious employees—e-mail interruptions prompting them to 
complete a new task may lead them to experience strain when they are fully 
engaged in a separate task.60 But with all of this effort expended toward keeping 
up with e-mail, do managers and employees ever reach “inbox-zero” status (e.g., 
no unaddressed e-mails in the inbox)? Some do, some do not. In 2020, only 
55 percent of office workers managed to reach that point, with the vast majority 
of them experiencing major relief at having done so.61
The ubiquity of e-mail has also led to the emergence of newer forms of uneth￾ical behavior in organizations. First, employees at Enron engaged in deferent 
e-mail communications, yielding to superiors’ preferences because of the power 
differential and the fear of “overstepping one’s boundaries.”62 Employees are 
also more willing to lie via e-mail than in person, given that e-mail is seen as a less 
restrained and personal form of communication than in-person interaction.63
Employees can also be actively or passively rude to one another via e-mail. When 
people experience incivility through e-mail, they are more likely to withdraw 
from their work responsibilities the following week—an effect that also spills over 
to these employees’ significant others, who also withdraw from their own work 
the following week.64 Interestingly, passive rudeness may even be more dam￾aging as recipients try to “figure out” and “read into” what the sender meant, 
leading to insomnia and negative affect at the beginning of the workday.65 In 
general, e-mail incivility has a negative effect on employees, leading to negative 
affect, lowered engagement and energy levels, and performance decrements.66
However, recovery experiences that allow employees to psychologically detach 
from work may be one key to addressing the negative effects of e-mail incivility.67
Given what we know from OB research, how can we handle this incessant del￾uge of information? Researchers and practitioners have a number of suggestions 
to manage your inbox effectively if you are struggling from e-mail overload:68
• Turn off notifications.
• Check your e-mail at regular intervals (exact times during the day—for 
instance, every three hours).
• Immediately move your e-mail out of your inbox after reading.
• Use the search functionality and e-mail filters to find e-mails.
• Use shortcuts to archive e-mails in a small number of categorized folders.

• Single out important e-mails individually; process and treat less important 
e-mails in groups or batches.
• Use “reply all” thoughtfully and only when all people need to receive your 
response (to avoid clogging their inboxes).
• Do not treat e-mail like an in-person dialogue.
• Avoid the temptation to skim or skip e-mails.
• Think before you send.
Instant Messaging and Text Messaging Although instant messaging (IM) and 
text messaging refer to essentially the same activity, there are subtle differences 
between the two.69 Text messaging is, in some ways, a more reliable form of com￾munication than IM as it is tied to people’s wireless and phone services. If the 
person has a phone (and a plan to support it), they will likely be able to send a 
text message—with or without Internet connectivity. An instant message, on the 
other hand, involves sending a message through a third-party chat app or sys￾tem (e.g., Messenger, Teams, Slack). IMs can also be sent through social media 
networks, where they are also sometimes referred to as direct messages (DMs). 
Initially, IMs and text messages were forecasted to shift our reliance on syn￾chronous, in-person interaction to a more asynchronous, offline experience.70
However, the use of this messaging took a different trajectory and is much more 
of a synchronous mode than originally expected.
Unlike e-mail, instant and text messaging have a strong immediacy norm, 
meaning that recipients are expected to respond to incoming messages quickly 
and in a brief, conversational manner. This heightened sense of immediacy 
can increase perceptions of support from organizations, supervisors, and even 
instructors. For instance, when class instructors permit students to IM them 
(instead of e-mail them) outside class, they are perceived as friendlier, more 
approachable, and more available than instructors who are only available via 
more traditional methods.71 Internal research at Slack has shown that this 
immediacy norm may lead to longer times using the app—on average, Slack 
users spend a whopping ten hours a weekday on the application.72
In many IM apps, others can see whether you are online, so they can antici￾pate whether you will respond quickly. Furthermore, “read receipts” have left 
many to feel the painful sting of being “left on read”—that their message was 
not important enough or that the recipient did not care enough to send a 
response after reading.73 Although the attitudes toward these read receipts vary 
(some view them as being unnecessary and invasive, others see them as a way to

proactively prompt them to respond more quickly to others),74 they have cer￾tainly amplified the level of immediacy in IMs. Thankfully, those who view read 
receipts negatively can always turn them off in many messaging apps.
The heightened level of immediacy that comes with texting and IMs can 
also lead to a heightened level of interruptions. In many ways, they are like 
super-charged e-mails—requiring you to be psychologically present to answer to 
others on issues that are often trivial.75 Also, the brief, conversational, and infor￾mal nature of texting and IMs can lead to sloppiness, curtness, negativity, and mis￾understanding from recipients.76 For instance, angry emotions can be conveyed 
through text messages,77 which can sometimes reflect the personality traits of the 
communication partners. People with low levels of agreeableness and emotional 
stability (see the chapter on personality and individual differences) are more likely 
to use negative emotion words in texts and IMs, which can affect the emotions and 
moods of the message recipients.78 Furthermore, some employees and managers 
may view texts and IMs as intrusive and distracting, especially when people send 
messages at unreasonable hours or engage in serial texting in bursts of short mes￾sages that keep receivers’ phones buzzing annoyingly.
In general, employees should be cautious when relying on text messaging and 
IM too much. As professor Lucas Miller, a lecturer at Berkeley University, notes, 
IMs instantly reward us with dopamine any time we get a notification, validating 
our status as an informed and valued member of our “work tribe.” At the same 
time, each notification leaves us anxious and apprehensive. This is because we fear 
being ill-informed or out of the loop if we do not check or respond to the notifica￾tion, even if it does not really require our immediate attention.79
Natural Language Processing Data mining and artificial intelligence (AI) 
approaches to analyzing (and learning from) this data have benefited greatly from 
written business communication repositories. Through natural language processing,
researchers can train algorithms to incorporate the actual words people use in 
e-mail, instant messages, social media, and other written communication media 
(including hashtags) to measure emotions, moods, personality traits, stress, and 
other characteristics of employees.80 The business applications have been nearly 
endless with companies using natural language processing to better understand 
the types of products customers may be interested in (and to advertise accord￾ingly), predict customer sentiment and intentions in real time, detect fraud and 
compliance in accounting, to improve patient experience and diagnostic power in 
medical contexts, intelligently detect sensitive information (and improve cyberse￾curity protection efforts), and even create digital assistants to help teams manage 
tasks.81 The market outlook has been immense as well: By 2025, the market is said 
to exceed $6 billion with a growth rate of 21 percent between 2017 and 2025, and 
the global datasphere (data available for NLP) will grow by a factor of ten, result￾ing in a trillion gigabytes available for NLP.82
Nonverbal Communication
When we deliver a verbal message, we also impart an unspoken message.83 Sometimes 
the nonverbal component may stand alone as a powerful message in and of itself. 
If you read the minutes of a meeting, you would not grasp the impact of what was 
said the same way as if you had been there or could see the meeting on video. 
Why is this so? There is no record of nonverbal communication, and the emphasis 
given to words or phrases would likely be missing. No discussion of communication 
would thus be complete without consideration of nonverbal communication—which 
includes body language and movement, information conveyed through contact 
and our senses, and the physical use of space and time in interactions.84
Nonverbal communication can be unconscious and automatic—when events 
happen, we react and express our emotions, and the bystanders perceiving 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 367 21/12/22 6:49 AM368 PART 3 The Group
our emotions then make appraisals based on the emotional expressions. 85 For 
instance, it may be one subconscious mechanism behind the spread of racial 
bias in the workplace: 86 In one research study, merely watching videos of White 
individuals subtly treating Black individuals poorly prompted observers to adopt 
negative racial stereotypes and form negative impressions of the Black individu￾als. 87 Furthermore, research has demonstrated that body postures and gestures 
can also be stereotypical and prejudice-inducing themselves, with certain poses 
considered more masculine and others more feminine. 88
 Furthermore, the attributions people make about others’ nonverbal behav￾iors are strong and consistent, even when they do not match with reality. For 
instance, even though people may perceive certain nonverbal behaviors (e.g., 
standing up straight and posing) as dominant, they do not always match that 
individual’s “actual” dominant personality traits. 89 Eye-tracking studies on proj￾ect teams found that naive observers who viewed video clips of the teams in 
action gazed more often (and for longer durations) at the team members who 
used more dominant gestures and who had active facial expressions (ultimately 
rating them as more charismatic and emergent leaders). 90
Body Language and Movement We could argue that every body movement has 
meaning and no movement is accidental (though some are unconscious). We 
smile to project trustworthiness, uncross our arms to appear approachable, and 
stand to signal authority. 91 Even something as subtle as a downward head tilt can 
convey specific personality traits and emotions that observers can reliably pick 
up on, 92 and people are capable of “acting out” or “posing” the Big Five traits 
(see the chapter on personality and individual differences) in photographs. 93
Although we often think of specific body movements and facial expressions as 
unique expressions to be considered on their own, we actually tend to evaluate 
the entire person’s body language as a whole. 94
 Body language can convey status, level of engagement, and emotional state. 95
Body language adds to and often clarifies verbal communication. 96 In fact, 
 Is it appropriate and common to use texting for work purposes?

studies indicate that people read much more about another’s attitude and emo￾tions from their nonverbal cues than their words! If nonverbal cues conflict with 
the speaker’s verbal message, the cues are sometimes more likely to be believed 
by the listener.97 In the workplace, body language plays a key role. Body move￾ment also matters. During a communication episode, our attributions of others’ 
intentions may change over time as they act and react. These dynamic changes in 
body language and movement over time lead to differences in our perceptions 
of them.98 In other words, we do not immediately draw conclusions about oth￾ers’ body language that stick—instead, they are updated and revised over time.
Contact and Senses Although we normally think of body language and movement 
when we think of nonverbal communication, our other senses play a major role 
as well. First, sounds and vocal intonations (sometimes called paralanguage) could 
also be considered a sensory form of nonverbal communication that serve as their 
own form of communication beyond verbal messages.99 Why do these subtle differ￾ences in how we say something have a huge impact, even beyond what we say? Some 
researchers suggest that paralanguage serves to persuade and influence others,100
such as how startup entrepreneurs speak with confidence and conviction to con￾vince a potential client to do business with them despite the entrepreneurs’ own 
reservations about their ability to follow through on the arrangement.101
Second, smell and odor are powerful, symbolic forms of nonverbal commu￾nication in the workplace that can elicit a number of emotions.102 A pleasant 
smell (e.g., a scented humidifier in your office) can put you in a positive, focused 
state.103 The scent of coffee from the breakroom can signal that it is the start of a 
long day (or a long night) at the office.104 The interesting thing about odor is it 
is very one-dimensional. People are often not very capable at telling differences 
between scents, but they can tell you one thing: whether it is pleasant or not.105
And it is embodied and present throughout our working lives, whether we are 
working from home or in the office. However, this one-dimensional nature of 
smell can lead to a number of negative outcomes when the smell is disgusting. 
For instance, fishy smells coming from others can lead people to become sus￾picious of those individuals.106 These black-and-white impacts of smell on our 
attitudes and behaviors are problematic because smell more often than not has 
nothing to do with our actual intentions or dispositions.
A final sensory form of nonverbal communication is contact and touch.107
Touch can help provide support during times of loss and need, communicate 
warmth and welcoming, and even lead to improved team performance through 
increases in cooperative intent.108 Handshaking during job interviews is impor￾tant for molding and managing impressions.109 Touch in the workplace is, well, 
a touchy subject, but it is more common than one would think. Some touch and 
contact are required in specific occupations (e.g., doctors, personal trainers, 
hair stylists), and others are normatively appropriate (e.g., tapping someone 
on the shoulder to ask them a question).110 However, touching and physical 
contact at work have become the subject of great scrutiny, with the #MeToo 
movement highlighting inappropriate touching in the workplace111 and the 
COVID-19 pandemic bringing to surface the health risks of physical contact 
between coworkers.112 This scrutiny led to the question of whether contact 
that communicates warmth or intimacy (e.g., hugging) is appropriate in the 
workplace.113 In a recent Robert Half survey of managers and professionals, 
for instance, 65 percent indicated that it is somewhat common to hug cowork￾ers.114 Regardless, employees and managers need to learn and respect one 
another’s boundaries, and when there is physical contact involved, keep a light 
brief touch.115 Moreover, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, other forms 
of physical contact to replace hugs and handshakes have become more popular 
(e.g., fist or elbow bumps).116
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 369 21/12/22 6:49 AM370 PART 3 The Group
Physical Space and the Use of Time Although relatively new to OB, time and phys￾ical space also matter for nonverbal behavior. For instance, how close we stand 
to other people sends subtle communication signals; that we like and accept 
them.117 Research on public school teachers, for instance, found that teach￾ers who took breaks at the same time and taught on the same floor were more 
likely to develop working relationships with one another, especially when they 
shared similar interests and characteristics.118 As another example, research on 
“coworking spaces” (i.e., where independent workers and entrepreneurs rent 
space to work and network together in a shared environment) shows that work￾ing in close proximity with one another plays a role in forming and maintaining 
new organizations and ventures.119 However, sometimes the amount of physical 
space people maintain between themselves and another person is dependent 
upon that person’s mood and approachability.120 For example, you might avoid 
your supervisor when you hear through the grapevine that they are in a clearly 
bad mood.
Speed comprises an important expression cue, with angry motions typically 
displayed as jarring and fast, whereas sad motions are depicted as slow and 
sauntering.121 Furthermore, people tend to view quicker vocalizations and move￾ments as conveying confidence (leading them to be persuaded more easily), 
more so than those that are slower and more deliberate.122 The rapidity and 
delay with which we communicate with others send messages to our conversa￾tion partners. They can communicate that we are prioritizing a certain project 
or issue, or they could also communicate that we are taking our time to carefully 
consider an issue.
Overall, we need to be deliberate and strategic in our management of non￾verbal communications with others. We should look for these cues in others’ 
behavior and be mindful of our own nonverbal behavior when interacting 
with clients, coworkers, subordinates, and supervisors. You should be particu￾larly aware of contradictions between the messages. Someone who frequently 
glances at their wristwatch is giving the message that they would prefer to ter￾minate the conversation, even if they tell you otherwise. We misinform others 
when we express one message verbally, such as trust, but nonverbally communi￾cate a contradictory message that reads, “I do not have confidence in you.” It is 
better to align all forms of communication so that we are more direct in what we 
mean and intend (e.g., “I do not have time to continue the conversation now as 
I might be late to a meeting—can we pick this up later?”)
Choosing Communication Methods
The choice of whether to schedule a meeting or a phone chat or send an e-mail 
or a text is a complicated one. In this section, we describe how to match the 
communication method to the content of the message and how to deal with 
potential barriers to effective communication.
Choosing Communication Methods
Many claim face-time with coworkers, clients, and upper management is the key 
to success. However, if you seek out the CEO just to say hello, you may be remem￾bered as an annoyance rather than a star, and signing up for every meeting on 
the calendar to increase your in-person presence is counterproductive to get￾ting your work done. Your communication choice is worth a moment’s thought: 
Is the message you need to communicate better suited to a discussion? A text 
message? After determining what the norms and guidelines are in your organi￾zation, it might be helpful to match the message to the method. Exhibit 11-3 
presents a guide for choosing a communication method in this way.

Handling Barriers to Effective Communication
Several barriers can slow or distort effective communication. In this section, 
we highlight three of the most important barriers to effective communication: 
information overload, communication apprehension, and crisis situations.
Information Overload Although people integrate information from multiple 
sources to effectively make sense of information,123 individuals have a finite 
capacity for processing data. When the information we must work with exceeds 
our processing capacity, the result is information overload. What happens when 
individuals have more information than they can sort and use? They tend to 
select, ignore, pass over, or forget it. Or they may put off further processing 
until the overload situation ends. In any case, lost information and less effective 
communication result, making it more important to deal with overload proac￾tively. For instance, information overload may cause negotiators to give up on 
the deal more quickly or otherwise jump to conclusions about optimal offers.124
Furthermore, the pressure to interact with multiple people simultaneously (i.e., 
sometimes referred to as multicommunication) can cause people to be inadver￾tently rude with one another, a situation that can quickly spiral out of control.125
But does everyone feel this way? Surprisingly, research over the past several 
decades suggests that most people actually like being overloaded with information 
on a daily basis. Between 2006 and 2016, for instance, the number of people who 
felt information overload decreased from 27 to 20 percent. On the other hand, the 
number of people who like “so much information” increased from 67 to 77 per￾cent.126 Why do people feel this way? This comfort with information overload is pri￾marily attributable to the rise in smart gadgets and devices (discussed later in the 
chapter) that people use to manage large amounts of information. They feel that 
these devices enable them to keep up with demands, determine what information to 
trust more quickly, and have control over their lives.127 Who might the “information 
overloaded” be, then? Some research suggests that the differences might be attrib￾utable to socioeconomic status. Not everyone has access to smart technology (e.g., 
smartphones, smarthomes, digital assistants, tablets, and broadband Internet).128
Managers should consider these disparities in setting communication norms 
in their work groups and teams: Providing technological support and equal 
access to devices can help forge units better equipped to manage large amounts 
of information. Virtual team leaders can also take a structured approach to 
reducing information overload by developing individual and team situation 
awareness (i.e., an individual and collective understanding of the information 
to focus on and prioritize in communication), along with a plan for acting 
on this awareness.129 If you are concerned with information overload in your 
communications, try to reduce the ambiguity and complexity and increase 
the relevance of what you are trying to communicate to others, as these three 
characteristics are most strongly related to information overload.130 If you do 
feel like you are experiencing information overload (and are not liking how 
you feel), it may make sense to connect to technology less frequently or at spec￾ified time intervals to avoid feeling overwhelmed, as we described earlier.131
Communication Apprehension One barrier to effective communication, 
communication apprehension, results when people experience undue tension 
or anxiety surrounding their communication with others.133 They may find 
it difficult to talk with others or become extremely anxious, relying on their 
preferred form of communication (or otherwise abstaining from communica￾tion) when a different method may have been more appropriate. Sometimes, 
communication apprehension stems more from reluctance to use new media, or 
forms of communication or communication media that one is not familiar with.

information inflow exceeds an individual’s 
processing capacity.

tension and anxiety about communication.
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 372 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 373
Communication apprehension has a number of implications to effective 
communication in organizational contexts. For one, it can affect leadership 
emergence in virtual teams. For example, one study found that communication 
apprehension reduced the amount of electronic communication that a person 
engaged in and, as a consequence, the extent to which that person emerged as 
a team leader in the eyes of other team members.134 Communication appre￾hension can also be more or less salient at different times during a person’s 
career. Applicants to jobs that require communication with others (e.g., role-play 
exercises, giving presentations, group interviews) may experience communica￾tion anxiety that may affect the personality attributions interviewers make and 
their overall communication skills scores.135 As another example, new employees 
may be all too familiar with the nervousness and anxiety surrounding communi￾cating with a new supervisor.136 After all, you want to make a great impression!
Learning to regulate and cope with one’s anxiety’s about communica￾tion may be one potential solution. As Theresa Welbourne, professor at the 
University of Alabama’s Culverhouse College of Business, wrote about appre￾hension concerning new media: “This may be a new place for courage to play 
out in organizations. Leaders, managers, and HR need to be courageous and 
take a leap of faith that they will benefit from new media if they plunge into the 
process.”137
Communicating in Times of Crisis The final barrier to effective communication 
can be found in the underlying context: Communication becomes more chal￾lenging during times of crisis.138 As an example, the devastation of Hurricane 
Katrina in August 2005 has been frequently viewed as an exemplary case in 
how crises can be fraught with ineffective and inefficient communication.139
Government agencies at all levels were taken by surprise when confronted with 
the threat of Hurricane Katrina approaching the United States and had diffi￾culty coordinating a response to the crisis as well as coping with the uncertainty 
and ambiguity of the situation.
Effective communication during times of crisis involves breaking down crisis 
response into several stages: (1) communicating in anticipation of or prepara￾tion for crises, (2) managing responses to the crises while they are occurring, and 
(3) communicating with stakeholders after the crisis and catalyzing shared learn￾ing.140 Collective motivations underlying communication change throughout 
these stages: People become driven to take control and dominate during times of 
war, whereas crises during times of peace tend to drive people toward being self￾critical and fearing negative consequences.141 These shifting motivations need 
to be accounted for in crisis communication—control, domination, anxiety, and 
fear are not directly aligned with reassurance and grace under pressure.
What can be done to improve communication during times of crisis? 
Effective messaging that focuses on sharing facts, interpretations of the facts, 
and projections for consequences of actions at all stages can be beneficial.142
Furthermore, although motivations tend to shift more toward power and 
responsibility, people should try to work together in times of crisis instead of 
independently. For example, research shows that people, when trying to solve 
a problem separately (e.g., developing a vaccine for a virus), may become 
overcome by confusion and an inability to learn from one another’s failures—
by coordinating and collaborating, they may be able to overcome the confusion 
and learn from one another.143 Finally, technology can help communicate 
information rapidly and accurately to all those who may be (imminently) 
affected by a disaster, including apps that help provide information quickly 
to response teams.144 Technology can also be used to sound the crisis alarm: 
For instance, a Twitter alert was issued in 2018 for a potential ballistic missile

 Toward a Better World 
 Mobile Citizen and Mobile Beacon: Two 
Companies Enhancing Access to 
Smartphones and the Internet 
 Today, access to the Internet (and, per￾haps, constant access to the Internet 
through smartphones) has become a 
public necessity. For many people, not 
accessing the Internet for an entire day 
would be incredibly disruptive to their 
personal and professional lives. This 
realization is all the more compelling 
when we think of global crises such as 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people 
found themselves in government- or 
self-imposed quarantine, unable to 
venture outside their living spaces. 
The only lifeline to the rest of the 
world came from their devices and the 
Internet. 
 Moreover, many relied on their 
Internet-connected devices for their 
children to continue to learn. Without 
these devices, the students would 
likely fall behind or otherwise not stay 
on pace in their learning progress. Not 
to mention the medical implications: 
Many during the pandemic relied on the 
Internet and smartphones to communi￾cate with their doctors, therapists, and 
healthcare providers. (In fact, 75  per￾cent of psychologists stopped seeing 
their patients in-person entirely.) 
 These realizations have sparked a 
renewed interest in a debate surround￾ing the Internet: Is Internet access a 
right ? Or is it a privilege ? Furthermore, 
what are the roles of the government 
and organizations in providing Internet 
access? In many societies, Internet 
access is commoditized through com￾panies that manufacture smart devices 
(e.g., Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi) and 
Internet access providers (e.g., AT&T, 
Verizon, CenturyLink). However, another 
set of organizations (e.g., libraries, 
nonprofits) have come together with 
the mission of increasing or providing 
complementary or discounted Internet 
access to those in need (e.g., lower￾income employees and their families). 
These organizations (e.g., Mobile 
Citizen, Mobile Beacon) provide the 
same services and technology at a 
cost that is often up to 80 percent less 
per year than popular commercial car￾riers. Some examples of these com￾panies’ programs include the Ashbury 
Senior Community Computer Center, 
which addresses older, limited-income 
adults’ needs with technology access 
and training. Furthermore, St. Paul’s 
“PCs for People” provides tech support, 
computers, and Internet access to low￾income Minnesotan families. 
 The case behind this social mis￾sion is compelling. As one rural Florida 
school teacher noted: “About 21  per￾cent of our students do not have 
Internet access at home. My students 
rely on [Mobile Beacon] to continue 
their schoolwork after our library closes, 
do research online, access school 
resources, or even submit assignments. 
Our community is very rural, and there 
are no free wifi options.” Enhanced 
Internet access also assists employ￾ees with disabilities—as one employee 
in California noted, “I would not have 
access to the outside world to do my 
essentials that healthy people take for 
granted. This affordable service fits in 
my budget because my disability check 
doesn’t stretch very far.” Finally, the 
head of Reference Services at Chicago 
Area Public Library noted that the ser￾vices have “become one of our most 
important programs. Patrons rely on it 
to access information from home: for 
school work, continuing education, job 
searching, or just general Internet use. 
The hotspots connect our members to 
the world around them.” The statistics 
are even more compelling. Thirty-four 
million Americans do not have access 
to the Internet. Forty percent of non￾profits do not have the technology they 
need to do their jobs. About 50  per￾cent of libraries do not offer sufficient 
Internet access. 
 Despite these companies stepping 
in to provide increased access and ser￾vices to those who need them, there is 
a more extensive ethical conversation 
at play. Should Internet access be a 
public utility ? Considerations of feasibil￾ity will likely inform the answer to this 
question. Many note that the private 
infrastructure is unreliable and crum￾bling and question whether public infra￾structure would be an improvement. 
Others suggest that the current state of 
Internet service providers is exception￾ally messy and unsystematic. A uniform 
system would help reach more people 
and clearly define who is “served” ver￾sus “underserved” (which also varies 
across regions). 
 Many communities around the 
United States (more than 500) have 
experimented with these ideas, build￾ing their own publicly owned Internet 
networks that many view as cheaper, 
faster, and more transparent than com￾mercial organizations. A good example 
is Chattanooga, Tennessee. Its high￾speed fiber-optic network (built in 2009 
and run by the “Electric Power Board” 
[EPB]) is consistently ranked as one of 
the best Internet service providers in 
the United States. Many even comment 
that it is the fastest Internet service in 
the entire country, with speeds up to ten 
gigs per second . Regardless, we believe 
these issues will become more salient 
in the years to come and highlight how 
organizations (both private and public) 
can address societal needs. 132
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 374 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 375
threat. However, this alert proved to be a false alarm, and an analysis of the 
1.2 million tweets that followed suggested that anxiety remained heightened 
throughout the week as a result.145 Therefore, people should remain sensitive 
to the impact of their communications on people during crises.
Advancements in Virtual Communication
With innovations in technology, there have also been advances in the ways in 
which we communicate with one another virtually. This has resulted in a num￾ber of virtual channels that differ in their capacity to convey information.146
Some are rich in that they can (1) handle multiple cues simultaneously, (2) 
facilitate rapid feedback, and (3) be very personal. Others are lean in that they 
score low on these factors. As Exhibit 11-4 illustrates, in-person conversation 
scores highest in channel richness because it transmits the most information per 
communication episode—multiple information cues (words, postures, facial 
expressions, gestures, intonations), immediate feedback (both verbal and non￾verbal), and the personal touch of being present. Impersonal written media 
such as formal reports and bulletins rate lowest in richness.
In sum, “media-rich” channels give us multiple opportunities to observe. 
The unconscious aspects of communication help us understand the full mean￾ing of a message. When these aspects are missing, we must look for other clues 
to deduce the sender’s emotions and attitudes.
New virtual communication media are, for the most part high-channel 
“media rich” and include videoconferencing, blogging, vlogging, and podcast￾ing as well as forms of e-collaboration and e-learning.
Videoconferencing
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented number of people 
downloading videoconferencing software and applications. In March 2020 
(the onset of the pandemic in the United States), there were a record 62 mil￾lion downloads of platforms like Google Hangouts Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft 
Teams (up a whopping 90 percent from the pre-COVID average).147 But even

before the pandemic, videoconferencing was on its way to becoming an institu￾tion. For instance, in a 2017 Forbes Insights survey, 80 to 84 percent of respon￾dents said that videoconferencing is the norm for meeting both internally and 
with customers.148 Videoconferencing permits employees and clients to con￾duct real-time meetings with people at different locations. Live audio and video 
images let us see, hear, and talk with each other without being physically in the 
same location. People can also share files or videos with others and broadcast 
these documents through “screen sharing,” which enables everyone to see the 
files on their own devices.
Videoconferencing boasts a number of benefits for team members and the 
organizations that use the technology. For instance, a number of employees sur￾veyed by a videoconferencing company have been able to reduce their business 
travel, become more engaged in their jobs, and view their employers as inno￾vative and successful as a result of their use of videoconferencing.149 As Srini 
Koushik, chief technology officer (CTO) at Magellan Health, put it, videocon￾ferencing “is helping us to build teams across geographies, build a sense of com￾munity, provide the ability to train many people at the same time, host town 
halls—and much more... it’s my belief that video conferencing is one of the 
first things you need to get right for effective collaboration.”150
Despite the increased popularity of videoconferencing, it is clearly not the 
same as an in-person meeting. But frankly, many do not have the choice over 
whether to meet in person or via videoconferencing. Teams and employees are 
becoming more and more distributed across the globe, and it appears video￾conferencing is here to stay.151 What can employees and manager do to leverage 
videoconferencing more effectively? Experts offer the following suggestions:152
1. Be mindful of your nonverbal behavior, just as you would in person. Try 
to look directly into the camera and make eye contact, lean in, nod, and 
do what you can to show you are engaged in the conversation (but try 
not to overdo it). Avoid yawning, stretching, eating, or other distracting 
movements.
2. Set the stage. Adjust your background to keep the focus on you and away 
from distractions. Some may choose to use backgrounds that block out 
background movement and make it easier to focus. Position the webcam so 
it focuses directly on you and not in a way where people cannot directly see 
you talking. Ensure that the lighting is warm and soft enough for people to 
see you and not too jarring.
3. Be aware of the other people on the call. Although it may feel like you are 
alone in your own space, it is helpful to be mindful of the other people on 
the call and leave them space and opportunities to share. Sometimes you 
may experience awkward silence, but resist the temptation to jump in and 
start talking more. Relatedly, keep tabs on how long you have been speaking 
and meeting so you are respectful of others’ time.
4. Leverage (but be sure to test) technology. Videoconferencing offers a number 
of tools and utilities that can effectively enhance collaboration. For instance, the 
“raise hand” function offered in some platforms can enable presentations and 
larger discussions to be held online. Other callers can “raise their hand” to sig￾nal they have a question or comment. Reaction tools can be used to encourage 
and provide feedback to other attendees. The chat window and screen sharing 
functions can be used to share other media or references to drive home the 
points you are trying to make during the call. Finally, it is a good idea to test and 
practice ahead of time—not only make sure that the videoconferencing system 
works, but also test its features.
5. Manage videoconferencing (e.g., Zoom) fatigue. Videoconferencing may be 
stressful and intense at times. (It is not the same as in-person communication, 
after all.) Some solutions may be to minimize your window so that the other 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 376 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 377
people on the call are not dominating the entirety of your screen. Furthermore, 
constantly monitoring yourself in the “self-view” can be draining. If the appli￾cation provides the option, consider hiding the self-view to avoid the tempta￾tion of looking at yourself. A bonus to doing so is that you are more likely to 
focus on others and maintain nonverbal eye contact more effectively.
6. Play with innovative videoconferencing applications. We typically view video￾conferencing as a tool purely for replacing in-person meetings. However, their 
potential applications go so much further than that. Depending upon your 
objectives, you may want to use videoconferencing software for virtual social 
events (e.g., coffee breaks, happy hours), virtual coworking (e.g., working qui￾etly alongside other coworkers on the same project), virtual office hours (e.g., 
setting aside time to welcome impromptu discussions or chats with coworkers).
Blogging, Vlogging, and Podcasting
Although many people monetize blogs, vlogs, and podcasts as solo entrepre￾neurs,153 organizations are also hopping onto this trend and starting their own 
with the hope of connecting and engaging with their audiences. In all three 
cases, increased access to what was once prohibitively expensive audiovisual 
equipment has enabled them to spread like wildfire.
A blog (short for “web log”) is a website by a single person, team, or company 
that is used to share primarily written content with others and engage them. 
Blogging may very well be a business necessity for organizations, so it should not 
be overlooked as a vital form of communication.154 As an excellent example of a 
company that gets blogs right, Intuit QuickBooks, an accounting software used 
for expense tracking and payroll, has a well-organized blog with free resources 
people can use to help them run their businesses.155 The key to successful blog￾ging is engagement and to make your content searchable. This means that peo￾ple looking for advice on how to run their businesses will likely be drawn to the 
content on the blog—while they are there, Intuit might attract new customers 
or at least pique their interest.
Blogging has given way to vlogging, which serves essentially the same func￾tions as a blog, but through a different medium: video. Vlogs are especially use￾ful to connect with customers and clients if your products are used in projects 
(e.g., construction, art), require step-by-step instruction, or sometimes require 
proficiency to use properly. For instance, if your company sells tools, you might 
upload videos on how to use the tools properly. As a great example of a com￾pany with thousands of viewers of its vlog, the magazine Bon Appétit continuously 
updates its vlog with extremely relatable chefs making recipes from their home 
and test kitchens.156 As some viewers described, it is almost like a sitcom with a 
revolving cast of characters: “And so, each night before bed, I check in with the 
chefs at Bon Appétit like I’m catching up with old friends, watching (or let’s face 
it, rewatching) video after video until I pass out. This is comfort food to me.”157
Finally, podcasts resemble mini-radio shows, with people sharing primar￾ily audio content to serve the same function as a written blog, but with more 
emphasis on in-depth discussion and storytelling. The past decade has led to 
a number of truly innovative ways that organizations have sought to inform 
and connect with audiences. For instance, John Deere’s “On Life and Land” 
discusses sustainability, food, farming, and field recordings to really showcase 
its love of the land.158 Trader Joe’s “Inside Trader Joe’s” unpacks life “behind 
the scenes” at the grocery chain and how the company makes decisions behind 
the products it stocks and its sourcing.159 This podcast really enables listeners 
to delve into the many products that have since garnered a cult following. As 
a final example, #LIPSTORIES, a podcast by Girlboss and Sephora, showcases 
inspirational women creatives, thought leaders, entertainers, and entrepre￾neurs, giving them an opportunity to tell their memorable stories to listeners.160

E-collaboration and E-learning
As a final category of communication medium, we turn toward e-collaboration
and e-learning.161 These media essentially build upon corporate social media 
approaches (like the enterprise social software described later),162 but rather 
than being solely devoted to social networking, these media are literal platforms 
through which employees do their work or train to do their work. Although 
e-learning management systems are more common in schools and universities 
(think Blackboard, Moodle, Google Classroom) or outside schools as massive 
open online courses (MOOCs),163 many businesses and millions of employees 
today use e-collaboration software, like Microsoft Teams, Google Workspace, 
and Facebook Workplace. All of these systems allow users to create and share 
content; accomplish work tasks; manage projects, goals, and timelines; orga￾nize as teams; and communicate with one another.164 As an example, Optum 
Healthcare engages its customer care employees in an e-collaboration network 
to crowdsource innovative ideas on how to improve internal processes and 
change benefits packages so they are more attractive to clients.165
Although these technologies are cutting edge and are just now being imple￾mented across major enterprises, decades of OB research have been devoted to 
e-collaboration and e-learning. Are they as effective as in-person collaboration 
and training? With regard to e-collaboration, there are quite a few “moving parts.” 
For one, e-collaboration has implications for how leaders manage and influence 
their followers over time and space.166 In online collaboration, leadership often 
becomes more salient due to the lack of in-person physical cues. For example, the 
effect of leader-member exchange (LMX; see the next chapter on leadership) 
becomes more important for empowering followers (and resultantly for team pro￾cesses) than it would be in person.167 Second, research demonstrates that there 
are a number of qualifications (e.g., motivation, knowledge, attentiveness, and 
composure) virtual team members need to effectively “e-collaborate.”168 Third, 
e-collaboration systems should be monitored to ensure that employees are com￾municating frequently and engaging in quality exchanges with one another.169
E-learning research suggests that its effectiveness depends on how well the 
systems are designed, with most research showing it can be equally effective 
with the right conditions in place (e.g., autonomy, collaboration, feedback).170
Autonomy is especially important in blended formats (i.e., learning that is partly 
in person, partly online), suggesting that people have little control over which 
parts are in person versus online and little personalization regarding the 
in-person aspects.171 However, these blended formats have proven to be fairly 
effective, with people outperforming those learning in person, especially when 
they are provided with feedback and opportunities for collaboration.172
The Currency of Virtual Communication: Emojis, Usernames, 
Selfies, and More
The rise of virtual communication has transformed the ways in which we commu￾nicate with one another. From emojis to memes to expressing ourselves with user￾names and selfies, a new “language” for communicating has developed within 
the span of decades.173 Indeed, research shows that people tend to prefer to 
communicate in “pictures” rather than “words” when separated by time and dis￾tance.174 Perhaps this explains why we are shifting toward using emojis, memes, 
and gifs as communication? However, there are individual differences in the use 
of emojis. For instance, one study of over eighty-five thousand Facebook users 
found that 90 percent of these users regularly communicated with emojis, but 
young, women, and extroverted users tended to use them more than others.175
Furthermore, although they are used by just about everyone, you may want to 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 378 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 379
exercise caution in using emojis in work contexts, at least when you are making a 
first impression. For example, a recent study suggested that using smiley emojis in 
a first impression can lead others to view the user as less competent and to be less 
willing to share information with them.176 It might be best to test the waters first 
and follow the norms of the people with whom you are interacting.
Outside of emojis, abbreviations (e.g., LOL), memes, and gifs, people also 
communicate online in the ways they represent themselves. For instance, peo￾ple’s usernames may often reflect the personality they want to portray to the 
world, but they might not be as accurate as we may think. Researchers stud￾ied thousands of players of a popular massively multiplayer online role-playing 
game (MMORPG) and found that although people were consistent in rating 
what players’ usernames were intending to portray (in terms of Big Five person￾ality traits), these usernames were highly inaccurate windows into players’ true 
personalities.177 Second, people also use selfies to communicate online. Unlike 
usernames, people were fairly accurate in their ratings of others’ personalities 
when viewing their selfies, although less so for agreeableness and their general 
self-esteem.178 But who posts selfies more often, and how do others react to 
them? In general, extroverted individuals are more likely to post selfies than the 
other Big Five personality traits.179 However, it is probably best not to overdo 
it—for instance, one study found that Instagram users who posted selfies more 
often were rated more negatively (e.g., less successful) than those who were 
more judicious.180
Smartphones, Social Media, 
and Cybersecurity
Virtual communication has permeated into (and practically dominated) the 
ways in which people connect with one another at work.181 An estimated 3.5 
billion people use social media (about 45 percent of the world’s population), 
68 percent of U.S. adults use Facebook to connect with others, and the aver￾age adult spends three hours on social media, primarily using mobile devices 
like smartphones.182 Combined with our earlier estimate on e-mail, this equates 
to six hours daily checking e-mail and social media. Worldwide, over 2.5 bil￾lion people own smartphones,183 with about 81 percent of Americans owning 
smartphones.184
The vast number of people using smartphones, engaging with social media, 
and communicating through virtual means has led to a number of effects on 
the way people do work. For instance, new norms surrounding technology use 
and boundaries between work and home life are just one example of the ways 
in which technology has led to transformation (and subsequent conflict and 
stress at home).185 Furthermore, the psychological distance fostered by virtual 
forms of communication can lead us to figuratively perceive others on virtual 
teams as more abstract, less concrete, and “farther away” than if they were sit￾ting across from us in an open-office.186 But despite this psychological distance, 
many younger employees are digital natives—they have grown up with all of this 
technology and are used to interacting with and even receiving emotional sup￾port through technology.187 These and other issues point to technology-aided 
communication in OB as a revolution of sorts188—a major change in how we 
communicate with one another since the turn of the millennium.
In the sections that follow, we describe how smartphones, social media, and 
virtual communication have affected OB. Furthermore, we describe an emerg￾ing issue that has resulted from these advancements, cybersecurity, and what 
organizations are doing to address it.

Smartphones (and Other Smart Devices)
Smartphones are now used by a vast majority of workers and managers in 
organizations. Although some organizations actually employ their own “fleet” 
of devices they loan to employees for work purposes, many organizations 
that encourage smartphone collaboration follow a “bring-your-own-device” 
(BYOD) model, with employees using their personal devices for work purposes. 
Smartphones have led to a number of advancements in the study of OB. For 
instance, they can be used to capture information about situations and contexts, 
uncover communication dynamics between people, determine how people feel 
in different locations, uncover differences between day and night work behav￾ior, and even sense people’s personalities.189 Much of the research in OB on 
smartphones has focused on their impact on stress, health, and well-being. In 
the following sections, we go into more depth on this topic and conclude with 
other “smart devices” that will likely play a larger role in the future workplace.
Smartphones and Stress, Health, and Well-Being Smartphones have enabled 
people to connect with colleagues and perform relational work from just about 
anywhere. However, with this increased connectedness come increased threats 
to employee health and well-being. This situation has resulted in a paradox of 
sorts—although people report that the increased connection gives them a deeper 
sense of autonomy, that they can control when and where they work, they end up 
using it everywhere and all of the time, which actually strips them of autonomy.190
Furthermore, the temptation and distraction of constant connectedness 
have led people to, paradoxically, enjoy in-person interactions less than they 
would without smartphones.191 In fact, one study tracking over a million high 
school students over twenty-five years found that, following the rise of smart￾phone technology in 2012, the happiness and well-being of high schoolers 
decreased steadily over time and that this decrease was not due to the Great 
Recession.192 Many theorists suggest that this is an example of technoference, or 
the ways in which technology interferes with, rather than assists, our lives. For 
instance, they suggest that humans are evolutionarily incompatible with smart￾phones as they draw our attention away from developing meaningful attach￾ments with others.193 However, as we noted earlier, it is not out of the question 
for humans to adapt as digital natives, who forge connections with one another 
electronically. For instance, some evidence suggests that using smartphones has 
caused many to think more abstractly about their work, putting in the work to 
integrate the technology into the various roles they play and explore ways to 
make the situation work for them.194
If we want to fully examine the effect of smartphones during the typical 
workday, we should start with the morning. Research suggests that late-night 
smartphone use can cause employees to start the workday already depleted and 
less engaged because it interferes with their sleep.195 During the day, research 
suggests that work engagement can reduce the extent to which workers bring work 
home with them, thus reducing smartphone use outside working hours.196 Finally, 
smartphone usage can inhibit employees from engaging in the replenishing 
recovery activities they need to reduce strain at the end of the day.197 What can 
we do to limit the extent to which smartphones interfere with our livelihood? 
One large footwear manufacturer uncovered that by permitting employees to 
communicate in the ways they desired and developing norms that are work-life￾balance friendly, organizations may “avoid the trap of constant connectivity.”198
Other Smart Devices Beyond smartphones, a new frontier in OB research 
revolves around smart-homes and digital assistants (e.g., Alexa, Siri), which 
are voice-activated AI that are integrated with other devices in one’s 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 380 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 381
environment. These devices can theoretically be employed in the work and 
home contexts to manage and accomplish one’s work.199 Another advance￾ment that has not been picked up by many organizations (but that shows 
promise) is the use of wearable digital devices and sensors (e.g., Fitbits, smart 
watches).200 For instance, Bluetooth-enabled devices can help keep track of 
team performance and individual performance in real time so employees 
can seamlessly provide assistance to one another when needed (without hav￾ing to ask for help).201
Social Media
Nowhere has online communication been more transformed than in the rise 
of social media. For decades, businesses have been coming to grips with the 
reality of social media—not merely to cope with it but rather to leverage it as 
a part of their strategy. Although we will discuss the use of social media in HR 
applications in a later chapter, businesses are taking advantage of social media 
to discover new trends, connect with existing audiences, reach new audiences, 
garner attention from the public, and build their brands.202 Leaders use social 
media to capture users’ attention, convey information to stakeholders, evan￾gelize people around a common vision, engage in dialogue with stakehold￾ers and people outside the organization, mobilize people around a common 
cause, and strategically direct the flow of information.203 Employees will use 
social media to connect and collaborate with others (although it is also used 
for self-affirmation).204 In the career context, employees use social networks 
like LinkedIn to network and find jobs,205 but they may also use them to voice 
their concerns about the way things are and stand up to perceived unfairness 
and injustice.206
Furthermore, many organizations have developed their own in-house 
social-networking applications, known as enterprise social software, and most have 
their own presence on popular social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and 
Instagram.207 These internal social-networking platforms encourage employees 
to collaborate and to improve training, with some organizations reporting sub￾stantial annual increases in corporate network activity.
Most of Us Use It, but What Is Social Media Anyway? Most social networking 
sites that comprise social media share common features: They contain a pro￾file outlining user information (e.g., pictures, biographies, interests, etc.), a 
network outlining the user’s contacts (e.g., people, public figures, and com￾panies), a stream outlining activity and interaction on the site (e.g., shared 
updates, updates from contacts, communications between contacts and other 
users), and, finally, a message element, which allows users to IM one another.208
When users log in, they can perform a number of activities. They can broadcast 
or view information, receive or give feedback on this information, and engage 
in comparison between these processes and information.209 Through these 
typical, interconnected elements, social media empowers employees, super￾visors, and other organizational figures to organize by sharing information, 
collaborating, and communicating with one another quickly and efficiently.210
Furthermore, the evolution of social media has led OB theorists to consider 
it to be more of a context than a technology. It is a virtual world, similar to in￾person contexts, that affects employees’ emotions, thoughts, and (in-person 
or digital) behaviors.211
You Are What You Post: Personality via Social Media Once we recognize that 
social media is most like a context, we come to understand that social media 
provides a stage upon which personality traits manifest and materialize 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 381 21/12/22 6:49 AM382 PART 3 The Group
(see the chapter on personality and individual differences). For instance, 
researchers have found that people reliably view the use of certain words 
as representative of the Big Five personality factors and are accurately able 
to detect people’s agreeableness, extroversion, and emotional stability 
through their posts.212 Moreover, evidence suggests that this process occurs 
spontaneously—when you are viewing another user’s feed, you automatically 
infer their personality traits from what you observe.213 Furthermore, the 
Big Five personality factors have been linked to more “objective” behaviors 
online, with extroverted people tending to have more friends or followers 
on social media, and these friends were more likely to also be friends with 
each other.214
Beyond the Big Five, OB researchers have been fascinated with the extent 
to which dark personality traits relate to online social media behavior. For 
instance, researchers have linked narcissistic personality traits to the frequency 
of status updates and other social media activity across multiple networks,215
especially when these behaviors are directed toward self-presentation (e.g., 
boasting about the great things going on in your life), social comparison (e.g., 
evaluating how you stack up to your friends and followers) and gaining new 
friends (e.g., obtaining more followers).216 Like the Big Five discussed earlier, 
people are also able to accurately detect cues that reflect posters’ levels of 
narcissism and psychopathy, although Machiavellianism is more difficult for 
people to detect.217
Research also suggests that personality predicts online engagement. 
Organizations who are struggling with getting customers or employees to inter￾act with their content have found that people differ in the extent to which they 
enjoy interacting and sharing with others. For instance, MovieLens, an online 
movie recommendation community, found it was able to encourage more 
engagement from the community by enabling users to create and share Top 
Five movie lists with other users.218
The Personal and Relational Outcomes of Social Media Perhaps the biggest 
impact of social media has been on how people form relationships and con￾nect with others. Some have speculated that social media use has led to some 
fairly drastic changes. For instance, the shallowing hypothesis suggests that 
social media usage has led to less reflective and more rapid thought that 
can result in shallow evaluations or judgments.219 Others have examined 
its impact on explicit personal and relational outcomes, which have major 
implications for OB, especially when they directly concern or spill over to 
affect work.
First, social media can be a double-edged sword for people. It can be a 
good thing for employees’ happiness and well-being when it enables them 
to make meaningful connections but a bad thing when it leads to compar￾ing themselves with other people or makes them feel alienated.220 Moreover, 
social media can be used as an effective tool to reduce loneliness when peo￾ple use it to forge new social connections and enhance existing relationships 
(but not when it is used for escapism or when it supplants deeper in-person 
engagement).221
Second, research has demonstrated that social media can lead employ￾ees to engage in constructive dialogue with managers and coworkers, but 
only when they feel they have a sense of autonomy in what they can say 
online (e.g., a psychologically safe online space) and identify with their 
organization.222 Furthermore, social media can lead employees to develop 
and build relationships with others who can help them in their careers, a 
benefit particularly enjoyed by those with extroverted personality traits.223
However, the relational benefits of social media can be completely 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 382 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 383
undermined if employees become caught up in competition and social com￾parison. Hundreds of studies have demonstrated that social media use can 
negatively impact people’s self-worth and self-esteem. 224 As some researchers 
put it: On social media, “every day is a high school reunion.” 225 
 Finally, in the team context, social media can help develop shared cognition 
among members by enabling members to manage and expand their teams’ net￾work, by integrating content they can use to better perform their jobs, and by 
making thoughts and decisions more accessible for use in later team taskwork 
(e.g., recorded discussions on a Facebook group news feed). 226 Social media 
can also facilitate the sharing of knowledge among team members as it can lead 
employees to develop a collective sense of trust and curiosity. However, team 
members are usually attracted to interacting on social media so they can engage 
with nonwork content. As such, they might not be sharing knowledge in the way 
that organizations would hope. 227
 An Ethical Choice 
 What Should You Do If an Employee Is Being 
Cyberbullied or Harassed Online? 
U.S. law requires organizations 
to ensure that workplaces are 
free from discrimination and 
harassment. However, the fact that 
more and more employees are working 
remotely complicates the situation. If 
you are an employer, chances are that 
at least one of your employees has 
been affected by some form of online 
abuse. For instance, over 44 percent of 
Americans report having experienced 
online harassment. While anyone can 
be a victim of online harassment, peo￾ple are often more likely to be targeted 
for their sexual orientation, gender 
identity, race, ethnicity, and religion and 
may face even more severe types of 
harassment. Even though more orga￾nizations are announcing their commit￾ment to diverse, inclusive, and equita￾ble work environments, action needs to 
be taken because the consequences 
of online abuse are significant. For 
example, a 2017 PEN America survey 
of writers and journalists found that 
over a third of respondents had expe￾rienced online harassment, reporting 
that it had impacted their professional 
lives. 
 How can employers take concrete 
actions to prepare for, respond to, and 
reduce the negative impact of online 
abuse? 
1. Organizations must recognize the 
harm that online harassment can 
cause. Creating an environment in 
which employees feel comfortable, 
supported, and protected when re￾porting online abuse is essential. 
Many individuals who experience 
online harassment may have also 
been marginalized in other situa￾tions. As such, they may feel uneasy 
about potentially being dismissed, 
mocked, or even reprimanded. 
2. Survey employees to determine the 
extent to which they face online ha￾rassment and how they are handling 
it. The survey should investigate 
how often employees are facing 
abuse and on what platforms. Also 
important is assessing the emo￾tional, psychological, and profes￾sional impact of the harassment. 
3. Develop protocols and training. 
These can help ensure that employ￾ees know the concrete steps they 
can take to protect themselves in 
case of online abuse. 
4. Promote peer support networks. 
Online abuse can potentially lead 
those who experience it to feel iso￾lated and alone. Peer support net￾works can give employees a space 
to find community, share experi￾ences, and exchange strategies. 
5. Managers can play a crucial role by 
reaching out and listening to employ￾ees. Due to their identities or life 
experiences, some employees may 
not feel comfortable sharing their 
situations publicly, so being discreet 
might be best. 228
The Organizational Outcomes of Social Media Since the dawn of social media 
decades ago, organizations have been concerned with the “public” nature of 
social media and the potential for damage to their reputations. 229 Indeed, it 
is difficult for management to control the content that employees post; even 
 well-intentioned executives, managers, and employees post comments that 
could be construed as harmful to their organization’s reputation or that reveal 
confidential or sensitive information. 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 383 21/12/22 6:49 AM384 PART 3 The Group
For instance, Indra Nooyi (the former CEO of PepsiCo) described in a 2018 
interview how the company was exploring gender-specific advertising for Doritos, 
making a number of stereotyping and insensitive comments to that end. Following 
this gaffe, “lady Doritos” became a trending topic on social media, and the whole 
situation turned into a heated fiasco that was very damaging to the company’s 
reputation.230 As an additional example, the New York Daily News, shortly after 
being acquired by Tronc, made the decision to downsize the company by half—a 
decision that resulted in the termination of the entire social media team. After 
hearing the news, the social media team peppered the New York Daily News’ Twitter 
account with disgruntled gifs and memes to voice their ire with the decision.231
Many may downplay public image crises like these, but they do matter. One study 
found that both corporate and customer messaging on Twitter predicted stock 
analyst recommendations in S&P 500 companies. The message here is that social 
media messages have real financial implications for organizations.232
However, the concern with organizational reputation highlights a tension 
between employers and employees: employees who assert their right to authenti￾cally speak out about their experiences and perceptions at work, and organiza￾tions who endeavor to protect their reputation and brand.233 This tension has led 
to a push and pull between granting and exercising autonomy versus control and 
regulation.234 However, the climate surrounding social media has changed the 
business context so much that the way organizations manage their reputations 
has been completely transformed.235 In the previous climate, news media outlets 
obtained and broadcasted information about organizations, which then led to 
the development of reputation. Organizations in many ways had a hand in this 
process by developing relationships with media outlets, threatening lawsuits or 
withdrawal of funding if the media outlet broadcasts damaging information, and 
developing their own communication and branding through advertising. Social 
media, on the other hand, put content distribution in the hands of people. Now, 
millions of people can post content, both factual and fake, about organizations 
that resounds and diffuses when shared throughout their networks—a process 
that can make or break an organization’s reputation. The threat of legal action 
and attempts to control this process become extremely difficult at this scale. This 
has led many organizations to develop restrictive social media policies that limit 
employees’ freedoms to share information, speak freely, and engage in dialogue 
with stakeholders.236
Cybersecurity
Security is a huge concern for nearly all organizations with private or propri￾etary information about clients, customers, and employees.237 Organizations 
worry about the security of electronic information they seek to protect such 
as digital hospital patient data, physical information they still keep in records 
warehouses, and information they entrust their employees with knowing.238 In 
general, cybersecurity threats can come from a variety of sources, all with vari￾ous motivations: organized attackers (e.g., terrorists and spies), employees (e.g., 
disgruntled or opportunistic employees and even leaders), professional hack￾ers or criminals, and even amateurs (e.g., malicious or curious outsiders who 
delight in the thrill of hacking).239 As employees are the only group in this 
list companies have direct contact with, management may monitor employee 
online activity and communications, which can seem invasive to employees.
But employees are also concerned with their privacy—as a number of organi￾zations get caught up in massive data breaches in which their personal informa￾tion is stolen.240 For instance, employee data from Seattle-based Nordstrom was 
breached and leaked via a third-party contractor.241 This information included 
names, banking information, social security numbers, salary information, 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 384 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 385
and more. Tim Erlin, vice president of Product Management and Strategy at 
Tripwire, notes: “While we tend to see more headlines about customer data, 
compromises of employee data are also significant, especially to large employ￾ers who have thousands of employees. Think about the personal data that your 
employer has about you. There’s enough data in there to carry out a variety of 
criminal activities, including identity theft and insurance fraud.”242 Employees 
are worried that social media networks do little to appropriately safeguard their 
information.243 This has led employees to take safeguarding their privacy into 
their own hands by sharing less and keeping their personal information closer 
than before or by remaining vigilant over what they do share.244
What can employers do to mitigate the threat of data breaches and intellec￾tual property loss? Experts say that it is important to (1) understand the threats 
in order to mitigate them, (2) build a culture that values cybersecurity, and (3) 
adapt to ever-changing cybersecurity threats.245
Cross-Cultural Communication
There is a West African saying that suggests strangers see only what they know.246
As diverse and multicultural people of the world, we all enter interactions and 
relationships with other people carrying our own set of assumptions, histories, 
experiences, traditions, practices, and languages. Aligned with cultural mosaic 
theory (see the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations), we 
are all like mosaics composed of many different tiles. However, when we interact 
with one another, in many ways we are strangers with an imperfect understand￾ing of other people and the tiles that make them unique.
Effective communication is difficult under the best of conditions. Effective 
cross-cultural communication is no different and experiences its own unique 
challenges stemming from the values, traditions, and beliefs that differ across 
people. As an example, a gesture that is well understood and acceptable in one 
culture can be meaningless or lewd in another. An approach that is the default 
way of solving a problem in one culture may need to be avoided at all costs in 
another. Some emotions, such as feeling misunderstood, may not be as distress￾ing in some cultures as they may be in others.247
A manager at L’Oréal once said, “We believe the more we debate openly and the 
more strongly we disagree in meetings, the closer we get to excellence, the more we 
generate creativity, and the more we reduce risk.” But would L’Oréal employees 
from different backgrounds and cultures agree with this statement? Upon hear￾ing this statement, an Indonesian L’Oréal employee noted that “to an Indonesian 
person, confrontation in a group setting is extremely negative, because it makes the 
other person lose face. So it’s something that we try strongly to avoid in any open 
manner.” Furthermore, a Mexican L’Oréal employee suggested “in Mexican cul￾ture, open disagreement is considered rude, disrespectful, and too aggressive.”248
In this section, we discuss the ways in which culture affects communication 
along with how people in organizations communicate cross-culturally. First, we 
discuss the meaning and influence of cultural context. Second, we discuss the 
interface between cultures and how to navigate it. Third, we discuss the aspects 
of culture that affect communication. Finally, we provide an evidence-based 
guide toward effective cross-cultural communication.
Cultural Context
In the chapter on diversity, we described some of the many ways in which 
cultures differ by values and in norms. Cultures also tend to differ in the 
degree to which context influences the meaning individuals take from

in effective cross-cultural 
communication in 
organizations.
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 385 21/12/22 6:49 AM386 PART 3 The Group
communication.249 In high-context cultures such as Japan, Kenya, Saudi 
Arabia, and India, people rely heavily on nonverbal and subtle cues in com￾municating with others, and a person’s official status, place in society, and 
reputation carry considerable weight. What is not said may be more significant 
than what is said. In contrast, people from low-context cultures such as the 
United States, Australia, Germany, and Denmark rely essentially on spoken 
and written words to convey meaning; body language and formal titles are 
secondary (see Exhibit 11-5).
Contextual differences mean quite a lot in terms of communication.250
Communication in high-context cultures implies considerably more trust by 
both parties. What may appear to be casual and insignificant conversation in 
fact reflects the desire to build a relationship and create trust. Oral agreements 
imply strong commitments in high-context cultures. And who you are—your 
age, experience, and rank in the organization—is highly valued and heavily 
influences your credibility. But in low-context cultures, enforceable contracts 
tend to be in writing, precisely worded, and highly legal. Similarly, low-context 
cultures value directness. Managers are expected to be explicit and precise in 
conveying what they mean.
Some research suggests that high-context cultural approaches may result in 
better negotiation outcomes—because they direct attention toward the subtle 
and unspoken cues that might be valuable information during a negotiation.251
What about when individuals from high-context and low-context cultures 
collaborate in virtual teams? As we described earlier, less “media-rich” channels 
(e.g., e-mail, text messages) may be more detrimental to those from high-context 
cultures, who rely heavily on subtle context cues, such as nonverbal behavior.252
From a multicultural perspective, individuals with both backgrounds may be 
“ambidextrous” in their communication, and able to switch between modes or 
adapt the channels they use when communicating with others from high- or 
low-context cultures.253
As a final note, attention to cues and context are not the only contex￾tual feature that matters in cross-cultural communication: The situation also 
matters. Indeed, there are physical (e.g., opportunities for personal contact), 
affective (e.g., heightened risk or insecurity), and cognitive (e.g., ambiguity 
or uncertainty) aspects of situations that make culture aspects more or less 
salient.254 When situations become extreme, cross-cultural communication 
is likely to become much more heated. For instance, professional transla￾tors have a very difficult job. One study in the Armed Forces Journal reported 
that interpreters deployed in Iraq were ten times more likely to die in com￾bat than other soldier functions.255 Furthermore, other OB theorists suggest 
that different cultural differences matter more or less in certain situations.256
In typical communication contexts (e.g., involving routine interpretation or 
behavior), an understanding of norms, “the way things are done,” and shared 
understandings for what is appropriate matter the most. However, in ethical or 
morally charged situations, cultural values (see the chapter on diversity, equity, 
and inclusion in organizations) begin to matter more than norms for routine 
behavior. This explains why people sometimes “act against” their cultural pro￾clivities, like an American (from an individualistic culture) politician acting 
in collectivist ways to raise funds for their campaign.257 Lastly, some situations 
may be more or less attributable to cultural values. These values-shaped situa￾tions can then determine who feels free to speak up and share their thoughts 
in a team setting. For example, psychological safety may be a function of a 
culture’s masculine or feminine values (see the chapter on diversity, equity, 
and inclusion in organizations), empowering capable employees to speak up 
in masculine cultures and communicating that lower-capability employees are 
valued and should feel safe to speak up in feminine cultures.258

The Interface Between Cultures
When people find themselves in a cross-cultural communication situation, they are 
not at the mercy of the situation and do not behave in some predetermined way. 
There are complex dynamics surrounding the interaction that involve not only the 
context and situation but also (1) an understanding of one’s own cultural approach 
and (2) an understanding of the interaction partner’s cultural approach. To bet￾ter understand these sometimes-opposing, sometimes-complementary forces, 
we depict a framework introduced by cross-cultural OB theorists in Exhibit 11-6. 
Essentially, in a cross-cultural interaction section, there is a trade-off between five 
approaches that all vary as a function of one’s own and others’ cultural approaches. Of 
course, it is important to assert that Exhibit 11-6 applies to both interaction partners 
in the communication episode.259 Try not to think of the interaction as what can be 
done to manage “the other person” but rather how both interaction partners can 
come to an agreement on the cultural approach given the situation.
• Avoiding (Low-Own/Low-Other): Putting aside cultural preferences, val￾ues, practices, or customs, often for tactical or strategic reasons.
• Imposing (High-Own/Low-Other): Asserting one’s own cultural preferences, val￾ues, practices, and customs without acknowledging others’ cultural approaches.
• Embracing (Low-Own/High-Other): Putting aside one’s own cultural 
preferences, values, practices, and customs in order to acknowledge or 
embrace others’ cultural approaches.
• Synergizing (High-Own/High-Other): Celebrating both interaction 
partners’ cultural preferences, values, practices, and customs, often in an 
improvisational or flexible way.
• Compromising (Mid-Own/Mid-Other): Treating the cultural interaction 
as a give-and-take; recognizing when cultural preferences, values, prac￾tices, and customs conflict and embracing some and putting aside others 
in order to reduce conflict.

Beyond these two dimensions, there is a third dimension that is just as impor￾tant as the other two.260 In a cross-cultural interaction in a business context, 
some situations are more extreme than others. As we mentioned earlier, the 
extremity and moral aspects of the situation often strongly enhance or greatly 
curtail cultural expressions in interaction. As such, there is also a strategic ele￾ment to communication that matters. If the consequences for cultural expres￾sion or speaking out against violators of one’s cultural values or norms become 
great, people may strategically abstain from expression or ignore violations.
Aspects of Cultural Communication
In cross-cultural communication, there are several aspects of others’ cultures that can 
lead to differences in perspectives, perceptions, and attributions261 (even though many 
aspects of communication tend to be fairly consistent across cultures, such as emotional 
displays and body language).262 Many of these involve language.263 For instance, semantics
may lead to differences in interpretation of language. Words mean different things to dif￾ferent people, particularly people from different cultures. For example, “pena ajena” in 
Spanish and “fremdschämen” in German mean “to be embarrassed for someone” but 
are essentially untranslatable into English (although English speakers on the Internet may 
have started using “cringe” to describe this situation).264 Or sometimes, you might feel 
afraid to ask someone else for help at work because you do not want to be a bother, hurt 
their feelings, or show that you cannot handle a situation on your own—the Thai lan￾guage has a word for this: “greng-jai.” Some of these aspects of cultural communication go 
well beyond language. For instance, studies suggest that some cultures (e.g., Japan) have 
extremely unique vocalizations and accents that convey specific emotions that are virtually 
uninterpretable to people from different cultures unfamiliar with them.265
Second, word connotations matter in cross-cultural communication because 
the same word can imply different things in different languages. Negotiations 
between U.S. and Japanese executives can be difficult because the Japanese word 
hai translates as “yes,” but its connotation is “Yes, I’m listening” rather than “Yes, 
I agree.” Although research suggests that the negative perceptions of someone 
making an error in word usage or connotation are diminished when one finds 
out they are from a different culture, this is not the case for etiquette violations. 
As such, misinterpretations from wording and language might be much less 
impactful than those involving norms and etiquette.266 What might an etiquette 
mishap look like? For one, it could be the use of a taboo word, which can be dis￾tracting and offensive to the person for whom the word is culturally taboo.267
Third, tone differences can lead to emotional misconceptions during 
cross-cultural interactions. In some cultures, language is formal; in others, it is 
informal. The tone might change depending on the context: People may speak 
differently at home and in social situations than at work. Using a personal, infor￾mal style when a more formal style is expected might be seen as inappropri￾ate. For example, Mexican employees are relatively formal in their dress and 
communication in the tire industry, compared with other countries—they also 
tend to use the formal version of you (usted) in the workplace rather than the 
informal version (tú).268 As another example, studies of e-mail communica￾tion between Chinese and U.S. employees of a multinational firm found that 
Chinese employees preferred to engage in “facework” (i.e., phrases or questions 
meant to show they cared about the e-mail recipient, like “I hope all is well) 
and tended to leave their request to the end of the e-mail, behaviors that U.S. 
employees tended to dislike.269 Or some cultures may require a tonally differ￾ent set of actions than others to express certain emotions. For example, in one 
study, American participants perceived and expressed gratitude through touch 
and contact (e.g., hugs, handshakes), whereas Taiwanese participants expressed 
gratitude through self-improvement (e.g., living up to their social roles and 
cultivating personal skills).270 Moreover, a separate study showed that verbal 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 388 21/12/22 6:49 AMCommunication CHAPTER 11 389
expressions of gratitude might be seen as emotionally negative and uncomfort￾able by Chinese participants (when compared with Canadian participants).271
Fourth, cultures may differ in tolerance for conflict and methods for resolving con￾flicts. People from individualist cultures tend to be more comfortable with direct 
conflict and will make the source of their disagreements overt. People from 
collectivist cultures are more likely to acknowledge conflict only implicitly and 
avoid emotionally charged disputes. They may attribute conflicts to the situation 
more than to the individuals and therefore may not require explicit apologies 
to repair relationships, whereas individualists prefer explicit statements accept￾ing responsibility for conflicts and public apologies to restore relationships.
Fifth, cultures may differ in the types of information they communicate to others. 
For instance, one study comparing Japanese and American storytelling showed 
that the Japanese participants in this study were more likely to use collectivist 
language and refer to collectivist values in their storytelling than Americans 
(who tended to focus on individualistic language and information).272 Another 
study comparing Korean and American Facebook users showed that Koreans 
viewed social media in a more collectivist, relational fashion than Americans 
and were more likely to engage in relationship-sustaining activities on the 
social network.273 Lastly, another study of Spanish-speaking Latinx people 
found a clear preference for communicating with metaphor and analogy, 
which they found more convincing in arguments, and they liked people who 
used metaphor and analogy better than those who abstained from that type of 
language.274
In addition, while all cultures identify certain words and behaviors as overly 
aggressive, there are certain types of behaviors that are more likely to be identified as 
negative depending on the culture. In Israel, Pakistan, and Japan, there is a greater 
distinction between verbal and physical aggression. In the United States and Israel, 
behaviors that infringe on personal resources are considered aggressive, while 
Pakistan differentiates between different degrees of threats. Different standards for 
aggression reflect the ways that a person may interpret or respond to a conflict.275
A Guide to Cross-Cultural Communication
There is much to be gained from business intercultural communications. It is safe 
to assume that every one of us has a different viewpoint that is culturally shaped. 
Because we do have differences, we have an opportunity to reach the most creative 
solutions possible with the help of others if we communicate effectively.
According to Fred Casmir, a leading expert in intercultural communication 
research, we often do not communicate well with people outside our culture 
Communication barriers exist be￾tween these call center employees in 
Manila, the Philippines, and their U.S. 
and Canadian customers even though 
they all communicate in English. 
Training helps these employees 
convey messages effectively to their 
customers.

M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 389 21/12/22 6:49 AM390 PART 3 The Group
because we tend to generalize from only their cultural origin (e.g., through ste￾reotyping; see the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations). For 
instance, one study of Jamaican-Indian software teams found that these virtual team 
members engaged in a process called culturizing, where they negatively stereotyped 
the culturally different team members and reinforced the boundaries between the 
groups.276 This can be culturally insensitive and potentially disastrous, especially 
when we make assumptions based on observable characteristics. Many of us have a 
richly varied ethnic background and would be offended if someone addressed us 
based on stereotypical information or generalizations.
Casmir noted that, because there are far too many cultures for anyone to under￾stand completely and individuals interpret their own cultures differently, intercultural 
communication should be based on sensitivity and pursuit of common goals. He 
found the ideal condition is an ad hoc “third culture” that a group can form when 
its members seek to incorporate aspects of each member’s cultural communication 
preferences. The norms that this subculture establishes through appreciating individ￾ual differences create a common ground for effective communication. Intercultural 
groups that communicate effectively can be highly productive and innovative.
When communicating with people from a different culture, what can you do to 
reduce misinterpretations? Casmir and other experts offer the following suggestions:
Prior to Interaction
1. Know yourself. Recognizing your own cultural identity and biases is critical 
to understanding the unique viewpoints of other people.
2. Foster a climate of mutual respect, fairness, and democracy. Clearly es￾tablish an environment of equality and mutual concern. This will be your 
“third culture” context for effective intercultural communication that 
transcends each person’s cultural norms. Ask yourself how you will remain 
open-minded and maintain a willingness to modify any stereotypes about 
the other members and their cultures.
During the Interaction
3. Consider the other person’s viewpoint. Before saying anything, try to 
take the others’ perspectives. Is what I am about to say potentially insensi￾tive? Does it make assumptions about their background? If I am unclear 
about something, is it appropriate to just ask? Try to take a collaborative 
problem-solving approach whenever potential conflicts arise.
4. Learn from misunderstandings. Acknowledge when a misunderstanding 
has occurred, and if it was based on a stereotype or generalized assump￾tion, try to correct this assumption. Try to leave the misunderstanding 
behind collectively from a position of mutual learning and in a way that 
strengthens the relationship and unites you toward your common goal.
After the Interaction
5. Proactively maintain the identity and culture of the group. Like any culture, 
the establishment of a common-ground “third culture” for effective inter￾cultural communication takes time and nurturing. Reinforce the group’s 
common goals, mutual respect, and need to adapt to individual commu￾nication preferences. After any interaction, consider how the new insights 
from the group can become a part of the group’s permanent cognitive and 
behavioral understanding.
6. Learn from all intercultural interactions. After any intercultural interac￾tion (not just this one), try to consider how you can take what you have 
learned from the situation and apply it to other situations you find yourself 
in to build your cultural intelligence (CQ) over time.277

Summary
In many ways, communication between people is one of the primary ways 
people behave in organizations, making it an essential component of OB. 
Communication plays a significant role in responding to crises, sharing and 
exchanging information with one another, and approaching ethical situations. 
From conversations and discussions, to written exchanges via e-mail and tex￾ting, to interpreting the subtle cues body language conveys, there are myriad 
ways we interact with one another. Although sometimes we are unaware of or 
lack control over how we communicate with others, employees and managers 
in organizations should try to manage their communication approaches and 
media to best suit the messages they are trying to convey and address any bar￾riers to effective communication. Moreover, technological advances have high￾lighted the many ways in which we communicate with one another through 
time and space. For instance, videoconferencing, blogging, vlogging, podcast￾ing, e-collaboration, and e-learning are common ways people communicate 
with one another virtually. In many ways, these virtual communication media 
are unique in that they are extremely rich and can get close to approximating 
in-person communication. They have evolved to develop their own language of 
sorts (through emojis, selfies, usernames, etc.). This increased media richness is 
made possible through technology. Smartphones, social media apps, and audio￾visual equipment have enhanced access to these communication forms for many 
people. However, these advancements foretell an impending cybersecurity crisis 
that organizations are still trying to figure out how to manage. Finally, diversity 
and cross-cultural differences have significant implications for communication. 
The context and the content of communication matter for reconciling cultural 
differences, impacting OB outcomes like negotiation performance and conflict.
Implications for Managers
● Consider issues of (a)synchronicity when deciding how to communicate 
any messages. Does the message require everyone to be psychologically 
and physically present?
● Practice active and reflective listening to communicate more effectively 
and build stronger, trusting work relationships.
● Be aware of your message, language, and nonverbal communication—
they can make or break an effective speech.
● Follow best practices and norms when communicating electronically 
to reduce stress and overload as well as to save time for you and your 
coworkers.
● Although we often do not have control over some of our more automatic, 
subtle nonverbal communication, we should be aware of how it influences 
the messages we are trying to convey.
● Reduce information overload by leveraging technology, develop personal 
and team awareness of information demands, and reduce the ambiguity 
and complexity of messages.
● If you are experiencing communication apprehension, develop emo￾tion regulation techniques that enable you to cope with the increased 
apprehension.
● In crises, work together and use technology to make sense of the situation 
and to develop solutions to the problems the crisis produces.
● Mindfully use smartphones and social media to meet your personal and 
professional objectives. However, always be aware of the effect they may be 
M11_ROBB0025_19_GE_C11.indd 391 21/12/22 6:49 AM392 PART 3 The Group
having on you. Take action when you recognize that their use is depleting 
or interfering with your well-being or health. 
● Try not to see cross-cultural communication as you managing someone 
else’s culture. Instead, view cross-cultural communication as something 
collaborative and reconciled through interaction, mutual understanding, 
and mutual learning. 
 Work Friendships Are Not a Good Idea 
POINT 
A n ethical rule in psychotherapy, the dual relationship principle, 
 helps explain why work friendships can go wrong. A therapist 
 cannot be friends with a patient because every relationship 
has goals. When you have more than one relationship, goals can con￾flict and cause therapist-patient relationship issues. Although this rule 
does not directly apply to the workplace, friendships with colleagues 
can create a similar tension when there are conflicting goals. 
 For example, consider a situation in which someone is promoted 
to a management role and another person who was once their peer 
is now their direct report. A friendship between them can seriously 
complicate the interpersonal dynamics of this changed relationship. A 
manager must evaluate and sometimes critique the work performance 
of their direct reports. These tasks can be hard to do for a friend, strain 
the relationship between the two, and quickly pose a challenge to the 
team’s or organization’s operations. 
 While some individuals may effortlessly form friendships with their 
colleagues at work, there is also the risk that employees will feel left 
out when informal cliques form. In turn, ostracized individuals may 
form their own subgroups, isolating employees from one another even 
further and ultimately reducing communication between groups. 
 On the other hand, the closer the friendship, the more likely it will 
interfere with one’s work performance. For example, intrusions (e.g., a 
friend sharing personal and work problems) may have adverse effects 
on one’s ability to focus on their taskwork and goals. These disclo￾sures are not only time-consuming, but they are also more emotion￾ally engaging, less likely to be related to work tasks, and frequently 
emotionally depleting. 
 All of this is not to say that you still cannot be cordial and pleasant 
to your coworkers. However, keeping these relationships professional 
is ultimately in your best interests and those of the organization. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 G
 iven that you likely spend between a third and a half of the 
 hours you are awake each week at work, your relationships with 
 people at work can be some of the most significant relation￾ships in your life. Furthermore, having good relationships with your 
coworkers is one of the strongest predictors of your happiness at 
work. Informal social relationships also offer benefits like emotional 
support, cultivating positive identity development, and socialization. 
 If there are any costs to workplace friendships, the benefits prob￾ably greatly outweigh these costs. For example, the positive affect 
experienced as a result of forming workplace friendships can likely 
prevent exhaustion at work. This effect has the potential to result in 
at least partial improvements in job performance. Thus, while certain 
aspects of workplace friendships (e.g., emotional support) may seem 
distracting to work, relationships with coworkers may ultimately im￾prove work performance. Communicating with colleagues helps de￾crease the salience of emotional distractions and allows employees to 
better focus on work tasks. 
 The key is to create boundaries between coworkers by either 
avoiding work-related topics outside the office or agreeing on the top￾ics to avoid in social situations with coworkers. Workplace friendships 
do not have to create conflicts of interest. Instead, they can be quite 
rewarding as long as they are navigated appropriately. Lastly, belong￾ing is a fundamental human need. Given that we spend eight to nine 
hours every day at work, we often have much less time to meet our 
social needs outside work. As a result, the workplace can be an ideal 
place to form positive connections with others and benefit our overall 
well-being, health, and productivity. 278

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
The ability to communicate with others effectively is vital 
to succeeding in the workplace. Communication allows 
us to lead groups and teams effectively, provide and 
receive feedback, share emotions, inspire and persuade 
others, and exchange information. A strong understand￾ing of how to communicate effectively with others can 
help you be a better manager or employee by allowing 
you to share information, coordinate with your team, and 
reduce misunderstandings. In this chapter, you learned 
critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and leadership 
skills by discovering the power of listening for building 
working relationships, considering what to do if a subor￾dinate or coworker is cyberbullied, considering the role 
public and private organizations should play in provid￾ing Internet access, and debating whether work friend￾ships are a good idea. In the next part of the chapter, 
you will build your communication and self-management 
skills by role-playing a communication incident between 
a supervisor and subordinate at a café, considering the 
ethics of “bring-your-own-device” workplace policies, 
and discovering how to convey passion during employ￾ment interviews.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Choosing the Right Modes of Communication
Pair up with someone you have never worked with before. 
In this exercise, you will pretend to be Gerard, the head 
of the accounting department in the company. During an 
intense week, you receive the following e-mail from the 
human resources director.
Subject: A difficult situation with an employee
Dear Gerard,
I am writing to inform you about a difficult situation 
we are handing among the personnel. An employee 
from the marketing department is experiencing inter￾personal tensions with the boss and two colleagues, due 
to which he is frequently absent from work. As he is a 
valued employee with good performance records in the 
past, we have decided that changing offices could be 
beneficial for him and the company.
We believe that your department would be a good 
environment for this employee to feel more engaged 
on the job. Two colleagues from HR will assist you and 
the employee in the transition process, which we hope 
to begin next month. All the people involved so far 
have demonstrated great collaboration with us, and we 
are sure you will do the same. Sorry for the short notice, 
but we are facing strict deadlines this month.
Do not hesitate to contact me if you have further 
questions. We will be monitoring the situation with 
monthly check-ins. I would like to thank you in advance 
for the welcome you will be giving the employee. 
Thanks,
Michel L. Dalton 
HR Director
You are both surprised by and disappointed in this e-mail 
for several reasons, including the decision to communicate 
such an important information via e-mail, the short notice 
period, and above all, the fact that you were not consulted 
in the decision before. However, you also know that help￾ing the organization to retain its talents is the right thing 
to do. Take five minutes and, individually, write draft re￾plies to Michel telling him whether you will welcome the 
employee. Then try to find an agreement together about 
the definitive reply to send the HR director, and discuss 
the following questions.

Questions
11-6. Were the both of you in agreement about the 
reply to send the HR director?
11-7. What alternative modes of communication would 
you have used in similar circumstances? Why?
11-8. Discuss with your partner the possible impact on 
Gerard’s reputation and career if he accepts or 
denies the HR director’s request. What changes 
in HR practices could avoid this situation in the 
future?
ETHICAL DILEMMA BYOD
“What’s your cell phone number? Good, I’ll call you about 
the meeting.” If you are like many people in the world who 
have used a smartphone for years or one of the 1.4 billion 
people who bought one recently, chances are you have 
used it for work. In fact, your employer may have even 
invited—or asked—you to use your smartphone, tablet, 
or laptop in your job. Such is the bring-your-own-device 
(BYOD) trend, which started out of friendly convenience 
but now carries major ethical issues. For instance:
• Did you know your employer can wipe your personal devices 
clean? Remotely? With no warning? It happens, espe￾cially considering that 31 percent of organizations 
require employees to BYOD to work and 61 percent of 
organizations expect their employees to be available 
remotely, without giving company-owned devices. Any￾time an organization has a privacy concern, it may wipe 
all devices clean to prevent a further breach of its cyber 
defenses, as long as the employee has consented to a 
“mobile device management” agreement. For instance, 
Rivers (a former transgender Google employee) had 
her entire personal phone wiped almost completely 
to the point that it appeared like it was back at factory 
settings. This was especially painful for Rivers, who lost 
four months of her transition timeline photos that she 
will not be able to get back.
• Is your device part of your employment contract, either explic￾itly or by understanding? If so, who pays for the device? 
Well, you did, and you continue to pay for the service. 
If the device breaks, who pays for the replacement 
device? Can you lose your job if you cannot afford the 
device and service?
• Can you use your device for all work-related communications? 
The cloud has brought opportunities for people to 
send classified work information anywhere, anytime. 
Organizations are concerned about what social media, 
collaboration, and file-sharing applications are in use, 
which is fair, but some policies can limit how you use 
your own device.
• Once you use your personal device for work, where are the 
boundaries between work and home life? Research indicates 
that intensive smartphone users, for instance, need 
to disengage in their off-hours to prevent work–home 
stress and burnout. Yet not everyone can do this, even 
if they are allowed to; research indicates that a signifi￾cant proportion of smartphone users felt pressured to 
access their devices around the clock, whether or not 
that pressure was warranted.
The clear dilemma for employees is whether to ac￾knowledge you own a smart device, and whether to offer 
its use for your employer’s convenience. Put that way, it 
seems obvious to say no: Why would you risk possibly los￾ing everything to a corporate swipe? But the convenience 
of carrying one phone is real. Some people think it is bet￾ter to carry two phones—one for work, another for per￾sonal use. Attorney Luke Cocalis tried it and concluded, 
“It frankly keeps me saner.”
Questions
11-9. Do you use your smartphone or other personal 
devices for work? If so, do you think this adds 
to your stress level or helps you by providing 
convenience?
11-10. Cocalis likes the two-phone lifestyle and says that 
his supervisor has his personal phone number 
only for emergencies. But assistant talent manager 
Chloe Ifshin reports that it does not work so well 
in practice. “I have friends who are clients and 
clients who are friends,” she says, so work contacts 
end up on her personal phone and friends call 
her work phone. How does this consideration 
affect your thinking about using your own device 
for both work and leisure?
11-11. Organizations are taking steps to protect them￾selves from what employees might be doing on 
their personal devices through allowing only ap￾proved computer programs and stricter policies, 
but no federal regulations protect employees from 
these restrictions. What ethical initiatives might 
organizations adopt to make this situation fair for 
everyone?279

CASE INCIDENT How Do You Communicate That You Are Passionate During 
an Interview?
Kennedy had an impressive résumé, highlighting many 
technical projects, developmental experiences in previous 
jobs, several student awards, and excellent school grades. 
However, after interviewing at a new high-tech startup 
focused on robotics and machine learning, Kennedy was 
not offered the position—leaving Kennedy with a great 
deal of disappointment.
Fortunately, though, Kennedy learned the reason 
behind the decision from a colleague who worked at 
the company who disagreed with the decision. Quite 
simply, the interviewers believed that Kennedy was not 
passionate enough. More specifically, they noted that 
Kennedy was quiet, did not provide specific informa￾tion about the unique contributions made to the proj￾ects listed on his résumé, and did not demonstrate 
the level of effusiveness they often saw in promising 
candidates.
After hearing this information, Kennedy immedi￾ately knew why there had been a disconnect. Growing 
up in Hong Kong, family members and teachers taught 
Kennedy to be very modest about accomplishments. But 
Kennedy was interviewing for a company in the United 
States, where there are different expectations and norms 
for a job search. Kennedy realized it was necessary to find 
some way to convey excitement and commitment in inter￾views without a complete personality change.
Kennedy thought that future job interviews might be 
an excellent opportunity to discuss hobbies and interests. 
Kennedy loved to develop computer programs and build 
robots on the weekends. During an upcoming interview 
at a similar company, Kennedy planned to show some of 
these robots’ videos to demonstrate enthusiasm and com￾mitment to the interviewers.
Questions
11-12. Do you believe Kennedy’s actions will effectively 
communicate passion and commitment during 
the upcoming interview? Why or why not? Would 
your answer be different if Kennedy’s hobbies 
had nothing to do with the job?
11-13. Do you agree with Kennedy’s decision to do 
something different? Why or why not? What 
other actions could Kennedy take to communi￾cate that he is passionate?
11-14. Do you agree that demonstrating passion is a 
good predictor of a great job candidate worthy 
of being considered during the hiring process? 
Why or why not? How important are passion and 
commitment compared with other predictors of 
a job candidates’ success (e.g., knowledge, skills, 
abilities, emotional intelligence, personality 
traits)?280

 THE TIME IS NOW 
As CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Rosalind Brewer is currently the only
 Black woman leading a Fortune 500 company—and only the third in 
modern history. Brewer has served as a compelling role model for aspiring 
leaders. She has spent over twenty years rising through the corporate ranks 
to be in the position she is in today. In fact, Brewer started as a research 
technician known for her strong analytical, operational, and strategic skills. 
At the same time, she is also well known for her servant leadership style, 
empowering teams to make decisions focusing on how to support their 
needs autonomously. 
 Throughout her career, Brewer has remained committed to furthering 
diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). She has played a crucial role in company￾wide transformations throughout her career. For example, when two Black 
men were sitting in a Starbucks waiting for their business partner in 2018, a 
barista called the police on them. A video of their arrest soon spread, leading 
to public outrage and protests. In response, Brewer (COO of Starbucks at 
the time) was quick to condemn the event publicly. She spoke about how it

impacted her personally as a Black woman with a son the same age as the 
arrested men. A month after the incident, Starbucks closed all U.S. stores to 
conduct racial-bias training for employees. The organization then implemented 
twelve additional training programs in the months that followed to cover topics 
such as empathy, inclusion, and team building. Brewer also led changes and 
refinements to Starbucks’s store policies concerning DEI goals.
As an outspoken advocate on racial and gender equity, Brewer’s 
transformations were not entirely smooth; she encountered much 
criticism and resistance along the way. For example, in a 2015 interview, 
she described a particularly contentious meeting she took part in as the 
CEO of Sam’s Club. In this meeting with a major supplier of Sam’s Club, 
all the other executives in attendance were White men. Brewer called this 
meeting to discuss their team’s lack of diversity with the supplier. Her 
recollection of the meeting in the interview was met with considerable 
public backlash, with some calling for a boycott of Sam’s Club stores. 
Brewer was merely trying to start a much-needed conversation about race. 
Many other executives, such as the president and CEO of Walmart, jumped 
to her defense: Brewer “was simply trying to reiterate that we believe 
diverse and inclusive teams make for a stronger business. That’s all there 
is to it and I support that important ideal.”
Despite the occasional criticism, Brewer continues to use her platform 
to draw attention to injustices or systemic oppressive structures. More 
specifically, Brewer believes a three-part strategy is needed to make 
organizations more diverse and inclusive. First, she cautions leaders from 
getting too caught up in the numbers game. Instead, leaders should spend 
time creating inclusive environments where people feel safe to be their 
authentic selves. Second, Brewer also suggests leaders should focus on 
building relationships, particularly with underrepresented employees and 
those from marginalized backgrounds. While at Starbucks, she frequently 
held breakfast sessions with employees, including baristas, to hear their 
stories and feedback. Lastly, investing in mentorship and sponsorship is 
critical. Brewer believes executives need to structure mentorship programs to 
allow all employees, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, 
to access senior leaders who can serve as mentors and sponsors. For 
Brewer, the time is now for organizations to apply these measures so that DEI 
can become less of a buzzword and more of a concrete leadership initiative.1
Leaders possess something that sets them apart from others. For instance,
Gloria Boyland (board member of UNFI, Vontier, and Chesapeake Energy) 
has been referred to as one of the most powerful women in corporate America. 
Boylan spends much of her time coaching and guiding executive leaders, 
inspiring them, and reaffirming their vital role to their organizations. As the 
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 398 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 399
former vice president of operations and service support at FedEx, she was 
well known for giving much autonomy to her followers: One of her guiding 
principles is, “Step back so others can step up.”2 She notes that she has learned 
a lot from FedEx founder and CEO Fred Smith, who leads by example as a 
transformational, motivational leader. As a Black woman, the cards have been 
stacked against her: Corporate leadership is dominated by White men, and 
women are compelled by leader stereotypes to be both warm and tough at the 
same time.3 Boyland exhibits many of the characteristics and behaviors of a 
leader while also highlighting some of the modern challenges facing leadership 
(e.g., a lack of ethnic and gender diversity).4
Surely, you have noticed, though, that not all leaders are managers, nor are 
all managers leaders. Nonsanctioned leadership—the ability to influence that arises 
outside the formal structure of the organization—is sometimes more important 
than formal influence. For example, Marcy Shinder (now chief marketing offi￾cer [CMO] at Work Market) builds relationships with coworkers at work and 
has informally emerged as a leader shortly after being hired.5 Although it has 
been defined in several ways and involves traits, behaviors, and other factors,6
we define leadership as the ability to influence a group toward the achievement 
of a vision or set of goals.7 Organizations need strong leadership and strong 
management for optimal effectiveness. We need leaders to challenge the status 
quo, create visions of the future, and inspire organizational members to achieve 
the visions. We need managers to formulate detailed plans, create efficient orga￾nizational structures, and oversee day-to-day operations.
Trait Theories
Strong leaders have been described by their traits throughout history. 
Therefore, leadership research has sought to identify the personality, social, 
physical, or intellectual attributes that differentiate leaders from nonleaders. 
These trait theories of leadership focus on personal qualities, including per￾sonality traits like those in the Big Five (see the chapter on personality and 
individual differences) and characteristics that predict two distinct outcomes: 
leadership emergence and leadership effectiveness.8 Keep in mind that just 
because someone exhibits the right traits and others consider that person a 
leader does not necessarily mean they will be effective or successful as a leader. 
Echoing the person-situation approach we discussed in the chapter on person￾ality and individual differences, leader behavior is a function of traits and the 
situation.9 In support, researchers and human resource (HR) practitioners 
have used machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to try 
to predict leader effectiveness from several leader characteristics and found 
that both traits and situational features are important predictors of leader 
effectiveness.10 One situational characteristic of interest is the power distance 
within a work group or team (see the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclu￾sion in organizations). Researchers have found that leader extroversion, for 
instance, is more effective in teams with higher power distance values because 
leaders can bridge the hierarchy between people and cause team members to 
coordinate, collaborate, and identify together as a team.11
Personality Traits and Leadership
What makes a person a leader? In general, individuals who like being around 
people and who can assert themselves (extroverted), who are disciplined and 
able to keep commitments they make (conscientious), and who are creative and 
flexible (open) have an apparent advantage when it comes to leadership.

12-1 Summarize the conclu￾sions of trait theories of 
leadership.
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 399 21/12/22 6:53 AM400 PART 3 The Group
Big Five Traits In examining the Big Five personality traits, researchers have 
consistently found extroversion to be important for several leadership outcomes. 
Despite being the strongest predictor of motivation to lead and leader emer￾gence,12 extroversion also predicts several leadership behaviors or styles. For 
example, extroverted leaders are more likely to use transformational leadership 
styles and consideration behaviors (as described later in this chapter).13 As such, 
they are likely to be considered more effective leaders, although it is the agentic, 
bold, or assertive aspects of extroversion that account for this—not necessarily 
the warm, sociable, affiliative aspects.14 For example, these agentic aspects are 
responsible for executive behaviors that can be construed as both “good” and 
“bad”—such as enacting socially responsible policies or instituting mass layoffs to 
conserve capital.15 They are also perhaps responsible for explaining why women 
often under-emerge as leaders: Women are stereotypically associated with the 
affiliative aspects of extroversion, which affects the extent to which they are per￾ceived as participating in leadership processes.16 So although extroversion can 
predict effective leadership, the relationship may be due to unique facets of the 
trait. As a caveat, however, being “too bold” or “too warm” can also hurt your chances 
of emerging as a leader.17
Although agreeableness and emotional stability are important to some 
aspects of leadership (e.g., they predict follower satisfaction with the leader), 
openness to experience appears to be less important as a trait despite being a 
modest predictor of leader effectiveness and follower voice behavior (see the 
following chapter on power and politics).18 Conscientiousness, on the other 
hand, appears to be important for several leadership behaviors and outcomes. 
For example, conscientiousness predicts initiating structure behaviors as well as
consideration behaviors (as described later in this chapter).19 Conscientiousness 
is also a moderate predictor of leader effectiveness and follower satisfaction20 as 
well as the strongest leader trait predictor of group performance.21
Proactive Personality Traits Leaders’ proactive personality also has an impor￾tant influence on leadership outcomes. In particular, it appears to matter dur￾ing specific times during a team, department, or organization’s life cycle.22 For 
instance, leader proactivity makes all the difference in leadership transitions, as 
leaders are more likely to foster followers’ identification with their new agenda, 
become more behaviorally engaged in their work, and engage in voice behavior. 
This is especially the case when the incoming leader was much more proactive 
than the previous leader (making the new leader appear better by compari￾son!).23 Proactive leaders also appear to be more effective in groups and teams 
in which the members have a high need for relational approval because they are 
able to craft supportive environments that fulfill this need. These team mem￾bers perform better and become more committed to their teams when they are 
led by proactive leaders.24
Dark Triad Traits What about the Dark Triad personality traits (see the chapter 
on personality and individual differences)? Research indicates they are not all 
bad for leadership: Normative (midrange) scores on the Dark Triad personality 
traits (even psychopathy) were optimal, suggesting that having too much (or 
too little) of the Dark Triad traits can result in ineffective leadership. However, 
this may be attributable to whether followers spend a lot of time with their lead￾ers. When followers work closely with their leaders, they have more opportu￾nity to observe exploitative or toxic behavior, which can diminish their trust 
in the leader and undermine their perceptions of leadership effectiveness.25
Furthermore, regardless of these traits’ impact on performance, the trait acti￾vation perspective (see the chapter on personality and individual differences) 
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 400 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 401
suggests that when these leaders feel that they are treated unfairly or are enti￾tled to better treatment, they will be more likely to act in self-interested, destruc￾tive ways that can be harmful to the organization.26
Thankfully, research indicates that building self-awareness and self-regulation 
skills may be helpful for leaders to control the effects of their Dark Triad traits.27
This self-awareness may be difficult for leaders to achieve, especially since narcis￾sists tend to engage in self-enhancement (e.g., perceive themselves more positively 
than others see them) and be selective in the feedback they elicit and listen to 
when it comes to leadership.28 Another way in which the toxic effects of dark traits 
can be mitigated is through consultation with followers. For instance, employees 
at a large Chinese IT company were not as fazed by their leaders’ narcissistic traits 
when those leaders sought out their feedback and considered it.29
Emotional Intelligence and Leadership
Another trait that may indicate effective leadership is emotional intelligence 
(EI). As discussed in the chapter on emotions and mood, a core component 
of EI is empathy. Empathetic leaders can sense others’ needs, listen to what 
followers say (and do not say), and read the reactions of others. A leader who 
effectively displays and manages emotions will find it easier to influence the 
feelings of followers by expressing emotions appropriate for the context, such 
as genuine sympathy and enthusiasm for good performance.30 Although the 
association between leaders’ self-reported EI and transformational leadership 
(to be discussed later in this chapter) is moderate, it is much weaker when fol￾lowers rate their leaders’ leadership behaviors.31 However, people high in EI are 
more likely to emerge as leaders, even after taking cognitive ability and person￾ality into account.32
Based on the latest findings, we offer two conclusions. First, traits can pre￾dict leadership. Second, traits do a better job predicting the emergence of lead￾ers than distinguishing between effective and ineffective leaders.33 As a final 
note regarding the future of personality and leadership, recent research and 
theory have “flipped” the relationship between the two. Just as it is possible 
for personality to predict leadership, some suggest that engaging in leadership

behaviors and taking on leadership roles can even change your personality, with 
leaders becoming more conscientious over time as they engage in leadership 
activities.34
Trait theories help us predict who emerges as leaders (and perhaps who will 
be effective leaders), but they do not fully explain leadership actions. What do 
successful leaders do that makes them effective? Are different types of leader 
behaviors equally effective? Behavioral theories, discussed next, help us define 
the parameters of leadership.
Behavioral Theories
Trait theories provide a basis for selecting the right people for leadership. 
Behavioral theories of leadership, in contrast, imply we can train people to be 
leaders.35
The most comprehensive behavioral theories of leadership resulted from 
the Ohio State Studies,36 which sought to identify independent dimensions of 
leader behavior. Beginning with more than a thousand dimensions, the studies 
narrowed the list to two that substantially accounted for most of the leadership 
behavior described by employees: initiating structure and consideration.
Initiating Structure
Initiating structure is the extent to which a leader defines and structures their 
role and those of their followers to facilitate goal attainment. It includes behav￾ior that attempts to organize work, work relationships, and goals. A leader who 
engages in initiating structure behaviors is someone who assigns followers tasks, 
sets definite standards of performance, and emphasizes deadlines. (You may now 
see why, as we mentioned earlier, conscientiousness would be an important per￾sonality trait to have here!) According to a review of hundreds of leadership 
studies, initiating structure is more strongly related to higher levels of group and 
organization productivity and to more positive performance evaluations.37
Consideration
Consideration is the extent to which a leader works to establish relationships 
characterized by mutual trust, respect for employees’ ideas, and regard for their 
feelings. A leader who engages in consideration helps employees with personal 
problems, behaves in a friendly and approachable manner, treats all employees 
as equals, and expresses appreciation and support (people-oriented). Most of 
us want to work for considerate leaders—according to one study by the National 
Bureau of Economic Research consisting of millions of responses over several 
years, working with a boss like this was “equivalent to the increased satisfac￾tion that comes from more than doubling your household income”!38 Indeed, 
research suggests that the followers of leaders high in consideration were more 
satisfied with their jobs, were more motivated and less stressed, and had more 
respect for their leaders.39
Initiating structure and consideration have several important practical impli￾cations for organizations. For instance, initiating structure and consideration 
behaviors have both been linked to whether employees who engage in those 
behaviors are selected into leadership succession planning programs and pipe￾lines.40 In other words, people who act like leaders have a higher likelihood of 
being considered for selection or succession into leadership positions.
Emotions and other factors also play roles in whether leaders engage 
in these behaviors. For example, leaders who are proud and self-confident

initiating structure The extent to which 
a leader defines and structures their role 
and those of their followers to facilitate goal 
attainment.
consideration The extent to which a leader 
has job relationships that are characterized 
by mutual trust, respect for subordinates’ 
ideas, and regard for their feelings.
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 402 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 403
(but not excessively or hubristically so) tend to engage in these leadership 
behaviors to a great extent. 41 The situation also plays a role. For instance, when 
faced with understaffing, leaders engage in initiating structure and consid￾eration to different degrees depending on the type of understaffing. 42 When 
understaffing is widespread, leaders will engage in initiating structure to ensure 
work processes and procedures are effective and efficient. When there is exper￾tise understaffing (e.g., limited talent in key roles in which turnover would be 
devastating), leaders engage in more consideration behaviors—showing their 
appreciation for key talent. Finally, with regard to cultural differences, research 
on thousands of managers in dozens of countries suggests that culture is much 
less important than the organization or managers themselves in determining 
whether they practice consideration or initiating structure behaviors. 43
 An Ethical Choice 
 The Ethics of Nudging 
A lthough management and leader￾ship often involve making direct
 requests or even commands of 
others, they can also rely on subtler, 
more indirect means. For instance, 
effective leadership can involve cre￾ating an environment in which others 
can make better decisions. One prom￾ising technique that can allow leaders 
to foster this type of environment is 
nudging. The crux of the nudging tech￾nique is to alter how decisions are 
made to divert (or nudge) them so that 
they lead to desirable outcomes. The 
most common type of nudge requires 
changing the default choice decision 
makers confront. 
 For example, a well-known nudge 
encourages organ donation in 
European countries by automatically 
enrolling citizens in the system. They 
can opt out if they prefer. By automati￾cally enrolling people in the program, 
citizens are “nudged” toward donating 
their organs upon passing. However, 
citizens are still given a choice and 
allowed to opt out if they do not want 
to donate their organs. The results 
demonstrate the effectiveness of 
nudging—the program increased 
the number of people agreeing to be 
donors from fewer than 30 percent to 
80 percent. 
 Leaders can use nudging to influ￾ence people to make more ethical deci￾sions. Take the case of the company 
Slice, which sells short-term insurance 
to individuals running home-based 
businesses. The company’s goal was 
to encourage people to be more hon￾est when submitting insurance claims. 
The company accomplished its goal 
with the help of nudging. For instance, 
requiring claimants to film a short video 
to describe the claim was particularly 
useful, likely because people are less 
likely to lie in a video than in writing. 
 Finally, many companies experience 
difficulty identifying abusive leaders 
before significant damage is done. Why? 
Leaders’ performance is commonly 
based on financial measures but not 
on the processes through which lead￾ers achieved those numbers. Executives 
can also use nudging to reduce abusive 
supervision in middle managers, team 
leaders, and front-line supervisors. 
Executives can employ a process-oriented 
performance management program 
for leaders, which bases employment 
decisions on specific actions leaders 
must take (rather than an exclusive 
focus on financial performance) and pro￾vides continuous feedback to leaders. 
This form of nudging alters the decision￾making architecture for both executives 
and leaders to prevent the escalation of 
undesirable behaviors. 
 Nonetheless, nudging is not without 
its challenges. Nudges are not always per￾ceived as helpful and may even be viewed 
as manipulative or patronizing. However, 
there are steps that managers can take to 
overcome negative perceptions of nudging: 
1. Be transparent about the purpose of 
nudges. One misconception is that 
nudges must be hidden to be effec￾tive, but to the contrary, disclosing a 
nudge has not been found to affect 
its impact. Transparency can help to 
resolve suspicion that individuals 
may have about a nudge. 
2. Co-creating nudges helps to re￾spect employee autonomy, priori￾tize solutions, and avoid potential 
roadblocks. When employees are 
involved in the process, nudges are 
likely to be more effective, as they 
consider their needs and the spe￾cific decisions they frequently face. 
3. Constructive framing is vital. For ex￾ample, framing nudges in a health 
care system as helping physicians 
avoid mistakes may be viewed nega￾tively. In contrast, framing nudges 
as a way to provide physicians with 
performance feedback can be more 
constructive and motivating. 44
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 403 21/12/22 6:53 AM404 PART 3 The Group
Summary of Trait Theories and Behavioral Theories
In general, research indicates there is validity for both the trait and behavioral 
theories. Parts of each theory can help explain facets of leadership emergence 
and effectiveness. However, identifying the exact relationships is not a simple 
task. The first difficulty is in correctly identifying whether a trait or a behavior 
predicts a certain outcome. The second is in exploring which combinations of 
traits and behaviors yield certain outcomes. The third challenge is to determine 
the causality of traits to behaviors so that predictions toward desirable leader￾ship outcomes can be made.
This final challenge is complicated by the varieties of contexts and situations 
leaders may find themselves in. Some leaders may have the right traits or display 
the right behaviors—but still fail. Context matters, too, which has given rise to 
the contingency theories we discuss next.
Contingency Theories
Some leaders seem to gain a lot of admirers when they take over struggling 
companies and lead them out of crises. For example, Alfred Glancy III saved 
the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO) as it teetered on the edge of failing. 
However, predicting leadership success is more complex than merely leading a 
group out of crisis. Glancy dealt with a lot of this complexity: refusing to spend 
beyond the DSO’s means, negotiating labor agreements, resolving the debt 
burden, and amplifying fundraising efforts—all while staying true to the art. 
Importantly, the leadership style that works in tough times does not necessar￾ily translate to long-term success. For example, after times got better, Glancy 
turned to more innovative approaches to developing the DSO: upgrading the 
technology of its global webcast series and improving lighting and electronics in 
the Orchestra Hall, among other innovative approaches. As you can see, being 
an effective leader can be highly contingent upon situational demands.45
The Fiedler Model
Fred Fiedler developed the first comprehensive contingency model for lead￾ership.46 The Fiedler contingency model proposes that group performance 
depends on the proper match between a leader’s style and the degree to 
which the situation gives a leader control. According to this model, leader￾ship styles reflect the degree to which leaders approach situations from either 
a task-oriented or relationship-oriented perspective. These leadership styles align 
with the degree to which they use the initiating structure or consideration 
behaviors discussed earlier. Moreover, these leadership styles are generally 
assumed to be stable or permanent.
With regard to the situation, we can assess it in terms of three contingency or 
situational dimensions:
1. Leader–member relations is the degree of confidence, trust, and respect 
that members have in their leader.
2. Task structure is the degree to which the job assignments are regimented 
(that is, structured or unstructured).
3. Position power is the degree of influence a leader has over power variables 
such as hiring, firing, discipline, promotions, and salary increases.
According to the model, the more structured the leader’s job assignment 
becomes and the stronger the position power given to the leader, the more

control the leader has. The favorable situations are on the left side of the 
model in Exhibit 12-1. A very favorable situation (in which the leader has a 
great deal of control) might include a payroll manager who has the respect 
and confidence of the employees (good leader–member relations); activi￾ties that are clear and specific—such as wage computation, check writing, 
and report filing (high task structure); and considerable freedom to reward 
and punish employees (strong position power). An unfavorable situation, 
to the right in the exhibit, might be that of the disliked chairperson of a vol￾unteer fundraising team (low leader–member relations, low task structure, 
low position power). In this job, the leader has very little control. According 
to the theory, when faced with extreme situations (e.g., very favorable or 
unfavorable conditions; categories I, II, III, VII, and VIII), task-oriented 
leaders perform better. Relationship-oriented leaders (represented by the 
solid line), however, perform better in moderately favorable situations—
categories IV, V, and VI.
Studies testing the overall validity of the Fiedler model were initially support￾ive, but the model has not been studied much in recent years.47 Furthermore, 
some of the predictions from Fiedler’s theory have not been supported: For 
instance, relationship-oriented leaders have been found to perform very well in 
favorable conditions.48 While it provides some insights that we should consider, 
our understanding of how the situation affects leadership has advanced with 
more modern contingency theories.
Situational Leadership Theory
Similar to the Fiedler model, Hersey and Blanchard’s situational leadership 
theory (SLT) also assumes that the effectiveness of any leadership style depends 
on the situation and tasks involved.49 However, SLT moves beyond Fiedler to 
situational leadership theory (SLT)
A contingency theory that suggests the 
appropriate leadership style depends on 
followers’ readiness (e.g., willingness and 
competence) to accomplish a specific task.

focus on the followers. It says that successful leadership depends on selecting 
the right leadership style contingent on the followers’ readiness, the extent to 
which followers are committed toward and competent in accomplishing a spe￾cific task. Leadership styles represent different combinations of supportive and 
directive behavior, which closely align with the consideration and initiating 
structure behaviors described earlier. A leader should choose one of four styles 
depending on follower readiness, which progresses on a continuum based on 
experience with the task, as shown in Exhibit 12-2:50
• Telling/directing (used when followers are not quite competent, but are 
committed to do the task): The leader gives clear and specific directions 
on what to do and how to do it.
• Selling/coaching (used when followers have demonstrated some com￾petence but are not quite committed or motivated to do the task—they 
are discouraged because they realize how far they have to go): The leader 
should continue to give clear and specific directions on what to do and how 
to do it but also should provide support, socio-emotional feedback, and en￾couragement and convince the employee that the task is worthwhile.
• Participating/supporting (used when followers are competent but have 
variable commitment to do the task—they worry about additional respon￾sibility or feel insecure): Given the employee’s acquired competence at the 
task, the leader should take a step back and no longer be as directive—but 
should continue to be supportive and provide encouragement.
• Delegating (used when followers are competent and committed to do the 
task): The employee is now fully capable and committed to the task—they 
can now be delegated the task and left alone to get it done.

and builds on the logic that leaders can adapt to their followers’ readiness to 
accomplish specific tasks. Yet research efforts to test and support the theory 
have generally been disappointing.51 Why? Possible explanations include inter￾nal ambiguities and inconsistencies in the model itself 52 as well as problems 
with research methodology. Despite its intuitive appeal and wide popularity, any 
endorsement must be cautious for now.
Follower Contingency Theories
The final contingency theories we cover concern the role that followers play. As 
one leadership scholar noted, “Leaders do not exist in a vacuum”; leadership 
is a symbiotic relationship between leaders and followers.53 But the theories we 
have covered to this point assume that leaders use a homogeneous style with 
everyone in their work unit. Think about your experiences in groups. Did lead￾ers often act very differently toward different people? Here, we discuss three 
theories that highlight the role of followers in shaping leader effectiveness: the 
leader–participation model, shared leadership, and followership.
Leader–Participation Model The leader–participation model relates leadership 
behavior to subordinate participation in decision making.54 Like the previous con￾tingency theories we have discussed, this theory suggests that leader behavior must 
adjust to reflect the task structure (such as routine, nonroutine, or in between) 
and the demands of the situation.55 However, it does not cover all leadership 
behaviors and is limited to recommending what types of decisions might be best 
made with subordinate participation and shared responsibility. It lays the ground￾work for the situations and leadership behaviors most likely to elicit acceptance 
from subordinates and serves as a precursor to shared leadership theory (which we 
discuss next). For example, Steve Kerr, coach of the Golden State Warriors, notes 
that it is not enough to be a leader and manage the players—he relies on them to 
be involved and set examples as well when the situation calls for it.56
Shared Leadership Theory As suggested by the leader–participation model, 
sometimes the situation calls for followers to play an active role in the decision 
making that affects the team, work group, or unit. Shared leadership theory
takes this idea a step further to suggest that leadership can become an emergent 
state (see the chapter on teams) in which leadership roles are distributed across 
followers, and all are capable of influencing one another.57 Notably, shared 
leadership shifts the assumption that leadership is something enacted by one 
person to a broader understanding of leadership that is capable of being enacted 
by a collective.
Shared leadership is possible in teams and groups with a strongly held shared 
purpose, flexible roles, composed of proactive and functionally diverse mem￾bers and in an environment characterized by social support, autonomy, and psy￾chological safety.58 Moreover, it is less likely to occur directly after a team forms 
(when members are still navigating the new structure) and toward the end of 
a team’s tenure (when teamwork and processes are “wrapping up”).59 Reviews 
of the research on shared leadership suggest that, overall, shared leadership is 
effective at improving team performance, attitudes, and behaviors, especially 
when members engage in transformational or charismatic practices (see later 
in this chapter) and when the team tasks are complex.60 This is because shared 
leadership can help build trust, empathy, and cohesion among members, which 
can help them become more effective as a team.61 Shared leadership can also 
lead to creativity and innovation benefits, as followers are more likely to support 
leader–participation model A theory that 
suggests leaders should determine the 
extent to which leadership problems involve 
participation and shared responsibility with 
followers (and adjust accordingly).

one another during the idea generation process, derive a sense of purpose and 
meaning from working together creatively, and be well equipped to make these 
ideas a reality.62
Of all the contingency theories discussed so far, shared leadership theory 
has been one of the most popular in recent years. It is not strictly a contin￾gency theory as shared leadership could be a relatively permanent fixture of a 
team or group. However, we classify it as such because followers step up to the 
ever-changing leadership problems and challenges confronting teams in a 
way that best suits their ability levels and strengths.63 Shared leadership could 
be especially useful in teams operating within extreme, volatile contexts. For 
instance, medical teams in emergency trauma centers often share leadership 
responsibilities in an almost improvisational way—when a problem comes up, 
leadership responsibilities are quickly delegated to the members of the team 
most suited to address those problems.64 However, shared leadership is not 
always beneficial. It can lead to both task and relationship conflict when the 
members who make up the group (and share leadership) operate from dif￾ferent levels of power (see the next chapter on power and politics).65
Followership Theory Like the contingency theories we have discussed so far, fol￾lowership theory places a heavy emphasis on followers in affecting the success of 
leadership. In many ways, followership “flips the leadership script” to focus on the 
follower’s capability to put into practice a leader’s vision or set of goals (compare 
with our definition of leadership from earlier).66 Therefore, the success of a leader 
depends heavily on the quality and makeup of the followers they are attempting to 
influence toward a common goal or visions. Moreover, the leader’s emotion and 
behavior can be affected or influenced by followers: Engaged followers can lead to 
engaged leaders; exhausted followers can lead to exhausted leaders.67
A key element of followership theory is perception—much like what we 
have discussed so far with leadership. In other words, people’s perceptions of 
what makes for ideal follower traits and behavior matter in the same way they 
do for leaders.68 So what makes for an excellent follower?69 Research suggests 
that the ideal follower is an industrious, enthusiastic, “good citizen” or “team 
player.” These followers can be described as hardworking, productive, excited, 
outgoing, happy, loyal, and reliable. They are also more likely to engage in 
organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs)—going above and beyond. A poor 
follower is one who is prone to insubordination, incompetence, and conformity. 
Followers who are easily influenced, follow trends, and do not speak up when 
the time calls for it can lead to stagnation in the group. Furthermore, arrogant, 
rude, or ill-tempered followers can cause or exacerbate relationship conflict 
that gets in the way of the vision or goals of the group. Lastly, if the followers 
are not equipped to make the dream a reality (e.g., they lack the knowledge, 
skills, abilities, or experiences required), they can be a detriment to the leader’s 
vision. Ultimately, these perceptions matter for perceptions of both follower and
leader performance,70 especially when the way in which followers present them￾selves is authentic.71
Moreover, “managing up” has become a recent buzzword in the popular 
press72 but possesses many parallels with followership theory. However, this 
concept expands followership to focus on the same types of skills manag￾ers and leaders use to influence followers and directs them upward toward 
leaders themselves. The idea is for followers to appreciate and adapt to lead￾ers who have different perspectives, learn to navigate and influence them 
toward the good of the team, and figure out how to forge a productive work￾ing relationship.73 Followership and “managing up” are both relatively new 
followership The capability of followers to 
put into practice a leader’s vision or set of 
goals.

concepts, but we expect OB to continue to move in the direction of under￾standing what makes followers “tick” and how they can be effective in teams 
and organizations.
Leading in Times of Crisis
A popular English proverb states, “Cometh the hour, cometh the man.” Despite 
its sexist phrasing,74 this proverb suggests that during times of crisis, leaders 
will emerge to bring order and understanding to the chaos.75 Indeed, lead￾ers can and do emerge during times of crisis, although there is variability in 
how effective they are at handling this contingency. For example, during the 
COVID-19 outbreak of 2020, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was praised 
for her impressive, decisive, firm, evidence-based, and effective leadership. And 
these are not merely attributions—under her leadership, Germany had one of 
the lowest fatality rates in the world when the virus broke out.76 During times 
of peace and stability, women leaders tend to under-emerge due to the glass cliff
phenomenon (see the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organi￾zations for more discussion).77 Because of this think crisis-think female effect, 
women are not seen as leaders during status quo periods, often due to leader 
stereotypes of not being agentic enough that prevent their emergence (despite 
little evidence indicating that they are more or less effective than men).78 This 
phenomenon is just one of the many indicators that leadership in crisis is not 
as simple as the “cometh the hour” proverb would suggest—not to mention the 
time pressure, complexity, and strain from the threat these stressful situations 
impose.79
Leaders in times of crisis, such as decorated combat heroes of World War 
II, are often thought of in mythical, heroic terms: eager, loyal, risk-taking, 
transformational, and so on.80 Interestingly, one review of historical leadership 
incidents across several decades suggested that much of the successful leader￾ship episodes involved transactional behaviors (as defined later in this chap￾ter), such as strategizing (e.g., analyzing the situation, delegating, planning) 
and coordinating (e.g., orchestrating action, managing information flow).81
Analyzing the situation appears to be particularly important, and research 
demonstrates that leaders managing crisis teams move quickly toward a shared 
mental model (see the chapter on teams) of the crisis with followers over 
time.82 Emotions also play a large role: For example, in one study, a leader 
responsible for a product recall that cost an organization a lot of money was 
rated more favorably when accepting responsibility and expressing sadness (as 
opposed to denial and anger).83
Of all the leadership styles during times of crisis, charismatic leadership has 
been studied the most frequently. During times of crisis, charismatic leadership 
can be visionary (e.g., starting with establishing a vision and then making a plea 
for action) or crisis-responsive (e.g., starting with a plea for action and, over time, 
justifying this action by communicating its effective results).84 Both forms can 
be effective in different ways, although the crisis-responsive approach tends to 
be used less frequently once the crisis ends.85 Followers are also highly attuned 
to the crisis, and this affects their leadership attributions. For example, analyses 
of presidential elections suggest that perceptions of crisis predict voters’ attri￾butions of candidate charisma and their intentions to vote for candidates who 
are charismatic.86 The effects of charismatic and transformational leadership 
during times of crisis may even reverberate after the crisis is over. For example, 
a study of U.S. Army unit leaders suggests that transformational leaders observe 
less unit turnover after the crisis is over and that these soldiers feel more embed￾ded in their unit due to their shared experiences.87

Positive Leadership Styles 
and Relationships
The understanding of leadership is a constantly evolving science. In recent 
years, contemporary theories have focused on the positive ways in which leaders 
influence and build quality exchange relationships with their followers. First, we 
describe leader–member exchange (LMX) theory, which describes how leaders 
form unique relationships with each of their followers. Then we describe charis￾matic leadership and full-range leadership theory, which attempt to characterize 
the positive ways in which leaders capture followers’ attention and motivations.
Leader–Member Exchange (LMX) Theory
Think of a leader you know. Does this leader have favorite followers who make 
up their “ingroup”? If you answered yes, you are acknowledging leader–member 
exchange (LMX) theory.
88 LMX suggests leaders and followers have unique, one￾on-one relationships that vary with each follower (e.g., some are higher quality 
than others). It also suggests that leaders establish a special relationship with a 
small group of their followers. These individuals make up the ingroup—they 
are trusted, get a disproportionate amount of the leader’s attention, and are 
more likely to receive special privileges. Other followers fall into the outgroup.
For the relationship to remain intact, the leader and the follower must invest 
in the relationship (see Exhibit 12-3). Competent, conscientious, proactive, and 
positive employees tend to have higher-quality relationships with their lead￾ers and are more likely to be placed in the ingroup (along with those who are 
ingratiating and self-promoting).89 Leaders induce higher-quality LMX percep￾tions by engaging in emotional labor, transformational leadership behaviors, 
ingratiating their followers, rewarding employees with whom they want a closer 
linkage, and punishing those with whom they do not.90 When leaders and fol￾lowers interact with one another, research suggests that leaders and followers 
build social capital with one another—they contribute more to the relationship 
when they feel obligated to and will withhold contribution when they believe 
they have “done enough.”91 In general, however, leaders and followers tend 
to develop high-quality relationships over time when the supervisor has high 
expectations for the follower, when they see themselves as similar, when they like 
each other, and when they trust each other.92 Leaders and followers of the same 
gender tend to have closer (higher LMX) relationships than those of different 
leader–member exchange (LMX) theory
A theory that suggests (1) leaders and 
followers have unique relationships that vary 
in quality and (2) these followers comprise 
ingroups and outgroups; subordinates 
with ingroup status will likely have higher 
performance ratings, less turnover, and 
greater job satisfaction.

relationships.

genders.93 Regardless of LMX quality perceptions, it is also true that LMX more 
or less varies in importance for leaders and followers. (Some employees value 
LMX less than others.)94
Research to test LMX theory has been generally supportive, with substan￾tive evidence that leaders do differentiate among followers. These disparities 
are far from random. Followers with ingroup status receive higher performance 
ratings (and objectively perform better), engage in more helping or OCBs at 
work, engage in fewer deviant or counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs), 
speak up when the situation calls for it, and report greater satisfaction with their 
leaders.95 LMX influences these work outcomes by improving employee trust, 
motivation, empowerment, and job satisfaction (although trust has the largest 
effect).96 LMX is strongly linked to psychological and physical well-being at work 
as well as reduced stress and burnout symptoms—for instance, followers are less 
likely to feel ostracized or left out.97 LMX has even been linked to enhanced 
employability and career success, with employees with strong LMX reporting 
higher salaries, bonuses, and promotions than other employees.98
Furthermore, the extent to which leaders “play favorites” and create explicit 
in- and outgroups tends to have a negative effect on group or team outcomes. 
Although LMX only has a weak effect on group performance, when leaders play 
favorites, it negatively affects team attitudes, collective efficacy, justice climate, 
and coordination and can lead to conflict in teams.99 But this does not seem 
to be the case when the exchanges are based on team members’ actual perfor￾mance (and not just playing favorites).100 On the other hand, the overall level 
of LMX quality among members of the team (how strongly followers tend to 
see their relationships with their leaders) tends to matter more for work group 
or team outcomes.101 In other words, if the leader treats everyone well to some 
degree, followers will likely be happy. Similar to substitutes for leadership the￾ory (discussed later in the chapter), the quality of exchange between coworkers 
and colleagues can often substitute for or offset the negative impacts of low 
LMX in teams.102
There are some boundary conditions for the effects of LMX, however. For 
example, it appears as if LMX’s relationship with perceptions of trust, job satis￾faction, and justice as well as with OCBs and turnover intentions depends in part 
on the culture—in a study of nearly 70,000 employees from twenty-three coun￾tries, the researchers found that LMX matters more in individualistic rather 
than collectivistic cultures.103 Another limitation is that the agreement between 
leaders and followers on their relationship quality (e.g., a boss might think the 
relationship is great, the follower might not) is not very strong—when there is 
disagreement between the two, this can hurt employee engagement (regardless 
of who perceives the relationship as stronger).104
Charismatic Leadership
There is just “something” about certain leaders that causes people to be drawn 
toward them. There is an undeniable presence to leaders like Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and former president Barack Obama, which 
can be explained in part by their abilities to unite and transform people.105 Two 
contemporary leadership theories—charismatic leadership and transforma￾tional leadership (to be discussed shortly)—share a common theme in the great 
leader debate: They view leaders as individuals who inspire followers through 
words, ideas, and behaviors.
What Is Charismatic Leadership? Sociologist Max Weber defined charisma (from 
the Greek for “gift”) as “a certain quality of an individual personality, by virtue 
of which [they are] set apart from ordinary people and treated as endowed 
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 411 21/12/22 6:53 AM412 PART 3 The Group
with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or 
qualities. These are not accessible to the ordinary person and are regarded as 
of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual con￾cerned is treated as a leader.”106
According to charismatic leadership theory, followers attribute heroic or 
extraordinary leadership abilities when they observe certain behaviors (e.g., 
those that are values-driven, symbolic, or emotion-laden) and tend to give these 
leaders power.107 A number of studies have attempted to identify the character￾istics of charismatic leaders: They have a vision, have a sense of mission, are will￾ing to take personal risks to achieve that vision, are sensitive to follower needs, 
and exhibit extraordinary behaviors (i.e., they “go against the flow”)108 (see 
Exhibit 12-4). Some research has also linked intelligence (both cognitive ability 
and being able to “see the big picture”), extroversion, and agreeableness to the 
motivational and influential factors of charismatic leadership.109 Charismatic 
leadership theory suggests that these personality traits enable leaders to react to 
work events with a positive attitude, and their EI enables them to influence fol￾lowers to unite and constructively confront the adverse work event.110

1. Vision and articulation. Has a vision—expressed as an idealized goal—that proposes a
future better than the status quo; able to clarify the importance of the vision in terms
that are understandable to others.
2. Personal risk. Willing to take on high personal risk, incur high costs, and engage in self￾sacrifice to achieve the vision.
3. Sensitivity to follower needs. Perceptive of others’ abilities and responsive to their needs
and feelings.
4. Unconventional behavior. Engages in behaviors that are perceived as novel and counter
to norms.

How Charismatic Leaders Influence Followers Charismatic leadership has a posi￾tive effect on follower outcomes: Such leaders can, for instance, enhance fol￾lower task performance and OCB as well as reduce/reframe follower turnover 
and stressors.111 But how do charismatic leaders influence followers? By articulat￾ing an appealing vision, a long-term strategy for attaining a goal by linking the 
present with a better future for their team, group, or organization.112 Desirable 
visions fit the times and circumstances as well as reflect the uniqueness of the 
organization. Thus, followers are inspired not only by how passionately the leader 
communicates and their nonverbal cues (e.g., extended eye contact)113 but also 
by an appealing message. For example, charismatic principals that promote a 
shared vision among teachers can improve the organizational climate (see the 
chapter on organizational culture) and, as a result, improve school outcomes.114
A vision needs an accompanying vision statement, a formal articulation of 
an organization’s vision or mission.115 Charismatic leaders may use vision state￾ments to imprint on followers an overarching goal and purpose. These lead￾ers also set a tone of cooperation and mutual support. They build followers’ 
self-esteem and confidence with high performance expectations and the belief 
that followers can attain them.116 Through words and actions, the leader con￾veys a new set of values and sets an example for followers to imitate. Finally, 
the charismatic leader engages in emotion-inducing and often unconventional 
behavior to demonstrate courage and conviction about the vision.
Research indicates that charismatic leadership works as followers “catch” the emo￾tions that their leader is conveying.117 Notably, charismatic managers may seem to 
have an air of mystique and magnetism around them: These perceptions are aroused 
when they seem to be successful for mysterious reasons and when the effects of their 
charisma spread across followers.118 Some personalities are especially susceptible to 
charismatic leadership.119 For instance, an individual who lacks self-esteem or has low 
core self-evaluations is more likely to absorb a leader’s direction. For these people, the 
situation may matter much less than the charismatic qualities of the leader.
Does Effective Charismatic Leadership Depend on the Situation? Charismatic leader￾ship has positive effects across many contexts. However, there are characteristics of 
the situation that enhance or somewhat limit its effects. One factor that enhances 
charismatic leadership is stress. People are especially receptive to charismatic lead￾ership when they sense a crisis or when they are under stress, perhaps because we 
think bold leadership is needed. Some of it, however, may be more primal. When 
people are psychologically aroused, even in laboratory studies, they are more likely 
to respond to charismatic leaders, especially when they use language that is construc￾tive and “promotion-oriented” rather than that which does not propose solutions 
and focuses on the negative.120 Stress matters for leaders, too: When leaders are 
under stress, they may not have the resources to engage in charismatic behaviors.121
Stress may explain why, when charismatic leaders surface, they are likely to be in 
politics or religion, during wartime, or when a business is in its infancy or facing 
a threatening crisis. For example, U.S. President Donald Trump (despite the con￾troversy and divisiveness surrounding his presidency) offered a charismatic vision 
to “make America great again,” which was met with open arms by many, possibly 
due to a state of alarm or crisis nurtured and encouraged by the media.122 Another 
factor is ambiguity: When we cannot accurately assess or observe how someone is 
doing, we rely more on cues (e.g., charismatic behaviors) to assess whether they 
are being effective as a leader. For example, one study of both U.S. presidents and 
CEOs found that charisma was more likely to predict whether a leader is selected or 
appointed, especially when the situation was ambiguous.123

or constituents.124 Research has shown that individuals who are narcissistic are also 
higher in some behaviors associated with charismatic leadership.125 Furthermore, 
research suggests that charismatic leadership can unduly distort follower fair￾ness perceptions: Because they see the charismatic leader in a positive light, they 
may be (consciously or not) more willing to perceive them as fair.126 In essence, 
charismatic leadership is a positive leadership tool that can be used for nefari￾ous means. Many charismatic—but corrupt—leaders have allowed their personal 
goals to override the goals of their organizations. Corporate leaders around the 
globe recklessly used organizational resources for their personal benefit and 
unethically violated laws to inflate stock prices, and then cashed in millions of 
dollars in personal stock options. For instance, the leaders at blood-testing firm 
Theranos and trucking startup Nikola lied about the capabilities of its technology 
but convinced investors of the technology’s ingenuity and impact.127 It is not that 
charismatic leadership is not effective; overall, it is. But a charismatic leader is not 
always the answer. Success depends on the situation, on the leader’s vision, and on 
the organizational checks and balances in place to monitor the outcomes.
The Full Range Leadership Model
The full range leadership model suggests that there are a number of approaches 
or styles of leadership (i.e., laissez-faire, transactional, and transformational) 
that vary on a continuum from passive and ineffective to active and effective. 
Exhibit 12-5 illustrates the full range leadership model, and Exhibit 12-6 out￾lines characteristics of each of the model’s seven leadership styles.

M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 414 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 415
Laissez-Faire Leadership Let us start with the most ineffective leadership 
style. According to a survey by Right Management, only 17 percent of employ￾ees report that their supervisors are actively engaged in developing them, yet 
68 percent report that their supervisors are not engaged in this way at all.128
Those in the 68 percent likely have leaders who primarily use laissez-faire lead￾ership styles. Laissez-faire leadership, which literally means “let it be” (or “do 
nothing”) in French, is the most passive and therefore least effective of leader 
behaviors.129 Although laissez-faire leadership is passive, its effects are not also 
passive.130 Contrary to what you might predict, members of a team led by a 
laissez-faire leader generally do not “step up” to fill the leadership void. Instead, 
in line with social learning theory (see the chapter on motivation theories), 
team members tend to also neglect leadership behaviors, which then harms 
team performance, mirroring their passive leader’s behavior.131 Laissez-faire 
leaders also can do emotional harm to their followers. For instance, many fol￾lowers often define themselves through their relationships with others, includ￾ing their supervisors. For these employees, a passive, laissez-fair leader makes 
them feel like there is low-quality LMX and may lead them to experience lower 
commitment toward the organization.132 This has particular implications for 
followers who experience bullying or mistreatment—supervisors who “do noth￾ing” can encourage role conflict and ambiguity, relational conflicts, mistreat￾ment, and stressful working environments.133
Transactional Leadership Transactional leaders guide their followers toward 
established goals by clarifying role and task requirements, allocating rewards 
and punishment where needed (i.e., contingent rewards), and (passively or 
actively) intervening when the situation calls for it (i.e., management by excep￾tion).134 The types of transactional leadership are presented in Exhibit 12-6.

monitor employee performance for errors, and interact with followers only 
when something is wrong, is generally ineffective as a style of leadership.135
Notably, management by exception can be utilized either actively or passively, 
with the passive form tending to be more ineffective.136 Contingent reward lead￾ership, which gives predetermined rewards for employee efforts, can be an 
effective style of leadership but will not get employees to go above and beyond 
the call of duty.137
Some of the leadership approaches we discussed earlier, including 
situational leadership theory, tend to focus on a transactional approach. 
Sometimes, transactional leadership approaches are needed.138 For 
example, research on offshore rig employees suggests that leaders who 
actively intervene when the situation calls for it lead employees to become 
more engaged in safety behaviors, especially given the high likelihood of 
accidents.139
Transformational Leadership Transformational leaders, on the other hand, 
inspire followers to transcend their self-interests for the good of the organiza￾tion.140 Transformational leaders can have an extraordinary effect on their 
followers.141 In her book Leadership in Turbulent Times, Doris Kearns Goodwin 
describes the transformational qualities of past presidents such as Abraham 
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson, who personally appealed 
to Americans and inspired followers to make sacrifices to pursue goals for the 
country.142 There is evidence that whether leaders engage in transformational 
behaviors depends to a large extent on culture and industry. For example, one 
review of dozens of studies from 18 different countries suggests that transfor￾mational leadership may be used more often in the health and security indus￾tries as well as in cultures worldwide that value assertiveness and egalitarian￾ism and are lower on power distance.143
Exhibit 12-6 briefly identifies and defines characteristics of transforma￾tional leadership styles. Individualized consideration, intellectual stimulation, 
inspirational motivation, and idealized influence (known as the “four I’s”) all 
result in extra effort from workers, higher productivity, higher creativity, higher 
well-being, higher morale and satisfaction, higher organizational effectiveness, 
higher psychological safety (and follower freedom to speak up when needed), 
improved psychological and physical health, lower turnover, lower absenteeism, 
and greater organizational adaptability.144
Integrating and Evaluating Positive Leadership Styles
First, one clear conclusion can be drawn regarding laissez-faire leadership: You 
probably should not use it. Laissez-faire leadership, or doing nothing (often 
when something should be done), mostly results in destructive outcomes like 
social loafing, harmed interpersonal relationships, and the perpetuation of 
toxic group or work environments. However, a comparison between charismatic, 
transactional, and transformational styles is somewhat trickier. Although all of 
these styles can be useful in their own right, transformational leadership tends 
to consistently result in optimal leadership outcomes. Therefore, in this section, 
we primarily focus on how charismatic and transactional leadership stack up to 
transformational leadership.
Transformational Versus Charismatic Leadership First, in considering trans￾formational and charismatic leadership, you surely noticed some common￾alities. There are differences, too. As discussed in a prior section, charismatic 
leaders are those who make value-based appeals and communicate through 
transformational leaders Leaders who 
inspire followers to transcend their own self￾interests for the good of the organization.
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 416 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 417
symbolic and emotion-laden means.145 Charismatic leadership places some￾what more emphasis on the way leaders communicate (are they passionate 
and dynamic?), while transformational leadership focuses more on what they 
are communicating (is it individualized, intellectually stimulating, inspira￾tional, and influential?).146 At their heart, both focus on the leader’s ability to 
inspire followers, and sometimes they do so in the same way and with similar 
degrees of effectiveness.
Transformational Versus Transactional Leadership Transactional and transforma￾tional leadership complement each other; they are not opposing approaches 
to getting things done.147 Transformational leadership builds on transactional 
leadership and produces levels of follower effort and performance beyond what 
transactional leadership alone can do. Although both tend to be important, it 
appears that transformational leadership is more important for group perfor￾mance, OCBs, and satisfaction with the leader, whereas transactional leadership 
(primarily contingent reward) is more important for leader effectiveness, 
follower performance, and follower job satisfaction.148 Also, as mentioned ear￾lier, transactional leadership behaviors, like management by exception (active), 
are also important in their own right for effective task performance and safety 
behaviors in organizations.149
Many researchers have commented on how the contingent reward
aspect of transactional leadership appears to be just as effective as many 
of the transformational approaches to leadership, although the man￾agement by exception approach does lag behind in effectiveness.150
Interestingly, newer research suggests that management by exception may 
be a double-edged sword—it has both pros and cons, which offset each 
other.151 When managers actively or passively monitor followers and only 
step in when they are needed, followers may feel empowered to do their 
jobs autonomously (e.g., they are not being micromanaged). This can lead 
to heightened task performance and OCBs. However, at the same time, 
these employees may also feel like they have lower-quality LMX relation￾ships with their leaders. If their leaders are only stepping in when there is 
a problem, they are probably not engaging in relationship-building behav￾iors, which can harm their LMX, performance, and OCBs. These find￾ings highlight just how important the situational approach is to effective 
deployment of these styles: Always be mindful of situational demands and 
the leadership styles that may be most effective in meeting those demands, 
and work toward addressing unintended side effects of the leadership 
style you choose.
What Makes Transformational Leadership So Great? Overall, an exhaustive pro￾gram of research has sought to discover why transformational leadership is so 
effective.152 In general, researchers have found that it is, effective for five rea￾sons (many of which correspond with various chapters in this book):153
1. Affective or attitudinal mechanism: Transformational approaches promote 
positive employee moods, emotions, job satisfaction, organizational com￾mitment, and feelings of well-being.
2. Motivational mechanism: Transformational approaches motivate employees—
they become more confident and engaged and are more willing to put in 
the time and effort.
3. Identification mechanism: Transformational approaches lead employees to 
personally identify with the leader and the leader’s values and identity as 
well as the team or organization.
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 417 21/12/22 6:53 AM418 PART 3 The Group
4. Social exchange mechanism: Transformational approaches improves the 
quality of exchange and relationship between leaders and followers (i.e., 
LMX; see earlier in this chapter). Followers are also more likely to perceive 
that they are supported by the leader, team, and/or organization.
5. Justice enhancement mechanism: Transformational approaches improve 
employee fairness perceptions, motivating followers to contribute more and 
to trust the leader, team, and organization more.
Research suggests that the “social exchange mechanism” is the primary “rea￾son” for why leadership behaviors and styles influence outcomes: Behaviors that 
improve perceptions of leader–follower relationship quality (e.g., LMX), in turn, 
result in improved follower performance.154 Although the other reasons are just 
as important, it seems as if they operate through improved social exchange and 
LMX. In other words, (1) transformational leadership approaches improve the 
leader–follower relationship; (2) then this improved relationship paves the way 
for positive affective, attitudinal, motivational, identification, and justice-related 
changes.
Are There Downsides to Transformational Leadership? In general, organiza￾tions perform better when they have transformational leaders. However, 
transformational leadership is not without its critics, some of whom boldly 
claim that transformational leadership behaviors can be construed as manip￾ulative and unduly granting power to inspirational people.155 Moreover, 
transformational leadership is not as “easy” as doing nothing or leading in 
more passive ways. Such leadership can take its toll on leaders, causing them 
to become emotionally exhausted and leave their leadership positions.156
This is especially the case when followers are low on conscientiousness and 
competence.157
Others have noted that transformational leadership theory could benefit 
from understanding which dimensions are most important, exactly how these 
combine to form transformational leadership, and how the dimensions of 
transformational leadership lead to different outcomes.158 More importantly, 
researchers have criticized the surveys with which transformational leadership 
is measured and suggest that transformational leadership is often confounded 
with outcomes. For example, do leaders give individualized attention, intel￾lectually stimulate, inspire, and influence? Or is it that followers perceive they 
are given unique consideration, intellectually stimulated, inspired, or influ￾enced? In other words, are these actual behaviors or merely desirable follower 
outcomes?159
The (Un)ethical Aspects of Leadership
Although the theories we have discussed so far have increased our understand￾ing of effective leadership, they do not deal explicitly with the roles of ethics 
and trust, which are essential to complete the picture. In this section, we con￾sider contemporary concepts that explicitly address the role of leaders in creat￾ing ethical organizations.
Authentic Leadership
Authentic leadership is practiced by leaders who are self-aware (e.g., they 
know what is important to them, including their own strengths/weaknesses), 
are anchored by their mission and principles, consider others’ opinions and 
all relevant information before acting, and display their true selves when

authentic leadership A leadership style in 
which leaders “know who they are” (i.e., self￾awareness), are anchored by their mission, 
consider others’ opinions and all relevant 
information before acting, and display their 
true selves when interacting with employees.
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 418 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 419
interacting with employees.160 The result: People have faith in them. For 
example, Nick Sarillo of Nick’s Pizza and Pub is authentic in how he runs 
his business—when one of the locations was not doing too well, he was pub￾licly open and transparent about the facts along with the need to close the 
store.161
Authentic leadership strongly predicts outcomes such as group perfor￾mance, OCBs, LMX, satisfaction and trust in the leader, ratings of leader 
effectiveness, follower attitudes and empowerment, and, to a lesser degree, 
follower creativity, engagement, deviance, turnover intentions, and burnout.162
Furthermore, research suggests that leaders who “practice what they preach” 
observe improved follower outcomes because their followers begin to trust 
them and become more committed to the organization.163 Authentic leaders 
can inspire their employees to be better: For example, research on Pakistani 
communications employees suggests that the awareness of one’s own strengths 
and weaknesses that comes from authentic leadership predicts followers’ inten￾tions to improve themselves.164 Moreover, authentic leadership inspires follow￾ers to be authentic themselves, which in turn influences their job attitudes and 
behaviors.165
Unfortunately, there appears to be a double standard for women when it 
comes to authenticity: In general, women are perceived to be more authen￾tic, especially when they engage in traditionally “feminine” hobbies and when 
they engage in “warm” leadership styles.166 However, if they engage in more 
assertive, transactional approaches (e.g., initiating structure, directive leader￾ship behaviors), this goes against the stereotype and may lead some to label 
them as inauthentic.167 These stereotypes have led many to comment on how 
Hillary Clinton was mocked as “Saint Hillary” when she stood behind her mes￾sage of “politics of meaning” in the 1990s but was branded as inauthentic when 
she adopted more traditionally masculine approaches to leadership during 
her presidential campaign decades later.168 Ironically, having more women in 
corporate leadership positions (e.g., corporate boards) leads to better financial 
performance than if these positions were composed of all men.169 This is true 
Brad Smith is an authentic leader. 
As the former CEO and current chair 
of Intuit (one of the globe’s biggest 
and most lucrative financial software 
companies), he is one of the most 
influential business leaders today, 
according to Forbes, and is known 
for his ethical practices. Smith has 
forged a culture where risk taking and 
learning from failures are not only 
tolerated but encouraged.

for both accounting performance measures and market performance measures. 
Recent research even suggested that women’s leadership was associated with 
fewer COVID-19 related deaths in the United States based on an analysis of 
women governors. 170
 Toward a Better World 
 The Institute for Corporate Social 
Responsibility (iCSR): Training Leaders to Work 
Toward a Better Tomorrow 
 Tamara Lucas Copeland (DEI con￾sultant, former president of the 
Washington DC Regional Association 
of Grantmakers, and alumna of 
the Institute for Corporate Social 
Responsibility [iCSR]) suggests that 
CSR just does not “happen” on its own 
in organizations. It takes a collective 
effort, often at the hands of knowledge￾able, skilled, and influential leadership. 
It takes a team learning together to 
develop a common skill set, making 
the business case for CSR activities, 
maximizing the impact of philanthropic 
funds raised, and effectively measuring 
success over time. Indeed, research 
suggests that CSR managers are often 
confronted with the onerous responsi￾bility of influencing and inspiring other 
managers to care about CSR initia￾tives. As these authors put it, “This 
could be a struggle . . . interviewees 
emphasized that when middle manag￾ers were asked to incorporate new CSR 
practices in their day-to-day work and 
decision making, the typical response 
was that those tasks weren’t in line 
with their financial goals.” Training and 
development programs at universities, 
in the private sector, and in the public 
sector provide an opportunity for exec￾utives and professionals to develop 
these skills to guide their organizations 
toward socially responsible visions. 
 iCSR was launched in 2014 to 
provide practical training and develop￾ment opportunities for leaders look￾ing to develop their CSR leadership 
skills. iCSR is offered in partnership 
with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
Foundation’s Corporate Citizenship 
Center. All graduates earn a certifi￾cate from the Johns Hopkins University 
in CSR en route. As of 2021, iCSR 
involves a virtual training program with 
two annual cohorts, each with about 
thirty-five students (to enhance mean￾ingful engagement with the course 
content). Trainees meet for forty-five￾minute Zoom sessions, network with 
other leaders, and take part in break￾out discussions and debates. The 
faculty teaching these courses are 
well-respected CSR executives from 
well-known companies like American 
Express, Capital One, IBM, PwC, 
Marriott International, Qualcomm, and 
Viacom. Past participants have also 
been leaders from major corporations, 
such as Aetna, Bank of America, Cigna, 
and Deloitte, among other companies. 
 The iCSR curriculum focuses on 
a mix of developing leader behaviors 
and skills as well as authentic, ethical, 
and servant leadership approaches. 
Throughout the course, trainees learn 
about the overall context, history, and 
evolution of CSR and environmental 
sustainability. With this context in 
mind, trainees learn how to build inter￾nal buy-in and convince others of the 
value of CSR, how to frame CSR work 
to others, and how to leverage authen￾tic leadership approaches. They also 
engage in values clarification exer￾cises, learn how to build their ethical 
decision-making skills, and engage 
and build trust with stakeholders. iCSR 
trainees build their transactional lead￾ership and initiating structure skills as 
well, learning how to develop internal 
policies and practices that support 
people and foster employee CSR￾related volunteerism, training, and 
upskilling. They also learn how to net￾work and influence others outside the 
organization by forging partnerships 
and philanthropic investment in CSR 
initiatives. Finally, attendees learn how 
to communicate the impact of CSR to 
stakeholders, executives, and consum￾ers to influence and communicate the 
value of the organization’s efforts. 
 But are these CSR leadership train￾ing and development programs effec￾tive? Research suggests that leaders’ 
abilities, skills, and experiences play a 
crucial role in affecting both CSR strat￾egy and effectiveness in organizations. 
Moreover, although attendees to these 
programs give glowing reviews of their 
experiences, more specific systematic 
research is needed on their effective￾ness. However, preliminary research 
shows that these training programs 
can be effective, but the trainees and 
situation matter quite a bit. To make 
CSR leadership training programs 
most successful, training developers 
should emphasize a learning culture 
and climate, provide opportunities for 
peer learning and interaction among 
students, and shift trainees’ motiva￾tions from proving or avoiding poor 
performance toward mastery of CSR 
skills. 173
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 420 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 421
Despite these interesting findings concerning the nature of authentic lead￾ership, reviews of the leadership literature point to how transformational and 
authentic leadership are extremely similar in practice, to the point where many 
researchers consider them to be identical.171 However, some work does suggest 
that authentic leadership is more important for explaining team performance 
and whether employees engage in OCBs because they have an internalized mis￾sion that propels the group forward.172
(Un)ethical Leadership
(Un)ethical leadership, although it has been conceptualized in many ways, refers 
to how leaders serve as ethical role models to followers and thus demonstrate 
normatively appropriate (or inappropriate) behavior by using their power in 
(un)ethical ways and by treating others fairly (or unfairly).174 (Un)ethical lead￾ership tends to affect employees in a number of ways.175 First, (un)ethical lead￾ership has a direct influence on how employees think about moral issues and 
establishes an organizational culture with clear values and principles for what 
is (un)ethical behavior.176 Second, ethical leadership sets the example for how 
employees should treat one another (therefore, reducing CWBs): It can lead 
employees to use less intimidation, justifications, and excuses for their behavior; 
it can empower employees to stand up and speak out in the face of injustice; and 
it can even improve customer service performance by clarifying moral reasons 
for treating customers right.177 Third, ethical leadership tends to improve fol￾lower job attitudes and follower perceptions of leaders—indeed, ethical leader￾ship tends to increase followers’ trust in their leaders, which in turn can lead 
to these positive outcomes.178 Lastly, ethical leadership has direct performance 
implications. It enhances task performance and OCB because it improves fol￾lowers’ relationship with leaders (i.e., LMX), establishes an ethical culture, and 
fosters organizational identification (see the chapter on job attitudes).179
Unfortunately, (un)ethical leadership tends to run into similar criticisms as 
authentic leadership because it is hard to disentangle it from transformational 
leadership in practice.180 Furthermore, it is hard to be consistently ethical: 
Leaders who were ethical on one day were more likely to be unethical the next 
day, often because of stressful circumstances, mental depletion, and a feeling 
that one has built up “credits” to behave in an unethical way.181 However, fol￾lowers do not necessarily act negatively to leader unethical behavior: If the fol￾lowers’ values align with the leader’s and they have a sense of mutual trust, they 
may be more likely to continue to support the leader.182 Furthermore, there 
are certain situations that reduce the effectiveness of ethical leadership. When 
there are too many followers, when the followers do not share the same moral 
perspectives as the leader (what if leaders and followers disagree on what is 
right and wrong?), and when followers are not in a state of mindfulness (see 
the chapter on health and stress), ethical leadership tends to be less effective at 
improving follower behaviors.183 Although every member of an organization is 
responsible for ethical behavior, many initiatives aimed at increasing organiza￾tional ethical behavior are focused on the leaders.
When considering corporate scandals, like Wells Fargo’s unethical sales 
practices in 2016, it is clear that ethics-based leadership is crucial at all levels of 
organizations.184 Ethical top leadership influences not only direct followers but 
all the way down the command structure as well.185 Ethical leadership also has 
implications for financial outcomes. For example, one study of 111 U.S. retail 
stores found that ethical leadership can reduce “retail shrink,” or the loss of 
merchandise primarily due to theft and shoplifting, because ethical leadership 
can reduce incivility among employees and customers.186
(un)ethical leadership The idea that 
leaders serve as ethical role models to 
followers and thus demonstrate appropriate 
(or inappropriate) behavior by using their 
power in (un)ethical ways and/or by treating 
others fairly (or unfairly).
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 421 21/12/22 6:53 AM422 PART 3 The Group
Servant Leadership
Servant leadership involves going beyond self-interest to focus on opportuni￾ties that help followers grow and develop.187 Characteristic behaviors include 
listening, empathizing, persuading, acceptance, stewardship, and actively devel￾oping followers’ potential.188 Because servant leadership is based on serving the 
needs of others, research has focused on its outcomes for the well-being of fol￾lowers. Indeed, servant leadership is strongly related to follower job attitudes 
as well as their trust in leadership and LMX perceptions.189 In turn, servant 
leadership predicts both job performance and OCB, albeit to a lesser degree 
than well-being and leadership quality.190 This may be due to follower feelings 
of gratitude that engender prosocial behavior and a need to reciprocate.191
Similar to authentic leadership, there appears to be an advantage for women 
who are servant leaders because the leadership style stereotypically matches the 
gender role prototype. In other words, women who draw on servant leadership 
techniques tend to inspire their use in their followers, which leads to higher 
performance than men servant leaders.192
Research also suggests that servant leadership may “fuel the service fire.” 
Research on hairstylists suggests that servant leaders help promote their sense 
of identity with the salon and their confidence, which in turn leads custom￾ers to rate their performance more highly.193 Furthermore, research suggests 
that there is a trickle-down effect: High-level managers who are servant lead￾ers can influence low-level managers to practice servant leadership, which in 
turn improves employee performance.194 Servant leadership is also beneficial 
during onboarding: Servant leadership may compensate for lower levels of new 
employee proactivity, as the servant leader takes the role in coaching the new 
employee.195 Lastly, servant leadership may play a large role during major cri￾ses. For instance, a study of employees working at an IT firm in China during 
the COVID-19 surge found that servant leadership was crucial in transforming 
employees’ anxieties and fears surrounding the virus into job engagement and 
socially responsible behavior.196
Although servant leadership is highly related to transformational, authentic, 
and ethical leadership (particularly the latter), research suggests that it holds 
the most promise “of standing on its own” as a unique leadership style in prac￾tice when compared with authentic and ethical leadership.197
Abusive Supervision
It can happen to anyone—we are all capable of being abusive as managers.198
For instance, in a 2018 Monster poll of U.S. job seekers, 76 percent of respon￾dents indicated that they currently have a toxic or abusive supervisor.199 Abusive 
supervision is a concern worldwide given its negative implications for OB.200
Although potentially a form of unethical leadership, abusive supervision refers 
to the perception that a supervisor is hostile in their verbal and nonverbal behav￾ior (e.g., uncontrolled outbursts, public ridicule, inappropriate blaming).201
Several factors are related to abusive supervision.202 For one, nearly all forms 
of justice are negatively related to abusive supervision, suggesting that a sense 
of injustice is at the core of abusive supervision (especially for interpersonal jus￾tice).203 Although some personality traits such as agreeableness and conscien￾tiousness appear to be negatively (but weakly) associated with abusive supervi￾sion,204 negative affect, narcissism, and poor self-control are strongly linked with 
it.205 These negative affects often come from supervisors’ own experiences of 
overload, emotional exhaustion, stress, and frustration—in fact, research shows 
that abusive supervision actually helps them cope with these negative emo￾tions and become more engaged in their work as a result.206 Recent research 
has also drawn on followership theory to focus on the characteristics of the 
servant leadership A leadership style 
marked by going beyond the leader’s 
own self-interest and instead focusing on 
opportunities to help followers grow and 
develop.
abusive supervision Supervision that is 
hostile both verbally and nonverbally.
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 422 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 423
followers reporting abusive supervision. For instance, followers with negative 
worldviews are more likely to report that they experience abusive supervision.207
Interestingly, both poor and high performers can become victims—poor per￾formers can be berated for their alleged incompetence, and high performers 
can be berated out of jealousy or threat to the hierarchy.208
Abusive supervision comes with dire consequences.209 First and foremost, abu￾sive supervision negatively affects employee health: It leads to increased depres￾sion, emotional exhaustion, and lower self-esteem as well as dehumanization, 
ostracism, and job tension perceptions.210 Second, it also leads to decreases in 
organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and perceived organizational sup￾port, along with increased work–family conflict.211 Third, it can adversely affect 
employee performance and other employee behaviors. Victims of abusive super￾vision are more prone to engage in CWBs and other deviant behaviors (espe￾cially retaliatory ones directed toward their supervisors) and are less prone to 
engage in OCBs.212 Finally, coworkers who observe abusive supervision are likely 
to fear that it may happen to themselves (or may believe that the group is not 
working hard enough) and work unduly harder as a result.213 However, in units 
with ethical, collaborative cultures and climates, these employees may be more 
likely to reach out and help the victims and call out the abusive supervisors.214
Abusive supervision often occurs in cycles. When employees are the victims 
of abusive supervision, they tend to lash out at the organization and the super￾visor by engaging in CWB and deviant behaviors, and the supervisor then con￾tinues to be abusive to the employees in retaliation.215 You may be wondering 
why the employee would lash out at the organization as well when it was the 
supervisor who was the one being abusive. Additional research suggests that 
employees often blame the organization when they are abused and see the 
supervisor as a representative of the organization as a whole.216 Furthermore, 
sometimes abusive supervision can “activate” employees’ dark traits, such as 
how Machiavellian employees engage in unethical behaviors when their super￾visors treat them abusively.217 But primarily, the CWBs and deviant behaviors 
are attributable to the emotions they feel as a result of being mistreated (e.g., 
shame, anger, fear).218
But leaders can also adopt abusive approaches by observing other leaders, so 
the phenomenon is not solely unique to leader–follower relations. New leaders 
who look up to abusive supervisors as competent and who view these behaviors 
as effective (e.g., “what it takes to be a leader”) are more likely to adopt these 
abusive behaviors.219 Moreover, supervisors who merely talk about abusive 
supervision normalize the behavior to a degree, leading to further perpetua￾tion of this destructive form of leadership.220 On the other hand, new leaders 
with a strong moral identity who distance themselves from their supervisors are 
less likely to become abusive and can actually lead more ethically as a result.221
When it comes to the experience of being a victim of abusive supervision, your 
personality and coping strategies matter. Conscientious, resilient, self-regulating 
employees tend to be able to cope with the abuse better.222 Furthermore, appli￾cations of followership theory focus on how followers can confront supervisor 
abuse to break the cycle. For instance, followers can manage the balance of 
power in the relationship to demonstrate to the supervisor that they are instru￾mental to their goals and vision.223 But the onus should not entirely be on the 
abused to improve the situation—the primary responsibility lies in the leader. 
Thankfully, recent research suggests that leaders can be trained to support and 
avoid abusing their subordinates.224 Abusive leaders often show guilt, shame, 
and sometimes lowered self-evaluations, which lead them to paradoxically per￾form constructive leader behaviors following episodes of abuse.225 This does 
reduce the negative sting of abuse to some degree for followers, as long as these 
responses are authentic and not “two-faced.”226

Leadership and Trust
In each of the theories we have discussed, you can see opportunities for 
the practice of good, bad, or mediocre leadership. Now let us think about 
the intentional development of trust that results from positive leadership 
approaches.
Trust
Trust is a psychological state of mutual positive expectations between people—
both depend on each other and are genuinely concerned for each other’s wel￾fare.227 Although you are not completely in control of the situation and some￾times under time pressure which forces you to trust another,228 you are willing 
to take a chance that the other person will come through for you. Trust can 
be focused on competence (e.g., faith in the leaders’ technical skills, experience, 
etc.) or integrity (e.g., faith in a leaders’ motives, honesty, and character). So 
naturally, integrity-based trust is much more effective at reducing the costs asso￾ciated with building new relationships (at least for establishing business connec￾tions between organizations).229
Trust is a primary attribute associated with leadership; breaking it can have 
serious adverse effects on a group’s performance.230 Followers who trust a leader 
are confident their rights and interests will not be abused.231 Transformational 
leaders, for example, create support for their ideas in part by arguing that their 
direction will be in everyone’s best interests. Leaders who trust their followers are 
confident that they will follow through and complete their duties effectively.232
Felt trust matters as well—when the leader feels trusted and the followers trust 
the leader, leaders are more effective.233 Furthermore, followers who feel trusted 
by their leaders become more engaged in their work because they feel they have 
been granted autonomy by their supervisors and because they feel heightened 
LMX perceptions.234
The Outcomes of Trust Trust between supervisors and employees has several 
specific advantages. Here are just a few from research:
• Trust encourages taking risks. Whenever leaders and employees decide to 
deviate from the usual way of doing things, or to take their supervisor’s 
word on a new direction, they are taking a risk. In both cases, a trusting 
relationship can facilitate that leap.235
• Trust facilitates information sharing. One big reason employees fail to ex￾press concerns at work is that they do not feel psychologically safe reveal￾ing their views. When managers demonstrate that they will give employees’ 
ideas a fair hearing and actively make changes, employees are more will￾ing to speak out.236
• Trusting groups are more effective. When a leader sets a trusting tone 
in a group, members are more willing to help each other and exert 
extra effort, which increases trust. Members of mistrusting groups 
tend to be suspicious of each other, constantly guard against exploi￾tation, and restrict communication with others in the group. These 
actions tend to undermine and can eventually destroy the group.237
• Trust enhances productivity. The bottom-line interest of companies appears 
to be positively influenced by trust. Employees who trust their supervisors 
tend to receive higher performance ratings, indicating higher productiv￾ity. People respond to mistrust by concealing information and secretly 
pursuing their own interests. 238

Trust Development What key characteristics lead us to believe a leader is trust￾worthy? Evidence has identified three: integrity, benevolence, and ability (see 
Exhibit 12-7).239
Integrity refers to honesty and truthfulness. When 570 white-collar employees 
were given a list of twenty-eight attributes related to leadership, they rated hon￾esty the most important by far.240 Integrity also means maintaining consistency 
between what you do and say (e.g., authenticity).
Benevolence means the trusted person has your interests at heart, even if your 
interests are not necessarily in line with their interests. Caring and supportive 
behavior is part of the emotional bond between leaders and followers.
Ability encompasses an individual’s technical and interpersonal knowledge 
and skills. You are unlikely to depend on someone whose abilities you do not 
believe in even if the person is highly principled and has the best intentions.
Trust Propensity Trust propensity refers to how likely an employee is to trust a 
leader. Some people are simply more likely to believe others can be trusted.241
Trust propensity is closely linked to the personality trait of agreeableness, and 
people with lower self-esteem are less likely to trust others.242 When teams are 
composed of members with different propensities to trust leaders or other team 
members, they are more prone to spiral downwardly when conflict arises.243
Certainty matters as well—when employees are certain that a leader is trustwor￾thy (e.g., the leader has everything to lose by being untrustworthy) they have a 
higher propensity to trust that leader.244
Trust and Culture Does trust look the same in every culture? In the work context, 
trust in an employment relationship may be built on very different perceptions 
from culture to culture. For example, a study in Taiwan indicated that employ￾ees responded to paternalistic leadership when it is benevolent and ethical 
with increased trust.245 This positive response to paternalism may be unique 
to the collectivistic context (see the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion 
in organizations) where the Confucian values of hierarchy and relationship 
predominate. In individualistic societies, we might expect that paternalistic 
leadership will rankle many employees who prefer to see themselves more as 
individuals. Employees in individualist cultures may build trust along dimen￾sions of leadership support and consistency instead, for instance.
The Role of Time in Trust We come to trust people by observing their behav￾ior over a period of time, such as when you are developing new relationships

with people when you start a new job.246 For example, employees in newly 
acquired companies develop trust toward top managers in the acquiring 
company (especially when they institute fair procedures and when they 
are seen as competent).247 To help, leaders need to demonstrate integrity, 
benevolence, and ability in situations where trust is important—say, where 
they could behave opportunistically or let employees down. Second, trust can 
be maintained by owning up to and apologizing for, not denying, making 
legitimate mistakes.248 Third, research with one hundred companies around 
the world suggested that leaders can build trust by shifting their communica￾tion style from top-down commands to ongoing organizational dialogue.249
Fourth, when leaders regularly create interpersonal conversations with their 
employees that are intimate, interactive, and inclusive, followers demonstrate 
trust with high levels of engagement.250 Finally, followers can experience a 
breach of trust when leaders suddenly replace transformational leadership 
with laissez-faire leadership or when followers witness leaders’ unethical 
behavior—this breach of trust can cause followers to rate leaders as less effec￾tive as a result.251
Regaining Trust Managers who break the psychological contract with workers, 
demonstrating they are not trustworthy leaders, will find employees are less sat￾isfied and less committed, have a higher intention to leave the organization, 
engage in less OCB, and have lower levels of task performance.252
Once it has been violated, trust can be regained through long-term and short￾term strategies,253 but only in certain situations and depending on the type of vio￾lation.254 If the cause is lack of ability, it is usually best to apologize and recognize 
you should have done better. When lack of integrity is the problem, apologies do 
not do much good. Regardless of the violation, saying nothing or refusing to con￾firm or deny guilt is never an effective strategy for regaining trust.255
Trust can be restored when we observe a consistent pattern of trustwor￾thy behavior by the transgressor, although time is of the essence when issu￾ing an apology: Quicker apologies tend to be better than those that come 
late.256 However, if the transgressor used deception, trust never fully returns, 
not even after apologies, promises, or a consistent pattern of trustworthy 
actions.257
Challenges and Opportunities 
to Our Understanding of Leadership
Leaders bear a huge weight of responsibility in modern organizations. Although 
we have talked a great extent about how leaders emerge and guide their groups 
to accomplish great things, leaders, at the heart of it, are still people. As one 
expert leadership consultant noted during COVID-19, many leaders fell victim to 
“superhero syndrome.” These leaders tried to put on a brave face for followers, 
projecting strength and expertise. However, these leaders often encountered 
rapid changes that were too fast for them to handle, and they often compen￾sated by working unreasonably long hours. On the other hand, leaders who 
did not fall victim to superhero syndrome had the confidence to admit and 
recognize that conditions were changing rapidly and they did not have all of the 
answers to the problems that would arise.258 Much of an organization’s success 
or failure is due to factors outside the influence of leadership. Moreover, leaders 
themselves are not perfect. Glorifying leadership while not recognizing that the 
practice of leadership is incredibly “messy,” with multiple variables and moving 
parts, may be an inaccurate representation of the reality of organizational life.

and opportunities to 
our understanding of 
leadership.

Leadership Challenges
In this section, we present challenges to the accepted beliefs about the value of 
leadership.
Leadership as an Attribution As you may remember from the chapter on 
perception and decision making, attribution theory examines how people 
try to make sense of cause-and-effect relationships. The attribution theory of 
leadership says that leadership is merely an attribution people make about 
other individuals.259 For example, we attribute the following to leaders: 
intelligence, outgoing personalities, strong verbal skills, aggressiveness, 
understanding, industriousness, and so on.260 We also, in our day-to-day 
interactions with our leaders, tend to make attributions toward our relation￾ships (e.g., my supervisors gave me a terrible performance appraisal because 
they hate me).261 At the organizational level, we tend, rightly or wrongly, to 
see leaders as responsible for both extremely negative and extremely positive 
performance.262 Attribution theory suggests effective leadership is perhaps 
more perception than reality. Therefore, what value is there in leadership if it 
lies in the eye of the beholder?
Perceptions of leaders by their followers strongly affect leaders’ ability to be 
effective. Employee perceptions of leaders’ behaviors are significant predictors 
of whether they blame their leaders for failure, regardless of how their leaders 
assess themselves.263 Second, a study of more than three thousand employees 
worldwide found people who tended to “romanticize” leadership in general 
were more likely to believe their own leaders were transformational, regardless 
of whether they were really transformational.264
We also make demographic assumptions about leaders. Respondents in 
a U.S. study assumed a leader described with no identifying racial informa￾tion was White at a rate beyond the base rate of White employees in that com￾pany, regardless of respondents’ race.265 When identical leadership situations 
are described but the leaders’ race is manipulated in the description, these 
described leaders (who respondents believed to be White) were rated as more 
effective.266 One large-scale summary found that many individuals hold ste￾reotypes of men as having more leader characteristics than women, although, 
as you might expect, this tendency to equate leadership with masculinity has 
decreased over time.267 Other data suggest women’s perceived success as trans￾formational leaders may be based on situations. These differences in race and 
ethnicity-based leadership attributions may be one mechanism behind leader￾ship under-emergence for women and employees from ethnically diverse back￾grounds, as can be seen in the OB Poll.
Attribution theory suggests that what is important is projecting the appearance
of being a leader rather than focusing on actual accomplishments. Leader￾wannabes who can shape the perception that they are smart, personable, verbally 
adept, aggressive, hardworking, and consistent in their style can increase the 
probability that their supervisors, colleagues, and employees will view them as 
effective leaders. It works both ways as well—coworkers and leaders alike can 
see a follower engaging in OCB toward the leader as being ingratiating or 
“sucking up.”268 Similarly, attributions that suggest the leader was only acting 
fairly for non-benevolent motives (e.g., desiring to exercise control or maintain 
their image) do not influence trust in the leader like a more benevolent motive 
would.269 Even more worrisome, attributions can greatly affect our perception 
of (un)ethical leadership, leading followers to attribute different motives to 
leader unethical behavior (affecting how they react to it),270 and also influence 
how leaders respond to followers’ unethical behavior (e.g., punishing and blam￾ing the victims while excusing favorites).271

is merely an attribution that people make 
about other individuals.

Neutralizers of and Substitutes for Leadership One theory of leadership suggests 
that, in many situations, leaders’ actions are irrelevant. 272 Neutralizers , such as 
indifference to rewards, make it impossible for leader behavior to make any dif￾ference to follower outcomes (see Exhibit 12- 8 ). On the other hand, experience 
and training are among the substitutes that can replace the need for a leader’s 
support or ability to create structure. Organizations such as video game producer 
Valve Corporation, W. L. Gore, and collaboration-software firm GitHub have 
experimented with eliminating leaders and management. Governance in the 
“leaderless” work environment is achieved through accountability to coworkers, 
who determine team composition and sometimes even pay. 273 Organizational 
characteristics such as explicit formalized goals, rigid rules and procedures, and 
cohesive work groups can replace formal leadership. At the same time, leader￾ship can also substitute for the effects of policies, practices, and procedures. For 
example, ethical leadership can substitute for actual justice enactment, such 
that perceiving your leader as ethical matters more to you than them actually 
enacting and enforcing justice. 274
 Sometimes the difference between substitutes and neutralizers is fuzzy. If 
I am working on a task that is intrinsically enjoyable, theory predicts leader￾ship will be less important because the task provides motivation. But does that 
mean intrinsically enjoyable tasks neutralize leadership effects, substitute for 
them, or both? Another problem is that, while substitutes for leadership (such 
as employee characteristics, the nature of the task, etc.) matter to performance, 
that does not necessarily mean leadership is without consequence. 275 It is sim￾plistic to think employees are guided to goal accomplishments solely by the 
actions of their leaders. We have introduced several variables—such as attitudes,

and training, that can replace the need for a

personality, ability, and group norms—that affect employee performance and 
satisfaction. Leadership is simply another aspect of our overall OB model.
Leadership Opportunities
Despite the challenges that confront our understanding of leadership, at the 
same time, there are a number of opportunities for managers to apply what we 
know from OB to identify, develop, and leverage leadership in organizations.
Identifying and Selecting Leaders Because nothing lasts forever, the most 
important event an organization needs to plan for is a change in leadership. 
Sometimes, when organizations do not plan for leadership changes, they may 
not make the best leader appointments or may otherwise spin their wheels with 
an ineffective interim leader.276 JCPenney hired a CEO with no department 
store experience who promptly changed its overall strategy, a maneuver so disas￾trous that JCPenney’s stock fell 69 percent in the roughly one year he lasted 
(after which JCPenney rehired the old CEO it had forced out and he stayed 
until the company returned to a better standing). After that debacle, JCPenney 
seemed to learn its lesson by hiring Marvin Ellison, an executive from Home 
Depot who also had 15 years of experience at Target. The company’s press 
release repeatedly described Ellison as “a highly-accomplished retail executive 
[with] an extensive knowledge of store operations.” However, ultimately, Ellison 
jumped ship, and JCPenney declared bankruptcy following several years with 
another well-qualified CEO and was acquired by Simon Property. 277 Clearly, 
one bad leadership appointment can spell ultimate disaster for a company.
The process organizations go through to fill management positions is an 
exercise in the identification of effective leaders. You might begin by reviewing 
the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to do the job effectively.278 Research 
suggests that the competencies needed for leaders at various levels differs by 
level.279 Executive leaders need conceptual, problem-solving, social, and stra￾tegic skills. Middle managers benefit from interpersonal, social judgment, and 
people skills. Supervisory leaders, depending on the position, can benefit from 
the same skills as middle managers but also from technical skills and knowledge. 
Personality tests can identify traits associated with leadership—extroversion,

conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Broad experience is a poor 
predictor of leader effectiveness (although boards tend to overly rely on track 
record), 280 but situation-specific experience is relevant. 
Training and Developing Leaders Organizations spend billions of dollars on lead￾ership training and development. 281 These efforts take many forms, from expen￾sive executive leadership programs offered by universities such as Harvard to 
quick, just-in-time smartphone leadership training through mindgym. How can 
managers get the most from their leadership-training budgets? 282 First, the key 
is to conducting a good needs analysis. Organizations need to ask themselves, 
“What are our current staffing needs?” and “What is our current leadership tal￾ent pool like?” From there, they have a better idea of what their leadership train￾ing needs are. Furthermore, organizations need to explicitly identify what they 
are looking to develop in leaders. For instance, organizations can teach critical 
interpersonal skills if these are necessary or cross-cultural communication skills 
for leaders aspiring toward positions that involve intercultural contact. After the 
design and delivery of training (from either an outside vendor or internally devel￾oped program), organizations should determine whether the training transferred
to the new environment. Did the trained leader actually put into practice what 
they learned? If not, did they have an opportunity to demonstrate the new skill, 
or were they motivated to demonstrate it? Leaders should make it a habit to regu￾larly review their leadership after key organizational events as part of their devel￾opment. 283 After identifying and “grooming” leaders and determining whether 
they have developed the requisite skills, these accomplishments can be consid￾ered in determining which leaders should be promoted, retained in their current 
positions, or (in the case of poor performance) demoted or transferred laterally. 
Another option is coaching. Between 25 and 40 percent of Fortune 500 compa￾nies have hired coaches to help top executives improve their leadership skills, 
reporting an average return of about $100,000 per investment. 284 These would 
work similarly to a formal training program but would more closely resemble a 
mentorship relationship (as described in the next section). 
 Myth or Science? Leaders Can Be Trained 
 U.S. companies spent $82.5 bil￾lion on workplace training in 
2020. Estimates suggest that 
executives budget the majority of funds 
in organizational training for leadership 
development. The question is, are they 
getting a good return on investment? 
 Evidence from meta-analyses sug￾gests that individuals’ leadership 
behaviors, skills, and styles are essen￾tial predictors of employees’ productiv￾ity and satisfaction, team performance, 
and overall organizational perfor￾mance. However, popular press articles 
often imply that training programs are 
minimally effective at developing these 
leadership skills. Instead, there is the 
familiar notion that “managers are cre￾ated, leaders are born.” On the other 
hand, the research literature presents 
more optimistic findings. The research 
demonstrates that people can learn 
from leadership training programs, 
apply what they learn to the workplace, 
and enjoy enhanced performance as a 
result. 
 Nonetheless, not all leadership 
training programs are created equal. 
Studies have found that programs 
developed using a needs analysis (i.e., 
determining the exact kinds of lead￾ership skills needed) result in more 
significant learning and transfer of 
skills to the workplace. Furthermore, 
evidence suggests that mandatory 
programs are better at achieving 
organizational outcomes than volun￾tary programs. Moreover, programs 
that allow employees to practice what 
they learned are more effective than 
those that merely present information 
on what it means to be a successful 
leader. Thus, while the evidence is 
clear that training can build leadership 
skills, organizations should purpose￾fully design these programs based on 
best practices if they hope for a return 
on their investment. 285
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 430 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 431
Leaders as Mentors Leaders often take responsibility for developing future lead￾ers. A mentor is a senior employee who sponsors and supports a less-experienced 
employee, a protégé.286 Mentoring relationships serve career and psychosocial 
functions (see Exhibit 12-9).287 Successful mentors build a personal relationship 
with protégés that is characterized by mutual trust, instill accountability and 
build confidence and adaptability in protégés, and seek to improve protégés’ 
competence and career progression (e.g., through networking).288
In formal mentoring relationships, protégé candidates are identified accord￾ing to assessments of leadership potential and then matched with leaders in cor￾responding organizational functions. Informal mentoring relationships develop 
when leaders identify a less-experienced, lower-level employee who appears to 
have potential for future development.289 The protégé is often tested with a 
particularly challenging assignment. If performance is acceptable, the mentor 
develops the relationship. In both formal and informal mentoring, the goal is to 
show the protégé how the organization really works outside its formal structures 
and procedures.
Are all employees in an organization likely to participate in a mentoring 
relationship? Unfortunately, no.290 However, research continues to indicate 
that employers should establish mentoring programs because they benefit 
both mentors and protégés,291 although informal arrangements tend to work 
better.292 Furthermore, there are some gender differences in that males tend to 
be more likely to serve as a mentor, while females tend to both give and receive 
more psychosocial support in a mentoring relationship.293 You might assume 
that mentoring is valuable for objective outcomes like compensation and job 
performance, but research suggests the gains are primarily psychological.294
Thus, while mentoring can have an impact on career success, it is not as much 
of a contributing factor.

Summary
Leadership is central to OB because leaders play a vital role: influencing the 
group, team, unit, or organization to realize their vision. Although not every￾one has to be a leader, understanding what it takes to be a good leader (and a 
good follower) can help improve interpersonal dynamics in the workplace. This 
is especially true when coordination is critical, such as during times of crisis. 
There are several approaches that OB theorists, researchers, and practitioners 
have introduced to make sense of this leadership puzzle. First, the trait theories 
suggest that personality traits and individual differences (e.g., the Big Five, pro￾active personality, the Dark Triad, emotional intelligence) all have implications 
for leadership, although they primarily matter most for predicting who emerges 
as or becomes a leader. Second, behavioral theories focus mainly on what leaders 
do, primarily uncovering two behaviors that matter for leader success: initiating 
structure and consideration. Third, the contingency theories suggest the best 
leadership characteristics, styles, or approaches depend (or are contingent) on the 
situation or context. Modern followership theories (e.g., shared leadership theory 
and followership theory) suggest that the followers themselves serve as the most 
critical contingency. Fourth, modern leadership theories point to the positive 
ways that leaders make a difference on followers, focusing on how leaders inspire 
followers to band together toward a shared vision. Charismatic and transforma￾tional leadership can be powerful motivational leader forces. In contrast, trans￾actional approaches form a managerial foundation that establishes a structure 
for followers. Finally, being a leader inevitably involves making ethically charged 
decisions. Therefore, they face decisions regarding how to present themselves 
(e.g., authentically) and how to treat their followers (e.g., abusively or develop￾mentally) and in determining the example they want to set through their actions 
(e.g., ethically or unethically). Together, these modern leadership approaches 
forge a fulfilling relationship between leader and follower, or a leader–member 
exchange characterized by mutual trust. Although leadership is undoubtedly a 
“messy” subject in organizations, wrought with many challenges, it also presents 
many opportunities to accomplish great things.
Implications for Managers
● Although extroverted people are more likely to be hired or promoted 
into leadership positions, extroversion does not necessarily predict more 
effective leadership. Instead, try to focus on how the person leads and 
their leadership skills.
● As a leader, the worst thing that you can probably do is to do nothing. 
Although there may be times when inaction is necessary, it may spell disas￾ter if it is your default style.
● When it comes to leadership, there may very well be no one-size-fits-all 
approach. When deciding how to act as a leader, consider the situation 
and context first (e.g., the culture, the climate, the follower base) and 
decide which approach may be most appropriate. Moreover, consider 
the outcomes and side effects of the approaches you choose and work 
pre-emptively to address them.
● Out of all the behavior leaders engage in, two are the most important: ini￾tiating structure and consideration. Depending upon the situation, lead￾ership problems require some degree of both to be solved.
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 432 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 433
● Leadership should be built on a solid foundation of managerial and trans￾actional leadership, which sets the structure for the goals to be accom￾plished to realize the vision.
● Charismatic and transformational leadership can be practical tools for in￾spiring and motivating followers to do great things and build high-quality 
relationships with followers. However, they can also be used for unethical 
purposes, which should be avoided.
● Understand the ethical context and issues surrounding the leadership 
problems you are charged with addressing. Strive to act authentically, ethi￾cally, and in a way that serves your followers.
● Understand the negative consequences of destructive and abusive leader￾ship. Regulate your emotions and your actions to avoid this type of behav￾ior. If you do act abusively, own up to your misbehavior and work with the 
victim constructively to move forward and ensure that it does not happen 
again.
● When establishing relationships with followers, try not to “play favorites.” 
Although it may not be possible to develop high-quality exchange rela￾tionships with all your followers, try to treat everyone fairly and support￾ively, and base any recognition and resources given out on performance 
and skill, not friendship or how much you like them.
● Trust is a critical component of the leader–follower relationship. Not only 
is it important to feel trusted by your followers (and to know that they 
trust you), but it is also vital for your followers to know that you trust them. 
Work toward building trust over time, and when trust is broken, quickly 
own up to it. Also, know that trust is challenging to rebuild after an ethical 
violation (e.g., deception) and may never fully recover.
● Certain aspects of the organization (e.g., its culture, climate, structure) 
can sometimes neutralize the effects of leadership. Moreover, other as￾pects of the organization may “fill in” or “substitute” for the absence of 
leadership. Try to recognize if this is happening and get a sense of the 
effect that it is having. There could be a missed opportunity to improve 
processes by enhancing leadership.
● Many contend that leadership is all about perception. People can behave 
in ways that make them “appear” like leaders. Otherwise, influential peo￾ple may be passed up for a leadership position or promotion because they 
do not “come off” as leaders. Try to be mindful of your own leadership bi￾ases and use objective criteria as much as possible when making decisions, 
especially those involving identifying leaders.
● Consider evidence-based leadership selection, training and development, 
and mentoring programs to leverage the power of leadership in your 
organization.

POINT 
 CEOs Start Early 
I
f you really get down to specifics, you can see that CEOs start 
in leadership roles early in life. They have similar backgrounds, 
childhood challenges, and coping strategies. In fact, it is easy 
to see a CEO-in-the-making at your neighborhood lemonade stand. 
 What is the profile of burgeoning CEOs? It starts with their parents, 
who are almost all successful through industriousness. For example, 
Linda Zecher, the former CEO of publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 
grew up in a household in which her father ran several businesses. 
Brent Frei, CEO of software company Smartsheet.com , grew up on 
an 800-acre farm that his father owned and operated. Aspera CEO 
Michelle Munson’s mother was a professor, and her father was the 
fifth-generation leader of her farm. 
 Second, future CEOs are raised with responsibilities. Susan Story, 
CEO of utility company American Water, learned as a child that “no 
matter how bad things get, it’s about working hard and taking per￾sonal responsibility, because nobody owes you anything.” Frei “had 
an opportunity to do big things early on. When I was 6 years old, my 
dad . . . put me in the pickup, put it in first gear, and I drove it home 
with my 5-year-old sister in the passenger seat.” Many CEOs grow up 
working on family farms or taking care of their siblings. 
 Third, burgeoning CEOs are successful leaders when they are 
young. Ruth Rathblott, CEO of Harlem Educational Activities Fund, was 
president of her seventh-grade class and then president of the middle 
school; Brad Jefferson, CEO of video slide show service Animoto, was 
the high school quarterback, captain of the football team, and se￾nior class president; and Hannah Paramore, founder of digital agency 
Paramore, “was always the one in charge. I was always captain of this 
and captain of that.” 
 Clearly, CEOs start early. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 C
EOs who start early have good stories to tell when they become 
successful, but that does not necessarily mean they represent 
the majority. Let’s look at a few other aspects of the tender 
years of CEOs. 
 First, we know that much of our personality is attributable to ge￾netics, but it is incorrect to infer that we can (1) map the genetic trail 
for a personality trait from ancestors to CEO or (2) tell where a young 
person’s traits will lead. Likewise, we cannot say that if the parents 
are successful through industriousness, their children will be. Story’s 
parents worked in a cotton mill and a wastewater plant, and they 
“didn’t have a lot of money.” Frei’s family farm “was a little bit below 
the threshold for break-even.” Mitch Rothschild, CEO of website Vitals, 
observed, “Parents influence you either because you want to be like 
them or because you want to not be like them.” 
 Second, what child is raised without responsibilities? None, even 
if all they have to do is go to school. There are plenty of CEOs who had 
a lot of responsibilities growing up, and others who did not. Munson’s 
parents “emphasized two things. One was education, and the other 
was participating in 4-H.” Zecher “had a paper route. [She] was a 
girl scout, and [she] was involved in a lot of clubs and sports in high 
school.” 
 Third, it would be a mistake to conclude that CEOs start as young 
leaders. The ones who do simply do not talk about it. Ron Kaplan, CEO 
of manufacturer Trex, was a marksmanship competitor. Zecher did not 
have a plan or a leadership role until after college. 
 The stories of CEOs who start early make for good press reports, 
but CEOs do not by definition start early. What we can say, though, is 
that genetics and experiences both shape young people, and that the 
relationship between those factors and CEO success is complex. 295

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
Understanding how leaders emerge, what makes leaders 
effective, and leading and influencing people to pursue 
a vision and achieve organizational goals are invaluable 
skills. These skills will help you become more employable 
and perhaps improve your chances of being promoted in 
your job. This information is also vital for knowing how 
to interact and communicate effectively with your man￾ager or supervisor. From this chapter, we know leadership 
is a multifaceted concept: Our personality traits can af￾fect whether we become leaders (and if we will tend to be 
good at it). This may be important when you are in a posi￾tion where you have a say in appointing a leader to your 
team or department. You should now have a better idea 
about what leaders do and how situations constrain them. 
You also know how vital the leader–follower relationship 
is to effective leadership and how charisma, authenticity, 
ethicality, and transformational leadership styles tend to 
be very effective. Clearly, you can see that being a leader 
and being a manager are two separate things. By inspiring 
and challenging your subordinates, you build trust and 
develop them so that they grow as employees and help 
the organization achieve its goals. In this chapter, you im￾proved your critical thinking, creativity, and leadership 
skills by finding out that effective leadership training and 
development is not a myth, by learning how leadership 
can be leveraged to make the world a better place, evalu￾ating the ethics of nudging behaviors, and questioning 
whether CEOs take on leadership roles early in life. In 
the following section, you will continue to develop these 
skills, along with your self- and career management skills, 
by identifying examples of leaders from multiple different 
contexts, considering the ethical obligations of CEOs to 
their employees when CEOs consider leaving, and analyz￾ing the effectiveness of shared leadership.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE What’s in a Leader?
Break the class into (or allow the class to volunteer to 
join) one of the following five groups:
GROUP A: Government leaders (president, senator, gov￾ernor, representative, assemblyperson)
GROUP B: Business leaders (CEO, president, leader in 
business)
GROUP C: University leaders (university president, pro￾vost, dean, professor)
GROUP D: Sports leaders (coach, informal team leader, 
team captain)
GROUP E: Social/thought leaders (activists, whistle￾blowers, authors)
Questions
12-8. Each group selects one leader from popular culture 
or history to serve as an appropriate example for 
the group. The group discusses that person, iden￾tifying the defining characteristics or traits of the 
leader, not simply by brainstorming but by draw￾ing on examples that most of the group members 
agree are defining characteristics of the person.
12-9. Reconvene the class. The instructor will draw on 
the board one column for each of the five groups 
and list the selected person and their character￾istics in each column. For each person selected 
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 435 21/12/22 6:53 AM436 PART 3 The Group
by the groups, decide whether the person’s traits 
or attributions would lead to good or bad leader 
effectiveness for the group’s type of leader. Why 
or why not? What would the results of the oppo￾site or alternative strategies in those contexts be, 
and why? What similarities do you see between 
the lists? From the results of this exercise, does 
it appear that what it takes to be a good leader 
depends on the context? For each context, does 
it appear that what makes for leader emergence 
within the context is different from what makes 
leaders effective?
ETHICAL DILEMMA Innocent, but What About Trust?
Innocent Drinks is a London-based company operating in 
the beverages industry worldwide. The business idea was 
conceived in 1998 by three Cambridge University gradu￾ates, and the company made its début in 1999. The three 
friends led the business idea by having a clear vision, and 
they took personal risks to achieve it. Their goal was to 
produce 100-percent natural smoothies that “do good.” 
The uniqueness of the company’s products and the 
unique leadership style became the brand’s selling point. 
With an inspirational and ethical leadership style, a busi￾ness approach that emphasized social responsibility and 
ethical sources, an employee-led innovation culture, and 
its stated purpose of “doing good,” Innocent established 
a reputation and became successful in the market. Since 
2014, Innocent has thrived in 15 European countries.
Notwithstanding this success, Innocent recorded losses 
in 2008 due to the economic downturn, and in 2009 they 
announced plans to sell 10 percent of the company to 
Coca-Cola. Following this announcement, Innocent expe￾rienced a fall in their Ethiscore from 12.5 to 6.5. In 2013, 
the Coca-Cola Company increased its stake to over 90 per￾cent of Innocent Drinks, leaving very little scope for the 
former leadership of the company to lead the future of 
the brand. Despite the positive strategic implications for 
global expansion and product development (including 
the launch of its coconut water products and Innocent 
Bubble in 2015), debates raged over the trustworthiness 
and the authenticity of its leadership, leading to a simple 
question about the brand: could customers still trust its 
Innocence?296
Questions
12-10. Analyze the charismatic, transformational, and 
transactional elements of Innocent’s leadership 
since the expansion of Coca-Cola’s stake in the 
company.
12-11. What is ethical leadership, and how could it be 
evidenced in Innocent Drinks?
12-12. Why has the authenticity of the ethical leader￾ship of Innocent Drinks come under scrutiny?
CASE INCIDENT Andrea Illy: Leading a Family Company Responsibly
Founded in 1933 in Trieste, Italy, by Francesco Illy, the 
Illycaffè coffee dynasty is led today by the third generation 
of the family, with Chairperson Andrea Illy at its head. 
The firm operates in over 140 countries and has a turn￾over of about €500 million. More than 100,000 retailers 
serve Illy coffee, and the aim is to double that figure by 
2027—but not at any cost. Mr. Illy is a firm believer in re￾sponsible business.
Illy has emerged as one of the most outspoken Italian 
business leaders. He has long espoused a sort of pick-and￾mix version of capitalism, resolutely refusing to focus only 
on sales and profits. However, he rejects the notion his 
style of capitalism is charity, arguing instead that what he 
does is just good business.
This view has been shaped by the coffee sector itself, 
where issues such as sustainability have become a major 
concern. For decades, the company has paid its grow￾ers 30 percent higher than the average market value in 
order to maintain its supply of top Arabica beans. “This 
is not just good for society and workers, but it is good for 
business,” Illy says. “It is about shared values. It builds a 
long-term relationship with growers, which is good for 
customers, because of the quality of the coffee, and for 
our business too.”
“This is about social responsibility,” he insists, “but the 
real one and not the fake one. This is about being a stake￾holder model and not a shareholder one. The business 
leader is always asking people to do things for him, but 
instead he should be asking: ‘What can I do for you?’”
The Illy family is a supporter of arts and culture, includ￾ing Trieste’s annual sailing regatta, the Barcolana, where 
hundreds of boats race in the Gulf of Trieste. Illy says this 
creates a virtuous circle: the more attractive Trieste be￾comes, the more talented people Illy can attract to work 
for the company, and the more visitors come to the city, 
raising its brand profile. 
M12_ROBB0025_19_GE_C12.indd 436 21/12/22 6:53 AMLeadership CHAPTER 12 437
A portrait of his father Ernesto, one of his leader￾ship heroes, hangs opposite his desk. “I put the paint￾ing there to ask him to control what I do,” Illy says. 
But what has Illy learned from his family? “Society is 
made by the private sector, mostly,” he says. “And if 
you want to improve society, then we need to be able to 
pursue long-term goals which are beyond profitability, 
and then you have to be free and accountable only to 
yourself.”297

 EMPIRE OF PAIN 
The Sacklers, the family behind Purdue Pharma (a major pharmaceutical 
company), carefully cultivated an image of philanthropy in the public 
view. Their name was plastered on buildings across the world, from New 
York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Westminster Abbey in London. 
They have amassed a collective net worth of $13 billion, becoming one of 
America’s wealthiest families. Yet many consider members of the Sackler 
family to be personally responsible for causing the opioid epidemic. 
 In 1996, Purdue Pharma began selling a new painkiller, OxyContin, a form 
of the powerful opiate oxycodone, that is twice as potent as morphine. At 
the time, the drug was groundbreaking: The pill’s special coating allowed 
large doses of oxycodone to be slowly released. Purdue Pharma’s power and 
influence continued to grow as it came to dominate the opioid market. More 
and more individuals developed a dependence on these powerful drugs. 
More than twenty years later, Purdue Pharma would be at the center of a 
scandal surrounding its role in the opioid epidemic, with hundreds of people 
dying every day from overdoses. 
 Investigations of the inner workings of Purdue Pharma demonstrated that 
members of the organization utilized a variety of influence tactics to achieve 
its astounding level of success. In fact, the company earned more than $10 
billion in profits. First, the company had to form coalitions with physicians, 
individuals who would be perceived as legitimate. To convince physicians to 
use and promote the drug, Purdue funded research that incorrectly claimed 
M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 439 13/12/22 3:03 AM440 PART 3 The Group
that opioid addiction concerns were exaggerated. At the same time, Purdue 
Pharma showcased to physicians how OxyContin could be used to help treat 
a wide range of medical issues. In exchange for speaker fees, dinners, and 
trips, physicians prescribed Purdue’s opioid products.
Purdue Pharma understood that physicians were heavily influenced by 
their peers. Therefore, Purdue Pharma capitalized on physicians’ networks 
and enlisted prominent doctors to endorse their products and share them 
with fellow doctors. Keith Humphreys, professor of psychiatry at Stanford 
and a former drug-policy advisor to the Obama administration, noted that 
one of the most concerning aspects was how many well-meaning doctors 
were convinced to prescribe OxyContin due to Purdue’s extraordinary level of 
influence. Also, an electronics health record company, Practice Fusion Inc., 
received payments in exchange for referring, recommending, and arranging 
the ordering of Purdue’s products.
An army of sales representatives was also enlisted to realize this massive 
influence operation. Through the “Evolve to Excellence” program, Purdue sales 
representatives heavily marketed OxyContin to high-volume prescribers. These 
physicians were writing twenty-five times as many OxyContin prescriptions as 
other physicians. The result was health care providers prescribing opioids for 
uses that were unsafe and not medically necessary. Purdue also implemented 
a lucrative bonus system that rewarded sales representatives who increased 
OxyContin sales in their territories. Marketing materials used by Purdue Pharma 
demonstrated how they were able to persuade patients to believe that using 
the drug frequently did not mean they had a drug addiction. The materials 
reasoned that patients were using the drugs for medical purposes to relieve 
pain. Therefore, according to the materials, dependency was not a concern. 
Doctors faced even more pressure because of the pay-for-performance systems 
that were in place. Providers were evaluated based on their ability to relieve 
patients’ pain, and the prescription of opioids was a quick solution.
Finally in 2020, Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to three criminal charges, 
officially taking responsibility for its role in the epidemic that contributed to 
hundreds of thousands of deaths. Although the Sackler family has agreed to 
pay $225 million to the federal government to settle civil claims, no criminal 
charges have been filed against the family. While it is still possible for the 
family to face charges in the future, critics contend that this deal overlooks 
that the Sacklers used their power and influence to knowingly generate 
enormous profits while millions of individuals faced the consequences.1
I
n this chapter, we will learn about power, including how a person obtains 
power and the tactics employees use to command or direct others to realize 
their goals. We will also learn the role of political behavior in maintaining 
power within an organization. Power in organizations is a compelling 
M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 440 13/12/22 3:03 AMPower and Politics CHAPTER 13 441
force. Power sets the tone for your company culture, it impacts how people 
communicate in their work groups and teams, it can streamline (or sidetrack) 
collaboration, it influences the flow of information between people, and it can 
affect productivity.2
 We begin by exploring our natural association of power 
with leadership.
Power and Leadership
In organizational behavior (OB), power simply refers to the capacity, discre￾tion, and means to enforce one’s will over others.3
 Someone can thus have 
power but not use it; a powerful person has discretion over when to exercise 
their power. Probably the most important aspect of power is that it is a func￾tion of dependence.
4
 The more people rely or depend upon the powerful 
person (who controls something the others rely on or want), the more power￾ful that person becomes. When people begin to have more alternatives and 
options or begin to rely on themselves or different people, the powerful per￾son loses power.
Unfortunately, we all too often hear about people using their power to 
unethical ends. For example, people depend upon executives, managers, and 
even employee “superstars” (e.g., a partner in a law firm who brings in lucrative 
clients) for promotions, pay raises, or bringing in customers/clientele. These 
powerful leaders are, thus, unjustly empowered to enforce their will over others 
in several ways, including sexual harassment.5
 Sexual harassment is a huge prob￾lem, adversely affecting employees’ mental and physical health and opportuni￾ties for advancement as well as costing organizations millions of dollars in legal 
fees and employee turnover.6
Money is a powerful factor in dependence. For instance, among gig workers, 
many are financially dependent on their clients for work continuity, with 16 per￾cent being financially dependent on one client.7
 The same is true for major 
contractors in the public sector.8
 Often, these employees, leaders, and entire 
organizations depend on a single government contract for business continuity. 
In the case of government shutdowns and furloughs, these contracts are often 
cut or suspended, leaving people temporarily out of work for weeks or even 
months. Financial dependency can also become more salient during times of 
crisis. For instance, more than half of midlife employees surveyed in one study 
(55  percent) indicated that they were worried about their financial situation 
due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.9
A careful comparison of our description of power with our description of 
leadership in the chapter on leadership reveals the concepts are closely inter￾twined. How are the two terms different? Power does not require goal com￾patibility, just dependence. Leadership, on the other hand, requires some 
congruence between the goals of the leader and those being led. A second 
difference relates to the direction of influence. Power focuses more on the 
downward influence on followers. It minimizes the importance of lateral and 
upward relationships, which are important in leadership. For a third differ￾ence, leadership often emphasizes style. It seeks answers to questions such 
as “How supportive should a leader be?” and “How much decision making 
should be shared with followers?” In contrast, power focuses on tactics for 
securing compliance.
You may have noted that, for a power situation to exist, one person or group 
needs to have control over resources that the other person or group values. This 
is usually the case in established leadership situations. However, power relation￾ships are possible in all areas of life, not just leadership positions, and power can 
be obtained in many ways.10 Let us explore the various sources of power next.

to enforce one’s will over others.

M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 441 13/12/22 3:03 AM442 PART 3 The Group
Bases of Power
Where does power come from? We answer this question by dividing the bases 
(or sources) of power into two general groupings—formal and personal—and 
breaking down each into more specific categories.11
Formal Power
Formal power is based on an individual’s position in an organization. It can come 
from the ability to coerce or reward or from legitimate authority.
Coercive Power The coercive power base depends on the target’s fear of negative 
results from failing to comply or acting in a way that would anger the power-holder.12 A 
sales consultant may remain silent after witnessing their supervisor falsify their team’s 
sales numbers for fear of being terminated or demoted, being assigned to undesirable 
regions or clients, and/or being treated in an embarrassing way in front of the rest of 
the team. Even technology can become a conduit for coercive power. For instance, 
call centers might install electronic surveillance systems that automatically assess work￾ers (through machine learning) and compare their progress with predefined targets. 
If workers fail to meet these targets they may be punished or docked.13
Coercive power comes also from withholding key information. People in an 
organization who have data or knowledge others need can make others depen￾dent on them. For example, the sales team leader may have valuable informa￾tion on client leads—anything that might threaten obtaining this information 
may lead the consultant or cause a consultant on the team to comply or acqui￾esce. When subordinates are being abused by supervisors, coercive power is 
often the main force that keeps them from retaliating.14
Reward Power The opposite of coercive power is reward power, which people 
comply with because it produces positive benefits; someone who can distribute 
rewards that others view as valuable can have power over them.15 For instance, 
the sales team lead who rewards compliant team members with lead informa￾tion is exercising reward power. Alternatively, these rewards can be financial—
such as setting pay rates, raises, and bonuses—or nonfinancial, including rec￾ognition, promotions, interesting work assignments, friendly colleagues, and 
preferred work shifts or sales territories. The degree to which a person exercises 
reward power has been traced to several individual differences. For instance, 
research at a large law firm found that political ideology and organizational 
tenure both influenced the uneven allocation of rewards. In other words, older, 
conservative supervisors were more likely to discriminately give rewards to staff 
in such a way that perpetuated gender inequality.16
Legitimate Power The most common way to access one or more of the power 
bases is probably through legitimate power. It represents the formal authority to 
control and use organizational resources based on the person’s structural position 
in the organization. In general, when school principals, bank presidents, or army 
captains speak, teachers, tellers, and first lieutenants usually comply. In fact, many 
people associate power so closely with the concept of hierarchy that just drawing 
longer lines in an organization chart leads them to infer the leaders are especially 
powerful.17
Legitimate power includes members’ acceptance of the authority of a 
hierarchical position.18 Research on nearly 650,000 article-discussion pages 
on Wikipedia found that legitimate power was accepted during fierce source 
conflicts, when the individual was high status (e.g., recognized as a structural 
authority on the topic), and when those taking part in the discussion were less 
coercive power A power base that depends 
on fear of the negative results from failing to 
comply.
reward power Power based on the ability 
to distribute rewards that others view as 
valuable.
legitimate power Power based on a 
person’s position in the formal hierarchy of 
an organization.
13-2 Explain the three bases 
of formal power and the 
two bases of 
personal power.
M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 442 13/12/22 3:03 AMPower and Politics CHAPTER 13 443
experienced.19 Moreover, association with legitimate power may serve as a sig￾nal that the organization’s efforts are worthy of attention and even investment. 
For example, an analysis of high-ranking Chinese government official visits to 
corporate-affiliated worksites (e.g., factories) showed that investors reacted posi￾tively to these visits (via heightened stock market performance).20
Furthermore, legitimate power can also dampen the effect of other forms of 
power. For instance, when an employee stands up against something unethical, 
they are less likely to suffer the consequences of others’ coercive power (e.g., sanc￾tioning, ostracism, etc.) when they, themselves, are high in legitimate power.21
Personal Power
Many people can have power, even if they are not managers and if they have no 
formal power. What they have is personal power, which comes from an individu￾al’s unique characteristics.22 There are two bases of personal power: expertise 
and the respect and admiration of others. Some people (e.g., a sales consultant) 
might only have personal power, but others can also have formal power. For 
example, a sales consultant lead not only may have formal power bases but can 
also be well liked and respected.
Expert Power Expert power is based on expertise, special skills, or knowledge.23
As jobs become more specialized, we become dependent on experts to achieve 
goals. It is generally acknowledged that physicians have expertise and hence 
expert power: Most of us follow our doctor’s advice. Returning to our sales con￾sultant example, some of the team members may wield expert power due to 
their strong sales skills or expertise in the area.
Ironically, expert power can occasionally have a detrimental effect 
on knowledge worker team performance. For instance, in times of turbulence, 
knowledge worker teams that rely too much on experts who have “entrenched” 
knowledge or perspectives on the problem (e.g., they have not kept up with 
all of the advancements despite being experts) can actually hurt innovation.24
Moreover, experts may be more likely to ignore others’ advice and not take their 
feedback into account, especially when they see their contributions less as a 
responsibility to others and more as an opportunity.25

M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 443 13/12/22 3:03 AM444 PART 3 The Group
Referent Power Referent power is based on identification with a person who has 
desirable resources or personal traits.26 If I like, respect, and admire you, you 
can exercise power over me because I want to please you. Some people who are 
not in formal leadership positions have referent power and exert influence over 
others because of their charismatic dynamism, likability, and emotional appeal.27
Referent power develops out of admiration of another and a desire to be like 
that person. It helps explain, for instance, why celebrities are paid millions of 
dollars to endorse products in commercials. Marketing research shows people 
such as Michelle Wie, LeBron James, and Cristiano Ronaldo have the power to 
influence your choice of athletic shoes and credit cards.28 With a little practice, 
you could probably deliver as smooth a sales pitch as these celebrities. Indeed, 
the wild effectiveness of influencer marketing, a $10 billion-plus business, provides 
evidence of this phenomenon as aided by the wide adoption of social media.29
As one Forbes contributor wrote: “Influencers are the new celebrity endorse￾ments”30—and there might be something to this.31 Data from one company 
found that 92  percent of consumers trust an influencer endorsement more 
than they would a celebrity endorsement.32 This has led a number of companies 
such as Procter & Gamble and Cisco to recruit and hire employees considered 
to be "influencers" by their peers.33
Which Bases of Power Are Most Effective?
Of the bases of power, which are most effective? This is a complicated question. 
Regarding the dependents in the power relationship, different bases of power 
are effective depending upon the perceptions and characteristics of the depen￾dent. For example, dependents view angry leaders as higher on formal power, 
and in turn are more loyal toward these leaders and perceive them as more 
effective.34 On the other hand, dependents are likely to perceive coercive and 
low-referent leaders as ineffective, become less loyal toward these leaders, and 
even engage in deviant behaviors directed at these leaders.
It does appear though, that referent power can be an especially powerful motiva￾tor. Consider Steve Stoute’s company, Translation, which matches pop-star spokes￾people with corporations that want to promote their brands. Stoute has paired Justin 
Timberlake with McDonald’s, Mary J. Blige with Apple Music, and several famous 
rappers with shoe companies (e.g., Jay-Z and 50 Cent).35 Translation’s approach 
has changed with the times as well. As more frequent content is needed in today’s 
day and age, Translation has worked on creating an online mini-series to promote 
products and organizations and to discuss culture that has reached 42.5 million 
people. Partnering with Dr. Dre (Beats by Dre), Translation created “The Shop,” 
a series where NBA all-stars (e.g., Kevin Durant, LeBron James) and hip-hop artists 
(e.g., Future) alike, all with large bases of referent power, discuss several topics (e.g., 
sneakers, music, the game, etc.) amid a barbershop backdrop.36
Dependence: The Key to Power
The most important aspect of power is that it is a function of dependence. In 
this section, we show how understanding dependence helps us understand the 
degrees of power.
The General Dependence Postulate
Let us begin with a general postulate: The greater B’s dependence on A, the more 
power A has over B. When you possess anything others require that you alone con￾trol, they can become dependent on you and, therefore, you may gain power 
over them.37 For instance, many entrepreneurial CEOs are often unwilling to 
referent power Influence based on 
identification with a person who has 
desirable resources or personal traits.

take the advice of their board members when it means giving up a semblance 
of power and control over the company.38 But if something is plentiful, possess￾ing it will not increase your power. Therefore, the more you can expand your 
own options, the less power you place in the hands of others. This explains why 
most organizations develop multiple suppliers rather than give their business 
to only one.
What Creates Dependence?
Dependence increases when the resource you control is important, scarce, and 
nonsubstitutable.39
Importance If nobody wants what you have, it is not going to create depen￾dence. Note, however, that there are many degrees of importance, from need￾ing the resource for survival to wanting a resource that is in fashion, adds to 
convenience, or is of relational importance. This is why organizations should 
entrust multiple people to build relationships with clients and suppliers instead 
of just one. If that one person were to leave, it could very well spell the end of 
the business relationship if the client could easily go elsewhere.40
Scarcity When the supply of labor is low relative to demand, workers can negotiate 
compensation and benefits packages far more attractive than those in occupations 
with an abundance of candidates. For example, the number of professional photog￾raphers in the United States is steadily increasing and expected to grow by 7 percent 
by 2026. However, it is relatively easy for organizations to find photographers, with 
many actually cutting salaried photographers in favor of the occasional contract 
photographer.41 In contrast, the market for medical professionals (e.g., physician 
assistants, registered nurses, and medical technologists) is comparatively tight, with 
demand high and supply limited. The resulting bargaining power of these medical 
professionals has led them to enjoy higher pay and more job security.42
Nonsubstitutability The fewer viable substitutes for a resource, the more power 
a person controlling that resource has. For decades, Steinway was the piano of 
choice for musicians.43 As Arthur Rubinstein, one of the greatest pianists of the 
Scientist Maria Kovalenko is in a 
position of power at Gilead Sciences, 
a research-based biopharmaceutical 
firm. Scientists are in a powerful oc￾cupational group at Gilead because 
they discover and develop medicines 
that improve the lives of patients 
and contribute to Gilead’s growth and 
success.

20th century, wrote: “A Steinway is a Steinway, and there is nothing like it in the 
world.”44 However, Steinway lost much of its power and hold over the piano mar￾ket during the last half century.45 Yamaha, a major competitor, was able to lever￾age mass manufacturing, automated processes, and technology to build pianos 
of consistent quality. The more organically crafted Steinways, on the other hand, 
had many musicians commenting that each one had its own unique sound, 
which made it difficult to adapt and adjust to different concert halls.46 In essence, 
Yamaha was able to leapfrog Steinway, stripping it of its nonsubstitutability.
As a major nonsubstitutability issue confronting the modern workforce, 
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought economic and philo￾sophical issues of labor to the forefront. For example, employees with skilled 
trades are at risk for losing power as their skills become more efficiently and 
automatically handled by robotics: In other words, their skills are becoming “sub￾stitutable.” Despite this fear, some economists and theorists suggest that new jobs 
are created as the need arises for labor that requires nonsubstitutable abilities, 
and we are merely enhancing productivity and making work easier through AI.47
Formal Small-Group Networks
Formal organizational networks can be complicated, including hundreds of peo￾ple and a half dozen or more hierarchical levels.48 However, they have substan￾tial implications for power and influence in organizations, as information flows 
through networks.49 We have condensed these networks into three common small 
groups of five people each (see Exhibit 13-1): chain, wheel, and all-channel.
The chain rigidly follows the formal chain of command; this network approxi￾mates the communication channels you might find in a rigid three-level organiza￾tion. The wheel relies on a central figure to act as the conduit for all group com￾munication; it simulates the communication network you might find in a work 
group directed by a manager. The manager’s central role (especially in larger 
work groups) enables them to enjoy access to diverse ideas and knowledge, sup￾port, and higher power and status.50 The all-channel network permits group mem￾bers to actively communicate with each other; it is most often characterized by 
self-managed teams, in which group members are free to contribute and no single 
person takes on a leadership role. Many organizations today like to aspire toward 
the all-channel network, meaning that anyone can communicate with anyone.
As Exhibit 13-2 demonstrates, the effectiveness of each network is deter￾mined by the outcome you are interested in. The structure of the wheel 
facilitates the emergence of a leader, the all-channel network is best if you

desire high member satisfaction, and the chain is best if accuracy is most 
important. However, despite our best efforts to create formal network struc￾tures, it would be folly to assume that people do not exchange with one 
another informally. These informal networks hold great power and political 
influence, disrupting coordination in innovation teams and blocking out 
the formation of new relationships (when networks are particularly dense 
and strong).51 Second, just because the network structure permits communi￾cation and information exchange does not mean that it actually happens—
various formal network structures can lead to similar outcomes, depending 
on the level of communication and strength of bonds between people.52 If 
team members are guarded and secretive in an all-channel network, they 
will probably not share with one another (or selectively share with one 
another).53 Advancement in assessing informal networks in organizations 
has been revolutionized through the use of social networks analysis, dis￾cussed next.
Social Network Analysis: A Tool for Assessing 
Resource Dependence
One tool to assess the informal exchange of resources and dependencies within 
an organization is social network analysis.
54 This method examines patterns of 
communication among organizational members to identify how information 
flows between them. Within a social network, or connections between people 
who share professional interests, each individual or group is called a node, and 
the links between nodes are called ties. When nodes communicate or exchange 
resources frequently, they are said to have very strong ties. Other nodes that 
are not engaged in direct communication with one another achieve resource 
flows through intermediary nodes. In other words, some nodes act as brokers 
between otherwise unconnected nodes. A graphical illustration of the associa￾tions among individuals in a social network is called a sociogram and functions 
like an informal version of an organization chart. The difference is that a formal 
organization chart shows how authority is supposed to flow, whereas a sociogram 
shows how resources really flow in an organization. An example of a sociogram 
is shown in Exhibit 13-3.
Networks can create substantial power dynamics. Those in the position 
of brokers tend to have more power because they can leverage the unique 
resources they can acquire from different groups.55 In other words, many peo￾ple are dependent on brokers, which gives the brokers more power. Data from 
the United Kingdom’s National Health Service show that change agents, people 
entrusted with helping an organization to make a significant change, have more 
success if they are information brokers.56 However, it is paradoxical how pow￾erful brokers within marketing agency networks, even though they are more 
willing to leverage their power, often fail to perceive opportunities to do so.57

This might be due to the fact that, in general, executives often have unreli￾able (or little access to) information about strangers in surrounding networks, 
which makes it difficult to predict whether seeking out or forging new ties will 
be successful.58
Some of the most powerful people within social networks can amass power 
because of their personality traits—for example, their insensitivity to rewards 
(making them resistant to others’ influence), extroversion, and even dark 
triad traits (see the chapter on personality and values) are positively related to 
their social network position and power.59 Stereotype threat (see the chapter 
on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations), however, can also influ￾ence the effectiveness of women in brokerage positions. Because the agency, 
power, and assertiveness demands associated with being in a brokerage posi￾tion contradict stereotypically feminine qualities, women are more likely to 
experience anxiety about their performance and fear of negative evaluation 
in these positions.60
The relationships brokers form within networks are also extremely impor￾tant. People form relationships with their leaders and coworkers, such as 
friendships and partnerships, which nurture mutual reliance and obligation.61
These “ties” are important not only for getting things done in organizations 
but also for employees’ well-being—employees who do not nurture these 
ties or who lose them over time are more likely to leave their organization 
(although these ties can remain dormant, even after the employee leaves!).62
There are many ways to implement a social network analysis in an organi￾zation.63 Some organizations keep track of the flow of e-mail communications

or document sharing across departments through big data. Newer applications 
of AI have enabled organizations and researchers to use machine learning 
algorithms to model the flow of information in social networks over time (and 
learn from events).64 These big-data tools are an easy way to gather objective 
information about how individuals exchange information. Other organizations 
look at data from human resources (HR) information systems, analyzing how 
supervisors and subordinates interact with one another. These data sources can 
produce sociograms showing how resources and power flow (see Exhibit 13-3). 
Leaders can then identify powerful brokers who exert the strongest influence 
on many groups, and consider these key individuals in gaining buy-in or balanc￾ing power.
Influence Tactics
As discussed in the previous chapter, leadership is all about influence. An effec￾tive leader is one who is able to influence others toward the achievement of a set 
of goals or vision. However, at the beginning of this chapter, we differentiated 
leadership from power, showing that there are aspects unique to power that 
matter for our understanding of OB. Although we have a good understanding 
of what effective leaders do (in terms of style and behavior) along with why 
power matters, what influence tactics do people (e.g., leaders) use to translate 
power bases into specific action? What options do they have for influencing 
their supervisors, coworkers, or employees? Research has identified nine dis￾tinct influence tactics:65
• Legitimacy. Relying on your authority position or saying that a request is in 
accordance with organizational policies or rules.
• Rational persuasion. Presenting logical arguments and factual evidence to 
demonstrate that a request is reasonable.
• Inspirational appeals. Developing emotional commitment by appealing to a 
target’s values, needs, hopes, and aspirations.
• Consultation. Increasing support by involving the target in deciding how to 
accomplish your plan.
• Exchange. Rewarding the target with benefits or favors in exchange for 
agreeing to a request.
• Personal appeals. Asking for compliance based on friendship or loyalty.
• Ingratiation. Using flattery, praise, or friendly behavior prior to making a 
request.
• Pressure. Using warnings, repeated demands, and threats.
• Coalitions. Enlisting the aid or support of others to persuade the target to 
agree.
Using Influence Tactics
Some tactics are more effective than others. Rational persuasion, inspirational 
appeals, and consultation tend to be equally effective in influencing perfor￾mance at work.66 Rational persuasion, although still effective at helping build 
relationships at work, tends to not be as superbly effective as inspirational 
appeal and consultation.67 The pressure tactic tends to backfire and is typi￾cally the least effective.68 Using ingratiation can improve relational outcomes 
of influence at work (e.g., during job interviews),69 but perhaps only when 
the audience does not really care about the outcome of the request or if it is 
routine.70

Let us consider the most effective way of getting a raise. You can start with 
a rational approach—figure out how your pay compares to that of your organi￾zational peers, land a competing job offer, gather data that testify to your per￾formance, or use salary calculators like Salary.com, PayScale, or Glassdoor to 
compare your pay with others in your occupation—then share your findings 
with your manager. The results can be impressive. In one instance, a member 
of a product team at a fast-paced startup landed a 12 percent raise when he 
showed his supervisor a list of his accomplishments along with data to sup￾port his value and contribution to the company.71 Using rational persuasion 
to make a case to your supervisor about a possible raise or even an alterna￾tive work arrangement (see the chapter on motivation applications) may be 
effective because it fosters a mutual sense of respect between you and your 
supervisor.72 Similarly, if you are trying to get your supervisor to buy in to your 
idea, coming equipped with a demonstration can help. Research on creatives 
at a video game company found that the use of demos, prototypes, and dem￾onstrations was highly effective at convincing supervisors when coupled with 
persuasive influence tactics.73
While rational persuasion may work in this situation, the effectiveness 
of some influence tactics depends to some extent on the direction of influ￾ence74 and, of course, on the audience. As Exhibit 13-4 shows, rational 
persuasion is the only tactic effective at both upwardly and downwardly 
influencing, although it is stronger when it is used for downward influence 
attempts.75 Inspirational appeals work best as a downward-influencing tac￾tic with subordinates.76 Ingratiation is most effective as lateral influence, 
although it can also be effective in downward influence.77 Other factors 
relating to the effectiveness of influence include the sequencing of tactics, 
a person’s skill in using the tactic, and the organizational culture. In gen￾eral, you are more likely to be effective if you begin with “softer” tactics that 
rely on personal power, such as personal and inspirational appeals, rational 
persuasion, and consultation. If these fail, you can move to “harder” tactics, 
such as exchange and coalitions, which emphasize formal power and incur 
greater costs and risks.78
As we mentioned, the effectiveness of tactics depends on the audience. 
People especially likely to comply with soft influence tactics tend to be more 
reflective and intrinsically motivated; they have high self-esteem and a greater 
desire for control. Those likely to comply with hard influence tactics are more 
action-oriented and extrinsically motivated, and more focused on getting along 
with others than on getting their own way. Interestingly, prior research does not 
support gender differences in the effectiveness of the use of influence tactics—
all benefit from soft or neutral tactics as opposed to harder tactics.79

Automatic and Controlled Processing of Influence
To understand the process of influence, it is useful to consider two different 
ways we process information.80 Think about the last time you were browsing a 
social networking website and came across an ad. Moments later, you did not 
expect to be buying a T-shirt that says, “Don’t mess with a Buckeye fan who loves 
corgis and devours ice cream,” did you? Instead of making a concerted effort to 
research different T-shirt designs, you made an impulse buy that was the result 
of appealing advertising and a highly intelligent machine learning algorithm. 
If we are honest, we will admit flashy marketing can have an influence on our 
choices as consumers,81 and research shows that in this environment, we tend 
to operate in an “automatic” mode, with heart rate and skin conductance data 
to support this.82
We often rely on automatic processing, a relatively superficial consideration 
of evidence and information that takes little time or effort, making use of heu￾ristics like those we discussed in the chapter on perception and decision mak￾ing. Automatic processing can lead people to jump to conclusions about others 
that would normally, after careful thought, cause someone to be more skeptical 
or critical. For instance, when bloggers are forthright about their conflicts of 
interest (e.g., being paid to review a product), you would assume that readers 
would be more skeptical about the review. However, research shows that people 
actually trust these people more because the disclosure serves as a cue for their 
expert power.83 But can this matter for leaders and their followers in organi￾zations? Yes—studies have demonstrated that even subtle motivational cues in 
leader e-mails can influence employee performance and motivation.84 Clearly, 
the disadvantages of automatic processing are that it lets us be fooled easily by a 
variety of tricks, like a cute jingle or glamorous photo, and promotes the shallow 
interpretation of information.
Now imagine someone choosing a place to live. They may source experts 
who know something about the area, gather information about prices, and con￾sider the costs and benefits of renting versus buying. This individual is engaging 
in more effortful controlled processing, a detailed consideration of evidence 
and information relying on facts, figures, and logic. Controlled processing 
requires effort and energy, but it is harder to fool someone who has taken the 
time and effort to engage in it. So what makes someone engage in either shal￾low or deep processing? Some research suggests that a motivational trait (see 
the chapter on motivation theory), need for cognition, predicts the tendency 
to engage in controlled processing.85 These individuals are more likely to be 
persuaded by evidence and facts and are more likely to evaluate arguments care￾fully and critically before coming to a conclusion. Those who are lower in their 
need for cognition are more likely to use automatic processing strategies, rely￾ing on intuition and emotion to guide their evaluation of persuasive messages.
All humans rely on some degree of both automatic and controlled process￾ing. It is not accurate to suggest that we “choose” one or the other or that 
leaders have a “choice” in which processing modes to activate.86 However, 
leaders can leverage their messaging to make use of both types of processes. 
For instance, in contexts where people are more likely to rely on automatic 
processing (e.g., initial product exposure through social media), relying on 
highly emotional messaging and sensory stimulation can facilitate automatic 
processing. However, when people are motivated to dig deeper (e.g., determin￾ing whether they want to move forward in the interview process in a new orga￾nization), the leader can draw on their expert power and rational persuasion 
to convince others.

Applying Influence Tactics
People differ in their political skill, or their ability to influence others to 
attain their own objectives.87 The politically skilled are more effective users of 
influence tactics and rely on their knowledge of others’ demands, resources, 
and preferences to do so.88 They are able to recognize opportunities, 
evaluate the pros and cons of different behaviors, and capitalize on these 
opportunities when it advances their objectives.89 Political skill is important 
especially when social skills are required to do well in your job, such as 
in sales consultants, real estate agents, and other relationship-oriented 
occupations.90 The politically skilled can exert their influence without 
others detecting it, a key element in effectiveness. (It can be damaging to be 
labeled political.)91
We know cultures within organizations differ markedly—some are warm, 
relaxed, and supportive; others are formal and conservative. Some encour￾age participation and consultation, some encourage reason, and still oth￾ers rely on pressure. People who fit the culture of the organization tend to 
obtain more influence.92 Specifically, extroverts tend to be more influential 
in team-oriented organizations, and highly conscientious people are more 
influential in organizations that value working alone on technical tasks. 
People who fit the culture are influential because they can perform espe￾cially well in the domains deemed most important for success. Thus, the 
organization itself will influence which subset of influence tactics is viewed 
as acceptable for use.
Regardless of the cultural fit, however, evidence suggests that motivation 
to be political also matters for whether people will develop political skills or 
use influence tactics at all. In general, extroverts tend to be more prone to 
develop political skills, although agreeableness and conscientiousness are 
also important to some degree.93 Moreover, motivated, risk-tolerant, and 
even Machiavellian (see the chapter on personality and individual differ￾ences) employees are more likely to be motivated to use political influence 
in organizations.94 Some research has also found that Machiavellians some￾times operate under the “camouflage” of political skill, using the labels of 
“political skill” and “influence” to self-interested, sometimes destructive 
ends.95
Overall, political skill leads to several positive individual outcomes for 
employees.96 Developing political skill can help you build self-efficacy, help 
you become more satisfied with your job and committed to your organiza￾tion, and lead you to experience less stress, to a small degree. Furthermore, 
developing political skill can boost your performance and productivity as well 
as enable you to engage in more organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs). 
Probably the most important are the career outcomes: Being politically skilled 
can improve your reputation and career success as you earn a higher income 
and a more prestigious position and are more satisfied with your career. 
Research suggests the reasons why political skill leads to these positive out￾comes are through the reputation and confidence boosts that come along 
with building these skills.97

 Toward a Better World 
 Old Mutual: Realizing a Sustainability Vision 
Through Influence 
 “We’re actually having the conversa￾tion. We’re seeing how, through what 
we do in our day jobs, we can change 
lives.” This quote from a manager 
at Old Mutual illustrates the value 
some influence tactics may have in 
persuading people to adopt sustain￾able and socially responsible goals. 
The sustainability chief at Old Mutual 
organizes workshops with managers, 
future leaders, and employees that 
make a case for the importance of 
social responsibility and sustainability. 
Executives at Old Mutual, an African 
financial services company operating 
in key markets in fourteen countries, 
have made corporate social respon￾sibility (CSR) a central component of 
their strategy. 
 Moreover, their mission state￾ment focuses on value not only for 
shareholders—but also for the stake￾holders of the company. Instead of only 
approaching CSR from a philanthropy 
perspective and volunteering, Old 
Mutual appears to approach the mis￾sion through education, training, and 
the routinization of socially responsible 
behavior. It is one thing to offer oppor￾tunities to give back and an entirely 
other to make it a crucial part of work 
life. Through responsible investing, 
education, and skill development, Old 
Mutual embeds social responsibility 
into all facets of its organization and 
inspires ownership in all employees. 
This approach stems from the Code for 
Responsible Investing in South Africa 
(CRISA), which suggests that collabora￾tion is necessary to garner acceptance, 
implementation, and engagement in 
sustainable practices. This approach 
seems to have paid off for Old Mutual. 
In fact, Old Mutual has invested more 
than $9 billion into socially responsible 
aims. 
 How does Old Mutual approach 
influence? For one, it employs what it 
refers to as a Cultural Transformation 
Toolkit aimed at transforming collec￾tive and individual values, priorities, 
attitudes, and perspectives on social 
responsibility. More specifically, Old 
Mutual takes a four-pronged approach 
to influence: (1) role-modeling desired 
behavior, (2) garnering conviction (e.g., 
establishing what is expected, convinc￾ing why what is expected is essential 
and meaningful), (3) skill-building, and 
(4) formal systems of reinforcement. 
Old Mutual also encourages employ￾ees to consider their place in their 
social network to empower employees 
to become agents of change and influ￾ence themselves. In doing so, they 
assess the health and energy of each 
relationship and diagnose “missing” 
relationships that should be built and 
developed to accomplish goals. 
 The case of Old Mutual reflects 
what many OB theorists, researchers, 
and practitioners suggest when influ￾encing others toward socially respon￾sible missions and goals. For instance, 
Professors Christopher Wickert and 
Frank G. A. de Bakker found in their 
interviews with German CSR managers 
that “it often fell on the CSR manager 
to nudge other middle-managers—in 
marketing, procurement, production, 
and sales—to think about sustainabil￾ity and participate in new initiatives.” 
Establishing a CSR strategy that influ￾ences employees to identify with, 
 support, and implement socially respon￾sible goals takes an immense amount 
of work but can ultimately be reward￾ing. Leaders should approach the task 
in three phases: (1) incubation (i.e., 
reflect on the business purpose, role, 
and what aligns with the organization’s 
mission and values), (2) launch (i.e., 
enthusiastically introduce the initiative 
and foster ownership in employees for 
the idea), and (3) entrenchment (i.e., 
make socially responsible practices 
routine and tangible, not a downstream, 
invisible effect—rather, a physical or 
embodied representation of progress). 
 Several other practices have been 
introduced as ways to garner support 
and persuade others to adopt socially 
responsible behaviors, including 
 coalition building, tying in sustainabil￾ity with everyday business routines and 
outcomes (to increase its salience), 
incentivizing sustainable behavior, and 
using social comparison (e.g., bench￾marking with other companies and 
between units internally). Also critical 
is involving people every step of the 
way. Polling customers, surveying 
employees, and assessing their needs 
can help clarify the CSR issues that 
are most important to stakeholders 
(and, therefore, more likely to attract 
their attention). Another key feature 
to making this work is by encourag￾ing people to speak up and voice their 
opinions and ideas concerning CSR ini￾tiatives. Soliciting feedback and acting 
on it can make it clear to employees 
that their feedback really does make a 
difference. 98

How Power Affects People
Until this point, we have discussed what power is and how it is acquired. But we 
have not yet answered one important question: “Does power corrupt?” For one, 
it is clear that power affects the power-holder: It energizes people, on the one 
hand, but can cause the powerholder to rely more on gut feelings as well as to 
become self-serving and potentially more corrupt.99 So all forms of power can 
lead to the downside of getting “caught up” in the feeling of power.
There is certainly evidence that there are corrupting aspects of power. Power 
can lead people to place their own interests ahead of others’ needs or goals.100
Why does this happen? Interestingly, power not only leads people to focus on 
their self-interests because they can, but it also liberates them to focus inward 
and thus come to place greater weight on their own aims and interests. Power 
also appears to lead individuals to “objectify” others (to see them as tools to 
obtain their instrumental goals) and to see relationships as more peripheral.101
That is not all. Powerful people react—especially negatively—to any threats to 
their competence. People in positions of power hold on to power when they can, 
and individuals who face threats to their power are exceptionally willing to take 
actions to retain it whether their actions harm others or not. Possessing formal 
power can alter how you perceive others’ emotions (e.g., the powerful are quicker 
to detect anger because this threatens their power) and cause you to behave in an 
ineffective way.102 Those given power are more likely to make self-interested deci￾sions when faced with a moral hazard (such as when hedge fund managers take 
more risks with other people’s money because they are rewarded for gains but less 
often punished for losses). People in power are more willing to denigrate others. 
Power also leads to overconfident decision making.103
In one of the biggest corruption scandals of this century, the Organized 
Crime and Corruption Reporting Project has provided journalistic evidence for 
an international laundromat. A laundromat is a system for moving money that 
enables powerful people (e.g., the wealthy, organized crime leaders, corrupt 
politicians) to secretly invest “dirty money,” launder money, or evade taxes. The 
Troika Laundromat, named for its connection to the Troika Dialog (a Russian 
investment bank believed to be behind the laundromat), is a network of over 
seventy shell companies used for moving money (estimates point to billions of 
dollars’ worth). Through a spinning flurry of financial transactions, it becomes 
difficult to learn where the money originates from or whether the money is 
legitimate.104
Power Dynamics
As we have discussed, power does appear to have some important disturbing 
effects on us. But that is hardly the whole story—power is more complicated 
than that. Whether power is used for nefarious reasons depends on a number 
of factors, both to the power-holder and within the environment. For instance, 
people with collectivist values and with strong moral identities may be less likely 
to become corrupted.105 However, individuals with a strong need for power, a 
tendency to react to threat with status- and legitimacy-maintaining ways, and 
certain dark personality traits (e.g., Machiavellianism) may be more likely to 
become corrupted.106 With regard to environmental variables, people are less 
likely to become corrupted when they identify with the group they hold power 
in and when there is clear accountability for their actions.107
Furthermore, people do not necessarily hold on to power forever. Power 
can be systematically maintained over time, or it can be lost. In many ways, 
there are several personal factors that relate to people effectively hanging on to

power.108 People have a number of tools at their disposal, engaging in many of 
the influence techniques discussed earlier to perpetuate their tenure in power. 
Furthermore, certain characteristics of the followers perpetuate the hierarchy. 
For instance, as described earlier, system justification (see the chapter on diver￾sity, equity, and inclusion in organizations) and attribution theory (see the chap￾ters on perception and decision making as well as leadership) are both factors 
that hold power-holders in their positions.109 Regardless, external factors like 
environmental competition and the skill and ability of competitors can lead to 
power loss.110 Moreover, power-holders are often responsible for their own loss 
of power. Ethical transgressions that lead to public outrage, an inability to see 
threats from the comfort of their powerful position, and biased decision making 
(leading to failure) have all been found to precipitate the “dethroning” of the 
powerful.111
Sexual Harassment: Unequal Power in the Workplace
Sexual harassment is defined as any unwanted activity of a sexual nature that 
affects an individual’s employment or creates a hostile work environment.112
According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), 
sexual harassment happens when a person encounters “unwelcome sexual 
advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of 
a sexual nature” on the job that disrupts work performance or that creates an 
“intimidating, hostile, or offensive” work environment.113
According to multiple surveys on sexual harassment up to 52  percent of 
women and up to 43  percent of men have reported being subject to sexual 
harassment behaviors within the last twelve months, and up to 22 percent of 
women and up to 7  percent of men indicated they have experienced sexual 
harassment at work in their lifetimes.114 Sexual harassment is disproportion￾ately prevalent for women in certain types of industries. In an examination 
of the nearly forty-one thousand EEOC sexual harassment charges filed in a 
ten-year span, over 25 percent of these cases were in the customer-facing sector 
(i.e., accommodation, food services, retail).115

It goes without saying that the effects of sexual harassment are deplorable 
and nefarious and, in large part, due to the prevailing climate in the team, 
organization, or region.116 Although the definition changes from country 
to country, 140 nations have at least some policies to protect workers from 
sexual harassment.117 Whether the policies or laws are followed is another 
question, however, and some studies suggest they might not be well imple￾mented.118 In fact, 50  percent of Americans believe that men getting away 
with sexual harassment is a major problem in the #MeToo era.119 Moreover, 
46 percent of Americans believe women not being believed is a major prob￾lem that undermines efforts to prevent sexual harassment and hold transgres￾sors accountable.120
Most studies confirm that power is central to understanding sexual harass￾ment. This seems true whether the harassment comes from a supervisor, 
coworker, or employee, although it is especially pronounced for employ￾ees who have newly acquired power.121 Sexual harassment is more likely to 
occur when there are large power differentials.122 The supervisor–employee 
dyad best characterizes an unequal power relationship, where formal power 
gives the supervisor the capacity to reward and coerce. Because employees 
want favorable performance reviews, salary increases, and the like, supervi￾sors control resources most employees consider important and scarce. When 
there are no effective controls to detect and prevent sexual harassment, abus￾ers are more likely to act. Relatedly, if there are no effective controls to give 
voice to whistleblowers and protect them from retaliation, abusers are more 
likely to act and continue to act.123 The #MeToo and Time’s Up movements 
were formed to establish a coalition giving voice to sexual harassment and 
abuse survivors to quell the tide of sexual harassment in organizations and 
communities.124
Sexual harassment can have a detrimental impact on individuals and the 
organization, but it can be avoided. The manager’s commitment to the process 
and responsibility is critical:125
• Make sure an active policy defines what constitutes sexual harassment, 
informs employees they can be fired for inappropriate behavior, and es￾tablishes procedures for making complaints.
• Reassure employees that they will not encounter retaliation if they file a 
complaint.
• Investigate every complaint and inform the legal and HR departments.
• Make sure offenders are disciplined or terminated.
• Set up in-house training to raise employee awareness of sexual harass￾ment issues.
The bottom line is that managers have a responsibility to protect their 
employees from a hostile work environment. They may easily be unaware that 
one of their employees is being sexually harassed, but being unaware does not 
protect them or their organization. If investigators believe a manager could 
have known about the harassment, both the manager and the company can be 
held liable.
Politics: Power in Action
Whenever people get together in groups, power will be exerted. People in 
organizations want to carve out a niche to exert influence, earn rewards, and 
advance their careers. If they convert their power into action, we describe them 
as being engaged in politics. Those with good political skills will likely use their 
bases of power effectively.126
13-6 Describe how politics 
work in organizations.
M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 456 13/12/22 3:03 AMPower and Politics CHAPTER 13 457
Political Behavior
Essentially, organizational politics focuses on the use of power to affect decision mak￾ing in an organization, sometimes for self-serving and organizationally unsanctioned 
behaviors.127 For our purposes, political behavior in organizations consists of activi￾ties that are not required as part of an individual’s formal role but that influence or 
attempt to influence the distribution of advantages and disadvantages within the 
organization.128 Political behavior gives people some sense of empowerment and 
control in highly political environments (but it can also be exhausting).129
Political behavior is outside specified job requirements. It requires some 
attempt to use power bases. It includes efforts to influence the goals, criteria, or 
processes used for decision making. Our definition is broad enough to include 
varied political behaviors such as withholding key information from decision 
makers, joining a coalition, whistleblowing, spreading rumors, leaking con￾fidential information to the media, exchanging favors with others for mutual 
benefit, and lobbying on behalf of or against a particular individual or decision 
alternative.130 In this way, political behavior is often negative, but not always.
The Reality of Politics
Research has demonstrated that there are multiple ways people construe politics: 
(1) some are reactive, believing that it involves engaging in destructive and manipu￾lative behavior; some are (2) reluctant, viewing it as a necessary evil; still others are 
(3) strategic and view politics as a useful way of getting things done; and finally, 
some have more of an (4) integrated perception, viewing politics as central to the 
reality of decision making.131 Indeed, interviews with experienced managers show 
that most believe political behavior is a major part of organizational life.133 Many 
managers report some use of political behavior is ethical if it does not directly 
harm anyone else. They describe politics as necessary and believe someone who 
never uses political behavior will have a hard time getting things done.
But why, you may wonder, must politics exist? Can it be possible for an orga￾nization to be politics-free? It is possible—if all members of that organization hold 
the same goals and interests, if organizational resources are not scarce, and if per￾formance outcomes are completely clear and objective. But that does not describe 
the organizational world in which most of us live. Organizations have individuals 
and groups with different values, goals, and interests.133 This sets up the potential 
for conflict over the allocation of limited resources, such as budgets, work space, 
and salary and bonus pools. If resources were abundant, all constituencies within 
an organization could satisfy their goals. But because they are limited, not every￾one’s interests can be satisfied. Furthermore, gains by one individual or group 
are often perceived as coming at the expense of others within the organization 
(whether they are or not). These forces create competition among members for 
the organization’s limited resources. Regardless, it appears as if people, although 
often reluctant to engage in political behavior, will do so when it is done through 
prosocial means and with the goal of helping others.134
Maybe the most important factor leading to politics within organizations is 
the realization that most of the “facts” used to allocate limited resources are 
open to interpretation. When allocating pay based on performance, for instance, 
what is good performance? What is an adequate improvement? What constitutes 
an unsatisfactory job? It is in this large and ambiguous middle ground of organi￾zational life—where the facts do not speak for themselves—that politics flour￾ish. Because most decisions must be made in a climate of ambiguity—where the 
organizational reality is open to interpretation—people within organizations 
will use whatever influence they can to support their goals and interests. One 
person’s “selfless effort to benefit the organization” is seen by another as a “bla￾tant attempt to further” their own interests.135

required as part of a person’s formal role 
in the organization but that influence, or

advantages and disadvantages within the

Gossip and the Grapevine
The informal communication network in a group or organization is called the 
grapevine.
136 Typically, the grapevine and gossip are viewed negatively by most peo￾ple.137 Indeed, research shows that untrustworthy gossip can cause people to unfairly 
judge and dislike others.138 Overall, the grapevine is a mixed blessing, leading to 
positive performance because of the sense of social pressure it produces while also 
undermining employee well-being.139 Furthermore, rumors and gossip transmitted 
through the grapevine may play an important role in transmitting information, exer￾cising political will, and navigating the hierarchy.140 Grapevine or word-of-mouth 
information from peers about a company has important effects on whether job 
applicants join an organization,141 even over and above informal ratings on websites 
like Glassdoor. For employers, it is also a way to recruit from within the employees’ 
own networks: For example, the TWT Group (a Canadian IT firm) recruits potential 
applicants from within their own networks, who they know and trust.142
Managers can study the gossip driven largely by employee social networks to 
learn more about how positive and negative information is flowing through the 
organization.143 Furthermore, managers can identify influencers (highly net￾worked people trusted by their coworkers144) by noting which individuals are 
small talkers (those who regularly communicate about insignificant, unrelated 
issues). Small talkers tend to be influencers and are significantly more likely 
to retain their jobs during layoffs.145 Furthermore, one study used AI to detect 
small talk and follow-up questions during one-on-one conversations and was 
able to demonstrate that follow-up questions predicted liking and intentions to 
continue to have conversations with that person in the future.146 However, the 
way “small talkers” go about their deeds matters: Collaborating and helping with 
others, rather than gossip, tend to be related to earning a “central position” in 
the network.147 Regardless, being an active, helpful participant in the grapevine 
appears to help.148 It can even help entrepreneurs doing business in new coun￾tries face the challenges of being labeled as an “outsider,” gaining legitimacy 
through attempting to be a part of local networks and communities.149
Thus, while the grapevine may not be sanctioned or controlled by the orga￾nization, it can be understood and leveraged a bit.
The Causes and Consequences 
of Political Behavior
Now that we have discussed the constant presence of politics in organizations, 
let us discuss the causes and consequences of these behaviors.
Factors Contributing to Political Behavior
Not all groups or organizations are equally political. In some organizations, politics 
are overt and rampant, while in others, politics play a small role in influencing 
outcomes. Why this variation? Research has identified several factors that appear 
to encourage political behavior. Some are individual characteristics, derived from 
employees’ qualities; others are a result of the organization’s culture or internal 
environment. Exhibit 13-5 illustrates how both individual and organizational fac￾tors can encourage political behavior and provide favorable outcomes (increased 
rewards and averted punishments) for individuals and groups in the organization.
Individual Factors At the individual level, researchers have identified cer￾tain personality traits, needs, and other factors likely to be related to political 
behavior. In terms of traits, we find that employees who are high self-monitors,

possess an internal locus of control, and have a high need for power (see the 
chapter on motivation theory) are more likely to engage in political behavior. 
The high self-monitor is more sensitive to social cues, exhibits higher levels 
of social conformity, and is more likely to be skilled in political behavior than 
the low self-monitor. Because they believe they can control their environment, 
individuals with an internal locus of control are more prone to take a proac￾tive stance and attempt to manipulate situations in their favor. Not surprisingly, 
the Machiavellian personality trait (see the chapter on personality and indi￾vidual differences)—characterized by the will to manipulate and the desire for 
power—is consistent with using politics to further personal interests.
An individual’s investment in the organization and perceived alternatives 
influence the degree to which they will pursue illegitimate means of politi￾cal action.150 The more a person expects increased future benefits from the 
organization and the more that person has to lose if forced out, the less likely 
they are to use illegitimate means. Conversely, the more alternate job oppor￾tunities an individual has—due to a favorable job market, possession of scarce 
skills or knowledge, a prominent reputation, or influential contacts outside the 
organization—the more likely the person is to employ politics. An individual 
with low expectations of success from political means is unlikely to use them. 
High expectations from such measures are most likely to be the province of 
both experienced and powerful individuals with polished political skills and 
inexperienced employees who misjudge their chances.
Finally, some individuals engage in more political behavior because they 
simply are better at it. Such individuals read interpersonal interactions well, fit 
their behavior to situational needs, and excel at networking.151 These people 
are often indirectly rewarded for their political efforts. For example, a study 
of a construction firm in southern China found that politically skilled subor￾dinates were more likely to receive recommendations for rewards from their 
supervisors and that politically oriented supervisors were especially likely to 
respond positively to politically skilled subordinates.152 Other studies have 
also shown that higher levels of political skill are associated with higher levels 
of perceived job performance.153

Organizational Factors Although we acknowledge the role that individual differ￾ences can play, the evidence more strongly suggests that certain situations and con￾texts promote politics. Specifically, when an organization’s resources are declining, 
when the existing pattern of resources is changing, and when there is opportunity 
for promotions, political behavior is more likely to surface.154 When resources are 
reduced, people may engage in political actions to safeguard what they have. Also, 
any changes, especially those implying significant reallocation of resources within 
the organization, are likely to stimulate conflict and increase political behavior.
Cultures characterized by low trust, role ambiguity, unclear performance 
evaluation systems, democratic decision making, high pressure for perfor￾mance, and self-serving senior managers will also create breeding grounds for 
political behavior.155 Because political activities are not required as part of the 
employee’s formal role, the greater the role ambiguity, the more employees can 
engage in unnoticed political activity. Role ambiguity means that the prescribed 
employee behaviors are not clear. In this situation, there are fewer limits to the 
scope and functions of the employee’s political actions.
The more an organizational culture emphasizes the zero-sum or win–lose 
approach to reward allocations (which often begins as a result of financial vulner￾ability), the more employees will be motivated to engage in political behavior.156
The zero-sum approach treats the reward “pie” as fixed, so any gain one person or 
group achieves comes at the expense of another person or group. For example, if 
$15,000 is distributed among five employees for raises, any employee who gets more 
than $3,000 takes money away from one or more of the others. Such a practice 
encourages making others look bad and increasing the visibility of what you do.
Factors Contributing to Political Behavior Acquiescence
In many ways, political behavior is a very interpersonal phenomenon. It involves 
interaction between two or more people, with one or more of these people 
attempting to influence the others to do something. Professor Robert Cialdini 
has devoted much of his career to identifying the social forces behind how people 
can be influenced. These are not individual differences (like those discussed ear￾lier) or contextual features of the environment that influence who “succumbs” to 
political behavior—rather, they are social forces underlying our shared humanity 
that can drive us to acquiesce to another’s influence attempt. Cialdini outlined 
a number of these evidence-based forces as the Six (now Seven) Principles of 
Persuasion.157 Many of these may seem familiar to you—indeed, they are com￾mon social forces that have a substantial impact on behavior in organizations.
• Reciprocity: People are motivated to give back to others who have done 
something for them.
• Consistency/commitment: People are motivated to remain consistent with 
and committed toward decisions or choices they have already made.
• Social proof: People look to others for proof, verification, and validation 
that they have acted in the right way.
• Liking: People who like one another tend to agree with one another.
• Authority: People are more likely to say yes to requests from power-holders.
• Scarcity: People want more of what is not as available or that which is be￾coming less available.
• Unity: The newest principle of persuasion: People are most influenced by 
those with whom they identify.
How Do People Respond to Organizational Politics?

the internal politics. “A couple of the writers here spend more time kissing up to

the executive producer than doing any work. And our head writer clearly plays 
favorites. While they pay me a lot and I get to really use my creativity, I’m sick 
of having to be on alert for backstabbers and constantly having to self-promote 
my contributions. I’m tired of doing most of the work and getting little of the 
credit.” We all likely know friends or relatives like Kai who regularly complain 
about the politics at their jobs. But how do people in general react to organiza￾tional politics? Let’s look at the evidence.
In general, most people view politics in one of four ways: (1) as destructive and 
manipulative, (2) as a necessary evil, (3) as a useful strategy to get things done, and 
(4) as an immutable aspect of organizational life.158 Regardless, for most people 
who are unwilling to play the politics game, outcomes tend to be predominantly 
negative. See Exhibit 13-6 for a diagram of this situation, illustrating how politics 
lead to decreased job satisfaction, increased anxiety and stress, increased turn￾over, and reduced performance. Research has demonstrated that the more poli￾tics play a role in one’s environment, organization, or team, the more negative 
outcomes will be experienced (e.g., increased stress and turnover intentions as 
well as decreased morale and performance), regardless of how necessary people 
perceive them to be.159 Politics may lead to self-reported declines in employee 
performance, perhaps because employees perceive political environments to be 
unfair, which demotivates them.160
The politics–performance relationship appears to be affected by an indi￾vidual’s understanding of the “hows” and “whys” of organizational politics. 
Researchers noted, “An individual who has a clear understanding of who is 
responsible for making decisions and why they were selected to be the deci￾sion makers would have a better understanding of how and why things happen 
the way they do than someone who does not understand the decision-making 
process in the organization.” When both politics and understanding are high, 
performance is likely to increase because these individuals see political activity 
as an opportunity. This is consistent with what you might expect for individuals 
with well-honed political skills. But when understanding is low, individuals are 
more likely to see politics as a threat, which can have a negative effect on job 
performance.161

 When employees see change as a threat, they may respond with defensive 
behaviors —reactive and protective behaviors to avoid action, blame, or change. 163
( Exhibit 13- 7 provides some examples.) These behaviors can be a part of politi￾cal behavior, but in a destructive, negative sense. Instead of attempting to influ￾ence people in “soft,” bond-affirming ways, these behaviors protect self-interests 
through aggressive or avoidant means. In the short run, employees may find that 
defensiveness protects their self-interest, but in the long run, it wears them down. 
However, employees who have been bullied, harassed, or victimized should take 
action to defend themselves—we are more specifically referring to defensive 
behaviors many engage in to cling to power for self-interested aims.

 Myth or Science? Office Politics Should Be Avoided Altogether 
 Office politics have a terrible repu￾tation. When employees perceive 
their workplace as more political, 
it is not surprising that they are seen 
as less engaged, less productive, and 
more likely to quit. Employees are in 
part justified in their dislike of office 
politics. Bad politics (such as spread￾ing rumors or using other strategies to 
advance oneself at the expense of oth￾ers or the organization) can undoubt￾edly be very harmful and should be 
avoided. 
 Yet office politics are often unavoid￾able. Whether or not employees 
choose to participate in them, office 
politics often shape teams and, 
ultimately, their work. Furthermore, 
politics are not all bad, and good poli￾tics can serve a higher purpose with￾out the damaging effects we often 
assume they have. In fact, politics can 
be used to advance one’s interests, 
gain recognition for your contribu￾tions, affect how others think, and 
inform critical decisions. Competency 
on four dimensions of political skill 
(e.g., emotional intelligence, interper￾sonal influence skill, networking ability, 
and apparent sincerity or authenticity) 
also improves leadership, promotion 
prospects, and performance. Political 
skill can even be an asset for those 
who may be less extroverted or not 
the most knowledgeable person in the 
room. 
 While bad politics should certainly 
be avoided, avoiding office politics alto￾gether can have adverse outcomes. 
For example, one study found that less 
politically skilled managers had employ￾ees who were less engaged when the 
managers told them what to do and 
provided feedback. In contrast, employ￾ees with politically skilled managers 
viewed these same behaviors more 
favorably. Thus, instead of abandon￾ing office politics, individuals should 
focus on cultivating political skills that 
will benefit their careers, teams, and 
organizations. 162
 Voice and Silence 
Voice Voice refers to informal, discretionary communication of suggestions, 
concerns, or opinions about work-related issues to people who might be able to 
take appropriate action. 164 Voice is important because it highlights the influence 
capabilities of people who may not hold formal leadership positions or operate 
from substantial bases of power. By definition, voice is a form of influence—
it challenges the status quo, supports others’ viewpoints, adds constructively, 
or is defensive or destructive. 165 It also reaffirms the employee experience—by 
giving voice to others, is space for people to share their concerns and ideas 
in a way that contributes to the organization and crafts a fair, equitable work 
environment. 
 Voice may be affected by employees’ self-evaluation, personal initiative, 
sense of responsibility, and engagement as well as workplace climate and the 
emotions and behavior of their supervisor. 166 Moreover, of the Big Five person￾ality traits, extroverted, open, and conscientious people tend to be more likely 
to voice their concerns. 167 Research shows that voice has a beneficial effect on 
 voice Discretionary communication of 
suggestions, concerns, or opinions about 
work-related issues to people who might be 
able to take appropriate action.

organizational performance. Reviews of research with more than fifty thou￾sand employees suggest that leadership and managerial practices that encour￾aged employee voice resulted in heightened job performance.168 Furthermore, 
research on employee voice behaviors suggests that voice concerns about prob￾lems have positive emotional outcomes for employees.169 Clearly, there can be 
benefits for providing employees with a way to get things that are bothering 
them about work “off their chest.”
Managers often have their preferences for “how” employees engage in 
voice behavior. For instance, managers can often find “public” voice to be 
threatening to their image or to their personal control and prefer if it were 
expressed one-on-one.170 Moreover, if employees’ voice is not considered, 
employees may be more reluctant to speak up in the future. Managers should 
provide reasons for why they did not follow through to foster psychological 
safety and maintain justice perceptions.171 The culture also matters—there 
are different norms and values (e.g., power distance; see the chapter on diver￾sity, equity, and inclusion in organizations) that signal whether it is safe and 
effective for employees to speak up, and some cultures do not value open 
employee communication as much as others.172 These norms and values do 
not necessarily stem from national or ethnic cultures—organizational culture 
beliefs (e.g., valorizing masculinity, minimizing harassment seriousness) and 
network characteristics (e.g., networks composed mostly of men in central 
positions) can limit voice in the face of sexual harassment.173
Exhibit 13-7 Defensive Behaviors
Avoiding Action
Overconforming. Strictly interpreting your responsibility by saying things like “The rules
clearly state...”or “This is the way we’ve always done it.”
Buck passing. Transferring responsibility for the execution of a task or decision to
someone else.

Silence It is easy to ignore silence because it is defined by the absence of influ￾ence. However, this is often a mistake—silence itself can be a form of influence, 
communicating noninterest, the inability to deal with a topic, or a desire to 
cooperate smoothly without interruption.174 Silence, similar to the definition 
of voice, suggests that it involves the discretionary withholding of suggestions, 
concerns, or opinions about work-related issues from those who might be able 
to do something about it.175
Why are employees and managers silent even when they probably should 
speak up? The answer to this question appears to be a complicated calculus 
of the person’s individual differences and motivations and (automatic and 
strategic) decision-making processes. Moreover, whether one chooses to stay 
silent is also affected by the content of the message, the style in which it 
is delivered, and the target of the message.176 Perceptions of target open￾ness and trustworthiness and an employee sense of powerlessness as well as 
a tendency to experience negative emotions (especially fear) tend to influ￾ence the decision to stay silent.177 Managers and employees alike should try 
to forge an environment where people are comfortable sharing, feel empow￾ered to share, and are open to other thoughts and opinions, even to bad 
news.178
Furthermore, the environment should be one in which silence is not 
rewarded or voice is punished. For instance, even managers who speak up 
about wrongdoing in organizations can be subject to not only official sanc￾tioning but also bullying, reduced job satisfaction, and status perceptions.179
But sometimes it is not just the environment but the interpersonal dynamics 
that get in the way. For instance, employees can feel like they have their voice 
“needs” met when they voice their concerns with employees (e.g., venting ses￾sions) and, as a result, neglect to say anything to their managers or supervi￾sors.180 Finally, some forms of silence are strategic. For instance, executives are 
less likely to publicize or market their sustainability certifications in the midst 
of scandals that contradict their sustainability standards (out of a fear of com￾ing off as hypocritical).181
silence Discretionary withholding of 
suggestions, concerns, or opinions about 
work-related issues from people who might 
be able to take appropriate action.

For whatever reasons (and there are many of them, including fear, resigna￾tion, and even prosocial motives),182 research suggests using silence and with￾holding communication are common and problematic.183 It is an especially 
uncomfortable burden when managers and employees feel obligated to speak 
up but feel like they are not able to do so.184 It can also be problematic for 
the recipients of silence. For instance, in one series of experiments, people who 
were ostracized and excluded felt worse when they were not acknowledged at 
all. Even when they were still excluded, a simple nonverbal acknowledgement 
or a message (even a hostile one!) increased their satisfaction and recovery 
from the stressful event.185 Moreover, people engage in attribution processes 
as the recipients of silence and often see those who withhold information as 
unethical (while the person staying silent thinks they are acting ethically—it 
is better to say nothing than to say something they might regret!).186 Clearly, 
silence may be characterized by a great deal of impression management, which we 
discuss next.
Impression Management
We know people have an ongoing interest in how others perceive and evaluate 
them. Being perceived positively by others has benefits in an organizational 
setting, and it is a process that involves interacting with people, not just one 
person in isolation.187 It might, for instance, help us initially to get the jobs 
we want in an organization and, once hired, to get favorable evaluations, sal￾ary increases, and more rapid promotions. Managers may use it to protect 
their reputations during communications with investors and board members 
(e.g., earnings forecasts),188 to appear authentic and trustworthy to followers 
(e.g., through humorous self-disclosures),189 or to allay public fears during 
times of crisis—remaining calm and composed.190 Managing how others per￾ceive them is especially important, for example, to expatriates representing 
their organizations in other countries and requires them to adapt to cultural 
norms.191 The process by which individuals attempt to control the impres￾sions that others form of them is called impression management (IM).
192 See 
Exhibit 13-8 for examples.
This process can be conscious or unconscious and can be perceived as 
authentic or disingenuous.193 When perceived as inauthentic or disingenu￾ous, IM can lead to decrements in performance, increased anxiety, and nega￾tive feelings.194 When perceived as modest, authentic, and genuine (e.g., 
disclosing something negative and humorous about yourself to relate with 
another person), IM can lead others to see you more positively and lead to 
better relationship outcomes.195 Furthermore, IM behaviors themselves can 
be the norm in organizations, groups, or teams196—but this does not mean 
that members of the organization will stop trying to discern whether the 
behaviors are authentic.
IM may also lead to negative effects for the individual engaging in it.197 For 
instance, executives in top management teams who ingratiate themselves to 
the CEO tend to become resentful of the CEO and plot to undermine them, 
especially when the CEO is a woman or from an underrepresented ethnicity.198
Moreover, ingratiation not only breeds anxiety and resentment—it can also lead 
to exhaustion and depletion of personal resources, which can in turn lead to 
deviant behavior.199 The negative outcomes are especially apparent for lead￾ers and managers—given that they are beholden to multiple audiences (e.g., 
the general public, the board of directors, other executives, middle managers, 
employees), their IM attempts, while successful toward some, will inevitably be 
viewed negatively by at least one party.200

Exhibit 13-8 Impression Management (IM) Techniques
Source: Based on M. C. Bolino, K. M. Kacmar, W. H. Turnley, and J. B. Gilstrap, “A Multi-Level Review of Impression Management Motives and 
Behaviors,” Journal of Management 34, no. 6 (2008): 1080–109.
Conformity
Agreeing with someone else’s opinion to gain their approval is a form of
ingratiation.
Example: A manager tells their supervisor, “You’re absolutely right on your reorganization plan
for the western regional office. I couldn’ t agree with you more.”
Favors
Doing something nice for someone to gain that person’ s approval is a form of
ingratiation.
Example: A salesperson says to a prospective client, “I’ve got two tickets to the theater
tonight that I can’t use. Take them. Consider it a thank-you for taking the time to talk
with me.”
Excuses
Explaining a predicament-creating event aimed at minimizing the apparent severity
of the predicament is a defensive IM technique.
Example: A sales manager says to their supervisor, “We failed to get the ad in the paper on
time, but no one responds to those ads anyway.”
Apologies
Admitting responsibility for an undesirable event and simultaneously seeking to get a
pardon for the action is a defensive IM technique.
Example: An employee says to their supervisor, “I’m sorry I made a mistake on the report.
Please forgive me.”
Self-Promotion
Highlighting your best qualities, downplaying your deficits, and calling attention to
your achievements is a self-focused IM technique.
Example: A salesperson tells their supervisor, “Micah worked unsuccessfully for three years
to try to get that account. I sewed it up in six weeks. I’m the best closer this company has.”
Enhancement
Claiming that something you did is more valuable than most other members of the
organizations would think is a self-focused IM technique.
Example: A journalist tells their editor, “My work on this celebrity divorce story was really
a major boost to our sales” (even though the story only made it to page 3 in the
entertainment section).
Flattery
Complimenting others about their virtues in an effort to make yourself appear perceptive
and likeable is an assertive IM technique.
Example: A new sales trainee says to their peer, “You handled that client’s complaint so
tactfully! I could never have handled that as well as you did.”
Exemplification
Doing more than you need to in an effort to show how dedicated and hard working you
are is an assertive IM technique.
Example: An employee sends an e-mail from a work computer while working late so that
the supervisor will know how long they have been working.
Research has primarily examined IM techniques in two different organizational 
contexts: interview success and performance evaluations. Let’s consider each of these.
Interviews and IM The evidence indicates most job applicants and interviewers 
alike use IM techniques in interviews and that it works,201 in part because they 
increase interviewer perceptions of the applicants’ warmth and competence.202
Interviewers are, for the most part, surprisingly unable to detect when an 
M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 466 13/12/22 3:03 AMPower and Politics CHAPTER 13 467
individual is engaging in IM, especially when applicants are using deception to 
engage in IM. 203 To develop a sense of how effective different IM techniques are 
in interviews, one study grouped data from thousands of recruiting and selection 
interviews into appearance-oriented efforts (like looking professional), explicit 
tactics (like flattering the interviewer or talking up your own accomplishments), 
and verbal cues (like using positive terms and showing general enthusiasm). 204
Across all the dimensions, it was quite clear that IM was a powerful predictor of 
how well people did. However, there was a twist. When interviews were highly 
structured, meaning the interviewer’s questions were written out in advance and 
focused on applicant qualifications, the effects of IM were substantially weaker. 
Manipulative behaviors like IM are more likely to have an effect in ambiguous 
and unstructured interviews. In addition, the effectiveness of IM depends on 
the applicants’ ability to correctly identify what traits or skills the interviewer 
is looking for. 205 However, we should note that deceptive IM is not necessarily 
something that is carefully and coldly planned. Research suggests that some 
people have less humility or are more extroverted than others, and when put in 
an anxiety-inducing context, they may talk more often and more boastfully. 206 
Performance Evaluations and IM In terms of performance evaluations, the picture 
is quite different. Indeed, both employees, managers, and executives alike engage 
in IM when newly hired and throughout the rest of their tenure with the organiza￾tion. 207 Ingratiation is positively related to performance ratings and reward alloca￾tions, meaning those who ingratiate themselves with their supervisors get higher 
performance evaluations and (potentially) raises. 208 However, self-promotion 
appears to backfire over time as people begin to recognize the behavior: Those 
who self-promote actually may receive lower performance ratings. 209 There is an 
important qualifier to these general findings. It appears that individuals high in 
 An Ethical Choice 
 How Much Should You Manage Interviewer 
Impressions? 
Almost everyone agrees that 
dressing professionally, highlight
 ing previous accomplishments, 
and expressing interest in the job 
are reasonable IM tactics to improve 
your presentation in an interview. 
Strategies like using positive nonver￾bal cues such as smiling and nodding 
are also often advised. 
 Is there an upside to such IM? 
Research generally shows there is. 
The more effort applicants put into 
highlighting their skills, motivation, and 
admiration for the organization, the 
more likely they will be hired. A study in 
Taiwan examined this relationship, find￾ing that interviewers saw applicants 
who talked confidently about their 
qualifications as a better fit for the job 
and applicants who said positive things 
about the organization as a better fit 
for the organization. Positive nonver￾bal cues improved interviewer moods, 
which also improved the applicant’s 
ratings. 
 Despite evidence that trying to 
impress an interviewer can pay off, you 
can go too far. Evidence that a person 
misrepresented qualifications in the 
hiring process is usually grounds for 
immediate termination. Even so-called 
harmless lies are a problem if they cre￾ate unfounded expectations. For exam￾ple, if you noted that you managed 
budgets when all you were doing was 
tracking expenditures, you lack skills 
your boss will expect you to have. When 
you fail to deliver, it will look terrible for 
you. However, if you describe your expe￾rience more accurately but note your 
desire to learn, the company will know 
that you need additional training and 
that you will need a bit of extra time. 
 So what does an ethical, effective 
interview strategy entail? The key is to 
find a positive but truthful way to man￾age impressions. Do not be afraid to 
let an employer know about your skills 
and accomplishments, and be sure to 
show your enthusiasm for the job. At 
the same time, keep your statements 
as accurate as possible, and be care￾ful not to overstate your abilities. In 
the long run, you are much more likely 
to be happy and prosperous in a job 
where both you and the interviewer can 
assess fit honestly. 210
M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 467 13/12/22 3:03 AM468 PART 3 The Group
Are our conclusions about responses to politics valid around the world? Should 
we expect employees in Israel, for instance, to respond the same way to workplace 
politics that employees in the United States do? Almost all our conclusions on 
employee reactions to organizational politics are based on studies conducted in 
North America. The few studies that have included other countries suggest some 
minor modifications.214 One study of managers in U.S. culture and three regions in 
East Asia (People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) found U.S. managers 
evaluated “gentle persuasion” tactics such as consultation and inspirational appeal as 
more effective than did their counterparts in any of the three East-Asian regions.215
Other research suggests effective U.S. leaders achieve influence by focusing on the 
personal goals of group members and the tasks at hand (an analytical approach), 
whereas influential East Asian leaders focus on relationships among group members 
and meeting the demands of people around them (a holistic approach).216 Another 
study of Chinese supervisors and subordinates found thaƒt subordinates were seen 
as more agreeable and conscientious when they engaged in self-effacing behaviors, 
but only if these behaviors made them appear modest rather than supplicating.217
The Ethics of Behaving Politically
Although there are no clear-cut ways to differentiate ethical from unethical 
political behavior, there are some questions you should consider. For exam￾ple, what is the utility of engaging in political behavior? Sometimes we do it 
for little good reason or disregard for the situation. For instance, the popular 
press abounds with rigid platitudes that are hardly useful in every work situa￾tion (e.g., “don’t complain,” “arrive early and stay late,” “under-promise and 
over-deliver”).218 One thing to keep in mind is whether it is worth the risk. 
Another question is whether the utility of engaging in the political behavior will 
balance out harm (or potential harm) to others. Complimenting a supervisor 
to curry favor is probably much less harmful than grabbing credit for a project 
that others deserved. Finally, does the political behavior conform to justice and 
fairness standards? Could anyone reasonably reject your behavior?
Unfortunately, powerful people can become very good at explaining 
self-serving behaviors in terms of the organization’s best interests. They can per￾suasively argue that unfair actions are really fair and just. Those who are power￾ful, articulate, and persuasive are most vulnerable to ethical lapses because they 
are more likely to get away with them. When faced with an ethical dilemma 
regarding organizational politics, try to consider whether playing politics is 
worth the risk and whether others might be harmed in the process. If you have 
a strong power base, recognize the ability of power to corrupt. Remember that 
it is a lot easier for the powerless to act ethically, if for no other reason than they 
typically have very little political discretion to exploit.
Mapping Your Political Career
As we have seen, politics is not just for politicians. You can use the concepts 
presented in this chapter in some very tangible ways in your organization. 
However, they also have another application: you. In considering the OB Poll, 
political skill are able to translate IM into higher performance appraisals, whereas 
those lower in political skill are more likely to be hurt by their IM attempts.211
One study of 760 boards of directors found that individuals who ingratiated them￾selves with current board members (e.g., expressed agreement with the director, 
pointed out shared attitudes and opinions, complimented the director) increased 
their chances of landing on a board.210 Another study found that interns who 
attempted to use ingratiation with their supervisors were usually disliked—unless 
they had high levels of political skill. For those who had this ability, ingratiation 
led to higher levels of liking from supervisors and higher performance ratings.213
M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 468 13/12/22 3:03 AMPower and Politics CHAPTER 13 469
you may think that if you work hard, advancement should come easy. However, 
there is a different way to think about this, as professor Bud Bilanich of the 
University of Denver notes: “Working hard . . . isn’t going to be enough because 
your competition is also working hard and making contributions.” “To me, I 
think that hard work . . . is kind of like the price of admission.” 219 The second 
most critical factor highlights the role of politics in making your hard work 
pay off: politics. 
 One of the most useful ways to think about power and politics is in terms of 
your own career. 220 What are your ambitions? Who has the power to help you 
achieve them? What is your relationship to these people? The best way to answer 
these questions is with a political map, which can help you sketch out your rela￾tionships with the people on whom your career depends. Exhibit 13- 9 contains 
such a political map. 221 Let us walk through it. 
 Assume your future promotion depends on five people, including Noura, 
your immediate supervisor. As you can see in the exhibit, you have a close rela￾tionship with Noura (you would be in trouble otherwise). You also have a close 
relationship with Margot in finance. However, with the others, you have either a 
loose relationship (Lane) or none (Jia, Marty). One obvious implication of this 
map is the need to formulate a plan to gain more influence over and a closer 
relationship with these people. How might you do that? 
 One of the best ways to influence people is indirectly. What if you played 
in a tennis league with Mark, Noura’s former coworker who you know remains 
friends with Noura? To influence Mark, in many cases, may also be to influence 
Noura. You can complete a similar analysis for the other four decision makers 
and their networks. Of course, this map does not show you everything you need 
to know—no map does. For example, rarely would all five people have the same 
amount of power. Maps are also harder to construct in the era of large social 
networks. 
 All of this may seem a bit Machiavellian to you. However, remember that 
only one person gets the promotion, and your competition may have a map of 
their own. As we noted in the early part of the chapter, power and politics are 
part of organizational life.

Summary
Both power and politics are inherent parts of organizational life. Despite their 
negative connotations and association with unethical behavior, they are not al￾ways immoral. In many ways, power and political influence are significant aspects 
of effective leadership. Although there are some differences between power 
and leadership, both often go together, with many leaders also operating from 
positions of power. In this chapter, we began by describing power and its many 
forms, both formal and informal. We described dependence as the primary key 
to power, operating through the scarcity, importance, and nonsubstitutability of 
resources. These resources, in turn, flow through various social network struc￾tures, and people’s positions in these networks have implications for power. In 
the next part of the chapter, we discuss politics and influence. We suggest that 
the domain of leadership is precisely the same as influence: As defined in the 
chapter on leadership, leadership is the practice of influence. However, not all 
influence tactics are created equally. We discuss a number of the various influ￾ence tactics that have been studied by OB researchers and compare their effec￾tiveness (and ethicality). We discuss how people process influence attempts both

automatically and in a controlled fashion depending on the context, message, 
and circumstances. Acquiescence to influence can also be a function of many 
social forces (e.g., Cialdini’s Principles of Persuasion). Political behavior can also 
be predicted by several individual and contextual factors, resulting in both desir￾able and undesirable outcomes. For instance, we describe how people are more 
or less skilled and motivated at political influence—but nevertheless, it is a skill 
that can be learned. After establishing these foundations, we close the chapter by 
discussing the significant implications of both power and politics. Power creates 
power dynamics, at times resulting in appalling conditions and unethical behav￾ior in organizations (e.g., sexual harassment, bullying, gossip). People generally 
respond to politics negatively, although they are clearly an inevitable part of work. 
For instance, workers and managers alike will always engage in IM depending on 
the situation, and they will always be navigating decisions of exercising voice or 
remaining silent about issues that affect them. These organizational realities high￾light that although we often consider politics and influence to be unethical, some￾times remaining silent and doing nothing can be construed as just as unethical.
Implications for Managers
● Consider cultivating multiple bases of power and 
selectively (yet ethically) drawing upon them 
when the situation calls for it.
● In managing your business, unit, team, or career, 
consider the network of dependence and com￾munication (e.g., the grapevine) between people 
and organizations and use this information to 
guide strategic decisions.
● As a manager, inspirational appeals work very 
well in inspiring subordinates toward a common 
goal. As an employee, rational persuasion is the 
most effective approach when managing upward, 
and ingratiation is most effective with coworkers.
● In general, it is best to avoid pressure tactics and 
defensive behaviors.
● The sequencing of influence tactics matters—it is 
better to start with “softer” influence tactics (e.g., 
inspirational appeals) and move to “harder” tac￾tics (e.g., coalitions) if the softer tactics fail.
● Understand that people process influence at￾tempts both automatically and in a controlled 
fashion—leverage your influence attempts in 
a way that accommodates and recognizes both 
types of processing.
● Influence and politics are skills to be learned—
work to develop your skill and cultivate motiva￾tion for political influence.
● There is some evidence that power corrupts. 
Always be mindful of your situation and behavior 
to avoid sliding down the slippery slope of un￾ethical behavior.
● To combat a hostile work environment, develop 
policies, practices, and procedures that are clear 
and explicit about inappropriate behavior, bar 
retaliation toward whistleblowers, investigate 
complaints, involve both the HR and legal de￾partments, establish punitive measures for trans￾gressors, and implement training and develop￾ment for employees to recognize and confront 
inappropriate behavior.
● For those reluctant to engage in politics, try to 
reframe the behavior (to yourself or to others) as 
prosocial or to help others.
● To reduce the likelihood of problematic political 
behavior, try to reframe resource allocation fairly, 
avoiding a zero-sum approach where possible.
● Both voice and silence are strategic influence 
behaviors—although they may be more or less 
appropriate depending on the situation, in gen￾eral, voice is a preferable behavior, and silence 
can be a damaging behavior. Try to foster an en￾vironment where people feel safe sharing and 
voicing their concerns and avoiding environ￾ments that dissuade people from sharing.
● Everyone engages in IM to some extent, and it 
can be very effective earlier on in a business rela￾tionship. However, as time passes, others may be 
more likely to recognize that you are using these 
techniques, and they can backfire.
● Pick your battles. Not all situations require politi￾cal behavior to be solved. Whenever confronted 
with a situation that might require political influ￾ence, ask yourself several questions. Is it worth it? 
Can others be harmed by my political behavior? 
Can I engage in political behavior while also fol￾lowing standards for justice and ethics?

 Emphasize the Strategies Women Can Use to Get Ahead 
POINT COUNTERPOINT 
Gender bias and a lack of women in leadership positions con￾tinue to be significant issues. For example, in 2020, women 
held just 38  percent of entry-level management positions 
while men held 62 percent. Women of color, in particular, are under￾represented in senior management positions, with 19  percent of 
C-suite positions held by White women and just 3 percent held by 
women of color. Despite the underrepresentation of women in lead￾ership positions, there are strategies that women can employ to 
advance into leadership positions. 
 For instance, Hewlett-Packard carried out a study to determine 
why more women are not in managerial positions. The results showed 
that men tended to apply for a promotion if they believed they had 
met 60 percent of the criteria. In comparison, women tended to doubt 
their qualifications unless they had met 100 percent of the criteria. 
The takeaway is that women should not hesitate to promote them￾selves and apply for more advanced positions. Even if they may not 
meet all the criteria, these gaps can be framed not as weaknesses but 
as a desire to grow and learn. 
 Another obstacle that women face with career advancement is a 
lack of quality feedback. Although women ask for feedback as fre￾quently as men, they are less likely to receive it. When women do 
receive feedback, it is usually less specific. The result is that when 
women receive vague feedback, they are more likely to receive lower 
performance ratings. Because the specific actions or behaviors that 
need to be changed are not identified, it is difficult for women to know 
what to do differently. How then can women receive more detailed 
feedback? Research indicates that highly self-aware individuals solicit 
feedback from a small circle (who are actively interested in their suc￾cess and have a track record of honesty). The self-awareness that can 
be developed through better feedback can translate into better com￾munication and stronger relationships and ultimately help individu￾als be more effective leaders. By employing the strategies mentioned, 
women can take tangible steps toward advancing their careers. 
 Rather than expecting women to learn strategies to navigate 
biased systems and structures, we should be focused on 
changing these systems and structures. For example, data 
from the Working Mother Research Institute found that 48 percent of 
men report having received detailed information on career paths to 
more senior positions. In comparison, just 15 percent of women re￾ported receiving this type of information. Also, 54 percent of men had 
a career discussion with a mentor or sponsor in the last twenty-four 
months, while 39 percent of women did. The inequality in receiving 
sponsorship and mentorship between men and women is a funda￾mental reason women do not advance at the same rate as men and 
why they leave positions. As a result, individual women’s strategies 
can only go so far if there are no formal policies and procedures that 
define the behaviors, expectations, and steps for sponsorship. 
 Furthermore, two surveys from 2018 by Lean In and Bloomberg 
Media indicate that some men have begun to avoid professional work 
relationships with women. They avoid professional working relation￾ships because of the series of high-profile workplace sexual harass￾ment and assault allegations. Thus, it is even more crucial that orga￾nizations do not just expect individuals in senior positions to seek out 
individuals to mentor or sponsor on their own. 
 Yet another significant systemwide barrier is the family leave poli￾cies that often penalize women with children. For example, the aver￾age length of paid leave offered at the top U.S. medical schools is 
only eight weeks. Family leave policies, in general, are often left to the 
discretion of departments. Unfortunately, shorter leaves have the po￾tential to lower motivation, increase burnout, and ultimately hurt the 
retention of female physicians. The impact can be seen in the number 
of women advancing within the medical field. Even though women 
make up most students enrolled in medical school, they only make 
up 34 percent of physicians in the United States. Also, just 18 percent 
of hospital CEOs and 16 percent of all deans and department chairs 
are women. Thus, the onus must be placed on organizations to make 
systematic changes that provide greater access and opportunities for 
women to advance in their careers. 222

13-7 What are the causes, consequences, and eth￾ics of political behavior?
APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
Power and politics are an important part of organizational 
behavior. Who has power (and who does not) shapes what 
transpires in organizations, the flow of resources, and in￾terpersonal dynamics. There are many tactics that people 
can use to gain power and to influence those in power. 
Individuals can also influence others through political 
behaviors. In this chapter, you used many different skills 
that are important to your employability while learning 
about power and politics. You learned self- and career 
management skills while reading about how to influence 
others toward a sustainable vision through Old Mutual’s 
example, evaluating whether politics should be avoided 
altogether, determining how much IM to engage in dur￾ing a job interview, and debating whether to emphasize 
the strategies to get ahead (versus lobbying for systemic 
change). In the next section, you will further apply these 
skills (along with leadership and critical thinking skills) 
to influencing the direction in an ad hoc team, evaluat￾ing the ethics of office romances, and navigating a hostile 
work environment.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE The Turnaround Task Force
Randomly assign students to groups of five to seven peo￾ple. Your team (a technical assistance team [TAT]) is 
tasked with creating a plan to improve schools’ academic 
performance within a particular school district. The TAT 
is part of an educational consulting firm (the Turnaround 
Task Force) that quickly forms ad hoc teams and deploys 
them to areas experiencing educational challenges, where 
the stakes are high.
This school district is a fast-growing, large district in 
the downtown of an up-and-coming metropolitan area. 
Although this city was once known as a very undesirable 
place to live, things are changing for the better. Many 
companies are “setting up shop” in the area, attracted by 
the low tax rate, logistical infrastructure, and proximity to 
other regions.
However, the schools in this district have struggled for 
years to raise standardized test scores and student atten￾dance. Your TAT heard through the grapevine of teach￾ers who work in this district that it is controlled by the 
“Sovereign Six.” The name was apparently given by a his￾tory teacher at one of the schools, commenting on how 
they hold an unwieldy amount of power and do not seem 
to have any accountability.
The school district also has limited financial resources. 
Moreover, it is unclear whether the resources the district 
does have are being used appropriately. After interview￾ing several teachers, it becomes obvious that the message 
each year is clear: Assessments do not really matter—just 
do your best. The district has done the same things in the 
same way for decades, and the Sovereign Six seem com￾mitted to keeping things just the way they are. When your 
team asked for a paper trail in advance of what the district 
does to plan for and evaluate assessment performance, 
you could not get a straight answer. Furthermore, the 
documentation you were sent was vague and ambiguous.
You are meeting as a team for the first time. Your team 
has twenty minutes to create a plan. After completing the 
exercise, answer the following questions.
M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 473 13/12/22 3:03 AM474 PART 3 The Group
Questions
13-8. During the exercise, did a clear leader emerge?
13-9. If a clear leader did emerge, what were the character￾istics of the leader? What actions did the leader 
take to influence the rest of the group? Does 
this person match your understanding of how a 
leader should behave? Why or why not? If a clear 
leader did not emerge, how did you act together 
to accomplish the task? Were there any power 
dynamics that came up as a result of the lack of 
leadership?
13-10. Were there any conflicts or differences in opin￾ions that you encountered during the exercise? 
Explain. In the conflicts that did arise, were 
there any influence tactics or power bases 
referenced?
13-11. Do you agree that leaders can operate through 
more subtle means (e.g., influence), not just 
by “taking charge”? Can exercising power be 
subtle? Why or why not?
ETHICAL DILEMMA Sexual Harassment and Office Romances
In this chapter, we discussed sexual harassment and 
how uneven power dynamics can contribute to sexual 
harassment. Sexual harassment often occurs because one 
employee, such as a supervisor, can use their control of 
resources to reward or coerce another employee into 
sexual behaviors. For example, when a manager asks 
a subordinate to go on a date, the subordinate is more 
likely to say yes because the manager has control over re￾sources in the organization. If the subordinate declines 
the request, the manager could retaliate and withhold 
privileges from the subordinate.
Many companies try to prevent sexual harassment by 
forbidding coworkers from dating. Some have slightly 
softer rules. They forbid employees from dating their di￾rect supervisors or coworkers in the same department, 
presumably so employees cannot use their power to 
perpetrate sexual harassment. These less stringent poli￾cies do not account for informal power that may exist in 
organizations. An employee can be in a junior position 
and still be able to withhold access to resources. This em￾ployee can still have enough political skills to harm an￾other employee’s career.
On the other hand, it may be impractical to try to en￾force a policy against office romances. Modern Americans 
spend one-third of their lives working, so an employee will 
likely meet a partner at the office. According to a 2020 
survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, 
27  percent of employees have dated a coworker. Many 
of these romances involved a power difference as well: 
27 percent admitted that they had dated a supervisor.
Is it worth discouraging office romances? Another sur￾vey from CareerBuilder revealed that almost one-third 
of office relationships resulted in marriage. And what 
should you do if Cupid’s arrow strikes you in the break￾room? National workplace expert Lynn Taylor has this ad￾vice, “Policy or no policy, love happens. So in the absence 
of written rules... there’s one common barometer: your 
common sense.”223
Questions
13-12 . Do you think offices should include rules about 
office romances in their sexual harassment poli￾cies? Why or why not?
13-13. Is it ever okay for a supervisor to date a subordi￾nate? What if someone becomes their romantic 
partner’s supervisor after the relationship was 
already initiated?
13-14. Why might 36 percent of survey respondents 
say that they hid their romantic relationships 
from coworkers? How does this relate to what 
we learned about office gossip in the chapter on 
group behavior?
CASE INCIDENT Imperium Omni
Shonda works for a large private security firm, Imperium 
Omni, in the Chicago O’Hare International Airport. 
Before working in this position, Shonda worked for a few 
years with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA). Once offered the job, Shonda was excited about 
her new role as a guard in charge of screening vehicles 
and individuals on the runway. However, on Shonda’s 
first day, she witnessed some incidents that were hard to 
overlook.
After one of the senior guards trained her on the ba￾sics, he put her in charge of screening people. “I’m just 
going to go manage the security booth for a while. I think 
you can handle this.” However, when Shonda came to 
check in with the guard after her shift was over, she was 
shocked to see from the outside that he was on a sexually 
explicit website. Shonda was very conscientious and had 
read the employee handbook front to back, so she knew 
this was a clear violation of company policy.
M13_ROBB0025_19_GE_C13.indd 474 13/12/22 3:03 AMPower and Politics CHAPTER 13 475
Nonetheless, she did not want to stir up trouble on 
her first day, especially with a senior guard. She figured 
there must be some reason he was a senior employee. She 
thought, “It’s probably just an isolated incident,” and de￾cided to try to forget it. Unfortunately, this was only the 
beginning. Her supervisor, Richard, started to make com￾ments about her appearance, and she noticed he would 
do the same thing to other women at Imperium. At first, 
she thought maybe she was just overacting. After all, he 
was complimenting her. But then he began to find ex￾cuses to do things that made her uncomfortable. Several 
times while she was using the copier, he would approach 
her from behind and then push up against her. When 
she would give him a disapproving look, he would simply 
smile and say, “Oh, my bad.” Then, there was the time 
he and a group of guards were standing around laugh￾ing at a photo that was supposed to be funny but was 
very explicit. They called her over and asked her what 
she thought of it. When she said, “You all are disgust￾ing,” they just burst out laughing. Shonda now dreaded 
coming to work every day. Despite this feeling, Shonda 
continued to focus on doing her job well. After two years 
of working tirelessly, although she was not noticed by 
Richard, a manager at the airport recommended her to 
be promoted to a supervisor.
Shonda finally felt a sense of relief. Now that she was a 
supervisor, things would be different. She was at the same 
level as Richard and above some of the other guards. She 
would not have to deal with their demeaning comments. It 
was not long after she became a supervisor that she would 
overhear the other supervisors making inappropriate com￾ments about the female guards’ appearance.
Shonda realized she had to do something, especially 
now that she was a supervisor. It was no longer just about 
her; other women were also impacted. Although she did 
not necessarily have proof, she figured there was strength 
in numbers. Shonda did what the employee handbook 
says: She filed a formal complaint. She kept waiting for 
the other supervisors to give her a hard time about it. But 
months went by, and no one followed up with her. It was as 
if she had never filed the complaint.
At this point, Shonda started to wonder what she was 
doing wrong. She decided to do some more research be￾cause she had no formal training or education in manage￾ment, much less experience teaching or training anyone. 
After reading The Essential HR Handbook, she decided 
to rethink her strategy. She had been trying so hard to 
change Richard and the other supervisors’ behavior, but 
with little success. Shonda realized she had been looking 
at it all wrong. She needed to change the culture from the 
beginning. When someone was needed to train the new 
guards, she jumped at the opportunity.
Shonda believed she could train the guards to focus on 
the critical work the guards were there to do. She could 
teach the female guards to speak up and report sexual ha￾rassment. Initially, Shonda felt like she was doing just that. 
During the training sessions for new guards, she saw that 
the guards were motivated to do the work, and they found 
the training valuable. For Shonda, the goal of the training 
was to make it clear that this was a sexual harassment–free 
environment, and there were specific rules about how em￾ployees should act in the workplace.
She also held refresher classes for the existing guards 
during which she reviewed the protocols for reporting is￾sues of harassment. She would remind them that she was a 
support person—if they did not feel comfortable reporting 
incidents, she could do so on their behalf. One day when 
Shonda was teaching a refresher class, a guard shared that 
she overheard a few guards making inappropriate com￾ments about another guard. Shonda immediately takes ac￾tion by reporting the incidents and reminds the class, “You 
all should continue to share any incidents like this with 
me. That’s what I’m here for, and you can trust that I will 
tell management so that there are consequences for this 
behavior.” At the end of another training session, a woman 
guard privately shares with Shonda that she was sexually 
assaulted by a co-worker outside of work. With Shonda’s 
encouragement, the woman decided to report the inci￾dent. Over the next few months, Shonda continues to re￾port incidents of harassment to HR. With time, the sheer 
number of complaints became hard to ignore. This was 
evident when Richard and another supervisor were finally 
suspended. Although it had been a long and slow process, 
Shonda felt a sense of relief that individuals were being 
held accountable for their actions and she hoped that the 
work she was doing would help to reduce the number of 
harassment incidents at Imperium. 
Questions
13-15. In what ways did Shonda leverage power and 
influence tactics to combat the toxic culture of 
workplace harassment at Imperium Omni? Were 
there any other tactics she could have used, and 
would they have been effective? Why or why not?
13-16. In this case, there was a sexual harassment policy 
in place, Shonda was persistent in reporting these 
incidents, and she was even promoted. What 
allowed workplace harassment to continue with￾out consequence?
13-17. How do you think the company should handle 
these reports of workplace harassment? What 
strategy would be most effective in preventing fu￾ture instances of harassment from happening?

 THE MERKEL MODEL 
As Germany’s first woman to hold the nation’s highest elective office, 
Chancellor Angela Merkel has seen her fair share of conflict. When she
stepped down in 2021, Merkel became Germany’s second-longest-serving 
leader of the modern era. Merkel was trained as a quantum chemist and lived 
in Soviet-controlled East Germany, working at a state-run research center. It 
was not until the historic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 that Merkel decided 
to leave behind her scientific work and pursue a lifelong interest in politics. 
 Merkel’s training as a scientist has led her to rely on rationality and 
systematic analysis of situations before making decisions, even in tense 
situations. Merkel has become the closest negotiating partner of Vladimir 
Putin, president of Russia, but has also not hesitated to impose sanctions 
on Russia. In 2007, during negotiations with leaders at Putin’s residence, he 
allowed his dog to approach Merkel, despite knowing that Merkel had a fear 
of dogs after having been attacked. Putin appeared instead to be amused 
by the incident. Merkel remained calm, though, and used the moment as an 
opportunity to learn more about Putin’s character. She understood it to be an 
attempt to make Russia appear powerful when, in fact, the country was in a 
vulnerable position with an unstable economy and political system. 
 Merkel’s steady leadership has led to the popularization of the expression 
“ merkeln, ” which describes waiting for a strategic opportunity or carefully 
waiting to make a strategic move. Although not known for being a risk￾taker, Merkel has developed a reputation as a skilled negotiator. While she 
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 477 21/12/22 7:05 AM478 PART 3 The Group
has often been in the role of the outsider, particularly as a woman in a 
male-dominated political culture, Merkel has used this to her advantage 
by thoroughly assessing her negotiation counterparts and determining 
their weaknesses to advance the interests of Germany. A longtime political 
associate of Merkel explained that she only speaks about 20 percent of 
the time and listens 80 percent of the time when engaged in negotiation. 
For example, in her role as minister of the environment, she was able to 
successfully negotiate the Berlin climate deal by consulting Indian diplomat 
Kamal Nath for advice. Merkel was then able to find common ground with 
the countries involved in the deal while reaching an agreement that also 
benefited German engineering firms specializing in green energy.
Merkel demonstrated that learning as much as possible about one’s 
negotiation partner and taking an integrative bargaining approach can indeed 
be an essential part of a successful negotiation. Her deliberate and patient 
approach has allowed her to maintain relationships even with leaders with 
whom she disagrees. Her negotiation style has enabled her to continue 
advancing the German people’s interests during difficult times, including an 
economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.1
A Definition of Conflict
Tesla, an American automotive and energy company, along with its founder 
and CEO, Elon Musk, has experienced conflict on several fronts. From issues 
with Musk’s candid Twitter posts, lawsuits, and feuds with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) to disagreements among Musk and musicians 
Azealia Banks and Claire Boucher (a.k.a. Grimes), Tesla, along with the board 
of directors and employees, has witnessed its fair share of conflict.2
What is interesting, however, is where Tesla has not experienced con￾flict: within the board of directors.3 Many have accused the board of being 
“asleep at the wheel,” not willing to cause conflict where some might be 
needed. This might be due to loyalty to Musk and lack of time and resources 
(most board members are part time) and because all the corporate infor￾mation they receive that affects their decision making is filtered through 
Musk. This has even led some to suggest using artificial intelligence (AI) in 
corporate board decision making, which is not limited by lack of time and 
resources and is perhaps more impartial.4 The case of Tesla illustrates that 
conflict can arise in a number of different organizational arenas and that 
even the absence of conflict altogether can be a signal that perhaps impor￾tant issues are not being discussed or that controversial ideas are not being 
challenged.
There has been no shortage of definitions for the word conflict,5 but com￾mon to most is the idea that conflict is a perception of differences of opposition. 
We define conflict broadly as a process that begins when one party perceives 
that another party has negatively affected or is about to negatively affect some￾thing the first party cares about. People experience a wide range of conflicts 
in organizations over an incompatibility of goals, differences in interpretations 
of facts, disagreements over behavioral expectations, and the like. There is no 
consensus over the role of conflict in groups and organizations.

of conflict and the three 
loci of conflict.

(Dys)functional Conflict
In the past, researchers tended to argue about whether conflict was uniformly 
good or bad. Such simplistic views eventually gave way to approaches recog￾nizing that not all conflicts are the same and that different types of conflict 
have different effects.6 Contemporary perspectives classify conflict based on its 
effects as functional or dysfunctional.7
Functional Conflict Functional conflict supports the goals of the group, improves 
its performance, and is thus a constructive form of conflict. For example, a debate 
among members of a corporate board about the most efficient way to improve 
production can be functional if unique points of view are discussed and com￾pared openly. This form of conflict can be an antidote for groupthink (see the 
chapter on groups). It does not allow the group to passively rubber-stamp deci￾sions that may be based on weak assumptions, inadequate consideration of rele￾vant alternatives, or other weaknesses. Conflict challenges the status quo, furthers 
the creation of new ideas, promotes reassessment of group goals and activities, 
and increases the probability that the group will respond to change.
Dysfunctional Conflict Conflict that hinders group performance is destructive 
or dysfunctional conflict.
8 A highly personal struggle for control in a team that 
distracts from the task at hand is dysfunctional. Exhibit 14-1 provides an overview 
depicting the effect of levels of conflict. This form of conflict has clear detrimen￾tal effects on interpersonal dynamics, fosters negative emotions (e.g., anger, frus￾tration, annoyance), and seeks to divide rather than unite toward a common goal.
Types of Conflict
One means of understanding conflict is to identify the type of disagreement, or 
what the conflict is about. Is it a disagreement about goals? Is it about people 
who just do not get along well with one another? Or is it about the best way to get 
things done? Although each conflict is unique, researchers have classified con￾flicts into three categories: task, relationship, or process.9 Relationship conflict
focuses on interpersonal relationships. Task conflict relates to the content and 
goals of the work. Process conflict is about how the work gets done.
Relationship Conflict Studies demonstrate that relationship conflicts, at least 
in work settings, are almost always dysfunctional.10 Why? The friction and inter￾personal hostilities inherent in relationship conflicts increase interpersonal 
clashes and decrease mutual understanding. They tend to derail team processes 
by reducing the extent to which people are open to working with one another 
collaboratively toward solutions while increasing the extent to which they avoid 
and compete with one another.11 As a result, relationship conflict strongly 
depletes trust, cohesion (see the chapter on work teams), satisfaction, job atti￾tudes, and positive affect (see the chapter on emotions and mood) and can even 
lead to a reduction in organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) paired with 
an increase in deviant behavior.12 However, relationship conflict itself is only 
weakly related to how well the team performs—so it appears its most nefarious 
affects are in how it affects people psychologically and how it reduces OCBs and 
increases deviance.13 As such, of the three types, relationship conflict appears to 
be the most psychologically exhausting for workers.14
Task Conflict While scholars agree that relationship conflict is dysfunctional, 
there is considerably less agreement about whether task and process conflict is 
functional. Early research suggested that task conflict within groups correlated 
functional conflict Conflict that supports 
the goals of the group and improves its 
performance.
dysfunctional conflict Conflict that hinders 
group performance.
relationship conflict Conflict based on 
interpersonal relationships.
task conflict Conflict over content and 
goals of the work.
process conflict Conflict over how work 
gets done.
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 479 21/12/22 7:05 AM480 PART 3 The Group
to higher group performance, but a review of ninety-five studies found that task 
conflict was essentially unrelated to group performance (although it did appear 
to be correlated to lower group performance in non-management positions, and 
higher group performance in decision-making teams).15 Despite these findings, 
research suggests that task conflict slightly reduces the extent to which people 
collaborate and moderately increases the degree to which they compete with 
one another.16 This, in turn, has a strong negative effect on their trust and job 
attitudes; and like relationship conflict, leads to a reduction in OCBs paired 
with an increase in deviant behavior.17
Process Conflict Process conflicts are often about delegation and roles. Conflicts 
over delegation often revolve around the perception of some members as 
shirking, and conflicts over roles can leave some group members feeling mar￾ginalized. Thus, process conflicts often become highly personalized and quickly 
devolve into relationship conflicts. It is also true, of course, that arguing about 
how to do something takes time away from actually doing it. Although relatively 
less research has been conducted on process conflict, research suggests that it

has a strong negative effect on team member trust and attitudes as well as a weak 
effect on team performance (like that of relationship conflict).18
Complicating Conflict It also appears to matter whether other types of conflict 
occur at the same time. If task and relationship conflict occur together, task 
conflict is more likely to have a negative effect, whereas if task conflict occurs 
by itself, it is more likely to have a positive effect.19 How often does this occur 
in practice? Research from one entrepreneurial venture suggests that although 
the two are initially co-occurring, over time, they tend to stabilize after some 
time.20 This suggests that one might expect relationship and task conflict to 
co-occur at the beginning of the relationship. Even the mere perception of rela￾tionship conflict during task conflict is enough to cause people to hold on to 
their initial preferences regarding the task conflict.21
Other scholars have argued that the perception of conflict is important. If 
task conflict is perceived as being very low, people are not really engaged or 
addressing the important issues; if task conflict is too high, infighting will quickly 
degenerate into relationship conflict. Moderate levels of task conflict may thus 
be optimal.22 Furthermore, who perceives conflict also matters. Incompatibilities 
between work styles or dominating personalities with little space for compromise 
can lead to “too many cooks in the kitchen,” resulting in relationship conflict 
and even abusive supervision.23 Research suggests that conflict is more likely to 
have a positive effect on performance when a few members perceive strong task 
disagreement and most others on the team perceive weak task disagreement. 
This is because those of the minority opinion are much more likely to present 
their disagreements in a careful, cooperative, open manner.24
Loci of Conflict
Another way to understand conflict is to consider its locus, or where the con￾flict occurs among people. Here, there are three basic types. Dyadic conflict is 
conflict between two people. Intragroup conflict occurs within a group or team. 
Intergroup conflict is conflict between groups or teams.25
Nearly all the research on conflict focuses on intragroup conflict (within 
the group). However, it does not necessarily tell us all we need to know about 
the contingencies on conflict. For example, research has found that for intra￾group task conflict to influence performance within the team, it is important 
that the team has a supportive climate in which mistakes are not penalized and 
every team member “[has] the other’s back.”26 Similarly, the personal needs of 
group members may determine when task conflict has a positive impact on per￾formance. For instance, task conflict can be beneficial for performance when 
members are high on the need for achievement.27
But is this concept applicable to the effects of intergroup conflict? For a group 
to adapt and improve, perhaps a certain amount of intragroup conflict (but not 
too much) is good for team performance, especially when the team members sup￾port one another. For instance, Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs (players for the NFL 
football team the Buffalo Bills) are known to have a great relationship on and off 
the field. At the same time, they are very competitive with one another in training, 
during practice, and even playing video games like Call of Duty.
28
But would we care whether members from one NFL team were in conflict 
with members from another team? Probably not. In fact, if groups are compet￾ing with one another so that only one team can “win,” interteam conflict seems 
almost inevitable, and rivalries often sprout between players. For instance, 
friendly rivalries between Josh Allen and other players like Sam Darnold 
and Patrick Mahomes have even led to proposed throwing competitions, or 
“throw-offs.”29

M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 481 21/12/22 7:05 AM482 PART 3 The Group
Still, it must be managed. Intense intergroup conflict can be quite straining 
on relationships between people and might well affect the way they interact. For 
instance, The Ohio State University and University of Michigan rivalry, although 
oftentimes friendly and well intentioned, has resulted in ostracism, verbal deni￾gration, riots, and even threatened violence at times between fans.30 In fact, 
many attribute the rivalry itself to several violent border conflicts between Ohio 
and Michigan in the 1800s.31
It may surprise you that a person’s status and power (see the previous 
chapter on power and politics) become even more important during intergroup 
conflicts, but not in the way you might guess. One study that focused on inter￾group conflict found an interplay between an individual’s position within a 
group and the way that individual managed conflict between groups. Group 
members who were relatively peripheral in their own group networks were better 
at resolving conflicts between their group and another one.32 Thus, being at the 
core of your work group does not necessarily make you the best person to man￾age conflict with other groups.
Altogether, functional and dysfunctional conflict requires not only that 
we identify the type of conflict; we also need to know where it occurs. It is 
possible that while the concepts of task, relationship, and process conflict are 
useful in understanding intragroup or even dyadic conflict, they are less useful 
in explaining the effects of intergroup conflict. But how do we navigate and 
manage the experience of conflict when it occurs? A better understanding of 
the conflict process, discussed next, will provide insight about potential control￾lable variables.
The Conflict Process
The conflict process has five stages: potential opposition or incompatibility, 
cognition and personalization, intentions, behavior, and outcomes (see Exhibit 
14-2).33
Under the leadership of George 
Zimmer, the founder and CEO of 
Men’s Warehouse (MW) and its adver￾tising spokesperson, the retailer grew 
into a multimillion-dollar firm with 
1,450 stores. After retiring as CEO, 
Zimmer served as executive chairman 
of MW’s board until an intragroup 
conflict between him and other mem￾bers resulted in his removal from the 
board.

Stage I: Potential Opposition or Incompatibility
The first stage of conflict is the appearance of conditions—causes or sources—
that create opportunities for it to arise.34 These conditions need not lead directly 
to conflict, but one of them is necessary if it is to surface. Apart from the obvi￾ous, which would be behaviors directly intended to provoke conflict,35 we group 
the conditions into three general categories: communication, structure, and 
personal variables.
Communication Suri had worked in supply chain management at 3M for three 
years. Suri enjoyed the job largely because the manager, Aang, was a great 
supervisor. Then Aang was promoted and Rumra took the open position. Six 
months later, Suri now finds the job frustrating. “Aang and I were on the same 
wavelength. It’s not that way with Rumra. Rumra tells me something, I do it, and 
then Rumra tells me I did it wrong. I think Rumra means one thing but says 
something else. It has been like this since day one. I do not think a day goes by 
without Rumra yelling at me or chastising me for something. You know, there 
are some people you just find it easy to communicate with. Well, Rumra is not 
one of those!”
Suri’s comments illustrate that communication can be a source of conflict 
in dyadic and group interactions.36 This experience represents the opposing 
forces that arise from miscommunication (see the earlier chapter on communi￾cation). Barriers to communication, including communication apprehension, 
crisis situations, and cross-cultural differences in norms, may be potential ante￾cedent conditions to conflict. The potential for conflict has also been found 
to increase with too little or too much communication. Communication is func￾tional up to a point, after which it is possible to overcommunicate, increasing 
the potential for conflict. Even the way communication is framed can have an 
effect: For example, framing task conflict as a debate increases receptivity to 
others’ opinions.37
Structure Armani is a salesperson and Jaylen is the company credit manager at 
Furniture Mart, a large discount furniture retailer in St. Cloud, Minnesota. The 
two have known each other for years and have much in common: They live two 
blocks apart, and their oldest children attend the same middle school and are 
best friends. If Armani and Jaylen had different jobs, they might be friends, but 
at work they constantly disagree. Armani’s job is to sell furniture and do it well.

Most of these sales are made on credit. Because Jaylen’s job is to minimize credit 
losses, Jaylen regularly has to turn down the credit applications of Armani’s cus￾tomers. It is nothing personal between the two; the requirements of their jobs 
just bring them into conflict.
The conflicts between Armani and Jaylen are structural in nature. The term 
structure in this context includes variables such as the size of the group, degree 
of specialization in tasks assigned to group members, role clarity, member–goal 
compatibility, leadership styles, reward systems, and degree of dependence 
between groups or group members. The larger the group and the more special￾ized its activities, the greater the likelihood of intragroup conflict. Tenure and 
conflict are inversely related, meaning that the longer a person stays with an 
organization, the less likely intragroup conflict becomes.38 Furthermore, shared 
leadership (see the chapter on leadership) can lead to conflict when power is 
scarce, causing people to “fight over their power turfs.”39 Therefore, the poten￾tial for intragroup conflict is greatest when group members are younger and 
when turnover is high. However, as far as intergroup conflict is concerned, it 
can self-perpetuate, actually imbuing meaning and identity to the groups experi￾encing conflict.40
Personal Variables Charlie and Morgan both work at the Pepsi bottling 
plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Although initially the two seemed 
to get along very well, the two were sitting in the break room watching the 
news one day in November. As it was an election year, a political ad came 
up for the Senate seat that was available. Morgan made a comment about 
how it was absolutely imperative that the Republicans must be booted from 
office and that it was “a long time coming.” Charlie took major issue with 
this comment as a Republican, and a heated, incendiary argument followed. 
The difference in political affiliation can be sensed by the rest of the team, 
and their coordination and collaboration have been severely affected by this 
new knowledge.
Our last category of potential sources of conflict is personal variables, which 
include personality, emotions, and values. People high in the personality traits 
of disagreeableness, neuroticism, or self-monitoring (see the chapter on per￾sonality and individual differences) are prone to spar with other people more 
often—and to react poorly when conflicts occur.41 On the other hand, the polit￾ically skilled are less likely to initiate conflict as they are better able to manage 
others’ perceptions.42
Emotions can cause conflict even when they are not directed at others. 
For example, an employee who shows up to work irate from the hectic morn￾ing commute may carry that anger into the workday, which can result in a 
tension-filled meeting.43 Employees not sharing or experiencing the same 
emotions can also engender conflict. For example, employees may experience 
more conflict when they are pessimistic about a task and their supervisors 
are more optimistic.44 As depicted in the example concerning Charlie and 
Morgan, values can often conflict with one another and cause emotionally 
charged conflict.
Furthermore, differences in preferences and values can generate higher 
levels of conflict. When group members do not agree about their desired 
achievement levels, there is more of an opportunity for task conflict; when 
group members do not agree about their desired interpersonal closeness, there 
is more opportunity for relationship conflict; and when group members do not 
have similar desires for power, there is more opportunity for conflict over sta￾tus.45 People differ with regard to their beliefs about conflict and which strate￾gies of managing conflict are the best or worst; these beliefs shape the types of 
conflict they perceive as well as how they react.46

Stage II: Cognition and Personalization
If the conditions cited in Stage I negatively affect something one party cares 
about, then the potential for opposition or incompatibility becomes actualized 
in the second stage.
As we noted in our introduction to the chapter, conflict is a perception. 
However, just because a disagreement is a perceived conflict does not mean it 
is personalized. Instead, it can become felt conflict, where individuals become 
emotionally involved, potentially experiencing anxiety, tension, frustration, or 
hostility.
Stage II is important because it is where conflict issues tend to be defined, 
where the parties decide what the conflict is about.47 For example, the employee 
who was irate from the traffic jam may cause others around the office to per￾ceive that something is up—but this conflict is not “felt” until a sour interaction 
with this employee (e.g., “It is not fair the supervisor took the long commute 
out on me with extra work!”). Moreover, emotions play a major role in shaping 
perceptions.48 Negative emotions lead us to oversimplify issues, lose trust, and 
put negative interpretations on the other party’s behavior.49 When you perceive 
conflict, sometimes you may turn to a confidant within your group to vent or talk 
about what you are feeling. Paradoxically, if this person is responsive and reaf￾firming, your confidant may validate your perspective, which might undermine 
the resolution of conflict as a result.50 In contrast, positive feelings increase our 
tendency to see potential relationships among elements of a problem, take a 
broader view of the situation, and develop innovative solutions.51
Negative emotions are natural and perhaps inevitable—before conflict esca￾lates, taking time to reflect and reappraise how you are feeling may help you 
approach the conflict more constructively (but don’t ruminate!).52 Ultimately, 
a state of mindfulness (see the chapter on health and stress) might be a 
good emotional state to aspire toward, given it facilitates constructive conflict 
management.53
Stage III: Intentions
Intentions intervene between people’s perceptions and emotions, and their 
overt behavior. They are decisions to act in a particular way.54 Although we may 
decide to act in a certain way, our intentions do not always line up with what 
we actually do. Furthermore, intentions are not always fixed. During a conflict, 
intentions might change if a party is able to see the other’s point of view or to 
respond emotionally to the other’s behavior.
We can think of conflict-handling intentions as falling along two dimensions 
(as depicted in Exhibit 14-3).55 These two dimensions—assertiveness (the degree 
to which one party attempts to satisfy their own concerns) and cooperativeness
(the degree to which one party attempts to satisfy the other party’s concerns)—
can help us identify five conflict-handling intentions (also known as the Thomas 
Kilmann conflict modes): competing (assertive and uncooperative), collaborating
(assertive and cooperative), avoiding (unassertive and uncooperative), accom￾modating (unassertive and cooperative), and compromising (midrange on both 
assertiveness and cooperativeness).56
Competing When one person seeks to satisfy their own interests regardless 
of the impact on the other parties in the conflict, that person is competing.57
We are more apt to compete when resources are scarce, when we have 
competition-prone personalities, when we are close to satisfying our own inter￾ests (e.g., the “finish line is near”), or when the culture or climate supports 
competition.58
perceived conflict Awareness by one or 
more parties of the existence of or conditions 
that create opportunities for conflict.
felt conflict Emotional involvement in 
a conflict that creates anxiety, tenseness, 
frustration, or hostility.
competing A desire to satisfy one’s 
interests, regardless of the impact on the 
other party to the conflict.
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 485 21/12/22 7:05 AM486 PART 3 The Group
Collaborating When parties in conflict each desire to fully satisfy the concerns 
of all parties, there is cooperation and a search for a mutually beneficial out￾come. In collaborating, parties intend to solve a problem by clarifying differ￾ences rather than by accommodating various points of view.59 If you attempt to 
find a win–win solution that allows both parties’ goals to be completely achieved, 
that is collaborating. Collaboration is more likely if the party is seen as compe￾tent, rational, and open to collaborating.60
Avoiding A person may recognize that a conflict exists and want to withdraw 
from or suppress it. Examples of avoiding include trying to ignore a conflict 
and keeping away from others with whom you disagree. If you are already over￾loaded as it is, but your supervisor keeps trying to involve you in more projects 
and assign you more tasks at work, you may avoid initiating conversations with 
them. Typically, avoidance takes two emotion-driven forms: withdrawal and exit 
(e.g., leaving a conversation with another person; usually driven by annoyance) 
and silence (e.g., not starting a conversation with another person; usually driven 
by anxiety).61
Accommodating A party who seeks to appease the other party may be willing to 
place the other’s interests above their own, sacrificing to maintain the relation￾ship. We refer to this intention as accommodating. Supporting someone else’s 
opinion despite your reservations about it, for example, is accommodating.
Compromising In compromising, there is no winner or loser. Rather, there is 
a willingness to rationalize the object of the conflict and accept a solution with 
incomplete satisfaction of both parties’ concerns. The distinguishing character￾istic of compromising therefore is that each party intends to give up something.
collaborating A situation in which the 
parties involved in a conflict all desire to fully 
satisfy the concerns of all parties.
avoiding The desire to withdraw from or 
suppress a conflict.
accommodating The willingness of one 
party in a conflict to place the opponent’s 
interests above their own.
compromising A situation in which each 
party to a conflict is willing to give up 
something to resolve the conflict.

A review that examined the effects of the intentions across multiple studies 
found that accommodating and collaborating were both associated with supe￾rior group performance, whereas avoiding and competing strategies were asso￾ciated with significantly worse group performance.62 These effects were nearly 
as large as the effects of relationship conflict. Collaboration may be especially 
effective for tasks that require innovation, but it can lead to mistrust and con￾flict when groups are splintered into smaller groups of two or three based on 
task.63 Individuals who have been assigned power tend to have a more difficult 
time using collaborative strategies.64 This further demonstrates that it is not just 
the existence of conflict or even the type of conflict that creates problems but 
rather the ways people respond to conflict and manage the process once con￾flicts arise.
Stage IV: Behavior
When most people think of conflict, they tend to focus on Stage IV because 
this is where conflicts become visible. The behavior stage includes statements, 
actions, and reactions made by conflicting parties, usually as overt attempts 
to implement their own intentions. As a result of miscalculations or unskilled 
enactments, overt behaviors sometimes deviate from original intentions.65
Intentions that are brought into a conflict are likely to be translated into behav￾iors. Competing brings out active attempts to contend with team members and 
more individual effort to achieve ends without working together. Collaborating
creates investigation of multiple solutions with other members of the team and 
trying to find a solution that satisfies all parties as much as possible. Avoidance
is seen in behavior as refusals to discuss issues and reductions in effort toward 
group goals. People who accommodate put their relationships ahead of the issues 
in the conflict, deferring to others’ opinions and sometimes acting as a sub￾group with them. When people compromise, they both expect to and do sacrifice 
parts of their interests, hoping that if everyone does the same, an agreement will 
emerge.
Stage IV is a dynamic process of interaction. For example, you make a 
demand on me, I respond by arguing with you, you shout at me, I yell back, 
and so on. Exhibit 14-4 provides a way of visualizing conflict behavior. Each 
behavioral stage in a conflict is built upon a foundation. At the lowest point 
are perceptions, misunderstandings, and differences of opinions. These may 
grow to subtle, indirect, and highly controlled forms of tension, such as a stu￾dent challenging a point the instructor has made. Conflict can intensify until

it becomes highly destructive. Strikes, riots, and wars clearly fall in this upper 
range. Conflicts that reach the upper ranges of the continuum are almost always 
dysfunctional. Functional conflicts are typically confined to the lower levels.
Stage V: Outcomes
The action–reaction interplay between conflicting parties creates conse￾quences. As our model demonstrates (see Exhibit 14-1), these outcomes may be 
functional if the conflict improves the group’s performance, or dysfunctional 
if it hinders performance. Realistically, however, many researchers suggest that 
although workplace conflict can be beneficial, it is usually under special circum￾stances, and most of the time the dysfunctional outcomes outweigh the func￾tional outcomes in severity.66 This suggests that managers will likely spend most 
of their time reducing dysfunctional conflict rather than stimulating functional 
conflict.
Functional Outcomes How might conflict act as a force to increase group per￾formance? It is hard to visualize a situation in which agitated aggression could 
be functional. But it is possible to see how low or moderate levels of conflict 
could improve group effectiveness and creativity. Conflict is constructive when it 
improves the quality of decisions, stimulates creativity and innovation, encourages 
interest and curiosity among group members, provides the medium for problems 
to be aired and tensions released, and fosters self-evaluation and change. Indeed, 
over time, the right amount of task conflict (not relational conflict) can cause 
teams to improve their relations, the quality of social interaction, and meaning￾ful communication.67 Mild conflicts also may generate energizing emotions, so 
IBM encourages employees to en￾gage in functional conflict that results 
in innovations, such as the Watson 
supercomputer designed to learn 
through the same process human 
brains use. For innovation to flourish, 
IBM relies on the creative tension 
from employees’ different ideas and 
skills and provides a work environ￾ment that promotes risk taking and 
outside-the-box thinking.

members of groups become more active, energized, and engaged in their work.68
However, groups that are extremely polarized do not manage their underlying 
disagreements effectively and tend to accept suboptimal solutions, or they avoid 
making decisions altogether rather than work out the conflict.69 As mentioned 
earlier in this chapter, conflict severity plays a large role.
Dysfunctional Outcomes The destructive consequences of conflict on the perfor￾mance of a group or an organization are generally well known: A substantial body 
of research documents how dysfunctional conflicts can reduce group effective￾ness.70 Among the undesirable consequences are poor communication, reduc￾tions in group cohesiveness, and subordination of group goals to the primacy of 
infighting among members. All forms of conflict—even the functional varieties—
appear to reduce group member satisfaction and trust.71 At the extreme, conflict 
can bring group functioning to a halt and threaten the group’s survival.
Managing Conflict
If a conflict is dysfunctional, what can the parties do to deescalate it? Or, conversely, 
what options exist if conflict is too low to be functional and needs to be increased? 
In these situations, people can use resolution and stimulation techniques to 
achieve the desired level of conflict, a process known as conflict management.
72
At a broader level, executives try to manage conflict proactively by developing con￾flict management systems of policies and procedures, increase lower-level manage￾ment’s involvement in conflict management, socialize dysfunctional conflict out 
of the organization’s culture, and improvise where needed to adapt to conflict 
management needs.73 In anticipating and managing conflict, organizations can 
target three specific domains: strategy (e.g., designing conflict management activi￾ties with an understanding of their effect on the organization system, garnering 
managerial support for and application of conflict management strategies), func￾tion (e.g., encouraging the systemic adoption of conflict management practices, 
understanding employees’ needs, job design to reduce conflict), and worker (e.g., 
improving employee perceptions of conflict, fostering ties and cohesion between 
people, adaptively addressing conflict as it emerges).74 For example, if the conflict 
is expected to be perpetual and ongoing, a strategic conflict management strategy 
might not target resolving the conflict completely, but rather how people can adap￾tively address the conflict over time.75 At a narrower level, leaders manage conflict 
in three primary ways: instigation (i.e., intentionally creating conflict when needed), 
engagement (i.e., escalating conflict, involving others, or strategically observing), and 
managing (i.e., handling or resolving conflict).76
Even with the number of ways in which conflict can be managed, there 
are some practical guidelines for managers to implement conflict manage￾ment more effectively. First, one of the keys to minimizing counterproduc￾tive conflicts is recognizing when there really is a disagreement. Perhaps the 
most successful conflict management recognizes different views and attempts 
to resolve them by encouraging open, frank discussion, listening and under￾standing opposing views, and then integrating them constructively.77 Another 
approach is to have opposing groups pick parts of the solution that are most 
important to them and then focus on how each side can get its top needs 
satisfied. Neither side may get exactly what it wants, but each side will achieve 
the most important parts of its agenda.78 Third, groups that resolve conflicts 
successfully discuss differences of opinion openly and are prepared to man￾age conflict when it arises.79 The most disruptive conflicts are those that are 
never addressed directly. An open discussion makes it much easier to develop 
a shared perception of the problems at hand; it also allows groups to work 
toward a mutually acceptable solution. Fourth, managers need to emphasize 
conflict management The use of resolution 
and stimulation techniques to achieve the 
desired level of conflict.
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 489 21/12/22 7:05 AM490 PART 3 The Group
shared interests in resolving conflicts so groups that disagree with one another 
do not become too entrenched in their points of view and start to take the con￾flicts personally. Groups with cooperative conflict styles and a strong underly￾ing identification with the overall group goals are more effective than groups 
with a competitive style.80
However, conditions are not always ideal, and the findings from research on 
conflict management showed marked differences in effectiveness across situa￾tions.81 First, strategies appropriate for resolving one form of conflict may back￾fire and cause more conflict in another area.82 For example, adopting a shared 
identity, resolving relationship quality, may unintentionally backfire by causing 
blurred distinctions between people’s roles, stimulating task conflict. Second, 
strategies appropriate for managing one form of conflict may spill over into 
another domain.83 For example, clearly outlining differences in what people 
do in the presence of task conflict can spill over to stimulate relational conflict. 
The fluid, abstract nature of conflict has led many researchers to analyze con￾flict management through a strategic systems view, viewing conflict as a chain of 
events wrought with various thoughts, emotions, and motivations. Taking such 
a view can enable managers to approach conflict from a more flexible, adaptive 
perspective.84
Cross-Cultural Conflict Management Differences across countries in conflict 
resolution strategies may be based on differences in cultural values (see the 
chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations). Collectivist cul￾tures see people as deeply embedded in connective social networks, whereas 
individualist cultures see them as autonomous and independent. As a result, 
collectivists are more likely to seek to preserve relationships and promote the 
good of the group as a whole. They avoid the direct expression of conflict, pre￾ferring indirect methods for resolving differences of opinion. Collectivists may 
also be more interested in demonstrations of concern and working through 
third parties to resolve disputes, whereas individualists are more likely to con￾front differences of opinion directly and openly. For example, compared to 
collectivist negotiators, their more individualist counterparts are more likely 
to see offers as unfair and reject them. Another study revealed that, whereas 
individualist managers were more likely to use competing tactics in the face 
of conflicts, compromising and avoiding were the most preferred methods of 
conflict management by collectivists.85 Interview data suggest, however, that 
top management teams in collectivist high-technology firms prefer collabora￾tion even more than compromising and avoiding.86
Cross-cultural negotiations can lead to trust issues.87 One study of Indian 
and U.S. negotiators found that respondents reported having less trust in their 
cross-culture negotiation counterparts. The lower level of trust was associated 
with less discovery of common interests between parties, which occurred because 
cross-culture negotiators were less willing to disclose and solicit information.88
Another study found that both U.S. and Chinese negotiators tended to have 
an ingroup bias, which led them to favor negotiating partners from their own 
cultures. For Chinese negotiators, this was particularly true when accountability 
requirements were high.89
Having considered conflict—its nature, causes, and consequences—we now 
turn to negotiation, which often resolves conflict.
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 490 21/12/22 7:05 AMConflict and Negotiation CHAPTER 14 491
Negotiation
Negotiation permeates the interactions of almost everyone in groups and orga￾nizations. There is the obvious: Labor bargains with management. There is the 
not-so-obvious: Managers negotiate with employees, peers, and bosses; salespeo￾ple negotiate with customers; purchasing agents negotiate with suppliers. And 
there is the subtle: An employee agrees to cover for a colleague for a few min￾utes in exchange for a future favor. In today’s loosely structured organizations, 
in which members work with colleagues in self-managed teams over whom they 
have no direct authority and with whom they may not even share a common 
supervisor, negotiation skills are critical.
We can define negotiation as a process that occurs when two or more par￾ties communicate and confer with one another to come to a mutual agreement 
on the exchange of goods or services.90 Although we commonly think of the 
outcomes of negotiation in one-shot transactional terms, like negotiating over 
one’s salary before accepting a job offer, every negotiation in organizations also 
affects the relationship between negotiators and the way negotiators feel about 
themselves.91 Depending on how much the parties are going to interact with 
one another, sometimes maintaining the social relationship and behaving ethi￾cally will be just as important as achieving an immediate outcome of bargaining. 
(Note that we use the terms negotiation and bargaining interchangeably.)
Bargaining Strategies
There are two general approaches to negotiation—distributive bargaining and 
integrative bargaining.92 As Exhibit 14-5 shows, they differ in their goals and moti￾vation, focus, interests, information sharing, and duration of relationship. Let 
us define each and illustrate the differences.
Distributive Bargaining Your team was not aware of a change in policy until it was 
already happening.93 This policy meant that your team would receive 20 percent

more parties communicate and confer with 
one another to come to a mutual agreement 
on the exchange of goods or services.

less resources next fiscal year. There is nothing you can do to stop the policy from 
being implemented, so you negotiate with the executive team regarding these 
provisions. Both parties believe that any gain is made at the other’s expense, 
and when you try to negotiate halving this reduction in resources, the executives 
counter with an offer of 15 percent. The negotiating strategy you are engaging 
in is called distributive bargaining. Its identifying feature is that it operates under 
zero-sum conditions (see the chapter on power and politics)—that is, any gain I 
make is at your expense, and vice versa. The essence of distributive bargaining is 
negotiating over who gets what share of a fixed pie. By fixed pie, we mean a set 
amount of goods or services to be divvied up. When the pie is fixed, or the parties 
believe it is, they tend to engage in distributive bargaining.
The essence of distributive bargaining is depicted in Exhibit 14-6. Parties A
and B represent two negotiators. Each has a target point that defines what they 
would like to achieve. Each also has a resistance point, which marks the lowest 
acceptable outcome—the point beyond which the party would break off nego￾tiations rather than accept a less favorable settlement. The area between these 
two points makes up each party’s aspiration range. As long as there is some over￾lap between A’s and B’s aspiration ranges, there exists a settlement range in 
which each one’s aspirations can be met.
First Offer Anchoring When you are engaged in distributive bargaining, you 
may want to consider making the first offer. Making the first offer can put 
you at an advantage because of the anchoring bias, mentioned in the chapter 
on perception and decision making. People tend to fixate on initial informa￾tion. Once that anchoring point has been set, they fail to adequately adjust it 
based on subsequent information. A savvy negotiator sets an anchor with the 
initial offer, and scores of negotiation studies show that such anchors greatly 
favor the person who sets them.94 Moreover, these initial offer anchors are 
more effective the more precise they are because it changes the other party’s 
perception of the negotiable range.95 For instance, if you make a first offer 
for a service contract of $50,000, the purchasing party would be more likely to 
consider a range of, say, $40,000 to $60,000. However, if you are more precise 
and ask for $51,000, they are much more likely to consider a range of $50,000 
to $52,000.
If you have a negotiation partner who is motivated to maximize their own 
return, a disadvantage of making the first offer is that you are conveying 
information about your priorities that the individual can use against you.96
Furthermore, framing matters: If you frame the first proposal as a request (i.e., I 
request your B for my A) instead of an offer (i.e., I offer my A for your B), it can 
be detrimental to your negotiation success by highlighting a “loss” rather than 
a “gain” for the negotiation partner.97 Another disadvantage to precision is that

if you make a precise offer before negotiations were even entered by both par￾ties, the other party may be less likely to negotiate with you (because they may 
perceive you as inflexible).98
Distributive Bargaining Strategy In distributive bargaining, should you engage 
in hardline strategies in which you minimize your own concessions and make 
extreme offers, or should you engage in softline strategies, where you elicit con￾cessions from the other party through your own concessions? One review sug￾gests that it depends on the outcome you want: If it is important to preserve 
the relationship, softline strategies might be better.99 If you want a higher eco￾nomic return, than hardline strategies might be better. When is each strategy 
most effective? The hardline approach tends to be most effective if you are 
physically interacting with the other negotiator, when the other party is male, 
when both are motivated to maximize individual outcomes, and when they 
know what they can and cannot bargain (although people’s perception of the 
bargaining zone itself is often distorted).100 The softline approach is more effec￾tive only when you are able to adequately give concessions to the other party. 
Furthermore, some research suggests that phantom anchors (e.g., “I was going to 
ask for $10,000, but since you are making that concession, I will offer you $8,000 
instead) can be an effective softline strategy that communicates your concession 
(even if the concession is overstated).101
Another soft tactic that builds upon the first offer effect mentioned earlier is 
the use of multiple equivalent simultaneous offers (MESOs). MESOs involve present￾ing multiple, equivalent first offers to the negotiating partner to choose from. 
This may lead the negotiation partner to perceive the offeror as flexible and 
sincerely trying to reach an agreement as well as increase the likelihood of the 
negotiation partner finding an option they like right away.102 Moreover, when 
one of these alternative attractive offers is no longer available, the negotiator 
becomes more assertive and engaged in the negotiation process (having expe￾rienced loss) and is therefore positioned to obtain better outcomes, although 
they might be less satisfied with the process.103
Distributive Bargaining in Career Management So what does what we know about 
distributive negotiation mean for your career? Say that you have a job offer, and 
your prospective employer asks you what sort of starting salary you want. Now is 
the chance to direct the conversation and make your case—you have an oppor￾tunity to set the anchor, meaning you should ask for the highest salary you think 
the employer could reasonably offer. Asking for a million dollars is only going to 
make most of us look ridiculous, which is why we suggest being on the high end 
of what you think is reasonable. Too often, we err on the side of caution, afraid of 
scaring off the employer and thus settling for far too little. It is possible to scare 
off an employer, and it is true employers do not like candidates to be too asser￾tive in salary negotiations.104 What happens much more often is that we ask for 
less than we could have obtained. So, when moving into a salary negotiation, be 
sure to go in with the knowledge of industry salary rates and trends, build your 
case prior to the discussion if possible, and do not make it all about you—make 
it about the value you are providing to the company.105
Integrative Bargaining During her first pregnancy, one woman who worked full 
time for the federal government knew that she wanted to reduce her hours so she 
could spend more time with her child.106 She did her research on the policies 
and procedures for part-time work to see how she might be able to make it hap￾pen. She went to her supervisor and discussed possibilities for a part-time work 
arrangement and was able to successfully negotiate for this arrangement. This 
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 493 21/12/22 7:05 AM494 PART 3 The Group
employee’s attitude shows the promise of integrative bargaining. In contrast to 
distributive bargaining, integrative bargaining assumes that one or more of the 
possible settlements can create a win–win solution rather than a zero-sum situa￾tion. Of course, all parties must be engaged for integrative bargaining to work. 
This appears to be more of a possibility in negotiations between multiple (rather 
than two) negotiators because two people are more likely to see things in terms 
of binary, win–lose trade-offs.107 Moreover, technique also appears to be impor￾tant in integrative bargaining. Research shows that silent pauses in between offers 
and counteroffers communicates to others that you are considering what they are 
proposing, deliberately thinking about what they offer, and working with them to 
create value for all parties.108
Exhibit 14-7 illustrates how the two bargaining strategies can be utilized 
within the same negotiation episode. Early on in the episode, integrative strate￾gies can be used, while later in the episode, distributive strategies can be used. 
Continuing with the previous example, the employee could first clarify her needs 
and articulate her interests to the supervisor and the supervisor would do the 
same, all without trying to come to a compromise right away. If a compromise is 
reached too early, it is more likely that one or more of the parties would settle for 
integrative bargaining Negotiation that 
seeks one or more settlements that can 
create a win–win solution.

less than they could have obtained if they had been forced to consider the other 
party’s interests, trade off issues, and be creative.109 For example, the employee 
could have prematurely agreed to a half-day off a week. However, if both parties 
discussed what they wanted (e.g., the employer only wanted the employee to be 
working during a core time during the week and would be fine with flexibility 
outside that core time, as long as she worked the full hours), she could have been 
able to secure a much more attractive, flexible schedule. Similarly, it is important 
not to walk away too soon or cave into the negotiation partner’s ultimatum—
persisting through the process can pay off in better negotiation outcomes.110
Once all of the needs and interests are established for both parties, the super￾visor could then switch to a distributive strategy, setting goals aligned with the 
company’s needs and interests while attempting to maximize the extent to which 
both parties’ goals are met.
Choosing Bargaining Methods Integrative bargaining is preferable to distributive bar￾gaining because the former builds long-term relationships.111 Integrative bargaining 
bonds negotiators and allows them to leave the bargaining table feeling they have 
achieved a victory. Distributive bargaining, however, can result in one party feeling 
like they lost the negotiation. It tends to build animosity and deepen divisions when 
people must work together on an ongoing basis. Research shows that over repeated 
bargaining episodes, a losing party who feels positively about the negotiation outcome 
is much more likely to bargain cooperatively in subsequent negotiations.
Why, then, do we not see more integrative bargaining in organizations? The 
answer lies in the conditions necessary for it to succeed. Evidence from a study 
of nearly 200,000 people found that the financially vulnerable are more likely 
to construe the negotiation in zero-sum terms, curtailing their ability to come 
to integrative solutions.112 Furthermore, negotiating parties who are open with 
information and candid about concerns, are sensitive to the other’s needs and 
trust, and maintain flexibility tend to foster integrative bargaining. Although 
more traditional organizations may not foster these conditions, organizations 
with psychologically safe, open environments with positive cultures and climates 
and negotiating partners with integrative mindsets may perhaps do so.
The Negotiation Process
Exhibit 14-8 provides a simplified model of the negotiation process. It views 
negotiation as composed of five steps: (1) preparation and planning, (2) defi￾nition of ground rules, (3) clarification and justification, (4) bargaining and 
problem solving, and (5) closure and implementation.113
Preparation and Planning
This may be the most important part of the process. Before you start negotiat￾ing, do your homework. What is the history leading up to this negotiation? Who 
is involved, and what are their perceptions of the situation? Then consider your 
goals, in writing, with a range of outcomes from “most helpful” to “minimally 
acceptable.” If you are a supply manager at Apple, for instance, and your goal is 
to get a significant cost reduction from your telecom components supplier (e.g., 
Qualcomm), make sure this goal stays paramount in discussions and does not get 
overshadowed by other issues. Next, assess what you think are the other party’s 
goals. What intangible or hidden interests may be important to them? On what 
might they be willing to settle? Think carefully about what the other side might be 
willing to give up. People who underestimate their opponent’s willingness to give 
on key issues before the negotiation even starts end up with lower outcomes.114
14-4 Apply the five steps of 
the negotiation process.
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 495 21/12/22 7:05 AM496 PART 3 The Group
When you can anticipate your negotiation partner’s position, you are better 
equipped to counter arguments with facts and figures that support your position.
Once you have gathered your information, develop a strategy. You should deter￾mine your and the other side’s best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA). 
Your BATNA determines the lowest value acceptable to you for a negotiated agree￾ment. Any offer you receive that is higher than your BATNA is better than an 
impasse. Conversely, you should not expect success in your negotiation effort unless 
you are able to make the other side an offer it finds more attractive than its BATNA.
In nearly all cases, the party with superior alternatives will do bet￾ter in a negotiation, so experts advise negotiators to solidify their BATNA 
prior to any interaction.115 There is an interesting exception to this general 
rule—-negotiators with absolutely no alternative to a negotiated agreement 
sometimes “go for broke” because they do not even consider what would 
happen if the negotiation falls through.116 Even though they are a safe￾guard against an inferior agreement, they are not a way to reach the optimal 
agreement—some suggest that although it is good to have this information ahead 
of time, you should focus on your mutual dependence (not alternatives) and posi￾tively frame the way you think about the negotiation (e.g., a learning experience 
with hidden potential, not a “frightening minefield”).117 Furthermore, just as 
phantom anchors are possible, so are phantom BATNAs. Setting a BATNA before 
a negotiation does not guarantee that the BATNA is probable or even possible. 
Those who hold a phantom BATNA may find themselves in the undesirable posi￾tion of having to accept or reject a final offer from a negotiation partner when 
their chosen BATNA was not possible to begin with.118
Definition of Ground Rules
Once you have done your planning and developed a strategy, you are ready to 
define with the other party the ground rules and procedures of the negotiation 
itself. Who will do the negotiating? Where will it take place? What time con￾straints, if any, will apply? To what issues will negotiation be limited? Will you fol￾low a specific procedure if an impasse is reached? During this phase, the parties 
will exchange their initial proposals or demands.

agreement; the least a party in a negotiation

 Clarification and Justification 
 When you have exchanged initial positions, you and the other party will explain, 
amplify, clarify, bolster, and justify your original demands. This step need not be 
confrontational. Rather, it is an opportunity for educating each other on the issues, 
why they are important, and how you arrived at your initial demands. Provide the 
other party with any documentation that supports your position. It might be useful 
to think back to what you learned in the previous chapter (power and politics) on 
influence, as framing can be important here. 
 Bargaining and Problem Solving 
 The essence of the negotiation process is the actual give-and-take in trying to 
hash out an agreement. This is where both parties need to make concessions. 
Relationships change as a result of negotiation, so take that into consideration. 
If you could “win” a negotiation but push the other side into resentment or 
animosity, it might be wiser to pursue a more compromising style. 119 As an 
example, of how the tone of a relationship in negotiations matters, people 
who feel good about the process of a job offer negotiation are more satisfied 
with their jobs and less likely to turn over a year later regardless of their actual 
outcomes from these negotiations. 120 
 Closure and Implementation 
 The final step in the negotiation process is formalizing your agreement and 
developing procedures necessary for implementing and monitoring it. 121 For 
major negotiations—from labor–management negotiations to bargaining over 
service terms—this requires hammering out the specifics in a formal contract. 
For other cases, closure of the negotiation process is nothing more formal than 
a handshake or verbal confirmation. 
 Myth or Science? 
 Good Negotiators Rely on Intuition 
 I
ntuition often fails us in negotia￾tion due to the unconscious biases 
we hold. In fact, negotiators may 
unintentionally engage in behavior that 
contradicts their values and ethical 
standards. The ethical implications of a 
decision are often apparent when one 
prepares for a negotiation. However, 
the implications of our decisions often 
fade away during the actual negotia￾tion as we become more focused on 
pragmatic concerns. As a result, the 
cognitions and biases of negotiators 
can interfere with reaching agreements 
that reflect our interests.
Researchers have studied negotia￾tors who engaged in empathizing (emo￾tionally feeling what the other party 
was feeling) and those who engaged in 
perspective taking (view the world from 
the other person’s perspective). The 
evidence indicated that individuals are 
better prepared to negotiate when they 
imagine how their counterpart is think￾ing, not how they feel.
While we are often capable of 
identifying the biases that influence 
others, we are often unaware of the 
biases that impact our behavior in 
negotiations. This disconnect can be 
explained by what psychologists have 
identified as two different lenses, the 
insider lens and the outsider lens, that 
individuals utilize during negotiations. 
A negotiator usually uses an insider 
lens to make decisions when they are 
deeply engaged in a specific situation 
and relying on intuitive thinking. On 
the other hand, a negotiator tends to 
adopt an outsider lens when they are 
removed from a situation and using 
rational thinking. Unfortunately, adopt￾ing the outsider lens is frequently not 
the default option during negotiations. 
However, utilizing the outsider lens 
rather than relying on intuition is vital 
in preventing negotiators from being 
influenced by biases that can ulti￾mately lead negotiators to make irratio￾nal decisions. 122
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 497 21/12/22 7:05 AM498 PART 3 The Group
Individual Differences in Negotiation 
Effectiveness
Are some people better negotiators than others? The answer is complex. Although 
recent research suggests that the situation or relationship tends to account more 
for negotiation outcomes, individual differences explain to a great degree how 
people perceive these outcomes.123 On the one hand, some characteristics like 
status impact negotiating effectiveness. Take CEOs, for example. They are ulti￾mately able to bargain with corporate boards to get larger shares of residuals, ulti￾mately resulting in shareholders getting less of the cut. Moreover, they have more 
bargaining power in their negotiations with boards, prompting some researchers 
to ask whether “CEOs ever lose.”124 On the other hand, there are certain per￾sonality traits and psychological individual differences that can have an effect on 
negotiation effectiveness. For instance, if you tend to be low on emotional stabil￾ity, you will probably view an unsuccessful negotiation as much more catastrophic 
than it actually was. Research suggests that extroverted, open, and honest negotia￾tors tend to have better experiences than others.125
Four factors influence how effectively individuals negotiate: personality, 
mood/emotions, culture, and gender.
Personality Traits in Negotiations
Can you predict a negotiation partner’s negotiating tactics if you know something 
about their personality? Because personality and negotiation outcomes are only 
weakly related, the answer is, at best, sort of.126 Studies of marketing managers, 
lawyers, and construction supervisors suggest that when it comes to negotiation 
effectiveness, people who are ambitious and likeable tend to fare the best.127
But most research has focused on the Big Five trait of agreeableness, for 
obvious reasons—agreeable individuals are cooperative, compliant, kind, and 
conflict-averse. We might think such characteristics make agreeable individuals 
easy prey in negotiations, especially distributive ones. Although this prediction 
may come true if the agreeable negotiator is bargaining with a partner who is 
low on honesty or humility, overall, agreeableness is only weakly related to nego￾tiation outcomes.128 Furthermore, if the agreeable person seeks to preserve 
relationships at all costs and avoid straining them, then the person may be more 
likely to fare worse in a distributive negotiation.129
Interestingly, what seems to be more important is whether the negotiators 
have similar personalities (even if these traits are perceived by most people as 
negative!): When they do, they tend to reach an agreement faster, perceive less 
conflict, display more positive emotions, and have better impressions of the 
other negotiation partner.130 Furthermore, when both parties seek to preserve 
relationships at all costs (as an element of agreeableness), they tend to fare 
much better in integrative negotiation.131
Self-efficacy (see the chapter on motivation theory) is one individual￾difference variable that seems to relate consistently to negotiation outcomes.132
This is an intuitive finding—it is not too surprising to hear that those who 
believe they will be more successful in negotiation situations tend to perform 
more effectively. It may be that individuals who are confident stake out stronger 
claims, are less likely to back down from their positions, and exhibit confidence 
that intimidates others. Conversely, those who are less confident and experience 
more threats to their self-worth during negotiation are less likely to be assertive 
and, therefore, experience suboptimal negotiation outcomes.133 Although the 
exact mechanism is not yet clear, it does seem that negotiators may benefit from 
trying to get a boost in confidence before going to the bargaining table. One 
14-5 Show how individual 
differences influence 
negotiations.
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 498 21/12/22 7:05 AMConflict and Negotiation CHAPTER 14 499
way self-efficacy may operate is through autonomy and control. For instance, 
executives who believed that their and their organization’s fate was changeable 
were more likely to engage in entrepreneurial, negotiating behaviors (which 
improved their financial performance in the long run).134
However, try not to be too confident: If you are negotiating with someone 
who has power over you (e.g., a supervisor who will be judging your perfor￾mance in the future), it would be prudent to try to prevent negative relationship 
outcomes because you have more to lose.135 Moreover, a sense of entitlement 
might lead you to demand excessive and unearned terms in a negotiation, 
which can lead to unethical negotiation behavior, a damaged reputation, and 
pernicious negotiation outcomes.136
Finally, some research suggests that emotional intelligence (EI) and emo￾tion recognition ability is linked to gains in negotiation performance as well 
as to perceptions of being more cooperative and likeable.137 Having an honest 
reputation also engenders trust and reduces the extent to which negotiation 
partners try to deceive you (but if you deceive them and break your reputa￾tion, watch out!).138 In the next section, we describe how specific emotions and 
moods affect negotiations.
Moods and Emotions in Negotiations
Do moods and emotions influence negotiation? They do, but the way they work 
depends on the emotion as well as the context.139 A negotiator who shows anger can 
induce concessions, for instance, because the other negotiator believes no further 
concessions from the angry party are possible. The context matters because negotia￾tors are trying to find a way into the inner world of their negotiation partners. If they 
believe the emotion is incidentally being expressed as a part of the situation (and not 
a genuine expression), they may disregard it, or it may not be as effective.140
A number of factors influence whether anger is effective in negotiations. One 
factor that governs this outcome is power—you should show anger in negotiations 
only if you have at least as much power as your counterpart. If you have less, show￾ing anger actually seems to provoke hardball reactions from the other side.141
Another factor is how genuine your anger is—“faked” anger, or anger produced 
from surface acting, is not effective, but showing anger that is genuine (deep act￾ing) is (see the chapter on emotion and mood).
142 However, maybe you should 
not hold it in either: Suppressing anger hurts performance because it is distract￾ing to the negotiator, but only when the anger is integral to the negotiation.143
Moreover, having a history of showing anger actually induces more concessions 
because the other party perceives the negotiator as “tough.”144 However, when 
negotiating with the same partner, negative emotions spill over from negotiation 
to negotiation, resulting in worse outcomes in subsequent negotiations.145 If you 
use anger to “win” a negotiation, even though the tactic might be effective, you 
might lose in the long run as the other party is less likely to follow through with the 
deal and less likely to work with you again.146 Finally, the effects of anger in nego￾tiations vary across cultures. For instance, one study found that when East Asian 
participants showed anger, it induced more concessions than when the negotia￾tor expressing anger was from the United States or Europe, perhaps because of 
the perception of East Asians as less quick to show anger.147 Regardless of strictly 
positive or negative effects, your anger could lead the negotiating partner to try to 
seek more information about your preferences and priorities, leading to higher 
joint gains for both parties.148
Several other emotions also have effects on negotiation performance. For 
instance, anxiety appears to have an impact on negotiation. People who experi￾ence more anxiety about a negotiation may use deception more frequently in 
dealing with others.149 Moreover, anxious negotiators expect lower outcomes, 
respond to offers more quickly, and exit the bargaining process sooner, leading 
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 499 21/12/22 7:05 AM500 PART 3 The Group
them to obtain worse outcomes.150 Relatedly, the expression of sadness can elicit 
more concessions, but only when the other negotiator perceives the expresser as 
lower in power and anticipates future interactions with this person and when the 
relationship is collaborative.151 This illustrates why it is important in both types of 
negotiation for parties to display sympathy for their counterparts, when needed, 
as this appeals to perceptions of rationality and fairness.152 Paradoxically, how￾ever, the excessive expression of sympathy and empathy (although leading to bet￾ter relational outcomes) may actually hurt value capture in negotiation because it 
moves the focus from the negotiation partners to one person’s situation.153
Even emotional unpredictability affects negotiation outcomes; negotiators 
who express positive and negative emotions in an unpredictable way extract 
more concessions because this behavior makes the other party feel less in con￾trol.154 As one negotiator put it, “Out of the blue, you may have to react to 
something you have been working on in one way, and then something entirely 
new is introduced, and you have to veer off and refocus.”155 However, emotional 
ambivalence tends to be related to more integrative agreements and concession 
making, as the ambivalent person is perceived as submissive.156
Culture and Race in Negotiations
Do people negotiate differently as a function of their culture? Yes, they appear 
to. In general, it appears people generally negotiate more effectively within cul￾tures than between them.
It appears that for successful cross-cultural negotiations, it is especially 
important that the negotiators be high on the personality trait of openness (see 
the chapter on personality and individual differences). This suggests a good 
strategy is to choose cross-cultural negotiators who are high on openness and to 
avoid factors such as time pressure that tend to inhibit learning about the other 
party. Second, because emotions are culturally sensitive, negotiators especially 
need to be aware of the emotional dynamics in cross-cultural negotiation. For 
example, individuals from East Asian cultures feel that using anger in negotia￾tions is not a desirable or legitimate tactic, so they may refuse to cooperate when 
their negotiation partners become upset.157
Some research on negotiations in the United States and Egypt suggests that 
the same language that leads to integrative agreements in Western cultures 
can backfire in others.158 For example, in the United States, language that 
People generally negotiate more ef￾fectively within cultures than between 
them. Politeness and positivity char￾acterize the typical conflict-avoidant 
negotiations in Japan, such as with

and benefits demands to Ikuo

Industries, which makes Subaru

 emphasizes cognitive, rational, and logical gains and losses tends to promote 
integrative bargaining. However, this language in other cultures, such as Egypt, 
can fail. Language that emphasizes honor, moral integrity, and protecting one’s 
image and strength is preferable. Furthermore, some idiosyncratic rituals that 
differ across cultures can improve the success of integrative bargaining—for 
example, in Western cultures, a handshake promotes integrative deal-making 
because it acts as a signal of cooperative intent. 159
 Although not much research has examined the role of race in negotiations, a recent 
study has found that Black job seekers in the United States are (1) expected to negotiate 
less than White job seekers, (2) penalized in negotiations when they do try to negotiate, 
and (3) penalized more heavily when the negotiator is more racially biased. 160 
 Gender in Negotiations 
 With regard to gender in negotiations, one stereotype is that women are more 
cooperative and pleasant in negotiations than men and, as a result, obtain worse 
outcomes. However, decades of research tend to suggest that the influence of gen￾der in negotiations is highly context dependent, despite very slight differences in 
favor of men. 161 For example, women may be more effective negotiators in collec￾tivist cultures with high harmony and low assertiveness norms. 162 
 The influence of gender on both negotiation behavior and negotiation out￾comes has been examined. Compared to men, women tend to behave in a slightly 
less assertive, less self-interested, more cooperative and concessional manner. 163
However, these differences are reduced when there are restrictions on communica￾tion. The research also suggests that women can actually be more competitive than 
men when the other negotiator engages in a “tit-for-tat” strategy. 164 Furthermore, 
men actually behave more unethically in negotiations than women, behaving 
more opportunistically and morally disengaging from the negotiation. 165 
 However, when it comes to initiating negotiations, women are less likely to 
initiate than men, especially when the situation was ambiguous and when gen￾der role reinforcing information is present in the situational context. 166 For 
instance, as demonstrated in the OB Poll, women are less likely than men to 
engage in salary negotiations following a job offer. 
 Although earlier research concluded that there was a slight benefit for men 
in negotiation outcomes, 167 an updated meta-analysis has found no significant 
difference in men and women. 168 Although men achieved better outcomes, on 
average, these differences were reduced when controlling for negotiation expe￾rience and knowledge of the zone of bargaining, when negotiating on behalf

of others, and when gendered role norms were not activated in the context.169
Moreover, one analysis of data from thousands of women and men negotiators 
found that the gender gap only existed when women had a strong outside alter￾native (e.g., they were more likely to leave the negotiation and get the better 
option elsewhere than stay and “win” the negotiation).170
Aspiring Toward Gender Equity in Negotiations Despite virtually no differences in 
negotiation performance and outcomes, women still feel more hesitant to initiate 
negotiations in organizations. What can be done to change this troublesome state 
of affairs? First, organizational culture plays a role. If an organization, even unwit￾tingly, reinforces gender-stereotypic behaviors (men negotiating competitively, 
women negotiating cooperatively), it will negatively affect negotiations when any￾one goes against stereotype. Men and women need to know that it is acceptable 
for each to show a full range of negotiating behaviors. Thus, a female negotiator 
who behaves competitively and a male negotiator who behaves cooperatively need 
to know that they are not violating expectations. Making sure negotiations are 
designed to focus on well-defined and work-related terms also has promise for 
reducing gender differences by minimizing the ambiguous space for stereotypes 
to operate. This focus on structure and work relevance also obviously helps focus 
negotiations on factors that improve the organization’s performance.
Second, other researchers argue that what can best benefit women is to break 
down gender stereotypes for the individuals who hold them.171 In the long term, 
gender identity awareness and the elimination of gender role stereotypes will help 
women advance in negotiation contexts. However, although ignoring gender dif￾ferences (i.e., “gender blindness”) is often looked down upon in general, some 
research suggests that it can be beneficial in certain work contexts. Negotiation is 
one of them—research shows that gender-blindness in these contexts empowers 
women to take negotiating actions and builds confidence, taking the attention 
away from gender and putting it toward the actual resources to be exchanged.172
Negotiating in a Social Context
We have been mostly discussing negotiations that occur among parties that meet pri￾vately and perhaps only on one occasion. In organizations, however, many negotia￾tions are open-ended and public. When you are trying to figure out who in a work 
group should do a tedious task, negotiating with your supervisor to get a chance to 
travel internationally, or asking for more money for a project; there is a social com￾ponent to the negotiation. You are probably negotiating with someone you already 
know and will work with again, and the negotiation and its outcome are likely to be 
topics people will talk about. To really understand negotiations in practice, then, we 
must consider the social factors of reputation and relationships.
Reputation
Your reputation is the way other people think and talk about you. When it comes 
to negotiation, having a reputation for being trustworthy matters. In short, trust 
in a negotiation process opens the door to many forms of integrative negotiation 
strategies that benefit both parties.173 The most effective way to build trust is to 
behave in an honest way across repeated interactions.174 Then others will feel 
more comfortable making open-ended offers with many different outcomes. This 
helps to achieve win–win outcomes because both parties can work to achieve what 
is most important to themselves while still benefitting the other party.
Sometimes we either trust or distrust people based on what we hear from 
others through the grapevine (see the chapter on power and politics) about 
a person’s characteristics. What type of characteristics help a person develop

 Toward a Better World 
 ALDI: Downstream Environmental and Social 
Implications of Supplier Negotiations 
 ALDI is an international supermar￾ket chain headquartered in Germany. 
For over forty years, it has sought to 
provide high-quality groceries at every￾day low prices. How does ALDI fulfill 
this mission and serve 40  million 
customers each month? It does so 
through volume purchasing, operating 
through exclusive brand products (e.g., 
90  percent of all products offered are 
exclusive to ALDI), overstocked non￾food products that revolve in and out of 
circulation, and avoiding nonessential 
services (e.g., banking, pharmacies) 
that other grocers may provide. 
 Given its business model, ALDI 
strives to forge transparent, fair, and 
sustainable relationships with its 
suppliers, who play a crucial role in 
enabling it to fulfill its mission. In fact, 
worldwide, ALDI has made many great 
strides toward corporate social respon￾sibility (CSR) in its supply chain. For 
instance, it is the fourth most progres￾sive brand worldwide in its progress 
phasing out unsustainable palm oil 
from its chains. ALDI has been lauded 
by many for its efforts to carry more 
water-efficient fruit and vegetables. 
(About 70 percent of global freshwater 
usage stems from fruit and vegetable 
farming.) Moreover, it has set many 
ambitious goals, such as diverting 
90  percent of its operational waste, 
100 percent green packaging for all of 
its products, and reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions by 26 percent by 2025. 
 However, ALDI has recently come 
under fire for some of its fruit sourc￾ing practices. Namely, the results of 
a recent pricing negotiation agree￾ment have caused quite a stir that 
has reverberated through the supply 
chain. Year over year, suppliers and 
watchdogs have become concerned 
with the steadily decreasing ALDI con￾tract prices for bananas. The 2021 
price has fallen by about fifteen cents 
per pound from the price in 2020. 
Banana Link (a banana commodities 
trade union) and a group of Central 
and South American banana producers 
(from Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Panama, and Costa Rica) 
suggest that this is a signal to the 
market of going against its sustainable 
sourcing commitments. 
 These lower negotiated prices worry 
banana suppliers, who think this will 
result in a labor cost squeeze and 
labor conflict as well as market insta￾bility. Even worse, downstream effects 
may present themselves as the aban￾donment of rural communities, con￾tributing to local poverty, undermining 
social cohesion, and hampering devel￾opment in South American countries. 
Beyond its effect on producers, which 
many suggest amounts to an earnings 
reduction by as much as 50 percent for 
smaller banana growers, many worry 
about a price war and other retailers 
following suit. In many ways, ALDI’s 
contract is “the most important for 
South American banana growers.” It 
exercises “special market power given 
its price benchmarking capacity.” The 
downstream effect of this pricing deci￾sion could reverberate through the 
market as other buyers follow suit. 
 On the other hand, ALDI has not 
disputed the pricing reduction and 
notes that it will not affect the price 
paid to farmers. It suggests that the 
lowered prices stem from differences 
in exchange rates and lowered trans￾portation costs due to oil prices plum￾meting during COVID-19. However, the 
union and producers take issues with 
this statement and note that ALDI 
should not lower the price to pro￾ducers without lowering the price to 
 consumers. They see this as an action 
detrimental to banana farmers and 
suppliers, especially during a worldwide 
health crisis and Hurricane Eta, which 
hit several Central American countries 
hard. Moreover, many note that ALDI 
would make negotiation decisions like 
this public at one point—but now, they 
claim its practices are more opaque. 
As Alistair Smith of Banana Link noted, 
“Aldi is listening and not learning . . . 
Aldi needs to align their purchasing 
practices with their ethical aspirations. 
We would encourage their commercial 
decision-makers to become more open 
to discussion.” 
 In a joint statement, Banana Link 
and the American banana producers 
state that “producing in a sustainable 
way entails costs which are assumed 
exclusively by the producer, while the 
rest of the value chain actors avoid 
any responsibility . . . Aldi [does] not 
assume their share of responsibility 
and maintain an opaque negotiating 
position that endangers the subsis￾tence of the producers.” The pricing 
issues in the banana market have 
led The Rainforest Alliance to take a 
stand. Leonie Haakshorst, the lead 
for banana and fruit at the Alliance, 
noted that “prices have gone down 
in the past ten years, while the [sus￾tainability] requirements have gone 
up, as well as costs.” As such, the 
2020 Agriculture Standard has a new 
concept for “shared responsibility,” in 
which shared financial responsibility is 
advocated throughout the supply chain 
for producers, workers, and the pur￾chasing companies. 175
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 503 21/12/22 7:05 AM504 PART 3 The Group
a trustworthy reputation? Individuals who have a reputation for integrity can 
also be more effective in negotiations. They are seen as more likely to keep 
their promises and present information accurately, so others are more will￾ing to accept their promises as part of a bargain. This opens many options 
for the negotiator that would not be available to someone who is not seen 
as trustworthy. Finally, individuals who have more solid reputations are bet￾ter liked and have more friends and allies—in other words, they have more 
social resources, which may give them more implicit power in negotiations. 
 Relationships 
 There is more to repeated negotiations than just reputation. The social, inter￾personal component of relationships with repeated negotiations means that 
individuals go beyond valuing what is simply good for themselves and instead 
start to think about what is best for the other party and the relationship as a 
whole. 176 Repeated negotiations built on a foundation of trust also broaden 
the range of options because a favor or concession today can be offered in 
return for some repayment further down the road. 177 Repeated negotiations 
also facilitate integrative problem solving. This occurs partly because people 
begin to see their negotiation partners in a more personal way over time and 
come to share emotional bonds. 178 Repeated negotiations also make integra￾tive approaches more workable because a sense of trust and reliability has 
been built up. 179 In sum, it is clear that an effective negotiator needs to think 
about more than just the outcomes of a single interaction. Negotiators need 
to think about the relationship they have (and will continue to have) with the 
negotiating partner once an agreement has been reached. 
Would you ever lie in a nego￾tiation? You may immediately 
say no, but imagine you have 
spent months looking for a job with 
little success. However, you recently 
received an offer for the position of 
director of marketing. During your dis￾cussion, the hiring manager asks if 
you have any other offers on the table. 
You do not actually have any other 
offers. Still, you find yourself saying 
that you have several other offers. 
When they ask for more details, you 
tell them that all the offers are signifi￾cantly higher than the one the com￾pany put forth. 
 Although you did not intend to 
deceive your potential employer, nego￾tiations can place us in high-pressure 
situations that present ethical chal￾lenges. Research demonstrates that 
the larger the reward, the more likely 
we are to lie, showing that our ethical 
standards may be more flexible than 
we would like to believe. When negoti￾ating with groups, people are also more 
likely to lie than with just one person. 
The reason is that group interactions 
are perceived as less personal, which 
becomes a perception that individu￾als use to justify unethical behavior. 
Finally, research indicates that whether 
someone will use unethical negotiation 
techniques varies depending on the 
negotiating partner’s nationality. 
 Here are some strategies you can 
employ to navigate some of these ethi￾cal challenges: 
1. Build relationships. Negotiators are 
less likely to utilize unethical tactics 
when they know their counterpart 
well and trust them. They under￾stand that their relationship will be 
in jeopardy if the other side discov￾ers that they have engaged in un￾ethical behavior. 
2. Negotiate in person. Research has 
shown that direct face-to-face con￾tact between negotiating parties 
decreases the use of ethically am￾biguous tactics compared with ne￾gotiations conducted via e-mail or 
phone. 
3. Get to know the whole person. 
 Negotiators tend to rely on stereo￾types when attempting to manage 
cultural differences in international 
negotiation. Instead, take the time 
to learn about the negotiating part￾ner’s culture and get to know them 
individually, including their skills 
and work experience. 180

Third-Parties in Negotiations
To this point, we have discussed bargaining in terms of direct negotiations. 
Occasionally, however, individuals or group representatives reach a stalemate 
and are unable to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. In such 
cases, they may turn to a third party to help them find a solution. There are 
three basic third-party roles: mediator, arbitrator, and conciliator.
A mediator is a neutral third party who facilitates a negotiated solution by 
using reasoning and persuasion, suggesting alternatives, and the like. Mediators 
are widely used in labor–management negotiations and in civil court dis￾putes. Their overall effectiveness is fairly impressive. For example, the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) reported a settlement rate 
through mediation at 72.1 percent.181 But the situation is the key to whether 
mediation will succeed; the conflicting parties must be motivated to bargain 
and resolve their conflict. In addition, conflict intensity cannot be too high; 
mediation is most effective under moderate levels of conflict. Finally, percep￾tions of the mediator are important; to be effective, the mediator must be per￾ceived as neutral and noncoercive.
An arbitrator is a third party with the authority to dictate an agreement. 
Arbitration can be voluntary (requested by the parties) or compulsory (forced 
on the parties by law or contract). The big plus of arbitration over mediation is 
that it always results in a settlement. Whether there is a downside depends on how 
heavy-handed the arbitrator appears. If one party is left feeling overwhelmingly 
defeated, that party is certain to be dissatisfied and the conflict may resurface later. 
Moreover, like mediators, arbitrators are supposed to be impartial and indepen￾dent. Sometimes, conflicts of interest can arise, such as how Kenneth Robinson was 
appointed as arbitrator in multiple cases with several parties (in several different 
suits) concerning the Deepwater Horizon oil rig fire in the Gulf of Mexico.182
A conciliator is a trusted third party who provides an informal communi￾cation link between the negotiator and the negotiation partner. In practice, 
conciliators typically act as more than mere communication conduits. They also 
engage in fact finding, interpret messages, and persuade disputants to develop 
agreements. Agreeable individuals with a concern for others tend to adopt the 
role of conciliator, and they tend to be respected and admired by their peers 
as a result.183 Comparing conciliation to mediation in terms of effectiveness 
has proven difficult because the two overlap a great deal. However, sometimes 
the authority vested in arbitrators and mediators is needed. For example, 
twenty-seven employees who worked at the Estonian HKScani Rakvere meat 
company went on strike in late 2017 protesting low wages. Despite involving a 
conciliator, the dispute continues to be unsolved because neither party is will￾ing to communicate with one another civilly. As the conciliator noted, “I am 
also disappointed with [the] results. If one party says that the salary needs to be 
raised by 50 percent and the other party says 0 percent, and neither side gives 
up, they will never reach an agreement.”184
mediator A neutral third party who 
facilitates a negotiated solution by using 
reasoning, persuasion, and suggestions for 
alternatives.
arbitrator A third party to a negotiation 
who has the authority to dictate an 
agreement.
conciliator A trusted third party who 
provides an informal communication link 
between the negotiator and the negotiation 
partner.
14-7 Assess the roles and 
functions of third-party 
negotiations.
Summary
Conflict is an inevitable part of organizational life. As long as people hold dif￾ferent opinions, value different things, see the future differently, or contest over 
control of valued resources, conflict will arise. However, negotiation is a tool 
people can use to stave off conflict or otherwise address its more nefarious ef￾fects and come to an agreement. In this chapter, we described how conflict can 
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 505 21/12/22 7:05 AM506 PART 3 The Group
be both functional and dysfunctional in organizations. Although we often think 
of it in dysfunctional terms, conflict can be a good thing when the organiza￾tion is stagnating or when there is a desire to produce novel ideas and innova￾tion from the tension. Moreover, there are many different types of conflict. It 
can occur within interpersonal relationships, over the nature of work, and over 
the way work gets done. It can also occur between people or groups or within 
groups. Understanding conflict of a process is also essential because it outlines 
where problems can arise, how parties can approach the conflict productively, 
and where workers and negotiators (such as mediators, arbitrators, and concilia￾tors) can intervene effectively. Concerning negotiation, two general approaches 
revolve around whether the resources being negotiated over are fixed or vari￾able. Just as there is an explicit conflict process, so too is there a negotiation 
process that is important to follow. Careful attention to all parts of the negotia￾tion process (but particularly the preparation and planning phase) is critical to 
negotiation success. Moreover, certain factors are critical in influencing the suc￾cess of negotiations, including negotiators’ personality traits, emotions, culture, 
race, and gender identity. Overall, we must realize that conflict and negotiation 
are social phenomena. They have substantial implications for reputation and 
relationship management.
Implications for Managers
● Do not try to discourage conflict at all costs—sometimes it is beneficial, 
like when trying to brainstorm new ideas or approaches for a new project.
● Communication skills training, efficient organizational structures, skillful 
emotion regulation, and an openness to others’ personalities and values 
are all key in averting unproductive conflict.
● When choosing conflict-handling intentions or conflict management 
strategies, competing and avoiding are rarely effective. Try to take a col￾laborative, compromising, or accommodating approach depending on 
your goals and the situation.
● Conflict management is a strategic enterprise. It involves perceiving con￾flict accurately through multiple lenses (e.g., awareness of cross-cultural 
perspectives), managing others, highlighting shared interests, open dis￾cussion, and, at times, instigating conflict.
● Integrative negotiation strategies often lead to desirable outcomes, but 
can be combined with distributed negotiation strategies to reach even bet￾ter outcomes.
● When both parties have agreed to a negotiation, you will be at an advan￾tage if you can anchor the negotiations by making a precise first offer.
● Although both hardline and softline negotiation strategies have their ben￾efits, softline strategies are often better in the long run if the relationship 
needs to be preserved.
● Softline strategies can show your negotiation partner that you are flexible 
(e.g., giving multiple offers that are of equal value) and giving conces￾sions (e.g., communicating phantom anchors; in other words, you were 
going to ask for more, but you are going to ask for less to preserve the 
relationship).
● Preparation and planning is the most crucial part of the negotiation pro￾cess. Before going into the negotiation, it is often essential to establish 
your (and guess your negotiation partners’) best alternative to a negoti￾ated agreement (BATNA). This is the least you (or your partner) would 
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 506 21/12/22 7:05 AMConflict and Negotiation CHAPTER 14 507
accept from the negotiation. This establishes how much you or your part￾ner is willing to lose.
● Keep in mind that many personality traits and individual differences in￾fluence negotiation effectiveness. These have important implications for 
who to select as negotiators (e.g., personality), what to train for negotia￾tion effectiveness (e.g., communication skills and emotion regulation), 
and what your organization can do from a diversity, equity, and inclusion 
(DEI) standpoint to foster equitable negotiations.
● Always keep in mind that negotiation is a social activity—it is critical to 
be aware of your actions’ effect on your reputation and relationships with 
others.
● When negotiation is unsuccessful and when conflict persists, it may be of 
use to bring in a third party (e.g., a mediator, arbitrator, conciliator).

 Nonunion Positions and the Gig Economy 
Are Bad for Workers 
POINT 
 What do Uber, DoorDash, and Amazon Mechanical Turk all 
have in common? These platforms are fuel for short-term 
freelance work and reflect what economists have dubbed 
the gig economy. Fifty years ago, employers expected workers to stay 
with a company for thirty years. In exchange for their loyalty, employees 
were given more opportunities and a pension. Unlike the labor market 
of today, companies promoted talent from within. As this practice fell 
by the wayside, employers hired employees for shorter and shorter 
periods. Now, many new jobs are not long-term or even short-term 
positions: They are gigs. Employees work as independent contrac￾tors, using third-party platforms to connect to clients. Because these 
employees do not have a traditional employment contract, they have 
complete flexibility: They can work as much or as little as they want. 
 Unfortunately, many of these platforms have a dirty secret. Unlike 
regular employment, people employed primarily through gigs do not 
have the benefits of a traditional job. Because they are considered 
self-employed, they do not get paid for overtime, do not receive ben￾efits, and have no collective bargaining power. There is also evidence 
that they are replacing rather than supplementing more stable em￾ployment. For example, Uber and Lyft drivers tripled in Silicon Valley 
from 2012 to 2014, while payrolled cab and limo jobs decreased by 
31 percent in the same period. 
 Without the ability to collectively bargain, the labor market is akin 
to the Wild West frontier. That is why many freelancers on these plat￾forms are trying to unionize. In New York and Seattle, labor unions 
are trying to allow gig employees to create collective bargaining units. 
Doing so will allow employees to demand health benefits and over￾time. It will also ensure that these employees make a living hourly 
wage, rare for gig employees. Despite working sixty hours a week, 
many employees still do not make as much as traditional employ￾ees. However, many gig workers turn to the Freelancers Union for legal 
advice, access to insurance, and many other resources despite the 
inability to collectively bargain. 
 Yes, it is great for employers to sell younger generations on the 
flexibility of these positions; however in exchange for flexibility, they 
are also losing the power to negotiate for fair working conditions. Let 
us stop pretending that freelance work platforms like Uber are suit￾able for the economy and leave the gig economy trend at the curb. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 W hile the gig economy has its drawbacks, these platforms 
exist for a reason. Employers and employees alike are fed 
up with traditional employment. Yes, some people who work 
through freelance apps use it as a primary source of income. But 
there are just as many, if not more, who just want a flexible second 
job to get a little extra cash. If these positions were like the services 
they are replacing (e.g., cab companies), then gig employees would 
have to agree to specific policies regarding sick days and work a set 
schedule. 
 Many are also skeptical of the idea that freelancers are replacing 
traditional employment. Yes, some city-level data shows that gig-based 
jobs increased while payroll jobs decreased. But more data suggest 
that contractor and payroll jobs have increased in most sectors that 
support freelance platforms. For example, while freelance platforms 
like Uber Eats increased over four years, payroll jobs in hospitality also 
increased. The same is true for the transportation industry over the 
same period. If anything, the reason these freelance platforms have 
been so successful is that these industries are growing. It is not that 
they are replacing traditional services—they are meeting the demand 
that traditional services cannot fulfill. 
 The benefits of having a collective bargaining agreement may also 
be exaggerated. Whenever a group tries to create a collective bar￾gaining agreement, it causes conflict. One poll indicated that most 
employees (80 percent) believed leaders will not protect the group’s 
interests as a whole. Instead, leaders usually use their power in num￾bers to protect their own self-interests in negotiations. 
 Collective bargaining does not just hurt businesses—it also hurts 
the public. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization 
has been trying to put cameras in commercial airline cockpits. These 
cameras would allow authorities and employers to monitor pilots 
on the job. These videos can help piece together why plane crashes 
occur. Yet pilots have been using collective bargaining techniques to 
fight the initiative because it violates airline pilots’ privacy. They also 
insist that it could be used to “lead investigators away from accurate 
conclusions” regarding employees’ performance. 
 Yes, traditional employment allows employees to bargain for rights 
as a group. But this also leads to concessions and conflict that do not 
benefit employees or their employers. 185

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
As you learned in this chapter, conflict can be beneficial 
in certain contexts. However, as we portray it more often, 
it can also be a very destructive force. Thankfully, through 
conflict management and negotiation practices, you have 
learned how and when negotiation and conflict resolu￾tion strategies may be used to address its adverse effects. 
While exploring these topics, you used many skills that can 
help you be more employable. You developed your critical 
thinking, creativity, communication, and social responsi￾bility competencies by evaluating whether good negotia￾tors rely on their intuition, considering the downstream 
effects of corporate negotiation on the environment and 
sustainability, outlining the ethical challenges in negotia￾tion, and debating the benefits of the gig economy for 
workers. In the next section, you will develop these skills 
further while also using your leadership skills to resolve a 
conflict between coworkers, assess how to handle conflict 
resulting from an open-floor-plan office design, and par￾ticipate in a negotiation role play.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE A Negotiation Role Play
You will consider two scenarios for this case: One is more 
distributive, the other more integrative. Form pairs, with 
one of you taking the role of the engineering director 
and the other taking the role of the marketing director. 
Read only your own side’s specific information for the two 
negotiation processes. The overall situation is the same 
for both scenarios, but the priorities and outlook for the 
parties change depending on whether you are negotiat￾ing the “contested resources” scenario or the “combined 
future” scenario.
The Case
Cytrix develops integrated bicycle and running perfor￾mance systems. Runners and bikers wear the Cytrix watch, 
which uses GPS signals to identify their location and the 
distance they have covered. This information can then be 
uploaded to the Cytrix Challenge website, where users 
record their performance over time. Social media tools 
also allow them to compare their performance relative to 
that of friends. The majority of users are either amateur 
student-athletes or committed adult hobbyists like mara￾thon runners.
The organization needs to determine how to allocate 
a fixed pool of resources for future development between 
the marketing and engineering groups. Rather than mak￾ing an executive decision about resource allocation, the 
top management team has asked the respective teams to 
allocate $30 million for planned future development and 
decide who will run different parts of the project.
Specific Information for the Marketing Group
Only the marketing manager should read this section.
The marketing group has been tracking the major sales 
areas and has concluded that Cytrix has saturated the mar￾ket. New sources of customers, especially general consum￾ers interested in health but are not committed athletes, 
will need to be considered for future growth. Research 
into sales of competitive products and areas where com￾petitors are failing to meet consumer demands is needed. 
M14_ROBB0025_19_GE_C14.indd 509 21/12/22 7:05 AM510 PART 3 The Group
The marketing group’s primary goal is to allocate suffi￾cient resources to finance the research. The group also 
wants to retain control over which new products will be 
developed. Marketing would prefer to see engineering act 
in a consulting role, determining how best to manufac￾ture the devices that fit the needs identified above.
Specific Information for the Engineering Group
Only the engineering manager should read this section.
The engineering group has recently been tracking the 
development of new hardware to improve the accuracy 
of distance and speed estimates in remote areas. Several 
other companies are already experimenting with similar 
designs. Engineering believes it will be necessary to de￾velop the technology further to realize this improvement 
fully, so it is both lightweight and inexpensive to produce. 
The engineering group’s primary goal is to allocate suf￾ficient resources to develop these new technologies. The 
engineers would prefer to see marketing act in a consult￾ing role, determining how best to advertise and deliver 
the new devices.
Contested Resources Scenario
The marketing and engineering departments are locked 
in a power struggle. Your side (either marketing or engi￾neering) should try to direct the most significant possible 
proportion of both money and authority toward your pro￾posed program. You still need to think of a solution. The 
other side ultimately agrees to assist you in implementing 
the program. If you cannot reach an agreement for 
shared resources, the CEO will appoint new directors for 
both groups.
Combined Future Scenario
The marketing and engineering departments are eager to 
find a positive solution. Both sides should try to see that 
the company’s future needs are met. You know that to 
achieve success, everyone needs to work together, so you 
would like to find a way to divide the money and resources 
that benefits both marketing and engineering. Plans can 
incorporate multiple techniques for sharing and collabo￾rating with resources.
The Negotiation
At the start of the negotiation, the instructor randomly as￾signs half the groups to the contested resources scenario 
and the other half to the combined future scenario. Begin 
the process by outlining the goals and resources for your 
side of the negotiation. Then negotiate over the terms 
described in your scenario, attempting to advocate for a 
solution that matches your perspective.
Debriefing
Afterward, you will get together with the other students to 
discuss the processes used. Especially consider the differ￾ences in outcomes between the contested resources and 
combined future scenarios. Either scenario could arise in 
a natural work environment, so think about how different 
negotiation situations give rise to different strategies, tac￾tics, and outcomes.
ETHICAL DILEMMA To Intervene or Not to Intervene?
About a year ago, Finley noticed an issue developing be￾tween two of the coworkers on his team. It was likely not 
apparent to everyone as they never yelled at one another 
or were overtly hostile. However, they began to avoid 
each other and would not sit near one another at meet￾ings. Finley noticed that the tension between the two had 
begun to affect their team’s work. Finley decided it was 
necessary to figure out the underlying reason that the two 
were not getting along. Finley decided to talk with one 
of them, as they were close friends. After listening to the 
friend describe the situation, Finley provides friendly sup￾port: Finley is available if they ever need advice or want 
to vent.
Despite Finley’s best efforts, the issue persists. Finley wor￾ries that it may escalate and ultimately impact the team’s 
success. Finley wonders about making their supervisor 
aware of the situation in hopes of finally resolving the 
conflict. However, Finley worries about the consequences 
of involving the supervisor and ultimately decides to try 
to act as a mediator, arranging a conversation with both 
coworkers. At the end of the meeting, the two coworkers 
only agree to continue avoiding one another as much as

CASE INCIDENT Disorderly Conduct
The sound of Matt and Peter’s arguing is familiar to 
everyone in the office by now. To make the best use of 
space and ensure a free flow of discussion and ideas, 
the founder of Markay Design decided to do something 
about the office layout. He decided to convert the one￾floor office of the company to an open plan with no walls 
between workers. The goal of such a layout is to eliminate 
boundaries and enhance creativity. But for Matt and Peter, 
the new arrangement creates a growing sense of tension.
The argument boils down to the question of workspace 
order and organization. Peter prefers to keep his desk 
completely clean and clear, and he keeps a stack of clean￾ing wipes in a drawer to eliminate any dust or dirt. On 
the other hand, Matt likes to keep all his work visible on 
his desk, so sketches, plans, magazines, and photos are 
scattered everywhere, alongside boxes of crackers and 
coffee cups. Peter finds it hard to concentrate when he 
sees Matt’s piles of materials everywhere. At the same 
time, Matt feels he can be more creative and free-flowing 
when he is not forced to clean and organize constantly. 
Many of Matt and Peter’s coworkers wish they would just 
let the issue drop. Peter and Matt enjoyed a good work￾ing relationship in the past, with Peter’s attention to detail 
and thorough planning serving to rein in some of Matt’s 
wild inspirations. But of late, their collaborations have 
been derailed in disputes.
Everyone knows it is not productive to engage in conflicts 
over every minor irritant in the workplace. However, al￾together avoiding conflict can be equally harmful. An 
emerging body of research has examined so-called con￾flict cultures in organizations. The findings suggest hav￾ing a culture that actively avoids and suppresses conflicts 
is associated with lower levels of creativity. Cultures that 
push conflict underground but fail in reducing the under￾lying tensions can become passive-aggressive. These cul￾tures become marked by underhanded behavior against 
other coworkers.
Ultimately, finding a way through the clutter dispute 
will probably be an ongoing process to find a balance 
between perspectives. Both Matt and Peter worry that 
their usually positive work relationship will be too con￾tentious to bear if they cannot find a solution. That 
would be a real mess.
Questions
14-11. Describe some of the factors that led this situa￾tion to become an open conflict.

problem-solving discussion to resolve this con￾flict? What could effectively be changed, and 
what is probably going to remain a problem?187

 SAMSUNG: TRANSFORMING A HIERARCHY 
The Samsung Group is an international leader in electronics—in 2020, 
it commanded over 16 percent of the global smart phone market. The 
conglomerate had an even higher market share before, but now, alongside 
its major rival, Apple, it faces stiff competition collectively from smaller, 
cheaper brands. Yet its current position is still far ahead of the 3 percent 
market share it had in 2009. Samsung remains the largest multinational 
conglomerate corporation in South Korea and among the top 10 largest 
companies in the world. 
 However, this climb to the top has not been without turbulence. In 2016, 
Samsung announced a global recall of the Note 7 after several owners 
discovered their phones on fire. Replacement phones did not solve the 
problem, and production was halted. As if things couldn’t get worse, the heir 
to the Samsung Group, Jay Y. Lee, was jailed for corruption in early 2017. 
There was a public outcry, and the firm’s reputation was at stake. 
 Faced with a leadership vacuum, investors demanded a review of 
the corporate structure. Strategic, operational, financial, legal, tax, and 
accounting considerations had to be scrutinized to determine the optimal 
structure for the conglomerate. Clearly there were issues of quality (as in the 
Note 7 debacle) and transparency (as in the Lee bribery and embezzlement 
scandal). In spite of all this, Samsung’s share price didn’t just hold; it rose. 
While the decision was taken not to change the fundamental corporate 
structure, other structures underwent change internally. 
M15_ROBB0025_19_GE_C15.indd 513 13/12/22 3:10 AM514 PART 3 The Group
Much attention was given to the Future Strategy Office, the centralized 
headquarters of Samsung. The Office was referred to as the Control Tower 
and played an important role in lobbying government on policy issues. The 
centralized headquarters also enabled Lee to maneuver as he did, and as a 
response to his conviction, and to increase scrutiny of decision making, the 
Future Strategy Office was dismantled.
This decision promised to provide more autonomy to the subsidiaries. 
On the face of it, these structural changes appeared to address concerns 
over abuse of power. However, considering the 59 subsidiaries and 
500,000 employees in the Group, questions were raised about how 
organized the Group would be without its central authority in place, and 
the fact is that all group-wide projects and tasks were halted as a result of 
the decision to disband the Office. Concerns were raised that the lack of a 
central coordinating body could pose challenges to collaboration across 
the entities.
What structural adjustments lie ahead for Samsung? With the cutthroat 
level of hyper-competition in the electronics sector, the ability to innovate 
is vital. Can Samsung attract the innovative talent needed for its still very 
hierarchical structures?1
Even for a startup with only a few employees, choosing an organizational 
structure requires far more than simply deciding who is the supervisor 
and how many employees are needed to complete the work. The 
organization’s structure determines what relationships form, the formality 
of those relationships, and many work outcomes. The structure may also 
change as organizations grow and shrink, as management trends dictate, 
and as the organization pivots to realize new visions and goals. Structural 
decisions are arguably the most fundamental ones that founders and 
executives must make toward sustaining organizational growth. In this 
chapter, we will explore how structure affects employee behavior and the 
organization as a whole.
What Is Organizational Structure?
Google is a company that “does organizational structure right.”2
 Its structure sup￾ports the innovative culture, competitiveness, and growth of the company. Although 
it might not seem like it at first, structure is very important for different aspects of 
business:3
 For example, Dr. Timothy Giardino, the human resources (HR) direc￾tor at Cantata Health and Meta Healthcare IT Solutions, suggests, “Structure 
follows strategy. . . structure controls behavior. . .[and] structure supports execu￾tion.”4
 Structure can also stand in the way of organizations fulfilling their social mis￾sion. For example, systematic biases and structural barriers can prevent members 
from underrepresented groups from advancing in their careers.5
 Organizations 
have a responsibility to consider the need for organizational change and identify 
barriers that formally (and informally) limit their advancement.

of an organization’s 
structure.

An organizational structure defines how job tasks are formally divided, grouped, 
and coordinated.6
 Seven key elements should be considered when designing an 
organization’s structure: work specialization, departmentalization, chain of com￾mand, span of control, centralization and decentralization, formalization, and 
boundary spanning.7
 Exhibit 15-1 presents each element as the answer to an 
important structural question, and the following sections describe each one.
Work Specialization
A great deal of work goes into that pint of ice cream you enjoy when you cel￾ebrate doing well on a test or quiz. Let us take a trip to the Ben & Jerry’s factory 
in Waterbury, Vermont, to see how it is made.8
First, shortly after arriving at the factory, milk and cream are pumped from 
the truck into six thousand–gallon storage silos and kept at thirty-six degrees by 
“shipping and receiving coordinators.” Next, the “mix master” worker mixes 
the milk, cream, liquid cane sugar, egg yolks, and natural stabilizers using a one 
thousand–gallon mega-blender. A “pasteurization and homogenization special￾ist” than heats the mix to kill harmful bacteria (e.g., pasteurization). The blend 
is forced through a very small opening at very high pressure (e.g., homogeniza￾tion) to ensure that fat particles are finely emulsified and then cooled in a five 
thousand–gallon tank for four to eight hours.
After the wait, the “flavor vat” technicians mix in the flavorings, purees, and 
extracts in five hundred–gallon steel vats, after which the mixture is pumped 
into a freezing cylinder known as the barrel, where it chills to the consistency of 
soft-serve ice cream. Now here is where the magic happens—depending on the 
flavor of ice cream, the ice cream passes through the “chunk feeder” (if it is get￾ting chocolate chunks or other ingredients), the “variegator” (if it is a “swirled” 
flavor), and then the automatic filler, where it is dispensed into the pint contain￾ers and frozen even further (to the point of hard ice cream).
At this point, “freezer workers” oversee the process of the ice cream pints’ 
bundling and assembly into shrink wrap for shipment and into pallets that are 
stored in a twenty degree below zero warehouse. Of course, “quality assurance

specialists” are involved in each step, making sure the ice cream is of top quality 
before arriving in your hands. By dividing the monumental task of manufactur￾ing ice cream at a small plant in Vermont that is to be distributed far and wide, 
Ben & Jerry’s is able to produce a million pints a day with the help of hundreds 
of workers performing specialized tasks.9
Work specialization, or division of labor, describes the degree to which 
activities in the organization are divided into separate jobs and steps, each 
completed by a separate individual.10 Individuals specialize in doing part of an 
activity rather than completing the entire process themselves. Overall, special￾ization is a means of making the most efficient use of employees’ skills and even 
successfully improving them through repetition. Less time is spent changing 
tasks, putting away tools and equipment from a prior step, and getting ready 
for another. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk program, TopCoder, and others like it 
have facilitated a new trend in microspecialization in which extremely small pieces 
of programming, data processing, or evaluation tasks are delegated to a global 
network of individuals by a program manager who then assembles the results.11
Work can be performed more efficiently if it is specialized, and the practice 
still has applications in many industries. For example, could you build a car by 
yourself? Not likely! Equally important, it is easier and less costly to find and 
train workers to do specific tasks, especially in highly sophisticated and com￾plex operations. Work specialization increases efficiency and productivity by 
encouraging the creation of customized inventions and machinery. However, 
despite its advantages, specialization could be carried too far. Human disecono￾mies may begin to surface in the form of boredom, fatigue, stress, low produc￾tivity, inferior quality, increased absenteeism, and high turnover, which more 
than offset the economic advantages (see Exhibit 15-2).12 Productivity could 
be increased by enlarging, rather than narrowing, the scope of job activities. 
Giving employees a variety of activities to do, allowing them to do a whole and 
complete job, and putting them into teams with interchangeable skills often 
achieved significantly higher output, with increased employee satisfaction.13
Moreover, the success of specialization depends heavily on the stability of the 
work tasks and duties to be completed: If they are constantly changing, special￾ization may be less desirable.14
Most managers today recognize the economies that specialization provides in 
certain jobs and the problems when it is carried too far. High work specialization 
helps fast-food restaurants make and sell hamburgers and fries efficiently and 
aids medical specialists in most health maintenance organizations. Wherever 
job roles can be broken down into specific tasks or projects, specialization is

possible. Specialization may still confer advantages outside manufacturing, par￾ticularly where job sharing and part-time work are prevalent. This opens the 
way for employers to use online platforms to assign multiple workers to tasks in 
a broader functional role like marketing.15 Thus, whereas specialization tradi￾tionally focuses on breaking manufacturing tasks into specific duties within the 
same plant, specialization can also judiciously break complex tasks into specific 
elements that can be performed anywhere by specialists.
Departmentalization
Once jobs have been divided through work specialization, they must be grouped 
so common tasks can be coordinated and complexity can be reduced. The basis 
by which jobs are grouped is called departmentalization.
16
Functional Departmentalization One of the most popular ways to group activi￾ties is by the functions performed. A manufacturing manager might organize 
a plant into engineering, accounting, manufacturing, HR, and supply chain 
departments. A hospital might have departments for research, surgery, inten￾sive care, accounting, and so forth. Functional departmentalization allows 
efficiencies to be gained from putting specialists that focus on similar areas 
together. Furthermore, functional departmentalization allows specialists to 
become experts more easily than if they worked in diversified units. However, 
coordination among these diverse units is a problem, and infighting in units 
and between units can lead to reduced motivation.
Product or Service Departmentalization We can also departmentalize jobs by 
the type of product or service the organization produces.17 Procter & Gamble 
(P&G) places each major product sector (e.g., baby care, feminine care, beauty, 
family care, health care, grooming, fabric care, home care, and P&G Ventures) 
under an executive who has complete global responsibility for it. Products such 
as Tide, Pampers, Charmin, Tampax, Gillette, My Black is Beautiful, Crest, 
Prilosec, and Febreeze would each be the responsibility of a different sector.18
The major advantage is increased accountability for performance because all 
activities related to a specific product or service are under the direction of a 
single manager.19 But for this type of departmentalization to be effective, it is 
also important for the department or team to have a broader understanding of 
the organization outside their own product specialization (e.g., knowing what 
the other teams and departments work on over time).20
Geographical Departmentalization When a firm is departmentalized based 
on geography, each function (for example, sales) may be allocated to different 
regions or markets (e.g., a country may have northern, western, southern, and 
eastern regions).21 This form is valuable when an organization’s customers are 
scattered over a large geographic area and have similar needs within their loca￾tions. For this reason, Toyota changed its management structure into geographic 
regions “so that they may develop and deliver ever better products,” said Toyota 
President Akio Toyoda.22 When organizations departmentalize by region, these 
departments and co-located teams form their own identities and practices.23
These regional teams affect the coordination and performance across locations 
as well as how information is acquired and shared throughout the organiza￾tion.24 Organizations with geographical departmentalization should pay special 
care toward inter-region communication and knowledge sharing, which can 
be made easier through virtual communications and knowledge management 
systems.

jobs in an organization are grouped together.
M15_ROBB0025_19_GE_C15.indd 517 13/12/22 3:10 AM518 PART 3 The Group
Process Departmentalization Process departmentalization involves structuring 
employee, product, or customer processes.25 For example, information secu￾rity firms may have (1) a policy management department that works with HR, 
legal, and project management functions to set information security policies; 
(2) a network security department that oversees network security, intrusion 
prevention, and event management; (3) an identity and access management 
department to oversee user credentialing, identification, and access; and (4) 
an operations department that oversees implementing changes and ensuring 
systems are up and running.26 As a user of IT services, you often start by agree￾ing to an acceptable use policy, requesting access to the system as well as an 
online identify, and then interacting with the network while being notified of 
security breaches and relevant system maintenance/outages. A final category 
of departmentalization is based on the customer the organization seeks to reach. 
For example, an assessment organization may departmentalize according to 
government, industrial, or private consumers. Process departmentalization can 
help organizations better offer products and services, even if the process needs 
to be changed occasionally.27
Departmentalization Implications for OB Organizations do not always stay with 
the departmentalization structure they initially adopt. Microsoft, for instance, 
used customer departmentalization for years, organizing around its customer 
bases: consumers, large corporations, software developers, and small businesses. 
In June 2013, Microsoft announced a restructuring to functional departmen￾talization, citing a need to foster continuing innovation. The new departments 
grouped jobs by traditional functions, including engineering, marketing, busi￾ness development, strategy and research, finance, HR, and legal.28 Microsoft 
continued to struggle with the reorganization, announcing additional changes 
in its leadership personnel and team structure less than a year later. These 
changes included, for example, product specialization and functional spe￾cialization; for instance, the PowerPoint, Excel, and Access teams have been 
reorganized into content creation and data visualization teams.29 Since then,

A global firm that operates on a local 
scale in more than 200 countries, 
The Coca-Cola Company is organized 
into five geographic segments: North 
America, Latin America, Europe, the 
Middle East and Africa, and Asia 
Pacific. The structure enables it to 
tailor its strategy to markets in differ￾ent stages of economic development 
and with differing consumer tastes 
and buying behavior.
M15_ROBB0025_19_GE_C15.indd 518 13/12/22 3:10 AMFoundations of Organization Structure CHAPTER 15 519
Microsoft has restructured yet again to primarily departmentalize by product 
type, with smaller groups organized by function and geographic segment (U.S. 
and international).30 The changes in Microsoft’s organizational structure were 
expected to “reshape how we interact with our customers, developers, and key 
innovation partners, delivering a more coherent message and family of product 
offerings.”31
These more divisional structures (e.g., product, geographical, process, and 
customer departmentalization) have the opposite benefits and disadvantages of 
the simple structure.32 They facilitate coordination in units to achieve on-time 
completion, budget targets, and development and introduction of new prod￾ucts to market while addressing the specific concerns of each unit. They provide 
clear responsibility for all activities related to a product, but with duplication of 
functions and costs. Sometimes this is helpful—say, when the organization has 
a unit in Spain and another in China, and a marketing strategy is needed for a 
new product. Marketing experts in both places can incorporate the appropri￾ate cultural perspectives into their region’s marketing campaigns. However, hav￾ing marketing function employees in two different countries may represent an 
increased cost for the organization, in that it is doing basically the same task in 
two different places.
As we see throughout this text, whenever changes are deliberately made in 
organizations to align practices with organizational goals, particularly the goals 
of strong leaders, a good execution of the changes creates a much higher prob￾ability for improvement.
Chain of Command
While the chain of command was once a basic cornerstone in the design of orga￾nizations, it has far less importance today. But managers should still consider its 
implications, particularly in industries that deal with potential life-or-death situ￾ations when people need to rely quickly and suddenly on decision makers. The 
chain of command is an unbroken line of authority that extends from the top of 
the organization to the lowest echelon and clarifies who reports to whom.33 But 
first, we cannot discuss the chain of command without also discussing authority
and unity of command.
Authority Authority, essentially formal power as discussed in the earlier chap￾ter on power and politics, refers to the rights inherent in a managerial posi￾tion to give orders and expect them to be obeyed. To facilitate coordination, 
each managerial position is given a place in the chain of command, and each 
person is given a degree of authority to meet their responsibilities. In chains 
of command where most of the authority is vested in one person, LMX (see 
the chapter on leadership) becomes more important, as the leader’s “buy-in” 
becomes more important to getting things done.34
Unity of Command Unity of command states that a person should have one and 
only one superior to whom they are directly responsible. If the unity of com￾mand is broken, an employee might have to cope with conflicting demands 
or priorities from several supervisors.35 Although unity of command is more 
common than having multiple supervisors, if you do find yourself in the situ￾ation where you report to multiple people, be aware of your own workload, 
conflicting messages, who has the “final say” in disputes, and loyalty expecta￾tions.36 Furthermore, you should try to be proactive about your workload, foster 
communication between your supervisors, and set up boundaries and norms for 
effective communication and workflow.

M15_ROBB0025_19_GE_C15.indd 519 13/12/22 3:10 AM520 PART 3 The Group
Chain of Command Implications for OB Times change, and so do the basic tenets 
of organizational design. The chain of command in many ways is considered 
an “old-fashioned” approach to structure,37 and as we will learn as we prog￾ress through the chapter, collaborative, flexible, and self-organizing approaches 
tend to be more popular. A low-level employee today can access information 
in seconds that was available only to top managers a generation ago, and many 
employees are empowered to make decisions previously reserved for manage￾ment.38 Considering the popularity of self-managed and cross-functional teams 
(see the chapter on work teams), you can see why authority and unity of com￾mand may appear to hold less relevance.
Yet many organizational leaders still believe that they are the most produc￾tive when they enforce a chain of command. Indeed, one survey of more than 
a thousand managers found that 59 percent agreed with the statement “There 
is an imaginary line in my company’s organizational chart. Strategy is created 
by people above this line, while strategy is executed by people below the line.” 
However, this same survey found that lower-level employees’ buy-in (agreement 
and active support) to the organization’s overall, big-picture strategy was inhib￾ited by their reliance on the hierarchy for decision making.39 Perhaps the big￾gest drawback to the “chain of command” is its detrimental effects on creativity 
and innovation. Authority and unity of command both can negatively affect the 
idea generation process and put a strain on innovation implementation.40
Span of Control
How many employees can a manager direct efficiently and effectively? The span 
of control describes the number of levels (or layers) and managers in an organi￾zation.41 All things being equal, the wider or larger the span, the fewer the levels, 
and the more employees at each level, the more efficient the organization.42
Narrow or small spans have their advocates. By keeping the span of control 
to five or six employees, a manager can maintain close control.43 But narrow 
spans have three major drawbacks.44 First, they are expensive because they 
add levels of management. Assume two organizations each have about 4,100 
operative-level employees. One has a uniform span of four and the other a span 
of eight. As Exhibit 15-3 illustrates, the wider span of eight will have two fewer 
levels and approximately eight hundred fewer managers. If the average manager

subordinates that a manager can direct

in the organization makes $60,000 a year, the wider span will save $48 million 
a year in management salaries! Second, narrow spans make vertical communi￾cation in the organization more complex. The added levels of hierarchy slow 
down decision making and can isolate upper management. Third, narrow 
spans encourage overly tight supervision and discourage employee autonomy. 
Supervisors no longer have time to provide subordinates with the necessary 
leadership and support; thus, employee performance suffers.45
The trend in recent years has been toward wider spans of control.46 However, 
to ensure that performance does not suffer because of these wider spans, orga￾nizations might invest heavily in employee training because managers recognize 
they can handle a wider span best when employees know their jobs well or can 
turn to coworkers with questions.
Centralization and Decentralization
Centralization refers to the degree to which decision making is concentrated 
at a single point in the organization.47 In centralized organizations, top man￾agers make all the decisions, and lower-level managers merely carry out their 
directives. In organizations at the other extreme, decentralized decision making 
is pushed down to the managers closest to the action or to workgroups.48 The 
concept of centralization includes only formal authority—that is, the rights 
inherent to a position. Management centralization efforts are often directed 
toward decision making by lower-level managers, who are closer to the action 
and typically have more detailed knowledge about problems than top manag￾ers. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, decentralization became the default 
mode for many organizations, as decision making was delegated to localized 
teams empowered to make decisions about following local health and safety 
regulations and guidelines.49 However, centralization is not limited to members 
within the organization—sometimes, decision-making authority can be allo￾cated to external managers or highly skilled employees in other firms that are 
contracting with the organization. In these instances, there is a greater likeli￾hood for organizational change and innovation.50
A decentralized organization can act more quickly to solve problems, 
more people provide input into decisions,51 leaders take on the role of cham￾pioning employees to accomplish goals,52 and employees are less likely to 
feel alienated from those who make decisions that affect their work lives.53
Centralized organizations are better for avoiding commission errors (bad 
choices), while decentralized organizations are better for avoiding omission 
errors (lost opportunities).54 Concerning creativity, research on a large num￾ber of Finnish organizations demonstrated that companies with decentralized 
research and development (R&D) offices in multiple locations were better at 
producing innovations than companies that centralized all R&D in a single 
office.55 Decentralization is often necessary for companies with offshore sites 
because localized decision making is needed to respond to each region’s oppor￾tunities, client base, and specific laws, while centralized oversight is needed 
to hold regional managers accountable. Failure to successfully balance these 
priorities can harm not only the organization but also its relationships with for￾eign governments.56 Sometimes, however, both centralization and decentraliza￾tion can be double-edged swords—one study of nearly three thousand U.S. Air 
Force officers suggests that there can be negative effects of decentralization in 
organizations with multiteam systems, including excessive risk seeking and coor￾dination failures.57 Moreover, when voice is centralized in organizations (e.g., 
only a few people or leaders speaking up), employees’ knowledge is not fully 
utilized, and the organization can perform more poorly as a result.58

Formalization
Formalization refers to the degree to which jobs within the organization are 
standardized.59 If a job is highly formalized, the employee has a minimal 
amount of discretion over what to do (e.g., there are explicit job descrip￾tions) and when and how to do it, resulting in consistent and uniform out￾put. There are lots of organizational rules and clearly defined procedures 
covering work processes. Clerical workers at a publishing firm, for example, 
generally have very formalized jobs in which there are standard procedures 
and expectations for what they do. Conversely, where formalization is low, 
job behaviors are relatively unprogrammed and employees have a great 
deal of freedom to exercise discretion in their work. For example, publish￾ing representatives who call on college professors to inform them of their 
company’s new publications have a great deal of freedom in their jobs. They 
have a general standardized sales pitch, which they tailor as needed, and 
rules and procedures governing their behavior may be little more than sug￾gestions on what to emphasize about forthcoming titles and the require￾ment to submit a weekly sales report.
Sometimes, formalization can be detrimental to organizational effec￾tiveness. Research on ninety-four high-technology Chinese firms indicated 
that formalization can hurt team flexibility in decentralized organiza￾tion structures, suggesting that formalization does not work as well where 
duties are inherently interactive or where there is a need to be flexible and 
innovative.60 On the other hand, sometimes it is beneficial: For instance, 
formalizing pay determinations for jobs reduces gender inequality in most 
circumstances.61 Furthermore, issues of fairness and ethics matter. If the 
formalization is fair and legitimate (e.g., board members are given tasks, 
duties, appointments, and titles commensurate with their worth), turn￾over can be prevented as employees worry less about making sense of their 
positions and are not as overburdened with coordination and clarification 
demands.62 Finally, in times of complexity and turbulence, formalization 
can be a good thing when organizational members are driven to collaborate 
with one another to pull through the crisis.63
Boundary Spanning
To this point, we have described how organizations can create well-defined 
task structures and chains of authority. These systems facilitate control and 
coordination for specific tasks, but if there is too much division within an 
organization, attempts to coordinate across groups can be disastrous. One 
way to overcome this sense of compartmentalization and retain the ben￾efits of structure is to encourage or create boundary-spanning roles.
Boundary spanning occurs when individuals form relationships with 
people outside their formally assigned groups.64 For instance, an HR exec￾utive who frequently engages with the IT group is engaged in boundary 
spanning, as is a member of an R&D team who implements ideas from 
a production team. These activities help prevent formal structures from 
becoming too rigid and, not surprisingly, enhance organization and 
team creativity, decision making, knowledge sharing, and performance.65
Boundary spanning can be an excellent tool for expatriates and local 
workers to collaborate: For example, one global study of aid workers from 
nearly sixty humanitarian aid organizations found that office leaders play 
a boundary-spanning role that serves to connect groups and facilitate joint 
learning and creativity.66
Boundary-spanning activities occur not only within but also between organi￾zations.67 Executives and employees transfer knowledge across organizational

within an organization are standardized.

relationships outside their formally assigned

boundaries, translate information or communicate insights that may not have 
been realized yet, make connections with other organizations, or even trans￾form the organization through influence.68 Positive results are especially strong 
in organizations that encourage extensive internal communication; in other 
words, external boundary spanning is most effective when it is followed up with 
internal boundary spanning.69 Although you might think that leaders should be 
the ultimate boundary spanners, sometimes the relationships between employ￾ees across companies (e.g., salesperson–client) are even stronger than those 
between organizational leaders.70 Regardless, interorganizational boundary 
spanning can be a bad thing. For instance, if an employee leaves to go to a 
competitor, although that employee may serve as a “connection” between the 
two networks, that employee is also more likely to leak sensitive information.71
Moreover, it is easy for executives to underestimate their own knowledge of 
their networks.72
Organizations can use formal mechanisms to facilitate boundary-spanning 
activities. One method is to assign formal liaison roles or develop committees 
of individuals from different areas of the organization.73 Development activities 
can also facilitate boundary spanning—for instance, learning the jargon, meth￾ods, and practices of other groups can be helpful in bridging the gap between 
groups.74 Employees with experience in multiple functions, such as accounting 
and marketing, are more likely to engage in boundary spanning.75 Many organi￾zations may try to set the stage for these sorts of positive relationships by creat￾ing job rotation programs so new hires get a better sense of different areas of 
the organization. Another method to encourage boundary spanning is to bring 
attention to overall organizational goals, such as efficiency and innovation, and 
shared identity concepts so that employees are more comfortable reaching out 
to others.76
You probably have personal experience with at least some of the results of 
decisions that leaders have made in your school or workplace that were related 
to the elements of organizational structure. The organizational framework, 
which can be depicted by drawing an organizational chart, can help you clarify 
these leaders’ decisions. We will discuss them next.

Common Organizational Frameworks 
and Structures
Organizational designs are known by many names and are constantly evolving 
in response to changes in the way work is done. We will start with three of the 
more common organizational frameworks: the simple structure, the bureaucracy, 
and the matrix structure.
The Simple Structure
A simple structure is common in many startups, such as those found in 
Silicon Valley. The modern tech startup is driven by an entrepreneurial 
founder, supported by a core set of loyal employees who work long hours, 
who enacts a unifying vision.77 The simple structure has a low degree of 
departmentalization, wide spans of control (e.g., a flat organization), 
authority centralized in a single person, and little formalization.78 It usu￾ally has only two or three vertical levels, a loose body of employees, and 
one individual with decision-making authority. Most companies start as a 
simple structure, and many innovative technology-based firms with short 
life spans, like cell phone app development firms, remain compact by 
design.79
Exhibit 15-4 is an organization chart for a retail men’s store owned and man￾aged by Saqlain Hussain. Saqlain employs two full-time salespeople, two cashiers, 
and an extra worker for weekends and holidays, but Saqlain “runs the show.” 
Although this type of organization is typical for a small business, in times of cri￾sis large companies often simplify their structures (though not to this degree) as 
a means of focusing their resources.
Simple structures are strong because they are, well, simple. They are 
fast, flexible, and inexpensive to operate, and accountability is clear. One 
major weakness is that such a structure becomes increasingly inadequate 
as an organization grows because its low formalization and high central￾ization tend to create information overload at the top. Decision making 
typically becomes slower as the single executive tries to continue doing it 
all. This proves the undoing of many small businesses. If the structure is 
not changed and made more elaborate, the firm often loses momentum 
and can eventually fail.80 The simple structure’s other weakness is that it is 
risky—everything depends on one person. If the owner–manager becomes 
ill, it can literally halt the organization’s information and decision-making 
capabilities.81

of the simple structure,

matrix structure.

The Bureaucracy
Standardization! That is the key feature underlying all bureaucracies. Consider 
the government offices that collect taxes, enforce health regulations, and pro￾vide local fire protection. They all rely on standardized work processes for coor￾dination and control, what some have referred to colloquially as “red tape.”82
The bureaucracy is characterized by highly routine operating tasks achieved 
through specialization, formalized rules and regulations, departmentalization, 
centralized authority, narrow spans of control, and decision making that follows 
the chain of command.83 Bureaucracy incorporates all the strongest degrees of 
departmentalization described earlier.
Bureaucracy is a dirty word in many people’s minds. However, it does have 
advantages, primarily the ability to perform standardized activities very effi￾ciently. Putting like specialties together in units results in economies of scale, 
minimum duplication of people and equipment, and a common language that 
employees all share. Bureaucracies can get by with less talented—and hence less 
costly—middle- and lower-level managers because rules and regulations sub￾stitute for managerial discretion. There is little need for innovative and expe￾rienced decision makers below the level of senior executives, and innovative 
employees often do not mesh well with bureaucracy.84
Listen to this conversation among four executives in one company: “You 
know, nothing happens in this place until we produce something,” said the pro￾duction executive. “Wrong,” commented the R&D manager, “Nothing happens 
until we design something!” “What are you talking about?” asked the market￾ing executive, “Nothing happens until we sell something!” The exasperated 
accounting manager responded, “It doesn’t matter what you produce, design, 
or sell. No one knows what happens until we tally up the results!” This conversa￾tion highlights how bureaucratic specialization can create conflicts in which the 
unit perspectives override the overall goals of the organization.
The other major weakness of a bureaucracy is something many have wit￾nessed firsthand: obsessive concern with following standard procedures and 
practices. When cases do not fit “the way things are done around here” pre￾cisely, there is no room for modification. The bureaucracy is efficient only if

 Myth or Science? Bureaucracy Is the Enemy of Innovation and 
Productivity 
 S
urveys indicate that, on aver￾age, organizations are becom￾ing more bureaucratic. They are 
becoming more centralized, conserva￾tive, and rule-bound. There was a time 
when bureaucracy was considered to 
be innovative and progressive. A spe￾cialized division of labor and hierar￾chy of authority were thought to allow 
companies to expand more than they 
had before. Though many fiercely 
oppose bureaucracy—Walmart CEO Doug 
McMillon has gone as far as referring 
to it as a “villain,” and the CEO of 
JPMorgan Chase concurs that it is “a 
disease.” Yet is bureaucracy really the 
enemy of innovation and productivity, 
or is it possible for individuals to make 
bureaucracy less burdensome? 
 Research comparing bureaucratic 
expectations in two different settings 
found that employees could fulfill these 
expectations with minimal complaining 
or frustration. In other words, making 
bureaucracy work for them allowed 
employees to control the tasks that 
mattered to them. They were also able 
to do so because the bureaucracy was 
a shared burden, not an individual one. 
Rather than eliminating it altogether, 
connecting bureaucratic tasks to ben￾efits employees value can effectively 
ensure these tasks do not negatively 
impact innovation or productivity. 
 While bureaucracy can serve its 
purpose, sometimes it is necessary 
to “liberate” individuals from bureau￾cracy, particularly when it becomes 
excessive. As the CEO of Pfizer (the 
world’s largest pharmaceutical com￾pany) described, declining govern￾ment funding was essential to reduce 
the barriers of bureaucracy and pro￾tect scientists from needless delays. 
Ultimately, this allowed Pfizer to 
develop a COVID-19 vaccine in record 
time—just six months. Data suggests 
that bureaucracy can indeed be a 
time trap, with an average of 28  per￾cent of employees’ time being spent 
on bureaucratic tasks. Furthermore, 
two-thirds of respondents believe 
bureaucracy significantly decreases 
the rate of decision making. It can 
also lead to inertia within an organi￾zation and make innovation difficult. 
While companies such as Google and 
Amazon encourage bottom-up inno￾vation, there are significantly more 
organizations with more than 1,000 
employees in which employees report 
experiencing challenges when trying to 
launch new initiatives. 
 Thus, bureaucracy can certainly 
negatively impact employees’ ability to 
innovate and be productive. However, 
eliminating most bureaucratic tasks is 
often not possible or practical. On the 
other hand, bureaucracy does not nec￾essarily have to be the enemy of pro￾ductivity or innovation. If bureaucratic 
tasks are implemented in a way that 
is not overly burdensome to employ￾ees, they may help them achieve their 
goals. 88
employees confront familiar problems with programmed practices and pro￾cedures. 85 This rigid adherence to procedures and practices makes it more 
 difficult for new practices to catch on within different units in a bureaucracy. 
For instance, a social recognition program (see the chapter on motivation appli￾cation) was successful in bureaucracies in one state of Niger, Africa—but was 
completely unsuccessful in another due to its unique context and nature. 86
Moreover, the standardization and rule adherence that benefit it also result in 
additional drawbacks: Bureaucratic structures may result in diminished auton￾omy and motivation for employees within these systems, making it difficult to 
develop and maintain motivation. 87
 The Matrix Structure 
 The matrix structure combines functional and product departmentalization, 
and these types of structures can be found in a multitude of organizations, 
such as advertising agencies, universities, and entertainment companies. 89
Organizations with a matrix structure create a dual line of authority, so that 
there are multiple people accountable, depending upon their function and 
product. One survey by Gallup found that 84  percent of employees in the 
matrix structure An organizational 
structure that creates dual lines of authority 
and combines functional and product 
departmentalization. 
M15_ROBB0025_19_GE_C15.indd 526 13/12/22 3:10 AMFoundations of Organization Structure CHAPTER 15 527
United States are in matrixed organizations.90 Companies that use matrix-like 
structures include Samsung, BASF, and L’Oréal.91
The most obvious structural characteristic of the matrix is that it breaks the 
unity of command discussed earlier. Exhibit 15-5 shows the matrix for a college 
of business administration. The academic departments of accounting, decision 
and information systems, marketing, and so forth, are functional units. Overlaid 
on them are the specific programs (services). Employees in the matrix have two 
supervisors: their functional department managers and their product manag￾ers. A professor of accounting teaching an undergraduate course may report 
to the director of undergraduate programs as well as to the chairperson of the 
accounting department.
Matrices can help facilitate coordination when the organization has several 
complex and interdependent activities.92 Direct and frequent contacts between 
different specialties in the matrix can let information permeate the organiza￾tion and reach the people who need it more quickly. Consider the case of the 
terrible snow during the winter of 2018. Boston’s Logan International Airport 
was best equipped to deal with this disaster as a result of its matrix structure, 
whereas JFK was left with delays for days that made news worldwide due to 
over-delegated authority and reliance on third-party contractors.93 The matrix 
reduces so-called “bureaupathologies”—its dual lines of authority limit people’s 
tendency to protect their territories at the expense of the organization’s goals.94
A matrix also achieves economies of scale and facilitates the allocation of spe￾cialists by both providing the best resources and ensuring that they are effi￾ciently used.95
However, some disadvantages of the matrix structure lie in the confusion it 
creates, its tendency to foster power struggles, and the stress it places on individ￾uals.96 For individuals who desire security and absence from ambiguity, this struc￾ture can be stressful. Reporting to more than one boss introduces role conflict, 
and unclear expectations introduce role ambiguity. Without unity of command, 
ambiguity about who reports to whom is significantly increased and often leads 
to conflict and power struggles between functional and product managers.
Some of these disadvantages can be offset through culture (see the next 
chapter), especially one that values agility, flexibility, fluidity, collabora￾tion, and a clear direction. For example, Spotify espouses these key values

while organizing individuals into “squads,” “guilds,” “chapters,” and “tribes” 
that fulfill the mission of Spotify through so-called agile matrices.
97 Loosely 
speaking, the “tribes” and the teams that comprise them (e.g., “squads”) 
are focused on specific products or services Spotify provides. “Chapters” are 
made up of people who do similar jobs across products/services (e.g., data￾base administrators, front office developers, etc.). The cross-section of tribes 
and chapters makes up the traditional matrix, like the one shown in Exhibit 
15-5. However, where things truly get interesting is with the formation of 
“guilds.” “Guilds” are amorphous collections of members who merely share 
the same interests and want to consistently improve upon their shared inter￾ests. Organizing in this way has enabled Spotify to quickly throw together 
squads to accomplish temporary objectives without needing to worry about 
who reports to whom.
Newer Trends in Organizational Design
With the increasing trend toward flatter structures, many organizations have 
been developing alternative options with fewer layers of hierarchy and more 
emphasis on opening the boundaries of the organization.98 In this section, we 
describe three such designs: the virtual structure, the team structure, and the cir￾cular structure.
The Virtual Structure
Why own when you can rent? That question captures the essence of the virtual 
structure (also sometimes called the network structure), typically a small, core 
organization that outsources its major business functions.99 The virtual struc￾ture is highly centralized, with little or no departmentalization. These types of 
structures open up boundaries between organizations.
The prototype of the virtual structure is today’s filmmaking organization. In 
Hollywood’s golden era, movies were made by huge, vertically integrated cor￾porations. Studios such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Warner Bros., and 
20th Century Fox owned large movie lots and employed thousands of full-time 
specialists—set designers, camera people, film editors, directors, and actors. 
Today, many movies are made by a collection of individuals and small compa￾nies who come together and make films project by project. This structural form 
allows each project to be staffed with the talent best suited to its demands rather 
than just with the people employed by the studio. It minimizes bureaucratic 
overhead because there is no lasting organization to maintain. It lessens long￾term risks and their costs because there is no long term—a team is assembled 
for a finite period and then disbanded.
Recently, streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ 
have been churning out massive amounts of “original content” for their viewers. 
Although some of this content is actually exclusively licensed and not original, 
much of it is created by the streaming services.100 The virtual structure allows 
these companies to assemble content very quickly. Take for instance Yasuke, 
an anime series loosely based on the story of a samurai from Africa. Yasuke 
served as a bodyguard to daimyo Oda Nobunaga in the sixteenth century after 
arriving in Japan with an Italian Jesuit missionary. Netflix brought together a 
diverse talent pool in LeSean Thomas (the creator of Black Dynamite and The 
Boondocks) and LaKeith Stanfield (who also starred in Get Out, Sorry to Bother You, 
and Judas and the Black Messiah) as the voice of Yasuke, among others. It enlisted 
the MAPPA anime studio in Tokyo to bring the animation to life. And it signed 
the Grammy-nominated Flying Lotus for the score and opening (OP) and

that outsources major business functions.
15-3 Identify the characteristics 
of the virtual structure, the 
team structure, and the 
circular structure.

ending (ED) songs (along with the extremely talented musician, Thundercat) 
and countless other in-house and out-of-house professionals.101 Clearly, virtual 
structures enable organizations to quickly band together diverse talent to make 
stories come to life.
Exhibit 15-6 shows a virtual structure in which management outsources all 
the primary functions of the business. The core of the organization is a small 
group of executives whose job is to oversee directly any activities done in-house 
and to coordinate relationships with organizations that manufacture, distribute, 
and perform other crucial functions. The dotted lines represent the relation￾ships typically maintained under contracts. Managers in virtual structures spend 
most of their time coordinating and controlling external relations.
Network organizations often take many forms.102 Some of the more tradi￾tional forms include the franchise form, in which there are managers, systems, 
and other experts in the central node (i.e., executive group) and customer 
sales and services are carried out by franchise units. This popular form of net￾work organization is very common in service business models, such as 7-Eleven, 
McDonald’s, Jimmy John’s, and Dunkin’ Donuts. In this form, however, fran￾chisees do not tend to collaborate or coordinate with one another, are difficult 
to influence by the executive group, and may even be in direct competition for 
resources from the executive group. For instance, one study of franchises found 
that there is variability in how mission statements are formed at each franchise 
along with how well they consider ethical standards. These differences subse￾quently impact how much discrimination is experienced at each franchise.103
Moreover, there is often extreme tension between the organization’s desire for 
standardization and franchisees’ desire for business autonomy,104 which can 
contribute to differences in franchisee performance across locations.105
In the hollow form, the organization only outsources noncritical functions.106
For instance, Ascendle builds web and mobile apps for companies—although 
an organization could technically expend the resources to make these for itself, 
often it is not cost-effective and easier to outsource the job (while retaining 
critical functions like human resources in-house).107 During the COVID-19 
pandemic, which put massive demands on technology, technology support, 
and broadband capacity due to the number of people working from home, IT

outsourcing became an even bigger business, with many firms enlisting the help 
of outside IT contracting firms to handle this function.108 Similarly, a modu￾lar form enables the organization to outsource a noncritical part of a product.
Computer manufacturers like Dell do not make every single part that comprises 
their laptops and personal computers. Indeed, companies like AMD provide 
processors, AU Optronics provides the display, and IBM provides the disk stor￾age used in many Dell computers.109 Another example is the starburst form, in 
which a parent firm splits off one of its functions into a spinoff firm.110 For 
example, in 2012, Netflix split off its DVD function into a separate entity, now 
DVD.com.111 More recently, IAC planned to spin off popular video service 
Vimeo in 2021.112
Virtual structures offer flexibility that allows individuals with an innovative 
idea and little money to successfully compete against larger, more established 
organizations. The structure also saves a great deal of money by eliminating 
permanent offices and hierarchical roles for outsourced functions.113 On the 
other hand, the drawbacks have become increasingly clear as its popularity has 
grown.114 Virtual organizations are in a state of perpetual flux and reorgani￾zation, which means roles, goals, and responsibilities are unclear, setting the 
stage for increased political behavior. Looking back to the earlier example of 
the winter of 2018 snow emergency, JFK utilized more of a virtual organization 
structure, which (during crisis) limited its communication and agility.115
The Team Structure
The team structure seeks to eliminate the chain of command and replace 
departments with empowered teams.116 This structure removes most vertical 
and horizontal boundaries in addition to breaking down most external barri￾ers between the company and its customers and suppliers. Functional depart￾ments create horizontal boundaries between functions, product lines, and 
units—to reduce them, these organizations replace functional departments 
with cross-functional teams and organize activities around processes. Although 
the team structure has been called by a number of names (e.g., skunk works, 
holocracies, amoeba organizations, ambidextrous organizations, boundaryless 
organizations, meta-teams, market-oriented ecosystems), they all share the same 
properties: (1) They set aside a platform of resources (e.g., people, technol￾ogy, money) dedicated to market opportunities, (2) leaders assign independent 
teams to each market opportunity, and (3) these teams are empowered to antici￾pate customers’ needs and demands and respond with agility and speed.117
By removing bureaucratic roadblocks to success, management flattens the 
hierarchy and minimizes status and rank. A recent review of nearly fourteen 
thousand teams suggests that hierarchy can engender conflict that can, in turn, 
limit the effectiveness of teams.118 Cross-hierarchical teams (which include 
top executives, middle managers, supervisors, and operative employees), par￾ticipative decision-making practices, and the use of 360-degree performance 
appraisals (in which peers and others evaluate performance) can be used. For 
example, at the Danish firm Oticon, the world’s largest hearing aid manufac￾turer, all traces of hierarchy have disappeared.119 Everyone works at uniform 
mobile workstations, and project teams, not functions or departments, coordi￾nate work.
Many organizations have adopted the team structure in all or part of its 
structure. Xerox, for instance, develops new products through multidisciplinary 
teams that work on a single process instead of on narrow functional tasks.120
Skunk Works teams, like those used by Lockheed Martin, work in focused isola￾tion with a trusting project leader relying on diverse talent to drive breakthrough 
innovation in short amounts of time.121 Apart from these examples, some 
team structure An organizational structure 
that replaces departments with empowered 
teams and that eliminates most horizontal 
boundaries and external barriers between 
customers and suppliers.
M15_ROBB0025_19_GE_C15.indd 530 13/12/22 3:10 AMFoundations of Organization Structure CHAPTER 15 531
organizations take the team structure approach as a cardinal characteristic of 
their culture and structure (see the chapter on culture and change) . Amazon, 
for instance, describes itself as a “Day 1 culture.” Employees “obsess over the 
customer and their needs,” maintain a long-term focus, and boldly innovate to 
meet those needs. The team structure meets this need and leaves behind rigid 
structures that are slow, bureaucratic, and authoritative (what Amazon refers 
to as “Day 2 cultures”) for those that are innovative, agile, and empowering to 
teams. 122
 When fully operational, the team structure may break down geographic 
barriers. Today, many companies, like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, do as much 
business overseas as in the United States, and some struggle to incorporate 
geographic regions into their structure. In other cases, the team approach is 
need-based. Such is the case with Chinese companies, which made ninety-three 
acquisitions in the oil and gas industry in five years—incorporating each acqui￾sition as a new team unit—to meet forecasted demand that their resources in 
China could not meet. 123 Some organizations create teams incorporating their 
employees and their customers or suppliers. For example, to ensure that impor￾tant product parts are made reliably and to exacting specifications by its sup￾pliers, Honeywell International partners some of its engineers with managers 
at those suppliers. The team structure provides a solution because it considers 
geography as more of a tactical, logistical issue than a structural one. In short, 
the goal may be to break down cultural barriers and open opportunities.

change, so do their physical environ￾ments. Many organizations have been 
trying to make the physical environ￾ment reflect the organizational struc￾tures they adopt. 
 At online retailer Zappos, not even 
the CEO wants an office. All four￾teen hundred employees are wel￾come throughout the open spaces 
(although many worked from home 
during the COVID-19 pandemic). Firms 
like Google have workplace designs of 
public rooms with lounge areas and 
large, multiperson tables. According to 
Edward Danyo, former manager of work￾place strategy at pharmaceuticals firm 
GlaxoSmithKline, shared environments 
create efficient work gains, including 
an increase in the speed of decision 
making. But there are ethical concerns 
about the dismantling of the physical 
and mental organizational structure: 
• Where will confidential discussions 
take place? In some contemporary 
workplace designs, ad hoc confer￾ence rooms address the need for 
separate gatherings. This may not 
be optimal if the walls are made 
of glass, if employees will feel stig￾matized when called into a meeting 
room, or if they become reluctant to 
approach HR staff with issues be￾cause of privacy concerns. 
• How can differences in personality 
traits be overcome? Employees high 
in extroversion will be more comfort￾able building collaborative relation￾ships without assigned workspaces. 
In contrast, introverted individuals 
may be uncomfortable without an 
established office structure to get 
to know others over time. 
• How can personal privacy be main￾tained? Zappos gives employees 
personal lockers, asks employees 
to angle laptop screens away from 
neighbors, and tries to make open 
spaces more private by encouraging 
earbuds to create a sound barrier 
between working employees. 
• How can you assure your clients 
about confidentiality? Even walled, 
soundproof rooms for virtual or live 
meetings may not provide the de￾sired level of security for clients who 
need to know their business will 
stay on a need-to-know basis. 
• How will expectations and account￾abilities be enforced? In an environ￾ment without offices and sometimes 
without job titles, there is an even 
greater need for clearly assigned 
goals, roles, and expectations. Oth￾erwise, open, collaborative struc￾tures may foster the diffusion of re￾sponsibility and confusion. 124

The Circular Structure
Picture the concentric rings of an archery target (see Exhibit 15-7). In the cen￾ter is the CEO, followed by the executives on the top management team (TMT), 
and radiating outward in rings grouped by function are the directors and then 
the specialists and workers. This is the circular structure.
125 Note that the circu￾lar structure is virtually identical to the simple, vertical, hierarchical structures 
we have seen earlier in this chapter.126 The differences can be found in the 
way the information is conveyed—instead of conveying hierarchy as a top-down 
chain of command, the circular structure is meant to rebrand this perception 
into one that sees the organization more as a team with top management at 
the very heart of the organization and its vision spreading outward. Moreover, 
segments in the circular structure are less defined than the clear, point-to-point 
linkages in the simple structure.
The circular structure has intuitive appeal for creative entrepreneurs, and 
some small innovative firms have claimed it. As in many of the current hybrid 
approaches, however, employees are apt to be unclear about whom they report 
to and who is running the show, especially without clear linkages between peo￾ple in each “band.” The concept may still have intuitive appeal for spreading a 
vision, such as executives whose firms are primarily focused on corporate social 
responsibility (CSR), for instance.
The Leaner Organization: Downsizing
The goal of some organizational structures we have described is to improve agil￾ity by creating a lean, focused, and flexible organization. Downsizing is a system￾atic effort to make an organization leaner by closing locations, reducing staff, 
or selling off business units that do not add value.127 Downsizing might also 
involve de-layering, or narrowing the span of control by reducing the number of 
levels in a hierarchy. Downsizing does not necessarily mean physically shrinking 
the size of your office, although that has been happening, too (see OB Poll), 
circular structure An organizational 
structure in which executives are at the 
center, spreading their vision outward in 
rings grouped by function (managers, then 
specialists, then workers).

especially in the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic (although, fewer people in 
the office means the office space per worker actually went up in 2020—to 196 
square feet!). 128
 Although we frame it here as a strategic structuring decision, many firms 
do not have a choice and implement downsizing measures because of outside 
forces. For example, organizations may engage in downsizing along with work 
restructuring, wage, and employment freezes during times of natural disaster, 
pandemics (like the COVID-19 pandemic), and economic recessions. 129 For 
instance, CEOs often feel pressure to meet earnings estimates, which can then 
prompt downsizing. 130 Sometimes it is done for more nefarious reasons. For 
instance, one study found that CEOs who are paid less than their peers may 
be more likely to engage in layoffs and, following the layoffs, are more likely to 
receive pay increases if the firm performs better as a result. 131
 Some firms downsize to direct all their efforts toward their core competen￾cies. Therefore, downsizing is a type of lean management technique (i.e., one that 
identifies and eliminates activity that is not valued by the customer or end user) 
to reduce bureaucracy and speed decision making. 132 American Express claims 
to have been doing this in a series of layoffs over more than a decade: Each layoff 
has been accompanied by a restructuring to reflect changing customer prefer￾ences away from personal customer service and toward online customer service. 
According to former CEO Ken Chennault, “Our business and industry continue 
to become transformed by technology. Because of these changes, we have the 
need and the opportunity to evolve our organization and cost structure.” 131
 Despite the advantages of being a lean organization, the impact of 
downsizing on organizational performance is not without controversy. 134
Reducing the size of the workforce perhaps has positive outcomes in the 
long run, although most of the evidence suggests that downsizing has a neg￾ative impact on stock returns the year of downsizing (although this may be 
contingent on the organization’s goals for downsizing along with other con￾textual factors). 135 An example of these contingencies can be found in the 
case of Russia’s Gorky Automobile Factory (GAZ), which realized a profit for 
the first time in many years after Bo Andersson fired fifty thousand workers,

half the workforce.136 Eventually, however, the rampant downsizing policy 
caught up with Andersson when he was CEO of Russia’s largest car maker, 
AvtoVAZ. From 2014 to 2016, downsizing at its plant in Togliatti led to tens 
of thousands of workers losing their jobs. At the time, Sergei Chemezov, an 
ally of President Vladmir Putin, told Andersson that he was “playing with 
fire.”137 Eventually, Andersson was removed as CEO for his tactics in 2016—
what tended to be standard practice in the West (downsizing) was frowned 
upon in Russia, where the auto industry is revered with nationalistic pride 
and jobs tend to be preserved rather than cut.138
Part of the problem is the effect of downsizing on employee attitudes.139
From a broad perspective, many have argued that the prominence of down￾sizing has led employees across the world to be insecure about their jobs and 
uncertain about their careers.140 Employees who remain often feel worried 
about future layoffs, may be less committed to the organization, and may experi￾ence a greater amount of stress and strain.141 Downsizing can also lead to vol￾untary turnover, so vital human capital is lost.142 The result is a company that is 
more anemic than lean. Paradoxically, some research suggests that the victims 
may even fare better than the survivors, experiencing higher control percep￾tions and less stress.143
Companies can reduce the negative impact of downsizing by preparing in 
advance, thus alleviating some employee stress and strengthening support for 
the new direction. Here are some effective strategies for downsizing:
• Invest. Companies that downsize to focus on core competencies are more 
effective when they invest in high-involvement work practices afterward.
• Communicate. When employers make efforts to discuss downsizing with 
employees early, employees are less worried about the outcomes and feel 
the company is taking their perspective into account.
• Participate. Employees worry less if they can participate in the process in 
some way. Voluntary early-retirement programs or severance packages can 
help achieve leanness without layoffs.
• Assist. Severance, extended health care benefits, and job search assistance 
demonstrate that a company cares about its employees and honors their 
contributions.
In short, companies that make themselves lean can be more agile, effi￾cient, and productive—but only if they make cuts carefully and help employees 
through the process.
Why Do Structures Differ?
Exhibit 15-8 differentiates between two extreme models of organizational 
design.144 One model is the mechanistic model, which is generally synonymous 
with the bureaucracy in that it has highly standardized processes for work, high 
formalization, and more managerial hierarchy. The other extreme is the organic 
model, which is flat, has fewer formal procedures for making decisions, has mul￾tiple decision makers, and favors flexible practices.145 Whether the organization 
is more mechanistic or organic has implications for which behaviors are most 
effective.146 For example, research suggests that political behaviors (see the 
chapter on power and politics) tend to be more effective in mechanistic orga￾nizations,144 whereas transformational leadership and empowerment (see the 
chapter on leadership) tend to be more effective in organic organizations.148
With these two models in mind, why are some organizations more mechanistic 
whereas others are more organic? What forces influence the choice of design? In this 
section, we present major causes or determinants of an organization’s structure.149
mechanistic model A structure 
characterized by extensive 
departmentalization, high formalization, 
a limited information network, and 
centralization.
organic model A structure that is flat, 
uses cross-hierarchical and cross-functional 
teams, has low formalization, possesses a 
comprehensive information network, and 
relies on participative decision making.
15-5 Contrast the reasons for 
using mechanistic versus 
organic structural models.
M15_ROBB0025_19_GE_C15.indd 534 13/12/22 3:10 AMFoundations of Organization Structure CHAPTER 15 535
Organizational Strategies
Because structure is a means to achieve objectives and objectives derive from the 
organization’s overall strategy, it is only logical that structure should follow strat￾egy. If management significantly changes the organization’s strategy or its values, 
the structure must change to accommodate. For example, recent research indi￾cates that aspects of organizational culture may influence the success of CSR ini￾tiatives.150 If the culture is supported by the structure, the initiatives are more 
likely to have clear paths toward application. Regarding strategy, most current 
strategy frameworks focus on three strategy dimensions—innovation, cost mini￾mization, and imitation—and the structural design that works best with each.151
Innovation Strategy To what degree does an organization introduce major new 
products or services? An innovation strategy strives to achieve meaningful and 
unique innovations.152 Innovative firms use competitive pay and benefits to 
attract top candidates and motivate employees to take risks. Some degree of the 
mechanistic structure can benefit innovation. Well-developed communication 
channels, policies for enhancing long-term commitment, and clear channels of 
authority all may make it easier for rapid changes to occur smoothly. Obviously, 
not all firms pursue innovation. Tesla, Amazon, and Netflix do,150 but some 
other firms do not.
Arguably, some degree of innovation is needed if the firm is to stay ahead of 
the competition. We can recall several instances in which companies failed to 
innovate, causing them to lose position in the market (e.g., Kodak, Blockbuster, 
etc.).154 Steve Sasson invented the first digital camera in 1975. While working 
as an engineer at Kodak, Sasson took the camera to show management; their 
response was “That’s cute—but don’t tell anyone about it.” Former Kodak exec￾utives noted that although they developed this, leadership was too focused on 
the success of film to notice the digital revolution and too afraid of how this 
innovation would affect the film market.155 However, sometimes innovation 
does not work out in the face of competitors. For instance, Myspace’s response 
to Facebook’s popularity in the mid-2000s was to change its niche to entertain￾ment and music, eventually leading to its decline as a social network.156

Cost-Minimization Strategy An organization pursuing a cost-minimization strat￾egy tightly controls costs, refrains from incurring unnecessary expenses, and 
cuts prices. 158 For example, India’s Jet Airways did away with the first-class sec￾tion in its Boeing 777 planes, enabling it to increase revenue by adding an addi￾tional fifty-four seats per plane in 2019. 159 But sometimes, cost minimization

 Toward a Better World 
 Grove Collaborative: Innovating in the CSR 
and Sustainability Market Space 
 Organizations approach CSR and sus￾tainability in many different ways. 
Some organizations tack social respon￾sibility initiatives onto their mission 
almost like a peripheral vision, pri￾marily if the organization’s products 
or services do not intrinsically involve 
CSR. Other organizations may offer a 
product or service that does lend well 
to CSR initiatives. They build it into the 
fabric of the product or service they 
offer. But are there organizations that 
pride themselves on developing multi￾ple CSR-relevant products, adopting an 
innovation strategy to realize that aim? 
 Enter Grove Collaborative, a com￾pany that develops and offers a suite 
of sustainable products for customers 
and was recently ranked as the number 
two most socially responsible innova￾tive company in 2021 by Fast Company . 
As one of its mottos states: “Change 
starts at home—ours and yours.” As a 
certified B corporation, it is committed 
to being a one-stop shop for purchasing 
everyday household products suitable 
for environmental and human health. 
Specifically, it focuses on its impact 
on plastic, trees, and carbon emis￾sions. Although it offers products from 
other sustainable companies (e.g., Dr. 
Brommer’s, Method), it also offers its 
own products organized into four prod￾uct divisions: household cleaning, per￾sonal care, baby & childcare, and pets. 
To make it easier for consumers to reg￾ularly use the products it offers, Grove 
provides a subscription service model 
(similar to Amazon’s subscriptions). 
With this model, consumers can sub￾scribe to their favorite Grove products 
to be delivered at regular intervals. 
 Have its structure and strategy 
been successful? To date, Grove 
Collaborative has been growing by 
leaps and bounds. In 2020, it made 
more than $250  million in total reve￾nue from over two million customers, 
representing a 5,000  percent growth 
since 2016. As of 2020, it was valued 
at $1.32 billion and has raised more 
than $125  million from investors. Its 
wild success has led to several pro￾ductive partnerships. For instance, 
it has recently partnered with Target, 
expanding into physical retail through 
a curated collection of its best-selling 
products. The partnership with Target 
was a strategic decision, allowing Grove 
to reach more customers and give it 
the ability to reach 90 to 95  percent 
of the market. As Stuart Landesberg 
(cofounder and CEO) noted, “When we 
think about what it means to manifest 
[our] vision of changing the category, 
it really is about expanding access as 
much as it is about innovation . . . We’re 
already the market leader in vertical 
e-commerce, but the majority of the 
market is still purchasing through more 
traditional formats, like Target.” 
 Strategy and financials aside, Grove 
Collaborative has been successful in 
achieving what it set out to achieve. 
Its triple-bottom-line approach toward 
making a positive impact on plastic, 
trees, and carbon has enjoyed many 
successes to date. For instance, Grove 
has set an ambitious move of becom￾ing plastic-free by 2025—in fact, it is 
currently the first plastic neutral retailer 
in the world. To do this, it is converting 
to more eco-friendly packaging (e.g., 
glass, aluminum). Through a boundary￾spanning initiative, it has formed a 
collaborative community of sixty-three 
suppliers to share best practices in 
going plastic-free. For those who do not 
cut plastic, Grove passes a “fee” or 
“tax” on to its suppliers to offset their 
use of plastic packaging. These efforts 
prevented two million pounds of plastic 
from entering landfills, prevented four 
million pounds of plastic from reaching 
consumers’ hands, and led to recycling 
5.3  million pounds of ocean-bound 
plastic. Beyond its monumental plastic 
goals, it has implemented similar ones 
with trees (e.g., planting one million 
trees by 2022) and carbon. In fact, it is 
already 100 percent carbon-neutral in 
its shipping and facilities. 
 Overall, the case of Grove 
Collaborative demonstrates how an 
innovation strategy can be adopted 
in the sustainability space on a large 
scale. It also demonstrates how bound￾ary spanning can help organizations 
brainstorm and innovate to address 
significant sustainability challenges 
rather than work in isolated “silos.” 
We will likely hear more about Grove 
Collaborative as it continues to grow 
in size and market share, and we may 
even see similar companies come into 
the works. 157

author notes).160 But even further, sometimes the public is unaware of these 
cost-cutting measures or remains “blissfully ignorant,” as is the case with his￾torical ethical and quality concerns levied against major American meat suppli￾ers.161 Regardless, with the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence 
(AI), thought leaders have proposed a new philosophy that is not so focused on 
price cutting.162 This strategy, cost optimization, focuses on looking at the bigger 
picture and making sure expenditures maximize long-term growth and profits. 
AI can empower organizations to quickly collect, process, and learn from moun￾tains of data, all while forecasting future returns.
Imitation Strategy Organizations following an imitation strategy try to minimize 
risk and maximize opportunity for profit, moving new products or entering new 
markets only after innovators have proven their viability.163 On a smaller scale, 
companies within the same industry share best practices and benchmarking data 
in order to advance the industry. More overt imitation strategies suggest organiza￾tions follow smaller and more innovative competitors with superior products but 
only after competitors have demonstrated that a market is there. Executives in these 
organizations assess the costs of imitation and the opportunity costs for moving late 
and may even outsource to copy quickly, even if the costs are prohibitive.164
One modern example is how Instagram released its own version of “Stories,” 
a feature nearly identical to the one Snapchat introduced: Since its release, 
Instagram added 250 million users.165 Moreover, larger companies (especially 
those in the tech industry) will often move to acquire smaller companies that 
have “proved the concept,” paving the way for moving the strategy forward with 
more capital and resources.166
However, the imitation strategy does have its drawbacks. As some examples 
indicate, imitation can be an extreme risk that causes firms to imitate the effects 
of success rather than its causes, imitation often ignores the luck and seren￾dipity that caused the imitated to become successful, and imitation can lead 
to long-term decline if the imitating company does not have the capacity or 
resources to scale.167 Interestingly, there appears to be an ethical component 
as well: Imitation can lead some companies today to get a “bad reputation” for 
partnering up with firms, learning from them, and then “stabbing them in the 
back” once they have developed their own version of the product or service.168
Structural Matches Exhibit 15-9 describes the structural option that best 
matches each strategy. Innovators need the flexibility of the organic structure 
(although, as we noted, they may use some elements of the mechanistic structure 
as well), whereas cost minimizers seek the efficiency and stability of the mecha￾nistic structure. Imitators combine the two structures. They use a mechanistic 
imitation strategy A strategy that seeks to 
move into new products or new markets only 
after their viability has already been proven.
Exhibit 15-9 The Strategy–Structure Relationship
Strategy Structural Option
Innovation Organic: A loose structure; low specialization, low formalization,
decentralized
Cost minimization Mechanistic: Tight control; extensive work specialization, high
formalization, high centralization
Imitation Mechanistic and organic: Mix of loose with tight properties; tight
controls over current activities and looser controls for new
undertakings

structure to maintain tight controls and low costs in their current activities but 
create organic subunits in which to pursue new undertakings.
Organization Size
An organization’s size significantly affects its structure.169 Organizations that 
employ two thousand or more people tend to have more specialization, more 
departmentalization, more vertical levels, and more rules and regulations than 
do small organizations. However, size becomes less important as an organization 
expands. Why? At around two thousand employees, an organization is already 
mechanistic; five hundred more employees should not have much of an impact. 
But adding five hundred employees to an organization of only three hundred is 
likely to significantly shift it toward a more mechanistic structure.
Technology
Technology describes the way an organization transfers inputs into outputs.170
Every organization has at least one technology for converting financial, human, 
and physical resources into products or services (think of the Ben & Jerry’s exam￾ple earlier in the chapter). Regardless, organizational structures adapt to their 
technology—and vice versa. Organizational structure and culture can become 
inscribed in the data structure, software, and hardware that an organization 
uses.171 Moreover, as we described in depth in the chapter on communication, the 
advent of social media has changed the way that employees, leaders, executives, cli￾ents, customers, and the public at large communicate with one another. This form 
of technology has revolutionized how companies market to consumers, recruit tal￾ent, and create a digital presence in a technologically transformed world.
Environment
An organization’s environment includes outside institutions or forces that can 
affect its structure, such as suppliers, customers, competitors, and public pres￾sure groups.172 Dynamic environments create significantly more uncertainty for 
managers than do static ones. To minimize uncertainty in key market arenas, 
managers may broaden their structure to sense and respond to threats. For 
example, most companies have added social media departments to find and 
respond to negative information (e.g., reviews) posted online.173
Any organization’s environment has three dimensions: capacity, volatility, 
and complexity.174 Let us discuss each separately.
Capacity Capacity refers to the degree that the environment can support growth. 
Rich and growing environments generate excess resources that can buffer the orga￾nization in times of relative scarcity. One example of how capacity plays a role in stra￾tegic decisions is how Amazon sought to build a second headquarters in a major U.S. 
city, considering several environmental factors (including capacity) in its decision.175
Volatility Volatility describes the degree of instability in the environment. 
A dynamic environment with a high degree of unpredictable change makes it diffi￾cult for management to make accurate predictions. Because information technol￾ogy changes at such a rapid pace, most organizations’ environments are becom￾ing volatile. The characteristics of firms, their teams, and their leaders often affect 
how well firms weather the storms of volatility.176 For example, research on top 
executives in China points to the Chinese concept of negotiable fate (i.e., the belief 
that personal actions can shape outcomes); when executives hold this belief, they 
tend to be more entrepreneurial in how they approach volatility, which in turn 
predicts their firms’ innovation and financial performance.177 Moreover, airlines

organization that potentially affect the 
organization’s structure.

that choose strategic flexibility are more likely to succeed in unpredictable, turbu￾lent environments than those that prioritize mechanistic efficiency.178
Complexity Finally, complexity is the degree of heterogeneity and concentration 
among environmental elements. Environments characterized by heterogeneity 
and dispersion are complex and diverse, with numerous competitors. For exam￾ple, information security firms operate in an incredibly complex environment: 
Competitors are widely dispersed and different from one another, the way people 
interact with technology and the Internet is diverse, and adversaries (e.g., attackers, 
hackers, and cyber-criminals) also use several methods to complete their work.179
Three-Dimensional Model of the Environment Exhibit 15-10 summarizes our 
definition of the environment along its three dimensions. The arrows indi￾cate movement toward higher uncertainty. Thus, organizations that operate in 
environments characterized as scarce, dynamic, and complex face the greatest 
degree of uncertainty because they have high unpredictability, little room for 
error, and a diverse set of elements in the environment to monitor constantly.
Given this three-dimensional definition of environment, we can offer some 
general conclusions about environmental uncertainty and structural arrange￾ments. The more scarce, dynamic, and complex the environment, the more 
organic a structure should be. The more abundant, stable, and simple the envi￾ronment, the more the mechanistic structure will be preferred.
Institutions
Another factor that shapes organizational structure is institutions. These are cul￾tural factors that act as guidelines for appropriate behavior.180 Institutional theory 
describes some of the forces that lead many organizations to have similar struc￾tures and, unlike the theories we have described so far, focuses on pressures that 
are not necessarily adaptive. In fact, many institutional theorists try to highlight 
the ways in which corporate behaviors sometimes seem to be performance-oriented 
but are really guided by unquestioned social norms and conformity.
The most obvious institutional factors come from regulatory pressures; certain 
industries under government contracts, for instance, must have clear reporting 
relationships and strict information controls. Sometimes simple inertia deter￾mines an organizational form—companies can be structured in a particular way 
just because that is the way things have always been done or what others are doing.

those factors that might not lead to adaptive 
consequences, that lead many organizations

Organizations in countries with high power distance might have a structural form 
with strict authority relationships because it is seen as more legitimate in that cul￾ture. Some have attributed problems in adaptability in Japanese organizations to 
the institutional pressure to maintain authority relationships.
Sometimes organizations start to have a particular structure because of fads or 
trends. Organizations can try to copy other successful companies just to look good 
to investors and not because they need that structure to perform better. Consider 
the “cola wars,” for instance—so many of Coca-Cola’s brands have direct Pepsi com￾petitors (Diet Coke? Diet Pepsi. Coca-Cola Cherry? Pepsi Wild Cherry. Fanta? Slice. 
Sprite? Sierra Mist. Mellow Yellow? Mountain Dew, and so on). Institutional pressures 
are often difficult to see specifically because we take them for granted. They become 
a form of bounded rationality where the norms and routines become so entrenched 
that it is difficult to see the big picture and question the way things are done, which 
can result in stagnation and may ultimately lead to some organizations’ downfall if 
they cannot adapt or if an innovating company disrupts their business model.
Organizational Designs and Employee 
Behavior
We opened this chapter by implying that an organization’s structure can have 
significant effects on its members. What might those effects be? A review of the 
evidence leads to a pretty clear conclusion:181 You cannot generalize! Not every￾one prefers the freedom and flexibility of organic structures. Several factors stand 
out in different structures as well. In highly formalized, heavily structured mecha￾nistic organizations, the level of fairness in formal policies and procedures (orga￾nizational justice) is a very important predictor of satisfaction. In more personal, 
individually adaptive organic organizations, employees value interpersonal justice 
more.182 Some people are most productive and satisfied when work tasks are stan￾dardized and ambiguity is minimized—that is, in mechanistic structures. So any 
discussion of the effect of organizational design on employee behavior should 
address individual differences. To do so, let us consider employee preferences for 
work specialization, span of control, and centralization.183
Span of Control
It is probably safe to say that no evidence supports a relationship between span 
of control and employee satisfaction or performance. Although it is intuitively 
attractive that large spans might lead to higher employee performance because 
they provide more distant supervision and more opportunity for personal ini￾tiative, there is a lack of research to support this notion.184 Some people like 
to be left alone; others prefer the security of a supervisor who is always quickly 
available. Consistent with several of the contingency theories of leadership (see 
the chapter on leadership), we would expect factors such as employees’ experi￾ences and abilities and the degree of structure in their tasks to explain when 
wide or narrow spans of control are likely to contribute to performance and job 
satisfaction. However, some evidence indicates that large spans of control are 
related to more unsafe behaviors and accidents in the workplace.185
Centralization
We also find evidence linking centralization and job satisfaction.186 In general, less 
centralized organizations have a greater amount of autonomy. But, again, while one 
employee may value freedom, another may find autonomous environments frustrat￾ingly ambiguous.
15-6 Analyze the behavioral 
implications of different 
organizational designs.

Predictability Versus Autonomy
We can draw one obvious insight: People do not select employers randomly. 
They are attracted to, are selected by, and stay with organizations that suit their 
personal characteristics.187 Job candidates who prefer predictability are likely to 
seek out and take employment in mechanistic structures, and those who want 
autonomy are more likely to end up in organic structures. Thus, the effect of 
structure on employee behavior is undoubtedly reduced when the selection 
process facilitates proper matching of individual characteristics with organiza￾tional characteristics. Companies should strive to establish, promote, and main￾tain the unique identity of their structures because skilled employees may quit 
because of dramatic changes.188
National Culture
Research suggests that national culture influences the preference for struc￾ture.189 Organizations that operate with people from high-power-distance 
cultures, such as Greece, France, and most of Latin America, often find their 
employees are much more accepting of mechanistic structures than are employ￾ees from low-power-distance countries. So consider cultural differences along 
with individual differences when predicting how structure will affect employee 
performance and satisfaction. The changing landscape of organizational struc￾ture designs has implications for the individual progressing on a career path. 
Research with managers in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States 
indicated that employees who weathered downsizing and resulting hybrid 
organizational structures considered their future career prospects diminished. 
While this may or may not have been correct, their thinking shows that organi￾zational structure does affect the employee and thus must be designed carefully 
across cultures.
The theme of this chapter is that an organization’s internal structure con￾tributes to explaining and predicting behavior. That is, in addition to indi￾vidual and group factors, the structural relationships in which people work 
have a bearing on employee attitudes and behavior. What is the basis for this 
argument? To the degree that an organization’s structure reduces ambiguity 
for employees and answers questions such as “What am I supposed to do?,” 
“How am I supposed to do it?,” “To whom do I report?,” and “To whom do I 
go if I have a problem?,” it shapes their attitudes and facilitates and motivates 
them to higher levels of performance. Exhibit 15-11 summarizes what we have 
discussed.

Summary
Organizational structure affects how people communicate with one another 
and how members of the organization execute the organization’s strategy and 
mission. In this chapter, we discussed several characteristics of organizational 
structure that influence communication, power dynamics, and the work to be 
completed. Moreover, we discussed several different organizational structures, 
from the traditional, simple structure to the more modern team structure. 
Notably, these structures tend to vary in the degree that they are organic or 
mechanistic. Next, we discussed various strategies organizations employ to ad￾vance their mission. First, we discussed downsizing and lean management as 
a way organizations cut costs and stay focused on their goals. However, most 
modern research suggests that downsizing may negatively impact employee 
attitudes and performance despite its short-term benefits for financial perfor￾mance. Other organizations adopt strategies that are aligned with their mission, 
including innovation, cost minimization, and imitation. We close by discussing 
external characteristics that affect organizational structure and strategy, in￾cluding the organization’s size, technology, the environment, and institutional 
pressures.
Implications for Managers
● Structure follows strategy. Work backward from your organization’s strat￾egy and mission to determine the appropriate structure.
● Consider the key elements of organizations (e.g., departmentalization, 
specialization) when determining the appropriate structure. Some el￾ements (e.g., chain of command, span of control, [de]centralization, 
boundary spanning) have unique implications for how employees and 
managers interact with one another.
● Many traditional structures are still used today (e.g., simple, bureaucracy, 
matrix). Moreover, many modern structures are heavily informed by these 
structures or use elements of these as micro-structures for particular divi￾sions, departments, or units.
● If there are many cost-prohibitive functions that your organization must imple￾ment that would be difficult to perform in-house, consider a virtual structure.
● Many modern organizations today have shifted to an organic team struc￾ture, which allows for greater flexibility and empowers teams to realize the 
organization’s mission. However, even mechanistic bureaucracies have 
their place if the goal is entirely standardized functions and outputs. It is 
important not to get swept up in trends and instead focus on the mission, 
strategy, and environment and structure the organization accordingly.
● Although sometimes downsizing is necessary and can lead to short-term 
cost reductions, weigh the decision to downsize wisely, as it can negatively 
affect the employees and morale.
● Depending on your organization’s mission, innovation, cost-minimization, 
or imitation strategies (among others) could be adopted. However, real￾ize that strategy often changes as a function of environmental pressures 
or opportunities. Flexible organizational structures enable flexible adap￾tation. This becomes more difficult the larger and more institutionalized 
organizations become.

 Open-Air Offices Inspire Creativity and Enhance Productivity 
POINT 
E
ric Prum, cofounder of W&P Design in Brooklyn, New York, and 
his twelve coworkers share a single room on the fourth floor of 
an open-air, converted warehouse. Although it can occasionally 
be noisy, the layout has led to some very productive brainstorming 
sessions. In fact, their latest project, ¡Buenos Nachos!, was a direct 
result of the open-air office plan. The cofounders were discussing the 
idea for a hipster nacho cookbook in the office while the coworkers 
eavesdropped. What turned into a spontaneous idea quickly became 
a productive brainstorming session. From this open-air plan emerged 
a cookbook with over 75 recipes from famous chefs and celebrities, 
including Bill Hader, Andrew Zimmern, and Rachael Ray. 
 Aside from cost minimization, the logic of the open-air office is 
that it is meant to tear down the physical barriers between people 
in the workplace. The functional communication among employees 
is maximized when these barriers are removed. Starting with the or￾ganization’s functional goals in mind, an open-air workplace can be 
tailored so that it accomplishes these goals by setting aside certain 
areas or spaces so that they are well suited to accomplish specific 
functions (e.g., a meeting area, a reading area, etc.). For example, the 
New York branding firm Collins altered aspects of the environment to 
work around any limitations of an open-air office, including arranging 
the tables so that no person faces another employee. Overall, Collins 
found, in its own internal research, that the open-air office improves a 
sense of shared vision and mission, community, and creativity percep￾tions. Additional research also suggests that these open-air plans can 
reduce the amount of time spent in meetings. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 Our new, modern Tribeca office was beautifully airy, and yet re￾markably oppressive. Nothing was private. On the first day, I 
took my seat at the table assigned to our creative department, 
next to a nice woman who I suspect was an air horn in a former life. 
All day, there was constant shuffling, yelling, and laughing, along with 
loud music piped through a PA system.” The picture Lindsey Kaufman, 
a Brooklyn advertising professional, described highlights the strain 
and dissatisfaction employees in open-air office environments can 
experience, even when there are cubicles granting at least some pri￾vacy. The creator of the cubicle, Robert Probst, envisioned something 
very different in 1964: a free space where employees could customize 
their workplace to accommodate their level of privacy, space needs, 
and flexibility to give them a sense of autonomy in an open office. This 
“action office” became mass-produced and limited in size, quality, 
and customizability, leading to what we would now call the modern￾day cubicle. 
 Studies on the open-air office and the confinement cubicles of 
modern offices paint a dismal picture of their effectiveness. One study 
reviewing hundreds of office environments found that, despite their 
cohesion benefits, open-air offices reduced workers’ attention spans, 
productivity, creative thinking, and satisfaction. One of the biggest fac￾tors responsible is the level of noise, which leads to decreased moti￾vation and potential posture issues. The satisfaction levels related to 
noise, sound privacy, and ease of interaction, among others, across 
42,764 observations from over three hundred office buildings were 
analyzed by researchers using the Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) 
database from the University of California at Berkeley. They found a 
clear disparity between satisfaction in open offices versus private of￾fices and drastically more satisfaction with the latter. And they found 
that ease of interaction (a goal of open-office plans) was no greater in 
open offices than in private offices. 190

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
Knowing the ins and outs of the structure of your orga￾nization can help you improve your employability in the 
future. You can improve how you make strategic and ethi￾cal decisions, along with how you collaborate and com￾municate with others in the workplace. Different forms 
of organizational structure have various consequences for 
employee, manager, and customer behaviors; recognizing 
these effects can help you behave more adaptively. Per￾haps someday, you will be starting your own organization 
from the ground up, or you may collaborate to restructure 
or redesign the work in an organization. Understanding 
these different forms of structure will help you improve 
your skills for use in those situations.
In this chapter, you improved your leadership and col￾laboration skills by critically evaluating the bureaucracy 
structure’s effects on innovation and productivity, examin￾ing the ethical impact of deskless workplaces, demonstrat￾ing how socially responsible companies can adopt innova￾tion strategies, and debating the utility of open-air offices. 
In the next section, you will develop these skills, along with 
your critical thinking and creativity, by designing a remote 
work–friendly organizational structure, debating how to 
approach downsizing ethically, and considering the case 
of United Airlines along with the impact its organizational 
structure had on organizational outcomes.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Remote Work
Create groups of four and read the following background 
information:
As the executive team at an organization, you have de￾cided to provide employees with the option to work re￾motely. However, as a team, you need to reach a consen￾sus about the structures and systems needed for remote 
work to be successful.
• What will the remote work policy look like? For 
example, will employees be given the option to 
work remotely full-time, primarily, or hybrid? Will 
all employees, regardless of experience or length of 
employment, be allowed to work remotely? Can teams 
work together that are composed of both remote and 
on-site employees?
• What type of training will need to be offered to pre￾pare employees for remote work?
• Which human resource policies will need to be up￾dated? For example, will changes need to be made to 
existing policies concerning compensation decisions, 
benefit programs, or recruiting strategies?
After completing the exercise, answer the following 
questions.
Questions
15-7. Did you encounter any challenges as you tried to 
reach a consensus about what structures and sys￾tems needed to be in place to make remote work 
successful? Explain.
15-8. Are there any other systems and structures that 
you believe need to be in place before imple￾menting a remote work policy? Explain.
ETHICAL DILEMMA The Ethics of Layoffs
The executives at the electronics company Catron are 
faced with a difficult decision. The organization has 
weathered consistently poor performance as of late. As a 
result, the executives believe that they must significantly 
downsize. During a meeting of senior executives, they dis￾cuss the best way to handle the situation. The executives 
agree that the most logical way of deciding who will be 
let go is to use position and tenure as the main criteria. 
One executive remarked, “Last hired, first fired makes 
the most sense, is the fairest, and ultimately will be the 
most efficient.”
However, one executive, Blair, speaks up and asks, 
“Shouldn’t we consider other factors, like diversity, when 
making these decisions? Relying only on position and ten￾ure might not result in the best decisions.” The other ex￾ecutives respond that downsizing is not about gender or 
race. Instead, it is about cutting off the least embedded 
parts of the organizational chart. Terminating a poorly 
performing manager who is essential to the culture and 
has worked for the company for over thirty years would 
be disastrous for morale. Moreover, terminating someone 
who plays a key leadership role would harm the coordina￾tion of our teams and business processes.
Blair points out that this method of laying off employ￾ees and managers could disproportionately affect mem￾bers of the organization from underrepresented groups. 
They are more likely to hold the positions that they are 
considering cutting. Only in recent years has Catron 
implemented a successful DEI initiative, resulting in the 
hiring of members from underrepresented groups. Blair 
says that they should develop another approach to carry 
out these layoffs that will not have potentially detrimental 
M15_ROBB0025_19_GE_C15.indd 544 13/12/22 3:10 AMFoundations of Organization Structure CHAPTER 15 545
consequences. Blair suggests adopting a more individual￾ized approach and using performance evaluations to as￾sess which individuals will need to be fired.
One executive chimes in, “You mean ‘rank and yank’? 
That never goes over well... And I thought that could 
also cause disparate impact toward our underrepresented 
groups?” Blair responds, “No, I do not mean we should 
rank all of the employees and managers based on perfor￾mance and cut everyone below a certain benchmark. I just 
think we need to think about their performance and con￾sider laying off those whose performance is having a detri￾mental effect on our organizational output and teamwork.”
Despite Blair earnestly trying to persuade the other ex￾ecutives, they ultimately decide that the original approach 
will be the least time-consuming.
Questions
15-9. Which approach do you believe is best? Explain.
15-10. Are there other strategies that organizations 
could employ to ensure that underrepresented 
employees and managers are not disproportion￾ately affected by the layoffs?
15-11. Besides layoffs, what other options might the ex￾ecutives have tried to reduce costs?191
CASE INCIDENT Kuuki: Reading the Atmosphere
Most Japanese businesses have very complex vertically 
structured organizations. Indeed, each of the key depart￾ments of an organization has its own vertical structure 
and operates rather like individual businesses. There is 
very little interrelationship between departments, each of 
which has very clearly defined roles.
When the business interacts with customers, it is the 
sales and marketing departments that handle negotia￾tions. Even when the customer needs technical informa￾tion and support, sales and marketing are often involved 
as an intermediary between the company’s engineers and 
the customer. It is common for sales specialists to take 
on the role of negotiators on behalf of the manufactur￾ing department or research and development. Inter￾departmental communications are infrequent.
One of the problems with this situation is that sales￾people rarely have technical expertise. The majority of 
salespeople would not have studied science and technol￾ogy and are more likely to be qualified in the arts; they are 
chosen for the sales role due to their social skills. The com￾mon perception is that engineers and technical specialists 
are not as sociable and are therefore not good sellers.
Japanese companies have relied on other ways to make 
up for this. In their offices, larger Japanese companies 
tend to have open-plan spaces. This allows the departmen￾tal head to learn what other people do and to ensure that 
they share information. In smaller Japanese businesses, it 
is common for the business owner to also be situated in an 
open-plan environment.
The key to success is “reading the air,” or reading the 
kuuki. Being alert to what is being said and what is being 
done means that Japanese managers have instant access 
to up-to-date information—they know what individual 
employees know. Individuals in a department are com￾fortable with this situation; informal information sharing 
is seen as an effective and vital process.192
Questions
15-12. Complex vertical organizational structures are 
very hierarchical in nature. They are very rigid, 
with each department having clearly defined 
roles. Is such an organization capable of being 
agile and responsive, or is it a disadvantage?
15-13. What are the problems with such strictly defined 
roles?
15-14. Is reading the air just eavesdropping and 
spying on others? Would most employees be 
comfortable with this situation?

 THE WOLF CULTURE 
The tech giant Huawei has rapidly expanded, bringing mobile phone 
and data service to areas worldwide. The company’s success is often 
attributed to its so-called “wolf culture.” Huawei’s culture is rooted in 
the background of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, who was an engineer in the 
People’s Liberation Army for nearly a decade. He founded the company 
in the late 1980s during the time of China’s capitalist revival. Since 
the company’s founding, military values, including drive, dedication, and 
persistence, have influenced the organization’s culture. The company 
speaks with pride about the early years of Huawei, during which employees 
endured tough working conditions to ensure the organization’s success. 
For instance, employees were given mattresses to take naps as they often 
worked late nights. 
 Huawei’s history continues to influence the culture today as employees 
still work long hours. New employees are also required to participate in 
a boot camp–style training course. Some employees have characterized 
this training course as “brainwashing.” New hires are directed to wear 
 red-and-white Huawei uniforms and take classes about the company’s 
history, products, and corporate culture. Although employees admit that 
working at Huawei is very difficult—some even describe it as “painful”—
they admit that without this type of culture, Huawei could not have 
achieved its success today. 
 Other Chinese companies like Alibaba and Xiaomi are known for 
having demanding hours. Yet Huawei seems to take it a step further. 
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 547 13/12/22 3:18 AM548 PART 4 The Organization System
Employees even sign a pledge of loyalty that states they willingly give up 
their vacation leave and overtime pay. Some may wonder how Huawei can 
retain employees long-term with this type of organizational culture. The 
company’s shareholding system appears to be key. Huawei is not a public 
company but instead is owned by employees. However, only those who 
perform well enough qualify to hold company shares. By sharing both the 
responsibilities and benefits, Huawei can maintain a strong collectivist 
culture. Employees are willing to make personal sacrifices if it benefits the 
organization.
However, the culture that was once celebrated as the key to Huawei’s 
success has now come under greater scrutiny. Evidence of widespread 
misconduct has surfaced. It appears that the “wolf culture” allowed or 
even encouraged employees to bend the rules to achieve success by 
whatever means, no matter how unethical. Workers have been accused 
of serious allegations from bribing government officials to do business 
in Africa to copying an American company’s source code. In 2015, the 
CEO revealed that thousands of employees had confessed to violations 
ranging from fraudulent reporting of financial information to bribery. 
While Huawei reports that all employees are required to study and sign 
guidelines regarding business conduct each year (including compliance 
with local laws and regulations), Zhengfei has admitted that many 
workers do not pay attention to the internal rules and controls. This lack 
of attention may be because Huawei staff are evaluated primarily based 
on how much business they contribute to the organization. Furthermore, 
the CEO has expressed that he believes ethical standards should 
be enforced so long as they do not interfere with the success of the 
organization’s business.
Huawei is now the world’s largest telecommunications equipment 
manufacturer and the second-largest producer of smartphones. 
However, its fate remains uncertain as Zhengfei’s daughter, Meng 
Wanzhou, the chief financial officer, was charged with fraud. The story 
of Huawei demonstrates the risks that come with an organizational 
culture that does not enforce ethical standards and neglects employee 
well-being.1
Organizations have values, beliefs, assumptions, and norms that govern how 
members behave. We call these expectations the organizational culture. 
Every organization has a culture that, depending on its strength, can have a 
considerable influence on the attitudes and behaviors of organization members, 
even if that effect is hard to measure precisely. In this chapter, we will discuss 
what organizational culture is, how it affects employee attitudes and behavior, 
where it comes from, and whether it can be changed.
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 548 13/12/22 3:18 AMOrganizational Culture and Change CHAPTER 16 549
What Is Organizational Culture?
Would you spend $10,000 on a guitar without even playing it? Customers of 
Chicago-based Reverb.com, an online musical instrument marketplace, are will￾ing to do so. Why do they keep coming back rather than going to competitors 
such as eBay? The answer may be found in its organizational culture. We have 
all felt an indescribable essence about the organizations we have experienced. 
This pervasive atmosphere can have a strong and measurable impact on behav￾ior. Reverb.com has created an organization and a brand, founded on a passion 
for music and a drive to create a wonderful customer experience for musicians. 
Employees and customers alike share values, beliefs, and traditions centered 
around music and its performance.2
As you will see in this chapter, organizational culture can have a profound 
effect on organizational effectiveness. Notably, 88  percent of millennials sur￾veyed by Gallup (a polling company) stated that they would remain in their 
jobs for more than five years if they were satisfied with the company’s purpose, or 
mission.3
And when culture becomes “toxic” it is very hard to change.4 It is not as 
easy as changing the organization’s executives either.5 For instance, many of 
Boeing’s CEOs are positioned to take on its cost-cutting culture but end up 
meeting the same fate as prior CEOs who have failed to realize the change.6
As Larry Light, CEO of Arcature, notes: “CEO changes without culture change 
do not produce the outcomes stakeholders would like. In fact, in many cases, 
changing management without changing the culture is tantamount to merely 
rearranging the deck chairs on a slowly sinking cruise ship.”7
A Definition of Organizational Culture
Organizational culture refers to a system of shared meaning held by members 
that distinguishes the organization from other organizations.8 This system of 
shared meaning includes values, beliefs, and assumptions that characterize the 
organization.9 These values, beliefs, and assumptions, when put into practice, 
(1) filter what employees pay attention to, (2) are physically manifested as mate￾rial symbols (for example, uniforms, statues, etc.) and stories, and (3) form the 
foundation for shared meaning among members of an organization.10
Organizational culture shows how employees perceive the essence of an orga￾nization, not whether they like them—that is, it is a descriptive term. Research on 
organizational culture has sought to measure how employees see their organiza￾tion: Does it encourage teamwork? Does it reward innovation? Does it stifle ini￾tiative? In contrast, job satisfaction is an evaluative term: It seeks to measure how 
employees feel about the organization’s expectations, reward practices, and the 
like. See Exhibit 16-1 for a contrast of two companies with very different organi￾zational cultures.
Organizational cultures are extremely difficult to define and character￾ize, and over the years many people sought to understand the meaning of 
culture in organizations.11 Many have asked, do organizations have cultures? 
These researchers have tried to figure out what makes cultures different from 
one another. Still others have asked, what are organization’s cultures? These 
researchers are more concerned with describing specific cultures and under￾standing what makes one particular organization tick. As an example, followers 
of the have perspective might try to figure out what values and beliefs descrip￾tively separate Reverb.com from, say, eBay. On the other hand, followers of the 
are perspective would only try to understand what Reverb.com is, for what it is: 
by studying the stories, rituals, material symbols, and language used at Reverb.
organizational culture A system of shared 
meaning held by an organization’s members 
that distinguishes the organization from 
others. This system is characterized by 
values, beliefs, and underlying assumptions.

com. These latter forms (described later in the next section) are notoriously 
hard to measure and interpret. Although sometimes observable by outsiders, 
they tap into deep underlying assumptions that are sometimes only capable of 
being fully grasped and experienced by an “insider.”12
Regardless of the many ways of conceptualizing varying “types” of culture by 
values or beliefs, one of the most common frameworks describes organizational 
cultures as possessing several competing values.13
1. “The Clan.” A culture based on human affiliation. Employees value attach￾ment, collaboration, trust, and support.
2. “The Adhocracy.” A culture based on change. Employees value growth, vari￾ety, attention to detail, stimulation, and autonomy.
3. “The Market.” A culture based on achievement. Employees value communi￾cation, competence, and competition.
4. “The Hierarchy.” A culture based on stability. Employees value communica￾tion, formalization, and routine.
The differences between these cultures are reflected in their internal ver￾sus external focus and their flexibility and stability.14 For instance, clans are 
internally focused and flexible, adhocracies are externally focused and flexible,

This organization is a manufacturing firm. Managers are expected to fully document all deci￾sions, and “good managers” are those who can provide detailed data to support their rec￾ommendations. Creative decisions that incur significant change or risk are not encouraged.
Because managers of failed projects are openly criticized and penalized, managers try not to
implement ideas that deviate much from the status quo. One lower-level manager quoted an
often-used phrase in the company: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
There are extensive rules and regulations in this firm that employees are required to fol￾low. Managers supervise employees closely to ensure there are no deviations. Management
is concerned with high productivity, regardless of the impact on employee morale or
turnover.
Work activities are designed around individuals. There are distinct departments and lines
of authority, and employees are expected to minimize formal contact with other employees
outside their functional area or line of command. Performance evaluations and rewards
emphasize individual effort, although seniority tends to be the primary factor in the deter￾mination of pay raises and promotions.
Organization B
This organization is also a manufacturing firm. Here, however, management encourages and
rewards risk taking and change. Decisions based on intuition are valued as much as those
that are well rationalized. Management prides itself on its history of experimenting with
new technologies and its success in regularly introducing innovative products. Managers or
employees who have a good idea are encouraged to “run with it.” And failures are treated
as “learning experiences.” The company prides itself on being market driven and rapidly
responsive to the changing needs of its customers.
There are few rules and regulations for employees to follow, and supervision is loose
because management believes that its employees are hardworking and trustworthy.
Management is concerned with high productivity but believes that this comes through 
treating its people right. The company is proud of its reputation as being a good place to work.
Job activities are designed around work teams, and team members are encouraged to
interact with people across functions and authority levels. Employees talk positively about
the competition between teams. Individuals and teams have goals, and bonuses are based
on achievement of these outcomes. Employees are given considerable autonomy in choosing
the means by which the goals are attained.

markets are externally focused and stable, and hierarchies are internally focused 
and stable. Reviews of hundreds of studies have helped summarize the findings 
on the cultures from the competing values framework.15 As shown in Exhibit 
16-2, the various cultures differ regarding how they influence organizational 
outcomes. Although we note that many of these outcomes are also heavily influ￾enced by leadership and organizational structure (see their respective chapters 
for more information), culture adds more to the picture than leadership or 
structure. A strategic approach to culture would suggest that cultures would 
ideally match one’s objectives.16 Although most cultures have a positive effect 
on employee attitudes, performance, innovation, product/service quality, and 
operational efficiency, it is clear that a clan or market culture is perhaps best 
aligned with customer-oriented outcomes and that a hierarchical culture is best 
for profitability and revenue growth.17
Although the competing values approach is one of the most frequently 
studied ways of examining organizational culture, other frameworks have been 
introduced. For example, the Organizational Culture Inventory groups cultures 
into three categories: (1) constructive cultures that value affiliation, encourage￾ment, and achievement; (2) passive-defensive cultures that avoid accountabil￾ity, seek validation and approval from others, and are conventional; and (3) 
aggressive-defensive cultures that are competitive, perfectionist, and power￾oriented.18 Another widely used framework is the Organizational Culture Profile
(OCP).19 The OCP draws upon a novel survey method in which employees sort 
a set of values based on how closely they represent their organization. The OCP 
suggests an organizational culture can be described by eight dimensions: (1) 
innovation, (2) attention to detail, (3) decisiveness, (4) team-orientation, (5) outcome￾orientation, (6) aggressiveness, (7) supportiveness, and (8) rewards-emphasis.
Do Organizations Have Uniform Cultures?
Organizational culture represents a perception that the organization’s mem￾bers hold in common. Statements about organizational culture are valid only if 
individuals with different backgrounds or at different levels in the organization 
describe the culture in similar terms.20
The dominant culture expresses the core values most members share and 
that give the organization its distinct personality.21 Subcultures tend to develop 
in large organizations in response to common problems or experiences that a 
group of members face in the same department or location.22 Most large orga￾nizations have a dominant culture and numerous subcultures.23 Sometimes the 
dominant culture A culture that expresses 
the core values that are shared by most of 
the organization’s members.
core values The primary or dominant 
values that are accepted throughout the 
organization.
subcultures Minicultures within an 
organization, typically defined by department 
designations or geographical separation.
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 551 13/12/22 3:18 AM552 PART 4 The Organization System
subcultures can be so strong, however, that they subtly reject the “official” cul￾ture and do not conform. 24 If organizations were composed only of subcultures, 
the dominant organizational culture would be significantly less powerful. It is 
the “shared meaning” aspect of culture (in both dominant and subcultures) 
that makes it a potent device for guiding and shaping behavior. Subcultures 
have even been detected at the country or nation level, forming because of 
immigration, assimilation of new immigrants, or class differences among the 
people. 25 
 Strong Versus Weak Cultures 
 It is possible to differentiate between strong and weak cultures. 26 If most 
employees have the same opinions about the organization’s mission and values, 
the culture is strong; if opinions vary widely, the culture is weak. 
 In a strong culture , the organization’s core values are both intensely held and 
widely shared. 27 The more members who accept the core values and the greater 
their commitment, the stronger the culture and the greater its influence on 
member behavior. David Rodriguez, executive vice president and chief human 
resources officer at Marriott hotels, emphasizes that it really is the people who 
forge a strong culture: “If you don’t have the courage and wisdom to release 
control of the culture to your associates and employees, it won’t work.” Instead, 
Marriott enlists the help of over 15,000 volunteer employees to champion the 
company’s culture. 28
 A strong culture should more directly affect organizational outcomes because 
it demonstrates high agreement about what the organization represents. Such 
unanimity of purpose builds cohesiveness, loyalty, meaning, and organizational 
 strong culture A culture in which the core 
values are intensely held and widely shared. 
 Myth or Science? An Organization’s Culture Is Forever 
 T
his statement is not true. 
Although organizational culture is 
difficult to change and a notable 
change can take a long time, it can 
be done. Sometimes it is essential 
for survival. For years, Wisconsin’s 
Wellspring system provided nursing 
homes where inpatients had little input 
about their care. The organizational 
culture allowed lax standards to pre￾vail. Then the network of eleven nurs￾ing homes launched a culture change 
initiative. Management focused on 
caregiver collaboration, education, 
accountability, and empowerment. The 
results were excellent: Wellspring real￾ized fewer state standards infractions 
and higher employee retention rates 
at the facilities. The results for the 
patients were even greater: fewer bed￾ridden residents, less use of restraints 
and psychoactive medication, less 
incontinence, and fewer tube feedings 
than in other nursing homes. 
 The Wellspring program illustrates 
the significant effect that positive orga￾nizational culture change can achieve. 
CEO Bob Flexon of Dynegy Inc., a 
Houston-based electric utility giant that 
emerged from bankruptcy, saved his 
company by changing the organizational 
culture. First, he ditched the cushy CEO 
office suite, $15,000 marble desk, and 
Oriental rugs for a small cubicle on a 
warehouse-style floor shared with all 
235 headquarters employees. Next, 
he visited company facilities, trained 
“culture champions,” reinstated annual 
performance reviews, and increased 
employee collaboration. He created 
a plaque as a reminder to “Be Here 
Now” instead of multitasking and 
banned smartphones from meetings. 
Flexon said, “The idea was to instill a 
winning spirit,” and he counts on his 
visibility as CEO to broadcast the cul￾ture change down to the lowest levels 
of the widespread organization. 
 Positive results at Dynegy have 
included a reduction in turnover from 
8  percent in 2011 to 5.8  percent in 
the turnaround of 2012. Flexon said, 
“People are cautiously beginning to 
believe that we can win again.” The 
company continued to report massive 
earnings losses, but Flexon is optimis￾tic about Dynegy’s rebound. He says, 
“Our ongoing focus on culture is what 
will make the difference.” Through sub￾stantial growth and multiple acquisi￾tions following its bankruptcy, Dynegy 
made around $5.5 billion in its last 
year of operation (2017) before being 
acquired by Vistra Energy in 2018. 29

commitment. These qualities, in turn, lessen employees’ propensity to leave. 
A study of nearly ninety thousand employees from 137 organizations found that 
culture strength or consistency was related to numerous financial outcomes when 
there was a strong sense of mission and high employee involvement. 30 A strong 
culture has enabled companies like Ace Hardware to thrive in an extremely com￾petitive market, a market in which many other companies have folded or declared 
bankruptcy.31
How Employees Learn Culture
Culture is transmitted in several forms, the most potent being stories, rituals, 
material symbols, and language.
Stories
When Henry Ford II was chair of Ford Motor Company, you would have been 
hard-pressed to find a manager who had not heard how he reminded his execu￾tives, when they got too arrogant, “It’s my name that’s on the building.” The 
message was clear: Henry Ford II ran the company. As another example, several 
senior Nike executives spend much of their time serving as corporate storytell￾ers.32 When they tell how cofounder (and Oregon track coach) Bill Bowerman 
went to his workshop and poured rubber into a waffle iron to create a better 
running shoe, they are talking about Nike’s spirit of innovation. The elderly 
man running in their first commercial in 1988 marks the first use of their slogan 
“just do it” and continues the story that anyone, despite their differences, can 
strive for and achieve their athletic goals.33
Stories such as these circulate through many organizations, anchoring the 
present in the past and legitimizing current practices.34 They typically include 
narratives about the organization’s founders, rule breaking, rags-to-riches 
successes, workforce reductions, relocations of employees, reactions to past 
mistakes, and organizational coping.35 Employees also create their own narra￾tives about how they came either to fit or not to fit with the organization during 
the process of socialization, including first days on the job, early interactions 
with others, and first impressions of organizational life.36 Evidence suggests that 
these emotionally charged, often inspirational stories are incredibly transfor￾mational, persuasive, and motivational37—driving employees to adopt and per￾petuate the culture.
Rituals
Rituals are repetitive sequences of activities that express and reinforce the key 
values of the organization—what goals are most important and/or which peo￾ple are important versus which are expendable.38 Some companies have non￾traditional rituals to help support the values of their cultures. Kimpton Hotels 
& Restaurants, one of Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For (for more 
than a decade), maintains its customer-oriented culture with traditions like a 
Housekeeping Olympics that includes blindfolded bedmaking and vacuum 
races.39 Some companies have also been using rituals to “convert” potential cus￾tomers, clients, and investors. For example, Ontario cool climate wineries have 
been using rituals in order to inspire and rouse emotional experiences among 
wine enthusiasts to identify with the winery and their product.40 Why do rituals 
work in reinforcing values and placating supervisors, employees, and customers 
alike? Recent research suggests that rituals work because they inspire a sense of 
control in their participants and, as a result, reduce anxiety.41

Symbols
The layout of corporate headquarters, the types of automobiles top executives 
are given, and the presence or absence of corporate aircraft are a few examples 
of material symbols, sometimes also known as artifacts.42 Others include the size 
of offices; the elegance of furnishings, perks, and attire; and even the organiza￾tion’s corporate social media page or website.43 These convey to employees who is 
important; the degree of egalitarianism top management desires; and the kinds of 
behavior that are appropriate, such as risk taking, and conservative, authoritarian, 
participative, individualistic, or social behavior. Material symbols also offer a sense 
of connection and stir emotions in employees who make sense of the symbols.44
At some firms, like Chicago clothing company Threadless, an “anything goes” 
atmosphere helps emphasize a creative culture. Threadless meetings are held in 
an Airstream camper parked inside the company’s converted FedEx warehouse, 
while employees in shorts and flip-flops work in bullpens featuring disco balls 
and garish decorations chosen by each team.45 As another example, the Palo Alto 
office of IDEO has a “play lab” littered with toys and knickknacks as well as an 
airplane wing sticking out of one of the walls in the building—both of which may 
symbolize IDEO’s playful experimentation and free expression values.46
Some cultures are known for the perks in their environments, such as 
Google’s bocce courts, software designer Autodesk’s bring-your-dog-to-work 
days, SAS’s solar panel field, Microsoft’s treehouse meeting spaces, and 
adventure-gear specialist REI’s free equipment rentals. Other companies com￾municate the values of their cultures through the gift of time to think creatively, 
either with leaders or offsite. For instance, Biotech leader Genentech and many 
other top companies provide paid sabbaticals. Genentech offers every employee 
six weeks’ paid leave for every six years of service to support a culture of equita￾bility and innovative thinking.47
Language
Many organizations and subunits within them use language to help members 
identify with the culture, attest to their acceptance of it, and help preserve 
it.48 Unique terms describe equipment, officers, key individuals, suppliers, 
material symbols Physical objects, or 
artifacts, that symbolize values, beliefs, or 
assumptions inherent in the organization’s 
culture.

Baidu, a Chinese Web services firm, 
describes its culture as 
“simple”—meaning direct, open, and 
uncomplicated—and “reliable”—
meaning trusting the competence 
of colleagues. Baidu’s casual work￾places reflect this trust with lounges, 
gyms, yoga studios, and dome￾shaped nap rooms employees may 
use at any time.

customers, or products related to the business. New employees may be over￾whelmed at first by acronyms and jargon that, once assimilated, act as a com￾mon denominator to unite members of a given culture or subculture. As an idea 
of how expansive the terminology used in the U.S. government, one librarian 
has created a comprehensive dictionary and guide ( GovSpeak) to non-military 
acronyms, abbreviations, and terms. 50
 Despite providing a unique, descriptive window into the culture of organi￾zations, values and beliefs can be conveyed through language. For example, in 
one study of Fortune 500 mission statements, organizations that communicated 
they believe people can grow and improve tended to have more positive culture 
ratings on Glassdoor than companies that believe people do not change. In 
subsequent studies of employees at Fortune 1000 companies, this perception of 
culture impacted employee trust and commitment. 51
 However, many have started to view language and jargon as impediments to 
organizational effectiveness, despite their benefits of culturally binding people 
together. Instead of using “plain language,” organizations that use jargon and 
acronyms actually create situations that lead to confusion and inefficiency. 52
Worse yet, language, jargon, and acronym usage can create a veil employees and 
leaders can use to portray unethical behavior in a positive light. For instance, 
one leaked message from luggage company Away’s CEO portrayed cutting 
employee PTO and flexible work arrangements in a positive light as an opportu￾nity: “I know this group is hungry for career development opportunities, and in 
 An Ethical Choice 
 A Culture of Compassion 
I
 n the world of banking, success 
and ethical culture do not neces￾sarily go hand in hand. Leaders 
who desire ethical cultures in their 
organizations must choose to build 
ethics into the company’s definition 
of success in ways that translate 
into ethical actions for managers and 
employees. Contrast two financial suc￾cess stories, Goldman Sachs and JP 
Morgan Chase & Company. Both mega￾banks are among the Fortune 100 (the 
largest U.S. companies ranked by rev￾enue). They are also two of Fortune ’s 
World’s Most Admired Companies. 
This list ranks the largest companies 
in revenue by nine criteria, including 
social responsibility. Yet their organi￾zational cultures appear to be vastly 
different. Goldman Sachs seems to 
struggle to achieve an ethical cul￾ture for its employees and clients. In 
contrast, JPMorgan Chase seems to 
emanate a culture of compassion. 
Consider some headlines: 
• Goldman Sachs Agrees to Pay More 
Than $2.9 Billion to Resolve Probes 
Into Its 1MDB Scandal. “Goldman 
Sachs today accepted responsi￾bility for its role in a conspiracy 
to bribe high-ranking foreign offi￾cials to obtain lucrative underwrit￾ing and other business relating to 
1MDB,” attorney general Brian C. 
Rabbit stated. A pair of employ￾ees at the company helped a cor￾rupt Malaysian financier funnel 
billions of dollars from a devel￾opment fund that was supposed 
to build the country’s economy. 
Instead, the money funded a 
multimillion-dollar yacht, multiple 
luxury properties worldwide, and a 
stake in the Scorsese film The Wolf 
of Wall Street . 
• JPMorgan Chase to Spend $30 Bil￾lion to Close the Racial Wealth Gap. 
 “Systemic racism is a tragic part of 
America’s history. We can do more 
and do better to break down sys￾tems that have propagated racism 
and widespread economic inequal￾ity, especially for Black and Latinx 
people. It’s long past time that soci￾ety addresses racial inequities in a 
more tangible, meaningful way.” The 
money JPMorgan Chase is commit￾ting to the initiative will go toward 
many different aims, such as financ￾ing forty thousand mortgages total￾ing $8 billion, committing $4 billion 
to help twenty thousand Black and 
Latinx homeowners refinance their 
homes, and $2 billion worth of 
assistance to Black and Latinx￾owned businesses. 
 Organizational culture is where lead￾ers’ ethical choices demonstrate their 
expectations for others’ decisions 
throughout the company. These exam￾ples suggest that the two cultures may 
subtly encourage ethical and unethical 
behavior in different ways. 49

thoughtfulness I’ve put into creating this career development opportunity and 
that you’re all excited to operate consistently with our core values to solve this 
problem and pave the way for the customer experience ... being best-in-class 
when it comes to being Customer Obsessed. Thank you!”53
Moreover the type of language used in organizations can influence workplace 
discrimination. For instance, mission statements that emphasized thoughtful 
consideration predicted whether the company was involved in EEOC discrimi￾nation suits.54 Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, employees and lead￾ers in organizations that used stigmatizing labels for the virus were more likely 
to create negative, discriminatory experiences for Asian American employees.55
Clearly, language is descriptively a window into organizations’ culture, yet it can 
be a double-edged sword with its own pros and cons.
Creating and Sustaining Culture
An organization’s culture does not pop out of thin air and once established, it is 
very resistant to change. What influences the creation of a culture? What rein￾forces and sustains it once in place?
How a Culture Begins
An organization’s customs, traditions, and general way of doing things are 
largely due to what it has done before and how successful it was in doing it. 
This leads us to the ultimate source of an organization’s culture: the founders.56
Founders have a vision of what the organization should be, and the firm’s initial 
small size makes it easy to enact that vision with all members.
Culture creation occurs in three ways.57 First, founders tend to hire and 
retain employees who think and feel the same way they do. Second, they social￾ize employees to their way of thinking and feeling. And finally, the behavior 
of the founder(s) encourages employees to identify with them and internal￾ize their beliefs, values, and assumptions. When the organization succeeds, the 
founders’ personalities become embedded in the culture. In fact, the founder is 
so important to the organization’s success that one study of over two thousand 
firms found that the founding top management team made little to no differ￾ence in the firms performance later on in its life, whereas the CEO made all the 
difference.58 The influence of the founder is so strong, that the cultural founda￾tions established by the founder even transmit to organizational spinoffs and splits
that break off from the parent organization as completely new organizations 
(see the discussion in the chapter on organizational structure).59
For example, the fierce, competitive style and disciplined, authoritarian 
nature of Hyundai, the giant Korean conglomerate, exhibited the same char￾acteristics often used to describe founder Chung Ju-Yung.60 Only gradually 
has the company started to shed the disciplined, competitive nature it was so 
entrenched in. As leadership ceded to Chung Mong-koo, and his son, Chung 
Eui-sun, subtle signs of culture change have been apparent. For instance, Frank 
Ahrens stepped into the Hyundai office and noticed a major change in the five 
years since he had been there. He asked his friends at Hyundai: “Where are all 
the ties?” They responded that the business casual attire was a symbol of the 
changing culture and new leadership.61 Other founders with sustaining impact 
on their organization’s culture include Bill Gates at Microsoft, Ingvar Kamprad

at IKEA, Herb Kelleher at Southwest Airlines, Fred Smith at FedEx, and Richard 
Branson at the Virgin Group.
Exhibit 16-3 summarizes how an organization’s culture is established and 
sustained. The original culture derives from the founder’s philosophy and 
strongly influences hiring criteria as the firm grows.62 The success of socializa￾tion depends on the deliberateness of matching new employees’ values to those 
of the organization in the selection process and on top management’s commit￾ment to socialization programs. Top managers’ actions set the general climate, 
including what is acceptable behavior and what is not, and employees sustain 
and perpetuate the culture.63 The culture then becomes linked and entrenched 
within the organizational structures and systems and is perpetuated by leader￾ship. In the most comprehensive study of organizational culture to date (an 
impressive study of more than 500,000 employees from over 26,000 organiza￾tions), culture was found strongly related to the current leadership, practices, 
and structures that comprise the organization.64
Keeping a Culture Alive
Once a culture is in place, practices within the organization maintain it by giv￾ing employees a set of similar experiences.65 The selection process, perfor￾mance evaluation criteria, training and development activities, and promotion 
procedures (all discussed in the next chapter on HR policies and practices) 
ensure those hired fit in with the culture, reward those employees who support 
it, and penalize (or even terminate) those who challenge it.66 Three forces play 
a particularly important part in sustaining a culture: selection or hiring prac￾tices, actions of top management, and socialization methods (e.g., onboarding, 
training, and including new employees). Let us look at each.
Selection The explicit goal of the selection process is to identify and hire indi￾viduals with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform successfully. The final 
decision, because it is significantly influenced by the decision maker’s judgment 
of how well candidates fit into the organization, identifies people whose values 
are consistent with at least a good portion of the organization’s.67 The selec￾tion process also provides information to applicants. Those who perceive a con￾flict between their values and those of the organization can remove themselves 
from the applicant pool or even fake their way into the organization by feigning 
that they share the organization’s values.68 Selection thus becomes a two-way 
street, with both employers and applicants as active participants in determin￾ing the value fit between the applicant and the organization. For example, in 
W. L. Gore & Associate’s selection process, teams put job applicants through 
extensive interviews to ensure that they can deal with the level of uncertainty, 
flexibility, and teamwork standard in Gore plants. Not surprisingly, W. L. Gore

appears regularly on Fortune’s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For (number 
eighty-three in 2020) partially because of its selection process emphasis on cul￾ture fit.69
Top Management The actions of top management have a major impact on the 
organization’s culture.70 Through words and behavior, senior executives estab￾lish norms that filter through the organization about, for instance, whether risk 
taking is desirable, how much freedom managers give employees, the uniforms 
employees should wear, and what behavior is desired and rewarded. Research 
on hundreds of CEOs and top management team (TMT) members suggests 
that more positive organizational outcomes are achieved when the culture and 
leadership styles are complementary in content and not redundant.71 When leader￾ship behaviors and an organization’s cultural values are redundant, the leaders 
have less of an effect on organizational outcomes. However, when leaders pro￾vide something that is lacking in the organization’s culture, they can substitute 
or fill in for the element that is missing. In other words, one can fill in where the 
other fails. For example, a transformational leader in a bureaucratic, hierarchi￾cal culture would be more effective than a transactional leader in the same type 
of culture.
The culture of supermarket chain Wegmans—which believes driven, 
happy, and loyal employees are more eager to help one another and provide 
exemplary customer service—is a direct result of the beliefs of the Wegman 
family. Their focus on fine foods separates Wegmans from other grocers—
a focus maintained by the company’s employees, many of whom are hired 
based on their interest in food. Top management at the company believes in 
taking care of employees to enhance satisfaction and loyalty. For example, 
Wegmans has paid more than $120 million in educational scholarships for 
more than 38,500 employees since 1984. Top management also supports 
above-average pay for employees and regularly appears on Fortune’s 100 
Best Companies to Work For list (ranked third in 2020), in large measure 
because top management sustains the positive organizational culture begun 
by its founding members.72
Socialization No matter how good a job the organization does in recruitment 
and selection, new employees need help adapting to the prevailing culture. This 
help comes in the form of socialization.73 Socialization can help alleviate the 
problem many employees report when their new jobs are different from what 
they expected and can make or break how employees see their jobs moving 
forward (see OB Poll). For example, Essar Oil & Gas, an Indian petroleum pro￾duction, refinement, and marketing company, has gamified its entire onboard￾ing process. With the help of Indusgeeks, a game-based training firm, Essar has 
its new employees move through a 3D game on their first days that takes them 
through the work environment, lets them meet with various personnel (getting 
a sense for who is who in the office), and learn what they need before working.74
Netflix, Quora, Twitter, and other companies are adopting fresh onboarding 
(new hire acclimation) procedures, including assigning “peer coaches,” hold￾ing socializing events, and personalizing orientation programs. “When we can 
stress the personal identity of people, and let them bring more of themselves at 
work, they are more satisfied with their job and have better results,” researcher 
Francesca Gino of Harvard said.75
We can think of socialization as a process with three stages: prearrival, 
encounter, and metamorphosis.76 This process, shown in Exhibit 16-4, has an 
impact on the new employee’s productivity, commitment to the organization, 
and decision to stay with the organization.
socialization A process which enables new 
employees to acquire the social knowledge 
and necessary skills in order to adapt to the 
organization’s culture.

1. Prearrival stage. The prearrival stage recognizes that everyone arrives with a 
set of values, attitudes, and expectations about both the work and the orga￾nization. One major purpose of a business school, for example, is to social￾ize students to the attitudes and behaviors companies desire in employees. 
Newcomers to high-profile organizations with strong market positions have 
their own assumptions about what it is like to work there. 77 Most new re￾cruits will expect Nike to be dynamic and exciting and Merrill Lynch to be 
high in pressure and rewards. How accurately people judge an organiza￾tion’s culture before they join the organization and how positive, adaptive, 
and proactive their personalities are become critical predictors of how well 
they adjust. 78
2. Encounter stage. The selection process can help inform prospective em￾ployees about the organization. Upon entry into the organization, the

new member enters the encounter stage and confronts the possibility that 
expectations—about the job, coworkers, boss, and organization in 
general—may differ from reality.79 If expectations were accurate, this stage 
merely cements earlier perceptions. However, this is not often the case. At 
the extreme, a new member may become disillusioned enough to resign. 
Proper recruitment, selection, and socialization (e.g., giving a realistic pre￾view of the job) should significantly reduce this outcome, along with en￾couraging friendship ties in the organization—newcomers are more com￾mitted when friendly coworkers help them “learn the ropes.”80 For better or 
worse, learning, unlearning, and relationship building are key during this 
stage:81 If newcomers are not proactive enough in learning about the orga￾nization and helping out where they can, if supervisors and coworkers do 
not do their due diligence in socializing the newcomer and fulfilling prom￾ises made during recruitment, or if the exchange between the newcomer 
and the employees is not good, newcomers may become disillusioned.82
However, it is also possible for undesirable behaviors that may be an aspect 
of the organization’s culture such as counterproductive work behaviors 
(CWBs) to be transmitted to employees during the encounter stage. For 
example, one study of manufacturing sales departments in southern China 
found employees may model undesirable behaviors, such as heavy drinking 
with clients, that may result in increased work–family conflict and turnover 
risk over time.83
3. Metamorphosis stage. Finally, to work out any problems discovered dur￾ing the encounter stage, the new member changes or goes through the 
metamorphosis stage.
84 The options presented in Exhibit 16-5 are alterna￾tives designed to bring about metamorphosis. Most research suggests two 
major “bundles” of socialization practices.85 The more management relies on 
formal, collective, fixed, and serial socialization programs while emphasizing

metamorphosis stage The stage in 
the socialization process in which a new 
employee changes and adjusts to the job, 
work group, and organization.
Exhibit 16-5 Socialization Practices
Formal vs. Informal The more a new employee is segregated from the ongoing work setting
and differentiated in some way to make explicit their newcomer’s role, the more socialization
is formal. Specific orientation and training programs are examples. Informal socialization puts
the new employee directly into the job, with little or no special attention. 
Individual vs. Collective New members can be socialized individually. This describes how it is
done in many professional offices. They can also be grouped together and processed
through an identical set of experiences, as in military boot camp.
Fixed vs. Variable This refers to the time schedule in which newcomers make the transition
from outsider to insider. A fixed schedule establishes standardized stages of transition. This
characterizes rotational training programs. It also includes probationary periods, such as the
8- to 10-year “associate” status used by accounting and law firms before deciding on
whether or not a candidate is made a partner. Variable schedules give no advance notice of
their transition timetable. Variable schedules describe the typical promotion system, in which
one is not advanced to the next stage until one is “ready.”
Serial vs. Random Serial socialization is characterized by the use of role models who train
and encourage the newcomer. Apprenticeship and mentoring programs are examples. In
random socialization, role models are deliberately withheld. New employees are left on their
own to figure things out.
Investiture vs. Divestiture Investiture socialization assumes that the newcomer’s qualities 
and qualifications are the necessary ingredients for job success, so these qualities and
qualifications are confirmed and supported. Divestiture socialization tries to strip away
certain characteristics of the recruit. Fraternity and sorority “pledges” go through 
divestiture socialization to shape them into the proper role. 
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 560 13/12/22 3:18 AMOrganizational Culture and Change CHAPTER 16 561
divestiture, the more likely newcomers’ differences will be stripped away and 
replaced by standardized predictable behaviors. These institutional practices 
are common in police departments, fire departments, and other organiza￾tions that value rule following and order. Programs that are informal, indi￾vidual, variable, and random while emphasizing investiture are more likely to 
give newcomers a sense of their roles and methods of working. Creative fields 
such as research and development, advertising, and filmmaking rely on these 
individual practices.86 Most research suggests that high levels of institutional 
practices encourage person–organization fit, high levels of commitment, and 
improved role clarity, whereas individual practices produce more role innova￾tion, improve motivation, and lead to social integration.87
The three-part entry socialization process is complete when new members 
have internalized and accepted the norms of the organization and their work 
groups, are confident in their competence, and feel trusted and valued by their 
peers. They understand the system—not only their own tasks but the rules, pro￾cedures, and informally accepted practices as well. Finally, they know what is 
expected of them and what criteria will be used to measure and evaluate their 
work. As Exhibit 16-4 showed earlier, successful metamorphosis should have a 
positive impact on new employees’ productivity and their commitment to the 
organization and reduce their propensity to leave the organization (turnover).
Researchers examine how employee attitudes change during socialization by 
measuring at several points over the first few months. Several studies have now 
documented patterns of “honeymoons” and “hangovers” for new workers, show￾ing that the period of initial adjustment is often marked by decreases in job sat￾isfaction as idealized hopes come into contact with the reality of organizational 
life.88 Newcomers may find that the level of social support they receive from super￾visors and coworkers is gradually withdrawn over the first few weeks on the job, 
as everyone returns to “business as usual.”89 Role conflict and role overload may 
rise for newcomers over time, and workers with the largest increases in these role 
problems experience the largest decreases in commitment and satisfaction.90 The 
initial adjustment period for newcomers may present increasing demands and 
difficulties, especially for people who are energized by interpersonal interactions 
(e.g., extroverts), at least in the short term.91 What can supervisors and coworkers 
do to address “hangovers”? Research suggests that “too many” socialization prac￾tices can make things worse, but providing a great deal of social support helps 
newcomers deal with their increasing demands and decreasing attitudes.92
What Do Cultures Do?
Let us discuss the role that culture performs and whether it can ever be a liabil￾ity for an organization.
The Functions of Culture
Culture defines “the rules of the game.” First, it has a boundary-defining role: 
It creates distinctions between organizations. Second, it conveys a sense of iden￾tity for organization members. Third, culture facilitates commitment to some￾thing larger than individual self-interest. Fourth, it enhances the stability of 
the social system. Culture is the social glue that helps hold the organization 
together by providing standards for what employees should say and do. Finally, 
it is a sense-making and control mechanism that guides and shapes employ￾ees’ attitudes and behavior. This last function is of interest to us in the study of 
organizational behavior (OB).93 Organizational culture predicts the strategies

and dysfunctional effects

organization.
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 561 13/12/22 3:18 AM562 PART 4 The Organization System
organizations adopt, the structure the organization assumes, the types of leader￾ship styles used by leaders, and the practices adopted by the organization.94
A strong culture supported by formal rules and regulations (i.e., an organiza￾tional infrastructure) ensures that employees will act in a relatively uniform and 
predictable way. For example, research has shown that a positive organizational 
culture improves employee job attitudes and, as such, bolsters talent attraction 
and retention.95 As another example, a study of the top 100 Taiwanese financial 
enterprises in 2005 demonstrated that those companies that valued innovation 
as a component of their culture were able to learn more and more quickly in 
order to drive innovation.96
Today’s trend toward decentralized organizations (see the chapter on orga￾nizational structure) makes culture more important than ever, but ironically it 
also makes establishing a strong culture more difficult. When formal author￾ity and control systems are reduced through decentralization, different forces 
of influence can pull culture in various, non-uniform directions. For instance, 
employees organized in teams may show greater allegiance to their team and its 
values than to the organization. Individual–organization “fit”—that is, whether 
the applicant’s or employee’s attitudes and behavior are compatible with the 
culture—strongly influences who gets a job offer, a favorable performance 
review, or a promotion.97 It is no coincidence that Disney theme park employees 
appear almost universally wholesome and smile brightly. The company selects 
employees who will maintain that image.
Culture Creates Climate
Organizational climate refers to the shared perceptions that organizational 
members have about their organization and work environment.98 These percep￾tions are directed at the policies, practices, and procedures experienced by the 
employees. Although it may appear difficult on the surface to distinguish orga￾nizational culture from climate, culture and climate are “two crucial building 
blocks for organizational description.”99 One meta-analysis found that, across 
dozens of different studies, positive climates were strongly related to individuals’ 
level of job satisfaction, involvement, commitment, and motivation.100 A posi￾tive workplace climate has been linked to higher customer satisfaction and orga￾nizational financial performance as well.101
In our discussion of culture so far, we have referred to culture as something 
that is difficult to measure somewhat esoteric. For instance, an employee of an 
organization for many years may have a much better understanding of an orga￾nization’s culture than someone who just found out about the organization. 
Today, researchers agree that organizational climate represents the more read￾ily observable “behavioral evidence” for an organization’s culture.102 It directly 
links what the organization values and believes with explicit practices, policies, 
and procedures. In other words, it puts the “what we believe and value” (like 
what you would find in a mission statement) and links it to what employees 
perceive is actually supported, rewarded, and practiced. If an organization is like 
an onion, the culture is at the core, and the climates are on the surface layers.
Culture creates climate. What members value, believe, and assume will ulti￾mately affect the policies, practices, and procedures the organization puts into 
place. As an example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, you may have heard a 
manager in a commercial for your favorite local chain restaurant say something 
like “The health and safety of our employees and customers is our number one 
priority.” What does this tell you about the company? Well, it probably tells you 
that they value safety, and it is something that they believe is imperative to pur￾sue; in other words, that the organization has a “safety culture.” With a safety 
culture in place, you are much more likely to see the local restaurants of this 
organizational climate The shared 
perceptions that organizational members 
have about their organization and work 
environment; particularly, the policies, 
practices, and procedures that are in place.

chain taking cleanliness seriously by periodically wiping down high-touch areas, 
requiring mask compliance, and following social distancing precautions.
Dozens of dimensions of culture and climate have been studied—not just 
safety. Some of the commonly examined culture and climate dimensions 
include innovation, creativity, communication, warmth and support, involve￾ment, justice, diversity, and customer service.103 These dimensions have their 
own unique implications for OB, although many of them overlap (e.g., positive 
climates tend to co-occur with other positive climates).104 For example, some￾one who encounters a safety climate will have higher levels of job satisfaction 
and organizational commitment, have better health, and be more prone to 
engage in safety behaviors.105 Climate influences the habits that people adopt. 
If there is a climate of safety, everyone wears safety gear and follows safety proce￾dures even if individually they would not normally think very often about being 
safe. Indeed, many studies have shown that a safety climate decreases the num￾ber of documented injuries on the job.106 Climates can also interact with one 
another to produce various outcomes. For example, a climate of worker empow￾erment can lead to higher levels of performance in organizations that also have 
a climate of personal accountability.107 They can also clash—organizations that 
simultaneously encourage caution and risk-taking can lead to dissonant feelings 
such as less commitment toward the organizations.108
Putting Culture Into Practice as Climate Although we often expect culture to 
manifest in a predictable way, there may be a difference between espoused (i.e., 
adopted on-the-surface) and enacted (i.e., actually put into practice) cultural 
values, beliefs, and assumptions. This difference has implications for how 
climate emerges.109 In making sense of their environments, employees draw 
a distinction between what they “hear” or “see” being supported by organi￾zational leaders in meetings, memos, rule books, and so on, and what they 
“actually” see being enacted. Climate, then, is a function of what employees 
perceive as being rewarded. When there is alignment between the context, 
culture, and climate, climates are more likely to be enacted and lead to posi￾tive outcomes.110
Returning to our COVID-19 example, did the organization you saw on 
television ever do anything about it? Let us say you went to one of these res￾taurant locations closest to you, and you were appalled to find absolutely 
none of the employees wearing masks, no one wiping down high-touch sur￾face areas, and customers packed into tables with no regard for social dis￾tancing. You could say that this location had a poor “safety climate.” But 
then, at your friend’s urging, you tried a different location on the other side 
of town. You were shocked to see it was like night and day. They were at lim￾ited capacity, customers were spread out across the restaurant, all employees 
and customers were directed to wear masks, and you could see employees 
diligently cleaning high-touch surface areas. In other words, this location 
had a strong safety climate. This example illustrates that just as there can be 
subcultures that form in organizations, so too can different climates emerge 
in an organization.
Exhibit 16-6 depicts the impact of organizational culture. Employees form 
an overall subjective perception of the organization based on leader and mem￾ber behaviors, the organizational structure, and the organization’s values and 
beliefs as well as artifacts, stories, and symbols. This overall perception repre￾sents, in effect, the organization’s culture, which varies in its strength (or degree 
to which others perceive the culture in the same way). The culture is then 
revealed through organizational climates, which manifest culture’s underlying 
values and beliefs. The climates then affect employee performance and satisfac￾tion, along with other outcomes relevant to organization.
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 563 13/12/22 3:18 AM564 PART 4 The Organization System
Culture as an Asset
Cultures can contribute significantly to an organization’s bottom line in many 
ways. Companies like Google, Adobe, and Samsung have recently been ranked 
as some of the best organizations to work for given their excellent cultures. For 
instance, one employee wrote about Adobe that the organization “genuinely 
cares about their employees and seek to have a positive impact on the world,” 
highlighting its focus on ethics and sustainability.111 In the following sections, 
we describe several cultures (and their corresponding climates) that affect atti￾tudes and behavior in organizations.
Ethical Cultures and Climates Organizational cultures are not neutral in their 
ethical orientation, even when they are not openly pursuing ethical goals. 
Ethical culture develops over time as the shared concept of right and wrong 
behavior in the workplace. Ethical culture reflects the true values of the organi￾zation and shapes the ethical decision making of its members.112 Ethical cultures 
espouse clear ethical standards, with ethical behavior modeled by leadership.113
Employees and managers in ethical cultures are open to discuss moral issues 
and are reinforced for their ethical behavior.114 Ethical cultures also reduce 
employee burnout and bolster engagement in both managers and employees.115
Ethical climates are heavily influenced by the values and beliefs leaders hold 
about ethical behavior as well as the collective sense of identity people forge around 
their shared ethics.116 An organization’s ethical climate is a powerful influence on 
the way its individual members feel they should behave.117 Ethical climates that 
emphasize self-interest are negatively associated with employee job satisfaction and 
organizational commitment, even though those climates appeal to helping oneself 
versus others. These climates are also positively associated with turnover intentions, 
workplace bullying, and deviant behavior.118 Ethical climates that emphasize caring 
for one another and establishing rules may bring greater job satisfaction as well as 
reduce employee turnover intentions, workplace bullying, and dysfunctional behav￾ior. Recent research also suggests that ethical climates have a strong influence on 
sales growth over time when there is also a customer service climate to support it.119
Sustainable Cultures and Climates Sustainability refers to maintaining practices 
over very long periods of time because the tools or structures that support the 
practices are not damaged by the processes.120 Jeffrey Hollender created an orga￾nization that literally embodies the concept of sustainability: Seventh Generation. 
Founded in 1988, the company’s name is based on an Iroquois proverb: “In our 
every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven 
generations.”121 The name serves as a symbol reflecting the value of sustainability 
to Seventh Generation. When we engage in business practices (e.g., enacting a 
ethical culture The shared concept of right 
and wrong behavior in the workplace that 
reflects the true values of the organization 
and shapes the ethical decision making of 
its members.

a long period of time because the tools 
or structures that support them are not 
damaged by the processes.

sustainability climate), we do so sustainably when we ensure that our practices 
can be continued and that we use resources responsibly, minimizing waste, maxi￾mizing reusability, and ensuring continued efficiency. Social sustainability practices 
address the ways social systems are affected by an organization’s actions over time 
and, in turn, how changing social systems may affect the organization. Here, orga￾nizations should consider the effect of their labor practices on people over time, 
such as how job design (e.g., working hours) affects stress and health, how layoff 
policies and health insurance affect employees’ well-being, and so on.122
A substantial majority of executives view sustainability as an important part of 
future success.123 Indeed, research has demonstrated that sustainability practices 
can affect organizations’ reputation, productivity, talent acquisition, retention, 
engagement, cost efficiency, innovation, and financial performance.124 Concepts 
of sustainable management have their origins in the environmental movement, 
so processes that are in harmony with the natural environment are encouraged. 
For example, farmers in Australia have been working collectively to increase water 
use efficiency, minimize soil erosion, and implement tilling and harvesting meth￾ods that ensure long-term viability for their farm businesses.125 In a very different 
context, Siemens has a comprehensive sustainability strategy that uses the United 
Nations’ sustainable development goals as a guideline, focusing on improving 
peoples’ health and well-being, taking action for clean energy and climate, and 
furthering education, peace, and justice across the globe.126 With such a compre￾hensive focus on sustainability, it is no wonder that Siemens was ranked in the Top 
10 Most Sustainable companies in the world in 2020, according to Forbes.
127
To create a truly sustainable business, an organization must develop a long-term 
culture and put its values into practice through climate.128 In other words, there 
needs to be a sustainable system for creating sustainability! In one workplace study, 
a company seeking to reduce energy consumption found that soliciting group feed￾back reduced energy use significantly more than simply issuing reading materials 
about the importance of conservation.129 In other words, talking about energy con￾servation and building the value into the organizational culture resulted in positive 
employee behavioral changes. The leader plays a large role, too: Leaders engage in 
several behaviors to help build a sustainable culture, and some of them do so from 
formal positions (e.g., chief sustainability officer).130 Like other cultural practices 
we have discussed, sustainability needs time and nurturing to grow.
Innovative Cultures and Climates The most innovative companies are 
often characterized by their open, unconventional, collaborative, vision￾ary, and accelerating cultures.132 Startup firms often have innovative 
cultures because they are usually small, agile, and focused on solving prob￾lems to survive and grow. Consider ad agency Droga5, recently bought by 
Accenture. As a startup, Droga5 sought to “redefine advertising, making it 
viral and into a union of marketing and entertainment instead of a ‘disrup￾tion model of uninvited guests’” (e.g., intrusive or annoying commercials, 
ad spots, etc.).133 Both Accenture and Droga5 have been listed on most 
innovative company lists, so the fit seemed to be a good one.134 Because 
of the similar organizational cultures, the two may be able to continue 
their startup level of innovation. Research on companies such as these has 
found that innovation-friendly practices (support for new ideas, openness 
to change, and providing resources to be creative) leads to boosts in creativ￾ity at work, the creation and implementation of novel ideas, and increased 
performance.135
At the other end of the startup spectrum, consider Netflix. It went from 
a traditional mail-order DVD service to video-on-demand, even when it was 
the leader in its already large business. Netflix embodies, as Gary Pisano 
(professor at Harvard) notes, the “no, it doesn’t have to be that way” culture. 
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 565 13/12/22 3:18 AM566 PART 4 The Organization System
When others were predicting their downfall when trying to innovate while 
they already “had a good thing going,” they succeeded. 136 Innovation can 
also come from subcultures. For example, during the 2013–2018 period, 
 Toward a Better World 
 Morgan Stanley: Sustainable and Ethical 
Organizational Cultures Influence Investment 
Decisions 
 Decades ago, it used to be that the 
only factors that mattered included a 
company’s tangible assets. Inventory, 
production, supply chains, revenue, 
leverage, and profit were what mattered 
at the end of the day. The times have 
changed. Nowadays, intangible assets 
(e.g., culture, people) comprise an esti￾mated 52 percent of any given compa￾ny’s market value (and for some, it can 
be as high as 90  percent). Moreover, 
investors allocated over three times as 
many assets into socially responsible 
firms in 2020 as in 2019 and twenty￾five times as many assets than in 
2015. In fact, projections suggest that 
it will become a trillion-dollar business 
by 2030. Several investing firms like 
Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Vanguard, 
and State Street are keenly aware of 
these facts. They have adjusted their 
strategy and focus to include culture as 
a key element of investing decisions. 
 Some organizations are dedicating 
entire R&D units to sustainable invest￾ment, like Morgan Stanley’s Institute 
for Sustainable Investing. The insti￾tute is dedicated to mobilizing capital 
for sustainable firms, first and fore￾most. But the institute also works 
with academic institutions, universi￾ties, and colleges to conduct research 
and attain insights on environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) invest￾ing best practices. The institute has its 
own culture with a clear mission set by 
James P. Gorman, the chair and CEO of 
Morgan Stanley: “It is abundantly clear 
that the solutions to global challenges 
can only achieve the required scale if 
they can attract a critical mass of pri￾vate capital. To this end, we’ve estab￾lished the Morgan Stanley Institute 
for Sustainable Investing to lead work 
across our firm, with our client, and with 
academic institutions to help mobilize 
capital to sustainable enterprises, via 
global markets and the investors who 
drive them.” 
 How does Morgan Stanley advance 
the study of sustainable investing? 
Each year, in partnership with the 
Kellogg School of Management at 
Northwestern University, the insti￾tute hosts a Sustainable Investing 
Challenge, recruiting hundreds of grad￾uate students worldwide to develop and 
pitch sustainable investing approaches 
for addressing ESG challenges. For 
instance, the 2021 grand prize winners 
were BeeBank & Brokerage—pitched 
by University of Oxford students to 
serve as a financial resource for bee 
farmers to stave off the extinction of 
honeybees. The competition has been 
held on an annual basis since 2011 
and has resulted in many successful 
ventures. 
 However, many are skeptical 
of “ESG investing.” Sony Kapoor 
(Managing Director of the Nordic 
Institute for Finance, Technology, and 
Sustainability), for instance, says that 
the truth “is only whispered in the cor￾ridors of finance—most ESG invest￾ing is a ruse to launder reputations, 
maximize fees, and assuage guilt.” 
Furthermore, Tariq Fancy (BlackRock’s 
former chief investment officer) 
remarked that “advancing real change 
in the environment doesn’t yield the 
same return . . . No matter what they 
tout as green investing, portfolio man￾agers are legally bound [to] do nothing 
that compromises profits.” 
 Despite these criticisms, research 
suggests that these opinions may 
actually be myths not based on fact. 
Moreover, analyses of the returns on 
socially responsible and sustainable 
investments suggest that they perform 
just as well as or even better than the 
wider market. For instance, during the 
2010s, companies with top-tier ESG 
ratings experienced positive earnings 
growth, return on investment, and 
investor dividends on average. In con￾trast, companies with bottom-tier ESG 
ratings experience negative losses on 
the same metrics. Indeed, research 
suggests that modern investors con￾sider fairness in executive pay and the 
culture of the top management team, 
sustainability cultural values (e.g., 
sustainable natural resources, agricul￾ture, carbon emissions, climate), and 
ethics-relevant cultural values (e.g., 
corrupt or toxic cultures) when making 
their investment decisions. As Audrey 
Choi, chief marketing officer and chief 
sustainability officer of Morgan Stanley, 
notes: “The biggest myth—and until 
recently, the biggest obstacle to the 
pursuit of sustainable investing—has 
been that to invest sustainability, one 
must sacrifice returns.” 
 Although investors are paying much 
more attention to organization’s ethical 
and sustainable cultures in their invest￾ment decisions, clearly the biggest 
obstacle now is no longer the miscon￾ception that ESG investments under￾perform the wider market. Instead, the 
biggest obstacle now is awareness. 
For instance, a Morgan Stanley report 
revealed that only 25  percent of indi￾vidual U.S. investors are aware of the 
investing approach at all. Analysts are 
predicting a “tidal wave of growth” in 
the years to come for this practice. 131

researchers at NASA’s Johnson Space Center documented a subculture 
group that became known as the “Pirates.” They were known for directly 
opposing NASA’s early values of hierarchy and revolutionizing the way 
employees ran mission control, resulting in an innovative and cost-focused 
culture.137
Culture as a Liability
Culture can influence employee attitudes and behaviors, which clearly can 
benefit an organization. Culture is valuable to employees too because it spells 
out what is important to organizations. The climates that follow illustrates how 
employees should put what is important into practice. But we should not ignore 
the potentially dysfunctional aspects of culture, especially a strongly negative 
one, on an organization’s effectiveness. NBCUniversal, for instance, has been 
hit with boycotts, declining viewership, downsizing, and leadership shakeups 
in the wake of scandals suggesting it has a toxic culture, wrought with sexual 
harassment, bullying, insensitivity, and abuse.138 Let’s unpack some of the major 
factors that signal a negative organizational culture.
Stagnation and Entrenchment Culture is a liability when shared values do not 
agree with those that further the organization’s effectiveness. This is most 
likely when an organization’s environment is undergoing rapid change, and its 
entrenched culture may no longer be appropriate.139 Consistency of behavior, 
an asset in a stable environment, may then burden the organization and make it 
difficult to respond to changes. Many times, we view this as a decision of mem￾bers to “do what they always did,” when in reality, sometimes they do so without 
even being aware of it.140 For instance, the clothing company Old Navy has 
struggled with stagnation throughout its history. Most recently, many business

Founded in 1969, Samsung 
Electronics of South Korea is past the 
usual innovation life cycle stage yet 
continues to foster a climate of cre￾ativity and idea generation. Samsung 
emulates a startup culture through its 
Creative Labs, where employees like 
engineer Ki Yuhoon, shown here, take 
up to a year off from their regular jobs 
to work on innovative projects.

analysts have commented: “They [Old Navy’s teams] didn’t take any risks... 
I  really think Old Navy has forgotten about the DNA of the brand... You’re 
a fashion team. You can’t just rest on your laurels—you’ve got to be on to the 
next thing.”141 Sometimes the antidote is an invigoration of fresh perspective: 
Employing outside, noncore directors and empowering internal personnel to 
identify and act on opportunities (e.g., intra-preneurship) are potential ways to 
address this negative cultural trajectory.142 Alliances with other organizations 
can help as well. Consider the case of the joint auto plant where GM, whose 
workforce was struggling, teamed up with Toyota. Within just a year’s time, 
GM’s product quality increased, absenteeism dropped by 18  percent to near 
zero levels, strikes stopped, CWBs were squelched, and employees passionately 
embraced the change.143
Uniformity and Rigidity Hiring new employees who differ from organi￾zational members in values, beliefs, or perspectives creates a paradox:144
Management wants to demonstrate support for the differences that these 
employees bring to the workplace, but newcomers who wish to fit in are usu￾ally compelled to accept the organization’s core culture. Second, because 
the influence of different perspectives is likely to diminish as people assimi￾late, strong cultures can become liabilities when they effectively eliminate 
the advantages of diversity. Third, a strong culture that condones preju￾dice, supports bias, becomes insensitive, or overemphasizes differences 
can undermine formal corporate diversity policies or the positive effects of 
demographic diversity.145 Sometimes, this strong culture is perpetuated in 
the relationships people form and maintain without “switching up” mem￾bership. A rigid desire to “keep the peace” with current organizational 
members, take advantage of familiarity and comfort with one another, and 
build long-lasting relationships with those outside the company can thwart 
new relationships and ideas from emerging.146
It seems that these uniformity and rigidity barriers can start at the community 
level: One study of nearly 150 retail bank locations in the United States found 
that the composition of the community serves as an important signal in setting 
the inclusiveness norms that are adopted and made part of an organization’s cul￾ture and climate.147 These barriers can, in part, be addressed through cultures 
and climates of inclusion—by showing the organization’s values and enacting 
them in an inclusive environment, diversity may flourish and employees may be 
more committed to the organization.148 On the other hand, people from various 
backgrounds may perceive the culture and climates differently, undermining the 
effect positive cultures and climates may have on organizational outcomes.149
Toxicity and Dysfunctions We have discussed cultures that cohere around a 
positive set of values and beliefs. This consensus can create powerful forward 
momentum. However, coherence around negative and dysfunctional manage￾ment values in a corporation can produce downward forces that are equally 
powerful yet toxic. When most people think of toxic cultures, they often think 
of cultures that have sink-or-swim beliefs, supporting abuse, harassment, or mis￾treatment to keep and maintain power. These detrimental cultural features can 
have devastating effects in organizations.150
As another example, research on hundreds of bank employees in about 150 
branches of a large bank in the United States suggests that branch managers 
model conflict management styles, which then shape conflict cultures within each 
branch.151 Dominating conflict cultures (i.e., encouraging active confronta￾tion and aggressive competition among employees when there is conflict) tend 
to reduce branch cohesion and customer service performance. Collaborative 
cultures (i.e., encouraging proactive, constructive, and collaborative conflict 
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 568 13/12/22 3:18 AMOrganizational Culture and Change CHAPTER 16 569
resolution), on the other hand, tended to increase the cohesion and satisfaction 
of the branch and decrease levels of burnout. Avoidance cultures (i.e., those 
that passively avoid conflict) tend to be less creative.
Toxic cultures do not just influence conflict in organizations—other dys￾functions matter as well. For instance, some organizations are solely focused 
on the bottom line numbers and results without caring how those numbers 
and results are achieved.152 For instance, one former SpaceX employee com￾mented on the results-oriented culture, working 12-plus-hour days and pulling all￾nighters at the office—but enjoying the freedom to be able to meet the results 
on his own terms.153 It is not that results-oriented cultures are toxic in and of 
themselves—it is just that they can be detrimental without an ethical culture to 
keep employees from disengaging from the ethical aspects of their work. Some 
cultures, such as those characterized by “lean management practices” (e.g., 
see the chapter on organizational structure),154 can become toxic as employ￾ees are constantly afraid of losing their jobs (i.e., job insecurity culture). When 
employees are constantly in fear of their jobs, they may often forego certain 
important behaviors (e.g., safety) to accomplish their work more quickly.155
Culture Clashes Historically, when management looked at acquisition or merger 
decisions, the key decision factors were potential financial advantage and product 
synergy. In recent years, cultural compatibility has become the primary concern.156
All things being equal, whether the acquisition works seems to have much to do 
with how well the two organizations’ cultures match up. When they do not mesh 
well, the organizational cultures of both become a liability to the whole new orga￾nization. A study conducted by Bain and Company found that 70 percent of merg￾ers failed to increase shareholder values, and Hay Group found that more than 
90 percent of mergers in Europe failed to reach financial goals.157 Considering 
this dismal rate of success, Lawrence Chia from Deloitte Consulting observed, 
“One of the biggest failings is people. The people at Company A have a different 
way of doing things from Company B... you can’t find commonality in goals.”
For example, one employee of a creative company acquired by a larger one 
who was transplanted from the East Village to Wall Street (in New York City) 
suggested the move was “more than physical, representing the scrappy creative 
adolescent putting on a tie.”158 In order for mergers or acquisitions to be suc￾cessful, cultural integration is essential, as well as flexibility and complementar￾ity in employee skills.159 (Think back to the chapters on groups and teams and 
what we know about team diversity.)
Some cultures succeed despite their dysfunctional cultures. We can only won￾der how much more successful these cultures would be if they reformed their 
toxic cultures. There are many more cases of business success stories due to 
excellent organizational cultures than there are of success stories despite bad 
cultures and almost no success stories because of bad ones. Research suggests 
that part of the reason why culture affects an organization’s performance is 
through customer satisfaction: One study of nearly a hundred automobile deal￾erships over a six-year time frame found that a positive culture leads to improved 
sales performance because it increases customer satisfaction.160
Influencing Organizational Cultures
As we discussed, the culture of an organization is set by its founders and is 
often difficult to change. Cultures are ideally established by a strong founder 
or founders who carefully plan the organization’s culture beforehand, setting a 
solid foundation to weather times of crisis and success. That is seldom the case, 
16-5 Describe the similarities 
and differences in 
creating positive, ethical, 
and innovative cultures.
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 569 13/12/22 3:18 AM570 PART 4 The Organization System
though; organizational culture usually grows organically over time. When we 
think of the development of culture as ongoing and conducted through each 
employee, we can see ways to increase the positive and ethical aspects of the 
environment, which we discuss next.
Developing a Positive Culture
At first, creating a positive culture may sound hopelessly naive or like a 
Dilbert-style conspiracy. The one thing that makes us believe this trend is here 
to stay, however, is signs that management practice and OB research are con￾verging. A positive organizational culture emphasizes building on employee 
strengths, rewards more than it punishes, and encourages individual vitality and 
growth.161 Let us consider each of these areas.
Building on Employee Strengths Although a positive organizational culture does 
not ignore problems, it does emphasize showing workers how they can capital￾ize on their strengths.162 As management guru Peter Drucker once said, “Most 
Americans do not know what their strengths are. When you ask them, they look 
at you with a blank stare, or they respond in terms of subject knowledge, which 
is the wrong answer.”163 Why not be in an organizational culture that helped you 
discover your strengths and how to make the most of them? Indeed, research 
from Gallup suggests that employees who have an opportunity to use their 
strengths every day are six times more likely to be engaged on the job.164 How do you 
build on employee strengths? Help them find out what they are. For instance, 
one UK investment management company designated coaches to help employ￾ees understand their strengths and how to leverage them. These employees were 
able to develop their skills, adapt to changing conditions, and perform better.165
Rewarding More Than Punishing Although most organizations are sufficiently 
focused on extrinsic rewards such as pay and promotions, they often forget 
about the power of smaller (and cheaper) rewards such as praise (see the 
chapters on motivation). Part of creating a positive organizational culture is 
“catching employees doing something right.” Many managers withhold praise 
because they are afraid employees will coast or because they think praise is not 
valued. However, as Charles Schwab once said, “I have yet to find the person, 
however great or exalted [in] station, who did not do better work and put forth 
a greater effort under a spirit of approval than [they] would ever do under a 
spirit of criticism.”166 Employees generally do not ask for praise, and manag￾ers usually do not realize the costs of failing to give it. Moreover, employees 
are often motivated by social inclusion and feeling like they belong to some￾thing greater than themselves. Validating and actively including employees 
who contribute positively to the organization can be one way of developing a 
positive culture.167
Consider O.C. Tanner, one Great Place to Work–certified company that con￾ducted a survey on how managers can improve employee engagement. One 
of the questions on the survey asked, “What is the most important thing that 
your manager or company currently does that would cause you to produce great 
work?” In their own words, overwhelmingly, the majority of the employees asked 
said “more personal recognition” would be encouraging. Indeed, many organi￾zations and consulting firms have recognized the positive influence of recogni￾tion cultures in improving organizational, team, and employee outcomes.168
Encouraging Vitality and Growth No organization will get the best from employ￾ees who see themselves as mere cogs in the machine. A positive culture recognizes 
the difference between a job and a career. It supports not only what the employee 
positive organizational culture A culture 
that emphasizes building on employee 
strengths, rewards more than punishes, and 
emphasizes individual vitality and growth.

contributes to organizational effectiveness but how the organization can make the 
employee more effective—personally and professionally. Top companies recognize 
the value of helping people grow. Safelite AutoGlass attributes its success in part to its 
award-winning PeopleFirst Plan talent development initiative. “The only way we can 
stand out is if we have the best people,” says Senior Vice President Steve Miggo.169
Limitations of Positive Cultures Is a positive culture a cure-all? Though many 
companies have embraced aspects of a positive organizational culture, it is a 
new enough idea for us to be uncertain about how and when it works best. 
Not all national cultures value being positive as much as the U.S. culture does, 
and even within U.S. culture, there surely are limits to how far organizations 
should go. The limits may be dictated by the industry and society. For example, 
Admiral, a British insurance company, has established a Ministry of Fun in its 
call centers to organize poem writing, foosball, conkers (a British game involv￾ing chestnuts), and fancy-dress days, which may clash with an industry value 
of more serious cultures.170 When does the pursuit of a positive culture start 
to seem coercive? As one critic notes, “Promoting a social orthodoxy of posi￾tiveness focuses on a particular constellation of desirable states and traits but, 
in so doing, can stigmatize those who fail to fit the template.”171 This has led 
many to deem positivity that has been taken to the extreme as toxic positivity—
an approach that imposes unrealistic and psychologically damaging effects on 
employees who are pressured to be perfect and pure while actively avoiding 
perfectly natural negative states and conditions.172 There may be benefits to 
establishing a positive culture, but an organization also needs to be objective 
and not pursue it past the point of effectiveness.
Developing an Ethical Culture
Despite differences across industries and cultures, ethical cultures share some 
common values and processes.173 Therefore, managers can create a more ethi￾cal culture and climate by adhering to the following principles:174
• Be a visible role model. Employees will look to the actions of top manage￾ment as a benchmark for appropriate behavior, but everyone can be a 
role model to positively influence the ethical atmosphere. Send a positive 
message.
• Communicate ethical expectations. Whenever you serve in a leadership capac￾ity, minimize ethical ambiguities by sharing a code of ethics that states 
the organization’s primary values and the judgment rules employees must 
follow.
• Provide ethical training. Set up seminars, workshops, and training programs 
to reinforce the organization’s standards of conduct, clarify what practices 
are permissible, and address potential ethical dilemmas.
• Visibly reward ethical acts and punish unethical ones. Evaluate subordinates 
on how their decisions compare with the organization’s code of ethics. 
Review the means as well as the ends. Visibly reward those who act ethi￾cally and conspicuously punish those who do not.
• Provide protective mechanisms. Seek formal mechanisms so everyone can dis￾cuss ethical dilemmas and report unethical behavior without fear of rep￾rimand. These might include identifying ethical counselors, ombudspeo￾ple, or ethical officers for liaison roles.
A widespread positive ethical climate must start at the top of the organiza￾tion.175 When top management emphasizes strong ethical values, supervisors 
are more likely to practice ethical leadership. Clear expectations transfer down 
to line employees, who show lower levels of deviant behavior and higher levels 
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 571 13/12/22 3:18 AM572 PART 4 The Organization System
of cooperation and assistance. Several other studies have come to the same gen￾eral conclusion: The values of top management are a good predictor of ethical 
behavior among employees. For example, one study involving auditors found 
perceived pressure from organizational leaders to behave unethically was associ￾ated with increased intentions to engage in unethical practices.176 Clearly the 
wrong type of organizational culture can negatively influence employee ethical 
behavior. Conversely, ethical leadership has been shown to improve group ethi￾cal voice, or the extent to which employees feel comfortable speaking up about 
issues that seem unethical to them, through improvements in ethical culture.177
Finally, employees whose ethical values are similar to those of their department 
are more likely to be promoted, so we can think of ethical culture as flowing 
from the bottom up as well.178
Developing an Innovative Culture
How can an organization become more innovative (see the chapter on per￾ception and decision making)? Although there is no guaranteed formula, 
certain characteristics surface repeatedly when researchers study innovative 
organizations.
Sources of Innovation Structural variables are one potential source of innova￾tion.179 A comprehensive review of the structure–innovation relationship leads 
to the following conclusions:
1. Organic structures positively influence innovation. Because they are lower 
in vertical differentiation, formalization, and centralization, organic organi￾zations (see the chapter on organizational structure) facilitate the flexibility, 
adaptation, and cross-fertilization that make the adoption of innovations 
easier.180
2. Contingent rewards positively influence innovation. When creativity is re￾warded, firms tend to become more innovative—especially when employees 
are given feedback on their performance in addition to autonomy in doing 
their jobs.181
3. Innovation is nurtured when there are slack resources. Having an abun￾dance of resources allows an organization to afford to purchase or develop 
innovations, bear the cost of instituting them, and absorb failures.182
4. Interunit communication is high in innovative organizations. These organi￾zations are heavy users of committees, task forces, cross-functional teams, 
and other mechanisms that facilitate interaction across departmental 
lines.183
Context and Innovation National cultures have an effect on innovation in organi￾zations:184 One study using global data from a crowdsourcing company suggests 
that the more a country is characterized by strong social norms and low toler￾ance for any deviation from the norm, innovation tends to be stifled.185 Cultural 
diversity at the local level also has an impact. Having close, interpersonal rela￾tionships (both romantic and friendship) with those from different culture back￾grounds (such as those from international assignments) sparks innovation and 
entrepreneurship.186
Innovative organizations tend to have similar contextual features. First, they 
encourage experimentation, reward both successes and failures, and celebrate 
mistakes.187 Second, they tend to share a common vision as well as underlying 
goals.188 Third, they also tend to be cohesive, mutually supportive, and encour￾aging of innovation.189 Fourth, they leverage human resources (HR) systems to 
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 572 13/12/22 3:18 AMOrganizational Culture and Change CHAPTER 16 573
promote innovation. For example, they promote the training and development 
of their members so they keep current, offer high job security so employees do 
not fear getting fired for making mistakes, and encourage individuals to become 
change agents (as discussed later in this chapter).190 Work systems emphasizing 
commitment to employees increase team innovation.191 These effects were even 
greater in teams where there was cohesion among coworkers.
Idea Champions and Innovation Martha Samuelson, CEO and chair of Analysis 
Group (a global economics consulting firm), believes the best ideas have champi￾ons who signal that they are worthwhile. She states that any idea that she intends 
to gain traction at the Analysis Group needs a champion, whom she trusts to be 
strategic, effective, and smart. This person needs to stand behind the idea and 
effectively adapt to setbacks. Coming up with and implementing new ideas is a 
challenge for anyone at any company. A competent idea champion accepts this 
challenge and demonstrates to others that there is belief in the idea and that it 
has potential.192
Once a new idea has been developed, idea champions actively and enthu￾siastically promote it, build support, overcome resistance, and ensure it is 
implemented.193 Champions often have similar personality characteristics:194
extremely high self-confidence, persistence, energy, and a tendency to take 
risks. They usually display traits associated with transformational leadership—
they inspire and energize others with their vision of an innovation’s poten￾tial and their strong personal conviction about their mission. Managers and 
employees alike should also be aware of the other types of reactions employ￾ees can have to the idea over time: For example, doubters will probably never 
get on board with the new idea, converts will start to like the idea more and 
more, and defectors are more likely to dislike the idea over time.195 Keeping 
in mind these audiences, change agents can vary their message to try to obtain 
the best result.
Situations can also influence the extent to which idea champions are 
forces for change. For example, passion for change among entrepreneurs is 
greatest when work roles and the social environment encourage them to put 
their creative identities forward. On the flip side, work roles that push creative 
idea champions Individuals who take an 
innovation and actively and enthusiastically 
promote the idea, build support, overcome 
resistance, and ensure that the idea is 
implemented.

Based on its motto “Think Different,” 
Apple has built a culture of innovation 
where employees share a passion for 
creating consumer-friendly products 
like the Apple Watch, shown here 
displayed by a customer at an Apple 
store in Toronto, Canada. Apple’s 
supportive culture embraces cross￾fertilization of ideas, collaboration, 
experimentation, and risk taking.

individuals to do routine management and administration tasks diminish both 
the passion for and implementation of change.196 Idea champions are good at 
gaining the commitment of others, and their jobs should provide considerable 
decision-making discretion. This autonomy helps them introduce and imple￾ment innovations197 when the context is supportive.
Change
During the first quarter of 2018, 52.2 million iPhones were sold, compared with 
78.2 million Samsung sales. Contrast this with the first quarter of 2019, in which 
considerably fewer (42  million) iPhones were sold, versus noticeably fewer 
(72  million) Samsung phones. In the first quarter of 2019, a new company, 
realme, split off from the Chinese mobile phone company OPPO and began 
progressively capturing market share through the first quarter of 2021. (It now 
has 4 percent of the market share.) At the same time, in the first quarter of 2018, 
roughly one-third (33 percent) of the market share was captured by boutique 
companies, and the remaining market share was captured by giants including 
the ranks of Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo, and Huawei. Although some companies cap￾ture roughly the same share of the market each quarter (e.g., Samsung, Apple), 
other companies experienced 5 percent or greater growth over the three-year 
span (e.g., Xiaomi, vivo) whereas others experienced 5 percent or greater losses 
(e.g., Huawei).198 The 33  percent of market share left captured by boutique 
companies had been shrunk to 18 percent in the first quarter of 2021.
In this and many markets, competitors are constantly entering and exiting the 
field, gaining and losing ground quickly. However, sometimes this change is not 
entirely due to the efforts of the people within the company and is catalyzed by 
forces beyond the companies’ control, for better or worse (see Exhibit 16-7 for

operates both within and 
outside organizations.

a summary and examples of forces behind organizational change). During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, companies like Zoom, DoorDash, and Amazon 
saw their revenues and profit margins skyrocket as people worked remotely, ordered 
delivery and takeout more often, and had common household items delivered.199
It seems that change is a constant in this and many other environments.
The Nature of Change
Change is simply when things become different than the way they were. 
When changes are implemented, it leads to a natural redistribution of val￾ues, priorities, and resources that reverberate throughout the organiza￾tion and transform employees interactions.200 Oftentimes, changes are 
unplanned and happen naturally—however, certain situations involve pro￾active, intentional, and goal-oriented efforts to realize change, which all 
describe planned change.201 For example, a major automobile manufacturer 
spent several billion dollars to install state-of-the-art robotics. Because the 
planned introduction of new equipment dramatically changed the jobs in 
the quality-control area and because management anticipated considerable 
employee resistance to it, executives developed a program to help people 
become familiar with the new equipment.
What are the goals of planned change? First, it seeks to improve the ability 
of the organization to adapt to changes in its environment. Second, it seeks to 
change employee behavior.
Who in organizations is responsible for managing change activities? The 
answer can be found in change agents.202 They see a future for the organization 
others have not identified, and they are able to motivate, invent, and implement 
this vision.203 Some change agents look to transform old industries to meet new 
capabilities and demands. For instance, Mashonda Tifrere left an impressive 
music publishing deal after being confronted with rampant sexism and bigotry 
in the music industry to be a change agent, founding ArtLeadHER, a platform 
to increase women’s representation in the visual arts (backed by Beyoncé’s 
BeyGOOD and Gucci’s Chime for Change).204
Change agents can be managers or nonmanagers, current or new employ￾ees, or outside consultants. Some research suggests that different change agents 
should be employed at various stages of the instance. For example formal lead￾ers may be important earlier on to provide clarity and expectations, whereas 
peer change agents are important later on to motivate others to adopt the 
changes long-term.205 However, many change agents fail because organizational 
members resist change. In the next section, we discuss resistance to change and 
what managers can do about it.
Resistance to Change
We often see change as threatening. Employees and managers alike who feel 
negatively toward a change cope by not thinking about it or even leaving the 
organization.206 These reactions can sap the organization of vital energy when it 
is most needed.207 Indeed, resisting change can be emotionally exhausting for 
employees.208 Exhibit 16-8 summarizes major forces for resistance to change, 
categorized by their sources. Individual sources reside in human characteristics 
such as perceptions, personalities, and needs. Organizational sources reside in 
the structural makeup of organizations themselves.
Resistance does not necessarily surface in standardized ways. It can be overt, 
implicit, immediate, or deferred.209 It is easiest for management to deal with 
overt and immediate resistance such as complaints, a work slowdown, or a strike 
threat. The greater challenge is managing resistance that is implicit or deferred 
change When things become different than 
the way they were.
planned change Change activities that are 
proactive, intentional, and goal-oriented.
change agents People who act as catalysts 
and assume the responsibility for managing 
change activities.
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 575 13/12/22 3:18 AM576 PART 4 The Organization System
because these responses—loss of loyalty or motivation, increased errors or 
absenteeism—are more subtle and more difficult to recognize for what they 
are. Deferred actions also cloud the link between the change and the reaction 
to it, sometimes surfacing weeks, months, or even years later. Or a single change 
of little inherent impact may be the straw that breaks the camel’s back because 
resistance to earlier changes has been deferred and stockpiled.
Is change good or bad? It is worth noting that not all of it is good. Rapid, 
transformational change is risky, so change agents need to think through the 
full implications carefully. Speed can lead to bad decisions, and sometimes those 
initiating change fail to realize the full magnitude of the effects or their true 
costs. Furthermore, during an acquisition, employee and middle manager resis￾tance to change can be reduced through a slow, rather than fast, transition.210
However, resistance to change can be positive if it leads to open discussion and 
debate.211 These responses are usually preferable to silence (see the chapter on 
politics) and can indicate that members of the organization are engaged in the 
process, providing change agents an opportunity to explain the change effort. 
Change agents can also monitor the resistance to modify the change to fit the 
preferences of members of the organization.
Overcoming Resistance to Change Eight tactics can help change agents deal with 
resistance to change.212 Let us review them briefly.
1. Communication Communication is more important than ever in times of 
change.213 Changes are most effective when a company communicates a 
Individual Sources
Habit—To cope with life’s complexities, we rely on habits or programmed responses.
But when confronted with change, this tendency to respond in our accustomed ways
becomes a source of resistance.
Security—People with a high need for security are likely to resist change because it
threatens their feelings of safety.
Economic factors—Changes in job tasks or established work routines can arouse
economic fears if people are concerned that they will not be able to perform the new
tasks or routines to their previous standards, especially when pay is closely tied to
productivity.
Fear of the unknown—Change substitutes ambiguity and uncertainty for the
unknown.
Selective information processing—Individuals are guilty of selectively processing
information in order to keep their perceptions intact. They hear what they want to
hear, and they ignore information that challenges the world they have created.
Organizational Sources
Structural inertia—Organizations have built-in mechanisms—such as their selection
processes and formalized regulations—to produce stability. When an organization is
confronted with change, this structural inertia acts as a counterbalance to sustain
stability.
Limited focus of change—Organizations consist of a number of interdependent
subsystems. One cannot be changed without af fecting the others. So limited
changes in subsystems tend to be nullified by the larger system .
Group inertia—Even if individuals want to change their behavior, group norms may
act as a constraint.
Threat to expertise—Changes in organizational patterns may threaten the expertise
of specialized groups.
Threat to established power relationships—Any redistribution of decision-making
authority can threaten long-established power relationships within the organization.
Exhibit 16-8 Sources of Resistance to Change

rationale that balances the interests of various stakeholders (sharehold￾ers, employees, community, customers) rather than those of shareholders 
only.214 Moreover, formal information sessions can decrease employees’ 
anxiety about the changes, while providing high-quality information about 
the changes can increase their commitment to it.215 Framing may also play a 
role. If the changes are framed (and perceived) as threatening, people may 
not comply, whereas if they are seen as a challenge or a positive influence 
on their working lives, they are more likely to champion the change, comply 
with it, and become engaged with their work.216
2. Participation It is difficult to resist a change decision in which we have par￾ticipated. Assuming participants have the expertise to make a meaningful 
contribution, their involvement can reduce resistance, obtain commitment, 
and increase the quality of the change decision.217 One study of the Sicilian 
anti-Mafia organization the Addiopizzo found that by involving organiza￾tions in directly questioning the pizzo (i.e., paying protection money to the 
Mafia) through an appeal to values (e.g., critical consumption, integrity, 
pride), they were able to successfully challenge the Mafia.218 Studies of 
change crafting also suggest that resistance to change can be reduced when 
employees are given the autonomy to structure their jobs to meet these 
changing demands.219 However, against these advantages are the negatives: 
the potential for a poor solution, a great consumption of time, and height￾ened resistance when employees already have too many job demands.220
3. Building Support and Commitment When managers or employees have low 
emotional commitment to change, they resist it and favor the status quo.221
Employees are also more accepting of changes when they are committed to 
the organization as a whole.222 So, providing organizational support (e.g., 
coaching and training programs to cope with the change) and developing 
a positive climate can enable employees to emotionally adjust to the change 
rather than embrace the status quo.223 Counseling, new-skills training or a 
short paid leave of absence may facilitate adjustment to change when em￾ployees’ anxieties about the change are high.
4. Develop Positive Relationships People are more willing to accept changes 
if they trust the change agents implementing them and see them as legiti￾mate.224 One study surveyed hundreds of employees from a large housing 
corporation in the Netherlands that was experiencing a merger. Those 
who had a more positive relationship with their supervisor and who felt 
that the work environment supported development were much more posi￾tive about the change process.225 There is also a contrast effect, in which 
people are more willing to accept changes from a new leader when the 
older leader was ineffective, abusive, or too hands-off.226 Underscoring 
the importance of social context, other work shows that even individuals 
who are generally resistant to change will be more willing to accept new 
and different ideas (and can even experience less stress) when they feel 
supported by their coworkers and believe the environment is safe for tak￾ing risks.227 On the other hand, relational fault lines in teams (see the 
chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations) negatively im￾pact and undermine strategic change initiatives.228 To facilitate positive 
relationship building, change agents should create spaces for employees 
to interact and communicate with one another as well as create guidelines 
for interaction that facilitate relationship building.229
5. Implementing Changes Fairly One way organizations can minimize nega￾tive impact is to make sure change is implemented fairly for coworkers, the 
organization, and other parties.230 As we saw in the chapter on motivation 
concepts, procedural fairness is especially important when employees per￾ceive an outcome as negative, so it is crucial that employees see the reason 
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 577 13/12/22 3:18 AM578 PART 4 The Organization System
for the change, are kept informed about its progress, and perceive its im￾plementation as consistent and fair.231 Moreover change recipients are not 
always self-interested: They focus on the impact that change has on their 
coworkers, the organization, and other parties when evaluating fairness.232
Implementing changes fairly does not only affect whether employees accept 
or resist changes—it can also have a positive effect on change recipients’ 
trust in the change agents.233
6. Manipulation and Cooptation Manipulation refers to covert influence at￾tempts.234 Twisting facts to make them more attractive, withholding infor￾mation, and creating false rumors to get employees to accept change are all 
examples of manipulation. For example, when Billy McFarland (cofounder 
of the Fyre Festival) was exposed for fraudulent practices, he told them that 
“work is your family.” As one employee recounted, “We’re not a family. You 
won’t even tell me anything!”235 Cooptation, on the other hand, combines 
manipulation and participation.236 It seeks to buy off members of a resisting 
group by giving them a key role, seeking their advice not to find a better 
solution but to get their endorsement. For example, the “right to repair” 
movement opposes manufacturing companies’ monopolization of product 
repairs: Companies like Samsung co-opt by allowing customers to seek out 
“authorized repair providers,” but they still can block repairs or decide the 
terms for the repair. As Nathan Proctor, director of the Right to Repair cam￾paign, emphasizes, “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they 
fight you... but then, as a last-ditch effort, they co-opt you.” Both manipula￾tion and co-optation are relatively inexpensive ways to gain the support of 
adversaries, but they can backfire if the targets become aware that they are 
being tricked or used. Once that is discovered, the change agent’s credibil￾ity may drop to zero.
7. Selecting People Who Accept Change Research suggests the ability to 
accept and adapt easily to change is related to personality—some peo￾ple are simply more resistant or receptive to change.237 On one hand, 
Machiavellian employees (see the chapter on personality and individual 
differences) are more likely to react strongly to change initiatives by re￾ducing their engagement and looking for new jobs.238 On the other hand, 
individuals who are emotionally stable, have high core self-evaluations, are 
willing to take risks, and are flexible in their behavior are prime candi￾dates.239 Individuals higher in general mental ability are also better able 
to learn and to adapt to changes in the workplace.240 In sum, an impres￾sive body of evidence shows organizations can facilitate change by select￾ing people predisposed to accept it.
8. Coercion Last on the list of tactics is coercion, the application of direct 
threats or force on the resisters (see the chapter on power and poli￾tics).241 Examples include threatening employees with forced transfers, 
blocked promotions, negative performance evaluations, and poor letters of 
recommendation. Coercion is most effective when some force or pressure 
is enacted on at least some resisters—for instance, if an employee is publicly 
refused a promotion request, the threat of blocked promotions will become 
a real possibility in the minds of other employees. However, as you may re￾member from the chapter on power and politics, coercion and pressure in 
general are hardly effective tactics and almost always backfire eventually.
The Politics of Change
No discussion of resistance would be complete without a brief mention of 
the politics of change. Because change invariably threatens the status quo, it 
inherently implies political activity. The impetus for change is more likely to 
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 578 13/12/22 3:18 AMOrganizational Culture and Change CHAPTER 16 579
come from outside change agents, employees new to the organization (who 
have less invested in the status quo), or managers slightly removed from the 
main power structure. Managers who have spent a long time with an orga￾nization and who have achieved a senior position in the hierarchy are often 
major impediments to change. Of course, as you might guess, these long￾time power holders tend to implement merely incremental changes when 
they are forced to introduce change. Radical change is often considered too 
threatening. This explains why boards of directors that recognize the imper￾ative for rapid and radical change frequently turn to outside candidates for 
new leadership.242
Approaches to Managing Organizational 
Change
We now turn to several approaches to managing change: Lewin’s classic 
three-step model, Kotter’s eight-step plan, action research, and organizational 
development.
Lewin’s Three-Step Model
Kurt Lewin argued that successful change in organizations should follow three 
steps: unfreezing the status quo, movement to a desired end state, and refreezing the 
new change to make it permanent243 (see Exhibit 16-9).
By definition, status quo is an equilibrium state. To move from equilibrium—
to overcome the pressures of both individual resistance and group 
conformity—unfreezing must happen in one of three ways (see Exhibit 16-10). 
For one, the driving forces, which direct behavior away from the status quo, can 
be increased. For another, the restraining forces, which hinder movement away 
from equilibrium, can be decreased. A third alternative is to combine the first two 
approaches. Companies that have been successful in the past are likely to encoun￾ter restraining forces because people question the need 
for change.244 Once the movement stage begins, it is 
important to keep the momentum going. Organizations 
that build up to change do less well than those that get 
to and through the movement stage quickly. When 
change has been implemented, the new situation must be 
refrozen so it can be sustained over time. Without this last 
step, change will likely be short-lived, and employees will 
attempt to revert to the previous equilibrium state.
Scholars in recent years have criticized Lewin’s model for sev￾eral reasons.245 First, like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (see the 
chapter on motivation concepts), Lewin assumes that change 
happens sequentially, in order, always progressing. Second, the 
model implies a sense of perfect agency for managers. In other 
words, do change agents really know where they are, where 
the people in the organization are, and where they are going? 
Organizations are so fluid that it may be impossible to do this in 
real life. Still others have mentioned that the “freezing” language 
is somewhat problematic: Time keeps moving, freezing may 
never really happen, and new changes interrupt current changes 
dynamically. Indeed, more modern approaches to understand￾ing change in organizations consider issues such as timing, pac￾ing, rhythm, and the nature of the change agents involved.246
16-7 Compare the four main 
approaches to managing 
organizational change.

away from the status quo.

movement from the existing equilibrium.

Kotter’s Eight-Step Plan
John Kotter built on Lewin’s three-step model to create a more detailed 
approach for implementing change.247 Kotter began by listing common mis￾takes managers make when trying to initiate change. They may fail to create 
a sense of urgency about the need for change, a coalition for managing the 
change process, or a vision for change. They also may fail to communicate 
effectively about it and/or anchor the changes to the organization’s culture. 
Moreover, they could also fail to remove obstacles impeding the vision’s achieve￾ment and/or provide short-term and achievable goals. Finally, they may declare 
victory too soon.
Addressing these impediments to change, Kotter established eight sequen￾tial steps to overcome these problems. They are listed in Exhibit 16-11.
Notice how Kotter’s first four steps essentially extrapolate Lewin’s “unfreez￾ing” stage. Steps 5, 6, and 7 represent “movement,” and the final step works on 
“refreezing.” So Kotter’s contribution lies in providing managers and change 
agents with a more detailed guide for successfully implementing change.
Action Research
Action research is a change process based on the systematic collection of data 
and selection of a change action based on what the analyzed data indicate.248
Its value is in providing a scientific methodology for managing planned change. 
Action research consists of five steps (note how they closely parallel the scientific 
method): diagnosis, analysis, feedback, action, and evaluation. Applications of 
action research have been successful at improving the engagement of nursing 
staff249 as well as in making supply chain systems more sustainable,250 for exam￾ple. Furthermore, action research has been utilized by Optum, a healthcare 
company, through involving customer service specialists in determining more 
effective ways of engaging with customers.251
The change agent, often an outside consultant in action research, begins 
by gathering information about problems, concerns, and needed changes 
from members of the organization. This diagnosis is analogous to a physician’s 
search to find specifically what ails a patient. Diagnosis is followed by analysis.
What problems do people focus on? What patterns do these problems seem 
to take? The change agent synthesizes this information into primary concerns,

on systematic collection of data and then 
selection of a change action based on what 
the analyzed data indicate.

1. Establish a sense of urgency by creating a compelling reason for why change is needed.
2. Form a coalition with enough power to lead the change.
3. Create a new vision to direct the change and strategies for achieving the vision.
4. Communicate the vision throughout the organization.
5. Empower others to act on the vision by removing barriers to change and encouraging
risk taking and creative problem solving.
6. Plan for, create, and reward short-term “wins” that move the organization toward the
new vision.
7. Consolidate improvements, reassess changes, and make necessary adjustments in the
new programs.
8. Reinforce the changes by demonstrating the relationship between new behaviors and
organizational success.

problem areas, and possible actions. Action research requires the people who 
will participate in a change program to help identify the problem and deter￾mine the solution. So the third step—feedback—requires sharing with employees 
what has been found from the first and second steps. Now the action part of 
action research is set in motion. The employees and the change agent carry 
out the specific actions they have identified to address the problem together. 
The final step, consistent with the scientific underpinnings of action research, 
is evaluation of the action plan’s effectiveness, using the initial data gathered as 
a benchmark.
Action research provides at least two specific benefits. First, it is 
problem-focused. The change agent objectively looks for problems, and the 
type of problem determines the type of change action. A second benefit of 
action research is the lowering of resistance. Because action research engages 
employees so thoroughly in the process, it reduces resistance to change. Once 
employees have actively participated in the feedback stage, the change process 
typically takes on a momentum of its own. However, organizations may resist 
participating in action research when their legitimacy is potentially or already 
at risk.252
Organizational Development
Organizational development (OD) is a collection of change methods that try to 
improve organizational effectiveness and employee well-being.253
OD methods value human and organizational growth, collaborative and par￾ticipative processes, and a spirit of inquiry.254 Contemporary OD borrows heav￾ily from postmodern philosophy in placing heavy emphasis on the subjective 
ways people see and make sense of their work environment. The change agent 
may take the lead in OD, but there is a strong emphasis on collaboration. Below, 
we describe OD techniques or interventions for bringing about change.
Process Consultation Managers often sense that their unit’s performance can 
be improved but are unable to identify what to improve and how. The purpose 
of process consultation is for an outside consultant to assist a client, usually 
a manager, through crafting “a relationship through a continuous effort of 
‘jointly deciphering what is going on’... to make coauthored choices about how 
to go on.”255 These events might include those surrounding workflow, informal 
relationships among unit members, and formal communication channels.
Process consultation assumes we can improve organizational effectiveness 
by dealing with interpersonal problems through participation and involvement. 
Compared with other OD approaches, it is more task-directed, and consultants 
do not solve the organization’s problems but rather guide or coach the client to 
solve their own problems after jointly diagnosing what needs improvement. The 
client develops the skill to analyze processes within their unit and can therefore 
use the skill long after the consultant is gone. Because the client actively partici￾pates in both the diagnosis and the development of alternatives, they arrive at a 
greater understanding of the process and the remedy, becoming less resistant to 
the action plan chosen.
Team Building We have noted throughout this text that organizations 
increasingly rely on teams to accomplish work tasks. Team building (see the 
point-counterpoint from the chapter on teams) uses high-interaction group 
activities to increase trust and openness among team members, improve coor￾dination efforts, and increase team performance.256 For example, a number of 
companies are turning to “escape rooms” as a team building method (where 
members have to work together and solve puzzles in order to escape a themed

and employee well-being.

team building High interaction among

openness.

room).257 As one Baltimore employee who participated in an escape room 
team-building exercise noted, “What comes out of an experience like that is a 
depended sense of relationship and community ... once inside, it’s when fun 
and team-building intersect at a high level.”258
Team building typically includes goal setting, development of interpersonal 
relations among team members, role analysis to clarify each member’s role and 
responsibilities, and team process analysis. It may emphasize or exclude certain 
activities, depending on the purpose of the development effort and the spe￾cific problems the team is confronting. Basically, however, team building uses 
high interaction among members to increase trust and openness. In these times 
when organizations increasingly rely on teams, team building is an important 
topic.
Intergroup Development A major area of concern in OD is dysfunctional con￾flict among groups. Intergroup development seeks to change groups’ attitudes, 
stereotypes, and perceptions about each other.259 Here, training sessions closely 
resemble diversity training, except rather than focusing on demographic differ￾ences, they focus on differences among occupations, departments, or divisions 
within an organization. Once they have identified the causes of discrepancies, 
the groups move to the integration phase—developing solutions to improve 
relations between them. Subgroups can be formed of members from each of 
the conflicting groups to conduct further diagnoses and formulate alternative 
solutions.260
Among several approaches for improving intergroup relations, a popular 
one emphasizes problem solving.261 Each group meets independently to list its 
perceptions of itself and another group and how it believes the other group 
perceives it. The groups then share their lists, discuss similarities and differ￾ences, and look for causes of disparities. Are the groups’ goals at odds? Are 
the perceptions distorted? On what basis were stereotypes formulated? Have 
some differences been caused by a misunderstanding of intentions? Have words 
and concepts been defined differently by each group? Answers to questions 
like these clarify the exact nature of the conflict. Once they have identified the 
causes of discrepancies, the groups move to the integration phase—developing 
solutions to improve relations between them. Subgroups of members from each 
of the conflicting groups can conduct further diagnoses and formulate alterna￾tive solutions.
Appreciative Inquiry Most OD approaches are problem-centered. They identify 
a problem or set of problems and then look for a solution. Appreciative inquiry
instead accentuates the positive. Rather than looking for problems to fix, it seeks 
to identify the unique qualities and special strengths of an organization, which 
members can build on to improve performance.262 It has been demonstrated to 
be an effective change strategy in organizations such as GTE, Roadway Express, 
American Express, and the U.S. Navy.263 The U.S. dairy industry used it to trans￾form its sustainability efforts, resulting in nearly $300 million in projects that were 
singled out as models for other industries.264
The appreciative inquiry process consists of four steps—discovery, dreaming, 
design, and destiny—often played out in a large-group meeting over two or three 
days and overseen by a trained change agent. Discovery sets out to identify what 
people think are the organization’s strengths. Employees recount times they felt 
the organization worked best or when they specifically felt most satisfied with 
their jobs. In dreaming, employees use information from the discovery phase to 
speculate on possible futures, such as what the organization will be like in five 
years. In design, participants find a common vision of how the organization will

look in the future and agree on its unique qualities. For the fourth step, partici￾pants seek to define the organization’s destiny or how to fulfill their dream, and 
they typically write action plans and develop implementation strategies.
The Change Paradox
Managers can learn a few lessons from paradox theory,265 which states that the 
key paradox in management is that there is no final optimal status for an orga￾nization.266 In a paradox situation, we are required to balance tensions across 
various courses of action, which are caused by resource scarcity.267 There is a 
constant process of finding a balancing point, a dynamic equilibrium, among 
shifting priorities over time.268 The first lesson is that as the environment and 
members of the organization change, different elements take on importance. 
For example, sometimes a company needs to acknowledge past success and 
learn how it worked, while at other times looking backward will only hinder 
progress. There is some evidence that managers who think holistically and 
recognize the importance of balancing paradoxical factors are more effective, 
especially in generating adaptive and creative behaviors in those they are man￾aging.269 However, leaders who adopt paradoxical approaches may fall into the 
trap of escalation of commitment (see the chapter on perception and decision 
making) given that they may be more optimistic that the current state of affairs 
will swing toward a more desirable one. In summary, a critical truth in OB is that 
change is constant—and so, too, are adaptation and adjustment to that change.
Summary
Organizational culture has a profound effect on organizational effective￾ness, the behavior of its members, and how it responds to new challenges and 
changes in its environment. Values, beliefs, and underlying assumptions are the 
features that comprise culture and are what differentiate organizations from 
one another. Although organizational cultures can take on similar forms to one 
another, the picture is more complicated than it seems. For instance, subcul￾tures can form regardless of the strength of the dominant culture. Cultures are 
initially established by the organization’s founders, who select employees and 
managers they know will support its mission and values. Over time, the culture 
perpetuates as top management selects those who fit this prototype and “teach” 
employees culture through socialization practices. Employees learn culture by 
observing and participating in the organization’s stories, rituals, symbols, and 
language. How does culture influence organizational effectiveness? It does so 
through the formation of climates, which establish policies, practices, and pro￾cedures that realize organizational values. In this way, organizations can real￾ize positive (e.g., ethicality, sustainability, innovation) or negative (e.g., toxicity, 
rigidity, conflict) aims. Organizational leaders should aspire to develop posi￾tive, ethical, and innovative cultures if their mission and objectives call for it. 
However, organizational change is a massive challenge in and of itself. Leaders 
can proactively manage and plan for change, although often, their efforts will 
not always be successful. When leaders or employees act as change agents, they 
must overcome change resistance, navigate organizational politics, and manage 
the process of change. Several tools are available to accomplish these aims, but 
no one tool by itself is a “silver bullet.” Overall, change is a constant, creating 
a paradox: There is no final optimal or perfect state. Therefore, cultural trans￾formation and change management will almost always amount to unfinished 
business.
paradox theory The theory that the key 
paradox in management is that there is no 
final optimal status for an organization.

Implications for Managers
● Realize that an organization’s culture is relatively fixed in the short term. 
To effect change, strategize a long-term plan.
● Although every culture is unique in its own way, researchers have un￾covered four competing values that tend to have reliably similar effects 
on organizational outcomes. For innovation, try to build a clan culture. 
For customer satisfaction and quality, try to build a market culture. For 
employee attitudes and performance, try to build an adhocracy. Finally, 
if profitability and revenue are most important, try to build a hierarchy 
culture.
● Although you may think you have a strong, dominant culture, looks can 
be deceptive. You may be surprised to find that there are subcultures in 
departments, teams, or other work units. If you encounter these subcul￾tures, try to determine what caused them to splinter off in the first place 
and decide what you can do to meet the needs of these employees.
● Stories, rituals, material symbols, and language are powerful mechanisms 
you can leverage to build and maintain culture.
● Starting a new company is a tall order—the decisions you make set the 
tone and foundation for the entire culture of your organization. Careful 
planning and strategizing are paramount to building positive, ethical, sus￾tainable, innovative cultures.
● Several HR processes perpetuate culture: selection, top management, and 
socialization (onboarding) all play a role in transmitting culture. If you 
are looking to transform culture, start with these processes.
● Although values, beliefs, and underlying assumptions are relatively fixed 
aspects of culture, leaders can build organizational climates that realize 
these values.
● Managers would do wise to avoid culture traps. Stagnation, entrench￾ment, uniformity, rigidity, toxicity, and other dysfunctions can cause orga￾nizations to fail if they do not adapt and change.
● To build a positive culture, seek to develop employee strengths, reward 
more than punish, and encourage growth and vitality, but recognize 
that some negativity is perfectly natural, and positivity does not mean 
perfectionism.
● To build an ethical culture, be a visible role model for appropriate be￾havior, communicate ethical expectations, provide ethics training, reward 
(and punish) (un)ethical behavior, and protect whistleblowers.
● To build an innovative culture, focus on creating structures and contexts 
that nurture innovation, and ensure leaders “champion” their ideas to 
others so they catch on.
● To inspire organizational change, recognize that the process is extremely 
difficult and there is a high likelihood for failure. (That does not mean 
that the effort is not worthwhile, however.)
● Depending upon the nature of what you are trying to change, there are a 
variety of mechanisms and tools available (such as those provided by the 
field of organizational development) to facilitate change.

 Organizational Change Management Is Not Worth the Effort 
POINT 
With the failure rate of organizational change estimated to 
be roughly 70 percent, it is clear that organizational change 
management is not working. Surveys of employees at 
organizations that have undergone transformations reveal that few 
respondents believe the organizations’ change efforts have improved 
performance or sustained improvements. 
 Research has demonstrated that individuals have a negative bias 
toward preserving the status quo. For example, when someone is of￾fered a bet with an equal probability of winning or losing, the average 
person requires a gain of twice the value of the potential loss before 
accepting the bet. Thus, a natural tendency to prefer avoiding losses 
rather than achieving equivalent gains leads individuals to prefer the 
status quo rather than change. Within organizations, this risk-averse 
behavior is compounded when there are thousands of individuals re￾sistant to change. 
 As organizational behavioral experts Kenneth Thompson and Fred 
Luthans have noted, an individual’s reaction to organizational change 
can be extreme and immediate. As a result, starting a new organiza￾tion can even be easier than trying to change an existing one. For 
many years, those attempting to create change in organizations have 
viewed it as linear and sequential. In fact, it is often non-linear and 
can often be chaotic for those trying to manage change and employ￾ees who are forced to undergo dramatic changes. 
COUNTERPOINT 
 W e need to stop relying on the excuse that organizational 
change is too hard. Of course, we are biased toward ex￾pecting failure instead of success and this bias is hardwired 
into our brains. As a result, individuals perceive successful outcomes 
as rare and undesirable results as evidence that change is impos￾sible. However, it is not true that organizational change is impossible. 
Rather, there are steps individuals can take to facilitate effective or￾ganizational change. 
 Successful transformation in organizations often starts in small 
groups that are loosely connected but share a similar purpose. 
Although leaders can advocate and give voice to the shared purpose, 
persuading others of the value of the change cannot just come from 
the top. For example, when Wyeth Pharmaceuticals began imple￾menting lean manufacturing practices—a major transformation—it 
began doing so with just a few groups at a few factories. Gradually the 
practices were successfully implemented by thousands of employees 
across more than a dozen factories. The result was a 25 percent re￾duction in costs. Shaping individuals’ mindsets can have a significant 
effect on the success of organizational change. University of Chicago 
researchers found that reminding people that most individuals can 
improve with a little effort led these people to notice positive changes 
more quickly than negative ones. If leaders prime employees with the 
simple idea that a change can have a high probability of success, 
they can reduce negative biases against that change. 
 Organizational change is indeed difficult and requires significant 
effort. However, this does not invalidate the fact that organizational 
change can succeed when using the right strategies. Change man￾agement is worth the effort as organizational change allows compa￾nies to succeed and grow, but only if employees can understand and 
commit to the changes and work effectively throughout the transfor￾mation process. 270

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
In this chapter, you were introduced to organizational 
culture and change. You should also know now that they 
both matter—a poor organizational culture, in many 
ways, can be a make-or-break factor for an organization. 
Organizational cultures are now taken very seriously by 
organizations. By learning about organizational cultures 
and how they work, you are improving your employabil￾ity by enabling you to adapt to distinct types of cultures, 
to craft positive organizational cultures if you are to be 
in a leadership position, and to demonstrate your fit with 
the values of a company at which you are interviewing. 
You are also aware of the negative aspects of organiza￾tional culture that will help you avoid or circumvent po￾tentially troublesome situations when you are either on 
the job or applying to an organization with a negative 
organizational culture. Moreover, you learned just how 
difficult it is to change organizational cultures, how they 
are often ingrained in organizations by their founders, 
and how change efforts can be very slow and drudging. 
Nonetheless, you were equipped with many strategies 
to proactively manage organizational change, even if 
these practices do not enjoy guaranteed success. In this 
chapter, you improved your critical thinking, creativity, 
social responsibility, and leadership skills by evaluating 
the permanence of an organization’s culture, differen￾tiating between compassionate cultures in the banking 
industry, debating whether organizational change man￾agement is worth the effort, and considering the benefits 
of ESG investing. In the next section, you will improve 
your critical thinking and creativity skills and your ca￾reer management skills by designing an organizational 
culture of your own, considering how you can change a 
toxic culture as a leader, and questioning the pros and 
cons of active cultures.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Culture Architects
Form groups of three to four students. Each group will be 
the founders of a new organization. The members of each 
group will draw on what they learned in the chapter and 
other materials to set the foundation for an effective or￾ganizational culture for their new company. Each group 
will need to provide the following information about their 
new culture and to justify their answers:
Name of the organization
Product or service provided
Founding members
Mission or vision statement
Three primary values guiding the organization
Five core beliefs that guide the conduct of business in the 
organization
Three examples of organizational policies, practices, or procedures 
that further the organization’s vision or that reinforce the values
One or more material symbols or symbols that represent the or￾ganization’s mission or values (can be a logo, description of 
clothes, use of language or jargon, and so on)
Questions
16-8. Was it difficult to come to a consensus on any of 
these elements when crafting the culture? What 
sorts of disagreements arose, and how did you 
solve them?
16-9. Do you think this foundation will definitely lead 
to the culture you intended? Why or why not? 
What sorts of changes, roadblocks, or other 
events might you see changing the culture or 
making it drift toward something that was not 
intended?
16-10. What types of specific socialization practices 
could you use so that new employees can best 
adapt to the organizational culture?
ETHICAL DILEMMA Toxic Culture
You arrive to work one morning to find the office sur￾rounded by fire trucks. It turns out an employee was re￾sponsible for the fire. A few days earlier, you had made 
an unpopular announcement that the company would 
be closing its warehouse and trucking operations. These 
would be outsourced to FedEx. The news had not gone 
over well. Unfortunately, you knew that this incident was a 
symptom of a larger problem.
As the new CEO, you were determined to root out the 
toxic culture that had developed. There was clearly a lack 
of trust throughout the organization, negative employee 
attitudes, and resistance to collaboration. It started at the 
top with the majority owner, who had no formal position 
but was very involved in the company and created a cul￾ture of fear. It was evident that employees were afraid of 
him, and he preferred it that way. Even in your e-mail ex￾changes with him, he was aggressive and abusive.
After six months, you were able to buy out the majority 
owner. However, you knew that was just the first step. At 
the headquarters in California, you spent time meeting 
with the top thirty people at the company. You had these 
employees fill out a culture survey to gather anonymous 
M16_ROBB0025_19_GE_C16.indd 586 13/12/22 3:18 AMOrganizational Culture and Change CHAPTER 16 587
feedback and created a new mission statement and com￾pany values based on their input. Although you spent 
time communicating these throughout the company, over 
the next few months, nothing changed. Some employees 
had been working at the company for many years and did 
not feel compelled to change.
More drastic change was needed, so you decided to 
move the headquarters from California to Colorado. 
The move made sense as you lived in Colorado and most 
of the executives did as well. Leaving California would 
also allow you to leave behind employees who were im￾peding your ability to dismantle the toxic culture. Next, 
you and the executive team went through and assessed 
each employee on both competencies and cultural fit. 
People were rated as positive cultural influences, neutral, 
or cultural detractors. Individuals who were cultural de￾tractors, no matter how competent, were not invited to 
move with the company. Many of these individuals were 
long-tenured employees who were too entrenched in the 
negative, toxic culture. Although the move was not easy 
or without its costs, you and the executive team were con￾fident that these significant changes were necessary. By 
shedding these cultural detractors, it would allow for a 
more positive, collaborative culture.
Questions
16-11. Do you agree with this approach to dismantling 
the toxic culture? Explain.
16-12. Are there any other steps you would have taken 
as CEO to cultivate a more positive and collabora￾tive culture? Explain.
16-13. How can one prevent the development of a toxic 
culture such as the one described?271
CASE INCIDENT Culture of Fear
A Sports Direct store is a fixture in nearly every town in 
the United Kingdom. Founded by Mike Ashley in 1982, 
the retailing group has grown to become Britain’s largest 
sporting goods retailer, with approximately 465 stores and 
29,000 employees. However, a number of reports, such as 
by The Guardian in 2015, revealed a number of question￾able work practices. It seems that the company’s success 
may have been underpinned by a culture of fear.
Undercover Guardian reporters at the company’s 
Derbyshire warehouse found individual employees being 
told to work faster via a public-address system and security 
searches at the end of a shift (taking place after employ￾ees had clocked out). Most disturbing was the warning sys￾tem, referred to as the “six strikes.” You could receive a 
“strike” for a number of reasons, including errors in your 
work, having long toilet breaks, or a period of reported 
sickness. Receiving six strikes in a six-month period would 
result in your contract being terminated.
In 2016, a Parliamentary committee was set up to in￾vestigate the claims from The Guardian and other sources. 
They concluded that the success of Sports Direct had 
been achieved through a culture that allowed some em￾ployees to be treated without dignity or respect. Although 
the committee did concede that there were probably 
other organizations guilty of employee mistreatment, they 
identified Sports Direct as a particularly bad example of 
this type of exploitation.
Reviewing evidence regarding the “six strikes” policy, 
the committee heard from a union representative who de￾scribed people coming to work ill as they feared that they 
would receive a strike for calling in sick. This increase in 
presenteeism—going to work when you are too ill to do 
so—poses health and safety risks. Between January 1, 2013, 
and April 19, 2016, a total of 110 ambulances or paramed￾ics were dispatched to the warehouse. Of these, 50 cases 
were classed as life-threatening, including a woman giv￾ing birth in the toilet. Although strikes were often given 
in a very arbitrary manner, the committee concluded that 
workers were unlikely to argue as they were employed as 
agency workers and protest could mean that they would 
probably not be given as many hours of work in the future.
The strict control systems in force suggest a strong 
culture; however, it is difficult to say whether this case 
highlights a subculture specific to the warehouse or a 
dominant culture demonstrating core values across the or￾ganization. It is clear that there was a negative workplace 
climate at the warehouse that was affecting the health and 
well-being of the employees. After the committee, Ashley 
agreed to look into a number of issues, including the “six 
strikes” policy and allegations of bullying and physical 
intimidation. After all, as the founder of the company, a 
cultural change has to be driven by him.272
Questions
16-14. How would you describe the culture at the Sports 
Direct warehouse? How might this culture be a li￾ability to the organization?

Direct?
16-16. With so many stores and employees, how do 
you change the organizational culture at Sports 
Direct? What action do you think should be 
taken and by whom?

 NO RÉSUMÉ NEEDED 
Staffing processes are usually expensive and time-consuming. Organiza￾tions spend roughly $4,100 per employee processing résumés, 
conducting interviews, completing background checks, and administering 
drug tests. At the same time, many business leaders face pressure to adopt 
more inclusive practices in their companies. Hiring practices often exclude 
millions of potential employees, including homeless individuals, previously 
incarcerated individuals, and individuals in recovery. Is it possible, though, 
that there is a solution that allows organizations to meet their specific 
workforce needs while also creating economic opportunities for individuals 
who traditionally face barriers to employment? 
 Since opening in 1982, Greyston Bakery in Yonkers, New York, has 
successfully used an “opening hiring” strategy. The company, which produces 
millions of pounds of baked goods for customers like Ben & Jerry’s and Whole 
Foods Market, has remained successful while also putting money back into 
the community of southwest Yonkers. This approach means individuals are 
offered a position when they are next on the list of people who have indicated 
they are interested in working at the bakery. No background check, drug 
test, job interview, or résumé is required. As a result, Greyston essentially 
has no hiring costs. Instead, the company invests roughly $1,900 into hard 
and soft skills training for each new employee. The key, though, to making 
this strategy successful is the other services that the organization provides. 
Greyston recognizes that for employees to be successful, there are various 
factors outside work that play a role. The bakery connects employees with 
resources to find health insurance, housing, child care, and transportation 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 589 13/12/22 3:21 AM590 PART 4 The Organization System
to ensure they are as successful as possible at their job. Greyston reports 
that using this model can generate a local economic impact of $7 million 
annually. This impact is due to public assistance savings, increased tax 
revenue, and reduced incarceration costs.
Greyston Bakery has not stopped there—it is also working to assist 
other employers with implementing open hiring through its Center for Open 
Hiring. Six businesses have successfully incorporated this model into hiring 
practices, including The Body Shop’s international cosmetics company.
OM-4Although adopting open hiring to the same extent as Greyston Bakery 
may not be possible for every organization, it is likely feasible to apply some 
elements of its practices. While some leaders may have concerns about 
a lack of accountability in this type of system, on the contrary, Greyston 
Bakery has strict standards for employees that are enforced. As Greyston’s 
general manager notes, performance problems are often a result of what is 
happening in an employee’s life today, not due to their past. The company’s 
model has demonstrated that it can prevent these potential issues from 
interfering with employees’ performance. Open hiring is not necessarily for 
all businesses. Still, it can be an impactful, practical, and profitable solution 
to many of the issues that organizations face.1
Human resources (HR) systems and practices—such as employee recruit￾ment, selection, training, and performance management—influence 
people’s behavior in organizations and, ultimately, an organization’s 
effectiveness.2 Why should we care about HR systems and practices in an 
organizational behavior (OB) textbook? The answer is that HR and OB are 
inextricably linked—with HR systems and practices influencing manager and 
employee behavior and vice versa.3 And the cycle never ends. As Suzanne Lucas, 
a former HR consultant for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and Wegmans Food Markets 
(who goes by the pseudonym “Evil HR Lady”), notes: “HR problems never, ever 
end. You will never have a day when you can say, ‘I’m finished. All the employees 
are happy. All the policies and procedures comply. All managers have the 
proper training. And everyone is getting along just beautifully.’ This will never 
happen.”4 All the more reason to get a pulse on what you can do, as a manager 
and as an employee, to navigate HR systems and behavior in organizations. Let 
us discuss the most important HR systems (e.g., recruitment, selection, training, 
and performance management) and their effect on OB, beginning with the 
recruitment function.
Recruitment
The first stage in any HR system is recruitment,5 closely followed by selection 
(i.e., the hiring process). Organizations spend a considerable amount of money 
on recruitment. On average, they spend about $4,425 per hire ($14,936 per 
executive hire).6 These expenses amount to nearly 15 percent of the entire HR 
budget on average.7 A selection system can only be as good as the individuals 
who apply in the first place.8 In fact, over the last century, researchers have

recruitment methods.
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 590 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 591
suggested that recruitment and selection, which dictates the flow of talent into 
organizations, is the “Supreme Problem” facing HR managers.9 Recruitment is 
very important for OB because how job seekers, applicants, recruiters, employ￾ees, and managers behave during this process can make the difference between 
a job offer acceptance or losing out on a great employee.
Applicant Attraction
To solve this “Supreme Problem,” strategic recruitment has become a corner￾stone for many companies. These recruitment practices are developed in align￾ment with long-term strategic goals. As for defining “success” in recruiting, most 
research suggests that the best systems attract the most qualified candidates.10
Such candidates are likely to have a better fit between their skills and the job 
requirements and to be more satisfied in the jobs they take. Therefore, the 
primary recruitment outcome of interest in OB is applicant attraction, or the 
degree to which an individual is drawn toward an organization, intends to apply 
for a job at that organization, and would accept a job offer if given one.11
Although some individuals’ personality traits (e.g., extroversion and consci￾entiousness) predispose them toward attraction in general,12 applicant attrac￾tion is largely driven by the characteristics of the position and organization 
(i.e., pay, reputation), job seekers’ perceived fit with the organization, their 
impressions of the recruiter, the fairness of the recruitment process (e.g., timely 
responses), and whether they believe they will be successful if they apply and get 
the job.13 Of these characteristics, perceived fit and impressions of the recruiter 
appear to be most important early on in the recruitment process.14 Moreover, 
material symbols (e.g., the logo, imagery, social media presence; see the chap￾ter on culture and change) play a major role. They signal the organization’s 
values (e.g., corporate social responsibility, innovation), which may or may not 
resonate with the job seeker.15 Corporate talent acquisition and management 
professionals actively seek to manage these impressions.16 However, there is a 
dark side to applicant attraction: Vague job requirements can lead applicants to 
come to the wrong conclusions about the nature of the job and lead job seekers 
to feel entitled to being hired or deserving of a higher salary.17 HR professionals 
should be very clear and specific in their communications about who they are 
looking for to avoid any misunderstanding.
The Ubiquity of Referral Hiring
A look at the OB Poll demonstrates that most hiring managers and HR profes￾sionals responsible for hiring source their applicants through their professional 
networks (61 percent). Many organizations actively encourage this practice of 
referral hiring, or when a hiring manager decides to hire a job seeker based 
on their own previous experiences with that individual or a recommendation 
from a referrer (e.g., a previous coworker, a friend from college). People are 
motivated to refer others for positions, perhaps because their organization 
pays them referral “bonuses” for bringing qualified applicants on board or per￾haps as a way to enhance their reputation, reduce the risk of hiring someone 
“no one knows,” or otherwise strengthen the relationships between people in 
the network. These referred job seekers often have the upper hand. Their stron￾ger social ties and the referrer’s reputation can influence the hiring decision 
and give them access to privileged information. Once on the job, their preexist￾ing relationships make the onboarding process easier, as a social tie between the 
hiring manager and the hiree already exists.18
Even though everyone does it, should they? Research is just beginning to test 
the usefulness of this practice. One perspective suggests that referral hiring enriches

which an individual is drawn toward an 
organization, intends to apply for a job at 
that organization, and would accept a job 
offer if given one.
referral hiring When a hiring manager 
decides to hire a job-seeker based on 
their own previous experiences with that 
individual, or a recommendation from a

M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 591 13/12/22 3:21 AM592 PART 4 The Organization System
the workplace. Call center employees who refer their friends and network con￾tacts to work at their company stay longer and perform better than those who do 
not engage in referral hiring.19 On the other hand, the perspective of the other 
employees matters quite a bit. For instance, referrers with a great deal of power 
(see the chapter on power and politics) are often viewed by other employees as 
self-interested and power-seeking. In this dynamic, the other employees are more 
likely to judge the referrer and the job seeker more harshly and support the hiring 
decision less than if the referral was from someone lower in power.20
The Role of Recruiters
Companies are increasingly turning away from outside recruiting agencies and 
relying on their own executives and HR professionals for talent searches.21 As 
shown in the OB Poll, 49 percent of organizations use external recruiters, and 
28  percent of organizations use in-house recruiters to source their executive 
and managerial talent.22 However, the numbers reverse for non-executive tal￾ent: 89 percent of organizations use their own in-house talent for recruitment 
initiatives.23 If the organization has a large applicant flow (i.e., continuously 
sourcing and hiring people for a revolving door of open positions), it may 
want to consider creating dedicated recruiter positions. On average, dedi￾cated recruiters can handle 2.7 times more requisitions (i.e., open positions) 
than HR professionals with other responsibilities.24 Indeed, research on over 
seventy-eight thousand job seekers has demonstrated that the role of recruiters 
is important in reaching out to potential applicants (e.g., students) early on in 
their careers and providing them with rich information.25
The most effective recruiters—internal or external—are well informed 
about the job, are efficient in communicating with potential recruits, and treat 
recruits with consideration and respect.26 In addition, internal recruiters must 
use fair and just practices while recruiting employees because fairness percep￾tions are related to job offer acceptance.27 Recruiters also use various online 
tools, including job boards and social media, to bring in applications. Online 
recruiting has yielded an exponentially increased number of applications, even 
as the means to identify the best online recruitment sources are still develop￾ing.28 Social networking services have facilitated many connections. Some orga￾nizations are pioneering unique methods, such as online programming contests 
that masquerade as games, to identify individuals with top skill sets who may be 
attracted to apply for positions. These contests have been successful in recruit￾ing applicants from all over the globe.29
As a final note on recruiters, it is important to recognize that just as bias 
can filter into hiring managers’ and interviewers’ perceptions of candidates, so 
does it filter into recruiters’ perceptions of job seekers. For instance, recruiters 
tend to provide job-seeking women with less information on leadership posi￾tions than men and feel more anxious when interacting with them.30 Moreover, 
job seekers from unrepresented racial groups report receiving less recruitment 
source information in total, which can lead them to be less attracted to certain 
job positions than other job seekers and perform worse during the hiring pro￾cess itself.31 Instead, recruiters should seek to tailor their signals to meet the 
diverse needs of the various people they interact with (especially in cross-cultural 
contexts),32 provide equal access to recruitment materials to all potential job 
seekers,33 and use recruitment as an opportunity to showcase the organization’s 
own diversity management efforts.34 It is also worth noting that it is a two-way 
street.35 If recruiters’ prejudicial behavior leads underrepresented job seekers 
to have negative experiences, it may very well cause them to take their talents 
elsewhere (e.g., competitors)36 and for job seekers to “spread the word” about 
their experiences to others.37
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 592 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 593
 Realistic Job Previews 
 Employers are increasingly using recruitment methods beyond signaling values 
and attracting job seekers into the realm of previewing the actual work per￾formed and evaluated. These are sometimes known as realistic job previews or 
job tryouts. They are given to demonstrate to job seekers what they would be 
doing on the job. Realistic job previews help to clarify and manage applicant 
expectations. For instance, SHL (a management consulting and assessment 
development firm) offers a realistic job preview for the sales professionals it 
hires. 38 Potential applicants can determine whether the job is right for them 
before even beginning an application. Experts are finding that they decrease 
turnover because both employers and new hires know what they are getting into 
ahead of time. 39
 However, there is a “human” element to realistic job previews beyond merely 
managing applicants’ expectations and preventing turnover. As Melissa Corwin, 
the VP of Employee Experience at AT&T, puts it, “[We make] sure that incom￾ing candidates really understand AT&T’s values, culture, and what it’s like to 
work here. We’ve created job preview videos that we constantly refresh so candi￾dates get a truly accurate, comprehensive view of what it’s like to be in a specific 
role and a specific environment at AT&T.” 40 Moreover, Stacy Van Meter (VP 
Talent Acquisition at Deluxe) notes that through using realistic job previews, 
Deluxe can ensure that “every candidate [walks] away from their experience 
feeling like they matter, whether they got the job or not.” 41

M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 593 13/12/22 3:21 AM594 PART 4 The Organization System
Selection
One of the most important HR functions is hiring the right people. When 
companies hire the right people, they increase their human capital resources. 
Human capital resources are the capacities available to an organization through 
its employees.42 The resources include specialized skills, collective knowledge, 
abilities, and other resources available through an organization’s workforce. 
These resources can be activated through leaders’ behaviors (see the chapter 
on leadership).43 Moreover, they change over time as the person and environ￾ment shift (e.g., as employees develop new skills, as role requirements for a 
position change).44
How does a manager figure out who the right people are from the sea of job 
seekers, applicants, and candidates? Identifying the right people who meet the 
demands and requirements of the job, whose abilities fit the needs of the open 
position, and who match the culture of the company is the objective of the selection 
process. This process matches individual characteristics (ability, experience, and so 
on) with the job requirements.45 When management fails to get a proper match 
for a position, employee performance and satisfaction both suffer, which can lead 
the employee to find a job elsewhere. The cost of turnover is not only up to twice 
that employee’s annual salary, it is also losing that individual’s contribution to the 
organization’s human capital resources—a contribution that could very well be 
taken to a competitor.46 Therefore, it is paramount to ensure that your organiza￾tion has an effective method for identifying the most qualified applicants.
How the Selection Process Works
Exhibit 17-1 shows how the selection process works in most organizations. 
Having decided to apply for a job, applicants go through several stages—three 
are shown in the exhibit—during which they can be rejected at any time. In 
practice, organizations often under-emphasize some of these steps (or forego 
them entirely) in the interest of saving time or not scaring away candidates. For 
example, crime scene cleaners are in high demand, and the job can pay upward 
of $80,000 annually. However, they do not require many of the basic qualifica￾tions used for many other jobs (e.g., years of experience, higher education).47
Regardless, most organizations follow a process that looks something like this 
exhibit. Let us go into a bit more detail about each stage.
Initial Selection
Initial selection methods are used for preliminary rough cuts to decide whether 
the applicant meets the basic qualifications for a job. Application forms, résu￾més, and cover letters are initial selection methods. Background checks are 
either an initial selection method or a contingent selection method, depending 
on how the organization handles them. Some organizations prefer to look into 
an applicant’s background right away. Others wait until the applicant is about to 
be hired, contingent on everything else checking out.
Application Forms You have probably submitted your fair share of applications 
for jobs, college, or other reasons. By itself, the information submitted on an 
application form is not a very useful predictor of performance.48 However, such 
a form can be a good initial screen (if the information is, in fact, required to suc￾cessfully complete the job responsibilities). For example, there is no sense in 
interviewing an applicant for a registered nurse position if the applicant does 
not have the proper credentials (e.g., education, licensure).

Exhibit 17-1 Model of Selection Process in Organizations
Initial Selection
Goal: Use for preliminary ”rough cuts”
to decide whether an applicant meets
the basic qualifications for a job.
Examples: Application forms,
background checks
Substantive Selection
Goal: Determine the most qualified
applicants from among those who
meet basic qualifications.
Examples: Written tests, performance
tests, interviews
Applicant receives job offer.
Applicant applies for job.
Applicant meets basic qualifications.
Applicant is among best qualified.
Contingent Selection
Goal: Make final check before
making offer to applicants.
Examples: Drug tests, medical exams
Applicants who do not meet
basic qualifications are rejected.
Applicants who meet basic
qualifications, but are less qualified
than others, are rejected.
Applicants who are among best
qualified, but who fail contingent
selection, are rejected.
Managers must be careful about the questions they ask on applications. 
Obviously, questions about protected class membership (see the chapter on 
diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations) are disallowed. However, other 
questions also put companies in legal jeopardy. For example, applications 
should not inquire about marital status, dependents, and family obligations. As 
a general rule, organizations should only ask about qualifications that can be 
demonstrated as relevant to the job. Moreover, it is important to realize that 
legal issues should not be the only thing employers worry about. Applicants who 
encounter unnecessary or illegal questions on an application may feel alienated 
and discouraged from completing the application.49 As such, the organization 
may miss out on otherwise well-qualified applicants.
Many organizations encourage applicants to apply online. Generally, it takes 
applicants only a few minutes to complete the application. The application can 
easily be accessed by the people responsible for making the hiring decision. 
Most organizations (the Society for Human Resource Management [SHRM] 
estimates about 85  percent of larger corporations)50 have a careers page on 
their websites where prospective employees can search for positions by location 
or job type and then apply online. With advancements in technology, many HR 
departments can easily screen applications. Employers can also use an applicant 
tracking system (ATS). They can use an ATS to take the initial applications and 
automatically create unique applicant records. Organizations can digitally 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 595 13/12/22 3:21 AM596 PART 4 The Organization System
manage these records and add to them as the applicants move through the 
selection process.51 Taking this a step further, employers can scan applications 
(and résumés) for keywords and qualifications without physically going through 
every application—they can even use machine learning (see the introductory 
chapter) to translate applicants’ work experience into predictions of whether 
they will be successful on the job or turn over.52
When you are the candidate, be careful about what you put on your online 
applications. Although it may be easy to lie on an application, employers can just 
as easily identify these lies and disqualify you from the job. For instance, prior 
job seekers have listed the same dates for every job on their application. One 
claimed they were a CIA counterterrorism expert (while the dates of employ￾ment suggested they would have been a child at the time). One even claimed 
to have studied under Friedrich Nietzsche (who died more than one hundred 
years before the application was received).53 Moreover, although some may 
think including a picture with your application might demonstrate professional￾ism and improve your chances (and it may be required for some high-security 
jobs), it is best not to do this.54 Including a picture may open up the potential 
for discrimination and unconscious bias. As a result, managers may immediately 
not consider applications with pictures attached and may view them as unpro￾fessional and distracting. Including a picture may also lead to errors in your ATS 
record (because the ATS may not be equipped to read pictures).
Résumés and Cover Letters Some positions, mostly management and execu￾tive roles, ask for résumés and cover letters along with the application. Résumés 
and cover letters are often the first exposure these companies have to you as 
an applicant, and you get to control what goes on them. ATS systems are often 
equipped to scan and process these documents in the same way they would with 
normal applications. But beware—just as the ATS may have trouble processing 
an attached photograph, so, too, can ATS systems have issues with unconven￾tional formatting, fonts, and file formats.
Despite the commonality of the traditional “written” résumés and cover 
letters, some job seekers are turning toward creating video résumés, working 
with companies such as Spark Hire to develop video résumés to use in their 
job searches.55 Although this is a recent fad, many employers actually do not 
respond well to them. For instance, one Robert Half survey found that only 
3  percent of hiring managers preferred these. In contrast, an overwhelming 
78 percent preferred the more traditional “written” format.56 Moreover, they 
appear to often harm more than help: It is easier to see through job seekers’ 
impression management tactics via video, and applicants submitting video résu￾més tend to be viewed more negatively than others.57 Of course, perhaps the 
main reason not to use video résumés is to avoid the same discrimination risks 
as submitting photos with an application.58
Can résumés and cover letters be useful in initial selection? The issue with résu￾més and cover letters is that the information requested is not standardized like in 
the rest of the application. Independent raters of the same résumé rarely come to 
an agreement, and job seekers are motivated toward impression management (see 
the chapter on power and politics) on their résumés and cover letters.59 Moreover, 
résumés and cover letters are not immune to disparate impact (see the chapter on 
diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations)—hiring managers often subcon￾sciously judge résumés and cover letters differently based on their assumed ethnic￾ity of the applicants (e.g., communicated from their names, education).60
Background Checks At least 96 percent of employers conduct at least one type of 
background check at some point in the hiring process.61 Although background 
checks are practically universal today (because of technological advancements) 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 596 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 597
and conducted for many reasons (e.g., legal compliance, loss prevention, repu￾tation protection), most organizations (86 percent of organizations surveyed by 
the National Association of Background Screeners [NABS]) do them for one 
primary reason: to protect employees and customers.62 And some evidence sug￾gests that they accomplish this goal. Fifty-six percent of background check users 
reported that their company enjoys more consistent safety and security due to 
their usage.63 Seventy-one percent of organizations uncover issues and informa￾tion about applicants that they otherwise would have missed.64
Reference Checks One common form of background check is the reference 
check. In this practice, the hiring manager reaches out to people who have 
worked with or had contact with the applicant. The problem is that former 
employers rarely provide useful information. In fact, many managers refuse to 
participate in the process because they are afraid of being sued for saying some￾thing bad about a former employee. (It is also possible to be sued for saying 
good things about a poor-performing or interpersonally uncivil applicant!)64
Although many states have passed laws protecting truthful information in refer￾ence checks, most employers play it safe in the United States’ litigious society. 
The result is a paradox: Most employers want reference information, but few 
will give it out. Employers do call personal references for a more candid idea 
of the applicant. However, as many as 30 percent of hiring managers regularly 
discover references that were false or misleading.66 Some organizations have 
turned to reference-checking software that sends 10-minute surveys to refer￾ences. This new technology may result in better (more objective) information.67
Letters of Recommendation Letters of recommendation are another very com￾mon form of background check. These are not as useful as they may seem. 
For instance, in academic contexts, letters of recommendation are only weakly 
predictive of graduate and medical school performance.68 Applicants select 
references who will write positive things about them,69 so almost all letters of 
recommendation are positive. In the end, readers either ignore them or read 
“between the lines” to try to find the hidden meaning. When letters of recom￾mendation do “raise doubt” about the candidate in question, they are often dis￾proportionately brought up for underrepresented groups, potentially leading 
to disparate treatment or impact concerns (see the chapter on diversity, equity, 
and inclusion in organizations).
Moreover, letters of recommendation are almost impossible to compare 
because they differ depending upon who wrote them. Some writers may focus 
on an individual’s educational qualifications, while others may focus on their 
work experience. One classic study found that letters written by different refer￾ences about the same person were less similar than letters written by the same 
reference about different people!70
Informal Social Media “Checks” Many employers perform a general Internet 
search or a targeted search of social networking sites to “find” background 
information on a candidate. The legality of this practice has come into question. 
Still, there is no doubt that many employers include an electronic search to see 
whether candidates have any history that might make them a dubious choice 
for employment. For some potential employees, an embarrassing or incriminat￾ing photo circulated through Facebook may make it hard to get a job. Recent 
research found that recruiters’ ratings did not predict job performance and 
turnover beyond normal selection and screening measures (e.g., traditional per￾sonality measures) and that job seekers’ profiles often contained information 
that could illegally impact hiring decisions (e.g., protected class information 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 597 13/12/22 3:21 AM598 PART 4 The Organization System
and non-work-related personal information like political affiliation, marital sta￾tus).71 Research on these social media background checks suggests they can 
lead to biased hiring decisions regarding women and White candidates.72
Credit History Checks Some employers check credit histories. A bank hiring 
tellers, for example, would probably want to know about a candidate’s credit 
history. Still, credit checks are increasingly being used for nonbanking jobs. 
There is some evidence in favor of this practice. Task performance, organiza￾tional citizenship behavior (OCB), and conscientiousness (which is a predictor 
of job performance; see the chapter on personality and individual differences) 
were predicted by credit scores.73 However, the consistency of the links is 
questioned—research also found that some members of underrepresented 
groups, such as Black job seekers, can be adversely impacted by the use of 
credit scores in selection. In contrast, age and educational attainment were pos￾itively related.74 Because of discrimination concerns and the invasive nature of 
credit checks, employers must be sure there is a need for them (and should be 
sure to comply with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act [FCRA]).
Criminal Background Checks Some employers conduct criminal background 
checks. Currently, 73.5 million U.S. adults (roughly one in three) have crim￾inal records.75 For many with criminal records, it is difficult or impossible 
to find work,76 even during the COVID-19 pandemic when many service 
organizations were extremely short-staffed.77 The U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency responsible for enforc￾ing employment discrimination laws, states that candidates cannot be denied 
employment based only on the findings of background checks (i.e., a blanket 
policy of no convictions) and experts point out that the checks are often inac￾curate anyway.
To complicate matters further, a criminal conviction history can legally 
be used for rejection only if a violation relates to the job or is federally man￾dated (an embezzler could be disqualified for jobs in finance [a related occu￾pation] or as a TSA agent [a federally restricted position], but not in, say, 
the marketing field),77 convictions (and not arrests) are considered, and the 
employer considered alternatives to a background check with less adverse 
impact.79 How can employers navigate the nebulous nature of criminal back￾ground checks? Giving applicants a chance to explain should be a best prac￾tice here (and may even be legally required in some instances). When given 
a chance to explain a conviction, many applicants can redeem themselves in 
the eyes of recruiters. Notably, some companies deliberately set out to hire 
applicants who would not pass background checks, like those with criminal 
backgrounds.80 These organizations value second chances in their cultures 
and report that many of these workers become valuable contributors to their 
organizations and society.
Substantive and Contingent Selection
If an applicant passes the initial selection process, they next pass through sub￾stantive selection. Substantive selection methods are at the heart of the selection 
process and include written tests, performance-simulation tests, and interviews. 
The purpose of substantive selection is to determine the most qualified appli￾cants from those who meet basic qualifications. We will discuss these and 
contingent selection methods, which are usually issued to candidates who pass 
the substantive tests but are offered employment only if they pass final checks.

Written Tests
Long popular as selection methods, written employment tests—traditionally 
called paper-and-pencil tests, although most are now available online—declined 
in use between the late 1960s and mid-1980s, especially in the United States. 
They were frequently characterized as discriminatory, and many organizations 
had not validated them as job-related. Since then, however, there has been a 
resurgence. Today, many organizations have at least considered using one or 
more tests. SHRM reports that up to one-third of thousands of surveyed orga￾nizations use written tests in their selection procedures.81 Managers recognize 
that valid tests can help predict who will be successful on the job.82 Appli￾cants, however, tend to view written tests as less valid and fair than interviews 
or performance tests (discussed later in this section).83 Typical tests include (1) 
intelligence or cognitive ability tests, (2) personality tests, and (3) integrity tests.
Intelligence or Cognitive Ability Tests Tests of intellectual ability/cognitive ability/
intelligence (the terms are sometimes used interchangeably), spatial and mechani￾cal ability, perceptual accuracy, and motor ability (see the chapter on personality 
and individual differences) have long proven valid predictors for the performance 
of many skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled operative jobs.84 Overall, intelligence 
tests have proven to be particularly good predictors for jobs that include cogni￾tively complex tasks (e.g., computer programming and software engineers). Many 
experts say intelligence tests are the single best selection measure across jobs and 
that they are at least as valid in the European Union (EU) as in the United States.85
While cognitive ability tests have long been considered to measure a single, unified 
cognitive capacity, some recent work suggests that they may be useful tests for dif￾ferent specific abilities depending on the job requirements.85 For example, differ￾entiating mathematical, verbal, and technical abilities in hiring processes may lead 
to better predictions of job performance than relying on just one overall cognitive 
ability score. If cognitive ability tests are so predictive of performance, why do only 
16 to 18 percent of organizations surveyed by SHRM use them?87 The answer lies 
in their disparate impact (see the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in 
organizations). Of all the substantive selection methods we discuss in this section, 
cognitive ability tests lead to the most disparate impact.88
Personality Tests Personality tests are inexpensive and simple to administer 
(see the chapter on personality and individual differences for more in-depth 
descriptions). Their use has grown over the years. According to SHRM, per￾sonality tests are most frequently given to executives and middle managers. 
However, they also tend to be administered to individual contributors and 
hourly employees, albeit at a lower rate.89 In general, researchers view personal￾ity tests positively, who remark that traits such as conscientiousness and extrover￾sion predict performance in organizations.
Moreover, concerns about applicants faking responses remain. It is fairly 
easy to claim to be hard-working, motivated, and dependable when asked in a 
job application setting, even if that is not accurate and partly because applicants 
are not always aware they are faking.90 Comparing self-reported personality to 
observer-rated personality found that observer ratings can predict job perfor￾mance and other behaviors, suggesting hiring managers seek out people who 
know the applicants well to fill out personality tests on their behalf.90
Integrity Tests As ethical problems in organizations have increased, integrity 
tests have gained popularity. These tests assess a candidate’s propensity to behave 
(un)ethically.92 They have proven to be powerful alternatives to inaccurate 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 599 13/12/22 3:21 AM600 PART 4 The Organization System
integrity measures, such as polygraphs, in predicting unethical employee behav￾iors such as theft.92 Integrity tests can potentially predict job performance (as 
measured as objectively as possible by supervisors) and of the potential for theft, 
discipline problems, and excessive absenteeism,93 with little disparate impact.94
However, the many available tests do not all predict job performance outcomes 
equally well. In practice, integrity tests may not be as accurate as we might hope, 
may be easily faked depending upon the measure, and applicants react nega￾tively to them, especially when they are misclassified or stigmatized as a result.95
Managers must be careful to choose integrity tests carefully and cautiously, 
use these tests only if there is a business necessity, and ensure that they link 
the need for an integrity test to the job requirements (e.g., handling sensitive 
information).
Performance-Simulation Tests
What better way to determine whether applicants can do a job successfully than 
by having them do it? That is precisely the logic of performance-simulation 
tests. Although they are more complicated to develop and administer than stan￾dardized tests, performance-simulation tests tend to not only have the highest 
validity (because they essentially duplicate the job), but they have higher face 
validity as well (e.g., whether applicants perceive the measures to be accurate). 
Performance simulations are commonly implemented through work samples, 
assessment centers, and situational judgment tests.
Work Sample Tests Work sample tests are hands-on simulations of part or all 
the work that applicants to the job routinely must perform. Applicants’ perfor￾mance on each element of the work sample measures their capability to perform 
a job with more specificity than written aptitude and personality tests, which are 
targeted more toward competencies that predict performance (e.g., traits and 
abilities).97 Work samples are widely used to hire skilled workers such as welders, 
machinists, carpenters, and electricians. Work sample tests are increasingly used 
for all levels of employment.98 However, they differ in their level of fidelity. High￾fidelity work samples seek to duplicate the task itself. But what if it is unrealistic,

routine jobs must perform.

selection methods that help predict 
which applicants will be successful 
on the job.
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 600 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 601
unfeasible, or even dangerous to reproduce the task? Lower-fidelity work sam￾ples, such as virtual reality simulations, enable the organization to provide simi￾lar work samples without the dangers associated with reproducing the task.99
Assessment Centers A more elaborate set of performance-simulation tests, typi￾cally designed to evaluate a candidate’s managerial potential, is administered in 
assessment centers.100 Line executives, supervisors, and/or trained psycholo￾gists evaluate candidates as they go through one to several days of exercises that 
simulate real problems they would confront on the job.101 For example, a candi￾date might be required to role-play a manager who must decide how to respond 
to ten memos in an in-basket within two hours. Assessment centers are good 
predictors of performance; however, some debate their validity because ratings 
may be confounded by many factors.102 For example, the results of assessment 
center exercises may be affected by whether it is easy for applicants to guess the 
traits needed to perform well or by the disposition and initial impressions of 
role players.103
Situational Judgment Tests To reduce the costs of job simulations, many orga￾nizations have started to use situational judgment tests, which ask applicants 
how they would perform in a variety of job situations and then compare their 
answers to the answers of high-performing employees.104 For example, an appli￾cant to a call center might be presented with a fictitious transcript of an angry 
customer and then asked to choose the best response from a series of options. 
Ultimately, the lower cost of the situational judgment test may make it a better 
choice for some organizations than a more elaborate work sample or assessment 
center experience. Moreover, they tend to have moderate validity and relatively 
low disparate impact, making them an attractive substantive method choice.105
Coaching can improve scores on these tests, though, and research has demon￾strated that applicants can identify the correct answers even if the situation is 
masked or removed from the assessment.106 In other words, an applicant would 
choose the correct answer to the angry customer situation described earlier, 
even without the transcript. These issues raise questions about whether they 
reflect true judgment or merely good test preparation.107
Interviews
Of all the selection methods that organizations worldwide use to differentiate can￾didates, the interview has always been standard practice. It also tends to have a 
disproportionate amount of influence. Overreliance on interviews is problematic 
because extensive evidence shows that impression management techniques (see 
the chapter on power and politics) such as self-promotion have a strong effect on 
interviewer preferences even when the displayed traits are unrelated to the job.108
Conversely, the candidate who performs poorly in the employment interview is 
likely to be cut from the applicant pool regardless of experience, test scores, or 
letters of recommendation. And unfortunately, candidates can be rated lower for 
something as trivial as a blemish on their faces, one study found.109
In practice, most organizations use interviews for many reasons. Companies 
such as Southwest Airlines, Disney, Bank of America, Microsoft, and Procter & 
Gamble use interviews to assess applicant–organization fit. In addition to evalu￾ating specific, job-related skills, managers look at personality characteristics and 
personal values to find individuals who fit the organization’s culture and image. 
Some companies also use job interviews as a recruiting tool, trying to “sell” appli￾cants on the value of the job and organization. This strategy may sometimes be 
necessary because of a tight labor market, but it may also be problematic. One 
study showed that interviewers who were trying to promote the organization

selection tests that ask applicants how they 
would perform in a variety of job situations; 
the answers are then compared to the 
answers of high-performing employees.

during interviews were significantly worse at identifying applicant qualifications 
than those who focused exclusively on assessing candidate qualifications.110
Interviews are either structured or unstructured. The popular unstructured 
interview—short, casual, and made up of improvised questions—is simply not a 
very effective selection method.111 The data it gathers is typically biased and often 
only modestly related to future job performance. Still, managers are reluctant 
to use structured interviews—planned interviews designed to gather job-related 
information—in place of their favorite questions,112 such as “If you could be 
any animal, what would you be, and why?” Structured interviews limit subjec￾tivity as much as possible and therefore, can provide more reliable responses. 
For instance, applicants in one structured interview process were asked ques￾tions that gave the interviewer a better understanding of their personalities. In 
one interview question (designed to reflect extroversion), interviewers asked: 
“Sometimes you meet a lot of new people. Think of a situation where you par￾ticipated in a one or two-day training... workshop and where you did not know 
the other participants... Please describe exactly how you perceived this situation 
and what you did in this situation to interact with the other participants.”113 This 
is an excellent start in that the question prompts open-ended responses and is 
standardized for all candidates.114
Contingent Selection Tests
If applicants pass the substantive selection methods, they are ready to be hired, 
contingent on final checks. One common contingent check is a drug test. Publix 
grocery stores make tentative offers to applicants contingent on their passing a 
drug test,115 as do many other organizations.
Drug Testing Drug testing is controversial. Many applicants think testing 
without reasonable suspicion is invasive or unfair. They should be tested 
on job-performance factors, not lifestyle choices that may not be relevant. 
Employers might counter that drug use and abuse are extremely costly, not 
just in financial terms but also in considering people’s safety. In fact, research 
has revealed that the average drug user is 3.6 times more likely to be involved

in an accident, receives three times the amount of sick pay and benefits, is 
five times more likely to make a workers’ compensation claim, and misses 
ten times more workdays than those who do not use drugs. In the United 
States, employers have the law on their side.116 Moreover, drug use involves 
increased costs of $81 billion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and 
increased health care costs.117 The Supreme Court has concluded that drug 
tests are “minimally invasive” selection procedures that, as a rule, do not 
violate individuals’ rights.
But are drug tests accurate? Have they been shown to lead to the improve￾ment of hiring? First of all, many contest the accuracy of drug tests. Some HR 
professionals refer to them as “obsolete” outside occupations that require pub￾lic trust.118 Of the thousands and thousands of people who take urine drug 
tests in the United States, the positivity rate has been consistently below 6 per￾cent since 1996.119 This suggests that drug tests may be relatively insensitive and 
unreliable to measure drug usage in the workforce or that applicants can easily 
“game” the test (dilute, alter, or substitute samples).
Moreover, there is not much research on whether drug tests result in the 
intended outcomes. However, one large-scale study at the U.S. Postal Service 
found that its drug testing and screening program reduced absenteeism and 
turnover but did not affect accidents or injuries.120 Given the lack of validity 
evidence and poor accuracy evidence, many maintain that drug testing does 
not accomplish what it was intended to accomplish. Although not a common 
approach, some researchers suggested that instead of using invasive drug test￾ing, hiring managers could administer personality tests geared toward a pro￾pensity for drug abuse and other risky behavior (e.g., thrill-seeking, unethical 
behavior rationalization, tolerating others’ unethical behavior).121
Medical Examinations Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA; 
described in a later section) U.S. firms may not require employees to pass a 
medical exam before a job offer is made. However, they can conduct medical 
exams after making a contingent offer—but only to determine whether an appli￾cant is physically or mentally able to do the job. Employers also sometimes use 
medical exams to find out whether and how they can accommodate employees 
with disabilities. For jobs requiring exposure to heavy physical or psychological 
demands, such as air traffic controllers or firefighters, medical exams may be an 
important indicator of the ability to perform.122 However, like drug testing, the 
validity of these types of exams is not very compelling. Even more worrisome, it 
is difficult to establish that a medical examination is necessary and job-related.
Therefore, hiring managers who consider using medical examinations as 
a contingent method should follow medical standards and focus only on the 
exact health conditions proven to adversely affect performance. As an exam￾ple, truck-driving and carrier companies are required by the U.S. Department 
of Transportation (DOT) to administer contingent medical examinations. 
However, in doing so, they must also comply with the EEOC and ADA. Carriers 
can reduce the likelihood of litigation by focusing directly on specific medical 
conditions, such as hearing and visual conditions, that are directly related to 
driving success and safety instead of conducting broad “physicals.”123
Training and Development
Competent employees do not remain competent forever. Competence dete￾riorates and can become obsolete, and new skills need to be learned. That 
is why corporations in the United States spend over $70 billion annually on 
17-4 Compare the main types 
of training.
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 603 13/12/22 3:21 AM604 PART 4 The Organization System
training.124 Organizations from retail, wholesale, and customer service indus￾tries dedicate over $10 million annually to training in their budgets.125 The 
number one goal of training is for it to transfer. This transfer of training refers 
to utilizing the knowledge, skills, and abilities learned from training on the 
job.126 What good is dedicating millions and billions of dollars to training if 
no one puts it to use? When training is done well, it can help boost the orga￾nization’s human capital and even the employees’ career competencies, trans￾ferrable to future jobs.127
What does training look like? On-the-job training methods include job rota￾tion, apprenticeships, and understudy assignments. U.S. companies have been 
increasingly using longer-term job rotations to cross-train employees and to fos￾ter collaboration.128 For instance, companies like ADP and Verizon offer their 
employees the opportunity to learn about different jobs and aspects of the busi￾ness processes through job rotation.129 However, on-the-job training methods 
often disrupt the flow of work or would be better performed removed from the 
work context.
Therefore, organizations also invest in off-the-job training. Most of the expen￾ditures we cited earlier for training are largely spent on this formal, off-the-job 
variety, the most popular method being live workshops or sessions (or multi￾ple workshops organized within training programs). But it also encompasses 
self-directed training, e-learning, mobile learning, webinars, podcasts, and mas￾sively open online courses (MOOCs).
Larger organizations are increasingly building corporate universities to 
house formal training programs and have been doing so since the 1960s 
(although many perhaps incorrectly assume they are a recent development!).130
For example, JetBlue University in Orlando, Florida, trains airline pilots and 
supporting flight crews on the policies, practices, and procedures all in one 
place, simulating real-world flight scenarios (which would not be acceptable to 
hold on the job).131 The formal instruction given in the corporate university 
classes is often supplemented with informal online training or informal experi￾ential training.132

Training Content
Training can include everything from teaching employees simple machine 
operation, improving executive leadership, helping employees become more 
accepting of diversity, and increasing work–life balance (discussed later in the 
chapter).132 Throughout the text, we have described several different training 
foci, from leadership to diversity to ethics. The goal of training is for employ￾ees to learn something and enhance their knowledge by acquiring knowledge, 
skills, abilities, and other characteristics the organization can draw on as human 
capital resources (discussed earlier).134
Although some do not make this distinction, training is different from educa￾tion. Education primarily focuses on acquiring knowledge, such as facts and figures 
necessary to do a job or the steps in a complicated process. Training, on the other 
hand, spans beyond merely acquiring knowledge toward application. Training 
is more concerned with building skills, developing abilities, and even acquiring 
competencies like adaptability, emotional competence, and leadership.
As a student, you have been working toward acquiring many basic skills (e.g., 
reading, math, problem-solving, critical thinking) that may be transferable 
to your career. On the other hand, most training that organizations offer are 
focused on technical skills (e.g., learning how to effectively use new software, pro￾grams, applications; learning how to code in various programming languages) 
or soft skills (e.g., managing and regulating one’s emotions effectively; build￾ing relationships; communicating clearly and efficiently). One area of soft skills 
that is particularly important in the workplace is ethics training, which focuses 
on recognizing moral issues, regulating moral emotions, considering different 
perspectives, and acting ethically by treating others with respect and civility. For 
instance, holding directed conversations about ethics and supporting the reduc￾tion of incivility on an ongoing basis is one form of training. Following this 
intervention, civility, respect, job satisfaction, and trust increased, while incivil￾ity, cynicism, and absences decreased.135
Training Methods
Historically, training meant “formal training,” planned in advance and follow￾ing a structured format. HR departments play a big role in this training. Formal 
training and development programs are still very much in use. Still, much of the 
workplace learning occurs in informal training—unstructured, unplanned, and 
easily adapted for situations and individuals. In reality, most informal training 
is nothing other than employees helping each other, sharing information, and 
solving work-related problems together. Regardless, both formal and informal 
training have important implications for how training is designed, structured, 
and implemented.
Instructional System Design The instructional system design (ISD) approach 
views training very formally and primarily centers on the role of the training 
developer and trainer in facilitating employee learning. The ISD approach gen￾erally follows the following procedure, also known as the ADDIE model:136
1. Analyze: Establish what skills, abilities, or other characteristics needs to be 
trained. Establish what goals should be accomplished by the training. Define 
who the trainees would be and what they would need to be successful.
2. Design: Establish what training success and failure would look like. Select 
instructional strategies to meet learning objectives and decide how trainees 
receive feedback on their performance.
3. Develop: Establish where training will occur and what will be needed (e.g., 
media, applications, other resources) to ensure its success.
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 605 13/12/22 3:21 AM606 PART 4 The Organization System
4. Implement: Engage trainees in the training session or program. Provide op￾portunities for transfer and encourage transfer following training.
5. Evaluation: Determine whether the system is successful in the context of the 
organization (e.g., how much money saved or gained, accidents avoided; 
how many people trained). Use the information to inform revisions of the 
training session or program.
Although ISD is an extremely useful organizing framework for designing and 
implementing formal training in organizations that enjoys widespread use,137 it 
is often criticized for falling short of focusing on the most important person in 
the training process: the trainee.138
Active Learning Addressing the limitations of the more instructor-oriented ISD 
model, active learning focuses primarily on the trainee or learner. Through 
encouraging trainees to actively engage and experiment with the training con￾tent, trainees can build confidence in their skills, abilities, and competencies, 
which will increase the likelihood of transfer.139 Active learning primarily con￾sists of three basic tenets: (1) encouraging exploration and reflection, (2) nor￾malizing errors and mistakes, and (3) controlling emotions. For example, an 
employee learning a new programming language may build some basic pro￾grams to accomplish basic tasks, learn from errors (or willfully commit them 
to see what would happen), and learn to manage the frustrations with making 
mistakes or not being an expert right away.140
Is active learning effective? Recent research on the method suggest that 
active learning is reacted to positively by trainees, leads to knowledge and skill 
acquisition, and also facilitates transfer performance.141 Why? It may be because 
trainee motivation plays a key role in training success, influencing whether 
trainees learn the material and apply it, as well as how trainees feel about it.142
As trainees become more actively engaged with the training content and move 
away from being passive recipients their learning increases.143
However, trainees may find it frustrating if they are given all of the materi￾als to learn and told to “get to it” without any direction. Many trainees benefit 
from working with other people (e.g., trainers or peers) who can offer feed￾back, guide them toward learning, support their incites, and offer explanations 
when necessary.144 Moreover, active learning appears to be more effective when 
used in moderation and for learning cognitive skills (rather than knowledge or 
facts).145 It also may not work for everyone—trainees who are motivated to learn 
the content will likely be more successful than those who just want to avoid fail￾ure or otherwise prove their worth (the sting of making mistakes or errors may 
be hard for them to handle).146
Interactive Learning Interactive learning builds upon active learning to sug￾gest that learning is a social construction created from interacting people (e.g., 
trainers–trainees, trainees–trainees).147 Therefore, training methods should 
create conditions not only in which the learner is actively engaging in training 
content, but doing so in a social context with other people.147 For instance, one 
study of thousands of students across eighteen high schools showed that posi￾tive teacher–student relationships mattered in facilitating student engagement 
with the content. If students have more negative than positive relationships with 
teachers, they tend to be less engaged with the content.149
Research in the workplace suggests that the relationships between people 
matter for training outcomes in organizations. For instance, one study of over 
ten thousand teachers found that the learner’s satisfaction with training was 
more attributable to the trainer than the course’s content.150 Moreover, trans￾fer of training is inevitably dependent upon the culture and climate of the 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 606 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 607
organization. If you attend ethics training but everyone in your workplace dis￾courages you from taking it seriously, rewards you for ignoring the training, or 
even ostracizes you for following through with what you learn, the skills you 
learn will not likely transfer. Therefore, interactive learning may be important 
as teams and units emerge from the training together on the same page. For 
example, research on city council workers participating in safety training are 
more likely to transfer if everyone—supervisors, coworkers, and safety profes￾sionals alike—take responsibility for what was learned.151 Training developers 
can encourage interactive participation even after training through collective 
group reflections and debriefs (e.g., after-action reviews [AARs]).152
E-Learning The fastest-growing training method is computer-based training, 
or e-training or e-learning.153 E-learning systems emphasize learner control 
over the pace and content of instruction, allow e-learners to interact through 
online communities, and incorporate other techniques such as simulations and 
group discussions.154 Therefore, e-learning approaches seek to emphasize the 
best elements of active and interactive learning in a boundless, electronic envi￾ronment.155 Computer-based training that lets learners actively participate in 
exercises and quizzes can be more effective than traditional classroom instruc￾tion.156 Employers can improve computer-based training by providing learners 
with regular prompts to set goals for learning, effective study strategies, and 
progress measurements toward the learning goals.157 Organizations are explor￾ing delivering e-training through microlessons, on-the-spot tips, and learning 
games on mobile devices.158
Evaluating Effectiveness
The effectiveness of a training program can refer to the level of trainee satisfac￾tion, the amount trainees learn, the extent to which they transfer the learned 
material to their jobs, and/or the company’s financial return on investments 
in training.159 These results are not always related. Some people who have a 
positive experience in an upbeat, fun class learn very little; some who learn a 
great deal have difficulty figuring out how to use their knowledge at work; and 
changes in employee behavior are sometimes not large enough to justify the 
expense of training. This means rigorous measurement of multiple training 
outcomes should be part of every training effort.
Is there general evidence related to training, development practices, and 
organizational performance? A variety of studies show that investments in 
on-the-job training lead to increases in productivity of significantly greater value 
than the cost of providing the training.160 Similarly, research indicated that cross￾cultural training was effective in raising performance when the training was done 
after the person was working in a new country but not when the training was 
conducted before departure to a new country.160 The climate for employee devel￾opment has also been related to business unit performance.161 For example, one 
study of 260 companies found that training expenditures were positively related 
to corporate innovation.163 Overall, most studies have shown that investments in 
training can indeed have positive effects at the aggregate level.
Performance Management
Performance management (also referred to as performance appraisal and per￾formance evaluation) is more often than not something designed and executed 
poorly in organizations. Too often managers conduct an annual performance 
appraisal that terrifies employees, provides them with little to no actionable 
17-5 List the methods 
of performance 
management.
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 607 13/12/22 3:21 AM608 PART 4 The Organization System
feedback, is informed by subjective impressions, and leaves everyone feeling 
tense, competitive, anxious, and worse off than if one was never conducted in 
the first place.164
The Internet is riddled with performance appraisal horror stories. For 
instance, one employee had a complaint attached to their appraisal from a year 
ago. The problem is that this employee never heard the complaint and did not 
even know what it was about. After inquiring with the supervisor, the supervisor 
said they did not record what it was and not to put too much stock in it because 
no one cared about what the complainant had to say anyway. But still, the super￾visor put it on the permanent record.165 As another example, many women 
report omnibus, sexist comments on their performance appraisals that have lit￾tle to do with their job performance. For instance, one employee encountered 
comments like “somebody said they didn’t like your facial expression” and “you 
need to be more direct” (followed with a “you need to be less direct” once the 
employee actually made changes).166 Indeed, a large body of research suggests 
that prejudicial stereotypes filter into performance evaluations.167
However, if done correctly, performance management can be a positive, 
developmental force in organizations. Performance management should be a 
continuous process where HR managers identify, measure, and develop both 
individual and team performance that is aligned with the strategic goals of 
the organization.168 In essence, performance management focuses on three 
primary areas (described in the introductory chapter): job performance, orga￾nizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and counterproductive work behavior 
(CWB). Most managers believe that good performance means doing well on 
the first two dimensions and avoiding the third.169 A person who does core job 
tasks very well but is rude and aggressive toward coworkers is not going to be 
considered a good employee in most organizations, and the most pleasant and 
upbeat worker who cannot do the main job tasks well is not going to be a good 
employee either. In this section we show how the choice of a performance evalu￾ation system and the way it is administered can influence employee behavior.
Performance evaluation serves a number of purposes. One is to help man￾agement make general human resources decisions about promotions, transfers, 
and terminations. Evaluations also identify training and development needs. They 
pinpoint employee skills and competencies for which remedial programs can be 
developed. Finally, they provide feedback to employees on how the organization 
views their performance and are often the basis for reward allocations, including 
merit pay increases.
What Do We Evaluate?
The criteria that management chooses to evaluate has a major influence on 
what employees do. The three most popular sets of criteria are individual task 
outcomes, behaviors, and traits.
Individual Task Outcomes Sometimes, management evaluates performance 
based on task outcomes, such as quantity produced, scrap generated, and cost 
per unit of production for a plant manager, or on overall sales volume in the 
territory, dollar increase in sales, and number of new accounts established for 
a salesperson. However, evaluating performance in this way can be incredibly 
unmotivating if there is a disconnect between employee behavior and task out￾comes or if task outcomes are governed by forces in the context beyond the 
employees’ control.
Recall expectancy theory from the chapter on motivation concepts—when there 
is a breakdown between effort and performance or between performance and out￾comes, motivation can decrease. For instance, imagine if you worked as a salesperson 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 608 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 609
for a company in Alaska that sold air-conditioning units. (In Anchorage, the average 
summer temperature ranges from 55 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit.)170 Many people in 
Alaska opt not to have air conditioners given the climate (although they probably 
have heating systems!). How would you feel if you were evaluated on how many air￾conditioning units you sold and not on your performance behaviors? Research sug￾gests that the context an individual or team operates in has major implications for its 
performance and how it fares in performance management systems.171
Behaviors It is difficult to attribute specific outcomes to the actions of employ￾ees in advisory or support positions whose work assignments are part of a group 
effort. We may readily evaluate the group’s performance but if it is hard to iden￾tify the contribution of each group member management will often evaluate the 
employee’s behavior. A manager might be evaluated on promptness in submit￾ting monthly reports or leadership style and a salesperson on average number 
of contact calls made per day or helpfulness toward other sales representatives.
Measured behaviors need not be limited to those directly related to individual 
productivity. Helping others, making suggestions for improvements, volunteer￾ing for extra duties, and other OCBs make work groups and organizations more 
effective and often are incorporated into evaluations of employee performance.
Traits Having a good attitude, showing confidence, being dependable, staying 
busy, or possessing a wealth of experience can be desirable in the workplace, but 
it is important to remember that these traits may not be highly correlated with 
positive task outcomes. Moreover, some personality traits may actively distort 
or upwardly manage supervisors’ perceptions of the employee. For instance, 
supervisors often rate employees on how well they take personal initiative or 
have proactive personality traits. However, research demonstrates that politically 
skilled employees are better able to recognize and capitalize on opportunities to 
“showcase” their initiative to their evaluating supervisors.172 Worse yet, they may 
not take the initiative or engage in proactive behaviors when their supervisor is 
not watching. Unfortunately, we cannot ignore the reality that organizations still 
use such traits to assess job performance.

Who Should Do the Evaluating?
Who should evaluate an employee’s performance? By tradition, the task has 
fallen to managers because they are held responsible for their employees’ per￾formance. But others may do the job better, particularly with the help of HR 
departments. With many of today’s organizations using self-managed teams, 
telecommuting, and other formats that distance bosses from employees, the 
immediate superior may not be the most reliable judge of an employee’s perfor￾mance. Peers and even subordinates are being asked to take part in the process 
and employees are participating in their own evaluations. As you might expect, 
self-evaluations often suffer from overinflated assessment and self-serving bias 
and they seldom agree with supervisor’s ratings.173 They are probably better 
suited to developmental than evaluative purposes.
In most situations, it is highly advisable to use multiple sources of ratings; any 
individual performance rating may say as much about the rater as about the per￾son being evaluated. By averaging across raters, we can obtain a more reliable, 
unbiased, and accurate performance evaluation. Another popular approach to 
performance evaluation is the use of 360-degree evaluations.174 These provide 
performance feedback from the employee’s full circle of daily contacts, from 
subordinates to customers, to bosses, to peers (see Exhibit 17-2). The number 
of appraisals can be as few as three or four or as many as 25; most organizations 
collect five to ten per employee.
What is the appeal of the 360-degree appraisal? By relying on feedback from 
people who know the employee well organizations hope to give everyone a 
sense of participation in the review process, increase employee accountability, 
and obtain more accurate readings on employee performance. Moreover, the 
context of each relationship matters for performance ratings—therefore, it is 
important to obtain ratings from multiple people who have worked with the 
target individual in a number of contexts and settings.175
However, evidence on its effectiveness is mixed.176 The 360-degree evalu￾ation provides employees with a wider perspective on their performance, but 
many organizations do not spend the time to train evaluators in giving con￾structive criticism. Some organizations allow employees to choose the peers and

subordinates who evaluate them, which can artificially inflate positive feedback. 
There is a risk of giving too much weight to people who do not know much 
about the employee’s actual performance. It is also difficult to reconcile dis￾agreements between rater groups. There is clear evidence that peers tend to 
give much more lenient ratings than supervisors or subordinates and also to 
make more errors in appraising performance. These evaluations may thus sup￾plement an understanding of the consistency of an employee but should not 
supplant objective evaluations of performance.
Methods of Performance Evaluation
We have discussed what we evaluate and who should do the evaluating. Now we 
ask: “How do we evaluate an employee’s performance? What are the specific 
techniques for evaluation?”
Written Comments Probably the simplest method is to write a narrative describing 
an employee’s strengths, weaknesses, past performance, potential, and suggestions 
for improvement. The written comment requires no complex forms or extensive 
training to complete. But a written appraisal may be determined as much by the 
evaluator’s writing skill as by the employee’s actual level of performance. It is also 
difficult to compare comments for different employees (or for the same employ￾ees written by different managers) without a standardized scoring key. However, 
advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning are enabling HR man￾agers to score these written comments quickly, easily, and accurately.177
Critical Incidents Critical incidents focus the evaluator’s attention on the dif￾ference between executing a job effectively and executing it ineffectively. The 
appraiser describes what the employee did that was especially effective or ineffec￾tive in a situation, citing only specific behaviors. A list of such critical incidents 
provide a rich set of examples to show the employee desirable behaviors that 
call for improvement. These critical incidents can thus serve as anchors defining 
what excellent performance and unsatisfactory performance looks like.
Graphic Rating Scales One of the oldest and most popular methods of evalua￾tion is the graphic rating scale. The evaluator goes through a set of performance 
factors—such as quantity and quality of work, depth of knowledge, cooperation, 
attendance, and initiative—and rates each on incremental scales. The scales 
may specify, say, five points, where job knowledge might be rated 1 (“is poorly 
informed about work duties”) to 5 (“has complete mastery of all phases of the 
job”). Although they do not provide the depth of information that comments 
or critical incidents do, graphic rating scales are less time consuming to develop 
and administer and they allow for quantitative analysis and comparison.
Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales Behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS)
combine major elements from the critical incident and graphic rating scale 
approaches. The appraiser rates employees on items along a continuum, but the 
items are examples of actual behavior on the job rather than general descrip￾tions or traits. To develop the BARS, participants first contribute specific illus￾trations of effective and ineffective behavior, which are translated into a set of 
performance dimensions with varying levels of quality.
Electronic Performance Monitoring (EPM) Some organizations utilize electronic 
performance monitoring (EPM) to capture objective indicators of employ￾ees’ performance while on the job. This captures attentional metrics, such as 
critical incidents A way of evaluating an 
employee’s behaviors that are key in making 
the difference between executing a job 
effectively and executing it ineffectively.

M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 611 13/12/22 3:21 AM612 PART 4 The Organization System
how long employees stay logged into collaboration programs (e.g., Microsoft 
Teams), how many reports they file, and whether they “cyberloaf” (e.g., visit￾ing shopping websites rather than working). Although many organizations use 
EPM for performance appraisal, they also may use EPM to protect against legal 
liability (e.g., ensure safety), to provide developmental feedback on how to per￾form better, or, sometimes, without clear direction (e.g., for purely authoritar￾ian purposes). In general, employees tend to react negatively to EPM, especially 
when it is real-time, not transparent (e.g., the employer is secretive), and inva￾sive (e.g., collects too much data without reason).177
Forced Comparisons Forced comparisons evaluate one individual’s perfor￾mance against the performance of another or others. It is a relative rather than 
an absolute assessment. The two most popular comparisons are group order 
ranking and individual ranking.
Group order ranking requires the evaluator to place employees into a par￾ticular classification such as the top one-fifth or the second one-fifth. If a rater 
has 20 employees, only four can be in the top fifth, so, of course, four must also 
be relegated to the bottom fifth. This method is often used in recommending 
students to graduate schools.
The individual ranking approach rank-orders employees from best to worst. 
If the manager is required to appraise 30 employees, the difference between 
the first and second employee is assumed to be the same as that between the 
twenty-first and twenty-second. Some employees may be closely grouped, but no 
ties are permitted. The result is a clear ordering from the highest performer to 
the lowest.
Not surprisingly, employees react negatively to relative performance evalu￾ations. Employees consider performance management systems to be much 
fairer when they are relative to how they have performed in the past, rather 
than how they are performing relative to their peers.179 One company that 
has been known to use these types of relative methods is Amazon. Past man￾agers at Amazon have described how they are directed to use group order 
ranking to determine how well their employees are faring across their entire 
team or division to determine HR systems and remedial plans (e.g., Amazon’s 
Focus initiative). Although some have described “hire to fire” practices, where 
managers hire people who they know they will eventually fire (by hiring peo￾ple they know they would rank in the bottom portion of the distribution), 
Amazon representatives deny this claim. Regardless, the managers who have 
come forward about these ranking practices describe immense amounts of 
pressure surrounding the practices, and the decisions are not easy, especially 
when everyone is a top performer. As one former manager noted, “Whomever 
is the least best has to go . . . it’s like firing someone who got an A- when the 
rest of the class got A’s.”180
Improving Performance Evaluations
The performance evaluation process is a potential minefield. Evaluators can 
unconsciously inflate evaluations (positive leniency), understate performance 
(negative leniency), or allow the assessment of one characteristic to unduly 
influence the assessment of others (the halo error). Some appraisers bias their 
evaluations by unconsciously favoring people who have qualities and traits 
similar to their own (the similarity error). For example, introverts may rate 
extroverts lower on performance. And some evaluators see the evaluation pro￾cess as a political opportunity to overtly reward or punish employees they like 
or dislike. One review on performance appraisals demonstrates that many man￾agers deliberately distort performance ratings in order to maintain a positive

relationship with their subordinates or to achieve a positive image of themselves 
by showing that all their employees are performing well.181 Although no protec￾tions guarantee accurate performance evaluations, the following suggestions can 
make the process more objective and fairer.
Use Multiple Evaluators As the number of evaluators increases, the probabil￾ity of attaining more accurate information increases, as does the likelihood 
that the employee will accept the feedback as valid.182 We often see multiple 
evaluators in competitions in sports such as diving and gymnastics. A set of 
evaluators judges a performance, the highest and lowest scores are dropped, 
and the final evaluation is made up of those remaining. The logic of multiple 
evaluators applies to organizations as well. If an employee has ten supervisors, 
of whom nine rated them as excellent and one poor, we can safely discount 
the one poor evaluation. By moving employees within the organization to 
gain a number of evaluations, or by using multiple assessors (as in 360-degree 
appraisals), we increase the probability of achieving more valid and reliable 
evaluations.
Evaluate Selectively To increase agreement among evaluations, appraisers 
should evaluate the areas of performance for which they have working knowl￾edge.183 Appraisers should thus be as close as possible, in organizational level, to 
the individual being evaluated. The more levels that separate the evaluator from 
the employee, the less opportunity the evaluator has to observe the individual’s 
behavior and therefore the greater the possibility for inaccuracies. Moreover, 
some research suggests that some evaluators have more of a firsthand oppor￾tunity to observe performance than others, especially employees who occupy a 
core position in the individual’s social network rather than a peripheral one.184
Train Evaluators If you cannot find good evaluators, make them. Training can 
produce more accurate raters.185 Most rater training courses emphasize chang￾ing the raters’ frame of reference by teaching them what to look for, so everyone 
in the organization defines good performance in the same way. Another effective 
training technique is to encourage raters to describe the employee’s behavior in 
as much detail as possible. Asking for more detail encourages raters to remem￾ber more about the employee’s performance rather than just acting on their 
feelings about the employee at the moment.
Provide Employees with Due Process The concept of due process can be applied to 
appraisals to increase the perception that employees are being treated fairly.186
Three features characterize due process systems: (1) Individuals are provided 
with adequate notice of what is expected of them, (2) all evidence relevant to 
a proposed violation is aired in a fair hearing so the individuals affected can 
respond, and (3) the final decision is based on the evidence and is free of bias. 
Research has demonstrated that employees who feel they are safe to contrib￾ute during a performance appraisal meeting and feel that their leader supports 
their contributions (and welcomes disagreements) leave the meetings feeling 
like it was a success.187
One technique that organizations might consider enhancing due pro￾cess is posting appraisals online so employees can see their own performance 
scores exactly as the supervisor enters them. One company that did so found 
employees believed rater accountability and employee participation were 
higher when appraisal information was available online prior to appraisal inter￾views.188 Maybe raters were more sensitive to providing accurate ratings when 
they knew employees would be able to see their own information directly.

 An Ethical Choice 
 Eliminating Bias from Performance Reviews 
Although performance evalu￾ations may be described as 
impartial measures of employee 
 performance, they are often far from 
objective. There are some startling 
disparities in performance evaluations 
that can be attributed to race and gen￾der. For example, only 9.5  percent of 
employees from underrepresented 
ethnic groups received references 
to leadership in their performance 
evaluations—more than 70  percent 
less than those used in White women’s 
performance evaluations. This dispar￾ity is significant because the mention 
of leadership skills in performance 
evaluations usually predicts higher 
competency ratings the following year. 
 More specifically, there are patterns 
of bias that have emerged over decades 
of research on performance evaluations. 
Employees from underrepresented 
groups tend to be judged based on their 
mistakes more frequently than their 
potential. Furthermore, they are more 
likely to have their personality traits 
mentioned in their evaluations (rather 
than what they actually did or did not 
do). The traits that are mentioned are 
more often negative than positive. 
 The good news is that several inter￾ventions or so-called “bias interrupt￾ers” can be employed to effectively 
reduce bias in performance reviews. 
Two simple ones are outlined below: 
1. Use an evaluation form that includes 
specific competencies on which the 
employee will be evaluated. The rat￾ings for each of these should be 
supported by at least three pieces 
of evidence. Open-ended ques￾tions should be avoided if possible 
because without the structure of 
specific criteria, as many studies 
have shown, individuals are more 
likely to rely upon stereotypes when 
making decisions. 
2. Develop a workshop to teach indi￾viduals how to effectively implement 
the form. As part of the workshop, 
elicit comments from the previous 
year’s evaluations and ask whether 
patterns of bias are represented in 
the comments. 
 Although employers may intend to 
be as meritocratic as possible when 
utilizing performance evaluations, 
assessments are often not perfect and 
can be vulnerable to implicit biases. 
Thus, each year, thoroughly auditing 
performance reviews is necessary and 
can help organizations develop work￾places that are more equitable and 
inclusive. 189
 Providing Performance Feedback 
 Few activities are more unpleasant for many managers than providing perfor￾mance feedback to employees. In fact, unless pressured by organizational poli￾cies and controls, managers are likely to ignore this responsibility. Why? 
 First, even though almost every employee could stand to improve in some 
areas, managers fear confrontation when presenting negative feedback. Second, 
many employees do tend to become defensive when their weaknesses are 
pointed out. Instead of accepting the feedback as constructive and a basis for 
improving performance, some criticize the manager or redirect blame to some￾one else. As a side note, managers are not immune to this either— managers 
become cynical and defensive when presented with multi-source feedback in 
their own performance appraisals and are more likely to leave as a result (espe￾cially when under pressure and with few resources). 190 Third, managers tend to 
have inflated perceptions of how employees perceive their feedback as well as 
the accuracy of their own feedback, and therefore deliver feedback ineffectively. 
Managers should not make assumptions regarding how employees feel or may 
interpret the feedback. 191 Finally, employees tend to have an inflated assess￾ment of their own performance. But the average employee’s estimate of their 
own performance level is generally much higher than it is in reality. 
 The solution to the problem is not to ignore it but to train managers to con￾duct constructive feedback sessions. An effective review—in which the employee 
perceives the appraisal as fair, the manager as sincere and empathetic, and 
the climate as constructive—can leave the employee feeling upbeat, informed 
about areas needing improvement, and determined to correct them. 192 This is 
a perfect outcome if the evaluation is fair and thorough, but unfortunately an 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 614 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 615
employee may feel this way in situations where the evaluator feels an interde￾pendence with the employee and therefore is more lenient in the evaluation. 193
 It probably would not surprise you that employees in a bad mood are much 
less likely to take advice than employees in a good mood. 194 Appraisals should 
also be as specific as possible. People are most likely to overrate their own per￾formance when asked about overall job performance, but they can be more 
objective when feedback is about a specific area. 195 It is also hard to figure out 
how to improve your performance globally—it is much easier to improve in 
specific areas. The performance review should be a counseling activity more 
than a judgment process, best accomplished by allowing it to evolve from the 
employee’s self-evaluation. 
 Myth or Science? The 24-Hour Workplace Is Harmful 
 T his statement appears to be true 
in many cases. Although technol￾ogy makes it possible for employ￾ees to be plugged in all the time, in 
constant contact around the globe, 
research suggests that employers 
who push employees to check in at all 
hours and stay connected may well be 
doing themselves (and their employ￾ees) a disservice. 
 A growing body of research has 
uncovered serious health conse￾quences of insufficient sleep, and work 
practices that encourage employees 
to be plugged in 24 hours a day may 
be making the situation worse. One 
study examined how late-night work 
influenced job outcomes by having 
employees complete diary surveys on 
their sleep and engagement at work 
over multiple days. Those who used 
smartphones at night for work were 
less engaged in their work tasks the 
next day, even after accounting for 
other technology use. 
 From another angle, researchers 
have looked at the personal conse￾quences of workaholism, which is the 
tendency to think constantly about 
work off the job and to feel compelled 
to work excessive hours. This habit is 
associated with higher levels of burn￾out, stress, and family problems. While 
workaholism is partially driven by per￾sonality factors, surveys suggest that 
features of the workplace itself can 
enhance workaholic tendencies, includ￾ing excessive workloads, conflicting 
work priorities, and time pressures. 
Workaholics may not immediately per￾ceive these effects because they are 
often highly committed to their work 
and enjoy it in the short term, until 
burnout occurs. 
 The key to maintaining performance 
over time may lie in developing psy￾chological detachment from work. 
Alongside studies showing the nega￾tive effects of overexposure to work 
demands we can place another body of 
work showing that short regular breaks 
made up of total rest and avoidance of 
work responsibilities can recharge a 
person’s energy. Unplugging from con￾stant work demands for short periods 
actually makes us much more produc￾tive over the long haul. Therefore, the 
evidence is clear: Unplug to recharge 
yourself. HR can support this effort 
by presenting the research findings 
to managers and helping to establish 
practices and boundaries that benefit 
everyone. 196
 Accessible Workplaces 
 Workplace policies, both official and circumstantial, regarding individuals with 
physical or mental disabilities vary from country to country but matter for all HR 
processes, including recruitment, selection, training, and performance manage￾ment. 197 Countries such as Canada, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Syria, and 
Mali have specific laws to protect individuals with disabilities. 198 These laws have 
resulted in greater acceptance and accommodation of people with physical or 
mental disabilities. In the United States, for instance, the representation of indi￾viduals with disabilities in the workforce rapidly increased with the passage of the 
ADA in 1990. 199 According to the ADA, employers are required to make reason￾able accommodations so their workplaces will be accessible to individuals with 
physical or mental disabilities. 200 Examples of recognized disabilities include

accommodations make 
accessible workplaces. 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 615 13/12/22 3:21 AM616 PART 4 The Organization System
missing limbs, seizure disorder, Down syndrome, deafness, schizophrenia, alco￾holism, diabetes, depression, and chronic back pain. These conditions share 
almost no common features, so there is no specific definition about how each 
condition is related to employment.
Accommodations for Physical Disabilities
The EEOC classifies a person as having a disability who has any physical or men￾tal disability that substantially limits one or more major life activities. The impact 
of disabilities on employment outcomes has been explored from a variety of per￾spectives. On one hand, when disability status is randomly manipulated among 
hypothetical candidates, individuals with a disability are rated as having superior 
personal qualities like dependability.201 Another review suggested that workers 
with disabilities receive higher performance evaluations. However, individuals with 
disabilities tend to encounter lower performance expectations and are less likely 
to be hired.202
Discrimination against the workforce of those individuals with disabilities 
has long been problematic (see the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in 
organizations for an in-depth discussion on discrimination and prejudice).203 In 
Europe, for instance, policies to motivate employers have often failed to boost 
the workforce participation rate for workers with disabilities, and outright quota 
systems in Germany, France, and Poland have backfired.204 However, the recog￾nition of the talents and abilities of individuals with disabilities has made a posi￾tive impact. In addition, technology and workplace advancements have greatly 
increased the scope of available jobs for those with all types of disabilities.
Managers need to be attuned to the true requirements of each job and 
match the skills of the individual to them, providing accommodations when 
needed. And the accommodation process should not be a merely transactional 
determination—research from nearly twenty thousand German federal employ￾ees found that supervisors and subordinates with physical disabilities can work 
together to establish accommodations that work for everyone involved (and 
reduce the likelihood of turnover among employees).205
Accommodations for Hidden Disabilities
As we mentioned earlier, disabilities include observable characteristics like 
missing limbs, illnesses that require a person to use a wheelchair, and blindness. 
Other disabilities may not be directly observable. Unless an individual decides 
to disclose a disability that is not easily observable, it can remain hidden at 
the discretion of the employee. These are called hidden disabilities (or invisible 
disabilities). Hidden disabilities generally fall under the categories of sensory 
disabilities (for example, being hard of hearing), autoimmune disorders (like 
rheumatoid arthritis), chronic illness or pain (like carpal tunnel syndrome), 
cognitive or learning disabilities (like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
[ADHD]), sleep disorders (like insomnia), and psychological challenges (like 
PTSD).205 Mental disabilities may affect performance more than physical dis￾abilities: Individuals with common mental health issues such as depression and 
anxiety are significantly more likely to be absent from work.207
As a result of changes to the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments 
Act (ADAAA) of 2008, U.S. organizations must accommodate employees with a 
broad range of disabilities. However, employees must disclose their conditions 
to their employers in order to be eligible for workplace accommodations and 
employment protection. Many employees do not want to disclose their invis￾ible disabilities, so they are prevented from getting the workplace accommoda￾tions they need in order to thrive in their jobs. Research indicates that individu￾als with hidden disabilities are afraid of being stigmatized or ostracized if they 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 616 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 617
disclose their disabilities to others in the workplace, and they believe that their 
managers will think they are less capable of strong job performance.208 Add 
this to the challenge of receiving a diagnosis for a condition that one did not 
previously have, and these fears are compounded even more so than if the diag￾nosis was made for employees when they were younger.209
In some ways, a hidden disability is not truly invisible. For example, a person 
with an undisclosed diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will still exhibit 
the behaviors characteristic of the condition, such as difficulty with verbal com￾munication and lack of adaptability.210 You may observe behaviors that lead you 
to suspect an individual has a hidden disability. Unfortunately, you may attribute 
the behavior to other causes—for instance, you may incorrectly ascribe the slow, 
slurred speech of a coworker to an alcohol dependency rather than to the long￾term effects of a stroke.
As for the employee, research suggests that disclosure generally helps all—
the individual, others, and organizations. Disclosure may increase the job satis￾faction and well-being of the individual, help others understand and assist the 
individual to succeed in the workplace, and allow the organization to accom￾modate the situation so that the employee and the organization achieve top 
performance.211 Moreover, following disclosure, managers and employees alike 
should put in the work to learn more about the physical or mental disability (so 
they do not make unfounded assumptions)212 and do what they can to develop 
an environment that is accommodating, inclusive, and equitable.213
Human Resources (HR) Leadership
We have discussed the important functions HR departments serve in recruitment, 
selection, training and development, performance management, and accommo￾dations for disability. Arguably, these are an organization’s most important tasks 
in managing its most valuable asset—its people. However, HR also plays a key 
leadership role in nearly all aspects of the workplace environment. HR is active in 
designing and administering benefits programs, to conducting attitude surveys, 
to drafting and enforcing employment policies. HR is on the frontlines in manag￾ing adversarial employment conditions such as work–life conflicts, mediations, 
terminations, and layoffs. It is on the scene when an employee joins and leaves 
and all along the way. HR departments uniquely represent both the employees’ 
and the company’s perspectives as needed, so we will discuss the importance of 
HR communication before each of the facets of HR leadership.
Companies have only recently begun to recognize the potential for HR to 
influence employee performance. Researchers have been examining the effects 
of a high-performance work system (HPWS), a group of human resources prac￾tices that some organizations have been implementing.214 These practices work 
together and reinforce one another to accomplish the organization’s strat￾egy and improve organizational outcomes over time.215 HPWS may increase 
organizational performance, but higher organizational performance may 
also reinforce high-performance practices by providing more resources to an 
HPWS. HPWS may also have more of an effect on organizational performance 
when leadership is not oriented toward organizational goals (e.g., improving 
customer service).216 HPWS practices can include those that enhance moti￾vation, such as profit sharing programs and other reward systems, as well as 
practices that improve skills, such as training and development programs.217
Creativity-oriented HPWS inspire employees to come up with innovative solu￾tions that meet diverse customer needs.217 Lastly, empowerment-oriented 
HPWS empower employees to speak up and autonomously take charge of their 
work, leading to improved job performance.219

 Toward a Better World 
 Kawasaki: Learning from Each Other 
at Takumi Juku and Manabiya 
 Kawasaki Heavy Industries is a 
major public manufacturer of heavy 
equipment (e.g., robots, gas tur￾bines, boilers), vehicles, and ships. 
Headquartered in Kobe, Japan, 
Kawasaki is one of the major Japanese 
manufacturing companies, alongside 
Mitsubishi. Throughout the last decade, 
Kawasaki has endeavored to make the 
environment, sustainability, and gov￾ernance (ESG) a core part of its strat￾egy. Moreover, it has sought to align its 
HR strategies and operations with its 
ESG goals and with its corporate mis￾sion to build a sustainability-focused 
 high-performance work system (HPWS). 
One of Kawasaki’s key ESG values is 
“support for the next generation,” and 
Kawasaki realizes this value through 
many HR programs. 
 How does Kawasaki foster this 
sense of shared mission and goals 
within an HR system? First, Kawasaki 
has implemented the Gyomu Mokuhya 
Kyoyuka (“Sharing Business Targets”) 
program, intended to create bi-annual 
supervisor–subordinate meetings to 
track performance, identity training 
and growth needs, and foster a shared 
acceptance of goals. For technical 
specialists, this also involves improv￾ing front-line production skills through 
an apprenticeship program that pairs 
“grand master” specialists (who have 
been credentialed as extremely skilled 
in their trade) with newer employees. 
Second, Kawasaki holds an annual 
technical skills contest for younger 
employees to demonstrate the tal￾ents they learned at their worksites. 
These newer employees from Japan 
and other countries worldwide gather 
at the Akashi Works, a major manufac￾turing plant, to take part in these con￾tests to develop their skills and learn 
from one another. Finally, Kawasaki 
has opened to corporate campuses for 
technicians to pass down their skills 
and learn collaboratively. The Takumi 
Juki at the Harima Works plant, as 
well as the Manabiya at the Akashi 
Works plant, create formal centers for 
employees to learn from one another. 
 Kawasaki’s reach to create a col￾laborative culture that learns from 
one another does not stop there. 
Apart from facilitating training and 
skill transfer amongst its employees, 
it also develops knowledge, skills, 
and engagement among young people 
worldwide. First, Kawasaki has cre￾ated a corporate museum to teach 
young people and other community 
members about technology and crafts￾manship. This museum, or Kawasaki 
Good Times World, sees nearly two 
hundred thousand visitors annually 
and provides people with an opportu￾nity to interact with and learn about 
how motorcycles, robots, and other 
machines across land, sea, and air 
are made. Second, Kawasaki hosts 
Handicraft and Experiment Courses 
for children to learn how to make their 
own technology-oriented products. 
Employees from every business unit 
develop and deliver these training pro￾grams to children from the community, 
who have an opportunity to actively 
participate in building toy helicopters, 
cranes, motorcycles, trains, ships, 
and even toy jet engines and power 
plants. The Handicraft and Experiment 
Courses program has won several 
awards at the Education Support 
Project Grand Prix. Finally, the Akashi 
Works and Manabiya campus are stra￾tegically located next to Hanazono 
Kindergarten, Kisaki Elementary School, 
and Bokai Junior High School. Every 
year, parents and students from these 
schools are invited to take field trips 
to the Akashi Works to tour the facili￾ties, learn about the manufacturing 
process, and have lunch with Kawasaki 
employees. 
 Why should organizations like 
Kawasaki seek to involve HR in the pur￾suit of ESG goals? Research by Marsh 
& McLennan concludes that ESG has a 
major impact on workforce sentiment 
(which can be a competitive advantage). 
It is becoming increasingly important to 
the recruitment, selection, and reten￾tion of employees. Moreover, a survey 
of 170 board directors worldwide con￾ducted by Willis Towers Watson sug￾gests that performance management 
systems should play a role in meeting 
ESG goals, aligning them with perfor￾mance evaluation and incentives. HR 
and leadership have a way of “super￾charging” ESG efforts. With executive 
support and communication of ESG 
goals and policies all employees can 
become involved and educated about 
the company’s ESG effort. Kawasaki’s 
ESG initiatives may be playing a role 
here, as it boasts a less than 2  per￾cent annual turnover rate with over 
two-thirds of the workforce expressing 
interest in continued employment with 
Kawasaki. 220
 Communicating HR Practices 
 Leadership by HR begins with informing employees about HR practices and 
explaining the implications of decisions that might be made around these prac￾tices. It is not enough simply to have a practice in place; HR needs to let employ￾ees know about it. When a company successfully communicates how the whole 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 618 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 619
system of HR practices has been developed and what function this system serves, 
employees feel they can control and manage what they get out of work.221 We 
have noted in other chapters that knowing you can influence the outcomes of 
your work is highly motivational. Employees can come to see the HR philosophy 
and system as an employer’s expression of concern, and the positive feelings that 
result have been shown to not only affect the adoption of the HPWS by employ￾ees222 but also increase employee commitment, retention, and engagement.219
The evidence supporting the contribution of communication and perception 
to HR effectiveness is considerable (with some research suggesting leadership 
is the most valuable component).224 For example, one study of different busi￾ness units within a large food-service organization found that employee percep￾tions of HR practices, rated at the work-group level, were significant predictors 
of OCB, commitment, and intention to remain with the company,225 but the 
HR practices led to these positive outcomes only if employees were aware they 
were in place. Other studies have found that HR practices have different effects 
depending on how employees perceive the reason for them.226 Employees who 
think HR practices are established to improve performance and benefit workers 
reciprocate with greater commitment and performance. Employees who think 
these same practices are established to exploit workers do not have the same 
positive reactions.
The effectiveness of HR practices also depends on employee attitudes. One 
review found that HR practices were more likely to lead to positive outcomes 
when employees felt motivated.227 Other research indicated that employees 
who were more knowledgeable about the purpose of a performance manage￾ment system used the system more effectively to improve their efficiency and 
thoroughness.228 Taken together, these results suggest that it is not enough for 
employers simply to set up practices—they need to show that the practices are 
actually attempts to make the company more successful and help employees 
achieve better outcomes. Leadership communication can help shape employee 
attitudes and perceptions about HR practices.
Drafting and Enforcing Employment Policies
Along with benefits come responsibilities and employees need to know what 
the organization expects from them. Employment policies that are informed by 
current laws but go beyond minimum requirements will help define a positive 
organizational culture and climates (see the chapter on culture and change). 
Policies differ from benefits (see the chapter on motivation application) in 
that they provide the guidelines for behavior, not just the working conditions. 
A company might provide the benefit of a special break room for mothers of 
young children, but a policy is needed to outline the expectation for conduct. 
May mothers elect to feed their babies in other places in the facility or only in 
the break room? What timing is acceptable? Where can collected breast milk be 
stored? Establishing policies to address potential questions can help minimize 
confusion for all employees. The lactation case is an example of a potential ben￾efit and policy combination that will ensure employees recognize the benefit as 
an employer’s aid to their well-being while understanding how and where to use 
it. However, any policy must have enforcement to be effective. HR managers are 
responsible for setting the organizational consequences of infractions and often 
for enforcing policies as well.
Sometimes, HR managers need to act even when the employee’s direct man￾ager may not agree, especially if compliance with the law is at issue. For example, 
many companies in the entertainment, nonprofit, publishing, and marketing 
industries use unpaid post-college interns, who are supposed to receive on-the￾job experience as compensation. The Labor Department stipulates that interns 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 619 13/12/22 3:21 AM620 PART 4 The Organization System
who are unpaid must be provided a vocational education experience and that 
their work cannot profit the employer. Interns report getting stuck doing menial 
tasks an employer would need to pay someone else to do. If these companies 
want to continue using unpaid interns, HR managers need to set policies that 
clarify the assignments the supervisors can give and then ensure that the poli￾cies are followed. Otherwise, their organizations will face lawsuits like the one 
from Eric Glatt, an intern on the movie Black Swan, who sued for minimum 
wage violations. A judge in the U.S. District Court ruled that he was improperly 
cataloged as an intern. The decision cited criteria from the Labor Department 
wherein an unpaid internship must provide work similar to training the person 
would receive in a school, benefit the intern not the employer, and not displace 
other employees. This ruling sparked similar claims against NBC Universal, 
Fox, Viacom, and other large organizations, often ending in out-of-court settle￾ments. The issue is far from conclusive, however, leaving the burden on interns 
to litigate if they are unfairly treated.
In conclusion, the role of leadership in HR is imperative to create positive 
cultures and climates that meet organizational objectives, realize desired busi￾ness outcomes, and remain competitive in the marketplace as high-performing 
work systems.
Summary
An organization’s HR systems and practices create important forces that greatly 
influence OB and important work outcomes. HR departments have become in￾creasingly integral in shaping the composition of the organization’s workforce. 
First, HR departments have taken the lead in establishing an online presence to 
attract job seekers to learn about their organization to further their recruitment 
efforts, build relationships with job seekers through recruiters, and provide a 
window into a day in the life of employees through realistic job previews. Second, 
HR departments are involved in all phases of selection: initial selection, substan￾tive selection, and contingent selection, with the ultimate goal of hiring the best 
candidates who contribute to the organization’s human capital resources and 
who are poised to advance the mission and objectives of the organization. In 
effective organizations HR remains actively involved throughout an employee’s 
time with the organization. HR departments create and administer training and 
development programs. In many companies, HR provides continuous, active 
learning opportunities for their employees to stay engaged and grow as mem￾bers of the organization. They also set policies and practices that govern the 
performance evaluation system. Although many companies have not fully mas￾tered performance management yet, it can be a great HR tool if implemented 
frequently and with the goal of being developmental, not punitive. Finally, HR is 
an important function for building diverse and inclusive workplaces, especially 
for employees with physical and mental disabilities. HR works with employees 
to establish reasonable accommodations to build inclusive and accommodat￾ing workplaces. Overall, HR serves in a leadership capacity with responsibili￾ties that include drafting, communicating, and enforcing employment policies 
and practices regularly. HR should bring awareness of ethical issues to all stages 
of an individual’s experience with the organization. Therefore, knowledgeable 
HR professionals are a great resource to all levels of the organization, from top 
management to employees.

Implications for Managers
● Managers should increase applicant attraction by managing their impres￾sions with potential job seekers. To do so, recruiters should be trained to 
build positive relationships with job seekers; the recruitment and selec￾tion systems should be fair, just, and clear; and the company brand should 
communicate its core values and safeguard its reputation.
● Although referral hiring is an extremely common practice, there is mixed 
evidence for whether it is effective. In some ways, it can enrich workplace 
relationships—in other ways, job seekers and current employees may see 
the practice as unfair.
● Realistic job previews are one way to manage job seekers and applicant 
expectations of what it is like to work at a company. The realistic job pre￾view is becoming increasingly accessible to managers. Many companies 
post realistic job preview videos, simulations, and games on their websites.
● The hiring process is extremely complex, and managers should care￾fully consider the methods they use in initial, substantive, and contingent 
selection. Above all, managers should make sure that each piece of the 
selection puzzle positively contributes to the decision, does not introduce 
bias, complies with laws and regulations, and does not treat people from 
underrepresented groups unfairly. Moreover, some of the most common 
methods (e.g., unstructured interviews, applications, cover letters) are the 
least informative.
● Managers should build systems that keep track of training needs and skills 
gaps, design (online and in-person) programs that meet these needs, and 
continuously evaluate their effectiveness. Formal and informal training 
have their place, and managers should take a three-pronged approach 
that focuses on building structure, fostering trainee engagement, and 
nurturing positive learning interactions between people.
● Performance management is done poorly more often than not. Managers 
should consider ditching the traditional approach of annual perfor￾mance appraisals for termination, promotion, and pay increase decisions. 
Instead, managers could develop performance management systems that 
are conducted continuously, focus on concrete behaviors, obtain feed￾back from multiple trained employees well acquainted with the target in￾dividual, and serve developmental purposes (e.g., providing feedback that 
identifies professional growth and development gaps).
● Managers are required to provide reasonable accommodation for dis￾closed, recognized disabilities under the ADA. Beyond this, however, 
managers should actively work with employees with disabilities to consider 
their needs, learn more about their disabilities so that they can better 
understand their situations, and foster an inclusive and accommodating 
environment.
● Leadership plays a critical role in establishing, communicating, and 
enforcing high-performance work practices. With executive and manager 
support and championing, many organizational initiatives could fall flat.

 Employers Should Check Applicants’ Criminal Backgrounds 
POINT 
Depending on where you live, you may have been asked about 
your criminal arrest record on a job application. Even if you 
were not asked outright, the company might have investigated 
anyway using a background check service. Surveys suggest that nearly 
70 percent of companies do some sort of criminal background check 
on job applicants. When so many are using the same basic strategy, 
they likely have a good reason. 
 Companies check criminal records for many purposes. Some 
managers believe that prior criminal behavior may be an indicator of 
future criminal behavior. Many employees have used the access and 
privileges of their jobs to commit crimes, ranging from theft to assault 
or even murder. A check of their criminal records may help screen out 
these individuals. 
 As Lucia Bone, founder of the nonprofit Sue Weaver Cause, says, 
“It is the employer’s responsibility to protect . . . their business, their 
employees, and their customers.” This is a deeply meaningful issue for 
Bone. She founded the organization and named it after her sister, Sue 
Weaver, murdered by a man with a criminal record who had access 
to her home to clean air ducts. Many hiring managers check criminal 
backgrounds specifically because they do not want their own lack of 
diligence to lead to similarly tragic outcomes. 
 Besides signaling an immediate risk of criminal activity on the job, 
criminal records may be good behavioral indicators of other deviant 
workplace behavior. People who are willing to violate social conven￾tions in one area may likely violate them in others. When employers 
screen for the use of illegal drugs or shoplifting arrests, they are trying 
to identify people who might lie to supervisors or embezzle money. 
Information gathered from criminal records is likely to be more objec￾tive and accurate than a manager’s gut feelings about who will pose 
a problem in the future. 
COUNTERPOINT 
According to sociologist Devah Pager, the high U.S. incarcera￾tion rate means employers’ hiring decisions have major labor 
market and social implications if based on criminal records. 
Koch Industries has stopped asking applicants about criminal records. 
CEO Charles Koch notes, “If ex-offenders can’t get a job, education, or 
housing, how can we possibly expect them to have a productive life?” 
Koch’s concern is valid. One study linked a young-adult arrest record 
to lower incomes and education levels later in life and a conviction 
record to lower levels. 
 There are also substantial racial and ethnic group differences in 
arrest rates. Men are much more likely to have arrest and conviction 
records than women. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC) concludes that excluding individuals with criminal records 
from jobs effectively discriminates against Black men in particular. 
 Criminal background checks do not necessarily give employers 
the information they seek. A core principle of modern criminal jus￾tice holds that we all are innocent until proven guilty. However, some 
screens will turn up both conviction and arrest records. This is prob￾lematic because fewer than half of arrests end in conviction. While the 
use of arrest records is prohibited in many localities, that is far from 
a universal rule. Other investigations have found that online criminal 
records checks are prone to false positives, reporting that someone 
has a criminal past when they do not. 
 Another problem is the lack of relevance. While many would agree 
that a person convicted of assault is not a good candidate for work 
that requires carrying a weapon or associating with vulnerable popu￾lations, it is less clear how a petty-theft conviction might raise the 
same concerns. Sociologist Christopher Uggen summarizes by observ￾ing, “We haven’t really figured out what a disqualifying offense should 
be for particular activities.” 229

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
HR policies and practices have a tremendous influ￾ence on the success of an organization. Recruitment 
and selection enable organizations to increase their 
human capital resources. Training can also strengthen 
the abilities and skills of employees that drive organi￾zational performance. HR practices and policies also 
determine how performance is measured, the inclu￾siveness and accessibility of the workplace, and other 
factors that influence many important organizational 
outcomes. In this chapter, you helped develop many 
skills that are useful in the workplace. You developed 
your critical thinking and creativity, social responsibil￾ity, leadership, and career management skills by un￾covering the role high-performance demands play in 
crafting harmful “24-hour” workplaces, determining 
how to remove bias from performance reviews, debat￾ing whether employers should conduct criminal back￾ground checks, and discovering how Kawasaki meets its 
sustainability goal of “supporting the next generation,” 
both internally and externally. In the next section, you 
will continue to build these skills by designing an as￾sessment center exercise, deciding whether to hire a 
friend, and facing the travesty of human trafficking in 
the United States.
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Designing a Virtual Assessment Center Exercise
In this exercise, you will focus on creating a performance￾simulation test for selecting a new head of character 
design at a digital animation studio. The position 
is completely virtual. Candidates are being assessed 
worldwide. To assess candidates from so many varied 
geographical areas, the hiring manager wants to use 
an assessment center to select the new employee. As 
you learned in the chapter, assessment center exercises 
are meant to simulate problems that employees may 
encounter on the job. Because assessment centers are 
conducted offsite, employers can create virtual assess￾ment centers that candidates can take part in on their 
computers. For example, candidates for a management 
position may be asked to sign into a website to access 
a virtual e-mail inbox. Responses sent through this vir￾tual inbox can then assess how a candidate responds to 
e-mails or memos over a set time period.
A couple of details are unique about the position. 
Unlike many other positions that may be selected 
using assessment centers, the head of character design 
should be very creative, technically proficient, and ar￾tistic. A competitive candidate should be a great artist 
but also good at managing other artists. More typical 
assessment center exercises would not be suitable for 
this position.
Step 1: Form groups of two or three people each. To start 
the exercise, consider the common tasks some￾one in this position would encounter. What would 
managing other artists entail? It may be helpful 
to look up job descriptions for creative directors, 
head animators, and character designers at large 
firms like Pixar and DreamWorks. List five to ten 
essential tasks for someone in this position.
Step 2: Next, pick a task that can be simulated in a vir￾tual assessment center. As a group, write a brief 
description of the task. Make sure to consider 
the following: the objective of the task, what in￾structions the candidates would receive, and how 
much time the candidates would have to com￾plete the task.
Step 3: When you have created your assessment cen￾ter exercise, consider how to score applicants’ 
work. First, to create a good rubric for scoring, 
decide what results would reflect good or poor 
performance. Next, decide what traits would be 
needed to be successful during this exercise. 
Each trait should be measured by something 
that can be seen while the person is completing 
the task or accessing the task results. Create a 
rating scale to assess candidates on your assess￾ment center exercise.
After all the groups have designed the assessment cen￾ter exercise and rating scale, as a class, discuss what each 
group did.

determine if a candidate had all the traits needed 
to complete the job?

virtual rather than in-person assessment center? 
Would using another means of selecting candidates 
(structured interview, work sample) be easier?
ETHICAL DILEMMA Should I Pay the Staff More and Reduce the Company’s Profit?
Ryanair has radically changed the travel habits of 
European citizens over the last decade, with 131 million 
customers in 2017 alone. Popular among millennials 
especially for its cheap fares, Ryanair faced an unexpected 
crisis in the fall of 2017 with more than 20,000 cancelled 
flights and 700,000 passengers who had to be refunded 
or diverted to other flights. The problem was due to a 
staffing crisis, with a high number of pilots deciding to 
quit the company after having been offered higher com￾pensation and better working conditions by Ryanair’s 
competitors. 
In an extreme attempt to remedy the pilot roster crisis, 
CEO Michael O’Leary wrote a letter promising a loyalty 
bonus to those pilots who would remain with the com￾pany and agree to fly additional hours during their time 
off. The letter was an attempt to show more gratitude to 
pilots and give an indirectly reply to unions that, in the 
months leading up to the crisis, had denounced Ryanair’s 
employment model, which was characterized by a system￾atic use of external contractors and self-employed pilots 
who are hired through external agencies. These pilots do 
not receive compensation for non-flight hours and are 
not entitled to vacation, sickness, or paid leave.
Regardless of the specific circumstances of Ryanair’s 
case, this story brings to light a highly debated question 
in human resource management. Should the workforce 
be paid more at expense of company’s profit? Should 
personnel be treated in a better fashion with greater 
provision of benefits programs? Many would likely say 
yes, but the answer to this question is not as straightfor￾ward as it seems. Many employers would like to pay their 
staff more and promote them more often, but there 
are several constraints, including global competition 
and customers who might not be keen to pay more for 
products or services whose prices are justified by better 
employment conditions. Yet, as the case demonstrates, 
there are some drawbacks to failing to treat well those 
who could cause severe damage to the company’s repu￾tation and regular functioning.230
Questions
17-12. How might Ryanair’s CEO convince pilots to 
remain loyal to the company? Would monetary 
incentives be sufficient?
17-13. Is it appropriate to write pilots a letter to prom￾ise a bonus for accepting to fly more hours dur￾ing time off? What could Ryanair do differently 
to better communicate their HR practices?
17-14. Does more sustainable management of the 
workforce impose costs or generate benefits for 
companies? 
CASE INCIDENT Fired via Video Message
How would you feel if you were fired from your job with￾out any warning and via a 3-minute pre-recorded Zoom 
video? This is what 800 employees of P&O Ferries, one 
of the largest British shipping companies, experienced 
in Spring 2022. P&O Ferries operates ferries from the 
United Kingdom to Continental Europe and Ireland 
and is owned by a Dubai-based logistics company. Like 
so many other companies in the transportation sector, 
P&O Ferries was hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis and 
lost millions of pounds. The decision to lay off 800 sea￾farers was claimed as a necessary part of the CEO’s at￾tempt to restructure its operations and the only way to 
save the business from going under.
However, the company’s drastic decision came as a 
complete surprise to its employees, as the company had 
not gone through the due process of consulting them 
or the worker’s union before carrying out the mass 
job cuts, as is required by the UK law. Employment 
laws vary in different countries; for example, in the 
United States, law consultation and notice rights are 
somewhat limited, while in countries like India and 
Japan, neither collective nor individual consultation is 
required. In the United Kingdom, on the other hand, 
a company’s HR department should be aware that 
such a process is mandated by the UK employment 
law. If the due process is not followed, such decisions 
can be challenged by the employment tribunal. The 
CEO’s failure to take HR input in this decision meant 
that the company would later be found in breach of 
the law. 
M17_ROBB0025_19_GE_C17.indd 624 13/12/22 3:21 AMHuman Resource Systems and Practices CHAPTER ­1 625
Furthermore, the very way in which redundancy de￾cisions were communicated to the employees lacked 
proper processes and procedures. The 3-minute pre￾recorded Zoom video meeting took place at the end of 
the day, without any warning. The call simply informed 
seafarers that their job no longer existed, and following 
the announcement, they were escorted off the vessels in 
which they worked. Most employees were left in a state 
of shock and devastation—many of them had worked 
for the company for a number of years and had demon￾strated loyalty and hard work throughout the pandemic. 
What made the situation more controversial was that 
P&O Ferries was not merely downsizing but was engag￾ing in a form of “fire and rehire,” as it later became 
clear that the sacked workers were being replaced 
with cheaper agency staff. Fire and rehire is a practice 
whereby a firm dismisses an employee only to rehire 
them or get another candidate for the same job under 
different, typically less favorable conditions, such as 
lower pay. The practice is not illegal in the United 
Kingdom, but it does raise a lot of ethical, reputational, 
and even safety concerns. In this case, rather than hire 
new staff directly onto their payroll, P&O Ferries de￾cided to hire agency workers. It later transpired that 
these workers were Indian and paid significantly below 
the UK minimum hourly wage by the agency. 
P&O Ferries’ behavior caused significant outrage and 
condemnation by workers’ unions as well as the broader 
media and public. A UK Parliament select committee in￾quiry was initiated to investigate the matter, and criminal 
and civil investigations into the circumstances around 
the redundancies were launched. The RMT, the worker’s 
union to which the sacked seafarers belonged, also called 
for economic sanctions against the company, but it soon 
became clear that the company was in trouble, but for a 
different reason: their ships were grounded for six weeks 
due to the agency crew’s lack of familiarity with the proper 
safety procedures and other operational procedures. But 
the reputational damage is even more significant; several 
months after the scandal, it was revealed that P&O had 
suffered a colossal 92 percent slump in private customer 
transfers and an 87.7 percent decline in freight volume as 
businesses chose not to use the company’s services. While 
tough choices sometimes need to be made to keep a 
business viable, this case shows the consequences of poor 
workforce management decisions.231
Questions
17-15. Identify the instances in this case where 
management should have properly consulted and 
followed the advice of their HR department.
17-16. The company decided to replace the sacked 
seafarers with agency staff from a different 
country on lower wages. Compared to the 
in-house recruitment and selection processes, 
what potential issues do you think this way of 
recruiting staff may cause?
17-17. What do you think may be the consequences of 
such poorly handled HR issues for the company?

 BEATING BURNOUT 
Crisis almost always creates stress. This was certainly true as the COVID-19 
pandemic began to spread around the world. As was the case in many 
hospitals, the Department of Emergency Medicine at Massachusetts General 
Hospital (MGH) in Boston was faced with the task of caring for patients 
who were infected with a deadly, highly contagious, and not well-understood 
disease. However, even in this extreme situation, the leaders at MGH were able 
to employ strategies that helped minimize burnout and, in some cases, even 
increased physician job satisfaction. Physicians at this hospital recognized the 
importance of the institution’s capable leadership, effective communication, 
and ability to obtain necessary resources that were in short supply. 
 Although solving the problem of burnout is complex, the strategies 
utilized by the leadership at MGH align with the factors that psychologists 
have found to increase employee engagement and reduce burnout. To begin 
with, while financial rewards can play a role in reducing burnout, the hospital 
primarily focused on emotional rewards by ensuring that employees knew 
everyone’s work was appreciated and valued. For example, it collected and 
shared feedback from appreciative patients with employees who likely would 
not have otherwise received this feedback. Although physical distancing 
rules made it somewhat challenging, the hospital facilitated more interaction 
between patients and physicians. A video conferencing system was utilized 
when family members could not be at the hospital but could still communicate 
with staff. When physicians were able to have meaningful interactions with 
patients and their families, they reported improved well-being. 
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 627 13/12/22 3:25 AM628 PART 4 The Organization System
During a time of uncertainty, hospital leaders focused on reassuring 
employees through transparent communication. Although they often had 
to communicate difficult information and frequently did not have all the 
answers, they sent e-mail updates almost every day to the entire staff that 
included information about how the leadership team handled the challenging 
choices it had to make. Many staff members were extremely busy, though, 
so keeping up with all the changes via e-mail could be overwhelming. As a 
result, the leadership team began doing “rounds” twice a day to check in 
with frontline doctors and nurses to address immediate concerns as well as 
discuss the ever-changing protocols.
Perhaps one of the most challenging tasks during this time was to 
ensure that employees’ workloads were reasonable. The hospital decided to 
increase the number of physicians in its critical care pod to have fewer total 
patients and put more effort into caring for each one. Though this strategy 
may not seem to make sense financially, the leadership understood that 
patient interactions were now more time-consuming and more emotionally 
draining. Long-term, this was an effective decision as staff could mentally 
recharge and ultimately be more effective at their jobs.
Finally, maintaining a sense of community was crucial. Initiatives were 
implemented to help teams feel more connected, including virtual “wellness 
sessions.” During this time, staff could openly discuss any issues they 
were experiencing. The hospital surveyed staff and found that two-thirds of 
those surveyed reported a greater sense of unity and purpose than they 
had before the pandemic. While the actions taken to prevent burnout will 
look different depending on the industry, the principle that translates across 
settings is empowering individuals to perform their jobs effectively in a safe 
and supportive environment.1
Stress and health are increasingly becoming an important part of organizational 
behavior (OB). Public policy experts, researchers, politicians, managers, 
and employees alike are beginning to recognize that the detrimental effects of 
mismanaged stress at work are a public health crisis. Stress is (quite literally) a killer, 
and the statistics on workplace stress are shocking.2
 One compilation of statistics 
suggests that (1) 94 percent of workers in the United States experience stress at 
their workplace (and 63 percent of them are ready to quit their jobs because of it); 
(2) it results in up to $187 billion in productivity and health care losses annually; (3) 
it causes about two-thirds of U.S. workers to lose sleep; (4) it causes a million people 
to miss work every day; and (5) it results in around 120,000 deaths annually.3
 IBH 
Solutions, a leading provider of wellness programs (discussed later in this chapter), 
finds that employees need professional help at higher rates than ever.4
In this chapter, we describe stress and health in organizations. We discuss 
how the stress process unfolds, mental and physical health considerations at 
work, and the nature of work–life balance. In closing, we consider what individ￾uals and organizations can do to better manage stress levels and realize positive 
outcomes for OB, which, after all, is the purpose of this text.

 The Nature of Stress in Organizations 
 Do you feel stressed? If so, join the crowd. As Exhibit 18- 1 shows, work is a 
major source of stress in the lives of young adults (ages 18–23). Everyone 
experiences stress in some way, shape, or form. Stress emerges from many 
sources at work. Racial prejudice is one particularly nefarious source that 
has left professionals such as Jessica Jackson, a Black clinical psycholo￾gist with the Department of Veterans, strained. Thinking back to her high 
school days, her teacher would say she was in the wrong room and give her 
lower grades than the other classmates (even on group projects). Jackson 
has had the stressful and frustrating task of confronting prejudice and 
discrimination. 5
 
 When you talk about stress with others, you probably refer to all of it uni￾formly as “stress.” 6
 Stressful events and situations stress you out, and you feel the 
impact of stress behaviorally, psychologically, and physically. It is plain to see 
that at its core, stress is part of a process. During this process, many factors (e.g., 
antecedents and consequences) come into play. After all, not everyone becomes

“stressed out” by the same things, and not everyone responds in the same way. 
(Some can even be invigorated by stress; see the OB Poll.) Therefore, it might 
be helpful for us to differentiate between these factors.
In this chapter, we distinguish between stressors, stress, and strain (see the 
model in Exhibit 18-2).7
 First, you are probably most familiar with stress, 
which we define as a generally unpleasant perception and appraisal of stress￾ors. What, then, are stressors? Stressors refer to conditions or events that an 
individual perceives as challenging or threatening. In essence, stressors are 
the antecedents to the experience of stress. An upcoming project deadline 
can be perceived as a challenging or threatening stressor to employees. Then, 
as a result of stress, an individual experiences strain, or the psychological, 
physiological, and behavioral consequences of stress. That project deadline 
and the stress that it causes can lead to strain—for instance, anxiety, lack of 
sleep, and procrastination. Therefore, strain encompasses the consequences 
of the experience of stress.8
Stressors
We tend to distinguish between two types of stressors: challenge and hindrance
stressors.9
 Researchers have argued that challenge stressors—or stressors asso￾ciated with workload, pressure to complete tasks, and time urgency—operate 
quite differently from hindrance stressors—or stressors that keep you from 
reaching your goals (for example, red tape, office politics, confusion over job 
responsibilities).10
Evidence suggests that both challenge and hindrance stressors lead to 
strain,11 although hindrance stressors lead to increased strain levels.12 Challenge 
stressors lead to more motivation, engagement, and performance than hin￾drance stressors.13 On the other hand, hindrance stressors appear to negatively 
affect safety compliance and participation, employee engagement, job satisfac￾tion, organizational commitment, performance, and withdrawal than do chal￾lenge stressors.14 Social situations have been traditionally viewed as hindrance 
stressors (e.g., interpersonal conflict). However, some recent research is chal￾lenging this notion and suggesting some people view winning others over as an 
invigorating challenge (e.g., sales professionals, development officers),15 navi￾gated effectively by the politically skilled.16
Researchers have sought to clarify the conditions under which each type 
of stressor begins the stress process. For example, challenge stressors tend to 
lead to improved work engagement when employees are in a good mood.17
Individual differences play a role. Conscientious employees are also more 
likely to view both challenge and hindrance stressors negatively (because they 
are more perceptive and aware that they are stressors), resulting in strain and 
increased turnover.18 Moreover, those who hold power are more likely to see 
stressors as challenging instead of hindering. However, when they become 
aware that other people rely on them to make things happen, these challenges 
become hindrances.18
The timing and context also matter. Employees who experience challenge 
stressors inconsistently (e.g., they come and go instead of remaining constant 
and predictable) can actually experience strain and performance losses.20
Moreover, unnecessary tasks can act as hindrance stressors that thwart the 
positive aspects of challenge stressors. (In other words, too many hindrance 
stressors can cancel out the good effects of challenge stressors.)21 Challenge 
stressors improve job performance in a supportive work environment, whereas 
hindrance stress reduces job performance in all work environments.22
Exhibit 18-2 suggests that stressors can come from environmental, organiza￾tional, or personal sources.23

M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 630 13/12/22 3:25 AMStress and Health in Organizations CHAPTER ­1 631
Environmental Stressors Just as environmental uncertainty influences an orga￾nization’s design and structure, it also influences stress levels among employees 
in that organization.24 Two types of environmental uncertainty are worth men￾tioning: economic and political. Changes in the business cycle create economic 
uncertainties. When the economy is in a recession, people become increasingly 
anxious about their job security.25 Political uncertainties result when political 
threats and changes induce stress. For instance, during the political turmoil 
that ensued in the United States in 2020, the majority of surveyed Americans 
reported “the future of [the] nation,” “the current political climate,” and 
“political unrest around the nation” as significant stressors.26
Organizational Stressors There is no shortage of factors within an organization 
that can cause stress. Pressures to avoid errors or complete tasks in a limited 
time, work overload, a demanding and insensitive boss, and unpleasant cowork￾ers are a few examples. We have categorized these factors around the task, role, 
and interpersonal demands. Task demands relate to a person’s job. They include 
the design of the job (including its degree of autonomy, task variety, and auto￾mation), working conditions, and the physical work layout. Role demands relate 
to pressures placed on a person as a function of their particular role in the orga￾nization.27 As some examples, role conflict creates expectations that may be 
hard to reconcile or satisfy. Role overload occurs when the employee is expected 
to take on too much. Role ambiguity means role expectations are not clearly 
understood and the employee is not sure what to do. Interpersonal demands are 
pressures created by other employees. Some pressures are expected, but a rap￾idly growing body of research has shown that negative coworker and supervisor 
behaviors, including fights, bullying, incivility, abusive supervision, and racial/
sexual harassment, are very strongly related to stress at work.28
Personal Stressors The typical individual may work between forty and fifty hours 
a week. But the experiences and problems people encounter in the other hours 
of the week can “spill over” (see the upcoming section on work–life balance) 
to the job. For example, the quality and quantity of sleep an individual gets can

adversely affect the amount of strain they experience.28 The final category of 
sources of stress at work includes factors of an employee’s personal life: family 
issues and personal economic problems. Family issues, even good ones, can cause 
stress that has a significant impact on individuals.29 Family issues are often closely 
related to work–life conflict.31 Lastly, personal economic problems of overextended 
financial resources create stress and siphon attention away from work.
Stressors Are Additive When we review stressors individually, it is easy to over￾look that stress is an additive phenomenon—it builds up.31 For example, when 
you experience incivility from customers or coworkers, this can lead you to have 
a poor night’s sleep and experience additional strain beyond the incivility you 
just experienced.32 Each new and persistent stressor adds to an individual’s 
stress level. So a single stressor may be relatively unimportant in and of itself. 
Still, if added to an already high level of stress, it can be too much. To appraise 
the total amount of stress an individual is under, we must add up all the sources 
and severity levels of that person’s stress. Because this cannot be easily quanti￾fied or observed, managers should remain aware of the potential stress loads 
from organizational factors. Many employees are willing to express their per￾ceived stress load at work to a caring manager.
Strain
Stress manifests as strain in many ways, such as high blood pressure, ulcers, irri￾tability, difficulty making routine decisions, changes in appetite, accident prone￾ness, and the like. Refer back to Exhibit 18-2. These symptoms fit under three 
general categories: physiological, psychological, and behavioral symptoms.34
The former two we discuss in greater detail in the next sections.
Physiological Strain Most early concern with stress was directed at physiological 
symptoms because most researchers were specialists in the health and medical 
sciences. Their work concluded that stress could create changes in metabolism, 
increase heart and breathing rates and blood pressure, bring on headaches, 
and induce heart attacks.35 Evidence now clearly suggests stress may have other 
harmful physiological effects, including backaches, headaches, eye strain, sleep 
disturbances, dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal problems, and 
even cardiovascular disease.36 Other research has found that stress, in general, 
impairs episodic memory (but enhances memory after a stressful event).37
Psychological Strain Job dissatisfaction (see the chapter on job attitudes) is an 
obvious cause of stress. But stress shows itself in other psychological states—for 
instance, tension, anxiety, irritability, and boredom. Jobs that provide a low level 
of variety, significance, autonomy, feedback, and identity appear to create stress 
and reduce satisfaction and involvement in the job.38
Behavioral Strain Research on behavior and stress has been conducted across sev￾eral countries. Over time, the relationships appear relatively consistent. Behavior￾related stress symptoms include reductions in productivity; increases in absences, 
safety incidents, and turnover; changes in eating habits; increased smoking or 
consumption of alcohol; rapid speech; fidgeting; and sleep disorders.39
Eustress
Although stress is typically discussed in a negative context, it also has a positive 
purpose.40 In response to stress, your nervous system, hypothalamus, pituitary, 
and adrenal glands supply you with stress hormones to cope. Your heartbeat and 
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 632 13/12/22 3:25 AMStress and Health in Organizations CHAPTER ­1 633
breathing accelerate to increase oxygen while your muscles tense for action.41 This 
is a time when stress offers potential gain. Consider, for example, the superior per￾formance of an athlete or stage performer in a critical situation. Such individuals 
often use stress positively to rise to the occasion and perform at their maximum. 
Similarly, many professionals see the pressures of heavy workloads and deadlines as 
positive challenges that enhance the quality of their work and the satisfaction they 
get from their job. This form of stress has been labeled as eustress (from Greek root 
eu, meaning “good”), or a healthy, positive, and constructive appraisal of stressors.42
A significant amount of research has investigated the positive aspects of 
stress. One proposed pattern of this relationship is the inverted U shown in 
Exhibit 18-3.43 The logic underlying the figure is that low to moderate stress 
levels stimulate the body and increase its ability to react. Individuals may per￾form tasks better, more intensely, or more rapidly. But too much stress places 
impossible demands on a person that results in lower performance. Despite its 
popularity and intuitive appeal, the inverted-U model has not earned a lot of 
empirical support.44 Maybe the model misses links between stressors and felt 
stress and performance? Sometimes, we could be stressed, but we feel fine for 
other reasons (e.g., individual differences, mood, context).45 Therefore, this 
model may be a good, neutral starting point from which to study differences. 
But we need to consider that the curve may be shifted left or right for certain 
employees in certain environments.
Physical Health at Work
Stressors and the experience of stress can result in both physical and psychological 
strain that often co-occur in response to stress.46 The COVID-19 pandemic high￾lighted just how strong health implications are for organizational functioning.47
For instance, one in four essential workers has been diagnosed with a mental 
health disorder since the onset of the pandemic. In addition, approximately one 
in three received treatment from a mental health professional.48 The “collec￾tive trauma” of the pandemic led to many employees describing a deterioration 
in physical and mental health.49 In this section, we describe why acknowledg￾ing physical and mental health matters in organizations and the areas that have 
received the most attention by researchers and practitioners, which in the past 
several decades, has emerged as its own field within the OB domain.50

As described in the previous section, physical health is a major form of strain 
in organizations.51 Although we often think of physical health as an extremely 
important outcome in its own right (poor health can lead to premature death), 
physical health also influences important work outcomes such as interpersonal 
relationships, productivity, and withdrawal. For instance, immune system health, 
inflammation, and the gut biome have all been shown to influence emotion, 
motivation, thinking, and behavior at work.52 Although the link between vari￾ous physiological systems and behavior in the workplace is emerging, we focus 
on two areas that have been subject to quite a bit of attention in recent years: 
(1) sleep and (2) illness and injury.
Sleep
If you have ever held a job where you clocked into work after very little sleep, 
you probably remember how difficult it was. You may have used caffeine to try 
to stay awake, counted the hours until the end of your shift, and performed 
your tasks in a cognitively detached manner. You may have been called out by 
a supervisor for errors or inattentiveness or even had poor interactions with 
your coworkers. Indeed, the effects of sleep (see also Myth or Science?) and the 
fatigue that results (i.e., sleepiness) have piqued the interests of researchers in 
particular,53 with the majority of studies suggesting that sleep quality has a mod￾erately negative impact on job attitudes and psychological health and mood at 
work.54 Moreover, sleep deprivation has a substantial impact on memory,55 cog￾nitive task performance,56 and more general job outcomes for both managers 
and employees, like task performance, attendance, safety behavior, and coun￾terproductive work behaviors (CWBs).57 A lack of good-quality sleep primarily 
harms performance by depleting cognitive resources and causes an uptick in 
CWB due to its negative effect on mood and self-control.58
Various work-related stressors have been shown to impair sleep quality; such 
stressors include unfinished work tasks, social stressors, poor leadership, per￾ceived discrimination, and role conflict.59 As described in the previous section, 
these stressors tend to have a compounding effect. Compounding job demands 
(and poor stress management) can lead to a steady decrease in sleep quality over 
the workweek, leaving you drained by the end of the week.60 So what can be done 
to combat poor sleep? Research suggests that, beyond the obvious solution of get￾ting more, good-quality sleep,61 physical activity, recovery experiences with social 
support groups and possibly even wearing blue light-blocking glasses can help.62
Illness and Injury
A second area of physical health that OB practitioners and researchers are con￾cerned with is illness and injury due to its connection with absenteeism and produc￾tivity loss.64 Although COVID-19 highlighted the dangers of coming to work while 
sick, a whopping nine out of ten employees in one large survey admitted to going to 
work sick before the pandemic.63 Although we will likely see the culture change sur￾rounding the acceptability of working sick in the United States, many attribute the 
hesitance to stay home to losing sick leave and inflexible or coercive supervisors.66
Clearly, going into work while sick is not optimal for obvious reasons.67
First and foremost, working close to others while sick with a contagious disease 
increases the risk that other team members will also become ill (and will likely 
increase their anxieties about working with you, especially during COVID-19).68
Second, people are not as effective at doing their jobs when ill or injured and 
can slow work processes. This effect will be even greater if the illness is spread 
to other members of the team, who then experience the same decrements. OB 
professionals refer to working while ill or injured as presenteeism.
69 presenteeism The act of working while ill 
or injured.
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 634 13/12/22 3:25 AMStress and Health in Organizations CHAPTER ­1 635
 Who is more likely to go to work while sick? Employees are more likely to 
engage in presenteeism when work forces compel them to and when they have 
a chronic physical condition (e.g., asthma). 70 Moreover, people are strongly 
compelled to work when they love their job and want to work. 69 Organizational 
culture (see the chapter on culture and change) plays a substantial role here, 
with cultures tending to encourage presenteeism, discourage presenteeism, or 
otherwise emphasize individual choice. 72 To this point, we have suggested that 
presenteeism is not the best choice. Some, however, suggest that it is more a 
matter of degree. People with chronic conditions or those with more minor 
illnesses can perhaps be effective when provided with flexibility and resources, 
functionally continuing their work. 73
Personal and Work Risk Factors Most of us spend nearly one-third of our daily 
waking lives at work. Logically, our experiences at work influence what we do to 
promote our health and well-being. In fact, one review of nearly three hundred 
studies suggests that what we do in the workplace is just as much of a risk factor
for illness as is secondhand smoke! 74 Many examples abound of how workplace 
stressors and unhealthy behavior at work are risk factors for physical ailments. 
 Myth or Science? When You Are Working Hard, Sleep Is Optional 
 T
his statement is false. Individuals 
who do not get enough sleep are 
unable to perform well on the job. 
One study found that sleeplessness 
costs U.S. employers $63.2 billion per 
year, almost $2,300 per employee, par￾tially due to decreased productivity and 
increased safety issues. Sleep depriva￾tion has been cited as a contributing 
factor in heart disease, obesity, stroke, 
and cancer. It can also lead to disas￾trous accidents. For example, U.S. 
military researchers report that sleep 
deprivation is one of the top causes of 
friendly fire (when soldiers mistakenly 
fire on their own troops), and 20 per￾cent of auto accidents are due to 
drowsy drivers. More than 158 people 
on Air India Flight 812 from Dubai to 
Mangalore were killed when pilot Zlatko 
Glusica awoke from a nap and, suffer￾ing from sleep inertia, overshot the 
runway in one of India’s deadliest air 
crashes. 
 Sleeplessness affects the perfor￾mance of millions of workers. According 
to research, one-third of U.S. employees 
in most industries, and more than one￾quarter of workers in the finance and 
insurance industry, are sleep deprived, 
getting fewer than six hours of sleep per 
night (seven to nine are recommended). 
More than 50  percent of U.S. adults 
age 19 to 29, 43 percent age 30 to 45, 
and 38 percent age 46 to 64 report that 
they rarely or never get a good night’s 
sleep on weekdays. 
 Research has shown that lack 
of sleep impairs our ability to learn 
skills and find solutions, which may 
be part of why law enforcement orga￾nizations, Super Bowl–winning football 
teams, and half the Fortune 500 com￾panies employ so-called fatigue man￾agement specialists as performance 
consultants. 
 Along with sleeplessness, insomnia 
has been a growing problem. Recent 
research in Norway indicated that up 
to 34 percent of motor vehicle deaths 
during the fourteen-year study period 
might have been prevented if the peo￾ple involved in the crashes had not dis￾played insomnia symptoms. Managers 
and employees increasingly take pre￾scription sleep aids, attend sleep 
labs, and consume caffeine to either 
sleep better or reduce the effects of 
sleeplessness on their performance. 
These methods often backfire. Studies 
indicate that prescription sleep aids 
increase sleep time by only eleven 
minutes and cause short-term memory 
loss. The effects of sleep labs may not 
be helpful after the sessions are over. 
And the diminishing returns of caffeine, 
perhaps the most popular method of 
fighting sleep deprivation (74  percent 
of U.S. adults consume caffeine every 
day), require the ingestion of increasing 
amounts to achieve alertness, which 
can make users jittery before the effect 
wears off and leave them exhausted. 
 When you are working hard, it is 
easy to consider using sleep hours to 
get the job done and to think that the 
stress and adrenaline from working will 
keep you alert. It is also easy to con￾sider artificial methods in attempts to 
counteract the negative impact of sleep 
deprivation. However, research indi￾cates that we are not good at assess￾ing our impaired capabilities when we 
are sleep deprived when it comes to 
maximizing performance and reducing 
accidents. In the end, there is no sub￾stitute for a solid night’s sleep. 63
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 635 13/12/22 3:25 AM636 PART 4 The Organization System
For instance, a 21-year-old intern at Merrill Lynch collapsed and died due to 
working 72 hours straight.75 Moreover, after a steel mill closed its doors for 
good, leaving many employees out of work, one 56-year old employee died of a 
heart attack shortly after due to the shock.76
Although there may be a direct link between what we experience at work 
and our health, it is more likely that people behave in unhealthy ways to cope 
with stressors at work. For instance, employees may skip lunch, eat convenient 
and unhealthy foods, smoke cigarettes, neglect their sleep needs, or abuse sub￾stances to cope with stress at work.77 One study of nearly five thousand work￾ers demonstrated that these behaviors were linked to many metabolic risk factors
associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and immune system diseases. 
More specifically, the regular experience of hindrance stressors at work resulted 
in moderate increases in high-risk eating and cigarette smoking, leading to 
increases in worrisome, objective health indicators such as body mass index 
(BMI), cholesterol levels, and insulin resistance.78 These metabolic risk factors 
can lead to health conditions such as obesity, resulting in increased company 
health costs, the risk for absenteeism and injury, and even prejudice and dis￾crimination.79 Stress at work can also lead individuals to injury, as they start to 
neglect safety behavior. For instance, the exhausting experiences of worrying 
about health and financial threats from COVID-19 led many workers to relax 
their safety behaviors.80
It is difficult for employees to engage in healthy behavior when they experi￾ence stress at work. Employees encountering high-stress levels and stressors at 
work can mitigate these risks through planning. Employees that plan for eating 
healthy and physical exercise are more likely to follow through than those acting 
out of convenience or impulse.81 Moreover, programs targeted toward develop￾ing resilience (described later in this chapter) can reduce physical health risks 
related to stress at work.82
Mental Health at Work
Just as workplace stress can affect physical health through increases in risky, 
unhealthy behavior, so, too, does workplace stress affect mental health at work.81
In fact, the cost of treating employees with both physical and mental health condi￾tions is two to three times higher than those without co-occurring illnesses.84 In the 
United States, 51.5 million adults over the age of 18 reported they were suffering 
from a mental health disorder in 2019.85 What is the impact on work outcomes? 
Conditions such as depression reduce cognitive performance 35 percent of the time 
at work.86 In our discussion of mental health in the workplace, we focus on three 
primary areas: (1) job insecurity as a stressor, (2) workaholism behaviors, and (3) 
the experience of psychological distress at work, including burnout and depression.
Job Insecurity
Employees experience job insecurity when they perceive that their jobs are at 
risk or that their employment is not stable.87 Job insecurity is a highly emo￾tional perception that greatly affects employees’ mental health, affecting 
sleep, depressive symptoms, and burnout.88 Although job insecurity can reflect 
increased demands on the job, it is more likely signaled by a lack of social and 
structural resources, such as fair interpersonal treatment and communication, 
leader–member exchange, and support and trust from coworkers, most often in 
environments where unemployment is high.89
As a stressor, job insecurity is relatively unique. It prompts employees to do 
what they can to preserve their jobs, adjust their efforts to signal their viability, or

maladaptive mental 
health conditions 
can manifest as 
a consequence of 
stressors at work.
job insecurity The perception that one’s 
job is at risk or that one’s employment is not 
stable.

to reconsider their employment. Job insecurity can motivate employees to build 
stronger relations with their coworkers and supervisors to reduce the insecurity, 
 Toward a Better World 
 Freelancers Union: Advocating for Gig 
Workers Faced with Consistent Job Insecurity 
 In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
more than 48 million Americans applied 
for unemployment insurance. Although 
rideshare drivers are “gig workers,” 
they were classified as “essential work￾ers” by the government and permitted 
to continue working during the pan￾demic. The experience was extremely 
stressful for many of these workers, 
who faced job insecurity through plum￾meting demand and lack of financial 
support. Moreover, these drivers faced 
immense health concerns due to fear 
of infection. For instance, one Uber 
driver (Julie of Cincinnati, Ohio) was ter￾rified to continue working for the ride￾share company as the sole provider for 
her family. She recalled driving one day 
during the pandemic, noting that “each 
of the people tipped me just a little 
over a dollar and I’m sorry, but my life 
is worth more than that.” 
 Shortly after this experience, Julie 
applied for unemployment. However, 
what is unique about this situation is 
that normally Julie would not have been 
eligible for unemployment because 
she is a gig worker. The passage 
of the federal CARES Act extended 
unemployment eligibility to gig work￾ers during this time of crisis. Notably, 
many gig workers lost these ben￾efits in states where leaders cut off 
Pandemic Unemployment Assistance 
(PUA) before the assistance was set to 
expire. During normal times, gig work￾ers potentially face many hindrance 
stressors that adversely affect their 
stress levels and, ultimately, their 
mental health, which includes job 
insecurity, unclear employment status, 
non-reimbursed expenses, continu￾ously declining reimbursement rates, 
an inability to make a living wage, 
competition with other gig workers, 
employer double standards (treating 
them like other employees but provid￾ing fewer resources), dishonest clients 
(breaching terms of the agreement and 
withholding pay), “hustling” to gain new 
clients, and no clear career advance￾ment opportunities. 
 However, the picture is not all doom 
and gloom: As Louis Hyman writes in 
Temp , gig work involves a great deal 
of autonomy and independence—job 
characteristics that would normally 
be highly coveted aspects of work. 
However, Hyman argues that the way 
forward is to reconnect gig workers 
with the job resources and support that 
these workers would have received 
in traditional employer–employee 
arrangements. It is in these additional 
resources that the demands of gig 
work can be alleviated. As Hyman sug￾gests: “Americans need life security . . . 
not job security.” This has caused many 
people to begin organizing and advocat￾ing for “life security” on behalf of gig 
workers. However, the National Labor 
Relations Act in the United States cur￾rently does not apply to gig workers 
despite a majority expressing interest 
in joining a union (for instance, by one 
survey, 80 percent of Los Angeles ride￾sharing drivers). This has not stopped 
gig workers from uniting to advocate 
for better benefits and security. For 
instance, the Freelancers Union is the 
fastest- growing and largest entity (it is 
technically not a union with collective 
bargaining power) uniting gig workers 
today. 
 Although the 500,000 members 
only make up a fraction of the 56.7 mil￾lion gig workers in the United States, 
the Freelancers Union offers free 
membership with many resources 
since the 1990s. For instance, the 
union offers insurance benefit options, 
including health, dental, term life, dis￾ability, vision, and liability. It is a source 
of social support and advice from 
experts and other gig workers, includ￾ing legal and financial tools. For those 
members living in New York City, the 
union offers the use of the Freelancers 
Hub. Although its physical space shut 
its doors due to the pandemic, it is a 
virtual community space for New York 
City’s gig workers. 
 Most notably, the Freelancers Union 
is working with legislators to determine 
how they can advocate for gig worker 
policy change. Rafael Espinal, the exec￾utive director of the union, notes that 
it is a challenge to balance all sides of 
the picture. Espinal suggests that the 
major question is “How can we create 
a bill that will strike the right balance 
between making sure that workers . . . 
get the justice they need but not hav￾ing a negative impact on freelancers 
who do independent work and are 
happy with the freedom they currently 
have?” Regardless of how people view 
gig work, the fact is that most gig work￾ers do experience heightened levels of 
strain that threaten their health as con￾tributors to society. Indeed, the future 
for gig workers is uncertain despite 
attempts to come together and advo￾cate for gig worker rights and enhance 
access to resources. But just as the 
gig economy increased demand for this 
category of workers, the systems can 
also adjust to support these workers 
and provide the resources they need to 
ensure manageable stress and good 
health. 106
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 637 13/12/22 3:25 AM638 PART 4 The Organization System
or alternatively, consider other places to work.90 Interestingly, job insecurity is an 
especially salient stressor for gig workers,91 and it negatively affects their job atti￾tudes.92 Although these workers have much greater autonomy than traditional 
full- or part-time employees, gig workers experience more strain and work–
family conflict (discussed later in this chapter).93 Due to the nature of their 
work, gig workers are prone to experience fluctuations in their workloads—
demands they have to meet to ensure they are hired again and protect their 
valuable reputation with other clients (pressures that lead to increased strain).94
Workaholism
One possible response to job insecurity is workaholism (although it can also 
be because people really love their jobs and feel a calling to work excessively).95
Workaholism involves feeling compelled to work due to internal pressures, thinking 
about work even when not working, and going above and beyond what is reasonably 
expected (to one’s own detriment).96 Leaders tend to be especially prone to worka￾holism. For instance, some leaders feel compelled to “sacrifice” their personal lives 
and recovery time to “keep the ship running,” which can lead to workaholic behav￾iors.97 Similarly, self-employed entrepreneurs regularly cope with job insecurity by 
working more than they should. They tend to earn more because of it (despite a 
negative impact on their health).98 In some ways, they might seem like ideal employ￾ees. This perception might be why, when most people are asked in interviews what 
their greatest weakness is, they may reflexively say, “I just work too hard.” However, 
there is a difference between working hard and working compulsively.99
Workaholic behavior does not necessarily lead to more productivity than 
others, despite the extreme efforts involved. The strain of putting in such a high 
level of work effort eventually begins to wear on the person, leading to higher 
levels of work–life conflict, burnout, and higher blood pressure.100 Moreover, 
the nature of work might change as a result of workaholic behaviors: One study 
of nearly two thousand dentists demonstrated that workaholic behaviors led to 
an increase in challenging workplace stressors along with an eventual increase 
in structural resources (perhaps also increasing job security).101 Although job 
security might be improved by workaholic tendencies, the costs employees pay 
in burnout suggests that it is likely not worth the trouble.
Psychological Distress at Work
Some employees encounter psychologically traumatic experiences in their jobs. 
For instance, many first responders recall the horrifying incidents they must expe￾rience that lead to psychological distress. As one firefighter noted, “Today, when I 
lay down and sleep at night, I can still see the faces” of the tragic victims encoun￾tered on the job. “I carry that with me. I will see that the rest of my life.”102 These 
experiences highlight the mental health toll of burnout and depression at work.
Burnout Many employees at some point in their careers experience burnout, 
a work-related mental health syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, 
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.103 Emotional exhaus￾tion refers to feeling overextended and emotionally depleted. Depersonalization
refers to maladaptively coping with the job through callousness and distancing. 
Reduced personal accomplishment means losing a sense of productivity or contribu￾tion on the job.104 Some consider burnout to effectively be the “opposite” of job 
engagement discussed in previous chapters.
105
Burnout has a moderate effect on employee outcomes, including an increase 
in absenteeism and turnover along with a reduction in job performance.108
Research also shows that the effects of burnout compound. Although stressors

lead to burnout as a form of strain, the experience of burnout also leads to the 
emergence of newer stressors in a vicious cycle.109 For example, being burned 
out can lead to reduced performance, leading to supervisor disciplinary action 
(a new stressor).
Moreover, some employees are more likely than others to experience burn￾out. Those low on emotional stability, for instance, are more likely to experi￾ence emotional exhaustion. At the same time, high extroversion in employees 
is linked with a lower likelihood of emotional exhaustion (along with a higher 
sense of personal accomplishment).110 Women are more likely to experi￾ence emotional exhaustion than men, but men are more likely to experience 
depersonalization than women.111 Furthermore, cultures characterized by tight, 
masculine norms (see the chapter on diversity, equity, and inclusion in organi￾zations) tend to be more prone to burnout than looser, egalitarian societies.112
Depression Despite a large degree of attention, some researchers suggest that 
burnout is very similar in many ways to depression,
113 a mental health disor￾der characterized by sadness, loss of interest, despondency, and dejection. 
Depressive symptoms such as these often co-occur with other negative emotions 
such as anxiety and anger.114
Of all mental health conditions, depression is the most common mental health 
condition (affecting about 9.5 percent of the U.S. population annually), leading 
to serious difficulties at work.115 Like workaholism and burnout, depressive states 
are heavily predicted by constant job insecurity (although depressive symptoms 
also tend to reinforce perceptions of job insecurity, with suffering employees expe￾riencing a heightened awareness of their job insecurity).112 Moreover, negative 
interpersonal interactions (e.g., bullying, social isolation) can cause employees to 
become depressed over time;116 those bullied while depressed can experience a 
psychological sting so painful that some may even contemplate suicide.117
The good news is that the immediate cessation of the bullying experiences 
tends to reduce depressive symptoms very quickly in some cases.115 Moreover, 
interventions that reduce the stigma surrounding mental health conditions and 
convey appreciation for employees can effectively reduce depression.119
Mechanisms of Health and Stress
Now that we have established the nature of stress and health in organizations, 
let us describe how they emerge. Although there are many compelling health 
and stress theories in OB, we focus on four of the most popular in this 
section: conservation of resources, demand-control-support, job demands-resources, and 
effort-reward-imbalance.120
Conservation of Resources
Conservation of resources (COR) theory suggests that employees strive to obtain, 
foster, retain, and protect the resources and things they value.121 Resources
are factors within an individual’s control that can be expended toward fulfill￾ing desires, attaining goals, or meeting task demands. Employees must invest 
time and energy to gain resources and protect or replenish resources from 
loss. Concerning stress, employees are more aware of resource losses than 
resource gains. In other words, a missed opportunity is not as concerning as a 
loss of a cherished resource. However, when resources have been lost, employ￾ees become motivated to replace what was lost. Moreover, when people are 
overextended or exhausted, they become desperate, defensive, aggressive, and 
irrational in their pursuit of regaining or replenishing what was lost.122
18-4 Compare the four 
major stress and health 
theories.
resources Factors within an individual’s 
control that can be expended toward fulfilling 
desires, attaining goals, or meeting task 
demands.
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 639 13/12/22 3:25 AM640 PART 4 The Organization System
Research has been supportive of COR theory. Diminished job control and 
social support have been linked with burnout, suggesting that a loss of resources 
leads to strain in the form of burnout.123 As another example, in the presence 
of stressors, employees tend to engage in less voice behavior (see the chapter 
on power and politics), supporting the resource conservation tenant of COR 
theory.124 Moreover, seeing other coworkers treated unfairly or even becom￾ing aware of your romantic partner’s job insecurity can result in resource loss. 
Employees may be more likely to lose self-control or experience strain following 
these losses of resources.125 Even when these stressors are “good” for the orga￾nization, like an enhanced organizational reputation, the demands associated 
with performing at a high level can threaten employee resources and lead to 
turnover.126
Finally, research on leaders in organizations tends to be one area that has 
garnered a lot of support for COR theory. Leaders tend to conserve their 
resources by selectively building relationships with their followers (i.e., LMX dif￾ferentiation).124 Moreover, they conserve resources when strategically deciding 
when to try something new (a resource-intensive task) or defaulting to the old 
ways of doing things.128 Moreover, leader transformational leadership behavior 
(see the chapter on leadership), although beneficial for followers, can be quite 
taxing on leaders, eventually leading to resource losses, emotional exhaustion, 
and turnover.129
Effort-Reward Imbalance Model
Although falling out of favor in recent years, the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) 
suggests that employees will experience strain when they put in a great deal of 
effort for little reward. In turn, employees are motivated to resolve this discrep￾ancy by either (1) putting in less effort or (2) working to maximize or increase 
the reward.130
Although some research on the ERI model supports that imbalance leads 
to decreased engagement and increased turnover intentions,131 the issue lies 
in what efforts and rewards we are talking about. Although we may immedi￾ately jump to salary when thinking about reward—research found that job secu￾rity and a sense of competence were related to health to a degree greater than
salary.132
Moreover, some facets of effort or reward may depend upon the job in ques￾tion. For instance, research on bus drivers suggests that effort could involve deal￾ing with road conditions, or interacting with passengers, as some examples.133
Clearly, a bus driver who perceives fewer rewards on the job would be more 
likely to give up on customer service rather than dealing with road conditions 
(when everyone’s lives are at stake!).
As another issue, at what point does the imbalance between effort and 
reward becoming meaningful or compelling enough to cause changes in the 
stress experience? It is hard to imagine any imbalance causing distress. It is also 
hard to pinpoint which is the bigger contributor to the imbalance: effort or 
reward.131
Job Demand-Control-Support Model
An upcoming project deadline at work is not so bad when you have support 
from coworkers and supervisors, along with control over how you attain it. The 
job demand-control-support (JDCS) model suggests strain is a function of three 
factors: demands, control, and support.135 Demands are the responsibilities, 
pressures, obligations, and uncertainties that individuals face in the workplace. 
Control, similar to autonomy discussed in previous chapters (see the chapter on 
demands Responsibilities, pressures, 
obligations, and even uncertainties that 
individuals face in the workplace.

motivation theory), refers to the degree to which employees have discretion 
over how to do their jobs. Support (similar to the perceived support constructs 
discussed in the chapter on attitudes) is essentially perceptions of assistance pro￾vided by the organization, supervisor, and coworkers. The main tenant behind 
the JDCS model is that any negative effects of demands on strain can be offset 
or buffered by control and support, as shown in Exhibit 18-4.
Research on the initial JDCS model has not been very supportive of the 
theory in general.136 However, the “buffering” tenant of the theory has been 
supported in prior work,137 and demands and control have both been linked 
separately to the increase and decrease in mortality odds, respectively.138 Many 
have suggested alterations to the theory to remedy these issues. For instance, 
one meta-analysis supported the JDCS, but only when various sources of support 
were disentangled (e.g., supervisor support mattered more than coworker sup￾port).139 Taking this “disentanglement” approach further, another meta-analysis 
found that whether the JDCS was supported depended upon several factors, 
including the employees’ gender, nationality, and occupations.140 Moreover, 
some work has “disentangled” the nature of demands, separating challenge and 
hindrance stressors as demands (see our earlier discussion). In these studies, 
the JDCS was only supported for hindrance stressors and not challenge stressors 
because challenges are not viewed negatively by everyone.141
Job Demands-Resources Model
When you undergo your annual performance review at work, you feel stress 
because you confront challenge and hindrance demands. A good performance 
review may lead to a promotion, greater responsibilities, and a higher salary.

A poor review may prevent you from getting a promotion. An extremely poor 
review might even result in your being fired. To the extent you can draw on 
resources to meet the demands placed on you—such as preparing for the review, 
putting the review in perspective (it is not the end of the world), or obtain￾ing social support—you will feel less stress and experience less strain. The job 
demands-resources (JDR) model depicted in Exhibit 18-5 combines elements of 
COR theory and the JDCS to suggest that demands and resources both contrib￾ute to performance through their distinctive effects on strain (e.g., burnout) 
and engagement.142
The JDR is one of the most popular stress and health theories to date, 
and research tends to support its utility. Both demands and resources lead 
to strain (e.g., burnout) as expected.143 However, the relationship between 
demands and engagement does not tend to be as strong as the other rela￾tionships in the model, as sometimes challenging demands (e.g., challenge 
stressors) can lead employees to become engaged.144 Moreover, the influ￾ence of resources often depends on the organizational climate, supportive 
leadership, and psychological safety in the team or organization: Will others 
look down on you if you draw on resources?145 Researchers have also sup￾ported the JDR in the safety context, with strain leading to safety incidents 
and engagement in compliant safety behaviors, reducing these incidents’ 
likelihood.146 The JDR has even been supported in populations of students 
and teachers.147
In general, the JDR helps us understand that strain and engagement 
are often the results of a balancing act between drawing on resources and 
meeting demands. It can help us explain, for instance, why people with 
high levels of educational attainment are not more satisfied with their jobs: 
Although the resources are greater with higher education (e.g., income, 
autonomy), the demands are also greater (e.g., longer hours, higher 
pressure).148
Allostasis The discussion so far may give you the impression that individuals 
seek a steady state in which demands match resources perfectly. While early 
research emphasized such a homeostatic, or balanced, equilibrium perspective, it 
has now become clear that no single ideal state exists. Instead, it is more accu￾rate to talk about allostatic models where demands shift, resources shift, and 
systems of addressing imbalances shift.149 By allostasis, we work to find stability 
by changing our behaviors and attitudes. It all depends on the allostatic load, or 
the cumulative effect of stressors on us, given the resources we draw upon.150
For example, suppose you feel especially confident in your abilities 
and have lots of support from others. In that case, you may increase 
your willingness to experience strain and be better able to mobilize cop￾ing resources.151 This would be a situation where the allostatic load was 
not too great; in other cases where the allostatic load is too great and 
too prolonged, we may experience psychological or physiological stress 
symptoms.
Demand-resource preferences change in cycles. You have experienced this 
when you sometimes just feel like relaxing and recovering. At other times you 
welcome more stimulation and challenge. Much like organizations are in con￾stant change and flux, we respond to stress processes by continually adapt￾ing to internal and external sources, and our stability is constantly redefined. 
Demands also change predictably over time themselves. One study of workers 
across the life span found that strain is caused partly by financial and eco￾nomic demands for younger workers—but for older workers, the demands 
associated with strain are more associated with caregiving demands (e.g., par￾enting, eldercare).152

Work–Life Balance
Katharina Boesche is a self-employed lawyer struggling to juggle work and fam￾ily responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mandatory school closures 
resulted in her three children being home, which has made it difficult to find 
quiet time to work. Boesche works in the early morning hours (between 4 a.m. 
and 8 a.m.) or late at night. As a result of these stressors, Boesche feels very 
strained, burned out, and exhausted. Boesche’s experiences reflect the strug￾gles in managing one’s work and home lives.153
In this section, we describe the nature of work–life balance in organizations 
while recognizing that we do not mean “balance” as a state of equilibrium—
more like a “balancing act.”154 To this day, most employees aspire toward the 
ideal of balance, and it is an important predictor of work and family attitudes 
and performance.155 We describe first the nature of boundaries and the transi￾tions that occur across them. Next, we describe two forms of “spillover” which 
have implications for employees: conflict and enrichment. Finally, we discuss 
the role that supportive work policies play in assisting employees in manag￾ing and prioritizing their valued commitments. But first, where does the world 
stand on the issue of work–life balance?
The State of Work–Life Balance: A New Normal?
The COVID-19 pandemic has put work–life balance, boundaries, conflict, 
and enrichment in the spotlight. But even before the pandemic, the fine line 
between work and home life had been consistently and progressively blurring 
over the years. Employees clung to their smartphones. (Some researchers have 
described them as “adult pacifiers.”) They strived to be accessible and connected 
to coworkers 24/7 following the turn of the millennium.156 Strong norms com￾pelled many to sacrifice their personal lives and always be “hustling” to achieve 
success without paying any mind to boundaries, stress, or health implications of 
such decisions.154
But with this jarring transition, a sizable portion of the populace worldwide 
became “remote workers”—seemingly overnight. As Kevin Collins, CEO of 
Charli, noted: “The global pandemic has changed the way we work, blurring 
what was already a hazy divide between life and work while raising questions 
around the long-term impacts on our mental wellness.”158 Of course, many 
managers and executives are dismissive of these claims. As David Solomon, CEO 
of Goldman Sachs, said: “It is not a new normal. It is an aberration that we are 
going to correct as quickly as possible.”159
Regardless, before the pandemic, employees viewed work–life balance as a 
unicorn or a life goal to aspire toward160—now, many are considering this old 
perspective to be problematic. Instead, many think of it as something much 
more flexible, enigmatic, and nebulous. From a view that work–life balance is 
like an achievement to aspire toward (enjoyed by the select few corner-office 
executives in the upper echelons), current thinking may be shifting toward con￾sidering it as a continuously balancing process. During this process, we remain 
self-aware, prioritize, and shuffle our demands and commitments in a way that 
meets our needs and that works for us.161
Work–Life Boundaries
The concepts of role conflict and COR theory are certainly relevant to work–
life issues because of our competing roles at work and home and our finite 
resources to address demands in each context. However, the concept of work–life 
boundaries (also sometimes called borders) is unique to research in this area.162

work–life conflict and 
work–life enrichment
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 643 13/12/22 3:25 AM644 PART 4 The Organization System
Work–life boundaries refer to the lines that demarcate our lives. We move and 
transition between these domains both physically and/or psychologically, and 
people, things, and communications from some domains can move across 
boundaries and serve as interruptions in our daily lives (e.g., your coworker call￾ing you on vacation or even stepping on your child’s LEGO right in the middle 
of a conference call).
At first glance, this may seem like a relatively simple concept. However, 
boundaries are complicated because people have preferences for how inte￾grated they want their work and home lives to be and how willing they are to 
“move” across domains (e.g., taking time off to deal with personal issues).163
Furthermore, people (and their job descriptions) are often limited in negotiat￾ing these boundaries (does the job allow flexibility and control of boundaries? 
or do they have to be in one space, free of interruptions, for extended peri￾ods?).164 Those who prefer or practice work–life integration tend to be more 
likely to move between domains easily (e.g., allowing friends to visit them while 
at work, answering work emails at home while preparing dinner, and frequently 
talking about their home lives at work and vice versa).165 On the other hand, 
those who prefer clear boundaries are more likely to maintain strong boundar￾ies and psychologically detach from one domain when in the other (e.g., turning 
their smartphone off once they are off the clock). Moreover, when employees 
engage in boundary management, they enact strategies or tactics to negotiate the 
time, space, and roles they play in each of the domains.166 These tactics can 
come in one of three forms: physical, behavioral, and psychological (examples 
are shown in Exhibit 18-6).
How well do people manage the boundaries between work–life domains? 
Employees high in the personality trait of conscientiousness (see the chapter on 
personality and individual differences) are more likely to perceive that they have 
greater boundary control and feel better equipped to manage cross-role inter￾ruptions. Those with low emotional stability, on the other hand, are more likely 
to view the cross-role interruptions as intrusive and stressful.167 Moreover, social 
identity also plays a role. Those who strongly identify with their family units tend 
to treat boundaries more strictly and as less permeable,168 looking to ensure 
permeability for the more valued domain while at the same time protecting it 
from intrusion from other domains.169 Finally, boundary management might be

a skill that gets better with age. Multiple studies among bank employees demon￾strate that older workers set and maintain stronger boundaries, which leads to 
better work–life balance.170
Regardless of traits, unwarranted interruptions in either domain (e.g., 
boundary violations) can result in frustration and other negative affective 
reactions.171 Moreover, research on (newly) remote workers during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and other employees with high technology demands 
suggests that employees with segmentation preferences who engaged in 
clear physical tactics (e.g., establishing explicit work spaces, turning their 
devices off during nonwork hours) achieved better work–life balance than 
other employees.172 A lack of boundaries also seems to matter: Work–life 
integration, for instance, has been shown to impair mental health because 
individuals do not have time to “recharge” from adverse experiences in 
either domain.173
Work–Life Spillover
In the prior section, we described how people set boundaries between their 
work and nonwork lives. Sometimes, elements from one domain will directly 
impact the domain we are currently in (e.g., a parent bringing you lunch at 
your office). However, sometimes the impact of one domain on another may 
be more subtle and psychological. For instance, work–life spillover occurs 
when our psychological responses to one domain (e.g., our positive or negative 
moods) are carried over into another domain and impact it in some way.174
For example, many people spend a lot of time commuting—about 27.6 min￾utes one-way in the United States. Moreover, about 5 percent of all U.S. work￾ers use some form of public transportation.175 The commute itself serves as a 
domain that can spill over to work or life domains (e.g., a bad traffic jam can 
leave you in a bad mood and late for work).176
Sometimes, the spillover we experience crosses over to other people.177 For 
instance, if you encountered several angry customers and big crowds at your 
movie theater in the afternoon, you may be more irritable and snap back at 
your friends when you hang out with them later. As we describe them, spillover 
and crossover can reverberate through a persons’ social network. For instance, 
let us say that an individual experiences a negative interaction with an abusive 
supervisor at work. Their negative emotions at home that have spilled over from 
work can cross over to their partner. Then their partner might experience spill￾over when they bring these negative emotions to their place of work.
Moreover, when we experience spillover (as conflict or enrichment), the 
experience can amplify attitudes toward both domains (see the chapter on job 
attitudes). In other words, receiving a long call from a supervisor right in the 
middle of a family reunion is likely to leave you dissatisfied with the time spent 
with your family (because of the interruption) and dissatisfied with your job 
(because of your displeasure at your supervisor’s call).178 In the sections that fol￾low, we discuss the positive (i.e., enrichment) and negative (i.e., conflict) forms 
of spillover in organizations.179
Work–Life Conflict Negative spillover (e.g., work–life conflict) grabbed man￾agement’s attention in the 1980s, largely due to the increased entry into the 
workforce of women with dependent children. In response, most major orga￾nizations took action to make their workplaces more family-friendly.180 They 
introduced onsite child care, summer day camps, flextime, job sharing, leave for 
school functions, telecommuting, and part-time employment. But organizations 
quickly realized negative spillover was something that affected all employees. 
work–life spillover When psychological 
responses to one domain (e.g., positive 
or negative moods) are carried over into 
another domain and impact it in some way.
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 645 13/12/22 3:25 AM646 PART 4 The Organization System
Heavy workloads and increased travel demands, for instance, made it increas￾ingly hard for parents to meet both work and personal responsibilities.
Reviews on work–life conflict suggest that it can be detrimental in several 
ways.181 It can negatively affect job attitudes and performance. It can even lead 
to more objective work outcomes, negatively impacting manager performance 
ratings and upward mobility (e.g., promotions).179 It can negatively affect home 
life by leading to poor life, leisure, family, and marital strain, and strain causes 
conflict.183
What causes work–life conflict? Typically, work factors tend to more 
strongly influence work spilling over to life, and life factors tend to more 
strongly influence life spilling over to work.184 Negative job attitudes, long 
hours, little support, inflexibility, and job stress lead to life conflict.185 On 
the other hand, family stress and interpersonal conflict, time spent caring for 
family members, and having young children are all associated with work con￾flict. Among these antecedents, stress experienced in either domain appears 
to be the biggest factor.186
Personality traits and individual differences also appear to matter. 
Employees low on emotional stability and high in negative affect (see the chap￾ters on personality and individual differences as well as emotion and mood) 
tend to perceive less work–life conflict.187 Moreover, employees who believe 
they have control over their circumstances and who are high in self-efficacy 
(see the chapters on motivation) are better able to handle the conflict.188
Considering gender, a vast amount of research suggests that gender does not 
influence the amount or degree of work–life conflict in either direction—
everyone experiences it. However, some research does support the notion 
that men spend more time at work and less time with their families and are 
perhaps not as good at establishing boundaries as women (leading to more 
conflict).186
Finally, the impact of work on the life domain does not appear to vary across 
cultures. However, the impact of life on the work domain does appear to vary by 
several cultural characteristics. Life-to-work conflict appears to be stronger in 
collectivist societies and those with larger economic gender gaps.190 However, 
the conflict tends to have less of an effect on work–family satisfaction in these 
societies.191 Moreover, work unit and family support appear to reduce the occur￾rence of work–life conflict in cultures that perceive support as a useful resource 
for people to draw upon.192
Work–Life Enrichment Work–family spillover also has a positive side.193 Jeff 
Bezos, Amazon chair and former CEO, once noted that if he was happy at home, 
he would bring tremendous energy with him into the office. Furthermore, if he 
was happy at work, he would also bring tremendous energy with him into his 
home life.194 Just as work and family life can cause conflict, so too may it cause 
enrichment. An excellent presentation, compliment from a customer, or raise 
from your supervisor can lead these positive experiences to spillover to other 
domains of your life. Similarly, a championship win for a weekend sports league, 
a mini-vacation to a fun destination, or even a romantic date night with a part￾ner can spill over to work.195
But what does the research say on enrichment? Unfortunately, con￾flict has been given much greater attention than enrichment. However, 
research does suggest that both types of enrichment (i.e., work-to-life and 
life-to-work) lead to positive job and life attitudes, increased engagement, 
decreased strain, better mental and physical health outcomes, and increased 
performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB).196 Moreover, 
just like work–life conflict, work variables tend to more strongly influence 
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 646 13/12/22 3:25 AMStress and Health in Organizations CHAPTER ­1 647
works enrichment of life, and life variables tend to more strongly influence 
life’s enrichment of work.197
Regarding predictors of enrichment, research suggests that both forms of 
enrichment are primarily the result of increased work engagement (maybe 
Bezos was on to something?). However, they are also a function of the social 
support received from family and coworkers and the degree of autonomy on the 
job.198 Just like with work–life conflict, personality also has an effect. However, 
different traits predict enrichment, including extroversion and openness to 
experience.199
Flexible and Supportive Policies
Time pressures are not the primary problem underlying work–life conflicts.200
The psychological incursion of work into the family domain—and vice versa—
leaves people worrying about personal problems at work and thinking about 
work problems at home, creating conflict. This suggests organizations should 
spend less effort helping employees with time management issues and more 
effort helping them segment their lives, navigate boundary transitions, and 
facilitate enrichment between both domains.
Flexible and supportive policies, such as keeping workloads reasonable, 
reducing work-related travel, and offering onsite high-quality child care, are 
examples of practices that can help in this endeavor.198 Leaders play a large 
role here—encouraging followers to use supportive policies (and playing a 
part in establishing them), establishing high-quality exchange relationships 
(LMX; see the chapter on leadership) with followers, and ultimately enabling 
followers in their pursuit of balance and boundary management.199 As a side 
note, positive leadership behaviors (e.g., servant leadership) themselves 
reduce stress and improve health outcomes on their own as well.203 In gen￾eral, perceptions of family-supportive leadership are more important than 
more general perceptions of perceived organizational and supervisor sup￾port (see the chapter on job attitudes) in reducing work–family conflict.204
Moreover, employees (especially cohabitating and parenting employees) 
tend to react positively to these policies, experiencing heightened job atti￾tudes as a result.205 In addition, following the spillover-crossover effects dis￾cussed in the previous section, these policies are so powerful that they can 
crossover and positively affect the employees’ partners and family members’ 
work and careers.206
Not surprisingly, people differ in their preference for scheduling options 
and benefits.207 Some prefer organizational initiatives that better segment work 
from personal life, like flextime, job sharing, and part-time hours. These initia￾tives allow employees to schedule work hours less likely to conflict with personal 
responsibilities. Others prefer initiatives that integrate work and personal life, 
such as gym facilities and company-sponsored family picnics. On average, most 
people prefer an organization that provides support for boundary management. 
Organizations are modifying their workplaces with scheduling options and ben￾efits to accommodate the varied needs of a diverse workforce. Employees at 
the SAS Institute have onsite child care, a health care and fitness center, and 
other firms offer perks ranging from flexible scheduling, supportive technol￾ogy, required vacation time, and remote work options.208 Slalom, number three 
in 2021 on Glassdoor’s Top Companies for Work–Life Balance list, offers guar￾anteed evenings free to spend as one sees fit.209 Exhibit 18-7 lists some other 
initiatives over the past decade that have helped employees reduce work–life 
conflicts, many of which have been described in-depth in the chapter on motiva￾tion application.

Managing Stress and Health
What should we do about stress? Should we do anything? Because low to mod￾erate amounts of challenging stressors can be functional and lead to higher 
performance, management may not be concerned when employees experience 
them; however, employees are likely to perceive even low levels of stress as unde￾sirable (or see the absence of a challenge as boring). What management consid￾ers “a positive stimulus that keeps the adrenaline running” could be very likely 
seen as “excessive pressure” by the employee.
18-6 Describe individual 
and organizational 
approaches to managing 
stress at work.
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 648 13/12/22 3:25 AMStress and Health in Organizations CHAPTER ­1 649
Regardless, stress can lead to poor outcomes that even managers should be 
aware of; for example, research on more than four thousand caregivers across 
thirty-five different hospitals suggested that during a typical twelve-hour shift with￾out breaks, hand-washing and safety compliance were reduced by 8.7 percent.210
Moreover, health and safety professionals suggest that there may be a need for man￾agement to be more hands-on. For instance, translating evidence-based health and 
safety innovation into practice is often glacially slow, merely presenting informa￾tion without telling people what to do with it. Poor implementation has often been 
deemed a waste of money when done incorrectly.211 Keep this example in mind as 
we discuss individual and organizational approaches toward managing stress.212
Individual Approaches
An employee can effectively take personal responsibility for managing their health 
and stress levels through coping practices and recovery experiences. Doing so can 
have a downstream effect on performance, OCB, CWB, attitudes, and health at 
work.213 Time management techniques, physical exercise, relaxation techniques, 
and social support networks are individual strategies that have proven effective.214
But before we proceed, it is important to note that the way you approach 
stress management matters: You should not necessarily be trying to actively pre￾vent or avoid stress, but instead, you should be trying to actively recover, relax, 
and refresh.215 Moreover, we are not introducing these individual approaches 
to suggest that the onus for stress management is entirely on employees—in 
fact, many of these individual approaches can be facilitated and enhanced by 
organizational policies that support these approaches.
Developing Time Management Skills Many people manage their time poorly. The 
well-organized employee may very well accomplish twice as much as the person 
who is poorly organized. For instance, research on university professors suggests 
that time management skills and decisions affect work–family balance, job atti￾tudes, and performance.216 Moreover, studies on elite athletes suggest they are 
experts in time management who continuously revisit their commitments and 
adapt to new demands (even when they are already strained and fatigued).217
A few of the best-known time management skills are: (1) staying organized 
through calendars, project management software, and to-do lists (schedule time 
for rest and recovery!); (2) prioritizing tasks, duties, and responsibilities (while 
working on [or delegating] them in order of priority); and (3) setting tempo￾rally realistic long- and short-term goals.218 On the other hand, the worst time 
management skills (which some people mythically associated with performing 
better) are (1) working faster and (2) working longer.219 Time management 
skills can help minimize procrastination by focusing efforts on immediate goals 
and boosting motivation even in the face of less enjoyable tasks.220 Furthermore, 
psychological techniques such as self-distancing from future stressors can help 
you adaptively cope with time pressure.221
Focusing on Mental Wellness and Physical Fitness Physicians have recommended 
noncompetitive physical exercise, such as aerobics, walking, jogging, swimming, 
and riding a bicycle, to deal with excessive stress levels and promote physical 
and mental health.222 These activities decrease the detrimental physiological 
responses to stress and allow us to recover from stress more quickly.223 The phys￾ical, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral benefits may translate into better per￾formance at work.221 Exercise can also help buffer the negative spillover effects 
of work–life conflict and improve work–life balance perceptions, even in the 
presence of poor sleep.225 Beyond its strain reduction benefits, physical exercise 
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 649 13/12/22 3:25 AM650 PART 4 The Organization System
can reduce the impact of others’ unethical or unfair behavior on you—and also 
make you less likely to be deviant yourself.226
Research shows that even low-intensity activity, such as walking in a park dur￾ing lunch,227 can improve moods along with other emotional benefits (even for 
people who doubt they will help).228 However, there is some credence to the 
notion of “no pain, no gain”: High-intensity exercise results in better recovery 
experiences (from work), reduced negative affect, and less rumination about 
stressors.229 Moreover, some research even suggests that physical fitness can 
help enhance intelligence and cognitive skills.
230
Many organizations offer wellness programs (which we discuss later) that 
promote physical fitness, but not all do. That is why employees may want to con￾sider establishing their own self-care routines. For instance, one might involve 
putting on some music (which may lead to better workouts);231 powering up 
an electronic activity tracker (which can reduce strain and increase control 
perceptions);232 unwinding with some exercise, maybe even with coworkers 
or friends;233 and rewarding yourself to keep coming back to the activity.234
However, everyone is different, and what works for one person may not work for 
another. Employees and supervisors must support one another and refrain from 
body-shaming or ostracism based on physical features.
Building Resilience Resilience involves resistance to the adverse effects of 
stress and strain.235 Resilience is especially important as a form of preparation 
for crises, like working remotely during the onset of a global pandemic to the 
sudden immersion in armed combat.233 Although research and practice differ 
in how they approach resilience, a recent approach has classified resilience 
skills as follows: (1) emotional resilience (e.g., fostering positive emotions, 
developing emotion regulation skills, and facilitating social connection); (2) 
resilient thinking (e.g., flexible thinking, optimistic perspective); and (3) bal￾ance and recovery abilities (e.g., self-care behavior, prioritizing and balancing 
demands).237
Outside of more extreme, stressful contexts, resilience can also be beneficial 
in employees’ day-to-day lives. For instance, through developing resilience, front￾line employees can better cope with customer incivility and mistreatment from 
coworkers and supervisors.238 Employees can also learn to weather the storms 
of interpersonal conflict through relationship resilience, learning to cope with let￾downs and disappointments in relationships, forgive one another for breaches of 
trust, and keep advocating for their needs without becoming defeated.239
Developing resilience is possible over time through practice, coaching, and 
training (although its effects tend to be more temporary than other individual 
approaches).240 Much research has demonstrated that resilience is very similar 
to stress management training. It can involve exposing employees to stressors 
so that they become accustomed to them.241 Otherwise, it can involve teaching 
employees self-regulation, stress management, and emotion regulation skills.239
In general, the stress management aspects of resilience training can have posi￾tive workplace outcomes, such as improved mental health and job satisfaction.243
Practicing Relaxation and Mindfulness Employees can teach themselves to 
reduce tension through relaxation techniques such as meditation, mindfulness, 
and deep breathing.241 The objective is to reach a state of deep physical relax￾ation, focusing all your energy on releasing muscle tension.245 Deep relaxation 
relieves strain;246 provides a pronounced sense of peacefulness; and produces 
significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological fac￾tors.247 Indeed, research reviews on thousands of employees suggest relaxation 
techniques can help manage stress and reduce burnout.245

Furthermore, the use of relaxation techniques during the day (and a lack of 
frustrating events) can help you relax when you get home—otherwise, you may 
have trouble doing so.249 Even very short microbreaks have been demonstrated to 
have an effect on employee stress relief and energy.250 You might be tempted to 
think that complete detachment from work, or rigid boundaries between your 
work and leisure life, is good; however, research suggests that those who are 
recovering ponderers, or who do not completely detach and ponder over prob￾lems they need to resolve at work (but still engage in relaxation activities), tend 
to both be engaged and experience a substantial decrease in stress.251 In other 
words, there may be some benefit to treating boundaries flexibly.
Another technique, mindfulness—receptively paying attention to and being 
aware of the present moment, events, and experiences—has become popular 
in organizations.252 (If you are interested in trying out mindfulness approaches 
for yourself, see the “Experiential Exercise” in the chapter on emotions and 
moods.) Mindfulness has roots in traditional Buddhist meditative techniques—
in fact, it is the literal translation of the Vedic word sati, or “intentness of 
mind.”253 Claims of the impact of mindfulness have been quite head-turning. 
For example, past research suggests that mindfulness can slow aging, bolster 
test performance, and facilitate neuroplasticity (i.e., producing actual changes 
in the brain).254 Moreover, there is reason to be skeptical.255 Many mindfulness 
studies do not agree about how they conceptualize mindfulness and do not use 
the best methodological practices and measures.256
Proponents of mindfulness suggest that the key mechanisms responsible for 
its effectiveness can be found in separating oneself from the moment, decreas￾ing the use of automatic thoughts, and increasing awareness of one’s own 
body.257 Moreover, forms of specialized mindfulness mediation for leaders have 
been suggested (which focuses on their reception, attention, and awareness to 
how they can improve the lives of themselves and others), with research show￾ing that leaders can experience better relationships, inner growth, enhanced 
well-being, and increased productivity as a result.255 Furthermore, some people 
are inherently “better” at mindfulness than others and tend to be more recep￾tive, attentive, and aware of the present moment as their “default mode.”257
These individuals tend to experience more positive motivational states and job 
attitudes on the job, less strain, and better performance.260

 Despite skepticism, the empirical research (outlandish linkages and claims aside) 
is quite promising. 261 For instance, mindfulness can help reduce unethical behavior—
even without any instruction to behave ethically—because it leads people to adopt a 
compassionate state. 262 Reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (a 
gold-standard methodology used in the medical field) found that mindfulness appre￾ciably reduced stress, anxiety, strain, psychological distress, chronic pain, depression 
relapse, and addiction—and improved well-being and sleep quality. 260 Through hun￾dreds of studies, it has also been linked to many other outcomes relevant for OB, 
including intrinsic motivation (although it can impair immediate task motivation) 264
and emotional regulation. 265 
Seeking Social Support As we have noted, friends, family, or work colleagues 
can provide an outlet when stress levels become excessive. Expanding your social 
support network enables you to find someone to hear your problems and offer a 
more objective perspective on a stressful situation (i.e., emotional support) or 
help you with some of your workload (i.e., instrumental support). 266 Research 
suggests that both emotional and instrumental support are highly related and 
just as effective at influencing important workplace outcomes— 267 although 
 An Ethical Choice 
 Talking About Mental Health Without 
Overstepping Boundaries 
Managers have a responsibility 
to create an inclusive and safe 
environment where employees 
feel that they can be their authentic 
selves. As research shows, feeling 
authentic at work ultimately leads 
to better performance, engagement, 
retention, and well-being. Employees 
want organizations to address mental 
health: For example, 86  percent of 
individuals surveyed believe that an 
organization’s culture should support 
mental health. However, talking about 
mental health, particularly at work, can 
feel daunting. Furthermore, it is easy 
for a cycle to set in where employees 
refrain from discussing mental health 
at work, leading to greater stigma￾tization of the topic. Unfortunately, 
roughly 60 percent of employees have 
never spoken to someone at work 
about their mental health status. For 
employees to break this cycle, issues 
surrounding mental health should be 
discussed and addressed proactively. 
 The question is how to go about 
discussing a sensitive topic without 
overstepping boundaries? Here are 
three practical steps: 
• Avoid trying to fix people. Although 
leaders are usually successful be￾cause they can solve difficult prob￾lems, if employees feel that you are 
attempting to “fix” them, your at￾tempts to offer help may backfire. 
They may feel less confident and 
begin to question their competence. 
Instead, provide employees with 
suggested resources or simply ask 
the employee, “What would be most 
helpful for you right now?” 
• Discuss health holistically. It prob￾ably seems normal to discuss the 
headaches you have been experi￾encing or your seasonal allergies 
with your coworker. However, dis￾cussing one’s mental health is often 
less common. Making an effort to 
ask about someone’s mental health 
can go a long way in normalizing this 
topic. Sharing your own struggles 
can also help create a more psycho￾logically safe environment in which 
your coworkers feel more comfort￾able being open about their own 
mental health. 
• Listen more than you talk. Active 
listening is not as easy as it may 
seem. The listening process is 
marred by the presence of biases, 
distractions, and judgments. Focus 
on your colleague’s experience and 
remember to separate it from your 
own. Rather than fixating on the de￾tails and how you might solve their 
problems, remember that you are 
there to support them and listen. 
Resist the urge to talk prescriptively . 
 Check-the-box solutions like emp￾loyee assistance programs (EAPs) 
are common but not enough when it 
comes to supporting employees’ men￾tal health. What employees really want 
is a more accepting and open culture 
that includes clearer information about 
the resources they can use when they 
need extra support. 274
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 652 13/12/22 3:25 AMStress and Health in Organizations CHAPTER ­1 653
who is providing support seems to make the difference (supervisors who are 
readily available to help are the most valuable).268
Sometimes, however, this emotional support produces the opposite effect:269
If you do not try to expand your network and instead ruminate with similarly 
stressed friends, you can get caught in a vicious cycle.270 That is why it is so 
important to be proactive and try to address your stress head-on. But apart from 
rumination, support from family, friends, or spouses who help you recover from 
stressful work experiences can be mutually beneficial.271 To give more effective 
social support to your peers and colleagues, try building others up, to help them 
understand their situation better and feel more capable of managing their situ￾ation.272 Moreover, some people are more receptive to “visible” social support 
than others (e.g., stubborn, independent people sometimes do not want to be 
helped despite needing it). If you can, you may be able to help them in an 
“invisible” way.273
Organizational Approaches
Several organizational factors that cause stress—particularly task and role 
demands—are controlled by management. Strategies worth considering include 
job (re)design, ensuring recovery experiences, and wellness programs.
(Re)designing Jobs Redesigning jobs to give employees more responsibility, 
more meaningful work, more autonomy, and increased feedback can reduce 
strain. Why? These factors give employees greater control over work activities, 
lessen their dependence on others, and demonstrate that the organization and 
its leadership care about employee well-being.275 In redesigning jobs, manag￾ers should pay attention to the specific tasks that may serve as (or preclude) 
stressors.276 For instance, one study of thousands of employees across multiple 
occupations demonstrated that jobs with irregular work schedules and conflic￾tual contact were those most prone to bullying. Managers could provide sup￾portive assistance to individuals in these jobs by designing some regularity in 
their schedules or alleviating the negative effects of the conflictual contact they 
experience.277 Moreover, some jobs that are boring or repetitive can be strain￾ing and harmful to performance over time—enabling some variety in what 
employees do (or even making jobs more “playful” or “fun”) can help solve 
these issues.278
One way to redesign jobs is to give employees control over the nature of 
their jobs (i.e., job crafting; see “Myth or Science?” in the chapter on motivation 
applications)275 or to come to unique, idiosyncratic deals with each employee 
about their tasks, duties, and responsibilities.280 This control and autonomy 
may be an additional necessary condition for mindfulness training to positively 
impact stress and health at work.281 However, managers should be vigilant and 
ensure that employees are not accepting too many challenges that could lead to 
burnout.282 Another way to redesign jobs would be to permit opportunities for 
employee training, development, and growth. Skill-enhancing job design prac￾tices influence job satisfaction, mental well-being, and the adoption of these 
skills to do their jobs more effectively.283
But as we noted in our discussion of work design, not all employees want 
enriched jobs. The right redesign for employees with a low need for growth 
might include less responsibility and increased specialization. If individuals pre￾fer structure and routine, reducing skill variety should reduce uncertainties and 
stress levels. Moreover, the wrong type of job redesign decision can actually back￾fire and lead to more strain.280 For instance, giving employees more responsibil￾ity for the outcomes of their work may cause proactive employees to burn out 
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 653 13/12/22 3:25 AM654 PART 4 The Organization System
while attempting to meet this “challenge.”285 Managers should closely examine 
the nature of any job design decisions and their effect on employees.286
Enabling a Remote Work Option As we noted earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic 
has led dozens of companies (e.g., Box, Shopify, Nationwide) to permanently go 
virtual (or partially; e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Hitachi).287 Indeed, most employ￾ees indicated that they would prefer to work from home at least part of the 
time.288 One study applied machine learning to compare 1.56 million tweets 
from before and after the onset of the pandemic, suggesting that public opin￾ion of remote work increased substantially.289
Although we described the newest research and perspectives on flexible work 
in the chapter on motivation applications, we bring up remote work here to make 
a point: just like in-person work, telecommuting has its own unique set of demands 
and stressors. For example, many people have reported experiencing videoconfer￾ence fatigue (e.g., “Zoom fatigue”) and other setbacks during the pandemic.290
Earlier in this chapter, we described how remote work can lead some toward height￾ened work–life integration and less segmentation, leading to more stress and burn￾out for some people. But if we are talking about whether the pros outweigh the 
cons, clearly, remote work has a more positive effect on work outcomes than some 
might think.291 Maybe employees who struggle with remote work need to learn how 
to do so effectively? And maybe jobs can be redesigned and resources provided to 
employees so that their home and life stressors can be reduced or removed?
Regardless, some people do not have the resources or skills to work remotely 
right away or in an effective manner. To confront the perils of excessive work–
life integration in remote work, organizations should be careful when deciding 
to structure work and organizations so that employees are on call twenty-four 
hours a day: workplace telepressure can impede the effectiveness of employee 
recovery experiences and increase stress.288
Offering Recovery Experiences All employees need an occasional escape from 
the frenetic pace of their work to recover from these experiences.293 However, in 
some countries, people perhaps do not seem to value recovery experiences as 
much as they should. For instance, the average American only uses about 54 per￾cent of their available time off every year, with only 28 percent of Americans 
using their full vacation days.294 Of course, the pandemic has made travel an 
exercise in caution.295 Still, many employees do not even take “staycations,” 
despite their increasing popularity.296
Why do some employees not use their vacation days? After all, research on peo￾ple looking back on the purchases that made them happy in their lives tend to cher￾ish their experiences more than things they bought.293 Researchers suggest several 
potential reasons. Apart from those who do not have the luxury of taking a vacation, 
many (1) feel like they cannot successfully detach (e.g., they will still have to “be on 
call” while away), (2) do not expect the vacation to result in positive outcomes (e.g., 
they will struggle relaxing or connecting with others), or (3) even expect negative 
outcomes (e.g., strain, negative financial impact) from taking a vacation.298
Are these concerns warranted? Some research on hundreds of teachers on 
mid-term vacations (e.g., fall or spring breaks) found perfectionist teachers 
tended to have trouble fully relaxing on vacation and continued to feel emotion￾ally exhausted, mostly due to negative spillover and taking work on vacation with 
them. However, perfectionist teachers realized the full benefits of the vacation if 
they refrained from taking work with them (and just left those papers ungraded 
for their vacation).299 Despite these occurrences, vacations reduce strain and 
result in heightened well-being. However, the effects tend to fade as the employee 
returns to work. Moreover, if the “back to work” workload is very high, it may be 
a jarring shock that leads the employee to return to pre-vacation stress levels.300
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 654 13/12/22 3:25 AMStress and Health in Organizations CHAPTER ­1 655
Although most companies offer vacation leave, many companies, includ￾ing Charles Schwab, Adobe, Intel, Epic, PayPal, Deloitte, Autodesk, Biogen, 
and Genentech, have begun to provide extended, voluntary leaves.301 These 
sabbaticals—ranging in length from a few weeks to several months—allow 
employees to travel, relax, or pursue personal projects that consume time 
beyond normal vacations. One study of university faculty members sug￾gests that sabbaticals increase job resources and well-being, especially 
when they have greater autonomy in how they spend their sabbatical.298
Moreover, employees from a small manufacturing company who took sab￾baticals described that the sabbatical was a way for them to “find themselves” 
and “discover who they are,” contributing to the construction of a positive 
self-identity.303
In general, the research suggests organizations should encourage employees 
to rest and recover. Also, they should encourage employees to set clear bound￾aries between work and life and ease the transitions surrounding vacation time 
and work time.
Wellness Programs Our final suggestion is organizationally supported employee 
assistance programs (EAPs), work–life programs, or wellness programs. (Note 
that many have argued that these programs should be integrated and consid￾ered under the same umbrella, although there are some differences.)304 These 
are organizationally supported programs that focus on the employees’ total 
physical and mental health.305 They typically provide workshops to help peo￾ple quit smoking, control alcohol use, lose weight, make healthier food and 
drink choices, and develop a regular exercise program.306 Some programs help 
employees improve their psychological health as well. Most wellness programs 
attempt to equip employees with what they need to take responsibility for their 
physical and mental health. In essence, participation in a wellness program can 
replenish employee resources (consistent with COR theory), leading them to 
start a continuous, upward trajectory of improvement.307

Corporate wellness programs can

As part of its wellness and fitness 
initiatives, the Buchanan Ingersoll 
& Rooney law firm (formerly Fowler 
White Boggs) brings in yoga instruc￾tors during employees’ lunch hours to 
lead them in stretching and breathing 
exercises that help relieve stress and 
promote a sense of well-being.
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 655 13/12/22 3:25 AM656 PART 4 The Organization System
Do wellness programs work? A meta-analysis of thirty-six programs designed 
to reduce stress (including wellness programs) showed that interventions to 
help employees reframe stressful situations and use active coping strategies 
appreciably reduced stress levels.308 Wellness programs that help employ￾ees focus on developing the “good” kind of stress and becoming challenged 
through their work have also been introduced.309 Research suggests that these 
programs impact factors beyond stress relevant to OB, such as job satisfaction, 
absenteeism, and presenteeism.310 However, research also suggests that wellness 
programs are only effective if people use them. Employees have to see the value 
in the wellness program, know their supervisor supports their participation, 
believe that their organization supports their continued wellness and is a safe 
place to seek help without stigma. If they do, they can leave the program with 
better performance, higher job satisfaction, and lower turnover intentions.311
Most firms that have introduced wellness programs have found significant 
benefits. Johnson & Johnson reported that its wellness program has saved the 
organization $250 million on health care costs in ten years, and research indi￾cated that effective wellness programs significantly decreased turnover rates for 
most organizations.312 Other research sponsored by the U.S. Department of 
Labor and Department of Health and Human Services indicated that organi￾zational wellness programs create healthier employees with fewer health risk 
factors.313 Moreover, the accumulated research suggests that organizations that 
implement wellness programs (1) observe a $5.93 to $1.00 savings-to-cost ratio, 
(2) reduce health costs by 26 percent, (3) reduce workers’ compensation claims 
by 30  percent, and (4) observe a 28  percent reduction in sick days used.314
However, as mentioned earlier, workers’ benefits from these programs appear 
contingent on how much they put into the program, the extent to which they 
participate, and their attitudes upon entering the program.315
Summary
The issues of health and stress in organizations have presented themselves as a 
major public crisis worldwide. As employees work themselves to the core, with￾out respite or concern for the consequences, millions of dollars are spent in 
costs, productivity is lost, and more importantly, employees risk serious injury, 
illness, and even death. In this chapter, we described the nature of stress in 
organizations. More specifically, the experience of stress results in the additive 
exposure to stressors, and this experience of stress results in strain (e.g., physio￾logical, psychological, and behavioral consequences). Although stressors them￾selves can be seen as either positive (e.g., eustress, challenges) or negative (e.g., 
hindrances), the experience of strain can result from both types. Importantly, 
the experience of stress has important implications for both physical and mental 
health. OB researchers and practitioners have become increasingly concerned 
with physical health issues in the workplace, such as employee sleep, presentee￾ism, and the risk factors that cause illness and injury. Mental health is also a 
concern, with OB researchers and practitioners focusing on job insecurity as 
a stressor, workaholism in the modern workforce, and psychological distress is￾sues at work (e.g., burnout and depression). After establishing this foundation, 
we put the pieces together and describe four primary theories governing our 
understanding of stress in organizations. Then we move toward describing one 
especially salient topic in organizations: the issue of work–life balance. We de￾scribe whether we are really confronting a “new normal” in the way we perceive 
work and life, the boundaries we establish between our various life domains, 
and the spillover and crossover (both positive and negative) that occur between 
M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 656 13/12/22 3:25 AMStress and Health in Organizations CHAPTER ­1 657
domains. Importantly, management plays a large role in facilitating employees’ 
strategies for managing these boundaries and domains. We close the chapter by 
discussing both individual and organization-level approaches to stress manage￾ment in organizations, along with best practices for managing stress.
Implications for Managers
● Both stress and health have substantial legal, financial, and effectiveness 
implications—managers would do well to have a stress and health man￾agement strategy.
● Resist the temptation to consider stress as uniformly a challenging, pro￾ductive, “good” feeling.
● Encourage employees to proactively and constructively manage their health 
by getting enough good quality sleep and staying home and resting when 
they have contagious illnesses (or if their performance could be affected).
● Although job insecurity cannot be avoided, recognize its effect on em￾ployees as a stressor. Drastic cost-cutting measures like downsizing can re￾duce morale through its effect on job insecurity.
● To reduce burnout and other psychological distress, discourage workahol￾ism and encourage employees to focus on their health and safety as major 
priorities.
● When addressing health issues in your organization, consider the effects 
that demands and resources have on the experience of strain and engage￾ment, along with the factors that can help (e.g., control, support).
● Although no one knows how work–life balance will be treated in the fu￾ture, it is clear that boundaries, segmentation, integration, spillover, and 
crossover have major implications in the workplace. The best thing man￾agers can do would be to provide flexibility, enrichment (when desired), 
and boundary management support to employees as much as they can.
● Although there are several stress management approaches at organiza￾tional levels (e.g., job redesign and recovery provision), leaders and 
managers can play a role at all levels by establishing support systems, pro￾grams, and training that encourages employees to manage their stress lev￾els through individual-level approaches.

 Companies Should Encourage Stress Reduction 
POINT 
C
ompanies make substantial investments in their employees, so 
the health and well-being of the workforce is a central concern. 
One of the most direct ways to provide assistance to employees 
is to engage in one of the stress-reduction interventions. 
 One major financial benefit of stress reduction programs is a re￾duction in health-related costs. Workplace stress leads to dozens of 
negative and expensive health-related consequences. Stress weakens 
the immune system, leading to increased illness and sick days. If em￾ployees feel extreme stress related to work, they may be more likely 
to come to work when they are contagious, leading to sickness for 
many others. Over the longer run, stress levels can also contribute to 
conditions like heart disease, which ultimately result in very expen￾sive medical treatments. These medical treatments increase employer 
health insurance expenses. 
 Reductions in employee stress can facilitate job performance. 
Employees who are overburdened have difficulty concentrating, can 
lose energy and motivation at work, and find it difficult to think of new 
and creative ideas. Stress can also create conflicts with coworkers and 
lead to rude or hostile treatment of clients or customers. Ultimately, 
employees who are experiencing high levels of stress may leave, so all 
the costs of turnover are incurred. 
 Stress reduction programs also have an ethical component. 
The workplace generates a great deal of stress for many employ￾ees, so employers have a certain responsibility to offset its negative 
 consequences. Stress reduction programs are a direct way to help 
employees feel better. When employers show concern for employees 
by helping reduce stress, employees feel more committed. 
COUNTERPOINT 
While employers may have a direct financial interest in certain 
elements of stress reduction, it is worth asking whether in￾vesting in stress reduction programs is actually a good idea. 
 The first problem is operational. Some stress reduction interven￾tions are expensive, requiring professional facilitators or exercise 
equipment. These can take a long time to show financial returns, and 
the up-front costs of researching, designing, and implementing them 
are substantial. A growing number of corporations report that the 
expected returns on investment in wellness programs have failed to 
materialize. And the time employees spend in stress reduction inter￾ventions is time they spend not working. 
 Another problem is that stress reduction programs are invasive. 
Should your boss or other individuals in the workplace tell you how 
you are supposed to feel? Many stress reduction programs step even 
further into employees’ personal lives by encouraging open discus￾sions about sources of stress. Do you really want your manager and 
coworkers to know why you are experiencing stress? The more that 
sensitive topics related to stress are discussed, the harder it is to keep 
work relationships professional. 
 A final concern is that it is too hard to draw the line between stress 
from work and general life stress. A company’s stress reduction pro￾gram may try to target problems of work overload or social conflict, but 
these issues often affect other areas of life. How should a stress re￾duction program operate when the reasons for employee stress come, 
say, from a sick relative or conflicts with family members? 
 Organizations often mean well, but it may be more important to let 
employees keep their private lives private. 316

APPLICATION AND EMPLOYABILITY
In this chapter, you were introduced to the impact of 
stress and health in organizations. You learned about sev￾eral techniques to manage your stress levels. Knowing how 
to manage your stress levels can help you become more 
employable because you will be equipped to manage your 
stress and health and perhaps perform better as a result. 
Also, challenging stressors and goals can help motivate 
you and lead to great accomplishments. If you find your￾self managing people someday, you have learned various 
options for helping your employees manage their stress 
levels. In this chapter, you have improved your social re￾sponsibility skills, critical thinking, creativity, leadership, 
and career management skills by becoming aware of the 
dangers of a lack of sleep, learning how to talk about men￾tal health without overstepping boundaries, considering 
how to help gig workers who are faced with job insecu￾rity and other stressors, and debated whether companies 
should be involved in stress reduction efforts. In the next 
section, you will continue to build these skills by develop￾ing an awareness of micro-stressors in your life, consider￾ing the negative effects of presenteeism, and considering 
what to do when working for a company that offers health￾friendly benefits (but with a culture that discourages their 
use).
EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISE Micro-Stressors
Many of us have days when we go home exhausted and 
end up having a restless night of sleep. While you may 
be able to identify what is causing your exhaustion, 
you may not realize that throughout the day, we often 
experience small amounts of stress, otherwise known 
as “micro-stressors,” that can together hurt our health 
and productivity. Unfortunately, we often accept micro￾stressors as just part of a typical day. Although we may not 
acknowledge them, they are still contributing to exhaus￾tion and may ultimately lead to burnout. The sources of 
these micro-stressors are usually the people (both at and 
outside work) with whom we are closest. The first step in 
resolving these sources of stress is to identify them.
For this exercise, your task is to select two or three 
micro-stressors that consistently create the greatest amount 
of stress for you out of the twelve common micro-stressors 
shown in the chart on the following page. Then answer 
the questions that follow.

ETHICAL DILEMMA The Fear of Redundancy and Ceasing Operations
Leading universities in the United Kingdom (includ￾ing the University of Manchester and the University of 
Birmingham), renowned charter and low-cost airlines 
in Europe (such as Monarch, Air Berlin, and easyJet), 
colossal banks (such as the HSBC), iconic department 
stores (such as British Home Stores), and the Sheffield￾based Outokumpu steel company—all have faced financial 
troubles and strains on their existence. As the companies

have struggled, so have the people who worked for them. 
This is because some of these companies have ceased op￾erations and trading while others have announced massive 
redundancies in anticipation of economic struggle and 
uncertainty, political instability or industry decline, or even 
unexpected increases in operating costs, all of which have 
led to employee layoffs.
In the cases of easyJet, Manchester University, 
Birmingham University, and Outokumpu, thousands of 
employees were made redundant within a short period 
of time. Some of these were introduced as planned and 
incremental changes, but most of these changes were 
abrupt, drastic, and rather forced, causing a shock to 
the workforce staff. Situations like this constitute a stress￾ful situation for both the management and the employ￾ees, as they can challenge trust relations and jeopardize 
individual and group performance as well as disrupt and 
confuse the group dynamics in many ways. Redundancy 
can also impede motivation for the staff remaining in 
their posts and generate stress for both those being made 
redundant as well as those who have to pick up after the 
former—not an easily accepted situation for those leaving 
or those remaining. In the new responsibilities and the 
workload, the remaining staff are also left worrying about 
their own future. In both cases, the stress created needs 
to be managed in the best possible manner. Support, 
mentoring, and consultations are vital for enhancing the 
skills and knowledge required in the new state of affairs as 
well as enhancing employee morale. Additionally, change 
needs to be planned and prepared to the extent possible, 
rather than carrying it out abruptly and at the expense of 
employees.318

CASE INCIDENT Burnout Despite Flexibility: Working Parents and COVID-19
In the months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pan￾demic, it became apparent that the experiences of different 
categories of workers were very varied. One example is work￾ing parents who were forced to begin working from home. 
At the start of the pandemic, many governments around 
the world introduced lockdown policies to curb the spread 
of the virus such as mandatory work-from-home rules and 
closure of schools and child care facilities. Though it might 
feel like parents in office jobs should be considered lucky to 
be able to work from home, studies show that burnout was a 
huge issue for this category of employees.
While working parents always had to do some work–life 
juggling, the prolonged closure of child care facilities and 
schools and the loss of family support networks due to 
movement restrictions meant that the demand on working 
parents’ time was unprecedented. In March 2020, around 
1.4 billion children were out of school worldwide, and 
worrying reports of severe stress and anxiety among work￾ing parents began to emerge, then progressively increase. 
Homeschooling the children while trying to focus on a bal￾ance sheet, rocking a baby, keeping a toddler quiet during 
Zoom meetings, cooking extra meals, cleaning extra messes, 
working into the early hours to meet work deadlines—all of 
these, in addition to health risks and economic uncertainty, 
resulted in significantly higher stress. Parents reported feel￾ing loss of control, emotional exhaustion, fatigue, and disen￾gagement, which are all symptomatic of burnout. Mothers 
in particular were badly affected. UK statistics, for instance, 
show that they spent four more hours on child care and 
housework compared to fathers with the same work arrange￾ments, a pattern shaped by the persistence of traditional 
gender roles. The situation was also exacerbated for those 
with lower incomes, limited living space, younger children, 
and children with special needs or additional health con￾cerns. Research shows similar patterns of parental burnout 
in various European countries, the United States, Canada, 
Australia, as well as Asian and Middle Eastern countries, with 
studies conducted in India, Malaysia, Japan, and Iran.
Many organizations supported parents by allowing 
greater flexibility of work hours and by letting parents fit 
their work around child care. However, flexibility often 
meant working late and untimely hours, resulting in physi￾cal fatigue and exhaustion. One mother said that after her 
children were in bed at 9.30 p.m., she would be at work 
on her laptop, finishing everything she couldn’t during the 
day, closing up at about 2 a.m. Many companies also tried 
to go the extra mile by offering various online wellness 
programs, well-being training, mindfulness and resilience 
sessions, online yoga, and so on. Though helpful for some 
categories of employees, few parents report as having taken 
advantage of these; as work intensity and target pressures 
often remained the same, this was not the best solution. 
Research shows that flexible work and homeworking gen￾erally increases employee productivity and satisfaction and 
should by all means be part of the organizational commitment 
to employee well-being and work–life balance. However, in 
the circumstances of the pandemic, flexibility of working time 
alone was not enough, and rethinking what may work dur￾ing a crisis is crucial. Recent research also suggests that, after 
several years of physical disconnect from the workplace and 
colleagues during the pandemic, framing wellness interven￾tions around individuals and self-care may not be as effective. 
Instead, focusing programs on getting team members to take 
care of each other and working through struggles together 
may be a more effective solution. This may be beneficial 
across many categories of workers, and for working parents in 
particular, because understanding and working through team 
members’ circumstances may increase knowledge-sharing, 
empathy, and team resilience (the ability and capacity of 
teams to respond to and cope with disruption and change in 
an effective and flexible manner). These kinds of approaches 
to well-being may remain relevant in the long term, as many 
international companies, such as Google and Spotify, are 
either contemplating or have already switched to a blend of 
remote and hybrid working for the foreseeable future.319

M18_ROBB0025_19_GE_C18.indd 661 13/12/22 3:25 AMAppendix Research in Organizational Behavior
A number of years ago, a friend of mine was excited 
because he had read about the findings from a research 
study that finally, once and for all, resolved the question 
of what it takes to make it to the top in a large corpora￾tion. I doubted there was any simple answer to this ques￾tion, but not wanting to dampen his enthusiasm, I asked 
him to tell me about what he had read. The answer, ac￾cording to my friend, was participation in college athletics. 
To say I was skeptical of his claim is a gross understate￾ment, so I asked him to tell me more.
The study encompassed 1,700 successful senior 
executives at the 500 largest U.S. corporations. The 
researchers found that half of these executives had 
played varsity-level college sports.1
 My friend, who hap￾pens to be good with statistics, informed me that since 
fewer than 2 percent of all college students participate 
in intercollegiate athletics, the probability of this finding 
occurring by mere chance is less than 1 in 10 million! He 
concluded his analysis by telling me that, based on this 
research, I should encourage my management students 
to get into shape and to make one of the varsity teams.
My friend was somewhat perturbed when I sug￾gested that his conclusions were likely to be flawed. 
These executives were all men who attended college 
in the 1940s and 1950s. Would his advice be meaning￾ful to students in the twenty-first century? These exec￾utives also were not your typical college students. For 
the most part, they had attended elite private colleges 
such as Princeton and Amherst, where a large propor￾tion of the student body participates in intercollegiate 
sports. And these CEOs had not necessarily played 
football or basketball; many had participated in golf, 
tennis, baseball, cross-country running, crew, rugby, 
and similar so-called minor sports. Moreover, maybe 
the researchers had confused the direction of causal￾ity. That is, maybe individuals with the motivation and 
ability to make it to the top of a large corporation are 
drawn to competitive activities like college athletics.
My friend was guilty of misusing research data. Of 
course, he is not alone. We are all continually bombarded 
with reports of experiments that link certain substances to 
cancer in mice and surveys that show changing attitudes 
toward sex among college students, for example. Many 
of these studies are carefully designed, with great caution 
taken to note the implications and limitations of the find￾ings. But some studies are poorly designed, making their 
conclusions at best suspect, and at worst meaningless.
Rather than attempting to make you a researcher, the 
purpose of this appendix is to increase your awareness 
as a consumer of behavioral research. A knowledge of 
research methods will allow you to appreciate more fully 
the care in data collection that underlies the informa￾tion and conclusions presented in this text. Moreover, an 
understanding of research methods will make you a more 
skilled evaluator of the OB studies you will encounter in 
business and professional journals. So, an appreciation 
of behavioral research is important because (1) it is the 
foundation on which the theories in this text are built, 
and (2) it will benefit you in future years when you read 
reports of research and attempt to assess their value.
Purposes of Research
Research is concerned with the systematic gathering of 
information. Its purpose is to help us in our search for 
the truth. Although we will never find ultimate truth—in 
our case, that would be to know precisely how any person 
or group would behave in any organizational context—
ongoing research adds to our body of OB knowledge 
by supporting some theories, contradicting others, and 
suggesting new theories to replace those that fail to gain 
support.
Research Terminology
Researchers have their own vocabulary for communicat￾ing among themselves and with outsiders. The follow￾ing briefly defines some of the more popular terms you 
are likely to encounter in behavioral science studies.2
Variable
A variable is any general characteristic that can be mea￾sured and that changes in amplitude, intensity, or both. 
Some examples of OB variables found in this textbook 
are job satisfaction, employee productivity, work stress, 
ability, personality, and group norms.
Hypothesis
A tentative explanation of the relationship between two or 
more variables is called a hypothesis. My friend’s statement 
that participation in college athletics leads to a top 
executive position in a large corporation is an example 
662
Z01_ROBB0025_19_GE_APP.indd 662 13/12/22 3:28 AMAPPENDIX Research in Organizational Behavior 663
of a hypothesis. Until confirmed by empirical research, a 
hypothesis remains only a tentative explanation.
Dependent Variable
A dependent variable is a response that is affected by an in￾dependent variable. In terms of the hypothesis, it is the 
variable that the researcher is interested in explaining. 
Referring back to our opening example, the dependent 
variable in my friend’s hypothesis was executive succession. 
In organizational behavior research, the most popular de￾pendent variables are productivity, absenteeism, turnover, 
job satisfaction, and organizational commitment.3
Independent Variable
An independent variable is the presumed cause of some 
change in the dependent variable. Participating in varsi￾ty athletics was the independent variable in my friend’s 
hypothesis. Popular independent variables studied by 
OB researchers include intelligence, personality, job 
satisfaction, experience, motivation, reinforcement 
patterns, leadership style, reward allocations, selection 
methods, and organization design.
You may have noticed that we said that job satis￾faction is frequently used by OB researchers as both a 
dependent and an independent variable. This is not an 
error. It merely reflects that the label given to a variable 
depends on its place in the hypothesis. In the statement 
“Increases in job satisfaction lead to reduced turnover,” 
job satisfaction is an independent variable. However, in 
the statement “Increases in money lead to higher job sat￾isfaction,” job satisfaction becomes a dependent variable.
Moderating Variable
A moderating variable abates the effect of the indepen￾dent variable on the dependent variable. It might also 
be thought of as the contingency variable: If X (inde￾pendent variable), then Y (dependent variable) will oc￾cur, but only under conditions Z (moderating variable). 
To translate this into a real-life example, we might say 
that if we increase the amount of direct supervision in 
the work area (X ), then there will be a change in work￾er productivity (Y ), but this effect will be moderated by 
the complexity of the tasks being performed (Z ).
Causality
A hypothesis, by definition, implies a relationship. That 
is, it implies a presumed cause and effect. This direc￾tion of cause and effect is called causality. Changes in 
the independent variable are assumed to cause changes 
in the dependent variable. In behavioral research, how￾ever, it is possible to make an incorrect assumption of 
causality when relationships are found. For example, 
early behavioral scientists found a relationship between 
employee satisfaction and productivity. They concluded 
that a happy worker was a productive worker. Follow￾up research has supported the relationship, but discon￾firmed that high productivity leads to satisfaction rather 
than the other way around.
Correlation Coefficient
It is one thing to know that there is a relationship be￾tween two or more variables. It is another to know the 
strength of that relationship. The term correlation coeffi￾cient is used to indicate that strength, and it is expressed 
as a number between –1.00 (a perfect negative relation￾ship) and +1.00 (a perfect positive correlation).
When two variables vary directly with one another, 
the correlation will be expressed as a positive number. 
When they vary inversely—that is, one increases as the 
other decreases—the correlation will be expressed 
as a negative number. If the two variables vary inde￾pendently of each other, we say that the correlation 
between them is zero.
For example, a researcher might survey a group of 
employees to determine the satisfaction of each with 
their job. Then, using company absenteeism reports, 
the researcher could correlate the job satisfaction scores 
against individual attendance records to determine 
whether employees who are more satisfied with their jobs 
have better attendance records than their counterparts 
who indicated lower job satisfaction. Let us suppose the 
researcher found a correlation coefficient of +0.50 between 
satisfaction and attendance. Would that be a strong associ￾ation? There is, unfortunately, no precise numerical cutoff 
separating strong and weak relationships. A standard statis￾tical test would need to be applied to determine whether 
the relationship was a significant one.
A final point needs to be made before we move on: 
A correlation coefficient measures only the strength of 
association between two variables. A high value does 
not imply causality. The number of computer science 
doctorates and total revenue generated by arcades, for 
instance, have been highly correlated over the decades, 
but one should be careful not to infer that a causal rela￾tionship between the two exists. In this instance, the 
high correlation is more happenstance than predictive.
Theory
The final term we introduce in this section is theory. The￾ory describes a set of systematically interrelated concepts 
or hypotheses that purports to explain and predict phe￾nomena. In OB, theories are also frequently referred to 
as models. We use the two terms interchangeably.
There are no shortages of theories in OB. For 
instance, we have theories to describe what motivates 
people, the most effective leadership styles, the best 
way to resolve conflicts, and how people acquire power. 
In some cases, we have half a dozen or more separate 
theories that purport to explain and predict a given 
phenomenon. In such cases, is one right and the oth￾ers wrong? No! They tend to reflect science at work—
researchers testing previous theories; modifying them; 
and, when appropriate, proposing new models that 
may prove to have higher explanatory and predictive 
powers. Multiple theories attempting to explain com￾mon phenomena merely attest to the fact that OB is an 
active discipline, still growing and evolving.

Evaluating Research
As a potential consumer of behavioral research, you 
should follow the dictum of caveat emptor—let the buyer 
beware! In evaluating any research study, you need to 
ask three questions.4
Is it valid? Is the study actually measuring what it 
claims to be measuring? A number of psychological 
tests have been discarded by employers in recent years 
because they have not been found to be valid measures 
of the applicants’ ability to do a given job successfully. 
But the validity issue is relevant to all research studies. 
So, if you find a study that links cohesive work teams 
with higher productivity, you want to know how each of 
these variables was measured and whether it is actually 
measuring what it is supposed to be measuring.
Is it reliable? Reliability refers to consistency of measure￾ment. If you were to have your height measured every 
day with a wooden yardstick, you would get highly reli￾able results. On the other hand, if you were measured 
each day by an elastic tape measure, there would probably 
be considerable disparity between your height measure￾ments from one day to the next. Your height, of course, 
does not change from day to day. The variability is due to 
the unreliability of the measuring device. So, if a company 
asked a group of its employees to complete a reliable job 
satisfaction questionnaire and then repeat the question￾naire six months later, we would expect the results to be 
very similar—provided nothing changed in the interim 
that might significantly affect employee satisfaction.
Is it generalizable? Are the results of the research 
study generalizable to groups of individuals other 
than those who participated in the original study? Be 
aware, for example, of the limitations that might exist 
in research that uses college students as subjects. Are 
the findings in such studies generalizable to full-time 
employees in real jobs? Similarly, how generalizable to 
the overall work population are the results from a study 
that assesses job stress among ten nuclear power plant 
engineers in the hamlet of Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia?
Research Design
Doing research is an exercise in trade-offs. Richness 
of information typically comes with reduced gener￾alizability. The more a researcher seeks to control for 
confounding variables, the less realistic their results 
are likely to be. High precision, generalizability, and 
control almost always translate into higher costs. When 
researchers make choices about whom they will study, 
where their research will be done, the methods they will 
use to collect data, and so on, they must make some 
concessions. Good research designs are not perfect, but 
they do carefully reflect the questions being addressed. 
Keep these facts in mind as we review the strengths and 
weaknesses of five popular research designs: case stud￾ies, field surveys, laboratory experiments, field experi￾ments, and aggregate quantitative reviews.
Case Study
You pick up a copy of Soichiro Honda’s autobiography. 
In it he describes his impoverished childhood; his de￾cisions to open a small garage, assemble motorcycles, 
and eventually build automobiles; and how this led to 
the creation of one of the largest and most successful 
corporations in the world. Or you are in a business class 
and the instructor distributes a 50-page handout cover￾ing two companies: Walmart and Target. The handout 
details the two firms’ histories; describes their corporate 
strategies, management philosophies, and merchandis￾ing plans; and includes copies of their recent balance 
sheets and income statements. The instructor asks the 
class members to read the handout, analyze the data, 
and determine why Walmart has been more successful 
than Target in recent years.
Soichiro Honda’s autobiography and the Walmart 
and Target handouts are case studies. Drawn from real￾life situations, case studies present an in-depth analysis 
of one setting. They are thorough descriptions, rich in 
details about an individual, a group, or an organization. 
The primary source of information in case studies is 
obtained through observation, occasionally backed up 
by interviews and a review of records and documents.
Case studies have their drawbacks. They are open 
to the perceptual bias and subjective interpretations of 
the observer. The reader of a case is captive to what the 
observer/case writer chooses to include and exclude. 
Cases also trade off generalizability for depth of infor￾mation and richness of detail. Because it is always dan￾gerous to generalize from a sample of one, case studies 
make it difficult to prove or reject a hypothesis. On the 
other hand, you cannot ignore the in-depth analysis 
that cases often provide. They are an excellent device 
for initial exploratory research and for evaluating real￾life problems in organizations.
Field Survey
A lengthy questionnaire was created to assess the use 
of ethics policies, formal ethics structures, formalized 
activities such as ethics training, and executive involve￾ment in ethics programs among billion-dollar corpora￾tions. The public affairs or corporate communications 
office of all Fortune 500 industrial firms and 500 service 
corporations were contacted to get the name and ad￾dress of the “officer most responsible for dealing with 
ethics and conduct issues” in each firm. The question￾naire, with a cover letter explaining the nature of the 
study, was mailed to these 1,000 officers. Of the total, 
254 returned a completed questionnaire, for a response 
rate just above 25 percent. The results of the survey 
found, among other things, that 77 percent had formal 
codes of ethics and 54 percent had a single officer spe￾cifically assigned to deal with ethics and conduct issues.5
The preceding study illustrates a typical field survey. 
A sample of respondents (in this case, 1,000 corporate 
officers in the largest U.S. publicly held corporations) 
was selected to represent a larger group that was under 
examination (billion-dollar U.S. business firms). The 
Z01_ROBB0025_19_GE_APP.indd 664 13/12/22 3:28 AMAPPENDIX Research in Organizational Behavior 665
respondents were then surveyed using a questionnaire 
or interviewed to collect data on specific characteris￾tics (the content and structure of ethics programs and 
practices) of interest to the researchers. The standard￾ization of response items allows for data to be easily 
quantified, analyzed, and summarized, and for the 
researchers to make inferences from the representa￾tive sample about the larger population.
The field survey provides economies for doing 
research. It is less costly to sample a population than 
to obtain data from every member of that population. 
(There are, for instance, hundreds to thousands of U.S. 
firms with revenues in excess of a billion dollars; some 
of these are privately held and do not release finan￾cial data to the public, and they are excluded from the 
Fortune list.) Moreover, as the ethics study illustrates, 
field surveys provide an efficient way to find out how 
people feel about issues or how they say they behave. 
These data can then be easily quantified.
But the field survey has a number of potential weak￾nesses. First, mailed questionnaires rarely obtain 100 
percent returns. Low response rates call into question 
whether conclusions based on respondents’ answers 
are generalizable to nonrespondents. Second, the for￾mat is better at tapping respondents’ attitudes and per￾ceptions than behaviors. Third, responses can suffer 
from social desirability, that is, people saying what they 
think the researcher wants to hear. Fourth, because 
field surveys are designed to focus on specific issues, 
they are a relatively poor means of acquiring depth of 
information. Finally, the quality of the generalizations 
is largely a factor of the population chosen. Responses 
from executives at Fortune 500 firms, for instance, tell 
us nothing about small- or medium-sized firms or non￾profit organizations. In summary, even a well-designed 
field survey trades off depth of information for breadth, 
generalizability, and economic efficiencies.
Laboratory Experiment
The following study is a classic example of the laboratory 
experiment. A researcher, Stanley Milgram, wondered 
how far individuals would go in following commands. If 
subjects were placed in the role of a teacher in a learn￾ing experiment and told by an experimenter to admin￾ister a shock to a learner each time that learner made 
a mistake, would the subjects follow the commands of 
the experimenter? Would their willingness to comply 
decrease as the intensity of the shock was increased?
To test these hypotheses, Milgram hired a set of sub￾jects. Each was led to believe that the experiment was to 
investigate the effect of punishment on memory. Their 
job was to act as teachers and administer punishment 
whenever the learner made a mistake on the learning test.
Punishment was administered by an electric shock. 
The subject sat in front of a shock generator with 30 
levels of shock—beginning at zero and progressing in 
15-volt increments to a high of 450 volts. The demarca￾tions of these positions ranged from “Slight Shock” at 
15 volts to “Danger: Severe Shock” at 450 volts. To 
increase the realism of the experiment, the subjects 
received a sample shock of 45 volts and saw the learner—
a pleasant, mild-mannered man about 50 years old—
strapped into an “electric chair” in an adjacent room. Of 
course, the learner was an actor, and the electric shocks 
were phony, but the subjects did not know this.
Taking his seat in front of the shock generator, the 
subject was directed to begin at the lowest shock level 
and to increase the shock intensity to the next level each 
time the learner made a mistake or failed to respond.
When the test began, the shock intensity rose rap￾idly because the learner made many errors. The sub￾ject got verbal feedback from the learner: At 75 volts, 
the learner began to grunt and moan; at 150 volts, he 
demanded to be released from the experiment; at 180 
volts, he cried out that he could no longer stand the 
pain; and at 300 volts, he insisted that he be let out, 
yelled about his heart condition, screamed, and then 
failed to respond to further questions.
Most subjects protested and, fearful they might kill 
the learner if the increased shocks were to bring on a 
heart attack, insisted they could not go on with their 
job. Hesitations or protests by the subject were met by 
the experimenter’s statement, “You have no choice; 
you must go on! Your job is to punish the learner’s mis￾takes.” Of course, the subjects did have a choice. All 
they had to do was stand up and walk out.
The majority of the subjects dissented. But dissension 
is not synonymous with disobedience. Sixty-two percent 
of the subjects increased the shock level to the maximum 
of 450 volts. The average level of shock administered by 
the remaining 38 percent was nearly 370 volts.6
In a laboratory experiment such as that conducted 
by Milgram, an artificial environment is created by the 
researcher. Then the researcher manipulates an inde￾pendent variable under controlled conditions. Finally, 
because all other things are held equal, the researcher is 
able to conclude that any change in the dependent vari￾able is due to the manipulation or change imposed on 
the independent variable. Note that, because of the con￾trolled conditions, the researcher is able to imply causa￾tion between the independent and dependent variables.
The laboratory experiment trades off realism and 
generalizability for precision and control. It provides a 
high degree of control over variables and precise mea￾surement of those variables. But findings from labora￾tory studies are often difficult to generalize to the real 
world of work. This is because the artificial laboratory 
rarely duplicates the intricacies and nuances of real 
organizations. In addition, many laboratory experi￾ments deal with phenomena that cannot be repro￾duced or applied to real-life situations.
Field Experiment
The following is an example of a field experiment. The 
management of a large company is interested in de￾termining the impact that a four-day workweek would 
have on employee absenteeism. To be more specific, 
management wants to know if employees working four 
Z01_ROBB0025_19_GE_APP.indd 665 13/12/22 3:28 AM666 APPENDIX Research in Organizational Behavior
ten-hour days have lower absence rates than similar em￾ployees working the traditional five-day week of eight 
hours each day. Because the company is large, it has 
a number of manufacturing plants that employ essen￾tially similar workforces. Two of these are chosen for 
the experiment, both located in the greater Cleveland 
area. Obviously, it would not be appropriate to compare 
two similar-sized plants if one is in rural Mississippi and 
the other is in urban Copenhagen because factors such 
as national culture, transportation, and weather might 
be more likely to explain any differences found than 
changes in the number of days worked per week.
In one plant, the experiment was put into place—
workers began the four-day week. At the other plant, 
which became the control group, no changes were 
made in the employees’ five-day week. Absence data 
were gathered from the company’s records at both loca￾tions for a period of eighteen months. This extended 
time period lessened the possibility that any results 
would be distorted by the mere novelty of changes 
being implemented in the experimental plant. After 
eighteen months, management found that absenteeism 
had dropped by 40 percent at the experimental plant, 
and by only 6 percent in the control plant. Because of 
the design of this study, management believed that the 
larger drop in absences at the experimental plant was 
due to the introduction of the compressed workweek.
The field experiment is similar to the laboratory 
experiment except it is conducted in a real organiza￾tion. The natural setting is more realistic than the 
laboratory setting, and this enhances validity but hin￾ders control. In addition, unless control groups are 
maintained, there can be a loss of control if extrane￾ous forces intervene—for example, an employee strike, 
a major layoff, or a corporate restructuring. Maybe 
the greatest concern with field studies has to do with 
organizational selection bias. Not all organizations are 
going to allow outside researchers to come in and study 
their employees and operations. This is especially true 
of organizations that have serious problems. Therefore, 
because most published studies in OB are done by out￾side researchers, the selection bias might work toward 
the publication of studies conducted almost exclusively 
at successful and well-managed organizations.
Our general conclusion is that, of the four research 
designs we have discussed to this point, the field experi￾ment typically provides the most valid and generaliz￾able findings and, except for its high cost, trades off the 
least to get the most.7
Aggregate Quantitative Reviews
What is the overall effect of organizational behavior 
modification (OB Mod) on task performance? There 
have been a number of field experiments that have 
sought to throw light on this question. Unfortunately, 
the wide range of effects from these various studies 
makes it hard to generalize.
To try to reconcile these diverse findings, two 
researchers reviewed all the empirical studies they could 
find on the impact of OB Mod on task performance 
over a twenty-year period.8
 After discarding reports 
that had inadequate information, had nonquantita￾tive data, or did not meet all conditions associated with 
principles of behavioral modification, the research￾ers narrowed their set to 19 studies that included data 
on 2,818 individuals. Using an aggregating technique 
called meta-analysis, the researchers were able to synthe￾size the studies quantitatively and to conclude that the 
average person’s task performance will rise from the 
50th percentile to the 67th percentile after an OB Mod 
intervention.
The OB Mod–task performance review done by 
these researchers illustrates the use of meta-analysis, 
a quantitative form of literature review that enables 
researchers to look at validity findings from a compre￾hensive set of individual studies and then to apply a 
formula to them to determine if they consistently pro￾duced similar results.9
 If results prove to be consistent, 
it allows researchers to conclude more confidently that 
validity is generalizable. Meta-analysis is a means for 
overcoming the potentially imprecise interpretations 
of qualitative reviews and to synthesize variations in 
quantitative studies. In addition, the technique enables 
researchers to identify potential moderating variables 
between an independent and a dependent variable.
In the past 25 years, there has been a surge in the 
popularity of this research method. Why? It appears 
to offer a more objective means for doing traditional 
literature reviews. Although the use of meta-analysis 
requires researchers to make a number of judgment 
calls, which can introduce a considerable amount of 
subjectivity into the process, there is no denying that 
meta-analysis reviews have now become widespread in 
the OB literature.
Ethics in Research
Researchers are not always tactful or candid with subjects 
when they do their studies. For instance, questions in field 
surveys may be perceived as embarrassing by respondents 
or as an invasion of privacy. Also, researchers in laboratory 
studies have been known to deceive participants about the 
true purpose of their experiment “because they felt decep￾tion was necessary to get honest responses.”10
The “learning experiments” conducted by Stanley 
Milgram, which were conducted more than thirty years 
ago, have been widely criticized by psychologists on eth￾ical grounds. He lied to subjects, telling them his study 
was investigating learning, when, in fact, he was con￾cerned with obedience. The shock machine he used 
was a fake. Even the “learner” was an accomplice of Mil￾gram’s who had been trained to act as if he were hurt 
and in pain. Yet ethical lapses continue. For instance, in 
2001, a professor of organizational behavior at Colum￾bia University sent out a common letter on university 
letterhead to 240 New York City restaurants in which 
he detailed how he had eaten at this restaurant with his 
wife in celebration of their wedding anniversary, how 
he had gotten food poisoning, and that he had spent 
Z01_ROBB0025_19_GE_APP.indd 666 13/12/22 3:28 AMAPPENDIX Research in Organizational Behavior 667
the night in his bathroom throwing up.11 The letter 
closed with: “Although it is not my intention to file any 
reports with the Better Business Bureau or the Depart￾ment of Health, I want you to understand what I went 
through in anticipation that you will respond accord￾ingly. I await your response.” The fictitious letter was 
part of the professor’s study to determine how restau￾rants responded to complaints. But it created culinary 
chaos among many of the restaurant owners, managers, 
and chefs as they reviewed menus and produce deliv￾eries for possibly spoiled food and questioned kitchen 
workers about possible lapses. A follow-up letter of 
apology from the university for “an egregious error in 
judgment by a junior faculty member” did little to off￾set the distress it created for those affected.
Professional associations like the American Psycho￾logical Association, the American Sociological Associa￾tion, and the Academy of Management have published 
formal guidelines for the conduct of research. Yet the 
ethical debate continues. On one side are those who 
argue that strict ethical controls can damage the sci￾entific validity of an experiment and cripple future 
research. Deception, for example, is often necessary to 
avoid contaminating results. Moreover, proponents of 
minimizing ethical controls note that few subjects have 
been appreciably harmed by deceptive experiments. 
Even in Milgram’s highly manipulative experiment, 
only 1.3 percent of the subjects reported negative feel￾ings about their experience. The other side of this 
debate focuses on the rights of participants. Those 
favoring strict ethical controls argue that no procedure 
should ever be emotionally or physically distressing 
to subjects, and that, as professionals, researchers are 
obliged to be completely honest with their subjects and 
to protect the subjects’ privacy at all costs.
Summary
The subject of organizational behavior is composed 
of a large number of theories that are research based. 
Research studies, when cumulatively integrated, be￾come theories, and theories are proposed and followed 
by research studies designed to validate them. The con￾cepts that make up OB, therefore, are only as valid as 
the research that supports them.
The topics and issues in this book are for the most 
part research-derived. They represent the result of 
systematic information gathering rather than merely 
hunch, intuition, or opinion. This does not mean, of 
course, that we have all the answers to OB issues. Many 
require far more corroborating evidence. The gener￾alizability of others is limited by the research methods 
used. But new information is being created and pub￾lished at an accelerated rate. To keep up with the latest 
findings, we strongly encourage you to review regularly 
the latest research in organizational behavior. More 
academic work can be found in journals such as the 
Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management 
Review, Administrative Science Quarterly, Human Rela￾tions, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Manage￾ment, Journal of Organizational Behavior, and Leadership 
Quarterly. For more practical interpretations of OB 
research findings, you may want to read the California 
Management Review, Harvard Business Review, Organiza￾tional Dynamics, and the Sloan Management Review.

The Scenario 
 Morgan-Moe’s drugstores are in trouble. As a major 
regional player in the retail industry, the company has 
hundreds of stores in the upper Midwest. Unfortu￾nately, a sharp decline in the region’s manufacturing 
economy has put management in a serious financial 
bind. Revenues have been consistently dwindling. Cus￾tomers spend less, and the stores have had to switch 
their focus to very low-margin commodities, such as 
milk and generic drugs, rather than the high-margin 
impulse-buy items that used to be the company’s bread 
and butter. The firm has closed several locations, 
reversing its expansion plans for the first time since it 
was incorporated. 
 Because this is uncharted territory for the com￾pany, Jim Claussen, vice president for human relations, 
struggled with how to address the issue with employees. 
As the company’s fortune declined, he could see that 
employees were becoming more and more disaffected. 
Their job insecurity was taking a toll on their job atti￾tudes. The company’s downsizing was big news, and 
the employees did not like what they were hearing. 
 Media reports of Morgan-Moe’s store closings have 
focused on the lack of advance notice or communica￾tion from the company’s corporate offices, as well as 
the lack of severance payments for departing employ￾ees. In the absence of official information, rumors and 
gossip have spread like wildfire among the remaining 
employees. A few angry blogs developed by laid-off 
employees, like IHateMorganMoe.com , have made the 
morale and public relations picture even worse. 
 Morgan-Moe is changing in other ways as well. The 
average age of its workforce is increasing rapidly. A 
couple of factors have contributed to this shift. First, 
fewer qualified young people live in the area because 
many families have moved away to find jobs. Second, 
stores have been actively encouraged to hire older 
workers, such as retirees looking for supplemental 
income. Managers are very receptive to these older 
workers because they are more mature, miss fewer days 
of work, and do not have child care responsibilities. 
They are also often more qualified than younger work￾ers because they have more experience, sometimes in 
the managerial or executive ranks. 
 These older workers have been a great asset to the 
company in troubled times, but they are especially likely 
to leave if things get bad. Suppose these older workers 
start to leave the company, taking their hard-earned 
experience with them. In that case, it seems likely that 
Morgan-Moe will sink deeper toward bankruptcy. 
The System 
 Claussen was not sure how to respond to employees’ 
sense of hopelessness and fear until a friend gave him 
a book titled Man’s Search for Meaning. The book was 
written by a psychologist named Victor Frankl, who 
survived the concentration camps at Auschwitz. Frankl 
found that those who had a clear sense of purpose, a

CASE

reason to live, were more likely to persevere in the face 
of nearly unspeakable suffering. Something about this 
book, and its advocacy of finding meaning and direc￾tion as a way to triumph over adversity, really stuck with 
Claussen. He thought he might be able to apply its les￾sons to his workforce. He proposed a new direction for 
management to the company’s executive committee, 
and they reluctantly agreed to try his suggestions.
Over the past six months, stores throughout the 
company have used a performance management system 
that, as Claussen says, “gets people to buy into the idea 
of performing so that they can see some real results in 
their stores. It is all about seeing that your work serves 
a broader purpose. I read about how some companies 
have been sharing store performance information 
with employees to get them to understand what their 
jobs really mean and participate in making changes. I 
thought that was something we would be able to do.”
The human resources (HR) team came up with five 
options for the management system. Corporate allowed 
individual managers to choose the option they thought 
would work best with their employees so that manag￾ers would not feel too much like a rapid change was 
being forced on them. Program I is opting out of the 
new idea, continuing to stay the course, and provid￾ing employees with little to no information or oppor￾tunities for participation. Program II tracks employee 
absence and sick leave data and shares that informa￾tion with individual employees, giving them feedback 
about things they can control. Management takes no 
further action. Program III tracks sales and inventory 
replacement rates across shifts. As in Program II, infor￾mation is shared with employees, but without providing 
employee feedback about absence and sick leave data. 
Program IV, the most comprehensive, tracks the same 
information as Programs II and III. Managers commu￾nicate it in weekly brainstorming sessions, during which 
employees try to determine what they can do better in 
the future and make suggestions for improving store 
performance. Program V keeps the idea of brainstorm￾ing but does not provide employees with information 
about their behavior or company profits.
Since implementing the system, Claussen has spo￾ken with several managers about what motivated them 
to choose the program they did. Artie Washington, who 
chose Program IV, said, “I want to have my employ￾ees’ input on how to keep the store running smoothly. 
Everybody worries about their job security in this econ￾omy. Letting them know what is going on and giving 
them ways to change things keeps them involved.”
Betty Alvarez could not disagree more. She selected 
Program I. “I would rather have my employees doing 
their jobs than going to meetings to talk about doing 
their jobs. That is what management is for.” Michael 
Ostremski, another proponent of Program I, added, “It 
is okay for the employees to feel a little uncertain—if 
they think we are in the clear, they will slack off. If they 
think we are in trouble, they will give up.”
Cal Martins also questions the need to provide 
information to the whole team, but he chose Program 
II. “A person should know where they stand in the job, 
but they do not have to know about everyone else. It 
creates unnecessary tension.”
This is somewhat similar to Cindy Ang’s reason for 
picking Program V. “When we have our brainstorming 
meetings, I learn what they [the employees] think is 
most pressing, not what some spreadsheet says. It gives 
me a better feel for what is going on in my store. Num￾bers count, of course, but they do not tell you every￾thing. I was also a little worried that employees would 
be upset if they saw that we are not performing well.”
Results to Date
Claussen is convinced that the most elaborate pro￾cedure (Program IV) is the most effective. Still, not 
everyone in the executive committee is won over by his 
advocacy. Although they have supported the test imple￾mentation of the system because it appears to have rela￾tively low costs, others on the committee want to see 
results. CEO Jean Masterson has asked for a complete 
breakdown of the performance of the various stores 
over the past four years. She is especially interested in 
seeing how sales figures and turnover rates have been 
affected by the new program.
The company has been collecting data in spread￾sheets on sales and turnover rates. It prepared the fol￾lowing report, which also estimates the dollar cost of 
staff time taken up in each method. These costs are 
based on the number of hours employees spend work￾ing on the program multiplied by their wage rate. Esti￾mates of turnover, profit, and staff time are collected 
per store. Profit and turnover data include means and 
standard deviations across locations; profit is net of the 
monthly time cost. Turnover information refers to the 
percentage of employees who either quit or are termi￾nated in a month.
To see if any patterns emerged in managers’ selec￾tion of programs, the company calculated relation￾ships between program selection and various attributes 
of the stores. Program I was selected most frequently 
by the oldest stores and those in the most economi￾cally distressed areas. Programs II and III were selected 
most frequently by stores in urban areas and in areas 
where the workforce was younger on average. Programs 
IV and V were selected most frequently in rural areas, 
especially where the workforce is older on average.

Your Assignment
Your task is to prepare a report for the company’s exec￾utive committee on the effectiveness of these programs. 
Make certain it is in the form of a professional business 
document. Your audience will not necessarily know 
about the organizational principles you are describing, 
so make sure you provide detailed explanations that 
someone in a real business can understand.
When you write, make sure you touch on the follow￾ing points:
CC-1. Consider the five management systems as vari￾ables in an experiment. Identify the indepen￾dent and dependent variables and explain how 
they are related to one another.
CC-2. Based on the discussion of independent and 
dependent variables in the text, is there any￾thing else you would like to measure as an out￾come?
CC-3. Look over the data and decide which method 
of management appears most effective in gen￾erating revenues and reducing turnover, and 
why. Which methods appear least effective, 
and why?
CC-4. Are there any concerns you have about these 
data?
CC-5. Does a comparison of the number of stores 
using each method influence your conclusions 
at all?
CC-6. Does the fact that managers are selecting the 
specific program to use (including Program I, 
which continues the status quo) affect the infer￾ences you can draw about program success?
CC-7. What are the advantages of randomly assign￾ing different conditions to the stores instead of 
using this self-selection process?
CC-8. How do the changing nature of the workforce 
and the economy, described in your text and 
in the case, affect your conclusions about man￾aging retail employees? Does the participation 
of a more experienced workforce help or hurt 
these programs? Why might these programs 
work differently in an economy that is not 
doing so poorly?
CC-9. Claussen essentially designed the program on 
his own, with very little research into goal set￾ting and motivation. Based on your text, how 
well has he done? Which parts of the program 
appear to fit well with research evidence on 
goal setting? What parts would you change 
to get more substantial improvements in 
employee motivation?
CC-10. Describe the feelings that employees might have 
when these systems are implemented to help 
or hinder the program’s success. What advice 
would you give managers about implementing 
the programs, so they match the principles of 
organizational justice described in your text?

CASE
2 Repairing Jobs That Fail to Satisfy 
Learning Goals 
 Companies often divide work as a way to improve effi￾ciency, but specialization can lead to negative conse￾quences. DrainFlow is a company that has effectively used 
specialization to reduce costs relative to its competitors’ 
costs for years. Still, rising customer complaints suggest 
the firm’s strong position may be slipping. After reading 
the case, you will suggest some ways it can create more 
interesting work for employees. You will also tackle the 
problem of finding people qualified and ready to per￾form the multiple responsibilities required in these jobs. 
Major Topic Areas 
• Job design 
• Job satisfaction 
• Personality 
• Emotional labor 
The Scenario 
 DrainFlow is a large residential and commercial plumb￾ing maintenance firm that operates around the United 
States. It has been a major player in residential plumb￾ing for decades. Its familiar rhyming motto, “When 
Your Drain Will Not Go, Call DrainFlow,” has been plas￾tered on billboards since the 1960s. 
 Lee Reynaldo has been a regional manager at Drain￾Flow for about two years. She used to work for a newer 
competing chain, Lightning Plumber, which has been 
drawing more and more customers from DrainFlow. 
Although her job at DrainFlow pays more, Reynaldo is 
not happy with the way things are going. She noticed 
that the work environment is not as vital or energetic as 
the environment she saw at Lightning. 
 Reynaldo thinks that employees are not motivated to 
provide the type of customer service Lightning Plumber 
employees offer. She recently sent surveys to customers 
to collect performance information, and the data con￾firmed her fears. Although 60 percent of respondents 
said they were satisfied with their experience and would 
use DrainFlow again, 40 percent felt their experience 
was not good, and 30 percent said they would use a com￾petitor the next time they had a plumbing problem. 
 Reynaldo is wondering whether DrainFlow’s job 
design might be contributing to its problems in retain￾ing customers. DrainFlow has about 2,000 employees in 
four basic job categories: plumbers, plumber’s assistants, 
order processors, and billing representatives. This struc￾ture is designed to keep costs as low as possible. Plumb￾ers make very high wages, whereas plumber’s assistants 
make about one-quarter of what a licensed plumber 
makes. Therefore, using plumber’s assistants is a very 
cost-effective strategy that has enabled DrainFlow to 
undercut the competition easily when it comes to price. 
Order processors make even less than assistants but 
about the same as billing processors. All work is very spe￾cialized, but employees are often dependent on another 
job category to perform at their most efficient level. 
 Like most plumbing companies, DrainFlow gets busi￾ness mostly from the Internet. Customers either call in 
to describe a plumbing problem or submit an online 
request for plumbing services, receiving a return call 
with information within 24 hours. In either case, Drain￾Flow’s order processors listen to the customer’s descrip￾tion of the problem to determine whether a plumber or 
a plumber’s assistant should make the service call. The 
job is then assigned accordingly, and a service provider 
goes to the location. When the job has been completed, 
a billing representative relays the fee to the service rep￾resentative via cell phone, who presents a bill to the 
customer for payment. Billing representatives can take 
customers’ credit card payments by phone or e-mail an 
invoice for online payment. 
The Problem 
 Although specialization does cut costs significantly, Rey￾naldo is worried about customer dissatisfaction. Accord￾ing to her survey, about 25 percent of customer contacts 
ended in no service call because customers were confused 
by the order processors’ diagnostic questions and because 
the order processors did not have sufficient knowledge 
or skill to explain the situation. That means fully one in 
four people who call DrainFlow to hire a plumber are 
worse than dissatisfied: They are not customers at all! The 
remaining 75 percent of calls that did end in a customer 
service encounter resulted in other problems. 
 The most frequent complaints Reynaldo found in 
the customer surveys were about response time and 
cost, especially when the wrong person was sent to a 
job. A plumber’s assistant cannot complete a more 
technically complicated job. The appointment has 
to be rescheduled, and the customer’s time and the 
staff’s time have been wasted. The resulting delay often 
caused customers in these situations to decline further 
contact with DrainFlow—many of them decided to go 
with Lightning Plumber. 
Z02_ROBB0025_19_GE_CASE.indd 671 13/12/22 3:31 AM672 Comprehensive Cases
“When I arrive at a job I can’t take care of,” says 
plumber’s assistant Jim Larson, “the customer gets 
ticked off. They thought they were getting a licensed 
plumber since they were calling for a plumber. Telling 
them they have to have someone else come out does 
not go over well.”
On the other hand, when a plumber responds to 
a job easily handled by a plumber’s assistant, the cus￾tomer is still charged at the plumber’s higher pay rate. 
Licensed plumber Luis Berger also does not like being 
in the position of giving customers bad news. “If I get 
called out to do something like snake a drain, the cus￾tomer is not expecting a hefty bill. I’m caught between 
a rock and a hard place—I don’t set the rates or make 
the appointments, but I’m the one who gets it from the 
customer.” Plumbers also resent being sent to do such 
simple work.
Ben McCarty is one of DrainFlow’s order processors. 
He is also frustrated when the wrong person is sent to 
a job but feels he and the other order processors do 
the best they can. “We have a survey we are supposed 
to follow with the calls to find out what the problem 
is and who needs to take the job,” he explains. “The 
customers don’t know that we have a standard form, so 
they think we can answer all their questions. Most of us 
don’t know any more about plumbing than the caller. If 
they don’t use the terms on the survey, we don’t under￾stand what they’re talking about. A plumber would, but 
we are not plumbers; we just take the calls.”
Customer service issues also involve the billing 
representatives. They are the ones who have to keep 
contacting customers about payment. “It’s not my 
fault the wrong guy was sent,” says Elizabeth Monty. 
“If two people went out, that’s two trips. If a plumber 
did the work, you pay plumber rates. Some of these 
customers don’t get that I didn’t take their first call, 
and so I get yelled at.” The billing representatives also 
complain that they see only the tail end of the process, 
so they don’t know what the original call entailed. 
The job is fairly impersonal and much of the work is 
recording customer complaints. Remember—40 per￾cent of customers are not satisfied. The billing repre￾sentatives take the brunt of their negative reactions on 
the phone.
As you can probably tell, all employees have to 
engage in emotional labor, as described in this text, 
and many lack the skills or personality traits to com￾plete the customer interaction component of their 
jobs. They are not trained to provide customer ser￾vice, and they see their work mostly in technical or 
mechanical terms. Quite a few are actually anxious 
about speaking directly with customers. The office 
staff (order processors and billing representatives) 
realize customer service is part of their job. Still, they 
also find dealing with negative feedback from custom￾ers and coworkers taxing.
A couple of years ago, a management consulting 
company was hired to survey DrainFlow worker atti￾tudes. The results showed they were less satisfied than 
workers in other comparable jobs. The following table 
provides a breakdown of respondent satisfaction levels 
across several categories:

The information about average plumbers and aver￾age office workers is taken from the management con￾sulting company’s records of other companies. They 
are not exactly surprising, given some of the com￾plaints DrainFlow employees have made. Top managers 
at DrainFlow are worried about these results, but they 
have not formulated a solution. The traditional Drain￾Flow culture has been focused on cost containment, 
and employee satisfaction has not been a major issue.
The Proposed Solution
The company is in trouble, and as revenues shrink and 
the cost savings that were supposed to be achieved by 
dividing work fail to materialize, a change seems to be 
in order.
Reynaldo is proposing using cash rewards to 
improve performance among employees. She thinks 
if employees were paid based on work outcomes, they 
would work harder to satisfy customers. Because it is 
not easy to measure how satisfied people are with the 
initial call-in, Reynaldo wants to give the order proces￾sors a small reward for every 20 calls successfully com￾pleted. For the hands-on work, she would like to have 
each billing representative collect information about 
customer satisfaction for each completed call. If no 
complaints are made, and the job is handled promptly, 
a moderate cash reward would be given to the plumber 
or plumber’s assistant. If the customer indicates real 
satisfaction with the service, a larger cash reward would 
be provided.
Reynaldo also wants to find people who are a bet￾ter fit with the company’s new goals. The current hiring 
procedure relies on unstructured interviews with each 
location’s general manager. Little consistency is found 
in how these managers choose employees. Most lack 
training in customer service and organizational behav￾ior. Reynaldo thinks it would be better if hiring meth￾ods were standardized across all branches in her region 
to help managers identify recruits who can actually suc￾ceed in the job.
Your Assignment
Your task is to prepare a report for Reynaldo on the 
potential effectiveness of her cash reward and struc￾tured interview programs. Make certain it is in the form 
of a professional business document that you would 
actually give to an experienced manager at this level of 
a fairly large corporation. Reynaldo is very smart when 
managing finances and running a plumbing business. 
Still, she will not necessarily know about the organiza￾tional behavior principles you are describing. Because 
any new proposals must be passed through top manag￾ers, you should also address their concerns about cost 
containment. You will need to make a strong, evidence￾based financial case that changing the management 
style will benefit the company.
When you write, make sure you touch on the follow￾ing points:
CC-11. Although employees are not especially satisfied 
with their work, do you think this is a reason 
for concern? Does research suggest satisfied 
workers are actually better at their jobs? Are 
any other behavioral outcomes associated with 
job satisfaction?
CC-12. Using job characteristics theory, explain why 
the present system of job design may be con￾tributing to employee dissatisfaction. Describe 
some ways you could help employees feel more 
satisfied with their work by redesigning their 
jobs.
CC-13. Reynaldo has a somewhat vague idea about 
how to implement the cash rewards system. 
Describe some of the specific ways you would 
make the reward system work better, based on 
the case.
CC-14. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of 
using financial incentives in a program of this 
nature. What, if any, potential problems might 
arise if people are given money for achieving 
customer satisfaction goals? What other types 
of incentives might be considered?
CC-15. Create a specific plan to assess whether 
the reward system is working. What are the 
dependent variables that should change if 
the system works? How will you go about 
measuring success?
CC-16. What types of hiring recommendations would 
you make to find people better suited for these 
jobs? Which Big Five personality traits would 
be useful for the customer service responsibili￾ties and emotional labor?

Learning Goals 
 Many of the most important organizational behavior 
challenges require coordinating plans and goals among 
groups. This case describes a multiorganizational effort, 
but the same principles of accommodation and compro￾mise also apply when trying to work with multiple divisions 
within a single organization. You will create a blueprint for 
managing a complex development team’s progress to steer 
team members away from negative conflicts and toward 
productive discussion. You will also be asked to help create 
a new message for executives so they can lead effectively. 
Major Topic Areas 
• Group dynamics 
• Maximizing team performance 
• Organizational culture 
• Integrative bargaining 
The Scenario 
 The Woodson Foundation, a large nonprofit social ser￾vice agency, is teaming up with the public school system in 
Washington, DC, to improve student outcomes. There is 
ample room for improvement. The schools have problems 
with truancy, low student performance, and crime. New 
staff members quickly burn out as their initial enthusiasm 
for helping students is blunted by the harsh realities they 
encounter in the classroom. Turnover among new teach￾ers is very high, and many of the best and brightest are the 
most likely to leave for schools that are not as troubled. 
 The plan is to create an experimental after-school pro￾gram that will combine the Woodson Foundation’s skills of 
raising private money and coordinating community lead￾ers with the educational expertise of school staff. Ideally, 
the system will be financially self-sufficient, which is impor￾tant because less money is available for schools than in 
the past. After several months of negotiation, the leaders 
of the Woodson Foundation and the school system have 
agreed that the best course is to develop a new agency 
that will draw on resources from both organizations. The 
Woodson Foundation will provide logistical support and 
program development and measurement staff; the school 
system will provide classrooms and teaching staff. 
 The first stage in bringing this new plan to fruition is 
the formation of an executive development team. This 
team will span multiple functional areas and establish 
the operating plan for improving school performance. 
Its cross-organizational nature means representatives 
from both the Woodson Foundation and the school 
district must participate. The National Coalition for 
Parental Involvement in Education (NCPIE) will also 
be a major partner in the program, acting as a repre￾sentative for parents on behalf of the PTA. 
Conflict and Agreement 
in the Development Team 
 While it would be perfect if all the groups could work 
together easily to improve student outcomes, there is 
little doubt some substantive conflicts will arise. Each 
group has its own interests, and, in some cases, these 
are directly opposed to one another. 
 School district representatives want to ensure that 
the new jobs will be unionized and operate consistently 
with current school board policies. They are very con￾cerned that if Woodson assumes too dominant a role, 
the school board will not control the operations of the 
new system. The complexity of the school system has 
led to the development of a highly complex bureau￾cratic structure over time. Administrators want to make 
sure their policies and procedures will still hold for 
teachers in these programs, even outside the regular 
school day. They also worry that jobs going into the new 
system will take funding from other school district jobs. 
 Woodson, founded by entrepreneur Theodore Wood￾son around 1910, still bears the hallmarks of its founder’s 
way of doing business. Woodson emphasized efficiency 
and experimentation in everything he did. Many of the 
foundation’s charities have won awards for minimizing 
costs while still providing excellent services. Their focus 
on using hard data to measure performance for all their 
initiatives is inconsistent with the school district culture. 
 Finally, the NCPIE is driven by a mission to increase 
parental control. The organization believes that when 
communities can drive their own educational meth￾ods, students and parents can achieve success together. 
The organization is strongly committed to celebrat￾ing the diversity and inclusion of those from various 
backgrounds. Its members are most interested in how 
changes are made, ensuring that everyone can weigh in. 
 Some demographic diversity issues complicate the 
team’s situation. Most of the students served by the 
Washington, DC, school district are Black, along with 
large populations of Hispanics. The NCPIE makeup gen￾erally matches the demographic diversity of the areas 
served by the public schools. The Woodson Foundation, 
Z02_ROBB0025_19_GE_CASE.indd 674 13/12/22 3:31 AMComprehensive Cases 675
based in northern Virginia, is predominantly staffed by 
White professionals. There is some concern that this 
new group that will be so involved in this major change 
in educational administration does not understand the 
demographic concerns of the community. The leader￾ship of the new program will have to be able to present 
a compelling message for generating enthusiasm for the 
program across diverse stakeholder groups.
Although the groups differ in important ways, it is also 
worth considering what they have in common. All are 
interested in meeting the needs of students. All would 
like to increase student learning. The school system does 
benefit from anything that increases student test scores. 
The Woodson Foundation and NCPIE are united in their 
desire to see more parents engaged in the system.
Candidates for the 
Development Team
The development team will consist of three 
individuals—an HR representative from the Woodson 
Foundation, one from the school system, and one from 
the NCPIE. They have prepared the following list of 
potential candidates for consideration.
Victoria Adams is the superintendent of schools for 
Washington, DC. She spearheaded the initial commu￾nication with the Woodson Foundation and has been 
building support among teachers and principals. She 
thinks the schools and the foundation need to have 
larger roles than the parents and communities. “Of 
course, we want their involvement and support, but as 
professionals, we should have more say when it comes 
to making decisions and implementing programs. We 
do not want to shut anyone out, but we have to be real￾istic about what the parents can do.”
Duane Hardy has been a principal in the Washing￾ton area for more than 15 years. He also thinks the 
schools should have the most power. “We are the ones 
who work with these kids every day. I have watched 
class sizes get bigger, and scores and graduation rates 
go down. Yes, we need to fix this, but these outside 
groups cannot understand the limitations we are deal￾ing with. We have the community, the politicians, the 
taxpayers—everyone watching what we are doing, 
everyone thinking they know what is best. The parents, 
at least, have more of a stake in this.”
“The most important thing is the kids,” says 
second-year teacher Ari Kaufman, who is well liked by 
his students but does not get along well with other fac￾ulty members. He is seen as a “squeaky wheel.” “The 
schools need change so badly. And how did they get 
this way? From too little outside involvement.”
Community organizer Mason Dupree does not like the 
level of bureaucracy either. He worries that the school’s 
answer to its problems is to throw more money at them. 
“I know these kids. I grew up in these neighborhoods. 
My parents knew every single teacher I had. The schools 
wanted our involvement then. Now all they want is our 
money. And I would not mind giving it to them if I thought 
it would be used responsibly, not spent on raises for people 
who have not shown they can get the job done.”
Meredith Watson, with the Woodson Foundation, 
agrees the schools have become less focused on the 
families. A former teacher, she left the field of educa￾tion after being in the classroom for 6 years. “There is 
so much waste in the system,” she complains. “Jobs are 
unnecessarily duplicated, change processes are need￾lessly convoluted. Unless you are an insider already, 
you can’t get anything done. These parents want to be 
involved. They know their kids best.”
Unlike her NCPIE colleagues, Candace Sharpe thinks 
the schools are doing the best they can. She is a county 
social worker, relatively new to the DC area. “Parents say 
they want to be involved but then don’t follow through. We
need to step it up. We need to lead the way. Lasting change 
doesn’t come from the outside; it comes from the home.”
Victor Martinez has been at the Woodson Founda￾tion for 10 years, starting as an intern straight out of col￾lege. “It’s sometimes hard to see a situation when you’re 
in the thick of it,” he explains. “Nobody likes to be told 
they’re doing something wrong, but sometimes it has to 
be said. We all know there are flaws in the system. We 
can’t keep the status quo. It just isn’t cutting it.”
Strategies for the Program Team
Once the basic membership and principles for the devel￾opment team have been established, the program team 
would also like to develop a handbook for those who will 
be running the new program. Ideally, this set of princi￾ples can help train new leaders to create an inspirational 
message that will facilitate success. The actual content of 
the program and the nature of the message will be ham￾mered out by the development team. However, it is still 
possible to generate some overriding principles for the 
program team in advance of these decisions.
Your Assignment
The Woodson Foundation, the NCPIE, and the 
schools have asked you to provide some information 
about forming teams effectively. They would like your 
response to explain what should be done at each step 
of the way, from selecting appropriate team members 
to setting group priorities and goals, setting deadlines, 
and describing effective methods for resolving conflicts 
that arise. After this, they would like you to prepare a 
short set of principles for the newly established pro￾gram leaders. That means you will have two audiences: 
the development team, which will receive one report 
on how it can effectively design the program, and the 
program team, which will receive one report on how it 
can effectively lead the new program.

Boundaryless Organizations 
 The following points should help you form a com￾prehensive message for the development team: 
 CC- 17. The development team will be more effective 
if members have some idea about how groups 
and teams typically operate. Review the domi￾nant perspectives on team formation and per￾formance from the chapters in the text for the 
committee to know what to expect. 
 CC- 18. Given the profiles of candidates for the devel￾opment team, provide suggestions for who 
would likely be a good group member and 
who might be less effective in this situation. 
Be sure you are using the research on groups 
and teams in the text to defend your choices. 
 CC- 19. Using principles from the chapters on groups 
and teams, describe how you will advise the 
team to manage conflict effectively. 
 CC- 20. Describe how integrative negotiation strategies 
might achieve joint goals for the development 
team. 
 The following points should help you form a mes￾sage for the program team: 
 CC- 21. Leaders of the new combined organization should 
have a good idea of the culture of the school dis￾trict, the NCPIE, and the Woodson Foundation 
because they will need to manage relationships 
with all three groups on an ongoing basis. How 
would you describe the culture of these various 
stakeholder organizations? Use concepts from 
the chapter on organizational culture to describe 
how they differ and how they are similar. 
 CC- 22. Consider how leaders of the new program 
can generate a transformational message 
and encourage employee and parent trust. 
Using material from the chapter on leader￾ship, describe how you would advise leaders to 
accomplish these ends. 
 CC- 23. Given the potential for demographic fault￾lines in negotiating these changes, what would 
you advise as a strategy for managing diversity 
issues for program leaders?

Learning Goals 
 The multinational organization is an increasingly com￾mon and important part of the economy. This case 
takes you into the world of a cutting-edge music soft￾ware business seeking success across three very differ￾ent national and organizational cultures. Its managers 
need to make important decisions about how to struc￾ture work processes so employees can be satisfied and 
productive doing very different tasks. 
Major Topic Areas 
• Organizational structure and boundaryless 
organizations 
• Organizational culture 
• Human resources 
• Organizational socialization 
The Scenario 
 Newskool Grooves is a transnational company developing 
music software. The software is used to compose music, 
play music in clubs, and produce albums. Founder and 
CEO Gerd Finger is, understandably, the company’s big￾gest fan. “I started this company from nothing, from just 
me, my ideas, and my computer. I love music—love play￾ing music, love writing programs for making music, love 
listening to music—and the money is nice, too.” Finger 
says he never wanted to work for someone else, to give 
away his ideas and let someone else profit from them. 
He wanted to keep control over them and their image. 
“Newskool Grooves is always ahead of the pack. In this 
business, if you cannot keep up, you are out. And we are 
the company everyone else must keep up with. Everyone 
knows when they get something from us, they are getting 
only the best and the newest.” 
 The company headquarters are in Berlin. The head￾quarters are the nerve center for the organization, 
where new products are developed and the organiza￾tional strategy is established. Newskool outsources a 
great deal of its coding work to programmers in Kiev, 
Ukraine. Its marketing efforts are increasingly based 
in its Los Angeles offices. This division of labor is at 
least partially based on technical expertise and cost 
issues. The German team excels at design and produc￾tion tasks. Because most of Newskool’s customers are 
English speakers, the Los Angeles office has been the 
best group to write ads and market products. The Kiev 
offices are filled with outstanding programmers who 
do not require the very high compensation rates you 
would find in German or US offices. The combination 
Z02_ROBB0025_19_GE_CASE.indd 676 13/12/22 3:31 AMComprehensive Cases 677
of high-tech software, rapid reorganization, and out￾sourcing make Newskool the very definition of a 
boundaryless organization.
Finger also makes the final decision on hiring every 
employee for the company and places a heavy emphasis 
on independent work styles. “Why would I want to put 
my company in the hands of people I can’t count on?” 
he asks with a laugh. “They have to believe in what we 
are doing here, really understand our direction, and be 
able to go with it. I’m not the babysitter; I’m not the 
schoolmaster handing out homework. School time is 
over. This is the real world.”
The Work Culture
Employees want to work at this company because it is 
cutting edge. Newskool’s software is used by several elec￾tronic dance music (EDM) DJs, the firm’s core market, 
seeing it as a relatively expensive but very high-quality 
and innovative brand. Whenever the rest of the mar￾ket for music software goes in one direction, it seems 
like Newskool heads in a completely different direction 
to keep itself separate from the pack. This strategy has 
tended to pay off. While competitors develop similar 
products and therefore need to lower their prices con￾tinually to compete with one another, Newskool has 
kept revenues high by creating completely new types of 
products that do not face this type of price competition.
Unfortunately, piracy has eroded Newskool’s abil￾ity to make money with just software-based music tools. 
It has had to move into hardware production, such 
as drum machines and amplifiers that incorporate its 
computer technology. Making this massive market 
change might be challenging for some companies. Still, 
for an organization that reinvents itself every two or 
three years as Newskool does, the bigger fight is a con￾stant war against stagnation and rigidity.
The organization has a very decentralized culture. 
With only 115 employees, the original management phi￾losophy of allowing all employees to participate in deci￾sion making and innovation is still the lifeblood of the 
company’s culture. One developer notes, “At Newskool, 
they want you to be part of the process. If you are a per￾son who wants to do what you’re told at work, you’re in 
trouble. Most times, they can’t tell you what they want 
you to do next—they don’t even know what comes next! 
That’s why they hire creative employees, people who can 
try to make the next thing happen. It’s challenging, but 
a lot of us think it’s very much an exciting environment.”
The Boundaryless Environment
Because so much of the work can be performed on com￾puters, Finger decided early to allow employees to work 
outside the office. The senior management in Berlin and 
Los Angeles are both quite happy with this arrangement. 
Because some marketing work does require face-to-face 
contact, the Los Angeles office has weekly in-person 
meetings. Employees who like Newskool are happiest 
when they can work through the night and sleep most 
of the day, firing up their computers to get work done at 
the drop of a hat. Project discussions often happen via 
social networking on the company’s intranet.
The Kiev offices have been less eager to work with 
the boundaryless model. Managers say their computer 
programmers find working with so little structure 
rather uncomfortable. They are more used to the idea 
of a strong leadership structure and well-defined work 
processes.
“When I started,” says one manager, “Gerd said get￾ting in touch with him would be no problem; getting in 
touch with LA would be no problem. We’re small, we’re 
family, he said. Well, it is a problem. When I call LA, 
they say to wait until their meeting day. I can’t always 
wait until they decide to get together. I call Gerd—he 
says, ‘Figure it out.’ Then when I do, he says it isn’t 
right, and we have to start again. If he just told me in 
the first place, we would have done it.”
Some recent events have also shaken up the compa￾ny’s usual way of doing business. Developers in the cor￾porate offices had a major communications breakdown 
about their hardware DJ controller, which required 
many hours of discussion to resolve. It seems that people 
who seldom met face-to-face had all made progress—but 
had moved in opposite directions. To test and design the 
company’s hardware products, employees apparently 
need to do more than send each other code; sometimes, 
they need to collaborate face to face. Some spirited dis￾agreements have been voiced within the organization 
about how to move forward in this new environment.
The offices are experiencing additional difficulties. 
Since the shift to newer products, Sandra Pelham has 
been more critical of the company in the Los Angeles 
office. “With the software, we were more limited in the 
kinds of advertising media we could access. So now, with 
the hardware—real instruments—we finally thought, 
‘All right, this is something we can work with!’ We had 
a whole slate of musicians and DJs and producers to 
contact for endorsements, but Gerd said, ‘No way.’ He 
did not want customers who only cared that a celebrity 
liked us. He scrapped the whole campaign. He says we 
are all about creativity and doing our own thing—until 
we do not want to do things his way.”
Although the organization is not without problems, 
there is little question Newskool has been a standout 
success in the computer music software industry. While 
many are shuttering their operations, Newskool uses its 
market power to push forward the next generation of 
electronic music-making tools. As Gerd Finger puts it, 
“Once the rest of the industry has gotten together and 
figured out how they are all going to cope with change, 
they will look around and see that we’re already three 
miles ahead of them down the road to the future.”

The Stress of Caring 
Your Assignment 
 Finger has asked for your advice on how to keep his 
organization successful. He wants to benchmark how 
other boundaryless organizations in the tech sector stay 
competitive despite the challenge of so many workers 
heading in so many different directions. You will need 
to prepare a report for the company’s executive com￾mittee. Your report should read like a proposal to a 
corporate executive who has a great deal of knowledge 
about the technical aspects of their company but might 
not have much knowledge of organizational behavior. 
 When you write, make sure you touch on the follow￾ing points: 
 CC- 24. Identify some of the problems likely to occur 
in a boundaryless organization like Newskool 
Grooves. What are the advantages of bound￾aryless organizations? 
 CC- 25. Consider some of the cultural issues that will 
affect a company operating in such different 
parts of the world and whose employees may 
not represent the national cultures of each 
country. Are the conflicts you observe a func￾tion of the different types of work people have 
to perform? 
 CC- 26. Based on what you know about motivation and 
personality, what types of people are likely to 
be satisfied in each area of the company? Use 
concepts from job characteristics theory and 
the emerging social relationships perspec￾tive to describe what might need to change to 
increase employee satisfaction in all areas. 
 CC- 27. What types of human resources practices need 
to be implemented in this sort of organiza￾tion? What principles of selection and hiring 
are likely to be effective? Which Big Five traits 
and abilities might Newskool supervisors want 
to use for selection? 
 CC- 28. What kind of performance measures might 
you want to see for each office? 
 CC- 29. How can the company establish a socialization 
program that will maximize employee creativ￾ity and independence? Do employees in all its 
locations need equal levels of creativity?

Learning Goals 
 One of the most consistent changes in work structure 
over the past few decades has been a shift from a manu￾facturing economy to a service economy. More workers 
are now engaged in jobs that include providing care 
and assistance, especially in education and medicine. 
This work is satisfying for some people, but it can also 
be highly stressful. In the following scenario, consider 
how a company in the nursing care industry responds 
to the challenges of the new environment. 
Major Topic Areas 
• Stress 
• Organizational change 
• Emotions 
• Leadership 
The Scenario 
 Parkway Nursing Care is an organization facing a mas￾sive change. The company was founded in 1982 with 
just two nursing homes in Phoenix, Arizona. The com￾pany was very successful, and throughout the 1990s, 
it continued to turn a consistent profit while slowly 
acquiring or building 30 more units. This low-profile 
approach changed forever in 2003 when venture capi￾talist Robert Quine decided to make a major invest￾ment in expanding Parkway in return for a portion of 
its profits over the coming years. The number of nurs￾ing homes exploded, and Parkway was operating 180 
homes by the year 2010. 
 The company now has 220 facilities in the south￾western United States, with an average of 115 beds 
per facility and a total of nearly 30,000 employees. 
In addition to health care facilities, it also provides 
skilled in-home nursing care. Parkway is seen as one 
of the best care facilities in the region, and it has won 
numerous awards for its achievements in the field. 
 As members of the baby boom generation become 
senior citizens, the need for skilled care will only 
increase. Parkway wants to make sure it is in a good 
position to meet this growing need. This means the 
company must continue expanding rapidly. 
 The pressure for growth is one significant chal￾lenge, but it is not the only one. The nursing home 
industry has come under increased government scru￾tiny following investigations that turned up widespread 
patient abuse and billing fraud. Parkway has always 
had outstanding patient care. No substantiated claim 
of abuse or neglect in any of its homes has ever been 
Z02_ROBB0025_19_GE_CASE.indd 678 13/12/22 3:31 AMComprehensive Cases 679
made. However, the need for increased documentation 
will still affect the company. As the federal government 
tries to trim Medicare expenses, Parkway may face a 
reduction in funding.
The Problem
As growth continues, Parkway has remained commit￾ted to maintaining the dignity and health of all resi￾dents in its facilities. The board of directors wants to 
see a renewed commitment to the firm’s mission and 
core values, not a diffusion of its culture. Its mem￾bers are worried there might be problems to address. 
Interviews with employees suggest there is plenty to 
worry about.
Shift leader Maxine Vernon has been with Park￾way for 15 years. “Now that the government keeps a 
closer eye on our staffing levels, I’ve seen manage￾ment do what it can to keep positions filled, and I 
don’t always agree with who is hired. Some of the 
basic job skills can be taught, sure, but how to care
for our patients—a lot of these new kids just don’t 
pick up on that.”
“The problem isn’t with staff—it’s with Parkway’s 
focus on filling the beds,” says nurse’s aide Bobby 
Reed. “When I started here, Parkway’s reputation was 
still about the service. Now it’s about numbers. No one 
is intentionally negligent—there just are too many 
patients to see.”
A recent college graduate with a BA in psychology, 
Dalton Manetti is more stressed than he expected. 
“These aren’t the sweet grannies you see in the mov￾ies. Our patients are demanding. They complain 
about everything, even about being called patients, 
probably because most of them think they shouldn’t 
be here in the first place. A lot of times, their gripes 
amount to nothing, but we have to log them in any￾way.”
Carmen Frank has been with Parkway for almost a 
year and is already considering finding a new job. “I 
knew there were going to be physical parts to this job, 
and I thought I’d be able to handle that. It’s not like I 
was looking for a desk job, you know? After every shift, 
I go home with aches all over—my back, arms, and 
legs. I’ve never had to take so much time off from a job 
because I hurt. And then when I come back, I feel like 
the rest of the staff thinks I’m weak.”

“I started working here right out of high school 
because it was the best-paid of the jobs I could get,” says 
Niecey Wilson. “I had no idea what I was getting myself 
into. Now I really like my job. Next year I’m going 
to start taking some night classes so I can move into 
another position. But some of the staff just think of this 
as any other job. They don’t see the patients as people, 
more like inventory. If they want to work with inventory, 
they should get a job in retail.”
Last month, the company’s human resources depart￾ment pulled the above information from its records at 
the board of directors’ request. The numbers provide 
some quantitative support for the concerns voiced by 
staff.
Injuries to staff occur mostly because of back strain 
from lifting patients. Patient incidents reflect injuries 
due to slips, falls, medication errors, or other accidents. 
Certified absences are days off from work due to medi￾cally verified illnesses or injuries. Other absences are 
days missed that are not due to injuries or illnesses; 
these are excused absences (unexcused absences are 
grounds for immediate firing).

Using Organizational 
Development to Combat Stress 
and Improve Performance
The company wants to use organizational development 
methods such as appreciative inquiry (AI) to create 
change and re-energize its sense of mission. As the chap￾ter on organizational change explains, AI procedures 
systematically collect employee input and then use this 
information to create a change message everyone can 
support. The human resources department conducted 
focus groups, asking employees to describe their con￾cerns and suggestions for the future. The focus groups 
highlighted many suggestions, although they do not all 
suggest movement in the same direction.
Many suggestions concerned schedule flexibility. 
One representative comment was this: “Most of the 
stress on this job comes because we can’t take time off 
when we need it. The LPNs [licensed practical nurses, 
who do much of the care] and orderlies can’t take time 
off when they need to. Still, many of them are single 
parents or primary caregivers for their own children. 
When they have to leave for child care responsibilities, 
the work suffers, and there’s no contingency plan to 
help smooth things over. Then everyone who is left has 
to work extra hard. The person who takes time off feels 
guilty, and there can be fights over taking time off. If we 
had some way of covering these emergency absences, 
we’d all be a lot happier, and I think the care would be 
a lot better.”
Other suggestions proposed better methods for 
communicating information across shifts. Most of 
the documentation for shift work is done in large 
spiral notebooks. When a new shift begins, staff 
members say they don’t have much time to check on 
what happened in the previous shift. Some younger 
caregivers would like to have a method that lets 
them document patient outcomes electronically 
because they type faster than they can write. The 
older caregivers are more committed to the paper￾based process, in part because they think switching 
systems would require a lot of work. (Government 
regulations on health care reporting require that 
any documentation be made in a form that can￾not be altered after the fact to prevent covering up 
abuse, so specialized software systems must be used 
for electronic documentation.)
Finally, the nursing care staff believes its perspec￾tives on patient care are seldom given an appropriate 
hearing. “We’re the ones who are with the patients 
most of the time, but when it comes to doing this the 
right way, our point of view gets lost. We really could 
save a lot of money by eliminating some of these unnec￾essary routines and programs. Still, it’s something man￾agement always just says it will consider.”
Staff members seem to want some way to provide 
suggestions for improvement, but it is unclear what 
method they would prefer.
Your Assignment
Parkway has taken some initial steps in this new direc￾tion, but clearly, it has a lot of work left to do. As 
a change management consultant, you have been 
brought in to help the company change its culture 
and respond to the stress that employees experience. 
Remember to create your report as if it is for the lead￾ership of a major corporation.
When you write your recommendations, make sure 
you touch on the following points:
CC-30. What do the data on employee injuries, inci￾dents, absences, and turnover suggest to you? 
Is there a reason for concern about the com￾pany’s direction?
CC-31. The company will be making some significant 
changes based on the AI process, and most 
change efforts are associated with resistance. 
What are the most common forms of resis￾tance, and which would you expect to see at 
Parkway?
CC-32. Given the board of directors’ desire to 
re-energize the workforce, what advice would 
you provide for creating a leadership strategy? 
What leader behaviors should nursing home 
directors and nurse supervisors demonstrate?
CC-33. What are the major sources of job stress at 
Parkway? What does the research on employee 
stress suggest you should do to help minimize 
the experience of psychological strain for 
employees? Create a plan for how to reduce 
stress among employees.
CC-34. Based on the information collected in the 
focus groups, design a survey to hand out to 
employees. What sort of data should the survey 
gather? What types of data analysis methods 
would you like to employ for these data?
