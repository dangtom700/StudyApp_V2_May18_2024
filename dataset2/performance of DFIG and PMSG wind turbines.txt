Due to environmental pollution and climate change, the use of renewable energy 
sources as an alternative means of power generation is on the rise globally. This is 
because of their clean nature, which makes them eco-friendly with little or no pollu￾tion compared to traditional fossil fuel power-generated power plants.
Among the various renewable energy sources, wind energy is one of the most 
widely employed, due to its promising technology. Wind turbine technologies could 
be classified into two groups as follows: Fixed Speed Wind Turbines (FSWTs) and 
Variable Speed Wind Turbines (VSWTs). There have been tremendous improvement 
in wind turbine technology over the years, from FSWTs to VSWTs, as a result of fast 
innovations and advanced developments in power electronics. Thus, VSWTs have 
better wind energy capture and conversion efficiencies, less acoustic noise and 
mechanical stress, and better power quality in power grids without support from 
external reactive power compensators due to the stochastic nature of wind energy.
The two most widely employed VSWTs in wind farm development are the Doubly 
Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) and the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator 
(PMSG) wind turbines. In order to solve transient stability intricacies during power 
grid faults, this book proposes different control strategies for the DFIG and PMSG 
wind turbines.

Preface
With the recent proliferation and penetration of wind farms into existing power 
grids, it is paramount to conduct numerous studies to counter grid disturbances 
based on operational grid codes. Electric power from wind energy could be extracted 
by employing the promising technologies of the Doubly Fed Induction Generator 
(DFIG) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (PMSG) wind turbines. In 
order to solve transient stability intricacies posed by the stochastic nature of wind 
energy during grid faults, this book would propose different control strategies for 
DFIG and PMSG wind turbines. The control strategies would be based on Fault 
Current Limiters (FCLs). The Series Dynamic Braking Resistor (SDBR) would be 
the first FCL to be investigated in this book. The best location to place the SDBR on 
the machine side and grid side converters of both DFIG and PMSG wind turbines 
would be investigated, considering different switching strategies. Efforts would also 
be made to determine the suitable sizing of the SDBR. The performance of the SDBR 
would be investigated at various network strengths in weak and strong grids for both 
wind turbines. Both severe three-line-to-ground faults and asymmetrical faults of 
line-to-line, double-line-to-ground and one-line-to-ground would be used to test the 
robustness and rigidity of the controllers of the wind generators.
In weak grids, the challenges of network stability are a result of wind energy pen￾etration. The Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) based on Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) 
is employed widely in interfacing sources with regard to renewable energy and the 
grid. The utilization of these inverters would cause stability issues in the power grid. 
The studies carried out in the literature show that VSI control could affect the stabil￾ity of power grids. In addition, the stability of grid-connected VSI can be affected by 
a weak grid. A grid that has a low Short Circuit Ratio (SCR) is said to be weak. In 
other words, a grid is said to be weak if it has an impedance that is high and low 
inertia constant. In this book, the performance of both wind turbines would be tested 
in weak, normal and strong grids, in addition to the SDBR implementation on both 
wind turbines. The recently stipulated grid codes require that wind generators re￾initiate normal power production after grid voltage sag. This book will also present a 
comparative performance of two commonly employed variable speed wind turbines 
in today’s electricity market: the DFIG and the PMSG wind turbines. The evaluation 
of both wind turbines was done for weak, normal and strong grids, considering the 
same machine ratings of the wind turbines. Because of the critical situations of the 
wind turbines during faulty conditions in the weak grids, an analysis was done con￾sidering the use of effective SDBR for both wind turbines. The grid voltage variable 
was employed as the signal for switching the SDBR in both wind turbines during 
transient state. Also, an overvoltage protection system was considered for both wind 
turbines using the DC chopper in the DC-link excitation circuitry of both wind tur￾bines. Furthermore, a combination of the SDBR and DC chopper was employed in 
both wind turbines at weak grid condition in order to improve the performance of the 
variable speed wind turbines.xii Preface
The performance of other FCLs would be investigated in the DFIG and PMSG 
wind turbines in this book. The FCLs are the Bridge FCL and the Capacitive FCL. 
Controlling variable speed wind turbines during transient state is challenging. The 
use of variable speed wind turbines based on PMSG is on the rise due to some of the 
features of the wind turbine. According to the grid code requirements, grid-connected 
wind turbine systems should achieve active power control and provide Low Voltage 
Ride Through (LVRT) capability. Thus, the primary target of the wind turbine control 
system is to keep the turbine connected to the grid during grid disturbances or fail￾ures. In this book, the SDBR and the Bridge Fault Current Limiter (BFCL) were used 
to improve the LVRT of PMSG wind turbines. The topology of the PMSG grid side 
voltage source converter, with the SDBR and BFCL, was modeled during steady and 
transient states. The performance of both schemes on the PMSG was analyzed and 
compared during a severe balanced fault scenario. In addition, a scenario with any of 
the schemes was also considered. For fair comparison, the PMSG wind turbine was 
operating at its rated speed during the low voltage and the same conditions of opera￾tion were used for all the considered scenarios.
This book proposes a supercapacitor strategy for improving the capability of grid￾connected Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) wind turbines during fault sce￾narios. Supercapacitors are one of the important components in sustainable energy 
systems that are commonly used to store energy. In DFIGs, the super-capacitor is 
used to compensate for voltage dips and damping oscillations. In this book, a new 
topology of supercapacitor system was investigated in a DFIG wind turbine during 
transient state. The model system employed was a DFIG connected to the earlier 
wind turbine technology of a fixed speed squirrel cage induction generator. Efforts 
were made to determine the effective parameters and switching strategies of the 
supercapacitor by considering different scenarios, in order to improve the transient 
state of the wind generator. The results obtained under severe grid fault were com￾pared considering the different parameters of the resistance, inductance and capaci￾tance of the supercapacitor. The DC-link voltage and grid voltage switching strategies 
of the supercapacitor were investigated. Furthermore, the results of the proposed 
DFIG supercapacitor were compared with the traditional parallel capacitor scheme 
for DFIG system. For fair comparison between the DFIG supercapacitor and parallel 
capacitor-based solution, the capacitance value considered was the same to buffer the 
transient energy.
This book also investigates the transient performance of the two DFIG and the 
PMSG wind turbines. The machine parameters of both wind turbines were varied 
considering different scenarios, while keeping other parameters constant, in order to 
study the behavior of the wind generators. The study was carried out using the same 
operating conditions of rated wind speed, based on the wind turbine characteristics 
of both wind turbine technologies. The wind turbines were subjected to a severe 
three-phase-to-ground bolted fault, in order to test the robustness of their controllers 
during grid fault conditions. Efforts were made to carry out an extensive comparative 
study to investigate the machine parameters that have more influence on the stability 
of the different wind turbines considered in this study. Effective machine parameter 
selection could help solve Fault Ride Through (FRT) problems in a cost-effective Preface xiii
way for both VSWTs, without considering external circuitry and changing of the 
original architecture of the wind turbines.
The system performance carried out in this book was evaluated using Power 
System Computer Design and Electromagnetic Transient Including DC (PSCAD/
EMTDC) platform. The same conditions of operation were used in investigating the 
various scenarios considered in this study, for effective comparison.

1.1 OVERVIEW OF GLOBAL WIND ENERGY INSTALLATIONS
The global cumulative wind power capacity is around 743 Gigawatts (GW), as a 
result of the recent installation of 93 GW, in 2020 [1]. There was a 59% increment 
in the wind onshore market in 2020, accounting for 86.9 GW more installations, 
compared to 2019. The two countries taking the lead for onshore wind markets glob￾ally are China and the USA, with new onshore additions and increased market share 
ranging from 15 to 76%. Also, in the year 2020, on the regional level, onshore wind 
installations in Asia Pacific, North America and Latin America were on the rise. The 
total new wind installations in these three regions was 74 GW of new onshore wind 
capacity or 76% more than in 2019. As a result of the slow recovery of onshore 
installations in Germany in recent times, Europe experienced only 0.6% new onshore 
installations, while in Africa and the Middle East only 8.2 GW wind onshore installa￾tions were observed, with little or no considerable increment with the previous year.
Globally, in the offshore market, 6.1 GW was added in 2020, which is one of the 
highest wind offshore installations, with China taking the lead in installing half of the 
new offshore wind capacity. Europe experienced steady growth, with the Netherlands, 
Belgium, the UK, Germany and Portugal, taking leads, accordingly. Besides, in 
2020, the United States and South Korea shared the remaining new offshore wind 
installations, making the cumulative offshore wind power capacity more than 35 GW 
or 4.8% of global cumulative wind power capacity [1]. Though, the global wind 
market growth would likely slow down in the near future because of an anticipated 
drop in onshore wind installations in China and in the United States as a result of 
incentive schemes that would expire [2, 3]. However, the wind market outlook still 
remains promising, with an expectation of over 469 GW of new wind onshore and 
offshore wind capacity in the next five years (accounting for about 94 GW of yearly 
new installations until 2025), considering present and new policies [1, 4].
Also, there was a milestone commitment to carbon neutrality in 2020, with the 
European Union, Japan, South Korea, Canada and South Africa each pledging to 
achieve net zero by the year 2050. In addition to China’s net zero by 2060 target and 
the United States by 2050, the current net zero targets is 2/3 of the global economy, 
representing 63% of global emissions [5, 6]. Based on these facts, it is obvious that 
the era of fossil fuels is over and quickly taken over by the global energy transition.

12 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
There is no doubt that the wind industry has demonstrated incredible resilience, 
recently. The proliferation of wind farms and renewable energy is required to help 
limit global warming to below 2 °C, based on the Paris Agreement. Figure 1.1 shows 
the total new wind installations required by International Energy Agency (IEA), to 
achieve net zero by 2050 [7]. Figure 1.1 reflects that the annual wind installations 
must increase steadily in order to achieve net zero by 2050, by the addition of new 
global wind installations in (GW), ranging from 60 GW in 2019 to 280 GW in 2030, 
with an increased Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) value of 17% at the end 
of 2025 and 12% at the end of 2030 [1, 7].
Figure 1.2 shows that in the year 2020, the new installations in the onshore wind 
market got up to 86.9 GW, while the offshore wind market was 6.1 GW, reflecting a 
considerable high onshore and offshore wind power installations around the globe. 
This was driven basically by China, Asia Pacific, where wind power continues to take 
the lead in global wind power developments, increasing its global market region by 
8.5% in 2020 [1]. Another driving force for global wind power installation is the 
United States, and North America with a global market share of 18.4%, replacing 
Europe with 15.9%, as the second-largest regional market for new wind power instal￾lations. Latin America holds the fourth-largest regional market wind power installa￾tions with 5.0% in 2020, followed by Africa and the Middle East with regional wind 
power installations of 0.9%, in the same year. Figure 1.3 shows the new wind power 
capacity by region in 2020, while Figure 1.4 shows the global top five markets in the 
year 2020 for new wind power installations, where China, the United States, Brazil, 
Netherlands and Germany are taking the lead with a total of 80.6% of global wind 
power installations. Based on the cumulative wind power installations, as of the end 
of the year 2020, the top five markets are the same. The markets are China, the 
United States, Germany, India and Spain, accounting for 73% of global wind power 
installations.

The global offshore wind industry recorded over 6 GW of new installation in 
2020, despite the effect of COVID-19. China took the lead in global new offshore 
wind installations for consecutive three years with over 3 GW of new offshore wind 
capacity recorded in 2020, as shown in Figure 1.4. In Europe, steady growth in off￾shore wind power installations was achieved, with the Netherlands taking the lead of 
nearly 1.5 GW new offshore wind power, then Belgium with 706 MW, the UK with 
483 MW and Germany with 237 MW, respectively. Apart from China and Europe,

1.2 CLASSIFICATION OF WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM
Wind energy conversion systems can be classified as follows.
(1) They are two broad classifications based on the axis of the machine:
(a) Horizontal Axis Machines: The axis of rotation is horizontal and the 
aero turbine plane is vertical, facing the wind.
(b) Vertical Axis Machines: The axis of rotation is vertical. The sails or 
blades may also be vertical.
(2) They may be classified according to size:
(a) Small-scale machines (up to 2 kW): Used in low-power applications.
(b) Medium-size machines (2–100 kW)
(c) Large-scale or large-size machines (100 kW and up): Used to generate 
power for distribution in central power grids.
(3) Classification as per type of output power
(a) DC output: DC generators, Alternator rectifiers
(b) AC output: Variable frequency variable or constant voltage, constant 
frequency variable or constant voltage
1.3 OVERVIEW OF WIND TURBINE TECHNOLOGIES
Wind turbine technologies could be classified into two groups as follows: Fixed 
Speed Wind Turbines (FSWTs) and Variable Speed Wind Turbines (VSWTs). There 
has been tremendous improvement in wind energy technology over the years, as a 
result of the fast innovations and developments in power electronics [9, 10]. This has 
resulted in the replacement of FSWTs with VSWTs. The following are some of the 
features of both wind turbine technologies.
1.3.1 Fixed Speed Wind Turbines
• This class of wind turbine has a limited range of power capture because it 
operates using fixed speed.
• This class of wind turbine lacks voltage and frequency control capability.
• This class of wind turbine is rugged in construction, has low running cost, is 
maintenance-free, with operational simplicity and possesses superior brush￾less features.
• This class of wind turbine needs large reactive power compensation during 
the transient state, in order to recover the air gap flux.
• This class of wind turbine system is expensive because of the installa￾tion of external reactive power compensation devices, such as Flexible AC 
Transmission Systems (FACTS) that could be Static Synchronous Compensators 
(STATCOM), Energy Capacitor Systems (ECS) or Superconducting Magnetic 
Energy Storage System (SMES), to provide reactive power.
1.3.2 Variable Speed Wind Turbines
• This class of wind turbine has high energy conversion efficiency, during low 
and high winds because it has variable speed operation.Wind Energy Installations and Wind Turbine Technologies 7
• This class of wind turbine has less acoustic noise and mechanical stress.
• The class of wind turbine has better power quality in power grids without 
support from external reactive power compensators like the FACTS devices.
• This class of wind turbine employs power converters for secondary exci￾tation, between 20 and 30% for a DFIG system and 100% for a PMSG 
system.
• This class of wind turbine has a lower cost of operation because it can gen￾erate power to the grid and the same time help in providing reactive power 
support to achieve stability of the network.
FSWTs are based on Squirrel Cage Induction Generator (SCIG), while VSWTs 
are based on Doubly Fed Induction Generator or Permanent Magnet Synchronous 
Generator (PMSG), as shown in Figure 1.8 (a–c) for FSWTs and VSWTs, respec￾tively. A brief distinction between the three types of wind turbine-driven generators 
is given below.
1.4 OVERVIEW OF DFIG AND PMSG WIND TURBINES
Variable speed turbines are becoming the norm for new wind farm installations, 
because of high energy capture efficiency, coupled with reduced drive train stresses 
[11]. The PMSG VSWT also known as the direct-drive synchronous generator with 
DFIG

FIGURE 1.8 Wind turbine technologies. (a) Fixed speed induction generator wind turbine,

synchronous generator variable speed wind turbine.8 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
permanent magnet excitation and the DFIG VSWT, with doubly fed back-to-back 
power converter type technologies, have become the two generator alternatives. The 
former has the disadvantage of cost mainly due to a fully rated power converter 
of 100% for energy capture. Although in the latter, a gearbox is needed, the DFIG 
requires a converter of only 20–30% of the generator’s rating for an operating speed 
range of 0.7–1.3 per unit (p.u), resulting in a lower cost. This book would be focus￾ing on the DFIG and PMSG VSWTs, since modern wind farms are built using both 
wind turbines.
Although the DFIG is not as rugged and robust as the squirrel-cage wind tur￾bine type, its brushes have little wear and sparking when compared to DC machines 
and it is the only acceptable option for alternative energy conversion in the mega￾watts power range. With the help of modern power electronic devices, it is possible 
to recover the slip power dissipated in resistances [12]. The DFIG wind turbine 
uses a back-to-back power inverter system connected between the rotor side and 
the grid side of the machine, while the stator is directly connected to the grid. The 
DFIG can effectively operate at a wide range of speeds, based on the available 
wind speed and other specific operational requirements. Thus, it allows for better 
capture of wind energy [13, 14], and dynamic slip and pitch control may contribute 
to rebuilding the voltage at the wind turbine terminals and, at the same time, main￾taining the power system stability after clearance of an external short-circuit fault 
[15]. Besides, DFIG wind turbine has shown better behavior regarding system 
stability during short-circuit faults in comparison to SCIG, because of its ability to 
decouple the control of active and reactive power output. The superior dynamic 
performance of the DFIG is achieved from the frequency or power converters 
which typically operate with sampling and switching frequencies of above 2 kHz 
[16]. At lower voltages down to 0%, the IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) 
of the DFIG are switched off and the system remains in standby mode [17–21]. If 
the voltages are above a certain cutoff or threshold value during grid disturbances, 
the DFIG wind turbine system is very quickly synchronized and is back in opera￾tion again.
The VSWT PMSG is connected through a back-to-back converter to the grid. The 
PMSG wind turbine is tied via the Grid Side Converter (GSC), control systems and 
Machine Side Converter (MSC) to the power network. This provides maximum flex￾ibility, enabling full real and reactive power control and fault ride through capability 
during voltage dips, as compared to the VSWT DFIG technology. However, the use 
of this wind turbine technology is limited when compared to the DFIG technology 
due to high cost. Compared to the widely used DFIG wind turbine, the PMSG-based 
VSWT has a more feasible technology that is promising in wind generation because 
it is self-excited, hence, is possible to operate with higher efficiency and power fac￾tor. Besides, there is no gearbox system because of its low rotational speed. 
Therefore, no careful and regular maintenance is required in this wind turbine topol￾ogy, unlike the DFIG-based wind turbine [22]. In addition, the converters have room 
for flexible control of active and reactive dissipation of power in normal and tran￾sient states [23, 24]. However, some drawbacks of the PMSG wind turbine are com￾plex construction and controller control strategy, compared to the traditional FSWT 
based on SCIGs.Wind Energy Installations and Wind Turbine Technologies 9
1.5 DFIG WIND TURBINE MODELING
A wind turbine is an electromechanical energy conversion device that captures kinetic 
energy from the wind and turns it into electrical energy. The primary components of 
a wind turbine for modeling purposes consist of the turbine rotor or prime mover, 
a shaft and a gearbox unit (a speed changer) [25]. The dynamics interaction involv￾ing forces from the wind and the response of wind turbine determines the amount 
of kinetic energy that can be extracted. The aerodynamic torque and the mechanical 
power of a wind turbine are given as follows [26–28].

a way that the pitch controller shown in Figure 1.12 controls the angle when the rotor 
speed exceeds 1.3 pu for the case of DFIG that operates in variable speed mode. 
Figure 1.13 shows the pitch controller for the fixed speed Wind Turbine Generator 
System (WTGS). In order to get a realistic response in the pitch angle control system, 
the servomechanism accounts for a servo time constant, Tservo and a limitation of both 
the pitch angle and its rate of change, as shown in Figures 1.12 and 1.13, respectively. 
The rate of change limitation is very important during grid fault, because it decides 
how fast the aerodynamic power can be reduced in order to prevent over-speeding 
during fault [30, 31]. Considering the realistic scenario for a heavy mechanical sys￾tem, the rate limiter must be incorporated to simulate the pitch controller. Therefore 
the pitch rate limiter of ±10 deg./sec. is used for both pitch controllers in this text.
1.6 PMSG WIND TURBINE MODELING
The PMSG turbine is made up of a generator blade, system controller, components of 
power electronics and transformer [32]. The wind turbine is tied to the power grid via 
its back-to-back full-power converters that are capable of converting wind into elec￾trical energy. To realize wind energy maximum power tracking [33, 34], the motor 
speed or torque of the wind generator is controlled by the MSC. The stabilization of 
the voltage of the DC-link and regulation of the power factor and quality of the wind 
generator is done basically by the GSC.
The mechanical power extracted by the wind generator can be expressed as [35]:

1.7 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
Recently, the penetration of wind energy into power grids is on the rise globally. 
This is evident from the wind energy installation statistics presented in this chapter, 
considering the various regions in the world and the top markets for wind energy. 
China and Asia Pacific continue to take the lead in global wind power developments, 
increasing its global market region by 8.5% in recent years. The USA and North 
America have a global market share of 18.4% and have recently replaced Europe 
with 15.9% as the second-largest regional market for new wind power installations. 
Latin America with 5.0% and Africa and the Middle East region with 0.9% hold the 
fourth and fifth positions in global wind installations, respectively. China, the USA, 
Brazil, the Netherlands and Germany have 80.6% of global wind power installa￾tions. The recent top five countries in wind power installations are China, the USA, 
Germany, India and Spain, possessing 73% of global wind power installations.
The VSWT technology is superior to the fixed speed with turbine technology in 
wind energy conversion system due to their high wind energy capture efficiency. The 
DFIG and the PMSG are the two main types of VSWTs employed in modern wind 
farms. This chapter presented the basic modeling of both wind turbines considering 
their MPPT characteristics.

2.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
In wind energy applications, the Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) has one 
main merit of utilizing only 20–30% of the wind generator rating for the power 
converters linking the rotor side and the grid side [1, 2]. Lately, the use of Insulated 
Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) is on the rise for high-power applications among 
semiconductor devices. This is because the current capability of the IGBT switches 
can be increased by configuring them in parallel connection [3]. Because the IGBT 
switches have high power and are required to be subjected to high voltage and cur￾rent, their transient operations during periods of several microseconds are vital [4, 5]. 
Therefore, the ability for variable speed wind turbine IGBT based on withstanding 
abnormal conditions is strictly paramount to achieve the lifetime specifications [6, 
7] of the wind turbine and at the same time to fulfill the requirement of grid codes.
As the use of multilevel converters is becoming popular in wind energy conver￾sion systems, because of their robustness during transient conditions, this chapter 
tends to improve the performance of the six-step 2-level IGBT inverter by proposing 
a coordinated hybrid control of a new Phase Lock Loop (PLL) configuration and a 
Series Dynamic Braking Resistor (SDBR). The high voltage usually experienced 
during grid disturbances is shared by the small inserted resistance because of the 
series connection strategy of the braking resistor employed in this study. Thus, the 
loss of the converter control system is not experienced in this topology due to the 
effects of induced overvoltage. In addition, the series-connected braking resistor 
strategy significantly reduces the very high current in the rotor circuitry of the wind 
generator to lower values. Consequently, the overvoltage of the DC-link that was 
supposed to be dangerous to the power converters of the wind generator is avoided 
because of the low DC-link capacitor charging current [8–10]. Although many stud￾ies in the literature considered the use of fault current limiter for enhancing power 
quality and limiting fault current of DFIG wind turbines in wind farms [11–13], in 
this chapter, the preferred position of the braking resistor in the wind generator sys￾tem was analyzed considering different switching signals. The optimal braking resis￾tor position and switching strategy were used for further analysis of the proposed 
wind generator schemes used in this study. In addition, a comparative study using the 
proposed scheme for the 2-level IGBT inverter was carried out with the schemes hav￾ing parallel interleaved IGBT inverter and 3-level IGBT inverter. Simulations were 
run in PSCAD/EMTDC [14]. The proposed hybrid scheme could help to increase the 
current capability and post-fault recovery of the wind turbine. In addition, the space 
vector modulation of the inverter schemes resulted in maximum value change in 
Common Mode (CM) voltage, using the proposed hybrid control strategy of the PLL 
DFIG with Different 
Inverter Schemes 218 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
and SDBR scheme [15]. Consequently, there is improved switched output voltage of 
the converter leg of the voltage source converter. The results show that the hybrid 
scheme in the various inverter topologies considered in the study can enhance the 
performance of the wind generator variables during severe three-phase-to-grid fault.
2.2 MODEL SYSTEM OF STUDY
The model system of study is shown in Figure 2.1. The DFIG wind turbine model￾ing can be referred to in Chapter 1 of this book. In Figure 2.1, the rotor side (A), 
the grid side (B) and the stator side (C) of the wind generator show the insertion of 
the proposed braking resistor scheme in a series connection, respectively. A three￾phase-to-ground fault was used to investigate the optimal position of the braking 
resistor considering the model system of study in Figure 2.1, which is connected to 
an infinite bus. Figure 2.2 shows the various control signals, DC-link voltage, current 
of the rotor for the wind generator and terminal voltage of the grid, along with the 
conditions of operation of the braking resistor. The optimal position and switching 
strategy of the braking resistor in the wind generator were used for further analysis 
of the inverter schemes proposed in this chapter.

2.3 VARIABLE SPEED DRIVE CONTROL
Figure 2.3 shows the control strategy of the DFIG-based variable speed wind turbine. 
The cost of the crowbar protection scheme used in a conventional DFIG system is 
more than the other schemes like the braking resistor or DC chopper. During grid 
fault, the crowbar makes the variable speed wind generator based on DFIG act like 
a fixed speed wind generator. This is done by disconnecting the wind generator’s 
rotor side converter. In this chapter, the DC-link (chopper) scheme is the alternative 
employed in place of the traditional crowbar switch, as shown in Figure 2.3. The 
coordinated controls of the active and reactive power of the DFIG system via abc 
to dq and dq to abc conversion to generate pulses for the switching of the PWM are 
shown in Figure 2.3.
The new PLL control strategy used in this study has a delay element incorporated 
to improve the performance of the DFIG system. The PLL scheme is designed based

on a frequency of 50 Hz and is rated line-to-line voltage of 0.69 kV. Unlike the con￾ventional PLL scheme, the proposed PLL scheme in this chapter integrates the Sine 
and Cosine function angles for the three phases via a multiplier before the insertion 
of a delay element, in order to boost its synchronizing strength with the grid for better 
performance during transient state.
Figure 2.4 shows the conventional three-phase PLL scheme, which is basically an 
error signal feedback system based on the principle of a synchronous rotating frame, 
with low pass filters and voltage-controlled oscillator. The working principle is based 
on the conversion of the measured voltage of a three-phase system to d-q component 
via conversion coordinate and set DC voltage reference of q-axis vref. Figure 2.5
shows the vector partition diagram for the PLL. From Figure 2.5, the d-axis compo￾nent is fully co-phased with the vector voltage when the q-axis component is zero, 
despite the values of the voltages on the various q-axes. The Proportional Integral 
(PI) controller in Figure 2.4 helps in obtaining the frequency of the system. With the 
grid voltage having only positive sequence fundamental components, the d-q steady 
value coordinate is DC current and its phase and frequency can be locked by

controlling the q-axis component to zero. Frequency detection when the grid voltage 
is balanced is achieved for the conventional three-phase PLL based on tracking the 
grid voltage positive sequence fundamental components, as the inner of the PLL is 
closed loop controller. However, during the transient state, there will be a sudden 
change giving rise to instantaneous negative sequence and zero sequence fundamen￾tal components, which leads to the oscillation of the PLL output angle.
In the course of the grid voltage being unbalanced, there exist positive, negative 
and zero sequence fundamental components. For a typical three-phase system with￾out a neutral point, the zero sequence is not usually considered. Thus, the grid volt￾age can be expressed as [16]:

From Equation (2.8), it could be observed that synchronous sequence due to the 
positive system coordinates enables the conversion to DC components from the posi￾tive sequence, and for the components of the negative sequence, a value that is twice 
the frequency component is obtainable. This is because the traditional PI controller 
can only be used to remove the steady state error, thus the negative voltage will have 
an influence on the output of the PLL.
The traditional PLL strategy has a negative sequence component during transient 
conditions in the grid. Therefore, a low loop filter cutoff frequency is required to help 
achieve improved performance of the system during steady state. Based on this, since 
the transient performance of the system would also be affected, this study aims to 
propose a new configuration and control topology of PLL with a delay element, as 
shown in Figure 2.6, in order to overcome this drawback. The negative effects due to 
the component of the voltage sequence would be greatly mitigated during transient 
conditions in the grid with the help of the delay element e−sT.
The principle of the delay element is based on phase shifting after abc/dq transfor￾mation in controller, as shown in Figure 2.6, compared to the traditional strategy 
employed for the PLL in Figure 2.4. The proposed control PLL scheme would coun￾teract twice the grid frequency disturbances based on Equation (2.9).

2.4 DFIG NEUTRAL POINT CLAMPED MULTILEVEL CONVERTER 
TOPOLOGY
Figure 2.7 shows the model system for the DFIG wind generator NPC MLC topol￾ogy. The NPC has three legs, A, B and C with three different voltage states. Switches 
1 and 3 are complementary on each leg, therefore, when switch 1 is on, switch 3 is 
off and the other way round. Similarly switches 2 and 4 are complementary. From 
Figure 2.7, each of the capacitors has a constant voltage of 0.5Vdc, therefore having DFIG with Different Inverter Schemes 23
the two upper switches on will lead to an output voltage of Vdc, compared to 0 level. 
Also, when switches 2 and 3 are on, it would lead to 0.5Vdc and having the two lower 
switches on leads to an output voltage level of 0. There exists a forbidden state whose 
scenario is when the first switch is on and the second is off, in addition to the three 
states. Table 2.1 shows the bridge leg voltages at different combinations of the switch 
states. The excitation parameters of the DC circuitry and the DFIG wind generator 
parameters are given in [19].

geometry in region 1, as shown in Figure 2.10. The connections of the passive filters 
of the grid side to the parallel interleaved MLC are shown in the model system. The 
reduction of the harmonics is achieved by the grid filters of value 9.6 mH and also 
with the help of the CM inductor. The IGBTs are numbered for both RSC and GSC 
power converters.

For the operation of the two-level conventional space vector modulation, the con￾verters cycles through a switching cycle with four switch states. However, for the 180 
degrees parallel interleaved MLC scheme, its space vector modulation gives voltage 
and the CM changes with a peak value to ±Vdc, whereas for the clamped Discontinuous 
Pulse width Modulation (DPWM) schemes, this value is ± 2
3
Vdc . The common leg 
flux can be mitigated by the time integral reduction of the CM voltage change. 
Avoiding the zero vector voltage would help achieve this purpose. In this chapter, the 
Near State PWM scheme having three nearest active voltage vectors to synthesize the 
reference voltage vector 
Vref is used. The table of switching sequence in Figure 2.9, 
for the parallel interleaved MLC is formulated by the vector space diagram in Figure 
2.10, with six regions, like the NPC MLC scheme earlier discussed. The formulation 
considers the voltage vectors corresponding to the sequence numbers. However, in 
the parallel interleaved MLC scheme, the 612 sequence of switching is employed in 
sub-sector 1, for 0° ≤ ϕ ≤ 30° and sub-sector 12, for 330° ≤ ϕ ≤ 360°. Region 1 is 
formulated by the geometry for the voltage of reference 
Vref , as shown in Figure 2.10.

The DFIG parallel interleaved MLC switching sequence and CM voltages are 
shown in Figure 2.11 for both converter sides. The converter’s two halves are tagged 
A and B, respectively. With a voltage common to each voltage source converter, the 
maximum individual VSCs CM voltage is constrained to ±Vdc
6 .VCM, A and VCM, B 
and their difference ∆VCM is shown in Figure 2.11. Since only active vectors are 
used in this topology, the peak CM voltage of the individual VSCs is constrained to 
±
Vdc
6 . The CM voltages polarity are equal but opposite for the power converters 
scheme. Due to the individual CM voltages opposite polarity, the combined use of 

2.6 SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
2.6.1 SDBR Switching and Position
Simulations were done based on the optimal switching signal (Figure 2.2) and place￾ment (Figure 2.1) of SDBR having a value of 0.01 pu for a severe 3LG fault which 
occurs at 0.1 s. The 2-level inverter scheme having a DC chopper was used in this 
investigation. As seen from Figures 2.12–2.14 the following wind generator vari￾ables, DC-link voltage, active power and reactive power show improved performance

with low distortions, with the use of the braking resistor, when subjected to transient 
conditions. This was mainly due to the fact that most of the harmonics and vibrations 
experienced during the transient period were transferred by the rotor current and DC￾link voltage signals to the braking resistor circuitry, compared to when the grid volt￾age signal was employed. The scenario where the braking resistor was inserted at the 
stator side of the wind generator, considering the grid voltage switching signal, led to 
enhanced performance of the terminal voltage and rotor speed variables of the wind

generator (Figures 2.15 and 2.16). The reason for this is that the wind generator’s 
active power was enhanced and, consequently, its stability was improved. Besides, 
the braking resistor limits the rotor speed at times of transient, thus, improving the 
power output of the wind turbine. Consequently, the recovery of the variables of the 
wind generator after fault is better because of the control capability of the braking 
resistor in the acceleration of the rotor speed.
2.6.2 2-Level Interleaved Inverter and SDBR
A comparison was made between the single 2-Level Converter (2LC) system and 
when it is interleaved for the wind turbine system. As seen from Figures 2.17 and 
2.18 for the DC-link voltage and reactive power of the wind generator, interleaving 
the two side converters using the 2LCs enhances the stability of the wind turbine 
during transient by providing more reactive power within the DFIG power convert￾ers (Figure 2.18). Based on the best SDBR performance for the stator side, as given 
in Section 2.6.1 of the simulation results, a further investigation was carried out for 
the 2-level interleave inverter system to improve the stability of the wind turbine for 
the DC-link voltage and the rotor speed variables shown in Figures 2.19 and 2.20,

scenario, in order to avoid the undervoltage or overvoltage experienced, as shown in 
Figure 2.19. In addition, this topology effectively controls the voltage and current 
in the rotor circuitry. This would definitely improve the rotor speed of the DFIG, as 
shown in Figure 2.20.

2.6.3 3-Level Inverter, 2-Level Interleaved Inverter and SDBR
Investigation was further carried out by comparing the responses of the 3-level 
inverter and the 2-level interleaved inverter. The responses of the DFIG DC-link volt￾age and active power in Figures 2.21 and 2.22, respectively, are better for the 2-level 
interleaved inverter than the 3-level inverter due to more reactive power supplied, as 
shown in Figure 2.23. However, the response of the rotor current is almost the same

but in a different direction, as shown in Figure 2.24, for both converter systems. An 
addition of SDBR to both systems, as shown in Figures 2.25–2.28, indicates that the 
SDBR can further enhance the performance of both inverter schemes, for the DC￾link voltage, real power, reactive power of the grid side converter and rotor speed of 
the wind generator. The response of the 2-level interleave inverter is slightly better 
because the SDBR limits the reactive power even more (Figure 2.27) for the 3-level 
inverter.

2.6.4 Proposed PLL Control Strategy and the Various Schemes
The conventional PLL was used in the earlier analysis of the DFIG wind turbine in 
this chapter. This section investigates five different schemes for the DFIG wind tur￾bine. Scheme 1 is the 2LC using the conventional PLL, scheme 2 is the 2LC with the 
proposed PLL scheme in Figure 2.6 and scheme 3 is the 2LC with the proposed PLL

scheme and SDBR. Schemes 4 and 5 use the 3-Level Converter (3LC) and parallel 
Interleave Converter (IC), having the proposed PLL scheme and SDBR, respectively. 
Figure 2.29 shows the response of the DFIG wind turbine DC-link voltage consid￾ering the various converter schemes without SDBR. The response of the DC-link 
voltage using the proposed PLL scheme for the 2LC system is better than when 
the conventional PLL scheme was used. This is because the proposed PLL scheme 
helps in enhancing the reactive power of the DFIG grid side converter (Figure 2.30). 
The coordinated control of SDBR with the proposed scheme shows that better per￾formance of the wind turbine variables could be achieved during transient for the 
DC-link, real power and rotor speed of the wind generator, as shown in Figures 
2.31–2.33. In Figure 2.31, the SDBR and the proposed PLL scheme enhance the 
single-step 2-level inverter, thus, giving a better response than the interleaved and 
3-level inverter schemes. This is also the same for the wind turbine real power in 
Figure 2.32 and rotor speed in Figure 2.33, respectively.
2.7 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
In this chapter, the DFIG variable speed wind turbine performance operating with 
three types of inverter system was investigated. The 2-level single-step inverters, 
2-level parallel interleaved inverters and 3-level inverter systems for a DFIG wind

improve the performance of the wind turbine using a 2-level single-step inverter 
system. It was observed that the proposed PLL SDBR strategy can further improve 
the performance of the 2-level single-step inverter system during transient, thus 
enhancing the transient responses of the wind turbine.

3.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
This chapter tends to improve the performance of the DFIG-based wind turbine, by 
investigating the effects of the excitation parameters of the power converter Insulated 
Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) of the DFIG wind turbine during transient condi￾tions. The excitation parameters of the IGBTs investigated are the turn-on and turn￾off resistances, forward break over and reverse withstand voltages. An extensive 
analysis of the effects of the excitation parameters of the IGBTs was carried out 
considering 15 scenarios. The IGBT turn-on resistance has a considerable effect on 
the responses of the wind generator’s variables, while its turn-off resistance has little 
or minimal effects on the variables of the wind generator [1]. However, the forward 
break over and reverse withstand voltages of the IGBT have no effects on the per￾formance of the wind generator variables during transient conditions. The optimal 
excitation parameters that gave the best responses of the wind generator variables 
during transient were used to further analyze the performance of the wind genera￾tor, by proposing a hybrid coordinated control of a new Phase Lock Loop (PLL) 
configuration and the SDBR. The proposed PLL control is based on a delayed signal 
that helps the phase of the positive sequence component to be obtained quickly and 
accurately, despite the grid voltage being disturbed. Hence, it has a better tracking 
of the positive components of the grid voltage, compared to the conventional PLL. 
The SDBR mitigates the overvoltage experienced in the rotor circuitry and the rotor 
high currents. Thus, the wind generator’s power converter is intact during operation 
because these actions would eliminate the capacitor’s DC-link high charging cur￾rent, which is dangerous to the power converters. In this chapter, optimum size and 
placement of the braking resistor in the wind generator were used in enhancing the 
wind generator during transient, in conjunction with the proposed PLL scheme for 
the DFIG wind generator, as earlier discussed in Chapter 2 of this book. In addition, 
a comparative study using the proposed hybrid scheme and the conventional PLL 
DFIG scheme was presented. Results obtained using the proposed control strategies 
for the DFIG during severe three-phase fault scenario were better than those using 
the conventional PLL scheme. Simulations were run in PSCAD/EMTDC [2].
3.2 MODEL SYSTEM OF STUDY
The model system of study is shown in Figure 3.1. The DFIG wind turbine model￾ing is already presented in Chapter 1. The best SDBR position, switching signal and 
control strategy were evaluated considering the most severe fault scenario of 3 LG in 
Figure 3.1, model system [3]. The optimum size of the SDBR, duration of operation 
DFIG Performance and 
Excitation Parameters 340 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
and best switching signals were investigated already in [4, 5]. The best SDBR size 
of 0.05 pu, with grid voltage switching signal topology for the DFIG during tran￾sient conditions, was used for further investigation, considering the proposed PLL 
scheme. The parameters of the DFIG wind generator are given in Table 3.1.
3.3 DFIG VARIABLE SPEED DRIVE CONTROL
Figure 3.2 shows the classical configuration and power flow of a wind generator 
based on DFIG technology, with bidirectional power converters. The utilization of 
the voltage source converters in an economical way is one of the important features 
of this type of wind turbine. This is because unlike the synchronous wind generators 
that employ full converter rating, only the power electronic rotor circuitry is required 
in the case of DFIG wind turbines. During normal operation, the optimal power of the 
wind generator is achieved considering the conditions of the wind power. The maxi￾mum power point tracking characteristics of the wind generator is directly related to 
its d-axis reference current. The regulation of active power of the wind generator is 
possible via the control of the pitch angle. This is done by frequency control and grid 
support based on the provision of power margins. From Figure 3.2, the DC-link volt￾age is maintained constant at 1.0 pu, by the regulation of the quadrature axis current,

of the excitation parameters and their respective ratings, investigated in this chapter.
The turn-on and turn-off resistances, forward break over and reverse withstand 
voltages excitation parameters of the IGBTs were investigated considering the vari￾ous scenarios shown in Table 3.2. The IGBT turn-on resistance has a considerable 
effect on the responses of the wind generator’s variables, while its turn-off resistance 
has little or minimal effects on the variables of the wind generator. These would be

demonstrated in the simulation results and discussion section of this chapter. The 
forward break over and reverse withstand voltages of the IGBT have no effect on the 
performance of the wind generator variables, during transient conditions. Thus, the 
variation of the forward break over and reverse withstand voltages of the wind gen￾erator power converter does not contribute to the wind turbine enhancement during 
steady state and grid fault conditions. The optimal excitation parameters that gave the 
best responses of the wind generator variables during transient were used for further 
analysis of the wind turbine considering the new PLL scheme that was proposed in 
Chapter 2 of this book.
3.5 FAULT RIDE THROUGH REQUIREMENTS FOR WIND FARMS
Wind farms are faced with drops in voltage during fault scenarios. Since the grid 
voltage depends on reactive power injection, recent grid codes require immediate 
restoration of operation of the wind farms after grid faults, as shown in Figure 3.4
[6, 7]. The grid codes stipulate that within the time frame shown in the figure, the 
collapse in voltage of the wind farm must be regulated to normal, for the wind farm 
to stay in the grid. Otherwise, the wind farm must be shut down or disconnected.
3.6 EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
3.6.1 Effects of the Insulated Gate Bipolar Excitation Parameters on the
DFIG Wind Turbine
The effects of the excitation parameters on the DFIG variable speed wind turbine 
responses considering a severe bolted three-phase-to-ground fault were investigated

in this section based on the different scenarios given in Table 3.2. Some of the simu￾lation results of the DFIG variables are presented in Figures 3.5–3.17.
Figure 3.5 shows the response of the DFIG wind turbine DC-link voltage for the 
first three scenarios of Table 3.2. With a too-high IGBT turn-on resistance of 0.003 
Ohms, the DC-link variable of the wind generator did not recover on time, while a 
too-low resistance of 0.001 Ohms gives a faster recovery of the wind generator DC￾link voltage. However, there is an overshoot of the DC-link variable considering the

better response of the DFIG wind generator variables during a severe three-phase-to￾ground fault could be achieved, when the turn-on resistance of the IGBTs of the 
power converter is of value 0.002 Ohms. It should be noted that, in the investigation 
of the effects of the turn-on resistance of the IGBT, the other excitation parameters 
were kept constant.
A further analysis was carried out considering scenarios 4–9 in Table 3.1, by vary￾ing the turn-on and turn-off resistances of the IGBTs, while keeping constant the

conditions.

Table 3.1 were considered by varying the forward break over voltage and reverse 
withstand voltage, while keeping the turn-off resistance of the IGBTs constant, as 
shown in Figures 3.13 and 3.14, respectively.
From Figures 3.13 and 3.14, the forward break over voltage and reverse withstand 
voltage of the power converter of the IGBTs do not have any effects on the DC-link 
voltage and terminal voltage variables of the DFIG wind turbine. In light of the 
above, only the IGBT’s turn-on resistance has a great impact on the variables of the 
wind generator. Thus, the optimal value of 0.002 Ohms turn-on resistance and the 
IGBTs excitation parameters considering scenario 2 of Table 3.2, would be used for 
further analysis of the new PLL scheme proposed for the DFIG wind turbine in the 
subsequent section of this chapter.
3.7 PROPOSED PLL CONTROL STRATEGY AND SDBR SCHEME
Based on the optimal performance of the excitation parameters for the power con￾verter IGBTs of the DFIG wind turbine presented in Section 3.6.1, a further inves￾tigation was carried out to improve the stability of the DFIG wind turbine using the 
new PLL scheme, in conjunction with the SDBR control strategy. Simulations were 
run for three scenarios in this section. In the first scenario, the conventional PLL 
scheme was used for the DFIG wind generator, while the second scenario uses the 
new PLL scheme for the DFIG wind generator. The combination of the proposed 
PLL scheme and best control strategies of the SDBR was used in the third scenario 
to improve the stability of the wind generator during transient condition. Some of the 
DFIG variables for these analyses are shown in Figures 3.15–3.17, for a three-phase￾to-ground severe fault.
Figure 3.15 shows the response of the DFIG wind turbine DC-link voltage for the 
conventional PLL scheme and the new PLL scheme. It could be observed from the 
figure that the proposed PLL scheme helps in enhancing the performance of the DC￾link voltage during transient with the help of the delay element, as discussed earlier. 
A further investigation of using the new PLL scheme and the best working conditions 
of the SDBR improved the variables of the wind generator during transient condition. 
The reasons for this improved performance are based on the benefits of the SDBR 
earlier given for the limitation of the rotor overvoltage and current of the rotor

circuitry of the wind generator, as shown in Figure 3.15. As a result, the real power 
and rotor speed are enhanced in Figures 3.16 and 3.17. The wind turbine power can 
be improved using the braking resistor because the rotor speed can be limited with 
few oscillations during fault scenarios, as shown in Figure 3.17. Therefore, the com￾bination of the proposed PLL scheme and the best working conditions and control 
strategy of the SDBR will improve the post-fault recovery of the DFIG wind turbine 
system variables. The comparison of the proposed PLL scheme to traditional PLL 
solutions in the literature is given in Table 3.3.
3.8 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
The performance of a DFIG variable speed wind turbine using a coordinated control 
strategy of the optimal excitation parameters of the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors 
(IGBTs), a new PLL and Series Dynamic Braking Resistor (SDBR), during grid fault 
has been investigated in this chapter. The responses of the DFIG variables during 
transient conditions using the hybrid control strategies of the excitation parameters 
of the IGBTs, SDBR and the new PLL scheme were better than the conventional 
PLL scheme. The IGBTs turn-on resistance has a lot of impact on the DFIG variables 
during transient compared to the other excitation parameters such as the turn-off 
resistance, forward break over voltage and reverse withstand voltage. When the turn￾on resistance is too high or low, the variables of the wind generator cause overshoot 
or are too slow to recover after the grid fault. A well sized and positioned SDBR in 
the stator side of the wind generator was used to enhance the performance of the new

4.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Based on the recent emerging grid requirements, wind farms are expected to have 
good performance under grid fault, considering the capability of voltage control. 
There are bound to be intricacies in operating the power grid smoothly, due to grid 
disturbances. Consequently, it is necessary to proffer solutions using new tech￾niques to overcome this shortcoming, considering the complex nature of the con￾trol strategies of modern power grids [1]. The topologies of Variable Speed Wind 
Turbine (VSWT) have various generator and converter schemes with regard to 
capturing of energy, cost, efficiency and control strategies complexity [2]. The two 
most commonly used VSWTs for wind energy conversion in modern wind farms 
are the Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) wind turbine and the Permanent 
Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG)-based VSWT. Though the earlier wind 
turbine is more popular, the later wind turbine technology has a more feasible wind 
generation technology, making it more promising due to its self-excited nature; 
hence, it is possible to operate higher efficiency and power factor. Besides, the 
PMSG technology has no gearbox system because of its low rotational speed. 
Therefore, no careful and regular maintenance is required in this wind turbine 
topology, unlike the DFIG-based wind turbine [3]. More so, the PMSG wind tur￾bine power converters have room for flexible control of active and reactive power 
dissipation during transient conditions [4, 5]. This type of wind turbine technology 
has a full-rated back-to-back power converter tied to the grid. As a result, com￾pared to the earlier wind turbine topology, the flexibility in the later type of wind 
turbine is maximum, making the control of real and reactive power more effective. 
However, some challenges of the PMSG wind turbine are high cost, construction 
and control strategy complexities.
In the literature, there are many reports on the control strategies and fault ride 
through topologies concerning PMSG wind turbines. Nasiri and Mohammadi [6] 
enhanced the PMSG wind turbine considering its peak current limitation, while a 
control strategy based on the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for both 
power converters was used in [7]. Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) 
was used in [8] to improve the performance of the PMSG wind turbine during grid 
fault. The use of expensive Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) in [9] and 
DC braking chopper Fault Ride Through (FRT) solution in [10–12], are some of the 
most common control strategies employed in enhancing the performance of the 
PMSG wind turbine during transient state.
Furthermore, soft computing techniques have been extended to the PMSG wind 
turbine control topology. In [13], the fuzzy logic controller was employed for 
PMSG Performance and 
Excitation Parameters 452 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
the PMSG, with some benefits over conventional controllers of the wind generator. 
The drawback of this computing scheme is the architecture and low sensitivity level 
to parameter variation. A combined approach of using conventional Proportional 
Integral Derivative (PID) controllers with the soft computing scheme of fuzzy logic 
was carried out in [4], for improved performance of the PMSG wind generator. Some 
more complex soft computing techniques were extended for the PMSG wind turbine 
by implementing linear observer extended state in [14] and fuzzy adaptive strategy in 
[15], respectively.
A dynamic voltage restorer was used to improve the performance of the PMSG 
wind generator in [16]. In the literature, an SFCL that is modified considering flux￾coupling was used to enhance the FRT performance of the PMSG wind turbine. The 
principle and theoretical influence of the modified SFCL structure on the PMSG ride 
through capability were conducted and a comparison of the SFCL with a dynamic 
braking chopper was performed in [17]. In [18], a resistive SFCL was employed as 
an additional self-healing mechanism to support large wind power plant, in order to 
enhance the rated active power of the PMSG wind turbine. The scheme was also able 
to improve the DC-link voltage smoothness and the Low Voltage Ride Through 
(LVRT) capability of the wind generator. A cooperative strategy that is integrated 
with a cost-effective Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) unit, con￾sidering two modified wind turbine generator control strategies was presented in 
[19]. In that study, the effective utilization of SMES system was achieved during grid 
faults based on the overvoltage-suppressing effect in the DC-link of the wind genera￾tor. A new Multi-Step Bridge-type Fault Current Limiter (MSBFCL) PMSG FRT 
enhancement was presented in [20]. The multi-resistors were connected in parallel 
with the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) switches and were employed to 
provide a controllable discrete step resistance.
Though these enhancement schemes highlighted above were able to improve the 
performance of the PMSG wind turbine during transient state, however, they are 
additional circuitries to the PMSG wind turbines. In this regard, this chapter tends to 
propose a simple and cost-effective FRT solution for the PMSG wind generator. The 
effects of the excitation parameters of the power converter’s IGBTs of the PMSG 
with turbine during transient condition was investigated. The excitation parameters 
of the IGBTs that were investigated include the turn-on and turn-off resistances. It 
has already been reported in [21, 22] that the forward break over and reverse with￾stand voltages have not much effect on the transient performance of the variable 
speed wind generators. An extensive analysis of the effects of the excitation param￾eters of the IGBTs was carried out by considering three scenarios of the IGBT’s 
turn-on resistances with and without considering DC-chopper braking resistor for 
overvoltage protection of the PMSG wind turbine. The IGBT turn-on resistance has 
a significant effect on the responses of the wind generator’s variables, while its turn￾off resistance has little or minimal effects on the variables of the wind generator. The 
results obtained using the PMSG wind turbines were compared to those obtained 
using the DFIG wind turbines. The evaluation of the system performance was carried 
out using Power System Computer Design and Electromagnetic Transient Including 
DC (PSCAD/EMTDC).PMSG Performance and Excitation Parameters 53
4.2 MODELING OF THE PMSG WIND TURBINE
The modeling of the PMSG wind turbine can be referred to in Chapter 1 of this book. 
The parameters of the PMSG wind turbine are given in Table 4.1.
4.3 CONTROL STRATEGY FOR THE PMSG WIND TURBINE
Figure 4.1(a) shows the controller of the Machine Side Converter (MSC) of the 
PMSG that regulates both active and reactive power of the wind turbine. The abc 
to dq variables transformation is achieved via angle position rotor (θr
), considering 
the rotor speed of the wind generator. The d-axis current (Isd) regulates the active 
power (Ps), while the q-axis current (Isq) controls the reactive power (Qs) of the wind 
generator. The MPPT technique for the characteristic of the wind turbine in Chapter 
1 is employed in the reference active power (Pref). Usually, the reference reactive 
power (QS
∗
) is fixed at 0, to obtain effective operation of unity power factor. Three 
reference phase voltages (Vsa
∗
, Vsb
∗
, Vsc
∗
) are generated for the PWM switching, through 
the outputs of the current controller, based on the voltage references Vsd
∗ and Vsq
∗ . The 
GSC control of the wind generator is also shown in Figure 4.1(b) and is regulated 
considering the d-q rotating reference frame, based on the grid voltage being the 
same as the speed of rotation. The Park transformation is used in converting (Iga, Igb, 
Igc) and (Vga, Vgb, Vgc) three-phase voltage and current of the grid into their rotating 
d-q reference frame. The extraction of the phase angle (θg) of the grid side is done by 
considering the phase lock loop.
4.4 EXCITATION PARAMETERS OF THE INSULATED GATE 
BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS OF THE PMSG WIND TURBINE
The schematic diagram of the basic structure and equivalent circuit of an IGBT 
switch is shown in Figure 4.2. Table 4.2 gives the summary of the excitation param￾eters and their respective ratings, investigated in this chapter.
The operation of the IGBT in Figure 4.2 is characterized by the conductivity mod￾ulation of the n−
 region, in addition to the operation represented by the equivalent

circuit. In the IGBT circuit, the holes are the minority carriers and because they are 
injected into the n−
 region from the p n    region, conductivity modulation occurs 
in the n−
 region. From the equivalent circuit in Figure 4.2, the saturation voltage 
VCE  sat  of the IGBT can be expressed as [23]:
VCE  sat   V I BE D   R R N M  OD  ch (4.1)
From Equation (4.1):
VBE is the base-emitter voltage
ID is the drain current
RN M  OD is the resistance of the n−
 region after conductivity modulation
Rch is the channel resistance.
If the collector current and the DC gain current are IC and hFE, respectively.
Then, ID is calculated as:
I I D C = / hFE (4.2)
The total current of the IGBT I IGBT  is:
I I I IGBT   D C (4.3)
Equation (4.1) reflects that the saturation voltage VCE  sat of an IGBT depends on ID
, which is a direct function of hFE in Equation (4.2). From Equation (4.1), increasing 
the resistance in the n−
 region would result in conductivity modulation of the IGBT 
in the PMSG wind turbine.
The ratings of the turn-on and turn-off resistances, forward break over and reverse 
withstand voltages excitation parameters of the IGBTs considered in this study for 
the three scenarios are shown in Table 4.2. The IGBT turn-on resistance has a con￾siderable effect on the responses of the PMSG wind generator’s variables, while its 
turn-off resistance has little or minimal effects on the variables of the wind generator. 
These would be demonstrated in the simulation results and discussion section of this 
chapter. The forward break over and reverse withstand voltages of the IGBT have no 
effect on the performance of the wind generator variables, during transient condi￾tions. Thus, the variation of the forward break over and reverse withstand voltages of

the wind generator power converter does not contribute to the wind turbine enhance￾ment during steady state and grid fault conditions.

this section of this chapter based on the different scenarios given in Table 4.2. Some 
of the simulation results of the PMSG variables are presented in Figures 4.3–4.7.
The system performance was evaluated using PSCAD/EMTDC [24] environ￾ment. The fault type is a severe three-phase of 100 ms happening at 10.1 s, with the 
circuit breakers operation sequence opening and reclosing at 10.2 s and 11 s, respec￾tively, on the faulted line at the terminals of the PMSG wind turbine. Figure 4.3
shows the response of the PMSG wind turbine DC-link voltage for the three sce￾narios in Table 4.2. With a high IGBT turn-on resistance of 0.003 Ohms in scenario 
3, the DC-link variable of the wind generator recovered on time, compared to a low

voltage and reverse withstand voltage were kept constant in the course of the study. 
In Figure 4.4, the terminal voltage for scenarios 1 and 2 gave more voltage over￾shoot and dip, with less settling time than scenario 3. In Figure 4.5, the response of 
the active power of the wind generator was better controlled in scenario 3, with less 
over shot, few oscillations and faster settling time. The PMSG reactive power dis￾sipation was more for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively, in Figure 4.6. While in

scenario 3, the higher resistance value of the turn-on resistance was able to limit the 
reactive power dissipation within the power converter limit. In Figure 4.7, the rotor 
speed of the wind generator recovered faster for scenario 3, with less overshoot and 
oscillations, compared to the other scenarios. Scenarios 1 and 2 show a huge depres￾sion and recovery of the wind generator rotor speed, compared to scenario 3 with 
mitigated effects of the grid fault on the rotor speed during transient state. This is 
because an increase in the turn-on resistance of the IGBTs of the PMSG wind tur￾bine power converters would decrease the circulation of currents and boost the capa￾bility of the switching mode of the converter’s legs during transient state. Hence, 
this topology could be a cheaper way to enhance the FRT of the PMSG VSWT dur￾ing transient condition.
4.5.2 Effects of the Insulated Gate Bipolar Excitation Parameters on the
PMSG Considering Overvoltage Protection Scheme (OVPS)
A further investigation was carried out for the three scenarios, using the same condi￾tions in Section 4.5.1, of this chapter, considering the use of DC-chopper braking 
resistor for 110% overvoltage protection, as shown in Table 4.1. The PMSG variables 
for this case are shown in Figures 4.8–4.12.

From Figure 4.8, with the help of the DC-chopper connected at the GSC of the 
PMSG with turbine, the DC-link voltage was maintained within the permissible limit 
of 110% as set in Table 4.1, for all the scenarios. It could be observed from Figure 4.8
that the DC-link OVPS was able to mitigate the effects of the grid disturbance, oscil￾lations, overshoot and undershoot, for scenario 3, which is usually caused by grid 
fault, due to the fragile nature of the power converters of the wind generator. Thus, 
the vulnerable power converters of the wind generator are protected during transient

state. The response of the terminal voltage of the wind generator’s variable in Figure 
4.9 indicates that the OVPS scheme could help reduce the voltage dip and overshoot 
in the terminal voltage of the wind turbine for scenario 3. A smoother active power 
of the wind generator was achieved for scenario 3 in Figure 4.10, because the effec￾tive control of the DC-link voltage by the OVPS has a direct effect on the active 
power of the wind turbine. The reactive power dissipation was less for scenario 3 
with the help of the OVPS, as shown in Figure 4.11. In Figure 4.12, the rotor speed 
of the PMSG wind turbine was further improved, considering the OVPS for 
scenario 3. An improved performance of the variables of the PMSG wind turbine 
during transient state, in scenarios 1 and 2, respectively, was achieved using the 
OVPS for all the scenarios compared to the case without OVPS in Section 4.5.1
simulation results of this chapter, however, the OVPS has little or no effect on sce￾nario 3, in the transient performance of the PMSG wind turbine. Thus, a cheaper and 
cost-effective way for the enhancement of the PMSG wind turbine is scenario 3, 
without the circuitry of DC-chopper braking resistor.
4.6 ANALYSIS OF THE DFIG WIND TURBINE CONSIDERING THE 
POWER CONVERTERS EXCITATION PARAMETERS
In order to compare the performance of the effects of the power converters on the 
transient stability of the PMSG wind turbine, a further analysis was carried out in 
this section to investigate the effects of the power converter on the DFIG wind tur￾bine. The same condition of operation was considered as above for the PMSG wind 
turbine. The simulation results for some of the key variables of the DFIG are shown 
in Figures 4.13–4.17, as presented in Chapter 3 of this book.
Figure 4.13 shows that for scenario 1 the DFIG terminal voltage experienced 
overshoot, while for scenario 2, the terminal voltage was not recovered on time. The 
effective performance of the DFIG wind turbine terminal voltage was observed in 
scenario 2. When compared to the PMSG wind turbine, scenario 3 was better than the 
other two scenarios. The reactive power and active power responses in Figures 4.14
and 4.15 show that the DFIG was effectively stable for scenario 2, compared to the 
other scenarios; however, scenario 3 gave the effective performance of the PMSG 
wind turbine. Though scenario 1 gave a better response for the DFIG in Figures 4.16

ground-bolted fault was considered in this study during transient condition, in order 
to test the robustness and rigidity of the controllers of the wind generator. Various 
scenarios were considered, where the turn-on resistance of the IGBTs varied, while 
keeping the turn-off resistance, forward break over voltage and reverse withstand 
voltage constant. This chapter also considered the performance of the wind generator 
with and without the use of DC-chopper overvoltage protection scheme, connected to 
the grid side converter of the wind generator. The presented results show that a high 
turn-on resistance of the IGBTs of the PMSG power converters could help improve 
the performance of the variables of the wind generator during transient state, even 
without considering overvoltage protection scheme. This is because an increase in 
the turn-on resistance would limit the excess circulating current that normally occurs 
during transient state of the wind turbine. More so, the performance of the PMSG 
wind turbine seems to be better with a slightly higher turn-on resistance compared 
to the turn-on resistance value for the DFIG wind turbine, based on the presented 
results. This could be as a result of the full-back-back power converter rating for the 
PMSG wind turbine, as compared to only 20–30% power converter rating for the 
DFIG wind turbine. As part of future scope, an optimization approach using Dragon 
Fly Algorithm, is the next phase of this work, for optimal performance of the wind 
generator.

DFIG and PMSG 
Machine Parameters 5
5.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Variable Speed Wind Turbines (VSWTs) are the new norms for the installation of 
wind farms. These classes of wind turbines have high efficiency in capturing energy, 
with effective voltage control [1]. The Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) and 
Permanent Magnetic Synchronous Generator (PMSG) with back-to-back power con￾verter type technologies have become the two wind generator alternatives, commonly 
employed as VSWTs. The former has a gearbox, and only 20–30% of the generator 
rating is required for its operating speed range of 0.7–1.3 per unit (p.u). The latter’s 
drawback is high cost due to its full-rated power converters.
In the DFIG wind turbine structure, the back-to-back power converter is in 
between the rotor or machine side and the stator or grid side. Based on the available 
wind speeds, this type of wind turbine can operate at a wide range, for better wind 
energy capture [2, 3]. In the DFIG wind turbine, rebuilding of the terminal voltage 
after grid disturbance is much easier due to the pitch and dynamic slip control strat￾egy [4, 5]. More so, the control of active and reactive power through decoupling 
principles is much easier in this class of wind turbine. The power converters of the 
DFIG wind turbine go into standby mode at lower voltages [6–9]; however, during 
grid fault, above the threshold voltages, there is fast synchronization of this type of 
wind generator to the power grid.
On the other hand, the alternative to the DFIG wind turbine in wind energy con￾version is the PMSG wind turbine technology. The PMSG wind turbine has a full￾rated back-to-back power converter tied to the power grid. Consequently, there is 
maximum flexibility in this type of wind generator, compared to the DFIG topology 
[10, 11]. Thus, real and reactive power control are more effective when using the 
PMSG wind turbine. However, high initial cost is the major shortcoming of this class 
of wind turbine system [12].
Based on the literature, there are many Fault Ride Through (FRT) control strate￾gies in the enhancement of DFIG and PMSG wind turbines. Fault current limiters 
[13–15], crowbar switch and DC chopper circuitry [16, 17] and sliding mode con￾trols [18, 19] are some of the FRT schemes already reported in the literature for the 
improvement of the transient stability of either or both wind turbines. The assess￾ment of DFIG using various control methods was carried out in [20–22], with 
emphasis on the use of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) pitch angle con￾troller, considering different algorithms in [23], while peak current limitation and 
MPPT were employed in [24, 25], respectively. In [26], a series fault current limiter 
was employed with metal oxide varistor, to improve the Low Voltage Ride Through 68 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
(LVRT) of DFIG-based wind farms. The application of multi-step bridge-type fault 
current limiter for the PMSG wind turbine was reported in [27], for the improved 
performance of the wind turbine FRT performance. A neuro fuzzy logic controlled 
parallel resonance type fault current limiter scheme was employed in [28], to 
enhance the FRT capability of a wind farm composed of DFIG wind turbines, while 
an entire power systems using fuzzy logic controlled capacitive-bridge-type fault 
current limiter scheme was investigated in [29]. A further approach of using dynamic 
multi-cell fault current limiter was reported in [30], to improve the FRT perfor￾mance of wind farms based on DFIG control, while a sliding mode controller based 
on bridge-type fault current limiter was used for the DFIG FRT improved perfor￾mance in [31].
Machine parameters help in understanding the performance of wind generators. 
These parameters are additional quantities that influence the behavior of the wind 
turbines. However, compared to input variables, the machine parameters are held 
constant or changes slowly in the operation of the wind turbines [32]. Machine 
parameters present some unique functions that should be observed in order to 
improve the maximum power generation output and efficiency of the wind turbines 
[33]. In [34], the evaluation of the mechanical parameters affecting wind turbine 
power generation was carried out, however, the parameters investigated were limited 
to the swept area, air density, wind speed and power coefficient of the wind turbine. 
In [35], wind turbine parameters were estimated and these effects were used to quan￾tify their dynamic behavior. The study was limited to the estimation of certain param￾eters, without extensive study of their effects during transient conditions. In [36], an 
optimized parameter design for the blades of wind turbine considering Schmitz theo￾ries and aerodynamics forces was reported.
In light of the above, this chapter presents the effects of the electrical parameters 
of wind turbines during grid fault. There are limited reports on the effects of electri￾cal parameters considering the DFIG and PMSG VSWTs in the literature. Therefore, 
this chapter tends to bridge this research gap. The DFIG and PMSG wind turbine 
characteristics, modeling and control strategies were presented already in Chapter 1
of this book. The extensive investigation of the effects of the various parameters were 
considered, by varying some machine parameters while keeping the other machine 
parameters constant. In the DFIG analysis, nine scenarios were considered, while in 
the PMSG analysis, ten scenarios were considered. The machine parameters consid￾ered for the DFIG wind turbine are magnetizing inductance, stator leakage induc￾tance, wound rotor leakage inductance, stator resistance, wound rotor resistance and 
the angular moment of inertia. The machine parameters considered for the PMSG 
wind turbine are Stator winding resistance, Stator leakage reactance, D: Unsaturated 
reactance, Q: Unsaturated reactance, D: Damper winding resistance, D: Damper 
winding reactance, Q: Damper winding reactance, Q: Damper winding resistance 
and magnetic strength. The same wind turbine capacity and the same fault condition 
of operation were considered for both wind turbine technologies, and the turbines 
were operated at their rated speed based on their MPPT wind turbine characteristics. 
The simulation analysis was carried out using Power System Computer Aided Design 
and Electromagnetic Transient Including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC) [37].DFIG and PMSG Machine Parameters 69
5.2 TURBINE CHARACTERISTICS AND MODEL OF DFIG WIND 
TURBINE
The DFIG wind turbine characteristics already exist in Chapter 1 of this book. In 
Figure 5.1, the total power is ( ) P P T s   Pg , and it is delivered based on the available 
wind speed through the rotor and stator circuits of the wind turbine to the PCC, for 
r s   (rotor speed greater than synchronous speed). And only active power Ps is 
delivered to the PCC through the stator circuitry (r s   ), while the absorption of 
the active power Pr from the PCC is done via the power converter [38]. In the d-q ori￾entation stator frame synchronous axis, the application of vector control would lead 
to the wind generator’s model on the 5th-order d-q representation [39]. Therefore, 
the stator, rotor and the d-q components considering Figure 5.1 equivalent circuit for 
the DFIG wind turbine are:

Converter (GSC) of the wind generator in Figure 5.3, utilizes the ac grid reference 
frame to regulate the DC-link voltage and flow of reactive power exchange (absorp￾tion and dissipation) in the PCC according to the power flow direction of the rotor 
circuit of the wind turbine. The dq-to-abc and abc-to-dq voltage angles transforma￾tion based on the ac voltage synchronization is achieved with the help of Phase Lock 
Loop (PLL) control strategy.
5.3 TURBINE CHARACTERISTICS AND MODEL OF PMSG WIND 
TURBINE
The PMSG wind turbine characteristics already exist in Chapter 1 of this book. 
Figure 5.4 shows the controller of the Machine Side Converter (MSC) and the GSC 
of the PMSG wind turbine. The MSC regulates both active and reactive power vari￾ables of the wind generator. The angle position rotor (θr
), helps in achieving the abc 
to dq transformation by the rotor speed of wind generator. The d-axis current (Isd) 
controls and the active power (Ps) of the wind generator, while the q-axis currents 
(Isq) regulates the reactive power (Qs) of the wind generator, respectively. The MPPT 
technique for the characteristic is employed in the reference active power (Pref). 
Usually, the reference reactive power (Qs
∗ ) is fixed at 0, to obtain effective operation 
of power factor 1. Three-phase reference voltages (Vsa
∗ , Vsb
∗ , Vsc
∗ ) are generated for 
the PWM switching, through the outputs of the current controller, based on the volt￾age references Vsd
∗ and Vsq
∗ . The GSC control of the wind generator is also shown in 
Figure 5.4 and is regulated considering the d-q rotating reference frame, based on the 
voltage of the grid as the same as the speed of rotation. The Park transformation is 
used in converting (Iga, Igb, Igc) and (Vga, Vgb, Vgc) three-phase voltage and current of 
the grid into their rotating reference d-q frame. The extraction of the phase angle (θg) 
of the grid side is done by considering the PLL [40].

5.4 EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
5.4.1 DFIG Wind Turbine Machine Parameters’ Evaluation
The simulation was carried out considering the nine scenarios summarized in Table 
5.1 [41], for the DFIG machine parameters in per unit values. The fault type is a 
severe three-phase of 100 ms happening at 0.1 s, with the circuit breakers operation 
sequence opening and reclosing at 0.2 s and 1.0 s, respectively, on the faulted line 
at the terminals of the DFIG wind turbine. The system performance was evaluated 
using PSCAD/EMTDC environment. Some of the simulation results for the cases 
considered are shown in Figures 5.5–5.14, based on the design machine parameters 
obtained from the manufacturers of the wind turbine.
In the first part of the analysis, cases 1–3 were considered. Case 1 machine param￾eters values were the original values used by the DFIG wind generator. The machine 
FIGURE 5.4 Control strategy of the PMSG wind turbine.DFIG and PMSG Machine Parameters 73
parameters were varied for cases 2 and 3, considering a uniform increment for all the 
parameters. In Figure 5.5, when the machine parameters were too high or too low, the 
DC-link voltage of the DFIG wind turbine response was not improved, compared to 
case 2. In cases 1 and 3, the DC-link voltage variable had more voltage dip with less 
recovery time. Because the DC-link voltage is related to the response of the active 
power of the wind generator, the same pattern of response could be observed in

terminal voltage response was observed in Figure 5.8. However, in case 3, there was 
more overshoot of the terminal voltage variable compared to case 2. Figure 5.9 shows

that lower machine parameters of the DFIG wind generator would result in less oscil￾lation of the rotor speed variable during transient state; however, it could be trade-off 
compared to the improved performance obtained for the other variables of the wind 
generator.

A further analysis was carried out considering the best values for case 2, where 
improved performance of the DFIG wind turbine variables were obtained during tran￾sient state. The machine parameters were varied and kept constant for cases 4–9 in 
Table 5.1, in order to understand the behavior of the DFIG variables during grid fault. 
Some of the simulation results for this analysis are given in Figures 5.10–5.14.
In case 4, the stator resistance of the DFIG wind turbine was varied, while keeping 
the other machine parameters constant based on the best-obtained values in case 2. In 
case 5, the wound rotor resistance was varied, while in case 6, the angular moment of 
inertia was varied. In cases 7 and 8, the magnetizing inductance and the stator leak￾age inductance were varied, respectively. In case 9, the wound rotor leakage induc￾tance was varied. It could be observed that, varying the stator resistance has a huge 
effect on the DC-link voltage and active power of the DFIG in Figures 5.10 and 5.11. 
Also, cases 5 and 6 have significance effect of the DC-link voltage of the wind gen￾erator. However, cases 7–9 have no effect on the performance of the DFIG DC-link

voltage during transient state. In Figure 5.12, there is much effect on the reactive 
power of the DFIG wind turbine, considering cases 4 and 6. However, more reactive 
power was dissipated for case 5, while cases 7–9 have no significant effect on the 
reactive power of the wind turbine. Cases 4 and 6 have more effect on the terminal 
voltage of the DFIG wind turbine, while cases 5–9 have no significant effect on the 
terminal voltage variable of the wind turbine. Case 5 gave the best performance of 
the rotor speed of the DFIG wind turbine, compared to the other cases. It can be seen 
from the above results that the variation of the stator resistance in case 4 has much 
influence on the transient stability of the DFIG during grid fault.
5.4.2 PMSG Wind Turbine Machine Parameters’ Evaluation
Simulation was carried out considering the ten scenarios summarized in Table 5.2, 
for the PMSG machine parameters in per unit values. The same fault conditions and 
scenarios used for the DFIG wind turbine in Section 5.4.1, of the simulation results 
in this chapter, were considered for the PMSG wind turbine analysis in this section. 
The fault type is a severe three-phase of 100 ms happening at 10.1 s, with the circuit 
breakers operation sequence opening and reclosing at 10.2 s and 11.0 s, respectively, 
on the faulted line at the terminals of the PMSG wind turbine. In the first part of the 
analysis, cases 1–3, were considered. Case 1 machine parameters values were the 
original values used by the PMSG wind generator. The machine parameters were 
varied for cases 2 and 3, considering a uniform increment for all the parameters. 
Some of the simulation results are shown in Figures 5.15–5.24, based on the design 
machine parameters obtained from the manufacturers of the wind turbine.
In Figures 5.15 and 5.16, case 3 gave the best performance of the DC-link and 
active power of the PMSG wind turbine during transient, with faster recovery, short 
settling time and less oscillations. The same behavior could be observed for the reac￾tive power of the GSC, terminal voltage and rotor speed of the PMSG wind turbine 
in Figures 5.17–5.19, respectively. From the results, a too low value of the machine 
parameters of the PMSG wind turbine led to poor performance, compared to the use 
of higher values of the PMSG machine parameters. Thus, the best values of case 3 
were used for further analysis of the PMSG wind turbine machine parameters in 
cases 4–10 by varying the parameters. In case 4, the Q: Damper winding reactance 
was varied and other machine parameters were kept constant, while in case 5, the D: 
Damper winding reactance was varied. In case 6, the D: Damper winding resistance 
was varied, while in case 7, Q: Unsaturated reactance was varied. The D: Unsaturated 
reactance was varied in case 8, while in case 9, the stator leakage reactance was var￾ied. Case 10 considered the variation of the stator winding resistance machine param￾eters of the PMSG wind turbine. A further analysis of the effect of the machine 
parameters was considered by varying these parameters for cases 4–10 as summa￾rized in Table 5.2. Some of the simulation results are shown in Figures 5.20–5.24.
Cases 8 and 10 have huge influence on the DC-link voltage and active power of 
the PMSG wind turbine as shown in Figures 5.20 and 5.21, while cases 4–7 and 9 
have little or no influence on the PMSG variables. In Figure 5.22, the reactive power 
variable of the PMSG is much affected in case 10, compared to the other cases, while 
in Figure 5.23, cases 5 and 10 have a little influence on the terminal voltage variable 78 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines TABLE 5.2 PMSG Machine Parameters PMSG wind turbine (5 MVA) Stator winding resistance (pu) Stator leakage reactance (pu) D: Unsaturated reactance (pu) Q: Unsaturated reactance (pu) D: Damper winding resistance (pu) D: Damper winding reactance (pu) Q: Damper winding reactance (pu) Q: Damper winding resistance (pu) Magnetic strength (pu) Case 1 0.01 0.064 1.00 0.70 0.055 1.00 0.183 1.175 1.4 Case 2 0.05 0.068 1.04 0.74 0.059 1.04 0.187 1.179 1.44 Case 3 0.09 0.072 1.08 0.78 0.063 1.08 0.191 1.183 1.48 Case 4 0.09 0.072 1.08 0.78 0.063 1.08 0.183 1.175 1.48 Case 5 0.09 0.072 1.08 0.78 0.063 1.00 0.191 1.183 1.48 Case 6 0.09 0.072 1.08 0.78 0.055 1.08 0.191 1.183 1.48 Case 7 0.09 0.072 1.08 0.70 0.063 1.08 0.191 1.183 1.48 Case 8 0.09 0.072 1.00 0.78 0.063 1.08 0.191 1.183 1.48 Case 9 0.09 0.064 1.08 0.78 0.063 1.08 0.191 1.183 1.48 Case 10 0.01 0.072 1.08 0.78 0.063 1.08 0.191 1.183 1.48DFIG and PMSG Machine Parameters 79
of the PMSG, compared to the other cases with no significant effect. Figure 5.24
shows that case 10 has huge influence on the rotor speed of the PMSG wind turbine, 
by increasing its value compared to case 5, with less effect and the other cases with 
insignificant effect on the variable of the PMSG. From the results, it could be 
observed that variation in the stator winding resistance of the PMSG wind turbine 
machine parameter in case 10 has great significance in its performance during grid 
fault.

5.5 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
The performance of two VSWTs, DFIG and (PMSG) machine parameters, were 
investigated during severe grid fault, considering their machine parameters. Using 
too low or too high machine parameter values, affect the performance of the DFIG 
wind turbine during transient state, with reference to the commercial obtained values 
used for both wind turbines (case 1) in this study, from Hitachi Laboratory, Hokkaido, 
Japan. Moderate values of machine parameters of the DFIG wind turbine are better 
for improved performance during grid fault. Also, the stator resistance parameter has 
much influence on the variables of the DFIG wind turbines, during transient state. 
Too low machine parameters affect the PMSG wind turbines during transient state. 
The stator winding resistance of the PMSG affects greatly the performance of the 
PMSG variables during transient state.
Therefore, for both wind turbine technologies, the stator winding resistance 
machine parameter has a significant effect on the wind turbine, compared to the other 
parameters. Consequently, a careful selection of the stator winding resistance based 
on the design of the wind turbine could help improve the FRT challenges posed by 
these wind turbines during transient state. This may be a cost-effective way without 
considering external circuitry when compared to most existing FRT solutions for

PMSG in Different 
Grid Strengths 6
6.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
With the recent proliferation and penetration of wind farms into existing power grids, 
it is of paramount importance to conduct numerous studies to counter grid distur￾bances based on operational grid codes. Lately, due to computer and power elec￾tronics technology, soft computing schemes are been applied in wind turbines. The 
four computing algorithms commonly used are the predictive technique, fuzzy logic 
controllers, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm [1]. The fuzzy logic con￾troller was employed in [2], with some merits over traditional controllers. However, 
the sensitivity level to variations in parameters, architecture and operation of the 
system is low. Some works in the literature combined the traditional Proportional 
Integral Derivative (PID) controllers with fuzzy logic [3–5] for better performance. 
Youjie et al. [1] used the linear observer extended state system to further enhance the 
PMSG wind turbine-based performance, considering fuzzy controller, while in [6], 
control based on fuzzy employing adaptive strategy was used for the PMSG.
In weak grids, the challenges of network stability were a result of wind energy 
penetration based on the literature [7–9]. The Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) based on 
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is employed widely in interfacing sources with 
regard to renewable energy and the grid [10, 11]. The utilization of these inverters 
would cause stability issues in the power grid. The studies carried out in the literature 
show that VSI control could affect the stability of power grids. In addition, the stabil￾ity of grid-connected VSI can be affected by a weak grid. A grid that has low Short 
Circuit Ratio (SCR) is said to be weak. In other words, a grid is said to be weak if it 
has impedance that is high and low inertia constant. In [12], the controllers of wind 
turbines were enhanced due to variations in weak grids. Muljadi et al. [13] investi￾gated the control structure of a PMSG wind turbine in a weak grid, where the control 
of the DC-link was done by the Machine Side Converter (MSC).
This chapter targets the improved performance of PMSG-based wind generators 
in relation to grid codes, considering a hybrid scheme of a Series Dynamic Braking 
Resistor (SDBR) and line parameters of a weak grid. The effects of the placement of 
the SDBR with respect to the architecture of the PMSG wind generator machine and 
network side converters were investigated. The voltage of the grid terminal was used 
as the switching signal during transient condition, to control the SDBR. Furthermore, 
this chapter proposes a solution to some of the challenges in weak grids, by employ￾ing the proposed best-sized SDBR for the PMSG grid side, to improve its perfor￾mance during transient state. The mathematical dynamics of the SDBR connection at 
the MSC of the PMSG wind turbine were analyzed. The mathematical model of the 
grid converter side of the PMSG wind turbine was also analyzed, considering the 88 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
impact of the SDBR insertion during transient state. The best-sized SDBR was used 
in the evaluation of the PMSG wind turbine at different network strengths, consider￾ing scenarios that characterized the grid, based on reactive power and ohmic values 
X R/  ratio of the grid impedance (Z). The robustness of the PMSG wind turbine 
controllers was tested using both severe fault conditions of three-phase-to-ground 
and asymmetric faults.
6.2 MODELING OF THE PMSG WIND TURBINE
The modeling of the PMSG wind turbine can be referred to in Chapter 1 of this book.
6.3 THE MODEL SYSTEM AND CONTROL STRATEGY OF THE PMSG
The model system of study for this work is shown in Figure 6.1, where the full back￾to-back power converters, transmission line and a step-up transformer are linking 
the PMSG wind turbine to an infinite bus, with a terminal voltage of 1.0 pu. The 
parameters of the model system are given in Table 6.1 [14]. The base system is 5.0

MVA, with a short circuit MVA of 16.67. A severe case three-phase-to-ground fault 
is considered to occur on the double circuit, as shown in the model system for the 
system evaluation performance. An SDBR is connected to either the MSC or the 
GSC of the PMSG wind turbine, as shown in the model system. Connecting the 
SDBR to the wind generator would improve its transient performance. Investigation 
on the optimal placement of the SDBR position in either the MSC or the GSC was 
carried out in subsequent sections of this chapter. The control scheme for the PMSG 
is already described in Chapters 4 and 5 of this book.
6.4 MATHEMATICAL DYNAMICS OF CONNECTING THE SDBR IN 
THE PMSG WIND TURBINE
The SDBR dynamics in the PMSG-based wind turbine are given in Figure 6.2(a). The 
distinctive merit of the SDBR topology lies in its operation principle, which is based 
on current and not voltage magnitude [15, 16]. During normal operation of the wind 
generator, the resistor is bypassed, because the SDBR switch is on. However, during 
FIGURE 6.2 Dynamics of PMSG and SDBR.90 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
fault conditions, the switch is off because of the series connection of the resistor. The 
switching signal used in switching the SDBR in this work is the terminal grid volt￾age, as given in Figure 6.1. Based on this configuration, the high rotor inrush current 
will be reduced and during transient conditions, the excessive wind turbine active 
power expected will be dissipated by the SDBR system [17, 18]. Consequently, there 
will be an effective balance between the MSC and GSC power converters. Besides, 
the proposed SDBR incorporation in the PMSG would limit the stator current and 
reduce the DC-link current capacitor charging. These activities would help in the 
mechanical system augmentation during transient states of the wind generator.
The main merits of the voltage source converter topology are high-quality DC￾link voltage, bidirectional power flow capability, unity power factor and low AC-line 
current distortions. Since the PMSG-based wind turbine is decoupled fully from the 
network due to the back-to-back power converter, the SDBR can be related to the 
grid-tied inverter dynamics, as shown in Figure 6.2(b). From Figure 6.2(b), the 
PMSG-based wind turbine GSC is connected to the R and L parameters of the grid, 
with AC currents i a = , , b c. Cabc represents the three states of switching for the insu￾lated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). The Cabc converter functions can be substi￾tuted by βabc signals of modulation during high PWM switching frequency. Based on 
Park’s transformation, the PMSG grid-connected voltage source converter could be 
modeled in a rotating frame. The mathematical model for the balanced three-phase 
voltage source converter in Figure 6.2(b) is given as [19]:

and q axes components, while r is the modulation signal vector norm, Udc ,is the DC￾link voltage, RSDBR, is the effective SDBR resistance and ω is the angular frequency. 
Considering three-phase transformation based on Park’s principle and the phase-A 
grid voltage is in alignment with the dq reference synchronous frame, the source 
voltage dq components are given as:
e E d m = (6.5)

powers are computed by

To achieve power factor in unity mode of operation, iq r _ ef can be set to 0. Therefore, 
for the current regulation to be idea, i i q qref = = 0. With iq = 0 and eq = 0, the mathe￾matical model of the voltage source converter under unity power factor can be 
expressed with the following set of equations:

Equation (6.10) implies in order to ensure operation of unity power factor of the 
voltage source converter, the component of βq should proportionally vary with iq cur￾rent. From Equations (6.9) and (6.11), the capacity charge is manipulated by βd, via 
the id current of the input.
The insertion of the SDBR resistance during transient state in the PMSG converter 
would affect the maximal power flow and the DC output voltage. During normal 
condition, the derivative operator relating all terms in Equations (6.9)–(6.11), would 
be zero. Thus, the new set of equations would be:

Based on Equation (6.24), the maximum power transfer of the GSC of the PMSG 
during transient state would be reduced by the insertion of SDBR in the GSC. 
Therefore, the total current reduces its value, thus, mitigating the oscillations that 
normally occur during transient conditions.
6.5 DYNAMICS OF WEAK GRIDS AND VOLTAGE SOURCE 
INVERTERS
The control of frequency converters could be very challenging when considering the 
wind generators’ penetration because of the grid parameters uncertainty. The stabil￾ity of the grid would be affected as the number of inverters increases. In weak grids, 
voltage fluctuations and inverter instability are bound to occur [20, 21]. With the con￾nection of an active load like the PMSG with rated power SPMSG into the network, the 
SCR could be expressed in terms of Short Circuit Capacity (SCC) as:
Short circuit ratio

. (6.25)
where the SCC is the amount of flowing power at the point of a short circuit, UG is 
the grid voltage and Zweak is the impedance of the weak grid. As the standard, with 
SCR lower than factor of 10, the grid is said to be weak [12]. The grid could be 
characterized also by considering reactive power and ohmic values of its impedance 
(Z). This is known as the X R/ ratio or (xrr). Equation (6.26) shows the relationship 
between Z , xrr, the inductive X and ohmic amount R for a typical grid system. 
Usually, in weak grids, xrr is low, about 1 2/ , therefore, these types of grids have 
ohmic features.

From Equation (6.28), there are two UPCC solutions. The first solution describes 
the stable or possible solution, while the second describes the impossible or unstable 
operation of the grid. In the first solution, UPCC is the voltage with a value of 1.0 pu, 
with a well-defined frequency and amplitude. However, this is not the case for the 
second solution. When the PMSG wind generator injects its full power SPMSG = 1 0. pu
into the weak grid, UPCC voltage would change for different P and Q combinations. 
Because the PMSG wind generator will always inject active power, P will be positive 
always, while the inductive or capacitive elements give the reactive power. In light of 
the above, for a very weak grid, a stable operation cannot be achieved, without exter￾nal compensation or oversized GSC. Also, if there is a possibility of power injection 
into the grid, there will always be a PQ combination, in order to achieve fixed voltage 
at the PCC.
This chapter uses SDBR in the PMSG wind turbine GSC to overcome this issue. 
Based on Equations (6.1)–(6.24), the insertion of the SDBR in the GSC of the PMSG 
would enhance its responses as would be demonstrated in Section 6.6.2 in the evalu￾ation of the system performance.
6.6 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
6.6.1 The Placement and Effective Sizing of the SDBR in PMSG-Based
Wind Turbine
The system performance was evaluated using PSCAD/EMTDC [23] environment, 
with the considered model system of Figure 6.1. The fault type is a severe three-phase 
FIGURE. 6.3 Circuit of a weak grid model.PMSG in Different Grid Strengths 95
of 100 ms happening at 10.1 s, with the circuit breaker’s operation sequence open￾ing and reclosing at 10.2 s and 11 s, respectively, on the faulted line. The first part of 
the evaluation of the system performance was carried out considering the position of 
the SDBR at the MSC and the GSC, respectively. A scenario where SDBR was not 
placed at the PMSG wind turbine was also investigated. The wind speed used for the 
PMSG wind generator during operation was its rated value. Figures 6.4–6.8 show 
the performances of the various variables of the wind turbine. From the responses of 
these figures, connecting the SDBR to the MSC of the wind generator has no major 
effect on the PMSG during transient state. This is because the PMSG-based wind tur￾bine is decoupled fully from the network using a back-to-back power converter. The 
undershoot, overshoot and settling time of the terminal voltage of the wind turbine 
variables with the SDBR connected to the MSC was more in Figure 6.4, compared 
to other scenarios. However, placing the SDBR on GSC has a great influence on 
the wind generator variables in fault conditions. This is because the expected wind 
generator stator circuitry of the PMSG high voltage is divided by the SDBR since its 
connection is series topology. In Figures 6.4 and 6.5, the undershoot, overshoot and 
time of settling for the terminal voltage and DC-link voltage were much improved 
considering the effectively sized SDBR. Consequently, there is no loss in control of 
the power converters, since no induced overvoltage would be experienced. More so,

The salient aspect of the chapter is the effective sizing investigation for the SDBR 
in the PMSG wind turbine GSC. From Figures 6.4 to 6.8, a too-small or large value 
of SDBR would result in delay in the recovery of the variables of the wind turbine 
after transient conditions. An effective size of SDBR 0.05pu gave improved responses 
of the PMSG variables. Figures 6.4–6.6 show the responses of the wind generator 
terminal voltage, for no scenario, with SDBR at the MSC and with SDBR of various 
values at the GSC of the wind generator. With no SDBR, poor performance of the 
PMSG wind turbine was experienced especially for the terminal voltage, with high 
undershoot, overshoot and more settling time.
Connecting the SDBR at the MSC converter, apparently, did not enhance the vari￾ables of the PMSG as earlier stated. However, connecting the various values of 
SDBR has a great effect on the terminal voltage, DC-link voltage and the PMSG 
active power, respectively. The DC-link voltage was improved, during transient con￾dition in Figure 6.8, thereby enhancing the active power in Figure 6.6 and the rotor 
speed of the PMSG wind turbine in Figure 6.7, with lower values of undershoot, 
overshoot and time of settling of the variables considering the effective-sized SDBR. 
This is because the SDBR control technique in the PMSG can increase its mechani￾cal output, thus, the transient state condition excursion speed would be limited. 
Consequently, the speed performance would have reduced oscillations, as shown in 
Figure 6.7, with lower undershoot, overshoot and faster settling time. Also, because 
the SDBR has the ability to boost the reactive power dissipation of the GSC of the 
wind generator in Figure 6.8, the terminal voltage of the grid would definitely be 
enhanced as a result of the direct relation between reactive power and voltage, as 
presented in Figure 6.4.
A small effective size of SDBR of value 0.05 pu enhanced the performance of the 
PMSG variables, compared to a smaller size of 0.01 pu or a larger size of 0.06 pu. 
The effective SDBR size is further used for the investigation of the effect of weak 
grid line parameters on the response of the PMSG variables considering SDBR at the 
GSC in Section 6.6.2.
6.6.2  Improving the Performance of PMSG Wind Turbine in Weak Grids
Considering the Effective Size of SDBR
The same model system and fault condition were considered in this section, in order 
to effectively judge the performance of the system. Five scenarios with different 
weak grid parameters, as shown in Table 6.2, were carried out. The effective SDBR 
size of 0.05 pu was used in this analysis. Figures 6.9–6.13 show the response of the 
PMSG wind turbine variables. The values of the line parameters are given in Table 
6.1, while their X/R ratios are given in Table 6.2. The line parameters were varied 
for five scenarios, in order to know their effects on the PMSG system. Furthermore, 
the effective-sized SDBR was used to enhance the PMSG wind turbine performance. 
From Table 6.2, scenarios 1 and 2 were designed for very weak grids with and with￾out considering the effective SDBR in the PMSG-based wind turbine. Scenario 2 
is the weakest grid but with SDBR and scenario 1 is the weakest grid but without 
SDBR. From Figure 6.9, scenario 2 gives better results than scenario 1 in the weakest 
grid scenario, thus, it is justifiable to use SDBR as a recommendation for weak grids. 98 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
The undershoot, overshoot and faster time of settling for scenario 2 is better than 
scenario 1 for the terminal voltage variable. A further increase of the X/R ratio for 
scenario 5 makes the grid strong and with the addition of SDBR, better performance 
is obtained with lower overshoot, undershoot and faster settling time. The voltage of 
the DC bus along with the response of the reactive power for the PMSG variables was 
improved in Figures 6.10 and 6.11, respectively, for scenario 5 for the strongest grid 
with SDBR, compared to the weakest grid with or without SDBR. Though few oscil￾lations were observed for these variables in the weakest grid with SDBR, however, 
their overshoot and undershoot were slightly more than the scenario without SDBR.

This is compensated for in the response of the terminal voltage because more reactive 
power was dissipated. Figure 6.12 reflects that improvement could be achieved via 
the use of the SDBR for the rotor speed in the weakest grid and much better perfor￾mance in scenario 5 during transient state.
6.6.3  Analysis of the Proposed Scheme Considering Asymmetrical Faults
6.6.3.1 Double-Line-to-Grid Fault (2 LG Fault)
The chapter also carried out the investigation of double-line-to-ground fault using 
the same model system employed for the three-line-to-ground fault earlier discussed, 
in order to conclude that the proposed SDBR PMSG scheme could perform better 
during transient state. Figure 6.13 (a–f) shows the performance of the PMSG vari￾ables during double-line-to-ground fault. In Figure 6.13 (a–c), the responses of the 
terminal voltage, DC-link voltage and rotor speed of the PMSG were better with 
the SDBR having an effective value of 0.5 pu connected to the GSC of the wind 
generator, instead of the MSC. Furthermore, considering the strength of the grid, the 
responses in Figure 6.13 (d–f) show that the proposed scheme can improve the per￾formance of the PMSG wind turbine in weak grids, when a double-line-to-grid fault 
is applied to the model system.

scheme during transient state. Figure 6.14 (a–f) shows the performance of the PMSG 
variables during line-to-line fault. In Figure 6.14 (a–c), the responses of the terminal

PMSG were better with the SDBR having an effective value of 0.5 pu connected 
to the GSC of the wind generator, instead of the MSC. Furthermore, considering 
the strength of the grid, the responses in Figure 6.15 (d–f) show that the proposed 
scheme can improve the performance of the PMSG wind turbine in weak grids when 
subjected to a single-line-to-ground fault.
6.6.3.4 Comparison of the Various Asymmetric Fault Conditions
A comparative analysis was carried out using the proposed scheme that gave bet￾ter performance (scenario 5) in Section 6.6.2 with the model system in Figure 6.1, 
considering double-line-to-ground, line-to-line and single-line-to-ground asymmet￾ric faults, respectively. As shown in Figure 6.16, the terminal voltage of the PMSG 
experienced more voltage deep for 2LG, compared to the other asymmetric fault sce￾narios. Figure 6.17 shows that the response of the rotor speed of the wind generator 
was more affected considering the oscillations and settling time for 2LG, compared 
to the LL and 1 LG asymmetric fault scenarios, respectively. These results demon￾strate the effectiveness and robustness of the controllers employed for the improved 
performance of the proposed PMSG wind generator scheme considering any fault 
scenario.

6.7 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
As the penetration of a huge amount of wind energy in modern power grids is on the 
rise, failure to provide robust fault ride through solutions would lead to the continu￾ous shutdown of power systems made of multi-machine and wind farms. One of the 
targets of this chapter was to enhance the performance of the PMSG wind turbine 
considering an SDBR, fault current limiter. The SDBR position was investigated by 
connecting it at the machine and grid side converters of the wind generator. From 
the study in this chapter, it was found out that placing SDBR at the PMSG grid side 
would enhance its performance, compared to connecting it at the machine side. A 
further investigation of the size of the SDBR was done in this chapter. When a small￾or large-sized SDBR was used in the network side of the PMSG, the variables of 
the wind generator were delayed in recovery and settling back to their steady states 
during transient conditions, however, an effectively sized SDBR value gave a better 
performance. More so, the performance of the wind turbine using the effectively 
sized SDBR was investigated, considering different scenarios of the network line 
parameters. It was observed that since weak grids are characterized by their X/R 
ratio, the use of the SDBR scheme for the PMSG wind turbine would improve its 
performance by the selection of the appropriate resistive and reactance parameters 
of the grid. Thus, it is justifiable to use SDBR as a recommendation for weak grids 
transient performance enhancement.

DFIG and PMSG in 
Weak and Strong Grids 7
7.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Power grids could be classified based on their Short Circuit Ratio (SCR). A power 
grid that has low SCR is said to be weak, while a power grid with high SCR is said 
to be strong. In other words, a power grid is said to be weak if it has an impedance 
that is high and inertia low constant, while a power grid is said to be strong if it has 
an impedance that is low and inertia high constant. In the literature, several works 
on weak grids and the challenges they pose on network stability considering wind 
energy penetration has been reported [1–3]. There is a great influence of interfacing a 
Voltage Source Converter (VSC) with Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) on the power 
grid stability. Garcia-Garcia et al. [4] showed that the controllers of wind turbines 
could be improved in weak grids during voltage variations.
In this chapter, a comparative analysis regarding stability issues faced by DFIG 
and PMSG wind turbines is investigated in various grid strengths. The modeling and 
wind turbine characteristics of both wind generators were analyzed along with their 
control strategies. Both wind turbines were subjected to weak, normal and strong 
grids with a severe bolted three-line-to-ground fault, without any protection or 
enhancement scheme, in order to test the robustness of the controllers employed. The 
mathematical dynamics of the implementation of the series dynamics braking resis￾tor (SDBR) as a limiter of the fault current at the stator of both wind turbines for 
effective comparison study was also presented. The effective SDBR size was used for 
both wind turbine technologies, considering the same switching signal of the grid 
voltage during transient state. Furthermore, an overvoltage protection system was 
considered for both wind turbines based on the connection of a DC chopper circuitry 
at the power converter of the wind turbines. A combination of the SDBR and over￾voltage protection scheme of the DC chopper was employed for both wind turbines 
operating at weak grids, which is characterized based on reactive power and ohmic 
values X R/  ratio of the grid impedance (Z). The evaluation of both wind turbines 
was done for weak, normal and strong grids, considering the same machine ratings 
of the wind turbines. Because of the critical situations of the wind turbines during 
faulty conditions in the weak grids, an analysis was done considering the use of 
effective Series Dynamic Braking Resistor (SDBR) for both wind turbines. The grid 
voltage variable was employed as the signal for switching the SDBR in both wind 
turbines during transient state. Also, an overvoltage protection system was consid￾ered for both wind turbines using the DC chopper in the DC-link excitation circuitry 
of both wind turbines. Furthermore, a combination of the SDBR and DC chopper 
was employed in both wind turbines at weak grid conditions in order to improve the 
performance of the variable speed wind turbines. There is a limited number of studies 108 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
in the literature that considered the scenarios of weak and strong grids for both wind 
turbines, in conjunction with the SDBR control and overvoltage protection topolo￾gies. Most studies in the literature considered these scenarios on a separate basis for 
the fault ride through enhancement of both wind generators.

The wind turbine characteristics are shown in Figure 7.1. The range of the rotor 
speed for DFIG is between 0.7 p.u and 1.3 p.u and maximum power obtains a turbine 
speed of 0.97 pu. On the other hand, maximum power for PMSG is obtained when 
the turbine speed is 1.0 pu.
7.2.2  DFIG Model and Control
Details of the DFIG model and control can be obtained from Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 5
of this book [6–9]. The Rotor Side Converter (RSC) control of the DFIG in Figure 
7.2 is regulated by the axes q and d currents iqr and idr. This is done by (P Qs s , ), of 
the stator. The MPPT obtains the Ps. In Figure 7.3, the Grid Side Converter (GSC) 
of the wind generator employs reference frame ac grid to control the DC-link volt￾age and flow of reactive power exchange at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) 
based on power flow direction of the rotor circuitry. The dq-to-abc and abc-to-dq DFIG and PMSG in Weak and Strong Grids 109

7.2.3 PMSG Model and Control
The PMSG reference power Pref is limited to wind generator-rated power. The full 
back-to-back power converters of the PMSG turbine [10], tied to the grid, are shown 
in Figure 7.4. For Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) realization [11, 12], the 
speed control is achieved by the Machine Side Converter (MSC). However, the GSC 
takes care of the effective voltage of the DC stabilization and regulation of the power 
factor and power quality.
Details of the PMSG model and control can be obtained in Chapters 1, 4, 5 and 6
of this book [13–16]. Figure 7.5 shows the controller of the MSC of the PMSG, 
which regulates both the output power of the active and reactive variables. The abc￾to-dq-based variables transformation is achieved via angle position rotor (θr
) consid￾ering the rotor speed of the wind generator. The Isd, Isq regulates both (Ps), (Qs) of the 
wind generator, respectively. The MPPT technique is employed in the (Pref). Usually 
(Qs
∗
) is fixed at 0, to obtain effective operation of power factor 1. Three-phase

) are generated for the PWM switching, through the 
outputs of the current controller, based on the voltage references Vsd
∗ and Vsq
∗ . The GSC 
control in Figure 7.6 is regulated considering the d-q rotating reference frame, based 
on the voltage of the grid and the speed of rotation. The Park transformation is used 
in converting (Iga, Igb, Igc) and (Vga, Vgb, Vgc) into their rotating reference d-q frame. 
The extraction of the phase angle (θg) is done by considering the phase lock loop.

7.4 MATHEMATICAL DYNAMICS OF SDBR IN PMSG WIND 
TURBINE
Based on Park’s transformation, the PMSG grid-connected VSC could be modeled in 
rotating frame. A recap of the mathematical model for the balanced three-phase VSC 
in Figure 7.4 as discussed in Chapter 6 is given as [19]:

From Equations (7.14) to (7.17), id , iq represent the dq current input of the recti￾fier’s axes, ed, eq are known as the dq voltage of the grid voltage axes components, ω
is the angular frequency voltage, βd, βq represent the modulating signal of the recti￾fier’s d and q axes components, while RL, is the modulation signal vector norm. 
Considering three-phase transformation based on Park’s principle, and the phase-A 
grid voltage is in alignment with the dq reference synchronous frame, the source 
voltage dq components are given as:
e E d m = (7.18)
eq = 0 (7.19)
From Equation (7.18), Udc , is the phase grid voltage amplitude. Consequently, the

To achieve power factor in unity mode of operation, iq r _ ef can be set to 0. Therefore, 
for the current regulation to be ideal, i i q qref = = 0. With iq = 0 and eq = 0, the mathe￾matical model of the VSC under unity power factor can be expressed with the follow￾ing set of equations:

Equation (7.23) implies in order to ensure operation of unity power factor of the 
VSC, the component of βq should proportionally vary with iq current. From Equations 
(7.22) and (7.24), the capacity charge is manipulated by βd, via the id current of the 
input.
The insertion of the SDBR resistance during transient state in the PMSG converter 
would affect the maximal power flow and the DC output voltage. During normal 114 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines

Therefore, the total current reduces its value, thus, mitigating the oscillations that 
normally occur during transient conditions.

Rigorous simulation studies were conducted to compare the fault ride through fea￾tures in different grid conditions. The ratings of the parameters of both wind tur￾bines are given in Table 7.1. The system performance was evaluated using PSCAD/
EMTDC [20] environment. The fault types are symmetrical three-phase and unsym￾metrical single-line-to-ground of 100 ms happening at 10.1 s, with the circuit break￾ers operation sequence opening and reclosing at 10.2 s and 11 s, respectively, on the 
faulted line at the terminals of both wind turbines. The fault performance with and 
without stability augmentation tools like SDBR and Overvoltage Protection System 
(OVPS) are presented below in detail.
7.5.1  Operation of the DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines at Different
Grid Strengths
The DFIG and PMSG wind turbines were subjected to the weak grid, normal grid 
and strong grid, as shown in cases 1 to 3 in Table 7.2, considering no insertion of 116 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
the SDBR and no OVPS. Some of the simulation results for the cases considered are 
shown in Figures 7.7–7.11.
From Figure 7.7, the overshoot of the DFIG and PMSG DC-link voltage variable 
could lead to the damage of the fragile and vulnerable power converters of the wind 
turbines during transient state. While the PMSG wind turbine experienced more 
overshoot and more settling time, the DFIG wind turbine has more DC-link voltage 
dip, with faster settling time. The overshoot and Dc-link voltage is more for case 1 
(weak grid), compared to the other cases. The responses for the terminal voltage and 
the active power are shown in Figures 7.8 and 7.9, respectively. From Figures 7.9
and 7.10, more oscillations were observed for the active and reactive power variables

with more oscillations and lower settling time during weak grid periods. However, 
the effect of the weak grid on the rotor speed of the DFIG wind turbine is negligible 
compared to the minimal effect observed in the PMSG wind turbine (Figure 7.11) 
during transient state for weak power grids. The effect of the power grid strengths is 
more obvious for the PMSG than the DFIG because the PMSG-based wind turbine 
is decoupled fully from the network due to the back-to-back power converter.

Consequently, the operation of the wind turbine in weak grids of case 1, is a critical 
situation during faulty condition, based on the presented simulation results in Figures 
7.7–7.11. In light of this, the subsequent sections of this chapter would consider the 
improvement of the wind turbine’s fault ride through in weak grids considering the 
employment of SDBR and OVPS schemes.
7.5.2  Improving the Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines in
Weak Grids Considering the Effective Sizing of SDBR
The performances of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines in weak grids were further 
enhanced considering the use of an effective-sized SDBR shown in Table 7.1. The 
SDBR was connected at the stator side of both wind turbines for effective compari￾son during transient state. In this considered case summarized in Table 7.2 (cases 1 
and 4), no overvoltage protection scheme was considered. Some of the simulation 
results for the key variables of the wind turbines are shown in Figures 7.12–7.14. 
The undershoot, overshoot and settling time of the DC-link voltage, terminal volt￾age and active power of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbine variables without the 
SDBR connected at the stator was more, as shown in Figures 7.12–7.14. However, 
placing the SDBR on GSC of both wind turbines has great influence on the wind

generator variables in fault conditions. This is because the expected wind generator 
stator circuitry of the DFIG and PMSG high voltage is divided by the SDBR since 
its connection is series topology. As seen from Figures 7.12–7.14, the undershoot, 
overshoot and time of settling for the wind generator variables were much improved 
considering the effective-sized SDBR. Consequently, there is no loss in control of the 
power converters, since no induced overvoltage would be experienced. More so, dur￾ing operation, the SDBR has the capability to mitigate high current flow significantly,

thus, avoiding dangerous overvoltage and high charging current normally experi￾enced in power converters that are vulnerable and fragile in nature.
7.5.3  Improving the Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines in
Weak Grids Considering Overvoltage Protection System (OVPS)
The performances of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines in weak grids were further 
enhanced considering the use of an effective-sized OVPS shown in Table 7.1. The 
OVPS is a DC chopper connected at the DC-link of both wind turbines for effective 
comparison during transient state. In this considered case summarized in Table 7.2
(cases 1 and 5), no SDBR scheme was considered. The DC-link voltage variable of 
the wind turbines are shown in Figure 7.15. The undershoot, overshoot and settling 
time of the DC-link voltage of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbine variable without 
considering OVPS were more than when OVPS was considered. This would protect 
the power converters of the wind turbines because the wind turbines power convert￾ers would be operating within its permissible limits.
7.5.4  Improving the Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
in Weak Grids Considering SDBR and Overvoltage Protection
System
The performances of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines in weak grids were further 
enhanced considering the combination of an effective-sized SDBR and OVPS shown 
in Table 7.1. In this considered case summarized in Table 7.2 (cases 1 and 6), a com￾bination of SDBR and OVPS schemes would definitely improve the performance of 
the wind generator variables, as shown in the DC-link voltage and terminal voltage 
variables of the wind turbines in Figures 7.16 and 7.17.
The undershoot, overshoot and settling time of the DC-link voltage, terminal volt￾age of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines without considering SDBR and OVPS in 
weak grids were more as shown in Figures 7.16 and 7.17, respectively. However, in 
order to improve the fault ride through of the wind turbines, a combination of the 
SDBR and OVPS would protect the power converters and enhance the variables of

the wind turbines. Thus, this type of hybrid fault ride through technique is recom￾mended for variable speed wind turbines operating at weak power grids.
7.5.5  Improving the Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines in
Weak Grids Considering 75 and 50% of the Effective SDBR and
Overvoltage Protection System
The performances of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines in weak grids were further 
investigated considering the combination of 75 and 50% effective-sized SDBR and 
OVPS shown in Table 7.1. In this considered case summarized in Table 7.2 (cases 
1 and 7), the proposed hybrid scheme is proven to enhance the performance of the 
wind turbines at transient state even with reduced value of 75 and 50% of their effec￾tive values, as shown in Figures 7.18 and 7.19 for 75% reduction and Figures 7.20
and 7.21 for 50% reduction, for the DC-link voltage and the terminal voltage of the 
wind turbines. Thus, it is better to use half of the effective values of the combined 
schemes, than using either SDBR or OVPS.

7.5.6  Investigating the Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
in Weak Grids Considering the Effective SDBR and Overvoltage
Protection System in a Single-Line-to-Ground Fault
The study of the performance of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines in weak grids 
was extended for the single-line-to-ground fault, which is an example of unsym￾metrical fault as shown in Figures 7.22 and 7.23, respectively. The combination of 
an effective-sized SDBR and OVPS shown in Table 7.1, were considered, as summa￾rized in Table 7.2 (cases 1 and 6). From the results in Figures 7.22 and 7.23, a com￾bination of SDBR and OVPS schemes would definitely improve the performance of 
the wind generator variables even during unsymmetrical fault conditions.
For 50% reduction of the effective SDBR and OVPS during a single-line-to￾ground unsymmetrical fault, the response for the DC-link voltage and the terminal 
voltage of the wind turbines are shown in Figures 7.24 and 7.25, respectively. From 
the obtained results, is better to use half of the effective values of the combined 
schemes, than using either SDBR or OVPS, as obtained earlier using a severe three￾phase-to-ground fault.

As seen from the mathematical dynamics of the SDBR in the wind turbines pre￾sented in this chapter, the SDBR is closely related to the stator resistance of the wind 
turbines. Also, the maximum power transfer of the GSC of the wind turbines, during 
transient state would be reduced by the insertion of SDBR in the GSC. Therefore, by 
reducing the percentage of the SDBR or OVPS, the maximum power transfer would 
be slightly increased. This means more rating of the wind generator would be 
required, while keeping the performance satisfactory.
7.6 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
This chapter presented a comparative evaluation of the performance of DFIG and 
PMSG wind turbines with the same machine ratings. The wind turbines were oper￾ated at weak, normal and strong grids to show the influence of the network param￾eters on the wind turbines. Both wind turbines were affected by the various strengths 
of the power grid. However, the influence of the power grid strengths was more 
observed in the PMSG wind turbine compared to the DFIG wind turbine. This is 
because the PMSG wind turbine is decoupled at the grid or network side by its full 
back-to-back power converters. The weak power grids would result in critical situa￾tion of operation during faulty conditions, compared to the normal and strong power 
grids. Consequently, further analysis using the weak power grid was considered in 
this chapter for both wind turbines, considering the use of SDBR and OVPS. The 
hybrid scheme of the SDBR and OVPS in both wind turbines was able to improve the 
performance of the variables of the wind turbine and keep the operation of the power 
converters within their permissible limits. It was observed that, even if a 50% reduc￾tion in SDBR or OVPS, the performance is still satisfactory, as shown in Section 
7.5.5 of this chapter.
Therefore, it is recommended to use the combination of the SDBR and OVPS 
with DFIG or PMSG-based variable speed wind turbines to get superior fault ride 
through performance, especially in weak grid conditions.

DFIG Wind Turbines and 
Supercapacitor Scheme 8
8.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
The energy storage systems (ESS) model is one of the most widely used control strat￾egies in wind energy conversion system. One of the ESS elements is a supercapacitor 
that enables smooth output power, with the ability of mitigating oscillations. Constant 
power control could be provided in DFIG wind turbines by using the supercapacitor 
model. In the literature, a management control unit has been developed to provide 
power tracking in a two-layer control scheme in [1] and constant power control in [2, 
3], considering the supercapacitor model. In [4], a study on the suppression of power 
fluctuation in DFIG based on supercapacitor energy storage was carried out, in order 
to improve its performance. The study elaborated that supercapacitors could be used 
in DFIGs to obtain constant output power as well as to prevent frequency changes of 
switching elements in the converter circuit. The study monitored the maximum power 
point of a DFIG wind turbine, considering the supercapacitors scheme. In another 
study carried out in [5, 6], the responses to the change in wind speed, tower shadow 
and protection units were investigated. The supercapacitor model was selected in 
order to optimize energy production and consumption by adjusting the output power 
in the DFIG. The safe and effective use of the supercapacitors was observed under 
optimal operating conditions in [7, 8], for a battery hybrid energy storage system and 
wind energy integration. In addition to ensuring optimum operating conditions, a 
coordinated control was carried out in the DFIG wind turbine considering the super￾capacitor scheme in two stages for optimal active power control management [9]. 
The supercapacitor was selected in order to provide pitch angle control in the DFIG 
because of its advantages which include high performance, high temperature operat￾ing ability, long service life and convenient use in applications [10].
In this chapter, a new control strategy of a supercapacitor system is examined for 
a DFIG wind turbine during severe grid fault condition. A simple two-machine model 
system consisting of a DFIG connected to a fixed speed squirrel cage induction gen￾erator wind turbine was used in carrying out the transient analysis in this study. The 
supercapacitor system was connected across the terminals of the DC-link voltage of 
the DFIG wind turbine, between the RSC and the GSC. The study considered the 
determination of the effective parameters of the supercapacitor in the DFIG wind 
turbine, by considering different values of resistance, inductance and capacitance of 
the supercapacitor, in various scenarios. Furthermore, two switching strategies of the 
embedded supercapacitor system in the DFIG, the DC-link voltage and the grid volt￾age, were investigated using the various values earlier considered. The obtained 
results were compared with those using parallel capacitor scheme for the DFIG con￾nected to the RSC and GSC of the wind turbine. For effective comparative study, 128 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
between the supercapacitor and parallel capacitor-based solution to buffer the tran￾sient energy of the DFIG, the same capacitance value was employed in the study. The 
proposed supercapacitor scheme for the DFIG wind turbine has the ability to store a 
large amount of electric charge compared to parallel capacitors and all other types of 
conventional capacitors. This is because the charge storage, which is the capacitance 
in conventional capacitors, is directly proportional to the surface area of each elec￾trode or plate and inversely proportional to the distance between them. The topology 
of capacitors and batteries in wind turbines differs in two ways considering the 
amount of charge or energy storage and how quickly the charge or energy is dissi￾pated. The batteries have the ability to store more energy than conventional capaci￾tors, however, the shortcoming of the batteries is that they cannot deliver the stored 
energy very quickly. Though the capacitors deliver the stored energy more quickly, 
however, they lack the ability to store a large amount of energy as the batteries. These 
two shortcomings could be overcome by using the proposed supercapacitors in DFIG 
wind turbines. This is because the supercapacitors have large surface area electrodes 
and very thin dielectric, as separating distance between the electrodes. Thus, com￾pared to the conventional capacitors, the supercapacitors have very small distance 
between the electrodes, making it possible to obtain larger capacitance or energy 
storage that is delivered quickly to help improve the performance of the DFIG wind 
turbine variables during transient state [11].

The connection of the supercapacitor in the DFIG is shown in Figure 8.2, where 
P is the grid side transformer power, Pgrid is the power of the grid, Ps is the stator 
power, Pr
 is the rotor power and Psupercapacitor is the power of the supercapacitor. In the 
DFIG, the supercapacitor is able to adjust the DC bus voltage value in the range of 
0–100%. While certain parts of the power values are met by the grid in the creation 
of the supercapacitor model, the remaining power values are met by the DFIG. The 
amount of energy and capacity expressions stored in the supercapacitor are given in 
Equations (8.13)–(8.15).

8.4 THE MODEL SYSTEM OF STUDY AND PARAMETERS
The model system used for this study is shown in Figure 8.3(a) and the related 
parameters of the wind turbines are given in Table 8.1. The excitation parameters 
of the DFIG are given in Table 8.2, while the parameters of the supercapacitor sys￾tem for the different cases considered are given in Table 8.3. In the model system of 
Figure 8.3(a), the DFIG and Induction Generator (IG) wind turbines were connected 
to an infinite bus bar and subjected to a severe three-phase-to-ground fault. The super￾capacitor was connected to the terminals of the DFIG wind turbine in Figure 8.3, as 
shown in Figure 8.2.
The switching strategy of the supercapacitor is based on the DC-link voltage 
exceeding the set threshold of 110% of its nominal value during transient state or the 
grid voltage dropping below 1.0 pu, as shown in Tables 8.2 and 8.3, respectively. The 
parameter estimation procedure for the supercapacitor is described as follows based 
on Figure 8.3(b). Generally, the models of the parameters usually have differential 
equations, transfer functions or block diagrams, that are updated offline or online. To 
obtain offline mode parameters, the process involves storing the data to use them

much later, while for the online mode, it is based on a parallel experiment [15]. 
However, there exist many procedures to achieve supercapacitor parameters like an 
unscented Kalman filter [16] or the Luenberger-style scheme [17]. In this chapter, the 
supercapacitor parameters were selected based on interactive, simple and offline pro￾cedures [18] in Figure 8.3(b) considering the Simscape model of Figure 8.3(c), 
respectively.
8.5 SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
8.5.1  Evaluation of the Proposed DFIG Supercapacitor Scheme
Rigorous simulation studies were conducted to compare the fault ride through fea￾tures of the DFIG supercapacitor-based system connected to a fixed speed induction 
generator wind turbine shown in Figure 8.3(a) model system. The system perfor￾mance was evaluated using PSCAD/EMTDC [19] environment. The fault type is a 
severe symmetrical three-phase of 100 ms happening at 0.1 s, with the circuit break￾ers operation sequence opening and reclosing at 0.2 s and 1.0 s, respectively, on the 
faulted line at the fault point shown in the model system of Figure 8.3(a). The fault 
performance with different parameters and switching strategies of the stability aug￾mentation tool of the supercapacitor is presented below in detail.

The DFIG wind turbine with supercapacitor scheme was subjected to cases 1–6 in 
Table 8.3, considering the excitation parameters and switching thresholds in Table 
8.2. Some of the simulation results for the cases considered are shown in Figures 
8.4–8.12. In Figures 8.4 and 8.5, the DC-link voltage was not able to recover on time 
after the grid fault using both switching strategies of DC-link and grid voltage for 
cases 1, 4, 2 and 5, respectively. However, for cases 3 and 6, in Figure 8.6, the per￾formance of the DC-link voltage was the same for both switching strategies. Thus, 
the effective parameters of the supercapacitor for better performance of the DFIG 
wind turbine during transient state are 0.3Ω, 3H, 3F, for R, L, C, respectively, in 
Table 8.3. Figures 8.7–8.9 show the terminal voltage for the DFIG and IG wind tur￾bines. From the figures, the parameters of the supercapacitors do not have effects on 
the responses of the terminal voltage of the wind turbines.
In Figure 8.10(a) and (b) the active power was more influenced in case 6, com￾pared to the other cases using the supercapacitor scheme, while in Figure 8.11(a) and 
(b), the reactive power was also more dissipated or enhanced in case 6 compared to 
the other cases. It was also observed from the DFIG rotor speed performance in 
Figure 8.12(a) and (b) that the transient state performance in case 6 gave better 
response. Therefore, the effective parameters for the improved performance of the 
DFIG supercapacitor embedded system are when the resistance, inductance and

capacitance values are not too small. This is because the terminal voltage of the gen￾erator increases, mitigating the depression of the electrical torque and power. The 
supercapacitor will increase the mechanical power extracted from the drive train, 
thus reducing its speed excursion. Also, since mechanical torque is proportional to 
the square of the stator voltage of the DFIG, the effect would enhance the post-fault 
recovery of the DFIG wind turbine.

Figures 8.14 and 8.15 show the comparative analysis of the proposed DFIG super￾capacitor scheme and the conventional DFIG parallel capacitor scheme. In Figures 8.14DFIG Wind Turbines and Supercapacitor Scheme 139
and 8.15, when the parallel capacitor was connected to the GSC of the DFIG power 
converter, better response was observed for the DC-link voltage and rotor speed of the 
wind generator, with fast recovery of the variables after transient state. The connection 
of the parallel converter at the RSC led to delayed recovery of the wind generator 
DC-link voltage and rotor speed variables. However, the proposed supercapacitor 
DFIG-based system for case 6 with optimal parameter ratings gave optimal changes 
than cases 3 and 4 and also the conventional DFIG parallel capacitor scheme.
8.5.3  Evaluation of the Proposed DFIG Supercapacitor System during
Asymmetrical Faults at Super-synchronous and Sub-synchronous
Speeds
A further analysis of the performance of the proposed approach during super￾synchronous as well as sub-synchronous speeds was carried out in this section, as 
this will significantly affect the LVRT capability of the DFIG during asymmetrical 
faults. Figures 8.16 and 8.17 show the responses of the DFIG wind turbine during 
super-synchronous speed, when the wind speed is above the nominal or rated wind 
speed, and the sub-synchronous speed, when the wind speed is below the nominal or 
rated wind speed. In Figures 8.16 and 8.17, the performances of the DFIG DC-link

In this section of this chapter, the performance of the proposed scheme was car￾ried out under zero-voltage condition at the terminal of the DFIG wind turbine, as 
this issue has been demanded by most of the recent grid codes. In Figure 8.22, the 
DC-link voltage of the wind generator reached almost zero value during the tran￾sient state, and it was able to recover. Similarly, the terminal voltage of the DFIG

value during the transient state and was able to regain stability within a short time to 
its steady state.

8.6 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
The use of energy storage elements plays an important role in theoretically resolv￾ing transient problems in grid-connected DFIG-based wind turbines. This chap￾ter investigated the effects of a supercapacitor, as an energy storage system, in 
DFIG transient stability. The supercapacitor was connected at the DC-link voltage, 
between the rotor side converter and grid side converter of the DFIG wind turbine. 
The performance of the supercapacitor was investigated by varying its resistance, 
inductance and capacitance parameters. A simple machine model system of DFIG 
and fixed speed induction generator tied to an infinite bus was used in the study. 
The DC-link voltage and grid voltage were used for the switching of the super￾capacitor. It was observed that when the resistance, capacitance and inductance 
parameters of the supercapacitor were too small, the DC-link voltage and grid volt￾age switching strategies gave poor performances during transient state. However, 
the performance of the supercapacitor system in the DFIG was improved when the 
effective values of the parameters during transient state were used. The proposed 
supercapacitor DFIG scheme was compared to existing solutions in the literature, 
using the parallel capacitor scheme for the DFIG, considering the same capaci￾tance value. The obtained results show that the use of the existing parallel capacitor 
scheme in the DFIG grid side power converter was able to enhance the performance 
of the DC-link voltage and rotor speed of the wind generator, with fast recovery of 
the variables after transient state, compared to when it is at the rotor side converter 
of the DFIG. However, the proposed supercapacitor DFIG-based system with opti￾mal parameter ratings gave optimal changes than the conventional DFIG parallel 
capacitor scheme.

9.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
The use of Fault Current Limiters (FCLs) hardware-based solutions in wind turbines 
has shown good results in fulfilling the Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) require￾ments of grid codes [1]. The technologies of FCLs are basically Superconducting 
Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) type and Non-superconducting Fault Current Limiter 
(NSFCL) type. There is no power loss in SFCLs, with good speed control, however, 
their configurations are complex [2–4]. The technology of the NSFCLs can solve 
the drawbacks of SFCLs and also provide better LVRT capability [5, 6]. The use of 
Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) gave way for the NSFCLs more than 
the others. The Series Dynamic Braking Resistors (SDBRs) [7, 8] and Bridge Fault 
Current Limiters (BFCLs), with resistive, inductive and capacitive elements [9] and 
parallel resonance type FCL (PRFCL) [10] show considerable improvement of the 
performance of variable speed wind turbines.
This chapter investigates the performance of PMSG-based wind turbines, consid￾ering the SDBR and the BFCL topologies during LVRT. The mathematical dynamics 
of the power converter for the Grid Side Converter (GSC) of the PMSG were mod￾eled for the SDBR and the BFCL in the PMSG wind turbine for steady and transient 
states. The robustness of the controllers of the wind generator was tested, using the 
threshold value of the grid voltage as the switching signal during LVRT for a bal￾anced three-phase-to-ground fault in Power System Computer Aided Design and 
Electromagnetic Transient Including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC) environment [11].
9.2 OVERVIEW OF FAULT CURRENT LIMITER TOPOLOGIES
There are several types of FCLs used in the LVRT of wind turbines [12, 13]. These 
FCLs have various benefits and drawbacks, thus, their performance would be differ￾ent based on the requirements [14]. The FCLs control strategies could be broadly 
classified into SFCLs, NSFCLs and Magnetic Fault Current Limiters (MFCLs), as 
shown in Figure 9.1 [15]. Because of their strong ability of mitigating fault currents 
during transient [16] and no power loss being incurred during their operation, FCLs 
are currently in use in variable speed wind farms [17].
The SFCL could work in hybrid with Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage 
(SMES) for effective energy management during and after transient states [18–20]. 
However, the SFCLs have complex structures, not cheap to implement, and liquid 
cryogenic system is required for changing non-superconducting mode to 146 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
superconducting mode. The MFCLs configuration has basically a core that is lami￾nated, with a permanent magnet connecting the poles [21]. The use of permanent 
magnets would help in limiting the high fault currents because of the large square 
hysteresis loop they possess. The main shortcoming of the MFCLs is that it becomes 
weak over time, consequently, reducing its efficiency [22, 23].
The NSFCLs are cheaper compared to the SFCLs considering the same level of 
dynamic stability [24]. The employed NSFCLs [25, 26] have power losses because 
of their static components. However, SFCLs with flux coupling can reduce the power 
loss usually found in FCLs. But the high cost incurred would discourage their imple￾mentation. In this chapter, the PMSG wind turbine would be investigated during 
transient state using the SDBR and the BFCL topologies of the NSFCLs.
9.3 MODELING OF THE PMSG WIND TURBINE WITH BACK-TO￾BACK CONVERTERS
Figure 9.2 shows the complete system for a grid-connected PMSG wind turbine hav￾ing full back-to-back converter. The PMSG wind turbine system shown in Figure 9.2
has no gearbox, thus, there is a direct coupling between the wind turbine and the 
wind generator. The output of the generator is connected to the power grid by a DC￾link power converter, MSC and GSC.
For modeling the system dynamics of the PMSG wind turbine, the following dif￾ferential equations apply. The mechanical power extracted Pwt and the torque Twt

rated power. The maximum power output of 1.0 pu was obtained at 12 m/s and 1.0 pu 
rotational speed.
9.4 THE POWER CONVERTER CONTROL OF THE PMSG WIND 
TURBINE
Figure 9.4 shows the power converter control for the MSC and the GSC of the PMSG 
wind turbine. In normal conditions, the MSC regulates the active power control to 
extract maximum wind power. The MSC of the PMSG wind turbine is shown in 
Figure 9.4, where the rotor speed is regulated based on its reference value obtained 
from the MPPT characteristics in Figure 9.3. In Figure 9.4, the q-axis current i  qsref
is generated from the Proportional Integral (PI) controller and the component in the 
d-axis i dsref  that is set to zero value. This control topology would help to achieve the 
required reference values, so that maximum power could be extracted and delivered 
to the DC-link of the PMSG wind turbine.PMSG Wind Turbine with Series and Bridge Fault Current Limiters 149
On the other hand, the control strategy for the GSC is shown in Figure 9.5, where 
after obtaining the MPPT from the MSC, the reference d-axis grid current i  dgref is 
generated by the DC-link voltage controllers, in order to adjust the terminal voltage 
to its steady state value. The active and reactive power which are the injected grid 
power components are controlled independently. The control of the dq components 
is done through the PI controllers’ loop that is cascaded in nature.
9.5 THE PMSG MODEL SYSTEM WITH SDBR AND BFCL
The model system of this study is shown in Figure 9.6. A system base of 5.0 MVA 
and short circuit of 16.67 MVA were used in the study and the PMSG wind turbine 
is connected to an infinite bus. The model system parameters are shown in Table 9.1
[30, 31]. On the double circuit of the model system in Figure 9.6, a severe three￾phase-to-ground fault occurred. The SDBR and BFCL are connected to the GSC of 
the PMSG wind turbine. The connection of either the SDBR or BFCL to the PMSG

wind turbine GSC would enhance its performance during grid fault. The parameters 
of the SDBR and BFCL used in this study are given in Table 9.2. The switching of 
the SDBR and BFCL is based on the grid voltage, during steady state (above 0.9 pu) 
or grid disturbance (below 0.9 pu). The analyses of SDBR and BFCL mathematical 
dynamics in the PMSG wind turbine are as follows.
The connection of the SDBR and BFCL in the PMSG-based wind turbine shown 
in Figure 9.6 is based on current control topology and not voltage [32, 33]. The resis￾tor is usually bypassed during nominal operation when the switch is conducting, 
based on the threshold value (0.9 pu) of the grid voltage used for switching purposes. 
However, during fault scenario, the switch is off. The SDBR and BFCL would limit 
the high rotor inrush current while operating, thus excessive active power would be 
achieved [34, 35]. The MSC and GSC power converters would be effectively bal￾anced, mitigating the current in the stator and the DC-link capacitor charging, as a 
result of the accumulation of these effects on the PMSG wind turbine.
The control structures of the SDBR and the BFCL are shown in Figure 9.6 model 
system. The BFCL is made up of two parts: a typical bridge circuit with four diodes 
(D1–D4) and a shunt path made up of inductor (Lsh) and resistor (Rsh) in series. There 
is an IGBT switch connected in series with an inductor (Ldc) and (Rdc) act as an intrin￾sic resistance of (Ldc) with a very small magnitude that is negligible. In the BFCL, the 
(Ldc) inductor is a DC reactor due to the fact that current flows in one direction only 
during its positive and negative half cycle of the alternating current. There is a free￾wheeling diode D5 that is connected to the DC reactor to protect the system from 
inductive kick during transient state [36]. The principle of the BFCL during opera￾tion is such that at steady state, the current flows through the D1-Ldc-Rdc-IGBT-D4
path for the positive half cycle and through the D3-IGBT-Rdc-Ldc-D2 path for the 
negative half cycle. The shunt path of the BFCL has a very high impedance, thus, the 
line current and some negligible leakage currents are on the bridge switch [37, 38].
The topology of the voltage source converter in wind energy conversion results in 
high DC-link voltage quality, capability of bidirectional flow of power, with power 
factor that is unity and few distortions of the current. Because the technology of the 
PMSG is fully decoupled from the power grid as a result of its back-to-back power 
converter, inserting the SDBR and BFCL with the grid-connected inverter in Figure 
9.7 would help understand the dynamics of the SDBR and BFCL in the PMSG wind 
turbine GSC.
From Figure 9.7, the GSC of the PMSG is connected to the R and L of the power 
grid, having currents i a = , , b c. If Cabc represents the three switching states for the 
IGBTs, then the Cabc can be replaced by βabc modulation signals. Considering Park’s

Therefore, during transient state, the maximum power transfer in the GSC of the

would also be less because of the control strategies of the SDBR and the BFCL.
9.6 EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
The model system of the PMSG wind turbine with the SDBR and BFCL was carried 
out in PSCAD/EMTDC environment. The model system was subjected to a severe 
symmetrical three-phase fault of 100 ms happening at 10.1 s, with the circuit break￾ers operation sequence opening and reclosing at 10.2 s and 11 s, respectively. The 
model system was evaluated considering three scenarios. In the first scenario, no 
control strategy of FCL was employed in the PMSG wind turbine. In the second sce￾nario, the SDBR FCL control strategy was used in the PMSG wind turbine, while the 
BFCL was implemented in the third scenario. The PMSG wind turbine was operating 
at its rated speed during the grid fault. Some of the PMSG wind turbine variables are 
shown in Figures 9.8–9.12, for the three scenarios considered in this study.PMSG Wind Turbine with Series and Bridge Fault Current Limiters 155
Figures 9.8 and 9.9 show the DC-link voltage and active power of the PMSG wind 
turbine for no control strategy, using FCL with SDBR, and with BFCL control strate￾gies. It is obvious from Figures 9.8 and 9.9 that connecting SDBR and BFCL on the 
PMSG wind turbine GSC would improve the DC-link voltage and active power vari￾ables during grid fault because of the decoupling of the PMSG wind turbine by the 
grid based on its back-to-back power converter. Using the metrics of the overshoot, 
undershoot and settling time of the variables of the wind generator, scenarios where 
the SDBR and BFCL were implemented gave better responses than no control sce￾nario. One of the technical reasons for this is based on the fact that connecting the 
SDBR and BFCL on GSC of the PMSG divides the expected high voltage in the 
stator circuitry of the PMSG wind turbine, since it is a series connection topology, 
based on the mathematical dynamics of their connection earlier explained. The per￾formance of the BFCL is better than SDBR because of the additional energy buffer 
from the inductive circuit of the BFCL.
Figure 9.10 shows that the reactive power was better controlled and dissipated 
during transient state using the BFCL than the SDBR and no control scenarios. This 
is because the inductive circuit would act as an energy buffer to the PMSG wind 
turbine, thereby controlling its reactive power. Consequently, the terminal voltage of 
the PMSG wind turbine would be improved, as shown in Figure 9.11, since reactive

power is directly proportional to voltage. The voltage variable of the PMSG wind 
turbine settled faster using the BFCL than the SDBR and no control scenarios. 
Though the SDBR gave low voltage dip and the same overshoot as the BFCL, how￾ever, its settling time is more than that of the BFCL control strategy.
In Figure 9.12, the performance of the rotor speed of the PMSG wind turbine is 
better with the use of SDBR and BFCL, than the scenario without control. The rotor

speed responses for the SDBR and BFCL scenarios are the same because their con￾trol techniques in the PMSG wind turbine have the capability to enhance the mechan￾ical output and at the same time limit the speed during grid disturbances. These 
effects would lead to fewer oscillations and improved settling time. Based on the 
presented results, employing the SDBR and BFCL at the GSC of the PMSG wind 
turbine gives room for no induced overvoltage, no loss of power converter control, 
mitigation of high current flow and no excessive charging current in the capacitor of 
the DC-link voltage of the wind generator.
9.7 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
In this chapter, the performance of the PMSG wind turbine was investigated using 
SDBR and BFCL. The grid voltage set value during grid fault was used as the switch￾ing signal for the IGBTs of both FCLs, for fair comparison. A severe symmetrical 
three-phase-to-ground fault at the terminals of the PMSG was applied to test the 
robustness of both protection schemes. Three scenarios were investigated for the 
PMSG wind turbine: no control strategy, with SDBR at the GSC and with BFCL at 
the GSC. When no control was implemented, there were substantial effects on the 
PMSG during transient state. Apparently, using the SDBR and BFCL would enhance 
the PMSG wind turbine performance. The performance of the BFCL was superior to 
that of the SDBR during transient state. Therefore, the BFCL would help solve fault 
ride through capability of PMSG wind farms even though its structure is complex, 
more than the simple SDBR topology.

Limiters

10.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Fault Current Limiters (FCLs) are hardware-based solutions in wind turbines and 
they have proven to be one of the best techniques for fulfilling the Fault Ride 
Through (FRT) or LVRT requirements, as set by the grid codes [1]. The tech￾nology of FCLs comprises two categories: SFCL and Non-superconducting Fault 
Current Limiter (NSFCL). There is no loss of power during nominal operation 
in SFCLs, and very high-speed control could be achieved. Though complex con￾figuration may be required for maintenance purposes in this type of FRT solu￾tion [2–4]. However, the NSFCLs technology can effectively compensate for the 
shortcomings of SFCLs and at the same time improve the LVRT capability [5, 6]. 
The use of semiconductor devices such as Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) and 
Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) gave way for the NSFCLs more than 
others. Consequently, the control strategies of Series Dynamic Braking Resistors 
(SDBRs) [7, 8], Bridge Fault Current Limiters (BFCLs) with resistive, induc￾tive and capacitive elements [5, 9], series resonance type FCL [6] and Parallel 
Resonance Type FCL (PRFCL) [10] show improved performance of variable speed 
DFIG-based wind turbines. Among the BFCLs, the Capacitive Bridge-type Fault 
Current Limiter (CBFCL) is newly introduced to enhance the traditional BFCL 
and the FRT of wind turbines [11–13]. One of the main reasons for this could be 
due to the fact that it provides reasonable reactive power that is required to recover 
the terminal voltage of the wind generators and the entire system during transient 
state, compared to the other BFCLs.
This chapter targets the improved performance of PMSG-based wind generators, 
considering different control topologies of FCL. The FCL considered are the SDBR 
control strategy, the traditional BFCL and the CBFCL. The mathematical dynamics 
of the three FCLs in the PMSG wind turbine were presented during steady and tran￾sient states of the wind turbine. The same switching strategy based on the grid volt￾age during fault condition was used for all three FCLs for fair comparison. The 
robustness of the controllers of the PMSG wind turbine was tested using severe 
three-phase-to-ground fault in Power System Computer Aided Design and 
Electromagnetic Transient Including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC) environment.162 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
10.2 THE PMSG MODEL SYSTEM WITH THE DIFFERENT FAULT 
CURRENT LIMITERS
The model system of this study is shown in Figure 10.1, where the PMSG wind tur￾bine is connected to an infinite bus, with a system base of 5.0 MVA and a short circuit 
of 16.67 MVA. The parameters of the model system are given in Table 10.1 [14, 
15]. A severe balanced three-phase-to-ground fault occurred on the double circuit 
of the model system. The three FCLs are connected to the GSC of the PMSG wind 
turbine as shown in the model system. The connection of the FCLs to the PMSG 
wind turbine would improve its performance during transient state. The effective 
parameters of the FCLs are given in Table 10.2. The dynamics of the three FCLs in 
the PMSG wind turbine are given in the subsequent subsections. The switching of 
the three FCLs is based on the grid voltage, as shown in the model system, during 
normal state when the grid voltage is above 0.9 pu and during fault conditions when 
it is less than 0.9 pu.
10.2.1 PMSG Wind Turbine with SDBR
The connection of the SDBR in the PMSG-based wind turbine is shown in 
Figure 10.2. SDBR control strategy is based on current and not voltage [16, 17]. The 
resistor is bypassed during nominal operation when the switch is conducting, based 
on the threshold value of the grid voltage. However, during fault scenario, the switch 
is off. The switching strategy is based on the grid voltage, as explained earlier in 
Section 10.2 and shown in Figure 10.1. The SDBR would limit the high rotor inrush 
current while operating, thus excessive active power would be achieved [18, 19]. Due 
to these effects, the MSC and GSC power converters would be effectively balanced, 
reducing the current in the stator and the DC-link capacitor charging.
The GSC of the PMSG wind turbine is connected to the R and L parameters of the 
grid, with AC currents i a = , , b c. If Cabc represents the three switching states for the 
IGBTs, then the Cabc converter functions can be substituted by βabc signals of modu￾lation. Considering Park’s transformation, the voltage source converter of the PMSG 
could be modeled for a balanced three-phase as [20]:

10.2.2 PMSG Wind Turbine with BFCL
The control structures of a BFCL are shown in Figure 10.3, and it is basically made 
up of two distinctive parts, as earlier discussed in Chapter 9. The BFCL main part is PMSG with Capacitive Bridge Fault Current Limiters 167
a typical bridge circuit with four diodes (D1–D4), while the shunt path made up of 
inductor (Lsh) and resistor (Rsh) in series forms the other part of the BFCL circuit. An 
IGBT switch is connected in series with an inductor (Ldc), and (Rdc) act as an intrinsic 
resistance of (Ldc) with very small magnitude that is negligible. In the BFCL, the 
(Ldc) inductor is a DC reactor due to the fact that current flows in one direction only 
through it during positive and negative half cycles of the alternating current. There is a 
free-wheeling diode D5 that is connected to the DC reactor to protect the system from 
inductive kick during transient state [21]. The working principle of the BFCL is such 
that during normal or steady state, the current flows through the D1-Ldc-Rdc-IGBT￾D4 path for the positive half cycle and through the D3-IGBT-Rdc-Ldc-D2 path for the 
negative half cycle. It should be noted that the shunt path of the BFCL has a very high 
impedance, making the bridge switch carry the line current and some negligible leak￾age currents [20, 22]. The control strategy of the BFCL used in this chapter is based 
on the threshold grid voltage, which is the same for the SDBR control strategy for fair 
comparison. The parameters of the BFCL were already given in Table 10.2.
10.2.3 PMSG Wind Turbine with the CBFCL
The CBFCL circuit has four diodes with a switching circuitry of a DC reactor (LD) 
and (rD), as shown in Figure 10.4. The shunt path is made up of a capacitor Csh with 
a series resistor Rsh. In addition, there are two fast recovery diodes (D5 and D6) in the 
bridge circuit. The parameters of the CBFCL are shown in Table 10.2 and the switch￾ing strategy is the same as those of the SDBR and BFCL, for effective comparative 
study. For practical realization of the operation of the capacitor in a high voltage, 
the control input which is the duty cycle of a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM), is a 
function of VC S , , V VL in the equivalent circuit of Figure 10.5. The generated pulses 
from the PWM signal generator are used to drive the IGBTs so that the fault current 
could be suppressed. The mathematical dynamic model of the CBFCL in PMSG 
wind turbine based on on-state (normal or steady state operation) and off-state (grid 
fault scenario) is described as follows.
FIGURE 10.3 Control structure of BFCL in PMSG wind turbine.168 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
The on-state equation is based on the Kirchoff’s voltage law being applied to the 
terminals of the equivalent circuit of the bridge in Figure 10.4, shown in Figure 10.5.

10.3 CONTROL STRATEGY OF THE PMSG WIND TURBINE
The control structure of the PMSG wind turbine is shown in Figure 10.7, where the 
full power converter is used for isolation of the wind generator from the power net￾work, for better protection during grid fault. This is because the grid faults have huge 
impact on the direct drive wind energy conversion technology. The MSC regulates 
the active and reactive power of the PMSG by carrying out abc to dq transformation 
using angle position rotor (θr
) computed from the rotor speed. The d-axis and q-axis 
currents (Isd), (Isq) control active power (Ps) and reactive power (Qs) of the PMSG 
FIGURE 10.6 Off-state Equivalent CBFCL in PMSG wind turbine.170 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
wind turbine. The reference active power (Pref) is derived from the MPPT of the wind 
turbine characteristics earlier discussed, while the reference reactive power (Qs
∗
) is 
fixed at 0, for unity power factor. (Vsa
∗
, Vsb
∗
, Vsc
∗
) are generated as reference voltages 
switching, considering references Vsd
∗ and Vsq
∗ voltages.
The GSC control considers the d-q rotating reference frame and the voltage of the 
power grid along with the speed of rotation. (Iga, Igb, Igc) three-phase currents and (Vga, 
Vgb, Vgc) three-phase voltages are converted to their rotating reference d-q frame. The 
phase angle (θg) on the GSC is obtained from the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) struc￾ture. For effective grid voltage transformation, Vgd is adjusted to a constant and Vgq to 
zero, in the stationary reference frame and the rotating reference d-q frame. The 
d-axis current (Igd) and the q-axis current (Igq), regulate the active and reactive power 
that the PMSG is dissipating to the grid. Vgd
∗ and Vgq
∗ are transformed to (Vga
∗ , Vgb
∗ , Vgc
∗ ) 
and used for switching purpose. The DC-link voltage (Vdc) is usually kept at unity for 
effective active power transfer. The DC-link determines the d-axis current (Igd
∗ ) refer￾ence signal, while the reactive power determines the q-axis current (Igq
∗ ) reference 
FIGURE 10.7 Control strategy of the PMSG wind turbine.PMSG with Capacitive Bridge Fault Current Limiters 171
signal. The voltage is proportional to the reactive power, making the terminal wind 
turbine voltage to be kept at 1.0 pu.
10.4 EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
The evaluation of the model system of PMSG wind turbine with the FCLS was done 
using PSCAD/EMTDC [23]. A severe three-phase fault of 100 ms happening at 10.1 
s, with the circuit breakers operation sequence opening and reclosing at 10.2 s and 
11 s, respectively, was considered in this study. The switching frequency used for the 
MSC is 1000 Hz, while that of the GSC is 1050 Hz. The solution time step is 10 μS. 
The evaluation of the system performance was done considering the position of the 
SDBR, BFCL and CBFCL at the GSC of the PMSG wind turbine [24]. A scenario 
where no control was implemented in the PMSG wind turbine without considering 
any of the FCLs was also investigated. The PMSG wind generator was operating at 
its rated speed during the grid fault. Figures 10.8a–10.12 show the performances of 
the various variables of the PMSG wind turbine, and the zooms of these figures are 
shown in Figures 10.8(b)–10.12(b).
Figures 10.8a and 10.9 show the active power and DC-link voltage of the PMSG 
wind turbine for no FCL control and with SDBR, BFCL and CBFCL control

strategy. From the responses of these figures, inserting SDBR, BFCL and CBFCL 
on the GSC of the PMSG wind turbine has major effect on the active power and 
DC-link voltage during transient state. This is because the PMSG wind turbine is 
decoupled fully from the power grid using back-to-back power converter. The 
undershoot, overshoot and settling time of the active power and DC-link voltage 
are better in Figures 10.8a and 10.9 with the scenarios of the FCLs, compared to 
when no FCL was employed. Connecting the SDBR on GSC of the PMSG ensures 
the expected high voltage of the wind generator stator circuitry is divided because 
of the series connection strategy. However, the performance of the CBFCL is better 
than those of the SDBR and the BFCL, because of the additional energy buffer 
from the capacitive circuit of the CBFCL. Figure 10.10 shows that the reactive 
power was better controlled using the CBFCL than the other FCLs and when no 
FCL was employed. Due to the capacitive circuit of the CBFCL in the PMSG wind 
turbine during transient state, the reactive power of the wind turbine would be 
enhanced.
In Figure 10.11(a), the performance of the rotor speed of the PMSG wind turbine 
is better with the use of FCLs. The responses of the rotor speed are the same for the 
FCLs in both steady and transient states. This is because the FCL control technique 
in the PMSG wind turbine has the ability to improve its mechanical output slightly in 
steady state and limit its speed during transient state. Therefore, the performance of 
the rotor speed in Figure 10.11(a) would be with fewer oscillations and faster settling 
time. Furthermore, because of the ability of the SDBR to boost the reactive power 
dissipation as shown in Figure 10.10, the terminal voltage of the PMSG wind turbine 
would be more improved as shown in Figure 10.12. The performance of the SDBR 
FCL is better than the BFCL and CBFCL for the PMSG wind turbine during tran￾sient state. The response of the BFCL and CBFCL are the same for the terminal volt￾age of the PMSG during transient, though with faster settling time than the SDBR 
FCL. Table 10.3 shows the numerical index performance of the different FCLs based 
on the presented simulation results. In general, the use of the FCLs in the PMSG 
wind turbine would result in no power converter loss in control, with little or no 
induced overvoltage. The FCLs topology would also reduce high current flow, lead￾ing to no dangerous overvoltage and excessive charging current in the power con￾verter’s DC-link capacitor. Although the PMSG wind turbines are more expensive 
than the DFIG and Squirrel Cage Induction Generator (SCIG) wind turbines; how￾ever, they have better FRT or LVRT performances. By adding additional FCL protec￾tion topologies, to the PMSG, the overall cost would not be marginally high, due to 
the fact that the FCLs are cheap switching devices. The advancements in power elec￾tronic technologies would further drastically reduce the cost of the FCLs embedded 
in the PMSG wind turbines. As part of future work, the proportional integral control￾lers for PMSG wind turbines would be replaced by the dragon fly optimization 
algorithm.174 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
10.5 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
The improved performances of the PMSG wind turbine considering FCLs based on 
SDBR, bridge-type FCL and CBFCL were investigated in this chapter. The same 
threshold value of the power grid voltage during transient state was used as the 
switching strategy for the considered FCLs, for effective comparison. The responses 
of the FCLs were investigated considering a severe three-phase-to-ground fault at 
the terminals of the PMSG. A scenario where no FCL was employed in the PMSG 
was also investigated. From the obtained results, when no FCL was implemented, the 
PMSG wind turbine experienced substantial consequences during fault. The use of 
the FCLs improved the performance of the PMSG wind turbine. However, CBFCL 
performance was superior to the SDBR and BFCL under severe fault condition. The 
CBFCL provides smoother and faster response with better overshoot and fast settling 
time for most of the PMSG variables than the other FCLs. Though the SDBR FCL 
performed better in the terminal voltage response of the PMSG wind turbine during 
fault scenario with regard to faster recovery of the terminal voltage; however, the 
settling time was lower than those of the BFCL and CBFCL. Therefore, the CBFCL 
provides a good example of solving and improving the FRT or low voltage ride 
through capability of PMSG wind farms.

11.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
As the amount of wind energy penetration into existing power grids is increasing 
by the day, with an average forecast of 75 GW per year over the 2021–2026 period 
[1], it is very vital to learn new methods of stabilizing the power grids, for smooth 
operation [1, 2]. The grid requirements that are recently emerging as a guild to oper￾ate wind farms require robust voltage and frequency controls. The technology of 
variable speed wind turbines is mostly employed because of the extensive range of 
wind speed operation [3]. For wind energy conversion, the Doubly Fed Induction 
Generator (DFIG) and the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) are 
the two basic variable speed wind turbines usually used in modern wind farms. The 
revolution in power electronics and drives in control mechanisms has contributed 
greatly to the advancements of wind turbines from fixed speed to variable speed tech￾nology [4, 5]. Simplicity of operation, rugged construction, low cost and little main￾tenance are some of the merits of the fixed speed wind turbines. However, the huge 
requirement of large reactive during grid disturbance, in order to survive recovery 
of air gap flux and no control for voltage and frequency are some of the major con￾cerns of this class of wind turbines that make them limited in wind energy applica￾tions. Consequently, modern wind farms are built using variable speed wind turbines 
because of their high energy capture efficiency, good voltage control and reduced 
mechanical drive train stresses [6]. The technologies of the DFIG and PMSG wind 
turbines have power converters that are connected back to back. While the DFIG has 
a gearbox system and a power converter rating of 20–30%, the PMSG has high initial 
cost because of its fully rated power converters.
The technology of the DFIG is such a way that Rotor Side Converter (RSC), 
otherwise known as the Machine Side Converter (MSC), and the Stator Side Comparative Study of DFIG and PMSG 179
Converter (SSC), otherwise known as the Grid Side Converter (GSC), is connected 
between the DC-link voltage, for easy regulation of active and reactive power. For 
effective energy capture, this class of wind turbine operates in a wide range [7, 8] 
and has a good pitch control mechanism that helps rebuild its voltage after grid dis￾turbance [9, 10].
The technology of the PMSG wind turbine is such a way that its back-to-back 
power converter is fully rated, unlike the DFIG wind turbine technology that is par￾tially rated. Consequently, the maximum flexibility and better control of real and 
reactive power are more likely in this class of wind turbine. Though, the high initial 
cost of the PMSG is quite discouraging
The separate control strategies of DFIG and PMSG wind turbines using various 
schemes already exist in the literature, ranging from Fault Current Limiters (FCLs) 
in the DFIG wind turbines [11–14], reactive power compensation, crowbar and DC 
chopper [15, 16] and sliding mode control for Maximum Power Point Tracking 
(MPPT) [17, 18]. The Fault Ride Through (FRT) assessment of a DFIG wind turbine 
was carried out in [19–21], with the help of different control topologies, and algo￾rithms for wind energy conversion were reported in [22]. On the other hand, for the 
PMSG wind turbine, the limitation of the maximum current, and MPPT power con￾verters were studied in [23, 24], where the DC-link voltage was kept constant near its 
limit during grid fault. The enhancement of PMSG wind turbine was also done in 
[25], using the Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) control strategy.
The hardware-based solutions of FCLs in DFIG and PMSG wind turbines in wind 
farms have shown promising results in augmenting the performance of these wind 
turbines during grid faults [26]. There are two types of FCLs: SFCL having no power 
loss, with good speed control, though complex circuitries [27–29] and Non￾superconducting Fault Current Limiter (NSFCL) that can resolve the issues of the 
SFCLs, in addition to providing FRT capabilities [30, 31]. The Insulated Gate Bipolar 
Transistor (IGBT) technology led to the wider use of NSFCLs than the others. The 
Series Dynamic Braking Resistors (SDBRs) [32, 33] and Bridge Fault Current 
Limiters (BFCLs) having resistive, inductive and capacitive elements [34] and 
Parallel Resonance FCL (PRFCL) [35] have been employed in variable speed wind 
turbines FRT.
In this chapter, the augmentation analyses of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines 
regarding stability issues experienced by DFIG and PMSG wind turbines were inves￾tigated considering various existing FCLs. The details of the wind turbine modeling 
characteristics of both wind generators were presented along with their control topol￾ogies. Both wind turbines were subjected to a severe bolted three-line-to-ground 
fault, without any protection or enhancement scheme of the FCL, to test the robust￾ness of the controllers. The mathematical dynamics of inserting SDBR, BFCL and 
CBFCL at the stator of both wind turbines considering the same condition of opera￾tion, for fair comparison were also presented. The same effective size of the SDBR 
and the same parameters of the BFCL and CBFCL were used for both wind turbine 
technologies. The grid voltage was used as the switching signal, during grid fault. 
There are a limited number of reports in the literature that considered the scenarios 
of these FCLs in both wind turbines. Most reports in the literature considered these 
scenarios on a separate basis FRT enhancement of both wind generators. The study 180 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
was carried out using Power System Computer Aided Design and Electromagnetic 
Transient Including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC) environment [36].
11.2 MODELING AND CONTROL
The details of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbine modeling and characteristics have 
already been presented in earlier chapters of this book (Chapters 1–10). Readers 
should refer to these chapters for more details.
11.3 DFIG AND PMSG MODEL SYSTEMS WITH THE FAULT 
CURRENT LIMITERS
The model systems of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines with the three FCLs are 
shown in Figures 11.1 and 11.2. The parameters of the wind turbines and those of 
the FCLs are given in Tables 11.1 and 11.2. The mathematical dynamics of the three 
FCLs are presented in the subsequent section of this chapter.

11.4.2 SDBR in PMSG Wind Turbines
The dynamics of the SDBR in DFIG wind turbines are represented in Figure 11.4. 
Based on Park’s transformation, the PMSG grid-connected voltage source converter 
could be modeled in rotating frame. The mathematical model for the balanced three￾phase voltage source converter in Figure 11.2 is given as [39]:

From Equations (11.9) to (11.12), id , iq represent the dq current input of the recti￾fier’s axes, ed, eq are known as the dq voltage of the grid voltage axes components, ω
is the angular frequency voltage, βd, βq represent the modulating signal of the recti￾fier’s d and q axes components, while r is the modulation signal vector norm. 
Considering three-phase transformation based on Park’s principle, and that the 
phase-A grid voltage is in alignment with the dq reference synchronous frame, the 
source voltage dq components are given as:
e E d m = (11.13)
eq = 0 (11.14)
FIGURE 11.4 Dynamics of SDBR in PMSG wind turbines.Comparative Study of DFIG and PMSG 185

To achieve power factor in unity mode of operation, iq r _ ef can be set to 0. Therefore, 
for the current regulation to be ideal, i i q ref = = q 0. With iq = 0 and RL, the mathemati￾cal model of the voltage source converter under unity power factor can be expressed 
with the following set of equations:

Equation (11.18) implies in order to ensure operation of unity power factor of the 
voltage source converter, the component of Udc , should proportionally vary with βd
current. From Equations (11.17) and (11.19), the capacity charge is manipulated by 
βd, via the id current of the input.
The insertion of the SDBR resistance during transient state in the PMSG converter 
would affect the maximal power flow and the DC output voltage. During normal 
condition, the derivative operator relating all terms in Equations (11.17)–(11.19), 
would be zero. Thus, the new set of equations would be:

Based on Equation (11.32), the maximum power transfer of the GSC of the PMSG 
during transient state would be reduced by the insertion of SDBR in the GSC. 
Therefore, the total current reduces its value, thus mitigating the oscillations that 
normally occur during transient conditions. The SDBR control for both wind tur￾bines is shown in Figure 11.1 and 11.2, considering the threshold grid voltage during 
grid fault.
11.5 DYNAMICS OF BFCL AND CBFL ON DFIG AND PMSG WIND

11.5.1 DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines with BFCL
The BFCL control is the same as the SDBR control shown in Figure 11.1 and 11.2, 
considering the threshold grid voltage during grid fault. Figure 11.5 shows the BFCL 
architecture, with the main bridge circuit having four diodes (D1-D4) and a shunt path 
having inductor (Lsh) and resistor (Rsh) in series. The inductor (Ldc) is connected to 
an IGBT switch. (Ldc) inductor DC reactor having current flow in only one direction 
for positive and negative half cycles of AC. D5 is a free-wheeling diode used for 
protection of inductive kick when there is grid disturbance [40]. In a steady state, for 
positive half cycle, the current flows through the D1-Ldc-Rdc-IGBT-D4 path and for 
negative half cycle, D3-IGBT-Rdc-Ldc-D2. The impedance of the shunt path is very 
high, so the line current flows through the bridge switch with some negligible leak￾age currents [41, 42].

11.5.2 DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines with CBFCL
The switching strategy of the CBFCL is the same as the SDBR and BFCL. Figure 11.6
shows the CBFCL architecture with four diodes, DC reactor (LD) and (rD) switch￾ing circuitries and shunt path having Csh and series resistor Rsh. (D5 and D6) act as 
fast recovery diodes. The following mathematical dynamics would help understand 
the behavior of the CBFCL in DFIG and PMSG wind turbines during normal and 
transient states.
From Kirchoff’s voltage law, the on-state equations could be derived by applying this 
law to the equivalent circuit of the bridge in Figure 11.6, shown in Figure 11.7. Thus:

11.6 EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
Efforts were made to run simulation studies for both wind generators in order to 
compare their FRT characteristics using the different FCLs. A severe three-phase 
to-ground fault of 100 ms happening at 10.1 s, with the circuit breakers operation 
sequence opening and reclosing at 10.2 s and 11 s, respectively, on the faulted line 
close to the terminals of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines, was investigated. The 
fault performance with and without considering stability augmentation tools of the 
SDBR, BFCL and CBFCL are presented below in detail [43].
11.6.1 Performance of the DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
Considering SDBR and BFCL
The DFIG and PMSG wind turbines were subjected to a severe grid fault in the 
model system considering no insertion of the SDBR and BFCL, and with the inser￾tion of the SDBR and BFCL. Some of the simulation results of the variables of the 
wind turbines are presented in Figures 11.9–11.13.
From Figure 11.9, the overshoot experienced by DFIG and PMSG DC-link volt￾age during grid fault could lead to the damage of fragile and vulnerable power

While the PMSG wind turbine has more overshoot and slower settling time, the 
DFIG wind turbine has more DC-link voltage dip, with faster settling time. Less volt￾age dip is achieved with the use of the SDBR in the DFIG than when BFCL was used, 
while the worst-case scenario was when no control was employed. On the other

hand, for the PMSG wind turbine, better performance of the DC-link voltage was 
achieved using the BFCL with less overshoot than when the SDBR was employed. 
The same analogy goes for the active power variable in Figure 11.10, with the SDBR 
performing better in the DFIG wind turbine, while the BFCL in the PMSG wind 
turbine. The responses for the reactive power and rotor speed are shown in Figures 
11.11 and 11.12. The reactive power of the wind turbines was effectively controlled 
using the SDBR and BFCL, while there was minimal influence of the FCLs on the 
rotor speed of the wind turbines. The influence of the FCLs is more obvious in the 
terminal voltage response of the PMSG shown in Figure 11.13, during the grid fault 
than the DFIG. When no control was implemented in both wind turbines, more over￾shoot and less settling time were observed in the variable of the terminal voltage. 
However, the SDBR gave a quicker recovery of the terminal voltage variable than the 
BFCL. Based on the above analysis, the use of the FCLs is more obvious for the 
PMSG than the DFIG because the PMSG-based wind turbine is decoupled fully from 
the power grid due to its back-to-back power converter. Consequently, the operation 
of the wind turbines is a critical situation during faulty condition, when no FCL is 
implemented. In light of this, the subsequent sections of this chapter would consider 
the investigation of the CBFCL on the two wind turbines separately, in order to know 
its impact, compared to the SDBR and the BFCL topologies.
11.6.2 Performance of the DFIG Wind Turbine Considering SDBR, 
BFCL and CBFCL
The performance of the DFIG was further investigated, considering the CBFCL in 
addition to those obtained using the SDBR and BFCL. Some of the simulation results 
are presented in Figures 11.14–11.17. In Figure 11.14, the SDBR outperforms the 
BFCL and the CBFCL, with improved undershoot, overshoot and faster settling 
time. However, more reactive power was dissipated by the use of the BFCL and the 
CBFCL in the GSC of the DFIG wind turbine as shown in Figure 11.15. The effect 
of the FCLs on the terminal voltage is shown in Figures 11.16 and 11.17. In Figures 
11.16 and 11.17, when no FCL scheme was considered, the terminal voltage recov￾ered slowly, however, with the use of the SDBR, the voltage recovery was faster

than the use of the BFCL and CBFCL control strategies. Some of the reasons for the 
improved performance of the SDBR over the BFCL and the CBFCL are the SDBR 
has more capability in responding faster during the grid fault by reducing the high 
current flow, at the same time, ensuring no overvoltage is induced, thus leading to no 
power converter control loss.

The performance of the PMSG wind turbine was also investigated in this section con￾sidering the CBFCL, in addition to those obtained using the SDBR and BFCL. Some 
of the simulation results are presented in Figures 11.18–11.20 during the grid fault. 
In Figures 11.18 and 11.19, the CBFCL performed better than the SDBR and BFCL 
schemes, with improved undershoot, overshoot and faster settling time. However, 
the SDBR scheme performed better than the BFCL and the CBFCL schemes in the 
recovery of the terminal voltage, with faster settling time and voltage dip. Some of 
the reasons for the improved performance of the SDBR scheme in the voltage vari￾able of the PMSG were the same as given for the DFIG wind turbine. Apart from 
the voltage variable of the PMSG wind turbine, the performance of the CBFCL was 
better in other variables of the PMSG wind turbine during grid fault.

11.7 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
This chapter presented a comparative analysis of the augmentation performance of 
DFIG and PMSG wind turbines with the same machine ratings, during grid fault 
considering different FCLs. The considered FCLs were the SDBR, BFCL and the 
Capacitive Bridge Fault Current Limiter (CBFCL). The wind turbines were oper￾ated under the same conditions. Both wind turbines were affected by the connection 
of the FCLs in their stators during severe grid disturbance. However, the influence 
of the FCLs was more observed in the PMSG wind turbine compared to the DFIG 
wind turbine. This is due to the fact that the PMSG wind turbine technology enables 
the decoupling of its full back-to-back power converters at the power grid. When no 
control strategy of FCLs was implemented in the wind turbines, critical situation of 
operation during faulty conditions would result, making the DC-link voltage dip to 
almost 0.0 pu, with overshoot of 110% and high settling time of over 0.4 s for the 
DFIG, while for the PMSG an overshoot of 130%, DC-link voltage of 0.4 pu and 
over 0.5 s of settling time was observed. The performance of the DFIG wind turbine 
was better using the SDBR, than the use of BFCL and CBFCL control schemes, with 
improved numerical index performance of 0.7 pu, 0.3 pu and 0.3 pu, for the DFIG and 
0.7 pu, 0.8 pu and 0.8 pu, for the PMSG, respectively. Also, faster settling time was 
also recovered using the FCLs for both wind turbines. On the other hand, the perfor￾mances of the PMSG variables were better using the CBFCL, than the SDBR and the 
BFCL control strategies, except for the terminal grid voltage variable. Therefore, it 
is recommended to use either of the FCLs with DFIG or PMSG-based variable speed 
wind turbine to get superior FRT performance, based on the intended purpose.

DFIG and PMSG 
Wind Turbines Life 
Cycle Cost Analysis
12
12.1 CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Despite the proliferation of wind farms and the high penetration of wind turbines in 
existing power grids, the maintenance costs for wind turbines are usually high, and 
this would hinder the wide utilization of wind power to help achieve the target of wind 
turbine installations [1]. The frequent occurrence of faults in the DFIG and PMSG 
wind turbines would cause unexpected downtimes leading to high maintenance cost 
and production losses [2]. Consequently, there is need for optimal maintenance topol￾ogies and decisions in order to cut down costs [3]. The employment of Life Cycle 
Cost (LCC) analysis could help in this regard as a fundamental tool to achieve a 
more cost-effective maintenance strategy for the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines. 
This would definitely boost wind power and create a competitive electricity price. In 
order to mitigate maintenance costs in DFIG and PMSG wind turbines, Condition 
Monitoring Systems (CMS) may be a reliable tool. CMS is commonly employed in 
industries to constantly monitor the performance of the generator, gearbox and trans￾former of wind turbines and help predict best time for maintenance. Most wind tur￾bine manufacturing companies are developing and testing CMS [4], by carrying out 
vibrations analysis, especially for DFIG and PMSG wind turbine wheels, bearings 
in the gearbox and generator, along with the use of microprocessor-based systems to 
automate lubricating oil analysis in the gearbox and drive train system of the wind 
turbines. Based on this, it is easier to know the best and most cost-effective period 
for oil change [5]. Reliability-centered Maintenance (RCM) is a further step of CMS, 
with focus on the reliability aspects during maintenance. This is done by giving prior￾ity to critical components in the wind turbines with regard to maintenance tasks [6].
12.2 FUNDAMENTAL AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
In this section, some fundamental and theoretical terminologies would be discussed 
with regard to the concept of LCC analysis.
12.2.1 Reliability, Availability and Downtime
Reliability could be defined as “the ability of an item to perform a required function 
under given conditions for a given time interval” [7], without fail, while availability 
is the “ability to be in a state to perform as and when required, under given condi￾tions, assuming that the necessary external resources are provided” [7].202 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
Mathematically, the average availability of any device or equipment could be 
expressed as [8]:
Aav
MTTF
MTTF MTTR = +
(12.1)
where MTTF is the Mean Time to Failure, measured in hours [h], and this defines the 
average operating time of the item, while MTTR is the Mean Time to Repair, mea￾sured in hours [h], and this expresses the average of the times required to restoration 
after failures of the item.
Downtime is the “time interval throughout which an item is in a down state” [7]. 
Figure 12.1(a) and (b) shows downtimes due to replacements. Figure 12.1(a) shows the 
MTTR of Corrective Maintenance (CM), during actual failure, while Figure 12.1(b)

illustrates the MTTR in case of Preventive Maintenance (PM), where no actual failure 
occurred, rather only a preventive replacement.
12.2.2  Operation and Maintenance Cost, Failure Mode and Effects
Analysis
The DFIG and PMSG wind turbines need regular checks during the course of their 
lifetime, and these associated costs are the operations and maintenance costs. Failure 
Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is used in operations management for the analysis 
of failure modes in inductive failure analysis within a system, based on the severity and 
likelihood of the failures in a classified manner. One of the key benefits of a good FMEA 
is that it helps to know the potential failure modes based on previous data with the same 
sample space in other to reduce costs of development. Basically, the total cost of DFIG 
and PMSG wind turbines during their lifetime could be computed by the sums of all 
expenses during their lifetime. It should be noted that this total cost is divided into three 
categories: installation costs of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines, capital costs of the 
DFIG and PMSG wind turbines and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs. The ratio 
of the total money invested in a wind farm project to the actual number of DFIG and 
PMSG wind turbines gives the total installation costs, while the interest on the money 
invested in building the DFIG and PMSG wind farms is known as the capital costs.
12.3 LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS OF THE DFIG AND PMSG WIND 
TURBINES
The definition of the LCC concept could be expressed as [7]: “all the costs generated 
during the life cycle of an item.” This terminology is usually used for cost saving in 
investments and it relates to the computational strategies of total lifetime costs of the 
item. Furthermore, this concept promotes comparative cost assessment over a given 
period of time, considering the relevant economic factors based on initial capital 
and future operational costs [10]. The comparison of different investment options is 
also possible based on the LCC concept, by estimating the actual investment costs, 
considering the initial investment cost and other related costs to the item’s whole 
lifetime. Mathematically, the LCC could be expressed as [11]:
LCC = + C C INV CM P + + C C M PL R +C EM (12.2)
where CINV is the input cost of investment, CCM is the cost for CM, CPM is the cost 
PM, CPL is the cost for production loss and CREM is the remainder value.
12.3.1  Production Losses of the DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
In the course of the lifetime of the DFIG and PMSG wind turbines, failures may 
occur and this would lead to unexpected downtimes. In light of this, it is possible to 
determine the production losses cost by using the following expression [12]:
C N PL = P Cf e C Dl . . . . (12.3)204 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
where N is the number of DFIG or PMSG wind turbines, P is the generated electric 
power, Cf is the capacity factor, which is defined as the ratio of the actual power gen￾erated to the maximum power that could be generated, expressed as:
C P
P f out = max
(12.4)
Cel is the cost of electricity and D is the downtime expressed in hours.
12.3.2  Preventive Maintenance of the DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
Any maintenance that is undertaken before failures happen is known as PM. It is 
classified into two: preventive scheduled maintenance, which is the PM done in 
accordance with an established time schedule [13] and preventive condition-based 
maintenance, which is the PM done based on performance and parameter monitoring 
and subsequent actions. For accurate prediction of when maintenance is required, the 
history of when, how and why the component has failed is important [11]. The good 
motivation for any DFIG and PMSG wind turbines PM topology is that of reduced 
cost of PM measures lower than no action [14].
12.3.3  Corrective Maintenance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
The maintenance done after fault recognition with the intention to put an item into a 
state in which it can perform a required function is known as CM [13]. This means 
that no maintenance is required as long as the item is working, however, the item is 
fixed or repaired or removed when is not working anymore. The scenario where little 
or no PM is carried out would result in more system failures requiring more CM. The 
PV method can be used to compare future payments over a certain time at one point 
in the present time. The Present Value (PV) of the item is the current amount of the 
item at a certain rate (d) to pay for an outlay (C) after n years. This implies that all 
future payments are recomputed to the equivalent value for the present time. The PV 
of one outlay (C) to be paid after n number of years is gained by the product of this 
value and the PV factor PVf ( ) n d, expressed as [15]:
PV = PVf ( ) = + ( )−
C n d C d n
. , . 1 (12.5)
Figure 12.2 shows the different maintenance strategies that could be applied to the 
DFIG and PMSG wind turbines, while Figure 12.3 displays the component condi￾tions based on different strategies.
12.3.4 Reliability-Centered Maintenance
A more structured approach that concerns reliability aspects during maintenance 
plans of an item is known as RCM [16]. This concept would help in balancing PM 
and CM and would enhance the best PM activities to be carried out for the right com￾ponents of the wind turbines at the right time to achieve the most efficient solutions DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines Life Cycle Cost Analysis 205
FIGURE 12.2 Different maintenance strategies [13].
FIGURE 12.3 The conditions of the components based on the different maintenance strate￾gies [9].206 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
[15]. Thus, RCM could be termed as one strategy to improve the reliability of physi￾cal assets.
12.4 TYPICAL LEVELIZED COST OF ENERGY FOR WIND FARM 
PROJECTS
This section gives a brief about representative of utility-scale and distributed wind 
energy projects in order to estimate the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for both 
land-based and offshore wind power plants that could be made up of DFIG and 
PMSG wind turbines. The data and the presented results in this section were based 
on the 2019 commissioned plants and representative industry data considering the 
state-of-the-art modeling capabilities in the US case study as reported in [17]. The 
modeling carried out is geared toward more granular details on specific cost catego￾ries. The case study in [17] is based on the 2019 installed land-based wind project 
data and costs that could be applied to wind turbines for wind farm development 
and are primarily obtained from Wiser and Bolinger [18]. However, the data were 
supplemented with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [19] outputs 
cost models for wind turbines and balance-of-system details.
This section estimates the LCOE for land-based and offshore wind projects. 
LCOE is a metric employed to assess the cost of generating electricity, considering 
the total level impact of the plants based on technological changes in design com￾pared to the costs of all types of generations possible.
For wind farm projects, the mathematical expression for LCOE is:
LCOE
CapEx FCR OpEx
AEPnet = ( ) × +
( ) / , 1 000 (12.6)
where
LCOE is the Levelized Cost of Energy ($/megawatt-hour [MWh]),
FCR is the fixed charge rate (%),
CapEx is the capital expenditures ($/kilowatt [kW]),
AEPnet is the net average annual energy production (MWh/megawatt [MW]/
year [yr]) and
OpEx is the operational expenditures ($/kW/yr).
In Equation (12.6), CapEx, OpEx and AEPnet are the first three basic inputs that 
enable the equation to capture system-level impacts as a result of design changes 
due to larger rotors or taller wind turbine towers of the DFIG and PMSG wind tur￾bines. FCR is the fourth-basic input that gives the amount of revenue required to pay 
the annual carrying charges as applied to the CapEx on that investment during the 
expected project economic life. Figures 12.4–12.7 show the capital expenditures and 
LCOE expenditures for land and offshore wind reference projects considering the 
case of the United States [17].
Figure 12.4 shows that the Nacelle, the rotor and the tower of the DFIG or PMSG 
wind turbines, hold a large share of the capital expenditures for land-based wind farm DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines Life Cycle Cost Analysis 207
FIGURE 12.4 Capital expenditure for the land-based reference wind farm power project [17].
FIGURE 12.5 Component-level LCOE contribution for the 2019 land-based-wind farm ref￾erence project operating for 25 years [17].208 Performance of DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines
projects. In Figure 12.4, the turbine system accounts for 69% of the total capital 
expenditure compared to the balance of the system with 22.7% which comprised 
electrical infrastructure, engineering management and others. The financial aspect 
takes 8.3% of the capital expenditure, which is basically on contingencies and finan￾cial construction. The component level for the LCOE for the land-based wind farm 
FIGURE 12.6 Capital expenditure for offshore-based reference wind farm power project [17].
FIGURE 12.7 Component-level LCOE contribution for the 2019 offshore-based-wind farm 
reference project operating for 25 years [17].DFIG and PMSG Wind Turbines Life Cycle Cost Analysis 209
project in Figure 12.5 reflects that O&M has a larger share with 31.4%, and 23.3% 
for the nacelle. The turbine system is having the highest LCOE with 47.3%, com￾pared to the balance of system, O&M and soft cost.
On the other hand, the capital expenditure for the offshore-based wind farm proj￾ect in Figure 12.6 reflects that the balance of the system is holding the largest share 
of 52.3%, compared to the turbine system share of 31.9% and soft cost of 15.8%. 
However, the balance of the system and the O&M cost hold the same share of 34.3%, 
which is the largest share for the component level LCOE for the offshore-based wind 
farm projects in Figure 12.7.
Figure 12.8 shows the wind turbine cost decomposition of various sub-classes of 
cost expenditures. Figure 12.8 includes the entire cost of manufacturing, to build and 
deliver a typical wind turbine to a wind farm [20], as can be likened to DFIG and 
PMSG wind turbines. The manufacturing cost seems to be high since it is comprised 
of the materials to be used for the wind turbines, energy, labor, capital depreciation, 
delivery cost, legal financial aspects of the wind turbines, Research and Development 
(R&D) phase, supplier and others. Furthermore, the turbine delivery cost consists of 
two aspects: turbine distribution and turbine installation. All wind farm developers 
and policy makers follow the outlines of Figure 12.8.
12.5 CHAPTER CONCLUSION
In this chapter, some of the LCC strategies that could be applied to DFIG and PMSG 
wind turbines, for effective-cost reduction, were presented. The fundamental and 
theoretical background of LCC were discussed with regard to reliability, availability 
and downtime. The chapter also tackled O&M cost that may arise in the course of 
operation of these wind turbines considering to avoid FMEA. A typical LCC analysis 
that could be linked to DFIG and PMSG wind turbines in order to reduce production 
losses and enhance PM and CM was also reported. Furthermore, an LCOE for both

land and offshore wind farm projects using a case study was also reported in this 
chapter. Finally, a typical wind turbine cost decomposition from manufacturing to 
delivery was also presented.
PERSPECTIVE
The technology of variable speed wind turbines is very promising in renewable 
power generation. It is imperative for wind turbines to gain control after grid distur￾bances and contribute to the stability of power grids, as part of the requirements of 
grid codes set by grid operators in operating wind farms. The Doubly Fed Induction 
Generator (DFIG) and the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) are 
the two most commonly used variable speed wind turbines in modern wind farms. 
However, both wind turbines are affected during transient state, when there is distur￾bance in the grid. A better terminology for this grid disturbance is known as the Low 
Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) or Fault Ride Through (FRT) capabilities of the wind 
turbines. Many suggestions were given in the literature to solve the LVRT or FRT 
issues for both wind turbines.
Fault Current Limiters (FCLs) are capable of augmenting the performance of 
wind turbines during grid disturbances. In this book, the augmentation of the DFIG 
and the PMSG wind turbines was robustly studied, considering various levels and 
topologies of operation, using FCLs. The considered FCLs were the Series Dynamic 
Braking Resistor (SDBR), Bridge Fault Current Limiter (BFCL) and the Capacitive 
Bridge Fault Current Limiter (CBFCL). The wind turbines were operated under the 
same conditions. Both wind turbines were affected by the connection of the FCLs in 
their stators during severe grid disturbance. However, the influence of the FCLs was 
more observed in the PMSG wind turbine compared to the DFIG wind turbine. This 
is due to the fact that the PMSG wind turbine technology enables the decoupling of 
its full back-to-back power converters at the power grid.
Some other FRT strategies like super capacitor system for the DFIG and the 
effects of the machine parameters for both DFIG and PMSG were also studied in this 
book. Efforts were made to use only the effective values of the machine parameters 
and FCLs in the evaluation of the system. In addition, the cost analysis of both wind 
turbines was reported, considering a case study for practical realization.
It could be concluded that, while the DFIG wind turbine is cheaper and widely 
used in wind farms development and wind power applications, the PMSG performs 
better during transient state due to the technology of fully decoupling its active and 
reactive power in the power network, since it is fully rated. Therefore, it is recom￾mended to use FCLs with DFIG- or PMSG-based variable speed wind turbine to get 
superior LVRT or FRT performance, based on the intended purpose of the power grid 
operator or energy policy makers.
