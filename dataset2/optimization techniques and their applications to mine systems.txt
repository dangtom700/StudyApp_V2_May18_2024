Preface
Mining is one of the oldest industries and was discovered almost 20,000 years ago. Today, the mining 
industry generates more than US$700 bn revenue worldwide, only by the top 40 mining companies. 
Although mining companies are generating a significant amount of revenue, the net profit margin 
decreased from 25 per cent in 2010 to 10 per cent in 2018. As time passes, mining is becoming 
more challenging due to greater depth, low-grade, limited resources, and complex geo-mining 
conditions. Therefore, mine system optimization will play an important role in maximizing profit 
by satisfying several constraints. Moreover, today’s mining industry uses complex and sophisticated 
systems whose reliability has become a critical issue. A significant amount of research is going on 
around the globe to address these challenges; however, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there 
is no single book available that covers system engineering and optimization from mining industry 
prospects. Students, researchers, and engineers need to consult with multiple sources to find reli￾able information related to this subject that causes serious difficulty. This book combines different 
systems engineering and optimization concepts in the light of mining engineering to make a one￾stop-shop for all information seekers. This book covers almost every aspect of systems engineering 
and optimizations and is presented so that the readers don’t require previous knowledge about the 
subject to understand the contents. The book describes the fundamentals and theoretical concepts 
of optimization algorithms and their potential applications and implementation strategies in mines. 
This book includes chapters on the basics of systems engineering, linear programming, and integer 
linear programming and their applications in mines, transportation and assignment algorithms, 
network analysis, dynamic programming, queuing theory and its applications to mine systems, reli￾ability analysis of mine systems, inventory management in mines, and applications of non-linear 
optimization in mines. The book contains example problems and their solutions, and at the end of 
each chapter, there are various problems to provide readers the opportunity to comprehend their 
knowledge and understanding about the topics. A wide-ranging list of references is provided to give 
readers a view of developments in the area over the years. The book is composed of 11 chapters.
This book will be valuable to many individuals, including graduate and undergraduate students, 
researchers, academicians in mining engineering, mining engineering professionals, and associated 
professionals concerned with mining equipment.
We have a tremendous debt of gratitude to many individuals and organizations, especially to 
those companies around the globe who have shared their data to use in this book. The quality of this 
book is also substantially improved from the reviewers’ suggestions (Julian M. Ortiz of Queen’s 
University, Mustafa Kumral of McGill University, Victor Octavio Tenorio of the University of 
Arizona) and my colleagues in academia and industry.xiixiii

1 Introduction to mine systems
1.1 DEFINITION OF A SYSTEM
A system can be defined as a device or scheme that accepts single or multiple inputs and provides 
single or multiple outputs. According to Dooge (1973), a system is ‘any structure, device, scheme, 
or procedure, real or abstract, that interrelates an input and output or cause and effect or any other 
things/information in a given time reference’. Systems theory views the mines as a complex system 
of interconnected subsystems. A mining system can be classified as an open system or a closed 
system depending on the demarcation and definition of the boundary. Depending on the demarca￾tion of the boundary, one can check which entities are inside the system and which are outside. In an 
open system, materials/mass and energy both can flow through the boundary of the system; whereas, 
in a closed system, energy can flow through the boundary of the system, but materials/mass remain 
fixed and cannot flow through the boundary of the system. One can make a simplified representation 
of the mine systems in order to understand it and predict its future behaviour. A typical example of 
a mining system is represented in Figure 1.1.
1.2 TYPES OF SYSTEM
Any system can be defined or classified in multiple ways. These are as follows:
• Simple and Complex Systems: If the input has a direct relation with the output, the system 
is said to be a simple system. It may be linear or non-linear in nature.
On the other hand, a complex system is a combination of several simple systems. All these 
simple systems can be termed a sub-system. Each subsystem has a distinct relation between 
input and output. It may be linear or non-linear in nature.
Typical examples of a simple and a complex system are presented here.
Example of a simple system
y a = x1 1
FIGURE 1.1 A typical example of a mining system (mine as an open system).2 Optimization techniques and their applications
2
Example of a complex system
y a x a x a xn n = + + 1 1 2 2 
• = y y + + y y 1 2  n
where y is the output from the system, x x x 1 2 n ,,, … are inputs to the system, and a a a 1 2 n , ,…,
are weights associated with the inputs. Both the above simple and complex systems are 
linear. In the simple system, the output is directly proportional to the input, but the same 
does not hold true for the complex system. Thus, the complex system represents n number 
of sub-systems or simple systems.
• Linear and Nonlinear Systems: A linear system is a type of system in which the output from 
the system varies directly with respect to the inputs of the system. Also, a linear system satis￾fies superposition and homogenate principles. In a linear system, the output of a combination 
of inputs is equal to the sum of the outputs from each of the individual inputs.
For example, the inputs of two systems are x t 1 ( ) and x t 2 ( ), and the corresponding outputs are respect￾ively y t 1 ( ) and y t 2 ( ). Then, for a linear system, superposition and homogenate principles will hold 
good, and mathematically, this can be represented as:
f a x t a x t a f x t a f x t 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2  ( ) + ( )  
 =  ( )  
 +  ( )  
 = a y t a y t 1 1 2 2 ( ) + ( )
It is evident from the above relationship that the output of the overall system is equal to the output 
of the individual system.
On the other hand, if the condition of superposition and homogenate principles is not satisfied, 
then the system is called a non-linear system. That is, in a non-linear system, the above equation 
does not hold.
f a x t a x t a f x t a f x t 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2  ( ) + ( )  
 ≠  ( )  
 +  ( )  

f a x t a x t a y t a y t 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2  ( ) + ( )  
 ≠ ( ) + ( )
• Time-Variant and Time-Invariant Systems: If any time shifts in the input in the system 
cause the same amount of time shift in the output, the system is said to be a time-invariant 
system.
If the above condition is not satisfied, the system is said to be a time-variant system
Example of a time-invariant system
y t( ) = +k x (t)
where y t( ) is output and x t( ) is input of the system. k is any constant.
Let there is delay input by ∆t and output is y t 1 ( )
We have, y t k x t t 1 ( ) = + ( − ∆ )
Again, assuming for the delay in output by ∆t and output is y t 2 ( )
We have, y t y t t k x t t 2 ( ) = − ( ∆ ) = + ( − ∆ )Introduction to mine systems 3

Therefore, the above two equations indicate that
y t y t 1 2 ( ) = ( )
Thus, the above system is a time-invariant system.
Example of a time-variant system
y t( ) = tx (t)
Let there is delay input by ∆t and output is y t 1 ( )
We have, y t tx t t 1 ( ) = − ( ∆ )
Again, assuming for the delay in output by ∆t and output is y t 2 ( )
We have, y t y t t t t x t t 2 ( ) = − ( ∆ ) = − ( ∆ ) ( − ∆ )
Therefore, the above two equations indicate that
y t y t 1 2 ( ) ≠ ( )
Thus, the above system is a time-variant system.
• Continuous and discrete changes systems: A system is said to be continuous if the variable(s) 
are subjected to change continuously over time.
On the other hand, if the variable(s) are subjected to change at a discrete interval of time.
For example, a system in mine showing the number of dump trucks waiting in the queue for 
being loaded is a discrete number. That is, for any moment, the number of dump trucks is an integer 
number.
On the other hand, the strata pressure on the roof is continuous in nature. That is, every moment, 
the pressure is subjected to change.
The graphical representation of the characteristics of the discrete and continuous data is shown 
in Figure 1.2.
FIGURE 1.2 Discrete vs. continuous system.4 Optimization techniques and their applications

• Lumped Parameter and Distributed Parameter Systems: If the dependent variables are a 
function of time alone and the variation in space is either non-existent or ignored, the system 
is said to be a lumped parameter system. This type of system can be represented by ordinary 
differential equations.
On the other hand, if all the dependent variables are functions of time and at least one variable 
has spatial variation, then the system is said to be a distributed parameter system. This type of 
system is governed by a partial differential equation.
• Static and Dynamic Systems: If the output of the system doesn’t depend on the time￾dependent input variable, the system is said to be a static system. But, if the output of the 
system depends on the time-dependent input, then the system is said to be a dynamic system. 
A static system has memory-less property, but the dynamic system does not have the same.
Example of a static system: y t( ) = c x (t).
At t = 0, the output of the system is given by
y c (0 0 ) = * x ( )
It is clear that the output depends on the current input only, and hence the system represents a 
static, memory-less property.
Example of a dynamic system: y t( ) = c x (t c ) + − x t( n) 1 2 .
At t = 0, the output of the system is given by
y c 0 0 x c x n 1 2 ( ) = ( ) + −( )
In the above equation, x n (− ) represents the past value for the current input, and thus the system 
needs memory to get this current output. This type of system is called a dynamic system.
• Deterministic and Probabilistic Systems: If the occurrence of all events is known with com￾plete certainty, the system is said to be a deterministic system. In a deterministic system, the 
output remains the same for constant input.
But, if the occurrence of an event cannot be perfectly known, the system is said to be probabil￾istic. In a probabilistic system, the output may not be constant for the same input, and thus the input￾output relationship in this type of system is probabilistic in nature.
For example, the failure time of a mining machine is probabilistic, but the capacity of the same 
machine is deterministic.
1.3 SYSTEM APPROACH
In any mining system, the relationship between the input–output is controlled by multiple factors 
like the characteristic of the deposit (shape, size, depth, and strength), mining method, type of 
machinery, workforce, etc., and the physical laws governing the system. In many of the mining 
systems, the characteristics of the deposit and the laws governing the system are very complex. Thus 
modelling of those complex systems requires considering simplifying assumptions and transform￾ation functions to determine the output corresponding to input. The system analysis process requires 
defining and formulation of the system by constructing a mathematical model, wherein the input￾output relationships are estimated through existing operating conditions of the system.
In general, the objective of the system approach is to break down a complex system into multiple 
simple sub-systems for a better understanding of the different components of the complex system. 
Most of the mining systems are open as most of the sub-systems are linked to each other. To analyse 
and understand a mining system, it needs to be identified the different sub-systems by defining the 
boundaries.Introduction to mine systems 5

The system approach should focus on the common objects of the system without neglecting the 
sub-systems. Major characteristics of a system approach are:
1. Holism: It tells that a change in any sub-system of a system directly or indirectly affects 
the entire properties of the system (Boulding, 1985; Litterer, 1973; von Bertalanffy, 1968).
2. Specialization: The entire system can be divided into different subsystems for easy 
understanding of the typical role of each sub-system in the system.
3. Non-summation: Every subsystem is of importance to the entire system, and hence it is of 
utmost importance to understand the role of individual sub-systems to get the complete per￾spective of the system (Boulding, 1985; Litterer, 1973).
4. Grouping: The process of grouping may lead to its own complexity by more specialized 
sub-systems. Therefore, it is desired to make a group with related disciplines or 
sub-disciplines.
5. Coordination: The grouped components in a sub-system need coordination and control 
in the study of systems. It is difficult to maintain a unified, holistic concept without proper 
coordination.
6. Emergent properties: This property tells that the group of interrelated components has a 
common property instead of properties of any individual component. This is the general 
view of a system.
1.4 SYSTEM ANALYSIS
System analysis is a process of collecting information, identifying problems, and decomposing a 
system into smaller sub-systems. It is usually done using a standard optimization technique based 
on the formulated mathematical equations. It should be noted that systems analysis is not simply 
to solve a mathematical model but requires decision-making for designing a system. The system 
analysis techniques can be used for solving both descriptive and prescriptive models. A descriptive 
model explains how a system works; whereas, a prescriptive model offers a solution for optimal 
operation of the system for achieving the desired objectives.
1.5 ELEMENTS OF A MINING SYSTEM
The elements of a mining system are represented in a diagram, as shown in Figure 1.3.
FIGURE 1.3 Elements of a mining system.6 Optimization techniques and their applications

• Inputs and outputs
The main objective of a mining system is to maximize (or minimize) outputs from the system 
for a given input. The inputs to a typical mining system are workforce, heavy earth moving 
machinery, explosives, supports, transportation equipment, etc. The outputs of any mining 
system are production, productivity, quality, accident and incident rates, etc.
• Production operation
The production operation in a mining system involves the actual transformation of input (in￾situ coal or ore) to output (extracted coal or mineral) for supplying to the consumer. The pro￾duction process involves many operations like drilling and blasting, loading into dump trucks/
haul trucks or conveyor belts, transportation, etc. Therefore, the operational process needs to 
modify by changing the input either totally or partially, depending on the desired productions.
• Control management
The control management guides the mining system by analysing the pattern of activities 
governing input, operations, and output. The decision-making played a significant role in opti￾mizing the productions operations based on the available resources and desired outputs. The 
production behaviour of a mining system is controlled by the operational process. To optimize 
the system, management should know how much input is needed to obtain the desired output.
• Feedback
Feedback of the production process requires decision-making on the system’s alteration to 
achieve the desired output. Positive feedback is routine that encourages the performance of 
the system; whereas, negative feedback provides the information to management for action.
• Environment
The output of the system depends on the environment facilitates the mining systems. It 
includes any external factors like political interference and market conditions that affect the 
actual performance of the system.
• Boundaries and interface
Each system has boundaries that determine its periphery of influence and control. Boundaries 
are the limits that identify its sub-system, processes, and interrelationship among them. Thus, 
the definition of the boundaries of any mining system is crucial in determining the nature of 
its interface with other systems for successful design.
1.6 DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM
Optimization is a process of searching for the most cost-effective or most efficient solution of any 
system or sub-systems under the given constraints of any defined problem by maximizing desired 
factors and minimizing undesired ones. In other words, optimization problems are represented 
by a mathematical equation of the objective function and constraints, and decision variables are 
estimated based on a formal search procedure for optimizing the objective function. An optimization 
problem can be classified in multiple ways like the nature of constraints, characteristics of decision 
variables, type of equations used, and several objective functions. A brief description of the classi￾fication is given below.
1.6.1 Based on the existence of constraints
• Constrained optimization problem: Any problem is said to be a constrained optimization 
problem if it has one or more constraints. The generalized form of a constrained optimization 
problem is shown below:Introduction to mine systems 7

In the above optimization problem, Z is called the objective function that needs to be optimized. The 
variables x x x 1 2 m ,,, … are called decision variables. The decision variables are subject to n number 
of constraints along with the non-negativity constraints. The value of pk can be any real number.
• Unconstrained optimization problem: Any problem is said to be an unconstrained optimiza￾tion problem if it has no constraints. The generalized form of an unconstrained optimization 
problem is shown below:

In the above optimization problem, Z is called the objective function that needs to be optimized. The 
variables xi are called decision variables. The decision variables are not subjected to any constraints. 
The value of pk
 can be any real number.
1.6.2 Based on the nature of the equations involved
• Linear programming problem (LPP): If the objective function and all the constraints of 
a problem are linear, then the problem is said to be a linear programming problem (LPP). It 
is probably the single-most applied optimization technique in engineering decision-making. 
Thus, the generalized form of the LPP is

If the decision variables are restricted to integer values, the same problem represents an integer￾programming problem.
• Quadratic programming problem: In a quadratic programming problem, the objective 
function is a quadratic function, and all constraint functions are linear. The general form of a 
quadratic problem is as follows:
Maximize M( inimize)Z q = +x x Qx T T 1
28 Optimization techniques and their applications
8
Subject to Ax = a
Bx ≤ b
x ≥ 0
The objective function is arranged such that the vector q contains all of the (single-differentiated) 
linear terms and Q contains all of the (twice-differentiated) quadratic terms. The constants contained 
in the objective function are left out of the general formulation.
As for the constraints, the matrix equation Ax = a contains all of the linear equality constraints, 
and Bx ≤ b are the linear inequality constraints.
• Non-linear programming problem: In non-linear programming problem, the objective 
function and/or one or more constraints are non-linear. An unconstrained problem can be 
represented as a non-linear programming problem if at least one of the values of pk is not 
equal to 1.
1.6.3 Based on the permissible values of the decision variables
• Integer programming problem: Integer programming, which is a variant of LPP, the deci￾sion variables are integer. It is a special case of LPP in which all the decision variables are 
restricted to take only integer (or discrete) values. The general form of an integer program￾ming problem is given by

If some of the variables are integer values and the remaining are real values, the problem is a 
mixed integer programming problem. The binary programming problem is a special case of an 
integer programming problem, where decision variables are all binary, that is, 0 or 1.
1.6.4 Based on the number of the objective function
• Single-objective problem: If the optimization problem has only one objective function, then 
the problem is said to be a single-objective problem.
• Multi-objective problem: If the optimization problem has more than one objective function, 
then the problem is said to be a multi-objective problem.
The mathematical form of a multi-objective problem can be represented as follows:
Minimize f x fx fx 1 2 k ( ), , ( ) …, ( )
Subject to g x , , j m , , j ( ) ≤ = 0 1 2 …
In the given problem, the objective functions, f x f x f x 1 2 k ( ), , ( ) …, ( ) need to be minimized simul￾taneously. The problem has m number of constraints.Introduction to mine systems 9

1.7 SOLVING OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
In the last few decades, many algorithms have been developed for solving different types of opti￾mization problems. The selection of a suitable algorithm for solving an optimization problem 
depends on the nature of the problem. The major advancement in optimization happened after the 
development of digital computers. Currently, many options are available to solve complex optimiza￾tion problems. A few techniques are explained below.
1.7.1  Classical optimization techniques
The classical optimization techniques are useful for solving constrained and unconstrained single￾and multi-variable optimization problems that involve continuous and differentiable functions. The 
followings are the few popular classical optimization techniques.
1.7.1.1 Direct methods
Direct methods are the simple searching approach to obtain the optimum solution. These methods do 
not require any derivatives at any points for finding the optimal solution. The golden-section search 
(Press et al., 2007) can be used to solve the one-dimensional problem, whereas univariate search or 
random search method (Rastrigin, 1963) can be used for solving multi-dimensional problems.
1.7.1.2 Gradient methods
In the gradient method, the derivative information of the optimization function is used to locate the 
solution. The first derivatives of the function offer slopes of the function that become zero at the 
optimal point. The steepest slope or gradient of the function tells the optimal solution. For a one￾dimensional problem, Newton’s method (Avriel, 2003) can be used to find the optimum solution of 
the function.
1.7.1.3 Linear programming methods
In this method, linear mathematical functions are formulated to represent both the objective 
functions and constraints to derive the optimal solution. For single and two-variable linear program￾ming problems, the graphical solution method can be used. For more than two variable problems, 
the simplex method (Murty, 1983) can be used to determine the optimal solution.
1.7.1.4 Interior point method
Interior point method (IPM), also referred to as barrier method, is generally used to solve linear 
and nonlinear convex optimization problems. The method was first proposed by Soviet mathemat￾ician Dikin in 1967 and reinvented in the USA in the mid-1980s. In this method, the violations of 
inequality constraints are prevented by shifting the objective function with a barrier term that causes 
the optimal unconstrained value to be in the feasible space.
1.7.2  Advanced optimization techniques
Most of the real mining optimization problems involve complexities like a large number of variables, 
non-linearity, and multiple conflicting objectives. Furthermore, it is difficult to find the global 
optimum solution due to the large search space. In general, if the system cannot be solved using 
the classical optimization solving methods, the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can be used. EAs are 
applied to a large-scale optimization problem for obtaining near-optimum solutions. This type of 
algorithm can be easily applied to an optimization problem with many decision variables and non￾linear objective functions and constraints.10 Optimization techniques and their applications
10
Goldberg (1989) has developed the first evolutionary optimization technique, called a genetic 
algorithm (GA). GA algorithm was designed based on the Darwinian principle ‘the survival of the 
fittest and the natural process of evolution through reproduction’. In the last few decades, many 
other evolutionary algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (Eberhart and Kennedy, 
1995), estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) (Pelikan, 2005), Tabu search (Glover, 1986), Ant 
Colony (Colorni et al., 1991), etc., have been developed.
In this type of algorithm, the solving process starts from a population of possible random solutions 
and moved towards the optimal by incorporating generation and selection.11

2 Basics of probability and 
statistics
2.1 DEFINITION OF PROBABILITY
Probability is defined as the chances of occurrence of any event in an experiment. The sum of all 
the possible outcomes is called the sample space, and a subset of sample space is known as an 
event.
If there are S exhaustive (i.e., at least one of the events must occur), mutually exclusive (i.e., only 
one event occurs at a time), and equally likely outcomes of a random experiment (i.e., equal chances 
of occurrence of each event) and r of them are favourable to the occurrence of an event A, the prob￾ability of the occurrence of the event A is given by
P A r
S ( ) = (2.1)
It is sometimes expressed as ‘odds in favour of A’ or the ‘odds against A’. The ‘odds in favour of 
A’ is defined as the ratio of occurrence of event A to the non-occurrence of event A. On the other 
hand, ‘odds against A’ is defined as the ratio of non-occurrence of event A to the occurrence of 
event A
Oddsin favour of A Probability of occurrence of event

Again,

/
The total probability of the occurrence of any event ranges from 0 to 1.
i.e.,0≤ P A( ) ≤1
P A( ) = 0 indicates event A is impossible, and P A( ) = 1 indicates the event is certain.
In the above discussion, the discrete sample space was considered. But, the probability can also 
be determined for a continuous sample space. For a continuous sample space, the probability of 
occurrence is measured as a probability density function. The probability density function of 
any continuous random variable gives the relative likelihood of any outcome in a specific range. 
Therefore, for a continuous random variable, the probability of an outcome of any single or discrete 
outcome is zero.
Example 2.1: Two detonators are picked at random from a detonator box that has 12 detonators, 
of which four are defective. Determine the probability that both the detonators have chosen are 
defective.12 Optimization techniques and their applications
12
Solution: Let A be the event of picking two defective detonators.
The probability of occurrence of event A is given by
P A( ) = Number of waysof selection defective detonators out of

where 4 2 C represents the number of ways two items can be picked from four items at a time, and 
12 2 C represents the number of ways two items can be picked from 12 items at a time.
The probability of occurrence of event A is 0.09. Therefore, the probability of the event that both 
the picked detonators are defective is 0.09.
Example 2.2: From open-pit coal mine, 500 workers were randomly chosen. It was found that 30 
workers experienced an injury in the year 2020. The distribution of injury, based on the younger 
age group (age ≤ 35 years) and older age group ( ) age > 35 years , generates the following cross￾classification table.
Age group
Number of workers
Injured Non-Injured Row total
Younger age group 10 120 130
Older age group 20 350 370
Column total 30 470 500
Determine the odds of injury for the younger age group compared to the older age group.
Solution
We have,
Number of workers injured in younger age group = NYI = 10
Number of workers non-injured in younger age group = NYNI = 120
Number of workers injured in older age group = NOI = 20
Number of workers non-injured in older age group = NONI = 350

2.2 ADDITIONAL THEORY OF PROBABILITY
If two events A and B are mutually exclusive, the probability of occurrence of either A or B is 
given by
P A( ∪ B P ) = (A P ) + (B) (2.2)
where P A( ) is the probability of even A and P B( ) is the probability of event B.
If events A and B are not mutually exclusive, then
P A( ∪ B P ) = (A P ) + (B P ) – (A B ∩ ) (2.3)
P A( ∩ B) represents the probability of occurrence of both events simultaneously.
For n number of mutually exclusive events A A, , , A 1 2 … n ( ), the probability of occurrence of either 
of the A A A 1 2 n , ,…, events can be presented as:
P A A A PA PA PA 1 2 ∪ ∪ ∪ n n 1 2 ( )   = ( ) + ( ) + = ( ) (2.4)
In the case of three non-mutually exclusive events:
P A( ∪ ∪B C) = P A( ) + P B( ) + P C( ) – P A( ∩ B P ) − ∩ (B C) − ∩ P A( C P ) + ∩ (A B ∩C) (2.5)
where
 P A( ) = probability of occurring the event A
P B( ) = probability of occurring the event B
P C( ) = probability of occurring the event C
P A( ∩ B)= probability of occurring both the events A and B simultaneously
P B( ∩C) = probability of occurring both the events C and B simultaneously
P A( ∩C) = probability of occurring both the events A and C simultaneously
P A( ∩ ∩B C) = probability of occurring all the three events A, B, and C simultaneously
Example 2.3: The probability of failure of a dump truck A is 0.7, and that of dump truck B is 0.2. 
If the probability of failure of both the dump trucks is 0.3 simultaneously, determine the probability 
that neither of the dump trucks fails.
Solution
We have,
Probability of failure of a dumper . A P = (A) = 0 7
Probability of failure of a dumper . B P = (B) = 0 2
Probability of failure of both the dump trucks Aand B = ∩ P A( B) = 0 3.
Probability of failure of either of the dump trucks Aor B = ∩ P A( B P ) = (A) + P B( ) – P A( ∩ B)
⇒ ∩ P A( B) = + 07 02 03 . . − = . . 0 6
The probability that neither of the dump trucksfails = ∩ P A( ) B P = −1 (A∩ B) = −1 0. . 6 0 = 4
Therefore, the probability that neither the dump truck fails is 0.4.14 Optimization techniques and their applications

2.3 PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS
The probability distribution for a discrete random variable is referred to as the probability mass 
function (PMF); whereas, the same is referred to as probability density function (PDF) for the con￾tinuous random variable. A PMF, P X( ) or PDF, f x( ) must be non-negative, and the sum of the prob￾ability of the entire sample space must be equal to 1. The probability distribution can be represented 
by a discrete or continuous function, as explained in subsequent subsections.
The probability distribution for a discrete random variable is represented by spikes of probability 
values correspond to the random variable.
An important probability measure is the cumulative distribution function (CDF). The CDF of a 
discrete random variable, F k X( ) represents the probability that the random variable X is less than or 
equal to k. It can be represented mathematically, as
P X k F k P x X

For example, a mine worker takes leave randomly on any one day of the week. The probabilities of 
taking the leave each day are given in Table 2.1. The probability of taking the leave on Sunday and 
Saturday are 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. For the rest of the days, the probability of taking leave is 0.1. 
The spikes of PMF and CDF for the given data (Table 2.1) are shown in Figures 2.1(a) and 2.1(b), 
respectively. The CDF values can be directly determined from the PMF values by cumulating the 
values. The CDF and PMF values for the first day of the week (Monday) are the same. In the subse￾quent days, the CDF values are calculated by taking the sum of the current day PMF value and the 
previous day’s CDF value. The CDF value for the last day is 1 [Figure 2.1(b)], which is equal to the 
sum of the PMF for each day.
On the other hand, the probability distribution of a continuous random variable is represented 
by smooth curves, as shown in Figure 2.2(a). The CDF of a continuous random variable is a non￾decreasing function with a maximum value of 1, as shown in Figure 2.2(b). Mathematically, it can 
be represented as

where f(x) is a probability density function of a continuous random variable, X. F k X ( ) represents the 
cumulative distribution function for the random variable X k ≤ , which is measured by the ordinate 
of the probability curve.
The shaded area of Figure 2.2(a) represents the probability that X k ≤ . It is also represented 
by CDF value, F k X ( ) [Figure 2(b)]. The total probability for any PDF is equal to 1, as shown in 
Eq. (2.1), and can be presented as:

A uniform distribution, also called a rectangular distribution, is a distribution that has a constant 
probability, as shown in Figure 2.3(c). The nature of the CDF of a uniform distribution function is 
shown in Figure 2.3(d). The CDF of uniform distribution is a straight line that intercepts the x-axis 
at a value a, and it has a slope of 1
b a − .
Example 2.4: The daily explosives demand in an opencast mine is uniformly distributed between 
2500 and 3250 kg. The explosive tank, which has a storage capacity of 3000 kg, is refilled daily 
after the end of the last shift. What is the probability that the tank will be empty before the end of 
the last shift?
Solution
For uniform distribution of demand in the range of a (=2550) to b (=3250), the probability density 
function can be represented as
f x( ) = − = − = 1 1

Example 2.5: The daily coal production from a mine follows a continuous uniform distribution with 
a range [3000, 3500] tons. Find the probability that the production in a randomly selected day has

Example 2.6: A mine worker arrives at pit-bottom at a random time (i.e., no prior knowledge of the 
scheduled start time) to ride on the cage on the next trip. Cage starts at pit-bottom every 10 minutes 
without fail, and hence the next trip will start any time during the next 10 minutes with evenly 
distributed probability (a uniform distribution). Find the probability that the cage will start within 
the next 5 minutes after the arrival of the worker at the pit bottom.
Solution
The probability density function (Figure 2.4) represents a horizontal line above the interval from 
0 to 10 minutes for a uniform distribution. As the total probability is one, the total area under the 
curve must be one, and hence the height of the horizontal line is 1/10 with the bin size of 1 minute.
The probability that the cage will start within the next 5 minutes after the arrival of the worker 
at the pit-bottom is P X (0 5 ≤ ≤ ). This represents the shaded region in Figure 2.4. Its area is, 
(5)*(1/10) =1/2.
Thus, the probability that the cage will start within the next 5 minutes after the arrival of the 
worker at the pit bottom is

2.4.2  Normal distribution
Although many distribution functions are developed and applied for different purposes, the Gaussian 
distribution, also known as the normal distribution, is the most widely used distribution function 
across all disciplines. The probability density function of the normal distribution is given by

The nature of the PDF for a normal distribution function is shown in Figure 2.5. The PDF of the 
normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve and is symmetric around mean µ. Therefore, the prob￾ability of both the right-hand and left-hand sides of mean µ is equal, and that is 0.5.
A normal distribution with arbitrary data range can be converted into a standardized normal 
density by putting 
x
z ( − ) = µ
σ
, which referred to z-score or standard score. Taking derivative of 
x
z ( − ) = µ
σ
 with respect to z, we get dz d = x /σ. Thus, Eq. 2.11 can be rewritten as

In the normalized PDF, µ = 0 and σ = 1, as shown in Figure 2.6. The CDF of a standardized normal

The peak of the curve (at the mean) in a normalized PDF of the normal distribution function is 
approximately 0.399.
Furthermore, the distribution can easily be normalized to adapt to the particular mean and 
standard deviation of interest. It can be demonstrated using the probability, P X( ≤ b), written as

We can transform any data that follows a normal distribution to a standardized normal distribution. 
This transformation will help to determine the probabilities for any normally distributed data using 
the standardized normal distribution (Table 2.2) without any application of integral calculus. The 
beauty of normal distribution is that we can easily calculate the probability within a specific range 
by knowing the standard deviation value. For example, if the mean is μ and the standard deviation 
is σ, then about 68% of the values lie within μ ± σ, and 95% of values lie within μ ± 2σ in a normal 
distribution, as shown in Figure 2.8.

The probability value of a normally distributed function can be calculated from the standardized 
normal distribution. The label for rows contains the integer part and the first decimal place of z. The 
label for columns contains the second decimal place of z. The values within the table are the prob￾abilities corresponding to the different z-value. These probabilities are calculations of the area under 
the normal curve from the starting point (negative infinity) to a specified value with the maximum 
up to positive infinity.
For example, to find the value for z ≤ 0 7. 2, the value corresponding to the row with 0.7 and the 
column with 0.02 gives a probability of 0.7611 for a cumulative from −∞. Thus, four different cases 
can be observed when the z-score value is used for probability calculation.
Case 1: P z( ) ≤ a
The probability of z is less than any specific positive value ‘ a ’ can be determined using the standard 
normal distribution table data, as given in Table 2.2. This is generally represented as Φ.

Therefore, for any positive value, a , the probability of z less than acan be determined as
P z( ≤ a a ) = φ(a f ) or 0 >
Graphically, this can be represented as shown in Figure 2.9. The shaded region (Figure 2.9) 
represents the probability of z less and equal to a.
Case 2: P z( ) ≤ − a
Since the standard normal distribution table only provides the probability for values less than a 
positive z-value (i.e., z-values on the right-hand side of the mean), the probability for z less than a 
negative value can be determined using an indirect method. The standard normal distribution has 
a total area (probability) equal to 1, and it is also symmetrical around the mean. Thus, the probability 
for z a ≤ − [Figure 2.10(a)] will be the same as the probability of z a > [Figure 2.10(b)]. The prob￾ability of z a ≤ is shown in Figure 2.10(c).

Solution
Given data:
Mean grade of the random sample (x) = 68%

probability that the random samples are taken from the same iron ore mine is 0.9697.
2.4.3  Poisson distribution
Poisson distribution, a discrete probability distribution, tells the number of occurrences of a spe￾cific event within a particular time interval. In Poisson distribution, the events occur with a known 
constant mean rate, and the time interval between two consecutive events is independent. Poisson 
distribution is a count distribution and is thus represented by a probability mass function.
The probability mass function of Poisson distribution is written as:

where
λ = mean of the number of occurrences within a specific time interval (or mean of the distribution).
x = number of occurrences of a given event.

per unit time. It can be derived as follows:

Example 2.12: Suppose the loading time of a mining machine (in minutes) follows an exponential 
distribution with a mean loading rate of 1/6 per minute. Determine the probability that the machine 
will take more than 6 minutes to complete loading.

Let X = the length of a loading time, in minutes.

2.5 CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY
Conditional probability is the probability of occurrence of one event with some relationship to 
(conditioning to) one or more other events. For two events A and B with P B( ) > 0, the conditional 
probability of A and B, P A( | B) is defined as

Example 2.13: In Example 2.6, determine the probability that the cage will start within the next 4 
minutes after the arrival of the worker at the pit-bottom if it is known that the cage has not started 
1 minute before the arrival of the worker.
Solution
Let A be the event that the cage will start within 4 minutes of arrival and B be the event that the 
cage has not started within 1 minute before the arrival of the worker. The shaded area in Figure 2.16

2.6 MEMORYLESS PROPERTY OF THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
The memoryless property indicates that a given probability distribution is independent of its his￾torical occurrences. If a probability density has the memoryless property, the chance of occurrence 
of any event in the future is independent of the occurrence of the event in the past. The exponential 
distribution is one of the probability distribution functions that has memoryless properties.
For example, the inter-arrival time between trucks in a production bench is exponentially 
distributed with a mean arrival time of T minutes. Assuming that the time elapsed since the last 
truck arrived is t (t > T) minutes. Since a significant length of time has now elapsed, there is a high 
chance that a truck will arrive within the next minute. But for the exponential distribution, this does 
not hold true. The additional time spent waiting for the next truck to arrive does not depend on the 
time that has already elapsed since the last truck arrived. This is referred to as the memoryless prop￾erty. Specifically, the memoryless property says that
P X T t X T P X t

Example 2.14: The time a shovel takes to load a truck follows an exponential distribution with a 
mean of four minutes. If the truck has already spent four minutes in a queue before loading, deter￾mine the probability that the truck will spend at least an additional three minutes for completion of 
the loading operation?
Solution
Mean loading time (λ) = 4 minutes.
P X t e e t t ( < ) = − ( ) = − − − 1 1 λ 0 2. 5
The probability that the truck will spend at least an additional three minutes with the shovel, which 
already spent 4 minutes, is given by

years) it works until it breaks down, satisfies the following probability density function.
P T t e t t ( ≥ ) = ≥ − / , 5 0
If the dragline successfully works more than or equal to 2 years, determine the probability of 
breaking down in the third year.
Solution: Let A be the event that the dragline breakdown in the third year and B be the event that the 
dragline does not break down in the first two years.

2.7 THEOREM OF TOTAL PROBABILITY FOR COMPOUND EVENTS
Let events A A A 1 2 n , ..., , , form partitions of the sample space S, where all the events have a non-zero 
probability of occurrence. For any event, A associated with S, according to the total probability 
theorem,

Proof:
The collection of events A A A 1 2 n , ,…, are said to partition a sample space S (Figure 2.17) if the 
following conditions hold.
a. A A A S 1 2 ∪ ∪…∪ n =
b. A A i j to n i j i j ∩ = φ , , ∈ ≠ 1 and
c. A i to n i ≠ ∈ φ 1
If A is any event within S, it can be expressed as a union of subsets as

FIGURE 2.17 Partition of sample space by n events.Basics of probability and statistics 33

The bracketed events AA AA , , , A A ∩ n ( ) ( ) ∩ … ∩ ( ) 1 2 are mutually exclusive (if one occurs, then 
none of the others can occur). Thus, from the law of probability for mutually exclusive events, 
we have

2.8 BAYES’ RULE
The most useful property of conditional probability is Bayes’ rule. If the value of conditional prob￾ability P B( |A) is known, the value of conditional probability P A( |B) can be easily determined using 
Bayes’ rule. The theorem can be derived as follows:
The conditional probability, P A( |B) for two events, A and B can be presented as:
P A B
P A B
P B ( | w ) = here P B ( ∩ )
( ) , 0 ( ) ≠
Similarly, the conditional probability P B( |A) for two events, A and B can be written as:
P B A
P B A
P A ( | w ) = here P A ( ∩ )
( ) , 0 ( ) ≠
Since the joint probabilities of two events are equal, we have
P B( ∩ A P ) = ∩ (A B)
Therefore,
P A( ∩ B P ) = ( | A B) ( P B( ) = P B | ) A P(A)

Example 2.16: Iron ore samples are collected from three mines, A, B, and C. In mine A, 60% of 
samples have grade values greater than cut-off grade, in mine B, 50% of the samples have grades 
greater than cut-off grade, and in mine C, 40% of the samples have grades greater than the cut-off 
grade. Of the total sample from three mines, 40% are from mine A, 25% from mine B, and 35% 
from mine C. Given that a particular sample has a grade greater than the cut-off grade determines 
the probability that the sample is collected from mine B.
Solution
The probability that the sample is from mine B if the grade value (G) is higher than the cut-off grade 
(CoG) is given by
P sample mine B|G CoG

2.9 DEFINITION OF STATISTICS
Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with data collection, data analysis, and interpret￾ation. Data are information, which are collected through experiment or observation. In statistics, a 
random variable or stochastic variable can be defined as a variable whose values depend on the 
outcomes of a random process (Blitzstein and Hwang, 2014). For example, the failure occurrence 
time of heavy earth-moving machinery deployed in a mine is a random variable, as the same cannot 
be estimated deterministically through an algebraic equation. As discussed before, a random vari￾able can be continuous or discrete and can be represented using probability density function and 
probability mass function.
Data can be classified based on data type and data source.
• Based on the data type:
There are two kinds of data types: quantitative and qualitative.
Quantitative data: Quantitative data is expressed in numbers. Quantitative data can be 
summarized using statistical analysis for obtaining meaningful information. Examples of 
quantitative data are daily production from mines (i.e., 50 million tonnes), depth of the 
deposit (i.e., 100 m), etc.
Qualitative Data: The data which are not measured numerically is referred to as qualitative 
data. For example, safety rating in mines (i.e., low, medium, or high), working environment 
in mines (i.e., poor or good), etc. Safety rating in mines can be referred to as low, medium, 
or high but not measured with any numeric value. Similarly, the working environment in a 
mine can be measured with a linguistic value like poor or good.Basics of probability and statistics 35
35
• Based on the data source: There are two kinds of data sources: primary and secondary.
Primary data: Primary data refers to those collected directly from objects, processes, or indi￾viduals. The primary data can be quantitative or qualitative. For example, failure time of 
mining equipment, roof convergence using extensometer, etc.
Secondary data: Secondary data refers to those which are obtained from other sources. 
For example, accident data obtained from federal agencies like Mine Safety and Health 
Administration (MSHA), USA, Director General of Mines Safety (DGMS), India is sec￾ondary data for the user.
• Based on the continuity of the data: There are two kinds of data types: discrete and 
continuous.
Discrete data: Discrete data refers to the type of quantitative data that relies on counts. 
Discrete data can take only certain values. For example, the number of persons employed in 
different mines can be characterized as discrete data (Figure 2.18).
Continuous data: Continuous data refers to the unlimited number of possible measurements 
in a specified range. For example, the daily price of dry iron ore in the International market 
can be characterized as continuous data (Figure 2.19).

2.10 STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF DATA
All quantitative data can be statistically analysed. Two main statistical methods are used in data 
analysis, viz. descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics describe the 
characteristics of data using different indices, including mean, median, standard deviation, etc.,
whereas inferential statistics allows drawing inferences about the population from that sample data.
2.10.1  Common tools of descriptive statistics
In descriptive statistics, the entire group data, which need to describe, are used to determine the 
statistics. The descriptive statistics of group data can be represented with complete certainty (out￾side of measurement error). The statistical measures commonly used in descriptive statistics are 
explained below.
2.10.1.1 Arithmetic Mean

If the distribution of the data follows a continuous function, y f = (x) on the interval [a, b], the 
mean value of the function in the defined range is given by Eq. 2.23.
Mean Value

(x f ) = x dx ( − ) ( ) ∫ 1 (2.23)
In the above equation, (b - a) represents the width under the curve, and x as the mean height of the 
curve in the range of a to b. This represents the area under the curve in an interval [a, b].

2.10.1.2 Median
Median is defined as the middle value after sorting the observation either in ascending or decreasing 
order. If the number of the observation is an odd number, say 2n+1, where n is an integer, the value 
of the (n+1)th observation gives the median value, while if the number is even, say 2n, then the 38 Optimization techniques and their applications

The ascending order of the metal production is

Therefore, the median value is 165 tonnes.

The ascending order of the production for the first 6 days’ data is

2.10.1.3 Mode
Mode represents the maximum frequency of observations. In other words, the maximum peak of a

2.10.1.4 Standard deviation
Standard deviation (σ) is the positive square root of the average of the squares of the deviations of 
the observations from the mean of the observations. It measures the dispersion of the data from the 
mean value. The standard deviation of N observations (x x x 1 2 N , , …, ) can be determined using 
Eq.2.27.

If a random variable X has x x , , , x 1 2 … N occurrences with respective frequencies s s, , ,s 1 2 … N , 
the standard deviation can be determined using Eq. 2.28.

where si
 is the frequency of the i

Standard deviation (σ) is the most commonly used measure of dispersion or overall variation 
in a data set. The low standard deviation value represents observations that are close to their mean 
value, exhibiting little variation or dispersion. On the other hand, the high standard deviation value 
represents the observation values are highly dispersed or spread out from their mean, exhibiting 
more variation. The zero (0) standard deviation means all observations are identical.
The inter-quartile range is another term that can be used to measure the variation of a dataset. In a 
dataset, the quartiles are the values that divide the data into four equal parts. The inter-quartile range 
(IQR) represents the difference between the upper quartile (median of the upper half of dataset) and 
the lower quartile (median of the lower half of the dataset).
Example 2.24: Using Example 2.17 data, determine the standard deviation of the metal production.
Solution
Given metal production data:

2.10.1.5 Mean Absolute Deviation
It is the mean of the absolute deviations of a dataset from its mean. This statistic is used to under￾stand the dispersion of data from a measure of central tendency. The mean absolute deviation can 
be determined using Eq. 2.29.
Mean absolute deviation (MAD) = ∑ − 1

2.10.1.6 Skewness
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution about its mean. Positive skewness 
indicates a longer tail of the frequency curve towards the higher value of the data. In other words, 
the mean is greater than the mode or median, and vice-versa. For symmetrical normal distribu￾tion, the mean, mode, and median coincide. If the skewness is close to zero, the distribution is 
approximately symmetric, and the median is close to the mean. The coefficient of skewness can be 
determined using the following equations.
Pearson’s coefficient of skewness uses the mode is given by
Coefficient of skewness
Mean Mode
Satandard Deviation = − = x − ν

If the mode does not exist for the data, the coefficient of skewness can be determined as
Coefficient of skewness
Mean Median
Satandard Deviation = ( − ) = 3 3( ) x − Md
σ
(2.32)
where x, σ, ν, and Md
 are the mean, standard deviation, mode, and median of the data, respectively.
The coefficient of skewness, represented in Eq. 2.32, uses the median value of the data instead 
of the mode of the data.
Example 2.28: Determine the skewness of the data given in Example 2.17.
Solution
Given data: 160 172.5 161 180 175 165 162.5
The mean, median, and standard deviation of the given data are as follows:
Mean(x ) = 168tonnes [Refer Example 2.17]
Median t (ν) = 165 onnes [Refer Example 2.20]
Standard deviation(σ) = 7 80. tonnes [Refer Example 2.24]
The mode value of the given data does not exist, and thus the second formula for the coefficient of 
skewness is used.

Thus, the coefficient of skewness of the given data is 1.15.
2.10.1.7 Coefficient of variation

distribution. The CV can be calculated as:44 Optimization techniques and their applications

expectations.
E X X X E X E X E X 1 2 n n 1 2 ( ) + +… = ( ) + ( ) +… ( ) (2.37)

• Exit 3 leads back to the district after 10 minutes.

2.10.1.9 Variance and covariance
The variance of a random variable, X defined as the mean squared deviation of the same variable 
from the mean. In other words, for any random variable, it measures the level of spread of data from 
its mean.
The variance for continuous random variable is equal to the expected value of (X −µ)

The variance for discrete random variable is given by
Variance of X X = Var( ) = E X( – – µ µ ) = ∑(X P ) (X) 2 2 (2.42)
A high variance indicates that the observed values of X are highly dispersed from its mean. On the 
other hand, a lower variance of X indicates that the values are clustered tightly around its mean.
Properties of Variance
• The variance of a constant time random variable is the constant squared times the variance of 
a random variable and is generally denoted simply as
Var V (cX)= c X ar( ) 2 (2.43)
• Let X and Y be independent random variables. Then
Var V (X Y+ )= ar(X Y )+ Var( ) (2.44)
• If X and Y are dependent random variables, then
Var V (X Y+ )= ar(X V )+ ar(Y C ) + 2 , ov(X Y ) (2.45)
In Eq. (2.45), Cov X( ,Y ) represents the covariance of X and Y. Covariance is a measure of the asso￾ciation or dependence between two random variables, X and Y. The covariance between two random 
variables depends on extend of the data values. Covariance can be either positive or negative.
The covariance between X and Y is given by
Cov X Y E X Y E XY EXE Y X Y ( , ) = − { } ( ) µ µ ( ) − = ( ) − ( ) ( ) (2.46)
where µ X = = Mean of all X E(X) and µY = = Mean of all Y E(Y )

2.10.1.10 Correlation coefficient
It indicates the relationship between two random variables by measuring the level of change that 
occurs in one random variable due to change in the other. If the value of one variable is increased, 
the value of the other variable also increases then correlation is called a positive correlation and vice￾versa. A higher value of coefficient indicates a high correlation between the two random variables 
and vice-versa. The value of the correlation coefficient is always ranges between −1 and +1.
The correlation coefficient can be calculated using the covariance, scaled by the overall vari￾ability of two random variables.
If two random variables, X and Y, are measured n number of times and observed as xi

2.10.2  Standard analysis tools of inferential statistics
In inferential statistics, the population is defined first, and then a sampling plan is devised to obtain 
a representative sample. The statistical results involve uncertainty as sample data is used to under￾stand an entire population. The most common types of analyses are hypothesis tests, confidence 
intervals, and regression analysis. Interestingly, these inferential methods can produce similar sum￾mary values as descriptive statistics, such as the mean and standard deviation.
2.10.2.1 Hypothesis Tests
Hypothesis tests use sample data to answer questions like the following:
• Is the population mean greater than or less than a particular value?
• Are the means of two or more populations different from each other?
Example 2.31: A geologist employed in a mine claims that the grades of ore of the deposit are above 
the cut-off grade (56%). The mean grade of 30 random samples is 60%, and the standard deviation 
is 5%. Is there sufficient evidence to support the geologist’s claim?
Solution
Null hypothesis:
The accepted fact is that the cut-off grade is 56%, and hence the null hypothesis can be defined as:
H0
: μ = 56%.Basics of probability and statistics 49
49
Alternate hypothesis:
It is claimed that the grade of the ore deposit is above the cut-off grade, and hence the alternative 
hypothesis can be defined as:
H1
: μ > 56%.
This is a one-tailed test as scores are determined for greater than a certain mean value. In a one￾tailed test, the critical area of a distribution is one-sided (either greater than or less than a specific 
value), but not both.
Assuming the data follow a normal distribution, we want to test the hypothesis with a 95% con￾fidence level. Therefore, the value of α is 5% (=0.05). An area of 0.05 is equal to a z-score of 1.645 
(Refer to z-table corresponding to row value of 1.6 in z-column and 0.045 across at the top), as 
shown in Figure 2.21.
In the next step, the rejection region area for the defined α level (=5%) needs to be determined 
from the z-table. The test statistic can be determined using this formula:
z
x
n = ( ) − = ( − ) = µ
σ
0 60 56
5
30
2 19
/ .
If the calculated z-statistics value is less than the z-score obtained for the defined α-level (=0.05), 
the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. In this case, it is greater (2.19 > 1.645), and hence the null 
hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, the claim that the grade of the ore deposit is above the cut-off 
grade is correct with a 95% confidence level.
Example 2.32: The mean and standard deviation of the of Bauxite ore grades are 40% and 6%, 
respectively. The estimated grade value, based on the 40 samples, is 42%. Test a hypothesis at 
α = 0.05 that the mean grade in this population differs from 40%.
FIGURE 2.21 Shaded area representing the probability for z ≥ 1.645.50 Optimization techniques and their applications
50
Solution
Null hypothesis:
In this case, the null hypothesis is that the population mean 40%, and hence the null hypothesis can 
be written as:
H0
: μ = 40%
Alternative hypothesis:
It needs to be examined that mean of the observed samples (42%) represents a different population 
from the given population mean of Bauxite, i.e., 40%. Therefore, the alternate hypothesis can be 
written as:
H1
: μ ≠ 40%
The test statistic can be determined using this formula:

n = ( ) − = ( − ) = µ

/ .
The p-value corresponding to a z-score of 2.10 can be determined from the z-statistics table. The 
value corresponding to a row of 2.1 in z-column and 0.00 across at the top represents the p-value for 
a z-score of 2.10. This is equal to 0.0178. Thus, there is only a 1.78% chance of getting a mean of 
42% or more. At α = 0.05, the null hypothesis, H0
 can be rejected, and it is evident that the observed 
mean is different from the population mean.

mining systems
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Linear Programming (LP) is a branch of optimization that minimizes (or maximizes) a linear 
objective function subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints (Cococcioni and 
Fiaschi, 2021). The LP is a widely applied technique both in theoretical and real-world contexts, 
especially in engineering applications. The simplex algorithm is one of its most used algorithms, 
which was proposed by Kantorovič and Dantzig in the 1940s. Dantzig independently developed 
formulation of general linear programming during 1946–1947 to use for the US Air Force planning 
problems (Dantzig and Thapa, 1997). At the same time, Dantzig (1948) invented the simplex algo￾rithm for solving the linear programming problem efficiently. Subsequently, he planned for solving 
the industrial and business problems. The simplex method has been applied to solve linear problems 
in different fields like agriculture, human resources and manufacturing decision making, and so on, 
to optimize maximum profit and minimize cost. The same method is used in Excel solver to solve 
linear programming problems. Most researchers in this field (Kurtz, 1992; Taha, 2008; Ezema and 
Amakon, 2012) applied linear programming in the allocation of scarce resources in the manufac￾turing industry to boost the output.
3.2 DEFINITION OF LINEAR PROGRAMMING PROBLEM (LPP)
The linear programming problem (LPP) aims to obtain the best solution for the objective of a 
given problem within the solution space. The objective of the problem is defined by an objective 
function, and the solution space is defined by a set of constraints. If the objective function and all 
the constraints of the problem are linear, the problem is said to be an LPP. The objective function 
of the problem may be of maximizing or minimizing, and the constraints are either equalities or 
inequalities. In other words, an LPP problem is an optimization model where all the components 
of the objective function and constraints are linear. In the last few decades, many algorithms have 
been designed to solve the LPPs. LPP is one of the most popular optimization algorithms applied 
ever in all systems, including mine systems. Many software packages are available in the market 
for solving the large-scale LPPs. The most commonly used algorithm to solve the LPPs is the sim￾plex method.
The generalized structure of an LPP can be represented as:
Maximize M( inimize O )Z C= + x C x C +…+ x bjective function 1 1 2 2 n n
Subject to a x a x a x b Constraint 11 1 12 2 1 1 n n + +…+ ≤ ( )1
a x a x a x b 21 1 22 2 2 2 n n + +…+ ≤ Constraint( ) 2
…
a x a x a x b m m 1 1 2 2 mn n m + +…+ ≤ Constraint( ) m
x x,,, x 1 2 n … ≥ 0 Non-negativityconstraint56 Optimization techniques and their applications
56
In the above LPP, Z is called the objective function that needs to be optimized. The variables 
x x x 1 2 n ,,, … are called decision variables. All the decision variables are subject to non-negative 
constraints. The problem has m number of constraints, which demarcate the solution space. A solu￾tion that falls within the solution space and satisfies all the m number of constraints is called a feas￾ible solution. The solution space is defined as the feasible region.
C C C 1 2 n , ,…, are cost coefficients of decision variables in the objective function.
a a a i i 1 2 in , ,…, are coefficients of decision variables for i
th constraint (i m = … 0 1, , , )
In any LPP, both the objective function and the constraints are linear functions of decision 
variables. Any set of values assigned to the decision variables in a given LPP is defined as a solu￾tion. It may or may not satisfy any or all of the constraints.
Moreover, if the solution satisfies all the constraints of the problem, the solution is referred to 
as a feasible solution. On the other hand, any solution that violates at least one of the constraints is 
referred to as an infeasible solution.
3.3 SOLUTION ALGORITHMS OF LPP
It is important to judge the optimization algorithms before applying them to solve an LPP. To solve 
an LPP, multiple assumptions are implicit. These assumptions are:
• Proportionality: The contribution of each variable, xi
 to the objective function, Z is propor￾tional to the coefficient of that variable. Mathematically, this is represented in Eq. (3.1)
Z ∝ Ci (3.1)
where Ci
 is coefficient of a decision variable xi
 in the objective function, Z.
• Additivity: The total contribution of all variables to the objective function is the sum of the 
individual contribution of the respective variables, as shown in Eq. (3.2).
Z C x
i
n
i i =
=
∑1
(3.2)
• Divisibility: Any decision variable can be fractions if satisfying the functional and non￾negativity constraint.
• Certainty: All the parameters or coefficients in the objective function and the constraints are 
known with certainty.
3.3.1 Graphical method
The graphical method is only applicable to solve an LPP that has a maximum of two deci￾sion variables. In the graphical method, the problem can be solved in four major steps, as 
explained below.
Step 1: Formulation of the LPP: The objective function along with all the constraints should be 
formulated for the defined system.
Step 2: Plot the graph using all the constraint lines: In most of the cases, decision variables are 
≥ 0, and hence the graph can be drawn only in the first quadrant.
Step 3: Identification of feasible solution space.
Step 4: Identification of the optimal solution from all the feasible solutions. In general, the 
optimal solution (maximum or minimum) in a feasible region represents by one or more corner 
points. This is because the maximum/minimum distance from the origin is always represented 
by any of the corner points in the case of a linear line.Linear programming for mining systems 57
57
• If the goal is to minimize the objective function, the point closest to the origin gives the min￾imum value of the objective function.
• If the goal is to maximize the objective function, the point farthest from the origin gives the 
maximum value of the objective function.
Example 3.1
A mine produces ores, classified into two types based on the grade value. The first one is above the 
cut-off grade (G1), and the other is below the cut-off grade (G2). Before supplying to consumers, 
the two types of ores are mixed in order to maintain the cut-off grade. The mixture of two types of 
ores sends in a maximum of 100-tonne batches. The profit for grade G1 and grade G2 are US$50 
per tonne and US$30 per tonne. A typical batch should contain at least 50 tonnes of grade G1 and 20 
tonnes of grade G2. Determine the optimal mixture that will maximize profit.
Solution
In the first step, the given problem is formulated as an LPP using mathematical equations.
Let a batch of 100 tonne consists of x1
 tonne of grade G1 and x2
 tonne of grade G2.
The goal of the problem is to maximize the total profit. The objective function of the problem is 
given by
Maximum Z = 50x x Objective function 1 2 + 30
Subject to, ( x x Constraint ) 1 2 + ≤ 100 1
x1 ≥ 50 2 Constraint( )
x2 ≥ 20 3 Constraint( )
x x 1 2 ≥ 0, Non-negativityconstraint
Constraint (1) represents that the batch should be at most 100 tonnes of coal. Constraints (2) and 
(3) indicate the minimum amount of ore of two grades that need to be added in the mixture of 100-
tonne batches, respectively. The non-negativity constraints indicate that the decision variables are 
non-negative.
In the next step, the problem is represented in a graphical diagram, as represented in 
Figure 3.1(a)–(c).
The next step is to identify the feasible region and feasible solutions. The non-negativity con￾straint of the decision variables is restricted the solution space only in the first quadrant, where 
both the decision variables are positive. Constraint (1) further narrowed down the solution space, 
as shown in Figure 3.1(a). Due to inequality constraint, all the points in the shaded region satisfy 
the constraint (1), and hence it represents the feasible solution space. In addition to constraint 
(2) in the problem, the feasible solution space is further narrowed down, as shown in Figure 3.1(b). 
Since the constraint is greater and equal, the points away from the origin satisfy the constraint. 
Point C represents the intersection of constraint (1) and constraint (2). The addition of the third 
constraint further reduces the feasible solution space, as shown in Figure 3.1(c). Constraint 
(3) intersects the constraint (1) and constraint (2) at A and B, respectively. In Figure 3.1(c), 
the feasible region is the triangle ABC. Any points within the triangle ABC will satisfy all the 
constraints of the problem.
The optimal solution needs to be identified from all the feasible solutions to obtain the maximum 
value of the objective function and hence the profit. The number of solution points in the feasible 
space ABC is infinite and thus need to identify the optimal solution through a systematic procedure. 
First, the direction in which the value of the objective function, Z increases (decreases for minimizes 58 Optimization techniques and their applications
58
objective function) need to be identified by arbitrarily choosing the value of the decision variables 
from the feasible space. The value of Z increases as the solution point is moving away from the 
origin, as demonstrated in Figure 3.2. The optimal solution is found at point B, which lay on the 
feasible region beyond which any further increases leads to an infeasible solution. An important 
characteristic of an LPP is that one or more of the corner point offers the optimal (maximum/min￾imum) value of the objective function. Thus, the value of the objective function should be examined 
for all the three corner points (A, B, and C). These are shown in Table 3.1.
FIGURE 3.1 Graphical representation of the feasible solution space: (a) feasible space satisfying constraint 
(1), (b) feasible space satisfying constraints (1) and (2), and (c) feasible space satisfying constraints (1), (2), 
and (3).
FIGURE 3.2 Searching of the optimal solution in the feasible space for maximizing the objective function.Linear programming for mining systems 59
59
The results showed in Table 3.1 clearly indicate that the value of the objective function, Z is max￾imum at B (80, 20), and this is equal to US$460. Thus, this is the optimum solution out of all the 
feasible solutions.
It can be inferred that the optimal solution of an LPP is always associated with a corner point, 
which indicates that the search for the optimum is restricted to a finite number of points rather than 
infinite. The role of corner points in identifying the optimum solution is the key to the development 
of the general solution algorithm, called the simplex algorithm.
The above problem has only one optimal solution, and hence the nature of the solution is a 
unique solution. A problem may characterize with other types of solutions like multiple solutions 
or infinitely many solutions, as explained below.
3.3.1.1 Multiple Solutions
If the LPP has more than one optimal solution, then it is designated as a multiple solutions problem. 
In the case of multiple solutions, the value of the objective function is optimal for multiple sets of 
feasible solutions. This is illustrated in Example 3.2.
Example 3.2
Maximise O Z x = + 2 x bjective function 1 2
Subject to 2 20 1 Constraint 1 2 x x + ≤ ( )
2 3 30 2 1 2 x x + ≤ Constraint( )
x x 1 2 ≥ 0, Non-negativityconstraint
The problem is graphically represented in Figure 3.3, and the objective function values for different 
corner-point solutions are presented in Table 3.2.
It is already seen in Example 3.1 that the optimal solution is associated with one or more of the 
corner points. But, if the slope of the objective function is parallel to any of the bounded constraint, 
all the points on the line AB offer the same value of the objective function. Thus, an infinite number 
of optimal solutions exist for the problem.
The results shown in Table 3.2 indicate that the value of objective function Z is maximum at two 
points, A (10, 0) and B (15/2, 5), and this is equal to 20. Thus, there is more than one solution at 
which the value of the objective function is optimum. All the points lying on the line AB offer the 
same maximum value of the objective function. The problem has infinitely many solutions.

3.3.1.2 Unbounded solution
An LPP has an unbounded solution if the value of the objective function can be reached up to infinity 
without violating any of the constraints. This is illustrated in Example 3.3.
Example 3.3
Maximise O Z x = + x bjective function 1 2
Subject to x Constraint 1 ≥ 5 1( )
x2 ≤ 10 2 Constraint( )

The problem is graphically represented in Figure 3.4.
Figure 3.4 clearly tells that the value of the objective function can reach up to ∞ (Z = ∞) at x1
 = ∞, 
x2
 = 10. This indicates that the problem has an unbounded solution in one direction. In the above 
diagram, there is no boundary or intersection points beyond the point B to give a bounded feasible 
solution. Thus, the above problem has an unbounded solution.

3.3.2  Simplex method
The simplex method is a linear-programming solution algorithm that can solve problems with any 
number of decision variables in contrast to a graphical method, which can handle only two deci￾sion variables. Any linear programming problem can be defined in two forms, viz. primal and dual. 
The simplex algorithm on a primal problem starts with a feasible but non-optimal solution. It was 
observed that the optimal solution of a linear problem is represented by one or more corner points. 
The primal simplex algorithm starts with a feasible solution and reaches optimality through the 
iterative method with satisfying the feasibility conditions. The initial feasible solution corresponds 
to the origin, and subsequent iteration is developed by shifting to an adjacent corner point in the 
direction that yields the better value.
On the other hand, the dual problems are those for which it is easy to obtain an initial basic solu￾tion, which is infeasible but satisfies the optimality criterion.
Simplex algorithm
The algorithm is demonstrated with a generalized example of a linear programming problem. In the 
first case, the algorithm is explained for an LPP with only slack variables; that is, the problem has only 
less and equal type (inequality) constraints. The algorithm is explained with a generalized form of LPP.

The steps involved in solving an LPP using the simplex method are explained below.
FIGURE 3.4 Graphical representation of the problem.62 Optimization techniques and their applications
62
Step 1: Formulation of the standard form of the problem
Each inequality constraint should be converted into an equality constraint by introducing a slack vari￾able to the left-hand side. The coefficients of all these slack variables in the objective function will 
be zero. The nature of variables needs to be added for a different form of constraints is summarized 
in Table 3.3.
In the simplex method, the LPP is written in a standard form with a maximization problem, as 
demonstrated below.
A standard form of the LPP:
Z C x C x C x y y y n n m − − −… − − −… = 1 1 2 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 Objective function

x x x y y y 1 2 n m 1 2 , , … … , , , , , N ≥ 0 on-negativityconstraint
In the standard form of LPP, S S S 1 2 m , ,…, are called slack variables. The coefficients of all the slack 
variables in the objective function are equal to zero.
Step 2: Finding an initial basic feasible solution or starting solution
The starting solution of an LPP, which is basic and feasible, is termed as an initial basic feasible 
solution. A basic solution, which is feasible, is called a basic feasible solution.
In an LPP, the number of basic variables is equal to the number of equality constraints. The set of 
basic variables in a solution is defined as a basis. All the variables under the basis are non-negative 
in nature. All variables outside the basis are designated as non-basic variables. All the non-basic 
variables are zeros.
If an LPP has n decision variables and m slack variables, then the basic solution has m number 
of basic variables and n number of non-basic variables. The basic solution should have at most m
non-zero variables, which is equal to the number of equality constraint or slack variables and at 
least n zero-valued variables, number of decision variables. Therefore, the initial solution of the 
above generalized problem is a basic solution in which x x x x 1 2 3 n ,,,, … are non-basic variables and 
y y y 1 2 m , ,…, are basic variables.

In the standard form of the generalized LPP, the total number of variables is (n + m). Out of 
(n +m) variables, n numbers are decision variables, and m numbers are slack variables. A unique 
solution of m number of slack variables in the problem can be determined by setting the remaining 
n decision variables equal to zero.

Step 3: Formulation of the initial simplex tableau
The initial simplex tableau is formed with the structure as shown in Table 3.4(a).
Step 4: Method of iteration
Step 4.1: Selection of entering variable
A new basis will be formed by replacing one of the current basic variables (y1
/ y2
/…ym) with a non￾basic variable (x1
/ x2
/…xn
). The non-basic variable selected to enter into the basis depends on the 
extent of the improvement in the objective function value. The non-basic variable, which decreases 
(increases for minimization problem) the Z-value maximum, is chosen as a basic variable for the 
next iteration. The variable is also called entering variable. In case of a tie, either of the variables 
can be chosen. The highest negative coefficient increases the value of the objective function most. 
The column of entering variable is called the pivotal column.
A non-basic variable with the most negative value (in case of maximization) or with the most 
positive (in case of minimization) in the Z-row should be selected as the entering variable. The 
entering variable column is called the ‘pivot column’, as shown in Table 3.4(b). It is assumed that 
Cr
 is the highest negative value in the Z-row under the non-basic variable, and thus xr
 is selected as 
entering variable.
Step 4.2: Selection of departing variable
• Identify strictly positive (>0) coefficients (a1r, a2r,…,) in the pivot column for all constraints.

• Identify the row, which exhibits the smallest ratios (bi

In Eq. (3.3), ‘i’ represents the row, and ‘r’ represents the pivot column (corresponding to the 
entering variable, xr
). If all the coefficients (air ) in the pivot column, r, are negative in nature, then 
the problem is ill-defined, and the problem leads to an unbounded solution.

The basic variable (yi
) correspond to the smallest ratio is identified as the departing variable. The 
departing variable row is called the ‘pivot row’, as indicated in Table 3.4(c). In case of a tie, either 
of the variables can be chosen.
• Replace the departing variable by the entering variable in the basic variable column of the next 
simplex tableau.
Step 4.3: Solve for the new solution by using elementary row operations using Gauss￾Jordan transformation as:
• The new pivot row can be updated by dividing the old pivot row by the ‘pivot number’ 
(the number at the intersection of the pivot row and pivot column). Thus, the new 
pivot row is

• All other rows can be updated as:

Step 5: Checking the Optimality
The optimality of the problem should be examined after obtaining a new solution. If all the 
coefficients in the Z-row are non-negative for the maximization problem (non-positive for mini￾mization problem), then the solution is optimal, and no further iteration is needed.
If there is a zero coefficient under any of the non-basic variables in the Z-row, then an alter￾nate solution of the problem exists. This can be determined using a similar procedure with further 
iteration.
The above simplex algorithm is applied to solve the LPP, as demonstrated in Example 3.4.
Example 3.4
An open-pit mine produces ores of two designated grades (G1 and G2) from two different working 
benches in two stages, viz. ore breakage through drilling-blasting and transportation through haul￾truck. Each stage has an operating time of 8 hours in a shift. It is observed that 1000 units of G1 type 
ore require 2 hours of operation on Stage 1 and 3 hours on Stage 2. For G2 type of ore, 1000 units 
require 3 hours of operation at Stage 1 and 2 hours at Stage 2. The revenues per unit of G1 and G2 
types of ores are US$180 and US$150, respectively. Determine the optimal production plan.

respectively, in 8 hours. The LPP of the defined problem can be formulated as

The problem has two constraints, and thus two slack variables y1
 and y2
, are introduced. Both the 
slack variables are non-negative.

In the next step of the simplex method, an initial basic feasible solution needs to be identified.
The initial basic feasible solution is identified by setting all the decision variables (in this case, 
x1
 and x2
) equal to zero. That is, all the decision variables are non-basic variables, and all the slack 
variables are basic variables in the initial basic feasible solution. The values of slack variables at the 
initial basic feasible solution can be determined from the constraint functions.
From the first constraint, 2 0 3 0 0 8 * * + + y y 1 2 + = *
y1 = 8
Similarly, from the second constraint, 3 2 0 8 1 2 1 2 x x + + y y + =
y2 = 8
The initial basic feasible solution of the given problem is
x x y y 1 2 1 2 ( ) = = 0 0 , , = = 8 8 ,
At the starting solution, the value of the objective function is given by
180 0 150 * * + +0 0* * 8 0 + = 8 0
The basic feasible solution at the initial tableau is (x1
 = 0, x2
 = 0, y1
 = 8, y2
 = 8). The initial basic 
feasible solution represents one of the corner points (origin: 0, 0). Thus, y1
 and y2
 are basic variables, 
and x1
 and x2
 are non-basic variables in the initial basic feasible solution. The initial basic feasible 
solution is represented in Table 3.5(a).
The next step is to find a better solution through an iterative process. In a subsequent iteration, 
the solution is shifted to a new corner point adjacent to the previous solution in the feasible region, 
which offers a better solution.
Selection of entering variable: In this case, the most positive coefficient in Z-row is 180, which 
is under x1
. Thus, x1
 should be chosen as an entering variable. The highest positive coefficient

increases the value of the objective function most. Thus, column x1
 is chosen as the pivotal 
column.
Departing Variable: In this case, out of the two basic variables (y1
 or y2
), one should depart the 
basis to allow entry of x1
 into the new basis. The ratio, as demonstrated in Eq.(3.1), is used to 
select the departing variable.
In this case, the minimum ratio is obtained for basic variable y2
, as shown in Table 3.5(b). Therefore, 
y2
 is chosen as a departing variable.
Thus, x1
 replaces y2
 in the new solution, where y x 1 1 and are the member of the basis. The new pivot 
row (Row 2) is obtained using the Gauss-Jordan transformation, as explained in Eq. (3.2) and Eq. (3.3).

The revised simplex table, after the first iteration, is shown in Table 3.5(c).
After completion of the first iteration, the value of the objective function is increased to 480 
from 0.
Checking the optimality
The optimality of the problem should be examined after obtaining a new solution. The solution is 
not optimal as there is still one negative coefficient (−30) in the Z-row under non-basic variable (x2
). 
Thus, a further iteration is required to obtain the optimal solution. This time, the entering variable is 
x2
, as it has the maximum negative coefficient in the Z-row. On the other hand, the departing variable 
is y1
, as it has the minimum ratio. The revised value after the second iteration is shown in Table 3.5(d).

It is clear from the simplex table that no negative coefficient exists in the Z-row under the basic 
variable. Thus, the solution reached the optimal stage, and no further iteration was required.
However, in this case, no zero exists in the Z-row under the non-basic variable, and hence the 
problem has a unique solution.
Thus, the optimal solution is
x1
 = 8/5, x2
 = 8/5, Z = 180*8/5 +150*8/5 = 528
Therefore, the maximum revenue can be obtained as US$528.
Special cases of LPP solutions
• Multiple solutions or infinitely many solutions: If zero is found under one or more non￾basic variables in the optimal solution tableau, the problem has multiple optimal solutions.
• Unbounded solution: If there is no positive ratio found while calculating the leaving variable 
in any simplex tableau (all the entries in the pivot column are negative and zeroes), the solu￾tion is unbounded.
• Degenerated solution: If the basic variable is assigned to zero value in the solution, the solu￾tion is termed as degenerate solution.
3.3.3 Big-​M method
Although the simplex algorithm is the most powerful to solve the LPP, it has an initialization problem 
like the starting solution must be a basic feasible to solve the problem. If the LPP has any equality 
or greater and equality constraints, it has to incorporate an artificial or surplus variable to convert 
into a standardized form. In that case, the simplex algorithm cannot be directly applied due to the 
initialization issue. To overcome the initialization problem, two approaches (the Big-M method and

two-phase method) may be used to solve the problem. These methods can accommodate both posi￾tive and negative aspects of the initial basic feasible solution. The Big-M method is explained with 
Example 3.5.
Example 3.5
A company has two iron ore mines and a processing plant, located 20 km away from the first mine 
and 5 km from the second mine. Both the mines produce ores and are transported to the processing 
plant through conveyor belts. The hourly production of ore and waste in the first mine is 300 tonnes 
and 100 tonnes, respectively, and the corresponding operational cost is US$4000. Similarly, the 
hourly production of ore and waste in the second mine is 100 tonnes and 100 tonnes, respectively, 
and the corresponding operational cost is US$1000. To meet customer demands, at least 6000 tonnes 
of ores must be processed daily. Also, in order to comply with government regulations, at most, 5000 
tonnes of waste can be produced daily from both mines. Determine the optimum working hours in 
two mines for minimizing the operational cost.
Solution
Assuming that x1
 is the number of operating hours per day of process 1 and x2
 is the number of 
operating hours per day of process 2, the mathematical formulation of the linear program becomes
Minimize O Z x = + 4000 1000x bjective function 1 2

100 100 5000 2 1 2 x x + ≤ Constraint( )
x x 1 2 ≥ 0; Non-negativity constraint
The objective of the problem is to minimize the operational cost subject to satisfying the constraints 
of productions of mineral and waste. The constraint with ≥ sign needs to incorporate a surplus in 
addition to an artificial variable to make it an equality constraint, as explained in Table 3.3. The 
standardized objective function is derived by adding (subtracting for maximization problem) the 
right-hand side with the multiplication of artificial variables and a big number (M), as shown below 
in the standard form of the objective function. The reason for choosing a big number, M, is that the 
values of artificial variables (A A A 1 2 n , ,…, ) becomes zero in the final (optimal) tableau. The rules for 
adding artificial variables are as follows:
• For Minimization objective function, A A A 1 2 n , ,…, must be added to the RHS of the objective 
function multiplied by a big number (M).
• For Maximization objective function, A A A 1 2 n , ,…, must be subtracted from the RHS of the 
objective function multiplied by a very large number (M)

The initial solution of the problem is obtained by equating the decision and surplus variable zero. 
Thus, in the initial solution, y1
 and A1
 are basic variables. The initial simplex tableau is shown in 
Table 3.6(a).
To apply the simplex method, the coefficients in the Z-row under all basic variables should be 
equal to zero except on surplus variables, which have no restrictions. This is not followed in the 
initial simplex tableau, as demonstrated in Table 3.2(a). This can be done through elementary row 
operations, as shown in Eq. 3.6.
New (Z row) = Old (Z row) ± M (A1
 row) ± M (A2
 row)… M (An
 row) (3.6)
In this case, the new Z-row is obtained as follows:
Old (Z row): –4000 −1000 0 0 −M 0
M (A1
 row) 300M 100M −M 0 M 6000M
New (Z row): 300M−4000 100M−1000 −M 0 0 6000M
 
 Becomes zero
The revised simplex tableau is shown in Table 3.6(b).
Now the same simplex algorithm can be applied to solve the problem. Since there is a positive 
value in the Z-row under non-basic variables excluding surplus variable in Table 3.6(b), the initial 
solution is not optimal. The entering variable is the most positive value in the Z-row under non￾basic variables. It is clear from Table 3.6(b) that x1
 has the maximum positive value (300M-4000) 
and is thus selected as an entering variable. The departing variable is chosen based on the smallest 
ratio. The ratios showed in Table 3.6(b) indicate that A1
 has the smallest ratio and is thus chosen as 
a departing variable. The new rows are determined using Gauss Jordan transformation as explained 
in the simplex method. The revised simplex tableau is shown in Table 3.6(c).

In Table 3.6(c), it can be observed that still there is a positive value in the Z- row under non-basic 
variable excluding the surplus variable, and thus the solution is not optimal. The entering variable 
is the most positive value in the Z-row. It is clear from Table 3.6(c) that the entering variable is x2
(maximum positive value =1000/3), and the leaving variable is y1
 (smallest ratio =45).
The current solution is optimal no positive coefficients exist in the Z-row under the basic variable, 
excluding the surplus variable.
Thus, the optimal solution is
x1
 = 25/2 = 12.5, x2
 = 45/2 = 22.5, Z = 72500
Thus, the total operational cost is US$72500 for 12.5 working hours in the first mine and 22.5 hours 
in the second mine.
Special cases of solution of Big-M method
• If one or more artificial variables (A1
, A2
, …, An
) are found to be in the basis and have a non￾zero value in the RHS of the optimal tableau, then the problem has an infeasible solution.
• The other conditions explained for the simplex method are also applicable for this method.
The readers, who are interested to learn the algorithm of the two-phase simplex method, can refer to 
Taha (2016). In this method, the problem is solved in two phases. In phase I, a starting basic feasible 
solution is identified; whereas, in phase 2, the original problem is solved.
3.4 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Sensitivity analysis of an LPP also referred to as post-optimality analysis, is an exercise to under￾stand the impacts of the coefficients of the objective function and resource limits of the constraints

on the final solution. It finds a new solution without solving afresh. The sensitivity analysis of an 
LPP is done to examine the effect of change in the data of the original problem on the optimality. 
This type of analysis is important for a dynamic system, where the coefficients of the objective 
function and availability of resources of the constraints are not estimated with certainty.
3.4.1 Graphical method of sensitivity analysis
The graphical method of sensitivity analysis can be applied to an LPP with a maximum of two deci￾sion variables. The graphical method of sensitivity analysis is explained using a decision-making 
problem, as defined in Example 3.4.

The sensitivity analysis of an LPP is conducted in two ways, viz. change in the input resources or 
right-hand side of the constraint and change in the cost coefficients of the objective functions. The 
following types of post-optimal analyses can be done in sensitivity analysis of the problem.
Case I: Changes in the available resources or RHS of the constraints
The sensitivity of the model is analyzed for change in operating hours of Stage 1/Stage 2. It is clear 
that increasing or decreasing the available resources or RHS of the constraints, which represents 
total working hours of Stage 1 or Stage 2, moves the corresponding constraint parallel to itself 
provided the coefficients in the constraint are not changed. The current solution is optimal until the 
first and second constraints intersecting with each other.
Figure 3.6(a) illustrates the change in the optimum solution when changes are made in the total 
working hours of Stage 1. If the working hour of Stage 1 is increased from 8 hours to 9 hours, the 
new optimum will occur at point C1. The rate of change in the objective function (Maximise Z) 
resulting from changing working hour of Stage 1 from 8 hours to 9 hours can be determined as 
follows:

The computed revenue change rate directly links the available resources (input) and the total rev￾enue (output). That is, the rate represents the change in the optimal objective function value per unit 
change in the input resource availability is defined as the dual price. The result indicates that unit 
increase (decrease) in the total working hours of stage 1 will increase (decrease) the revenue by 
US$18. That is, the dual price of Stage 1 is US$18. The dual price represents the change in the price 
for a unit change in the conditions of service for the same product or service.
The dual price (prices in different conditions for the same product or service) of US$18/hour 
remains valid for changes (increases or decreases) in the total working hours in Stage 1 that move 
the constraint parallel to itself to any point on the line segment AD, as shown in Figure 3.6(a). That

is, the range of working hours for Stage 1 for which the dual price is valid should lay at points A and 
D. This means that the range of applicability of the given dual price can be computed as follows:

Changes outside this range will produce a different dual price, which needs different calculations 
with additional information.
In a similar way, Figure 3.6(b) indicates that the dual price of US$48/hour for Stage 2, which 
remains valid for changes (increases or decreases) in the range of B to E. In this case, the dual price 
remains valid for changes (increases or decreases) that move its constraint parallel to itself to any 
point on the line segment BE, as shown in Figure 3.6(b).

The computed range shown above for Stage 1 and 2 is designated as the range of feasibility. The 
economic decision is made based on the value of dual prices. The following questions of decision￾making analysis are answered through sensitivity analysis.
Q1. If the mining authority needs to increase the working hours for more revenue generation, 
which stage should be given higher priority?
The dual prices for Stage 1 and Stage 2 are US$18/hour, and US$48/hour, respectively. This 
indicates that each additional hour of Stage 2 will increase revenue by US$48/hour, as opposed to 
only US$18/hour for Stage 1. Thus, priority should be given to Stage 2.
On the other hand, if the problem has a minimization objective function, the constraint which has 
the lowest dual price should be given first priority.
Q2. If the additional cost incurred in increasing the working hours for both the stages is
US$30/hour, is it economical to adopt the same?
For Stage 2, the resultant net revenue per hour is US$(48 – 30) = US$18; and for Stage 1, the 
resultant net revenue is US$(18 – 30) = US$−12. Therefore, it is advisable to increase the working 
hours of Stage 2 only.Linear programming for mining systems 75
75
Q3. If the working hour of Stage 1 is increased from 8 hours to 12 hours, how will the optimum 
revenue change?
The dual price for Stage 1 is US$18/hour in the time range of 5.34 to 12 hours. The planned increase 
to 12 hours lies within the feasible range. The revenue gain is US$18*(12−8) = US$72. This result 
indicates that revenue will be increased to US$600 [= current revenue (US$528) + revenue gain 
(US$72)].
Q4. If the working hour of Stage 1 is increased from 8 hours to 16 hours, estimate the impact 
on optimal revenue.
The planned increase to 16 hours lies outside the feasible range of 5.34 hours to 12 hours, for which 
the dual price of US$48 is applicable. Based on the current information, the decision can be taken 
to increase the working hours of Stage 1 up to 12 hours. Beyond that, more information is needed to 
make the optimal decision. It should be noted that falling outside the feasible range does not indicate 
that the problem has infeasible or no solution.
Case 2: Changes in the coefficients of the objective functions
The feasible solution space for the problem, which is defined in Example 3.4, is shown in Figure 3.7.

Here, C1

The optimum solution will remain at point C as long as the slope of the objective function

the ratio C1

Any change in the objective function’s coefficients, the slope of the objective function, Z will change. 
But the optimum solution will remain at point C as long as the slope of the objective function lies 
between slopes of constraint lines AE (= –2/3) and BD (= –3/2). This indicates the optimum solu￾tion of the problem will remain at C as long as the slope of the objective function lies in the range of 
–2/3 to –3/2.
This information offers answers to the questions related to the optimal solution, as 
demonstrated below:

respectively, will the optimum solution remain the same (at point C)?

optimum value of the objective function, Z changes to 200 × (8 5/ / ) + × 140 (8 5) = US$544

In the above simplex tableau, two shaded regions have similar characteristics, and hence all the 
simplex iterations offer similar values in both portions. The optimum simplex tableau, derived in 
Table 3.5(d) for the same problem, can be written with similar values in both the shaded portion. The 
optimal simplex tableau, in this case, is shown in Table 3.8(b).
In the optimal simplex tableau [Table 3.8(b)], the optimal value of the objective function can be 
obtained by adding the RHS of the Z-row with the coefficients of T1
 and T2
 in the Z-row. Similarly, 
the decision variables at an optimal solution are the respective row’s RHS plus the coefficients of T1
and T2
. Thus, the new optimal tableau offers the following relationships:

x T T 2 1 2 = + 8 5/ / 3 5 − 2 5/ (3.9)
Eq. (3.7) gives the value of the optimal solution of the revised LPP at x1
 and x2
, which can be 
determined from Eq. (3.8) and Eq. (3.9), respectively. These three equations can be used to deter￾mine the shadow price and feasibility range.
A unit change in working hours in Stage 1 (T1
 = ± 1 hour) leads to a change in the Z value 
by US$18.
Similarly, a unit change in working hours in Stage 2 (T2
 = ± 1 hour) leads to a change in the Z
value by US$48.
This indicates that the corresponding shadow prices are US$18/hour and US$48/hour, respect￾ively, for Stage 1 and Stage 2. The same results were obtained in the graphical method of sensitivity 
analyses.
In the optimal simplex tableau, the basic variables are x1
 and x2
. The current optimal solution 
remains feasible until all the basic variables (x1
 and x2
) are non-negative in the optimal simplex 
tableau.
Therefore, from Eq. (3.8) and Eq. (3.9), we can write

The above conditions can estimate the individual constraint’s feasibility range associated with chan￾ging the resources one at a time. In the first case, if the working hour of Stage 1 changes keeping 
Stage 2 remain constant, then Eq. (3.10) and Eq. (3.11) become,

From Eq. (3.12) and Eq. (3.13), we can derive the following relationship:
− ≤ 2 6 ≤ 4 1 . T
In the same way, we can determine the range for T2
 as
− ≤ 2 6 ≤ 4 2 . T
The feasibility ranges of Stage 1 and Stage 2 can be determined from the constraint (1) and Constraint 
(2) by putting the minimum and maximum values of T1
 and T2, respectively.
For Stage 1
Minimum value = 8+T1
 = 8–2.6 = 5.4
Maximum value = 8+T1
 = 8 +4 = 12Linear programming for mining systems 79

For Stage 2
Minimum value = 8+T2
 = 8–2.6 = 5.4
Maximum value = 8+T2
 = 8 +4 = 12
The shadow prices and their feasibility range for the LPP (Example 3.4) are listed in Table 3.9.
For any simultaneous changes in the right-hand side, the shadow prices may remain applicable 
that keep the solution feasible even if the changes violate the individual ranges.

That is, T1

shadow prices will remain applicable, and the new optimum value of the objective function can be 
determined as:
Z = + 180 150 180 x x = + 0 2 150 4 4 = + 36 660 696 = 1 2 * * . . US$
Case 2: Changes in the coefficients in the objective function: In the second case, the sensitivity 
analysis is done to understand the change in the objective function value per unit change in the value 
of decision variables. The reduced cost for a decision variable is nonzero only when the variable’s 
value is equal to its upper or lower bound at the optimal solution.
Let c1
 and c2
 are the change in revenue (coefficients of the objective function) for two types of 
ore, respectively. The revised objective function for the LPP (Example 3.4) is given by

Therefore, the initial simplex tableau of the revised LPP is shown in Table 3.10(a).
The optimal simplex tableau can be derived directly without a fresh calculation of the entire 
steps using the following method. A new row, R, and a new column, C, are added in the optimal 
simplex tableau, which was derived in Table 3.5(d) of the original problem (Example 3.4). The

revised simplex tableau after adding a new row and column is shown in Table 3.10(b). Table 3.10(b)
is used to derive the revised optimal simplex tableau. The entries in the shaded row are the change ci
associated with variable xj
. For the shaded column, the Z-row element is 1 followed by a change in 
ci
 for the basic variable xi
. The ci
 value corresponds to all the non-basic variables being zero.
The method of deriving the elements of the optimal simplex tableau of the revised problem is 
demonstrated below.

The revised optimal simplex tableau is shown in Table 3.10(c).
The current solution remains optimal so long as the new coefficients in Row Z are non-negative 
for the maximization problem (non-positive for minimization problem). The mathematical 
representations of the non-negativity are shown in Eq. (3.14) and Eq. (3.15).

To determine the optimality range of individual variables, the cost coefficient of one variable is

If any of the conditions is not satisfied, a new solution needs to be determined.
It should be noted that the changes in c1

but that may not satisfy the simultaneous conditions and vice-versa.
For example, if the value of c1
 and c2
 are –70 and 20, the objective function becomes

3.5 THE DUAL PROBLEM
For every primal LPP, there is a dual LPP, which describes the original problem. The primal to dual 
conversion states that every maximization (or minimization) problem in primal form takes the form 
of minimization (or maximization) in the dual form. It is observed that solving a dual problem is 
easier than solving the primal problem if the primal problem has fewer decision variables and more 
constraints.
Furthermore, a primal problem with artificial variables is relatively cumbersome to solve, and 
this can be eliminated in the dual simplex method.
3.5.1  Formulation of dual problem for a given primal LPP
The method is explained with a generalized primal LPP as defined below:
Maximize O Z C x C x C x bjective function n n = + +…+ 1 1 2 2
Subject to a x a x a x b Constraint 11 1 12 2 1 1 n n + +…+ ≤ ( )1Linear programming for mining systems 83

a x a x a x b 21 2 22 3 2 2 n n + +…+ ≤ Constraint( ) 2
…
a x a x a x b m m 1 1 2 2 mn n m + +…+ ≤ Constraint( ) m
x x x 1 2 n ,,, … ≥ 0 Non-negativityconstraint
Followings are the rules to convert a primal LPP into a dual problem:
• The problem should be written in a standard form. If the problem is maximization (minimiza￾tion) then all the constraints should be converted into ≤ (≥) sign. The sign of the constraints 
is reversed in the dual problem. In the case of equality constraint, the corresponding dual 
variable will be unrestricted in nature. Similarly, if any variable in the primal problem is unre￾stricted in nature, then the corresponding dual constraint will be an equality constraint.
• For every constraint in the primal problem, there is a dual variable and vice-versa. If in a 
primal problem, there are m constraints, then the dual problem will have n variables (assuming 
x x x d d
m
d
1 2 , ,…, ). On the other hand, if the number of decision variables in the primal problem is 
n (x1
, x2,…, xn
), the number of constraints in the dual problem is n.
• The nature of the objective function is reversed in the dual problem. If the primal problem is 
maximization, the nature of the dual problem will be minimization and vice-versa.
• The right-hand sides of the primal problem (b1
, b2
,…, bm) form the coefficients of the dual 
variable in the objective function of the dual problem.
• The coefficients of the objective function of the primal problem (C1
, C2
,…, Cn
) form the right￾hand side of the constraints in the dual problem.
• All the decision variables in the dual problem should be greater or equal to zero.
The summarised form of the conversion of primal LPP into dual form is demonstrated in 
Table 3.11.

The optimal value of any primal problem and its corresponding dual problem should always be the

This is a minimization problem, and thus all the constraints should be of ≥ types. Thus, multiplying 
by −1 on both the sides of constraint (2), we get

3.5.2  Dual simplex algorithm
In a dual simplex method, the LP starts with an optimum value of the objective function, which is 
infeasible. In every iteration, the solution moves toward feasibility without violating optimality. The 
algorithm ends when feasibility is restored.
The method will be demonstrated with three variables generalized dual problem, as given below.

Steps of dual simplex algorithm
Step 1: Write the problem in standard form. Convert the problem into a minimization problem if 
it is maximization by multiplying with −1. All the inequalities with a ≤ sign should be converted Linear programming for mining systems 87
87
into ≥ sign constraints by multiplying with −1 in both the side of the inequality. All equality 
constraints should be replaced with two constraints, one with a ≥ sign and another with a ≤ sign.
In the given problem, Constraint (1) is ≥ type and needs to convert ≤ type by multiplying with -1 on 
both sides. Therefore, constraint (1) becomes
− − a x a x − ≤ a x −b d d d
11 1 12 2 13 3 1 Constraint( ) 1a
Similarly, Constraint (3) is = type, and thus two new constraints need to be derived. One with ≥ type 
and another with ≤ type, as shown below:
a x a x a x b d d d
31 1 32 2 33 3 3 + + ≤ Constraint( ) 3a
a x a x a x b d d d
31 1 32 2 33 3 3 + + ≥ Constraint( ) 3b
Constraint (3b) further needs to convert into ≤ type by multiplying with −1, as given below:
− − a x a x − ≤ a x −b d d d
31 1 32 2 33 3 3 Constraint( ) 3b’
Thus, the revised problem is

Step 2: Selection of departing variable: In the dual simplex method, the departing variable is 
chosen first. The departing variable is the basic variable having the most negative value in the 
RHS column. If there is a tie, it can be broken arbitrarily. If all the basic variables are non￾negative, the algorithm ends.

 is the most negative value in the RHS column, and thus y1
 is chosen as the departing variable, 
as indicated in Table 3.12(b). Therefore, Row 1 is the pivot-row.
Step 3: Selection of entering variable: The entering variable is selected from the non-basic vari￾able, which has negative coefficients using the following ratio criteria, represented in Eq. (3.16).
Ratio Coefficients of Z-row
Coefficients of pivot row only forve co = ( efficients under non-basic variables) (3.16)
The above ratio is determined only for non-basic variables, which have negative coefficients in the 
pivot row. The variable offers the minimum ratio should be selected as an entering variable.
In Table 3.12(b), only three variables are non-basic (x x x d d d
1 2 3 , ,and ). Since all the coefficients in 
the pivot row under non-basic variables are negative and thus the ratio should be calculated for all. 
Let the ratio under non-basic variable xd
2 (= C2
/ a12) is minimum, and thus xd
2 is chosen as entering 
variable, as indicated in Table 3.12(c). The xd
2 column is the pivot column.
Step 4: The row transformation should be carried out using a similar method, as explained in the 
Primal Simplex algorithm.

3.6 CASE STUDY OF THE APPLICATION OF LPP IN OPTIMIZATION OF 
COAL TRANSPORTATION FROM MINE TO POWER PLANTS
The case study was carried out in a coal mining area in Indonesia. The area has a total of 17 active 
open-pit coal mines. A morphological condition of the study area is undulated, with the highest point 
at 325 m above mean sea level (AMSL) and the lowest point at 20 m at AMSL. In the mining lease 
area, several rivers divide the mining area from South to North. The coal deposits of the study area 
were formed during the Tertiary period. Different geological events, i.e., folds and faults, caused 
the undulating topography around the study area, which makes the area sensitive to landslides. The 
major geology structure of the area is dominated by folds that form solid anticlines and have a north￾east strike. The main overburden types are siltstone, mudstone, and sandstone. The inter-burden 
thickness is relatively constant. According to ASTM classification (American Society for Testing 
Material), the coal of the study area is categorized into High Volatile C Bituminous Coal with a cal￾orific value of 6,424.58–7,262.57 kcal/kg and weight of contents between 1.3–1.5 gr/cm3
.
This study used data from one of the active open-pits from the study area. Within the current pit, 
it is 12-mineable coal seams (Seam 1 to Seam 12). The average dip of the coal seams is 13.3º–14.9º. 
The quality of the coal in the study area is represented by four quality parameters: total moisture 
(TM), ash (ASH), total sulphur (TS), and calorific value (CV). Average quality parameters of all the 
12 seams for a specific production period (day) are presented in Table 3.14.
The mine is supplying coal to three neighbouring power plants. Each power plant has its capacity 
and coal quality requirements. Also, the mining company has long-term price contracts with each 
of the power plants, based on the quality requirements. The mine has the flexibility to send coal 
to the power plants from any coal seam as long as quality and quantity requirements are satisfied. 
However, there is limited production from each coal seam and different transportation costs involved 
for transporting coal from the coal seam to the power plant. Table 3.15 shows the daily coal produc￾tion from 12 coal seams and the coal prices from each coal seam based on their quality parameters.
Similarly, the transportation costs from the coal seam locations to the power plant locations are 
presented in Table 3.16. The quality and quantity limits for the three power plants are shown in 
Table 3.17.
Given these data in hand, the goal of the mining company is to allocate the specific amount 
of coal from different coal seams to different power plants to maximize the profit and minimize 
the transportation cost. The problem is a linear programming problem and can be solved using

The objective function for the proposed optimization model consists of two parts. Part I in the 
objective function represents the revenue generated by sending coals from seam s to power plant 
t. The goal here is to maximize Part I. Part II consists of total transportation costs from coal seams 
to power plants. So, this transportation cost needs to minimize. The overall objective function is a 
maximization problem, where the transportation cost (Part II) is subtracted from the total revenue 
(Part I) of the problem.

Several constraints need to satisfy for this optimization problem. The following are the set of

Constraint (1) signifies that the coal transported from a coal seam to power plants should be less 
than or equal to total daily production from the seam. Constraint (2) ensures total coal transported 
from coal seams to a power plant should be less than the maximum target coal requirement. It is 
noted here that the mining company and the power plan had a long-term contract where the plant 
is not willing to accept more than the total coal tonnage mentioned in Table 3.17. However, there 
is no lower limit restriction imposed in that contract. It means the mining company can decide not 
to send any coal to a specific power plan on a specific date. The reason for this flexibility is that the 
power plants also purchased coal from the other two companies. Although there is the flexibility 
of sending total daily coal to the power plants; however, power plants are very particular about the 
quality of the coal they are receiving. Constraints (3)–(5) ensure that average total sulfur, total mois￾ture, and ash content, respectively, in coal transported to a power plant should be less than or equal 
to the target total sulfur, total moisture, and ash content of the power plant. Constraint (6) ensures 
that the average calorific value in coal transported to a power plant should be greater than or equal to 
the target calorific value of the power plant. All three power plants want their coal quality should 
have an upper limit value for total moisture, total sulfur, and ash content and a lower limit for calor￾ific value. If a mining company fails to send the coal with that desired quality, the power plant will 
not accept that coal. So, the real challenge of the mining company is to optimize the coal transported 
from a specific seam to a specific plant such that the quality requirement is made and at the same 
time maximize the profit.
Given this problem set and the data, the optimization can optimally be solved using a simplex 
algorithm. The optimization problem can be solved using any available optimizer; however, CPLEX 
software (www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) is used for solving the problem. The linear pro￾gramming formulation was created using ZIMPL software (https://zimpl.zib.de/). Using ZIMPL 
and CPLEX to solve optimization problems is demonstrated in the later chapter in this book. It is 
noted here that the quality and quantity parameters from a coal seam for a specific day were obtained 
from long-range and subsequent short-range mine planning. The target coal quality and quantity 
parameters for the power plant were obtained from the annual contract agreement between the 
mining and power plants companies. An assumption was made here that coal quality and quantity 
parameters from the seam are known with full certainty. However, due to the geological uncertainty, 
these parameters can significantly be different from the obtained data from the long- and short-range 
planning. We understand the limitation of ignoring the uncertainty; however, the purpose of this 
case study is to show how linear programming can be used for solving real-case mining problems. 
For optimization under uncertainty, the reader can follow these literature (Paithankar et al., 2021; 
Lamghari and Dimitrakopoulos, 2012).
The optimum solution was achieved after creating the linear programming formulation of this 
problem using ZIMPL and solving it in CPLEX using dual simplex method. The objective function 
value is 4.35x105
, which is total revenue for selling coals to power plants minus total transportation 
cost (i.e., total profit) in the US dollar. The amount of materials sent from each coal seam to each 
power plant, the total amount of coal sent from coal seams, and unused coals in each coal seam are 
presented in Table 3.18. It was observed from the results that all produced coals from eight coal 
seams were transported to power plants. In four coal seams (Seam 2, 3, 7, and 10), there are some 
excess coals that were not transported to any power plants. Out of these four coal seams, no coal is 
being used from coal seam 3. It was also observed that in Plant 2 and 3, the full required coal quan￾tity was supplied; however, from plan 1, the amount sent was less than the upper limit of the required Linear programming for mining systems 95

capacity. As mentioned in the constraint, the plant only has the upper limit tonnage requirement; 
therefore, the solution doesn’t violate the constraints.
Exercise 3
Q1: An explosive company produces two types of commercial explosives, including E1 and 
E2. The unit revenues of E1 and E2 are US$7.5 per kg and US$8 per kg, respectively. Two 
types of raw materials, R1 and R2, are used in the manufacture of the two explosives. The 
daily availabilities of the two types of raw materials are 1500 kg and 50 kg, respectively. 
One kg of E1 uses 0.8 kg of R1 and 0.1 kg of R2, and 1 kg of E2 uses 0.9 kg of Rl and 
0.05 kg of R2.

b. Calculate the dual prices and feasibility ranges of R1 and R2.
c. The company is planning to purchase 400 kg of additional raw material of R1 with the 
cost of US$8 per kg. Is the additional purchase increase the revenue?
d. Determine the maximum recommended purchasing cost for R2.

e. US$13520]
Q2. A mining company produces ores of two grades (G1 and G2). G1 grade ore is directly 
saleable in the market, and G2 requires processing before sale. The production of 1 unit of 
G2 type ore requires twice as much resources as to produce 1 unit of G1 type of ore. If all 
the available resources are dedicated to producing G2 type ore alone, the mine can produce 
4000 tonnes per day. The demands for the two types are 1500 and 2000 tonnes per day 
respectively. The profit is US$30 per tonne and US$10 per tonne.
a. Calculate the optimal production of two types of ore that maximize the profit.

Q3. The ore produces in a Limestone mine are classified into two viz. G1 and G2. The CaO 
content of G1 types is > 45%, and that of G2 types is > 40%. A cement industry requires the 
limestone ore for cement manufacturing with CaO % to be more than the cut-off grade. The 
production of G1 type ore should not exceed 1200 tons per day. The production cost for G1 
type ore is US$25 per tonne and for G2 types is US$20 per tonne. The total production of 
the day has to be at least 2600 tonnes to meet the demand of the cement industry, and the 
production of G2 types should not exceed G1 type by more than 1000 tonnes. Determine 
the level of the daily production of G1 and G2 type ore for minimizing the production cost 
and the minimum supply grade percentage.

are deployed for the transportation of materials at the rate of 1200 tonnes per hour. The 
average cycle time is assumed to be 15 minutes for 40-tonne dump truck and 18 minutes 
for 60-tonne dump truck. The average diesel consumptions are 70 L/ hour and 90 L/hour, 
respectively, for a 40-tonne dump truck and 60-tonne dump truck. The overall diesel con￾sumption level is a maximum of 560 L/hour. Determine the minimum number of trucks

4 Transportation and 
assignment problems 
in mines
4.1 DEFINITION OF A TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM
The transportation problem applied to the mine system in which mineral is transported from mul￾tiple production points (referred to as source) to multiple consumers (referred to as destinations). 
In general, let there be n mines M1
, M2,…, Mn
 have S1
, S2,…, Sn
 unit of production capacity to be 
transported among m consumers, P1
, P2,…, Pm with D1
, D2,…, Dm unit of demand.
Let Cij be the costs of transportation of one unit of the material from mine i to destination j for 
each route. Suppose xij represents the units transported from mine i to destination j. The objective 
is to make an optimal transportation planning to minimize the total transportation cost satisfying 
production capacity and demand requirements. The transportation model can be mathematically 
represented as

And, x for all i and j ij ≥ 0
4.2 TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM
The transportation problem can be broadly classified into two types:
Balanced Transportation Problem: The problem is called a balanced transportation problem if 
the supply capacity by the mines is equal to the demand of consumers.
Thus, if the equation S D i i
n
j j
m
∑ ∑ = = = 1 1 holds true; the problem is a balanced transportation 
problem.
Example 4.1
The following example is used to demonstrate the formulation of the transportation model. The 
produced coals from three mines M1
, M2
, and M3
, are transported to three power plants P1
, P2
, and 
P3
. The distances from mines to the plants, along with the normal supply and demand capacities of 
mines and plants, are indicated below in Figure 4.1.100 Optimization techniques and their applications
100
In Figure 4.1, the sum of total supply from three mines (= = + + ∑ = Si i 1
3
4000 3000 4000) is 
equal to the sum of the total demand of three plants (= = + + ∑ = Dj j 1
3
2500 3500 4000), i.e., 11000. 
Therefore, the problem is a balanced transportation model.
Unbalanced Transportation Problem: The problem is called an unbalanced transportation 
problem if the supply capacity by the mines is not equal to the capacity consumed by the 
plants.
If the equation S D i i
n
j j
m
∑ ∑ = = ≠ 1 1 holds true; then, the problem is called an unbalanced transporta￾tion problem.
4.3 SOLUTION ALGORITHMS OF A TRANSPORTATION MODEL
The transportation model is perhaps the earliest application of linear programming in real-life 
problems. The solution algorithm is explained with the same problem, as explained in Example 4.1.
The data given in Figure 4.1 are represented in the standard transportation tableau, as shown in 
Table 4.1.
The above problem is a balanced transportation problem as the total supply capacity of mines is 
equal to the total demand of the plants.
Let xij is the amount of ore transported from mine i to processing plant j in a tonne.
dij represents the distance between mine i and power plant j in km.
Assuming the cost of transportation (including loading and unloading) of coal is US$1 per ton 
per km in each route. Therefore, the cost of transportation from mine i to power plant j = US$1*dij
per ton = US$ dij per tonne.
The objective is to make optimal allocation of ore from each mine to each plant in order to 
minimize the transportation cost. The linear programming model for this transportation problem is 
formulated as follows.

In this model, the decision variables, xij, represent the amount of coal to be transported from mine, 
i (i =1, 2, 3), to power plant, j (j = 1, 2, 3). The objective of the problem is to minimize the total trans￾portation cost of the system. The cost of the transportation for each individual path is represented by 
one term in the objective function. For example, the cost of transportation from M1 to P1 is given 
by the multiplication of tonnes of coal transported in the path (= x11) and the unit transportation cost 
(= US$150).
Constraints (1)–(3) represent the production constraints of three mines, and Constraints (4)–(6) 
represent the demand at three power plants, respectively. The production constraint indicates that the 
supply from individual mines to three processing plants (P1
, P2
, and P3
) should not exceed the pro￾duction capacity of the respective mine. The inequality (≤) sign indicates that the maximum amount 
transported from M1
, M2
, and M3
 should be at most 4000 tonnes, 3000 tonnes, and 4000 tonnes, 
respectively. Similarly, the demand constraint indicates that the coal receipt in the three power plants 
should be equal to the demand of the respective power plant.
The amount of coal transported from each mine to each plant is shown in Table 4.2. Each cell in 
the transportation table (Table 4.2) is assigned by a variable xij (i, j =1, 2, 3), representing the amount 
of coal transported from i
th
 mine to j
th power plant. Each cell also contains the unit (1 tonne) trans￾portation cost for that route. For example, in cell 11, the value 150 is the cost of transportation of 
1 tonne of coal from mine 1(M1) to plant 1 (P1). In Table 4.2, the last column and last row represent 
the production capacity of mines and demand value of plants, respectively.
The initial feasible solution of the transportation model can be found by three methods: the 
north-west corner method, the minimum cell cost method, and Vogel’s approximation method. 
There are two methods for obtaining an optimal solution of a transportation model. These are the

modified distribution method (also known as MODI) and the stepping stone method. Both the 
optimal solution methods offer the same solution of a typical transportation model irrespective using 
of either of the initial solution methods.
4.3.1  Initial basic feasible solution
4.3.1.1 The north-west corner method
This rule is a simple method for generating a basic feasible solution to the transportation problem. 
The solution starts from the north-west corner and approaches towards the south-east corner. The 
only variables required to obtain this type of solution are supply and demand and not the cost of 
transportation.
The steps of the north-west corner method are as follows:
Step 1: Allocate as much as possible to the cell in the upper left-hand corner, subject to the supply 
and demand constraints.
Step 2: Allocate as much as possible to the next adjacent feasible cell.
Step 3: Repeat step 2 until all demands are fulfilled, or supplies are exhausted.
In the north-west corner method, the first allocation is made to the cell in the upper left-hand 
corner of the tableau (i.e., the ‘north-west corner’ or cell 11). The allocation is based on the 
minimum supply and demand value corresponding to that cell. In Example 4.1, the amount of 
allocation made to cell 11 is 2500 tonnes, since this is the maximum demand of plant P1
, even 
though the supply capacity of M1 is 4000 tonnes. We next allocate to a cell adjacent to cell 11, 
in this case, either cell 21 or cell 12. However, cell 21 no longer represents a feasible alloca￾tion because the demand for coal at P1
 (i.e., 2500 tons) has already been allocated. Thus, cell 
12 represents the only feasible alternative, which needs to allocate next. The amount allocated 
to cell 12 is the minimum of remaining supply available at M1 (=4000–2500=1500 tons) and 
demand at P2 (=3500 tonnes). Similarly, the allocation process continues till all the supply and 
demand constraints are fulfilled. The steps involved in allocating all the cells using north-west 
corner method are demonstrated below.
Step I: x11 = min (S1
, D1
) = D1
 = 2500; i.e. if D1
 ≤ S1
; xi1 = 0 [i >1]
Step II: x12 = min (S1
 – D1
, D2
) = (1500, 3500) = S1
 – D1
 = 1500; thus x1j = 0 [j >2]
Step III: x22 = min [D2
 – (S1
 – D1
), S2
)] = (2000, 3000) = 200; xi2 = 0 [i > 2]
Step IV: x23 = min [S2
 – {D2
 – (S1
- D1
)}, D3
] = (1000, 5000) = 1000
Step V: x33 = min [[D3
 – [S2
 – {D2
 – (S1
 – D1
)], S3
] = 4000

The allocation made to each cell is shown in Table 4.3.
Therefore, the cost of transportation = 150*2500 + 70*1500 + 10*2000 + 80*1000 + 60*4000
= $8, 20,000
4.3.1.2 Matrix minimum method
This is an efficient method for finding the initial basic feasible solution to a transportation problem. 
The steps involved in the matrix minimum method is demonstrated below:
Step 1: This method solution starts with searching the cell of minimum cost and allocating the 
units as maximum as possible. If there are multiple minima, say Cmn (cost of cell mn) = Cpq
(cost of cell pq), the allocation is made to lower-order cells. That is, if there are two or more 
minimum costs, then we should have to select the cell corresponding to the lower row number. 
If they appear in the same row; we should select the cell corresponding to the lower column 
number.
Step 2: Search the next minimum cost cell among all feasible cells and allocate as maximum as 
possible, which satisfies the demand and supply constraints.
Step 3: The process of Step 2 continues until all the supply and demand constraints are fulfilled.
The steps involved in allocating the materials in Example 4.1 is demonstrated below:
Step I: Minimum cost cell is 22 (C22=10). Thus, the first allocation made to cell 22, which is equal 
to x22 = min(S2
, D2
) = 3000; x2j = 0 [j ≠ 2].
Step II: The next minimum cost cell is 32 (C32 = 30). Therefore, the next allocation is made to cell 
32, which is equal to x32 = min(D2
 – S2
, S3
) = 500; xi2 = 0 [i ≠ 2, 3].
Step III: The next minimum cost cell is 31 and 33 both (C31 = C33 = 30) and thus the lower order 
cell (31) is chosen to allocate. Therefore, the next allocation is made to cell 31, which is equal 
to x31 = min[S3
 – (D2
 – S2
), D1
) = min(3500, 2500) = 2500; xi1 = 0 [i ≠ 3].
Step IV: The next minimum cost cell is 33 (C33 = 60). Therefore, the next allocation is made to 
cell 33, which is equal to x33 = min[D3
, S3
 – D1
 – (D2
 – S2
)] = 1000.
Step V: The next minimum cost cell is 13 (C13 = 150). Therefore, the next allocation is made to 
cell 13, which is equal to x13 = min(D3
 – {S3
 – D1
 – (D2
 – S2
)}, S1
) = 4000.

The solution will proceed in the same way. The initial solution obtained using the matrix minimum 
method is shown in Table 4.4.
Therefore, cost of transportation = 60*2500 + 10*3000 + 30*500 + 150*4000 + 60*1000 
= $8,55,000
4.3.1.3 Vogel Approximation Method (VAM)
The third method for determining an initial solution, Vogel’s approximation model (also called 
VAM), is based on the concept of penalty cost or regret. This method requires many calculations for 
finding the initial basic feasible solution to the transportation problem. This method, however, usu￾ally yields a starting solution that is very close, if not equal, to the optimum solution.
The steps of Vogel’s approximation method are as follows:
Step 1: In the first step, the penalty cost for each row and column should be determined by 
subtracting the lowest cell cost in the row or column from the next lowest cell cost in the same 
row or column. Mathematically, it can be represented as:
Penalty = Minimum cost of any row N– ext minimum cost of any row
= Minimum cost of any column Next minimum cost of any column–
Step 2: Consider the row or column, which has the highest penalty cost. If there is two highest 
penalty cost found, break the ties by arbitrarily choosing any of them.
Step 3: Allocate as maximum as possible to the feasible cell with the lowest transportation cost 
in the row or column with the highest penalty cost.
Step 4: Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 until all demand and supply requirements have been met.
The allocation made in using the above-described algorithm for Example 4.1 is demonstrated 
below:
Step I: In the first step, the maximum penalty found in M1 (=80), i.e., C11 – C12, and thus the first 
allocation made to cell C12. The maximum possible allocation to cell 12 is Min (S1
, D2
), which 
is equal to 3500 tonnes. This is indicated in Table 4.5. Since the demand of plant P2 is fulfilled,

no further allocation is possible in the P2 column. Thus, the allocations in all the other cells in 
the P2 column are zero. In the next step, the P2 column should be eliminated before penalty 
calculation.
Step II: The revised table after the first allocation is shown in Table 4.6. The penalty values for 
each row and column of the revised table are determined. This time the maximum penalty is 
also observed in the M2 row, and thus the allocation should be made to cell 12. The maximum 
possible allocation to cell 12 is Min (S2
, D2
), which is equal to 2500 tonne. The allocation made 
in Step II is shown in Table 4.6. After allocating cell 12, the demand of plant P1 is fulfilled, 
and thus no further allocation is possible in the P1 column. Thus, the allocations in all the

other cells in the P1 column are zero. In the next step, P1 should be eliminated before penalty 
calculation.
Step III: The revised table after the second allocation is shown in Table 4.7. In Table 4.7, only 
one column (P3) is available. Thus, the allocation can be directly made from low-cost to high￾cost cells, as the same sequence will offer the highest penalty values. In P3 Column, the lowest 
cost cell is 33, and thus allocation should be made to cell 33. The maximum possible alloca￾tion to cell 33 is Min(S3
, D3
), which is equal to 4000 tonnes. The allocation made in Step III is 
shown in Table 4.7. After allocating cell 33, the supply of mine M3 is exhausted, and thus no 
further allocation is possible in the M3 row. In the next step, the M3 row should be eliminated 
before penalty calculation.
Step IV: The revised table after the second allocation is shown in Table 4.8. In Table 4.8, only 
one column (P3) and two rows are available. Thus, the allocation can be directly made from

low-cost to high-cost cells. In Table 4.8, the lowest cost cell is 23, and thus allocation should 
be made to cell 23. The maximum possible allocation to cell 23 is Min (D3
–S3
, S2 – D1
), which 
is equal to 500 tonnes.
Step V: After allocating cell 23, the remaining cell (13) should be allocated with the balance 
amount.
The solution obtained using the VAM method is shown in Table 4.9.
Therefore, cost of transportation = 70*3500 + 150*500 +50*2500 + 80*500 + 60*4000
= $7, 25,000/-
4.3.2  Determination of optimal solution
Once any of the previous three methods determine an initial basic feasible solution, the next step is 
to solve the optimal solution model to minimize the transportation cost. There are two basic solution 
methods: the modified distribution method (MODI) and the stepping stone solution method.
4.3.2.1 The Modified Distribution method
The initial solution obtained by the north-west corner method is chosen as the starting solution for 
explaining the MODI method. The solution derived from the north-west corner method is shown 
below in transportation Table 4.10.
The corresponding cost of transportation obtained for the above allocation is US$8,20,000.
It is noted here that non-basic cells/variables are assigned a zero value, and all other variables/
cells with a non-zero assignment are basic cells. In the above initial solution, x11, x12, x22, x23, and x33
are basic variables and x13, x21, x31, and x32 are non-basic variables.
The iterative steps of the MODI method are as follows:
Step I: Identify the entering variable from the non-basic variables using the optimality condition, 
as used in the simplex method. If the current allocation satisfies the optimal condition, stop the 
iteration; otherwise, go to step II.
Step II: Identify the leaving variable using the feasibility condition, as used in the simplex 
method. Change the basis, and Go to Step I.

towards empty cells leads to a higher transportation cost. To start the iterative algorithm, the 
following condition should be fulfilled in the initial solution.
m (= number of rows) + n (=number of columns) – 1 = Number of cells with allocations
In this case, the number of allocations in the north-west corner method is 5, which is equal to the 
desired number of allocations (= 3 + 3 – 1). Thus, an iterative process can start.
If the number of allocations in the initial basic solution is less than (m + n – 1), the problem 
has a degenerate solution. In that case, a non-basic cell (empty cell) with the lowest cost should be 
considered a basic cell with zero allocation to start the iterative algorithm.
The selection of entering variables from the current non-basic cells (which have zero allocations) 
is computed using the method of multipliers. In this method, the multipliers Ui
 and Vj
 are considered 
respective to the i
th row and j
th column, as shown in Table 4.11.
For each current basic variable xij, these multipliers satisfy the following equations:
Ui + Vj
 = Cij
In the above equation, Cij indicates the transportation cost from i
th source to j
th destination.
The number of cells that have positive allocations in the initial basic solution is 5 (x11, x12, x22, x23, 
x33), and thus the number of basic variables is 5. Now there are five equations with six unknowns 
(U1
 to U3
, and V1
 to V3
). To solve these equations, it is necessary to assign a zero value to any one 
of the unknowns. In this case, U1
 is assigned a zero value. After assigning U1
 to 0, the remaining 
variables’ values can be calculated, as shown below:

In the next step, the optimal allocation is examined using the Kij value for each non-basic variable 
xij. The value of Kij is determined from Ui
 and Vj
 using the following equation
Kij = Ui
 + Vj
 – Cij
The Kij value of all four non-basic cells is calculated, as presented here:
Non-basic variables Kij = Ui
 + Vj
 –Cij
x13 K13 = U1
 + V3
 – C13 = 0 + 140 – 150 = –10
x21 K21 = U2 + V1 – C21 = –60 + 150 – 50 = 40
x31 K31 = U3
 + V1
 – C31 = –80 + 150 – 60 = 10
x32 K32 = U3
 + V2
 – C32 = –90 + 70 – 30 = –50
For optimality, the value of Kij for all the non-basic cells should be negative or zero. If not, iden￾tify the entering cell based on the highest positive value and follow the same process. In this case, 
all Kij values are not negative and zero, and the highest positive value is found for cell 21,
 (=40); 
thus cell 21 is the entering variable. Once the entering variable is identified, the leaving variable 
needs to be identified to replace in the basis. To maintain the supply and demand balance, a cycling 
shifting is done, as shown in Table 4.12. The cycle should form by considering only basic variables, 
including the basic entering variable in such a way that it does not violate any of the demand or 
supply constraints.
Let the number of units allocated to cell x21 = θ (non-negative value). Note, variable x21 is the 
entering variable into the basis.
It should be noted that the value of θ should be chosen in such a way that no decision vari￾able becomes negative. Thus, the maximum possible value of θ can be determined from the non￾negativity constraints, derived from Table 4.12, as
2500 0 2000 0 − ≥ θ θ , – and ≥
From the above two equations, the maximum possible value of θ is 2000. That is, the maximum 
allocation can be done to new basic cell x21 is 2000. After cycling shifting of allocation, the cell

x22 becomes zero, and thus the same is chosen as departing variable. The variable x21 is now a non￾basic variable, and x22 is a basic variable.
 The revised transportation tableau after the first iteration 
is represented in Table 4.13.
Therefore, the revised cost of transportation after first iteration = 150*500 + 70*3500 + 50*2000 
+ 80*1000 + 60*4000 = US$7, 40,000
The basic cells are now x22, x13, x31, and x32. This is the end of the first iteration. The optimality 
condition of the current solution is calculated by computing U1
 to U3
, V1
 to V3

variables, and Kij values for non-basic variables. First, the U1

The Kij value is still positive for cell 13, and thus optimality is not reached. In this case, the 
highest positive value is found for x13, and thus x13 is the entering variable. Let the allocation made to 
entering variable (x13) is θ. To maintain the supply and demand balance, a cycling shifting is done, 
as shown in Table 4.14.
The value of θ can be determined from the non-negativity constraints, derived from 
Table 4.14, as
500 0 1000 0 − ≥ θ θ and, − ≥
From the above two equations, the maximum value of θ is 500. The revised allocation is shown in 
transportation Table 4.15.
TABLE 4.14

112
Therefore, the revised cost of transportation = 70*3500 + 150*500 + 50*2500 + 80*500 +
60*4000 = US$ 7, 25,000
That is, the transportation cost is decreased in the subsequent iteration.
After cycling shifting of allocation, x11 becomes 0, and thus it is now a non-basic variable along 
with the cells x22, x31, and x32. After identifying basic and non-basic variables, the optimality criterion 
is tested, and the results are presented here:

In this case, all the Kij are non-positive, and thus optimality has been reached. No further iteration 
is required. Therefore, the allocation shown in transportation Table 4.15 represents an optimal one. 
The optimal cost of transportation is US$ 7,25,000.

4.3.2.2 Stepping Stone Method
The Stepping Stone Method is used to obtain the optimal solution of a transportation problem from 
the initial feasible solution, which is determined by using any of the three methods like a north￾west corner, matrix minimum method, or Vogel’s approximation method. Thus, the stepping stone 
method is a procedure for finding the potential of any non-basic variables (empty cells) in terms of 
the objective function. In this method, the effect of one-unit allocation to the empty or non-basic 
cells on the transportation cost is examined to identify the optimal solution.
Contrary to the MODI method, where only one closed path for the non-basic cell with the highest 
opportunity cost is drawn, the stepping stone method requires drawing as many closed paths as equal 
to the non-basic cells for their evaluation.
The steps involved in the stepping stone method are demonstrated with the same problem, as 
given in Example 4.1.
The initial basic feasible solution derived using the north-west corner method for the problem is 
considered for obtaining the optimal solution using the stepping stone method. The allocations made 
using the north-west corner method are shown in Table 4.16.
The first step in the stepping stone method is to evaluate these non-basic cells by examining 
whether their allocation would reduce transportation costs. If we find such a route, then we will allo￾cate as much as possible to it. In this case, the basic cells are 11, 12, 22, 23, and 33, and non-basic 
cells are 13, 21, 31, and 32.
The change in transportation cost with unit allocations to each non-basic cell should be examined 
one by one. The cell, which offers maximum cost reduction, should be selected as an entering vari￾able. If the cost is not reduced with allocation made to either of the non-basic cells, the existing 
allocation is optimal. First, let us consider allocating one tonne of material to cell 13. If one tonne 
is allocated to cell 13, the cost will be increased by Rs.150, which is equal to the transportation cost 
for cell 13. However, by allocating one ton to cell 13, a similar amount should be deducted from any 
allocated or basic cell in the same row and in the same column to maintain the supply and demand 
constraints. Thus, a cyclic shifting of one-unit coal should be done, as shown in Table 4.16. The 
same should be examined for all other non-basic cells (21, 31, and 32).
TABLE 4.16
Initial solution derived using north-west corner method114 Optimization techniques and their applications
114
First, we always start with a non-basic cell and form a closed path using basic cells. In developing 
the path, it is possible to skip over both basic and non-basic cells. In any row or column, there can 
be only one addition and one subtraction.
Path 1 for cell 13: 13 → 23→22→12 = 150 – 80 + 10 – 70 = 10
Path 2 for cell 21: 21→ 11 → 12 → 22 = 50 – 150 + 70 – 10 = –40
Path 3 for cell 31: 31→ 11→12→22→23→33 = 60 – 150 + 70 – 10 + 80 – 60 = –10
Path 4 for cell 32: 32→22→23→33 = 30 – 10 + 80 – 60 = 40
In the above optimality check, the allocation is optimal provided all the paths show non-negative 
values. A negative value in any of the paths indicates that the initial solution is not optimal because 
a lower cost can be achieved by allocating to a cell with a negative value. Our goal is to determine 
the cell or entering ‘variable’ that will reduce transportation costs the most. Thus, the cell which is 
having the maximum negative value will be the entering cell or new basic cell. In this case, path two 
is showing negative value solely, and thus cell 21 is the entering variable, as shown in Table 4.17.
Let the amount of allocation made to cell 21 is θ. The value of θ can be determined in a 
similar method as used in the MODI method. The non-negativity constraints can be derived from 
Table 4.17, as
2500 0 2000 0 − ≥ θ θ and, − ≥
From the above two constraints, the maximum possible value of θ is 2000. The revised allocation is 
shown in transportation Table 4.18.
After the first iteration, the allocation in cell 22 is 0, and thus cell 22 becomes a non-basic cell 
along with cells 13, 31, and 32. In a similar way, as explained in an earlier iteration, the optimality 
is checked for the current allocation.
Path 1 for cell 13: 13 → 23 → 21 → 11 = 150 – 80 + 50 – 150 = –30
Path 2 for cell 22: 22 → 21 → 11 → 12 = 10 – 50 + 150 – 70 = 40
Path 3 for cell 31: 31 → 33 → 23 → 21 = 60 – 60 + 80 – 50 = 20
Path 4 for cell 32: 32 → 33 → 23 → 21 → 11 → 12 = 30 – 60 + 80 – 50 + 150 – 70 = 80
TABLE 4.17
Transportation tableau showing the entering and departing cellsTransportation and assignment problems in mines 115
115
In the above optimality check, a negative value still exists for cell 13 and thus the current allocation 
is not optimal. Thus, cell 13 is the entering cell, as shown in Table 4.19. Let the amount of allocation 
made to cell 13 is θ. The value of θ can be determined from the non-negativity constraints, derived 
from Table 4.19, as
500 0 1000 0 −≥ −≥ θ θ , and
From the above two constraints, the maximum value of θ = 500. The revised allocation after the 
second iteration is shown in transportation Table 4.20.
After the second iteration, the allocation in cell 22 is 0, and thus cell 22 is now a non-basic vari￾able along with cells 11, 31, and 32. Again, the optimality condition is checked for the current allo￾cation by examining the paths for all the non-basic cells.

Revised allocation after the first iteration

116
Path 1 for cell 11: 11 → 13 → 23 → 21 = 150 – 150 + 80 – 50 = 30
Path 2 for cell 22: 22 → 12 → 13 → 23 = 10 – 70 + 150 – 80 = 10
Path 3 for cell 31: 31 → 21 → 23 → 33 = 60 – 50 + 80 – 60 = 30
Path 4 for cell 32: 32 → 12 → 13 → 33 = 30 – 70 + 150 – 60 = 50
Since no path exhibits a negative value, this indicates that the current allocation has reached the opti￾mality. That is, there is no scope for a further reduction in the cost.
Thus, the optimal transportation cost is = 70*3500 + 150*500 + 50*2500 + 80*500 + 60*4000
= US$7, 25,000/-
4.3.3  Solution algorithm of an unbalanced transportation model
When the supply and demand are unequal, the transportation model is called the unbalanced trans￾portation model. The unbalanced transportation model needs to be balanced first before applying the 
above-mentioned algorithms. In this case, we need to add a dummy row (when demand is greater 
than the supply) or a dummy column (when supply is greater than the demand) and assign zero cost 
to each cell. After this operation, the same methods can be followed for solving the problems. The 
following two cases demonstrate the procedure of handling the unbalanced transportation problem.
Case 1: Supply > demand
The case is demonstrated using data shown in Example 4.2. In this example, similar to the previous 
example, M1
 to M3
 represents three mines, and P1
 to P3
 represents three power plants. The total supply 
from mines is 11,000 (= 4000 +3000 + 4000 = 11000), and the total demand of the plants is 10,000 (=
2500 +3500 + 4000 = 10000). We can see, in this case, the supply is greater than the demand; therefore, 
the problem is an unbalanced transportation problem. A dummy plant (P4
) needs to be added to the 
solution table to make the problem a balanced transportation problem. The cost of transportation from 
each of the mines to the dummy plant is assumed to be zero. The balanced problem after modification 
is represented in Table 4.21. We can also note here that the demand of the dummy plant (D4
) is added in 
the table with a demand of 1000 (=11000 – 10000) to balance the table. Now, this problem can be solved 
using the two-step approach as discussed in the previous section.

Case 2: Supply < demand
The case is demonstrated using data shown in Example 4.3. In this example, similar to the previous 
example, M1
 to M3
 represents three mines, and P1
 to P3
 represents three power plants. The total 
supply from mines in 11,000 (= 4000 + 3000 + 4000 = 11000), and the total demand of the plants 
is 12,000 (= 2500 + 3500 + 6000 = 12000). In this case, supply < demand; therefore, a dummy row 
needs to be added to make it balance. The cost of transportation from each of the dummy mines to 
each plant is assumed to be zero. The balanced problem is represented in Table 4.22. We can also 
note here that the supply from the dummy mine (M4
) is added to the table with a supply of 1000

(=12000 – 11000) to balance the table. Now, this problem can be solved using the two-step approach 
as discussed in the previous section.
Once the problem is balanced, a similar algorithm can be applied to solve the problems.
4.3.4  Solution algorithm of a transportation model with prohibited routes
Sometimes one or more of the routes in the transportation model are prohibited. For example, a 
particular mine cannot supply materials to a particular plant. When this situation occurs, we must 
make sure that no resources in the optimal solution are allocated to the cell representing this route. 
It should be noted that assigning a high relative cost (or a coefficient of M) to a cell will ensure that 
the variable will never be allocated on the final solution. This same principle can be used in a trans￾portation model for the prohibited routes. An infinitely large value of M should be assigned as the 
transportation costs to all the cells that represent the prohibited routes. Thus, when the prohibited 
cells are evaluated, they will always contain a large positive cost change of M, which will keep it 
from being selected as an entering variable.
The algorithm is demonstrated to the same problem, as explained in Example 4.1, with a 
small change in data. Suppose transportation from Mine C to Plant 3 is prohibited. In that case, 
the cost of transportation from mine C to plant 3 is assigned as M. The revised transportation 
problem is represented in Table 4.23. M is a big positive number relative to all other transporta￾tion costs.
The same algorithms for obtaining the initial basic feasible solution (north-west corner method or 
matrix minimum method or VAM method) and optimal solution (MODI or Stepping stone method) 
can be applied. The optimal solution of the problem is shown in Table 4.24.
It can be observed from Table 4.24 that no material is allocated to prohibited routes (M3 to P3) 
due to higher transportation costs.
The optimal cost of transportation is
= 70 * 2000 + 150 * 2000 + 80 * 3000 + 60 * 2500 + 30 * 1500 = US$8, 75,000
The optimal transportation cost in case of prohibited routes should be always equal or greater than 
the non-prohibited route transportation problems.

4.3.5  Solution algorithm for degeneracy problem
If the degeneracy exists in the initial feasible solution, a zero allocation should be made to a non￾basic cell with the minimum transportation cost. Once the degeneracy problem is removed, the same 
algorithms (MODI or stepping stone method) can be applied to obtain the optimal solution.
4.4 ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM
The purpose of the assignment problem is to an optimal assignment of a certain number of resources 
(e.g., workers, machines, etc.) intended for specific jobs. The assignment problem can be represented 
through binary integer programming in which the goal of the objective function is to minimize the 
cost or time of the given assignment.
Suppose m jobs are to be assigned to n workers. Each worker can do each job at a specific dur￾ation with different efficiency. Let Cij is the cost or time for assigning the resource i to job j. The 
problem is to find an optimal assignment (which job should be assigned to which worker one-to-one 
basis) so that the total cost or time of performing all jobs is minimal.

The model represents a special form of the linear programming model, known as 0-1 programming 
or binary integer linear programming. The objective function represents the total cost or time of 
performing all the jobs. The job constraints indicate that only one job is done by i
th
 resource (i = 1, 
2,…,m). Similarly, the resource constraint indicates that only one worker should be assigned to j
th
job (j = 1, 2,…,n).
An assignment problem can be categorized as balanced or unbalanced. For example, if the 
number of jobs (m) is equal to the number of resources (n), the problem is said to be a balanced 
assignment problem. On the other hand, if the number of jobs (m) does not equal to the number of 
resources (n); the problem is an unbalanced assignment problem.
In order to solve the assignment problem, the number of resources has to be equal to the number 
of jobs (m = n). The importance of the algorithm is that a large number of jobs can be assigned to 
different resources in order to minimize the cost or time. This special form of assignment problem 
can be solved efficiently using the Hungarian Assignment Method (HAM) method. The solution 
strategies of the general-purpose integer programming are discussed in Chapter 5.
4.4.1  The Hungarian Assignment Method (HAM)
The HAM method was first developed by Harold W. Kuhn in 1955. The HAM algorithm is largely 
based on the earlier works of two Hungarian mathematicians (Dénes Kőnig and Jenő Egerváry) and 
thus the name suggested as ‘Hungarian method’. The Hungarian assignment method provides an 
optimal assignment for minimizing the cost or resources without examining every feasible solution. 
In this method, a matrix of opportunity cost is derived from the given cost/time matrix. Opportunity 
cost represents the relative penalties associated with assigning jobs to any resource/worker in com￾parison to assigning to best or least cost/resources. The detailed algorithm is explained below.
The method can be applied to a balanced assignment problem. If n resources or workers are 
needed for completing n jobs, the efficiency/cost matrix can be presented as:Transportation and assignment problems in mines 121

In the above matrix, Cij represents the cost or time that i
th resource is assigned by j
th job. The 
optimal assignment represents the solution in which the right worker/resource is assigned by a spe￾cific job to ensure that total completion cost/time is minimal.
HAM Algorithm
Step 1: Identify the lowest cost/time element in each row of the cost/time matrix and subtract the 
lowest cost/time from each element of the respective row. This leads to offer at least one zero 
in each row of the new matrix, called the Reduced cost matrix.
Step 2: In the Reduced cost matrix, derived in Step 1, identify the smallest element in each 
column and subtract from every element in the respective column. The process offers at least 
one zero in each row and column of the new Reduced cost matrix.
Step 3: Cover all the ‘Zero’ elements in the new Reduced cost matrix by drawing the least number 
of horizontal and vertical lines. If the number of lines drawn is equal to n (the number of rows/
columns), the optimal assignment is possible and proceed to step 6; else, go to step 4.
Step 4: Identify the lowest uncovered (by the lines) cost/time element, subtract this lowest 
element from all uncovered elements, and add this element to each value located at the inter￾section of any two lines.
Step 5: Steps 3 and 4 should repeat until the condition for optimal assignment mentioned in Step 
3 is fulfilled.
Step 6: Assign the job to resource/worker corresponds to ‘Zero’ elements.
(a) Identify the rows and columns which contain only one ‘Zero’ element. Assign the job to 
the resource/worker corresponding to this element. Strike out the ‘Zeros’, if any, in the 
column or row corresponding to the element.
(b) If there is no row or column with a single ‘Zero’ left, then identify a row/column with 
multiple zero elements and choose any zero element cells arbitrarily for assigning the 
jobs. Strike out the remaining zeros in the selected column or row.
(c) Steps (a) and (b) should be repeated until all assignments are made.
Step 7: Calculate the total completion cost/time with reference to the original cost/time 
matrix table.
The steps involved in the HAM method are illustrated using Example 4.4.
Example 4.4
In an underground mine, five types of jobs have to be assigned to five operators. Each operator takes 
a different time period to complete different jobs, as shown in below Table 4.25. Any job can be 
assigned to any operator. An operator is assigned by a single job only. Find an optimum allocation 
of jobs in order to complete in minimum time.122 Optimization techniques and their applications
122
Solution
Step 1: Locate the shortest time, or smallest cost element in each row of the efficiency or cost 
matrix, as indicated in Table 4.26. Now subtract this smallest element from each element in 
that row. Let Pi
 be the minimum cost associated with i
th row. The reduced cost matrix is shown 
in Table 4.27.
Step 2: Locate the smallest cost element in each column in the above-reduced efficiency matrix, 
as shown in Table 4.27. Now subtract this smallest element from each element in that column. 
Let Qj
 be the minimum costs of j
th column.
Step 3: Draw the minimum number of lines covering all zero elements in the reduced efficiency 
or cost matrix, as shown in Table 4.28.
The minimum number of lines required to cover the zero elements is 5, equal to the number 
of rows or columns. Thus, a unique optimal assignment is possible. In the reduced cost matrix, 
the locations of the zero entries allow assigning unique allocations, as shown in Table 4.28. If the

123
number of lines needed to cover all the zero element is less than the number of rows or columns, 
then one additional step is needed. This is explained with the same example with modified data, as 
shown in Example 4.5.
To assign the jobs to the worker, first, identify the row and column with a unique zero cell. In 
column A, only one zero elements exist, and hence job A should be assigned to worker W5. Once 
W5 is assigned by job A, the same job cannot be assigned to another, and W5 should not be assigned 
by any other job. Thus, all the zero elements located in row W5 and column A should be crossed. In 
a similar way, other jobs can be assigned, as indicated in Table 4.29.
The optimal assignment for minimizing the time is
W1->B; W2 -> E; W3 -> D; W4 -> C; W5 -> A
Therefore, the time of completion of the jobs = 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 31

Example 4.5
In Example 4.4, if the time taken to complete different jobs is modified, as shown in Table 4.30, 
determine the optimum allocation of jobs to complete in minimum time.
Step 1: Subtract this smallest element from each element in the corresponding row. The reduced 
efficiency matrix is shown in Table 4.31.
Step 2: Subtract this smallest element from each element in the corresponding column of the 
reduced efficiency or cost matrix (Table 4.31). The resultant matrix is shown in Table 4.32.
Step 3: Draw the minimum number of lines to cover all zero elements in Table 4.32. The numbers 
of horizontal and vertical lines needed to cover all the zeros are shown in Table 4.33.
The minimum number of lines required to cover the zero elements is 4, which is less than the 
number of rows or number of columns. Therefore, the locations of the zero entries in Table 4.33 do

not allow assigning unique jobs to the workers. That is, a unique assignment cannot be performed, 
and hence an additional step (Step 4 and 5 of the algorithm) need to be performed.
Step 4: Select the smallest uncovered (which are not lay on the lines) element. In this case, the 
smallest uncovered element is 1, as shown in Table 4.33. The reduced matrix after subtracting 
‘1’ from all uncovered elements, including itself, and add this element to each value located at 
the intersection of any two lines is shown in Table 4.34.
Go to Step 3: After obtaining the reduced cost matrix, Step 3 needs to be repeated. Draw the 
minimum number of lines to cover all zero elements in Table 4.34. The numbers of horizontal 
and vertical lines needed to cover all the zeros are shown in Table 4.34.
Now the minimum number of lines required to cover the zero elements is 5, equal to the number 
of rows or number of columns. Therefore, unique optimal assignment can be done. As discussed 
above, if the criterion is not satisfied after this step, similar iterative operations need to be performed. 
The unique assignment of jobs to a worker is indicated in Table 4.35.

W1 and W5 have zero elements corresponding to both tasks A and B, and thus assigning either 
of the tasks A or B to W1 or W5 offers the same cost or time. This indicates an alternative solution 
exists for the problem. The alternative solution is shown in Table 4.36.
Optimal Assignment for minimizing the cost/time is
W1 -> A; W2 -> D; W3 -> E; W4 -> C; W5 -> B
Cost of assignment = 6 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 9 = 37
The optimal assignment for minimizing the time is
W1 -> B; W2 -> D; W3 -> E; W4 -> C; W5 -> A
Cost of assignment = 5 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 10 = 37
Corollary I: In case of unbalanced assignment problems, a dummy column/row, whichever is 
smaller in number, is inserted with zeros as the cost or time elements. The solution strategies 
for the unbalanced assignment problem are demonstrated with a new problem, as shown in 
Example 4.7.
Example 4.7
A mine manager has to assign five types of jobs to 4 contractors. Each contractor has the capability 
to complete each task but charges different costs in US$ (x103
), as shown in Table 4.37. Any job can 
be assigned to any contractor but not more than one. Find an optimum allocation of jobs in order to 
complete them at a minimum cost.
Solution
The problem is an unbalanced assignment problem, as the number of rows and columns are not 
equal. Thus, the problem should be converted into a balanced assignment problem by adding a 
dummy row before applying the HAM algorithm.
In this case, the number of rows (contractor) is less than the number of columns (jobs). Therefore, 
a dummy row (contractor C5) with a cost equal to ‘Zero’ is added, as indicated in Table 4.38. For 
contractor C5, the cost of completing job J1 to J5 (e.g., C51 to C55) is all set to 0.

After balancing the assignment problem, the same algorithm (HAM) can be applied for optimal 
assignment. The optimal assignment result is shown in Table 4.39.
The optimal assignment is
C1 -> J2; C2 -> J4; C3 -> J5; C4 -> J3; C5 -> J1
Cost of job completion = US$ (18 + 12 + 16 + 20 + 0) *1000 = US$56,000
Corollary II: If any specific job cannot be assigned to one or more workers or a worker cannot 
perform a job, the nature of the problem is said to be a constrained assignment problem. To 
solve this type of problem, the costs of performing the job by such resources or workers are 
assumed to be extremely large (M). The constrained assignment problem is explained with 
Example 4.8.
Example 4.8
A mine manager has to assign 4 tasks to 4 workers. The time taken in minutes by each worker to 
finish each task is shown in Table 4.40. Any task can be assigned to any worker but not more than 
one with the exception that T4 cannot be assigned to W2. Find an optimum allocation of tasks in 
order to complete them in a minimum time.
Solution
In this case, T4 cannot be assigned to W2, and the corresponding cell (24) should be assigned a large 
value, M, as shown in Table 4.41. If there are more than one restricted cell, all should be assigned 
with M. In this way; the restricted cell will automatically not be selected for the assignment. After 
this, the algorithm (HAM) can be applied to make the optimal assignment.
The optimal assignment of the different tasks to workers is shown in Table 4.42.
The optimal assignment is
W1-T2; W2-T3; W3-T1; W4-T4
Cost of completion of the jobs = (180 + 210 + 200 + 160) =. 750 minutes
That is, the minimum time required to complete all the jobs by four workers is 750 minutes.

4.5 CASE STUDY ON THE APPLICATION OF TRANSPORTATION MODEL IN 
MINING SYSTEM
This case study is presented using the data from the largest iron mining company in India. The com￾pany has three iron ore mines (Mine A, Mine B, and Mines C), which are located in the same region. 
For confidential agreement, we are not disclosing the names and locations of the mines. Each mine 
has three working faces from where the daily iron ore production has been done. The production 
capacity of Mine A, Mine B, and Mine C is 10,000 tonnes/day, 6000 tonnes/day, and 4000 tonnes/
day, respectively. The production from three faces of Mine A is 4000 tonnes/day, 3000 tonnes/day, 
3000 tonnes/day respectively. Similarly, the production from three faces of Mine B is 2500 tonnes/
day, 2000 tonnes/day, 1500 tonnes/day, respectively. The production from three faces of Mine C 
is 1500 tonnes/day, 1500 tonnes/day, 1000 tonnes/day, respectively. Mine A has two crushing/
screening plants, and Mine B and Mine C both have single crushing/ screening plant. The processing 
capacity of two crushing/screening plants located in MINE A is 7000 tonnes/day and 5000 tonnes/
day, respectively. The crushing/screening plants located at Mine B and Mine C, have 7000 tonnes/
day and 5000 tonnes/day, respectively. Each mine has two stockpiles designated for supplying ores 
to steel plants through trucks and railways, respectively. The ores produced from three mines are 
solely supplied to six steel plants located in the same region. The demand of ores of six steel plants 
are 6000 tonne/day, 4000 tonne/day, 3000 tonne/day, 3000 tonne/day, 2000 tonne/day, 1000 tonne/

day, and 1000 tonne/day, respectively. The distances from each face to crushing/screening plants, 
crushing/screening plants to stockpiles, and stockpiles to steel plants are listed in Table 4.43. Each 
mine supplies the uniform grade of ore, which is acceptable by each steel plant. The flows of ores 
are represented in Figure 4.2. That is, the movement of ore from one face to another face of the mine 
is not feasible. Similarly, the flows of ore from one crushing/screening plant to another crushing/
screening plant and one stock pile to another stock pile are not considered.
The cost of transportation from each face of each mine to the respective crushing/screening plant 
is US$1 per tonne per km. The cost of transportation from each face of each crushing/screening 
plant to the respective stock piles is US$0.90 per tonne per km. The cost of transportation from each 
stock pile to the steel plant is US$0.80 per tonne per km. The goal of this case study is to determine 
the optimal transportations plan for minimizing the total transportation cost.

5 Integer linear programming 
for mining systems
5.1 DEFINITION
Integer linear programming (ILP) solves linear optimization models containing variables that are 
restricted to integer values. ILP also provides a mechanism for handling nonlinearities such as fixed 
costs within an LP format. In ILP, at least one of the variables is restricted to integer values. ILP 
problems can be classified into different types, as demonstrated in Figure 5.1.
• Pure Integer Programming (PIP): In PIP, all decision variables are restricted to integer 
values.
• Mixed Integer Programming (MIP): In MIP, some but not all of the decision variables are 
restricted to integer values.
• Binary Integer Programming (BIP): In BIP, all decision variables are restricted to binary 
values, i.e., 0 or 1.
• Integer Knapsack (IK): The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization in 
which finding an optimal solution is done from a finite set of alternatives.
5.2 FORMULATION OF ILP
The linear-programming models that have been discussed in Chapter 3 are continuous in the sense 
that decision variables are allowed to be non-integer or fractions. But on many occasions, one or 
more of the decision variables are restricted to an integer value. The formulation of integer program￾ming is explained with the following example.
Example: Capital Budgeting Problem for Selecting a Mining Project
There are four possible mining projects, which each run for five years and have the following 
characteristics.

Formulate the problem as ILP to select the projects that offer a maximum total return.
An ILP can be formulated using the same approach as that used in LP. The problem has three 
components like decision variables, constraints, and objective.
Variables
The objective of the problem is to decide whether to choose a project or not. In contrast to LP, the 
formulation of ILP requires introducing variables that take the integer values of the decision vari￾able. In this case, a binary integer variable (0 or 1) is introduced to represent binary decisions like 
select a project or not selecting a project. That is,
• the positive decision (the project is selected) being represented by the value 1; and
• the negative decision (the project is not selected) being represented by the value 0.
The variables are defined as

5.3 SOLUTION ALGORITHMS OF AN ILP
Unlike LP, no unique computationally effective algorithms exist for solving IP problems. That is, IP 
is difficult to solve. The solution methods for IP can also be categorized as optimal and heuristic.
An optimal algorithm (mathematically) guarantees to find the optimal solution but is difficult to 
solve large problems. On the other hand, a heuristic algorithm offers a feasible solution close to the 
optimal solution. Therefore, a heuristic algorithm, in general, can be used to solve large problems. 
In this section, only optimal solution algorithms are discussed.
ILP is very much required when non-integer decision variables have little meaning in decision￾making problems. However, since LP solution procedures such as the simplex method treat variables 
as continuous, this method cannot be helpful for the optimization solution for ILP. Predominantly, 
two algorithms are widely used to solve an ILP: cutting plane method or Gomory’s cut method
and branch and bound (B&B) algorithm.
5.3.1  Cutting plane method or Gomory’s cut method
The cutting plane method is one of the optimization methods that iteratively adds valid inequal￾ities to the original problem to narrow down the search area enclosed by the constraints or cuts 
while retaining the feasible points. The step-wise solution algorithm of the cutting plane method is 
explained below:
Algorithm of cutting plane method
Step 1: Solve the linear programming (LP) relaxation.
Step 2: If the resulting optimal solution, X, is an integer, the optimal solution is found, and the 
algorithm stops. On the other hand, if the solution is a non-integer, go to Step 3.
Step 3: Generate a cut using the Gomory cutting plane algorithm, i.e., a constraint satisfied by all 
feasible integer solutions but not by X.
Step 4: Add this new constraint, re-solve the problem, and go back to Step 2. This terminates after 
a finite number of iterations, and the resulting X is an integer and optimal.
The detailed explanations of the solution algorithm are given while solving the following integer 
programming.

x x 1 2 + ≤ 2 6 (Constraint 2)

148
Solution
Step 1: In the first step, the problem is solved by considering only the non-negativity constraint 
of the decision variables, i.e., x x 1 2 ≥ 0, , and ignoring the integer restrictions. In that case, the 
linear programming problem can be solved using the simplex method, as the variables are con￾tinuous. However, introducing x x 1 2 , , ≥ 0 and Integer criteria in decision variables, makes the 
problem more challenging to solve. The method of ignoring the integer constraints is called 
LP relaxation.
The process of obtaining the solution to the given ILP problem by ignoring the integer constraints 
is called LP relaxation. However, the rounded solution can’t be an optimum. Thus, the reduced 
problem is represented by LP1
LP1: z Maximize = + 4 5 x x 1 2
Subject to, 3 2 12 1 2 x x + ≤
x x 1 2 + ≤ 2 6
x x 1 2 ≥ 0,
The standard form of the LP1 is
Maximize x z = + 4 5x 1 2
Subject to, 3 2 12 1 2 3 x x + + x = (5.1)
x x x 1 2 4 + + 2 6 = (5.2)
x x x x 1 2 3 4 , , , ≥ 0
In the standard form of the problem, x and x 3 4 are slack variables, which are introduced in two 
constraints to make them equality constraints. The slack variables should be non-negative. The 
reduced LP problem (LP1) is solved using the simplex method, as explained in Section 3.3.2 of 
Chapter 3. The following tables (Table 5.1, Table 5.2, and Table 5.3) show the iterative process to 
generate solutions using the simplex methods. To follow the steps of the simplex method, readers 
can consult with examples in Chapter 3.

In the second iteration, the solution reached the optimal stage as all the coefficients in the z-row 
under the basic variables are non-negatives.
Thus, the optimal solution to the problem using the simplex method is
x x 1 2 = = 3 3 , / 2
z = + 4 5 x x = + 4 3* *5 3 2 1 = 9 5 1 2 / .
The graphical representation of the solution is shown in Figure 5.2.
Step 2: The optimal solution is non-integer type as one of the decision variables is non-integer. It 
violates the constraint of integer, and thus an integer solution needs to be searched by introdu￾cing additional constraint, as explained in Step 3.
Step 3: This can be done by adding a new constraint using Gomory’s cut method in the final solu￾tion, as obtained in Step I. A Gomory’s cut is a linear constraint added to an LP problem, which 
does not exclude any feasible integer solution of the problem under consideration. It is used in 
conjunction with the simplex method to generate optimal integer solutions.
The optimal simplex table (Table 5.3) gives

The constraint equations above derive Gomory’s cut, provided its right-hand side is fractional. Out 
of three constraint equations (Eq. 5.5−5.7), the right-hand side of Eq. 5.4 is non-fractional and thus 
cannot be used for generating a Gomory’s cut. The generation of the Gomory’s cut from the other 
constraints (Eq. 5.3 and Eq. 5.5) is explained below.
Eq. (5.3) can be written as:

The above equation holds good with the justification that an integer value less than 1/2 should be 
less and equal to zero. The above constraint represents a cut, which may provide an integer solution.

In the cutting plane algorithm, the cut, which has the highest fractional value on the right-hand side, 
should be used first for obtaining the integer solution. In this case, both the cuts have the same frac￾tional value (=1/2), and thus either of the cut can be used by breaking the tie. The arbitrary selection

The revised simplex table after adding the new constraint (Cut 2) can be derived from the optimal 
simplex table (Table 5.3) by adding a new row (s1
-row). The revised table is shown in Table 5.4.
The above simplex table is optimal as all the coefficients in the z-row are non-negative but infeas￾ible as one of the elements in the RHS column is negative. Thus, a dual simplex algorithm is applied 
to obtain the solution. For a detailed explanation, readers should refer to the dual simplex algorithm 
explained in Section 3.5.2 of Chapter 3. The optimal feasible simplex table is shown in Table 5.5.

Thus, the optimal solution after introducing the new constraint (cut 2) is x1
 = 8/3, x2
 = 5/3 and 
z = 19. That is, both the decision variables are still non-integer.
The optimal solution after introducing the new constraint (cut 1) can also be derived using the 
graphical method, as there are only two decision variables. The new constraint can be represented 
in decision variables x1
 and x2
 by putting the values of x3
 and x4
 from Eq. (5.1) and Eq. (5.2), as 
represented in Figure 5.3. After adding a new constraint in the feasible region, which is shown in 
Figure 5.2, the resultant feasible region is narrowed, and a new optimal solution (D: x1
 = 8/3, x2
 =
5/3 and z = 19) was obtained. The modified feasible region is shown in Figure 5.3. The same optimal 
solution is obtained as that of the simplex method.
In the optimal simplex table (Table 5.5), the right-hand side of all the three rows (Row x1, Row x2,
and Row x3
) are fractions, and thus either of the three can be used as a source row for generating the 
cut. The fractional components of x1
-row,
 Row x2
-row,
 and x3
-row are 2/3 (= 2 + 2/3), 2/3 (1 + 2/3),

The revised simplex table after adding the new constraint [Eq. (5.12)] is derived from the optimal 
simplex table (Table 5.5) by adding a new row (s2
-row). The revised simplex table is shown in 
Table 5.6.
The simplex table is optimal as all the coefficients in the z-row are non-negative but infeasible 
as one of the elements in the RHS column is negative. Again, a dual simplex algorithm is applied to

obtain the solution. The resultant optimal simplex table after applying the dual simplex algorithm is 
shown in Table 5.7.
Thus, the optimal solution, after introducing the two cuts is x1
 = 2, x2
 = 2, is z = 18. That is, both 
the decision variables are now integers.
The optimal solution after introducing the new cut can also be derived using the graphical method. 
The new constraint [Eq. (5.12)] can be represented in terms of decision variables x1
 and x2
 by putting 
the values of s1
 from Eq. (5.1), Eq. (5.2), and Eq. (5.10), as represented in Figure 5.4. After adding a 
new constraint in the feasible region, shown in Figure 5.3, the resultant feasible region is narrowed, 
and a new optimal solution (E: x1
 = 2, x2
 = 2 and z = 18) is obtained, as shown in Figure 5.4. The 
same optimal solution is obtained as that of the simplex method.

5.3.2 Branch and bound (B&B) algorithm
Branch and bound (B&B), also called tree search, solves combinatorial optimization problems. The 
B&B method employs a diagram consisting of nodes and branches as a framework for deriving the 
solution. In this algorithm, all the solutions may need to explore to obtain an optimal solution. Land 
and Doig (1960) had first used this algorithm for discrete programming and it has become the most 
commonly used tool for solving optimization problems. In this method, the optimal integer solution 
can be identified without searching all the feasible solutions. Moreover, the method can still guar￾antee to offer the optimal integer solution. The steps involved in the B&B method for obtaining an 
optimal integer solution for a model is as follows:
Step 1: The optimal solution of the ILP problem is obtained by relaxing the integer constraint.
Step 2: The optimal solution should be assigned as the upper bound (UB), and the rounded-down 
integer solution should be assigned as the lower bound (LB).
Step 3: The decision variable that has the highest fractional value should be selected for 
branching. Two new constraints are derived by selecting the nearby integers with ≤ and ≥ sign, 
respectively.
Step 4: Two new relaxed LPP are formed by adding two constraints.
Step 5: Determine the optimal solutions of the relaxed LPPs.
Step 6: The optimal solution at each node represents the UB, and the existing maximum integer 
solution (at any node) represents the LB.
Step 7: If the branching produces a feasible integer solution with the highest UB value of any 
ending node, the optimal integer solution has been reached, and further branching is stopped. If 
a feasible integer solution does not found, branch from the node with the greatest UB.
Step 8: Go to Step 3 and repeat the process.
The B&B algorithm to solve an IP model is explained using the same example (Example 5.1).

Initially, the problem is solved by relaxing the integer constraint. That is, all the variables are 
assumed to be continuous rather than discrete. The revised problem is represented as LP1. That is, 
any LP method [Graphical method (only for two-variable problems) or simplex method (for any 
number of decision variables)] can be used to obtain the optimal solution without ensuring that the 
solution is an integer type. For a detailed explanation of the graphical method or simplex method, 
readers should refer to Section 3.2 in Chapter 3.156 Optimization techniques and their applications

LP1 : Maximize z = + 4 5 x x 1 2
Subject to, 3 2 12 1 2 x x + ≤
x x 1 2 + ≤ 2 6
x x 1 2 ≥ 0,
In this case, the LP1 has only two decision variables and thus uses a graphical method to derive 
the optimal solution, as shown in Figure 5.5. The optimal solution of LP1 is obtained at C 
(x1
 = 3, x2
 = 1.50), and the optimal value of the objective function is 19.5. Out of two decision 
variables, one decision variable (x2
) is a non-integer, and thus a non-integer solution is obtained. 
That is, the optimal solution does not satisfy the integer constraint. The integer solutions located 
in the feasible region are shown using small circles in Figure 5.5. Out of all, the optimal integer 
solution needs to be searched. The searching for an optimal integer solution is a challenging 
task, and thus the B&B algorithm can be applied. Thus, the problem represented in LP1 is fur￾ther branched into two problems (LP2 and LP3) with new constraints in the LP1 problem. As x2
(=3/2) is a non-integer in the LP1 solution, the new constraints are derived by branching x2
 to 
a nearby integer. That is, x2 ≤ 1 and x2 ≥ 2 are the two constraints, which are added in LP2 and 
LP3, respectively. If both the variables are non-integer types, either of them can be branched 
to derive the branched problems. The branched problems (LP2 and LP3) derived from LP1 by 
adding new constraints are as follows:
LP2:
Maximize z x = + 4 5x 1 2
subject to,
3 2 12 1 2 x x + ≤
x x 1 2 + ≤ 2 6
x2 ≤ 1
x x 1 2 , , ≥ 0 and Integer
LP3:

subject to,
3 2 12 1 2 x x + ≤
x x 1 2 + ≤ 2 6
x2 ≥ 2
x x 1 2 , , ≥ 0 and Integer
It can be represented using a tree search diagram, as shown in Figure 5.6.
FIGURE 5.5 Solution Space for original (LP1) with the ignorance of integer constraint.Integer linear programming for mining systems 157
157
The optimal solution points for LP2 and LP3 are C2 (x1
=10/3, x2
=1) and C3 (x1
=2, x2
=2), respect￾ively, as shown in Figure 5.7. It is observed that LP3 is pruned, and the solution can be the candidate 
for the optimal solution of the original ILP until a better solution is obtained. Therefore, no further 
branching of LP3 is required. Unlike LP3, the solutions of LP2 indicate that one decision variable is 
an integer, but the other one is still a non-integer value. Thus, the problem LP2 is further branches 
into two new problems (LP4 and LP5) by adding additional constraints. In B&B, before making a 
decision about the optimal solution of the original problem, the lower and upper bound of all the 
branched problems need to be examined.
As x1
(=10/3) is a non-integer in the LP2 solution, the new constraints are derived by branching 
x1
 to a nearby integer. That is, x1 ≤ 3 and x1 ≥ 4 are the two constraints, which are added in LP4 
and LP5, respectively. The branched problems (LP4 and LP5) derived from LP2 by adding new 
constraints are as follows:

It is observed that both the problems, LP4 and LP5, are pruned, and no further branching is 
needed as both the solutions are integer types. If LP4 or/and LP5 are offer non-integer solutions, the 
problem requires branching further by adding a new constraint. Out of all the solution points (C2, 
C3, C4, and C5), the best solution needs to be identified based on the value of the objective function 
of the original ILP.

The above results indicate that all the solutions are integer. The optimal solution is found at C3 
(2, 2), and the maximum value of the objective function is 18, as represented in Figure 5.9. LP3 
is fathomed as this cannot yield a better solution. No further branching is required for LP3. But, 
we cannot say LP3 offers the optimum solution for the original problem because LP may offer the 
better solution. Any unexamined sub-problem that cannot offer a better solution than the LB must 
FIGURE 5.8 Solution space for LP4 and LP5.Integer linear programming for mining systems 159
159
be discarded as non-promising. On the other hand, if any unexamined sub-problem produces a better 
integer solution, then the LB must be updated accordingly.
The B&B algorithm can also be used to solve the binary integer and mixed-integer problem in a 
similar approach as used in solving the pure integer problem. The application of the B&B algorithm 
in solving Binary Integer Programming is explained using the following Assignment Problem, as 
given in Example 5.2.
Example 5.2
A mine manager has to assign four types of jobs to four contract persons. Each contractor has 
the capability to complete each task but charges different costs in US$ (x106
), as shown below 
in the cost matrix table (Table 5.8). Any job can be assigned to any contractor but not more 
than one. Suggest an optimum allocation of jobs to complete at a minimum cost using a binary 
integer algorithm.
Formulation of the Problem
Let xij is the binary variable, which indicates that j
th job is assigned to i
th contractor.
The binary integer linear programming model for this problem is formulated as follows:

Constraints (1)–(4) represents only one job is assigned to one contractor, and Constraints (5)–(8) 
represent one contractor can get only one job.
There are two methods to determine the cost function:
• For each contractor, the unassigned jobs with minimum cost must be assigned.
• For each job, the unassigned contractor charges the lowest cost must be assigned.
Though for a small problem, it can be easily assigned the jobs with the lowest total minimum cost. 
But, for a larger problem, it is difficult to assign the tasks, and thus B&B algorithms can be applied 
to obtain the solution.
Before applying the B&B algorithm, the lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB) of the solution 
needs to be determined. To determine the LB, the lowest cost in each row is selected, and the sum 
of all these lowest costs represents the LB of the solution. Similarly, the sum of the highest cost in 
a row represents the UB of the solution. Since the objective function of the problem is to determine 
the minimum cost and thus the algorithm is focused on updating the LB in each level rather than 
focussing on the UB. In this problem, the lower bound of the starting solution is 72 (C1
→ J2
, C2
→ J3
, 
C3
→ J2
, C4
→ J4
), and the UB is 119 (C1
→ J1
, C2
→ J4
, C3
→ J4
, C4
→ J2
). That is, the total cost cannot 
be lower than US$ 72 million and higher than US$ 119 million. Here, the LB is updated every time 
if a change occurs. This problem is represented by LP1.
Let’s start the solution by assigning J1
 to C1
 (LP2). Once J1
 is assigned to C1
, the updated LBs are 
determined by considering the lowest cost in the rest of the rows. The lowest cost in C2
-row is 21, 
and thus J3
 is assigned to C2
. After assigning J1
 to C1
 and J3
 to C2
, the rest of the jobs are assigned to 
C3
 and C4
. In C3-row, the lowest cost excluding J1
 and J3
 columns (already assigned) is 17, which is 
corresponds to J2
 column. Therefore, job J2 is assigned to C3
. Finally, job J4
 is unassigned, and hence 
the same is assigned to C4, as shown in Figure 5.10. The total cost incurs in completing the task is 
81 (27+21+17+16). This is higher than the earlier LB, and thus the value of LB is updated. That is, 
if C1
 is assigned to J1
, the minimum cost incurs to complete all the tasks is 81 million US$. The job 
assignment made in this are represented by blue cells, as shown in Figure 5.10(a).
Similarly, if the job J1
 is assigned to C2
, C3
, and C4
, the respective allocations of the rest of the 
jobs are represented in Figure 5.10(b), Figure 5.10(c), and Figure 5.10(d). The cost incurs in three

cases (C1
→ J2
 (LP3), C1 → J3
 (LP4), C1 → J4
 (LP5)) are respectively 75 million US$, 85 million 
US$, and 80 million US$. In the next iteration, only the lowest cost node is branched to obtain the 
solution. The node that showed a higher value could not offer a better solution, and thus, branching 
is not done for those nodes. Thus, in this case, only LP2 is further branched into three constraints to 
obtain the optimal solution. That is, if C1
 is assigned by J2
, J3
, J4
, the assignments are represented by 
a blue cell in Figure 5.10(b), Figure 5.10(c), and Figure 5.10(d), respectively.
Once all the options for assigning the jobs to contractor C1
, the lowest cost option is further 
branched. This is because the options with a higher cost at the first level cannot offer a better solu￾tion. In this case, the assignment of job J2
 to C1
 offers the lowest cost (= 75 million US$). Thus, 
the node with C1
→ J2
 is further branched for examining the cost by assigning C2
→ J1
 (LP6), C2
→
J3
 (LP7), and C2
→ J4
 (LP8). Since J2
 is already assigned to C1
, it cannot be further assigned. The 
assignment with all these cases is shown in Figure 5.11(a)–(c). The costs incurred with additional 
restriction are 85 million US$, 75 million US$, and 98 million US$ respectively for LP6, LP7, 
and LP8. That is the lowest cost offers by LP7 (C1
→ J2
 and C2
→ J3
). LP7 is further branched 
with additional restrictions as C3
→ J1
 (LP9) and C3
→ J4
 (LP10). The jobs J2
 and J4
 cannot be further 
assigned. These assignments are shown in Figure 5.12(a)–(b). The cost of completion in the

two alternative assignments, shown in Figure 5.12(a) and Figure 5.12(b) are US$75 million and 
US$85 million, respectively. Finally, the low-cost alternative should be chosen. The final solution 
with all the branches is represented in Figure 5.13.
Thus, the minimum z is obtained for the following assignments:
C1

C2

C4

The value of the objective function is z = 75.
5.4 CASE STUDY OF THE APPLICATION OF MIXED INTEGER PROGRAMMING 
(MIP) IN PRODUCTION SCHEDULING OF A MINE
The present case study demonstrates the application of MIP in production scheduling for an open-pit 
iron ore mine. The iron ore mine is situated in the south-eastern part of India. This is a hilly deposit 
with a highly undulating ground level. The highest point of the deposit is 1269 m above the mean 
sea level (MSL) and the lowest point of mineralization is at 950 m above MSL. Most of the area 
of the deposit is covered by green vegetation. The geological study of the deposit revealed that this 
iron ore deposit was formed during the Precambrian age. This series of ore consists of iron ore, 
unenriched banded iron formation rocks (Banded Hematite Quartzite), shale, tuff, and quartzite. The 
FIGURE 5.13 Searching of solution subsets of the sub-problems derived using B&B algorithm.164 Optimization techniques and their applications
164
major iron ore bodies occur along the top of the range and generally at the bottom of the underlying 
shale. The deposit is situated in the southern ridge of the range. There is a number of folds, faults 
present in the mine, which indicates that the deposit is highly disturbed in nature. There were 77 
borehole data available from the mine for conducting this study. The boreholes are located in a grid 
pattern; however, the spacing of the boreholes varies from 200–250 metres. The average length of 
the boreholes is about 100 metres. Samples from the boreholes were collected in cores of less than 1-
metre. The mine has seven different lithologies, namely Steel Grey Hematite (SGH), Blue hematite 
(BH), Laminated Hematite (LH), Laterite (L), Blue Dust (BD), Shale (SHL), and Banded Hematite 
Quartzite (BHQ). The high-grade iron ore is associated with steel grey, blue and laminated hematite. 
The average depth of the mine is 160 m. The iron ore mine is equipped with a good quality control 
structure to control the quality of the ore from the extraction point to the dispatch point. The mine 
has an inbuilt crushing and screening system. There is no requirement of beneficiation because of 
high ore quality; only ore processing is required to get the product sizes. The entire ore flow diagram 
of the iron ore mine is shown in Figure 5.14.
In this case study mine, only one sample attribute (Fe) is available from borehole data. This is 
because the iron produced by this mine is of very high grade. There is very little chance that impur￾ities like silica, phosphorus, and sulfur exceed their maximum allowable limit defined by the cus￾tomer. That is the reason why the mines authority is not maintaining the data of the other attributes.
For resource modelling, the borehole information collected from the case study mine was 
composited. The compositing was done based on lithology. A total number of 1456 composited 
data was available for resource evaluation purposes. The geotechnical study of the mine shows that 
the optimum bench height for the mine is 10 m. Therefore, the resource modelling was performed 
considering a block size of 10 m along Z-direction. The 20 m × 20 m × 10 m block size was selected 
FIGURE 5.14 Ore flow-diagram of the case study mine.Integer linear programming for mining systems 165
165
for resource estimation using the block kriging algorithm. However, before resource modelling, a 
detailed statistical analysis of composited Fe samples was carried out. Table 5.9 shows the descrip￾tive statistics of the composited data. It is seen from Table 5.9 that the grade of iron is highly skewed 
towards the right side, but it has comparatively less variance. The frequency distribution of the data 
set was also prepared using the histogram plot (Figure 5.15), which clearly shows the skewness 
property of the data set. It is seen from the descriptive statistics that the average grade of Fe is 63.8 
(%), and the variance is 64.52 (%2
). The Skewness (–2.74) of the data indicates that the distribution 
is highly skewed. The K-S goodness of fit test was carried out for the normality checking of the data 
at 5% level of significance. The result of the K-S test shows that the data are not normally distributed.
This skewed distribution of the data leads to exploring the reason for the skewness of the histo￾gram. It may be due to the number of lithologies present in the study area. Therefore, statistical ana￾lysis of the lithological data was carried out to show the statistical variability within the lithology. 
The descriptive statistics of the seven lithotypes are given in Table 5.10. The results show that the 
lithology-based classification reduces the data variance. The maximum variance was found in BHQ 
lithology with 235.19, and minimum variance has found in steel grey hematite that is 1.5. But the 
distribution pattern has not been changed; all are showing the negatively skewed distribution. Box 
plot was prepared to visualize the variation lithology-wise for the Fe attribute. Figure 5.16 presents

the lithology-wise box plots of variable Fe. The box plot results revealed that the four ore-forming 
lithologies, i.e., SGS, BH, LH, and L, have less variance compare to the other three lithologies. 
This lithology-wise statistical analysis revealed the importance of lithology for grade estimation. 
Therefore, resource estimation was performed independently for each lithology after preparing 
lithology-wise solid modelling. All analysis was carried out using Surpac software (www.3ds.com/
products-services/geovia/products/surpac/).

The ordinary kriging was used for the grade estimation. The spatial correlation of the data was 
measured using the variogram analysis. Both the omnidirectional and direction variograms were 
studied for checking the anisotropy. A spherical variogram model was fitted for modelling the spatial 
continuity of all lithology. A cross-validation exercise optimally chose variogram’s parameters. After 
fitting the variograms, the search for anisotropy was carried out. The variograms were calculated at 
eight different directions with 22.50 tolerance. The directional difference was not obtained for the 
anisotropic modelling. Therefore, the isotropic model for ordinary kriging was used for modelling 
purposes. The blocks of the deposit for all seven lithologies were estimated using the ordinary kriging 
estimation technique. The ore grade map of the deposit was estimated bench-wise. A total number 
of 14 ore grade maps were generated for attribute Fe. Figure 5.17 shows the grade maps of Fe for 
the 1172 m bench. The number of blocks within the deposit that could fall within the ultimate pit of 
the deposit is 49603, and the total volume, tonnage, and average grade are 198,412,000 m3
, 567.46 
Million Tonne (MT), and 64.86%. The generated orebody model was used for production scheduling.
The open-pit production schedule assigns the extraction sequence of the blocks from the estimated 
orebody model to maximize the net present value over the mine life from the deposit. The produc￾tion schedule of open-pit mine can either be an integer programming problem or mixed-integer 
programming problem, which can be solved using the methods discussed in this chapter. However, 
due to the geometry of the deposit and the slope constraints requirement, the integer programming 
formulation may generate an infeasible solution (Chatterjee and Dimitrakopoulos, 2020). Therefore, 
mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation is used in this study. In the MIP formulation, three 
resource constraints (mining, processing, and metal) are considered; however other constraints like 
grade blending constraints can also be used. In the MIP, the resource constraints are considered soft 
constraints and can be violated using the penalty terms.
The mathematical representation of objective function for the open pit production schedule can 
be written as:

The first part of the objective function maximizes the cumulative net profit from the mine throughout 
the life of the mine. The second part of the objective function penalizes for over- and under-production 
of ore and metal quantity from target limits. The deviation of total material production (ore plus 
waste) is not allowed because the case study mine doesn’t have any option to hire extra equipment 
and labour for the over-production of mining, and they also don’t allow idle time of equipment for 
under-production at any circumstances. However, in general, any constraints other than slope and 
reserve constraints can be penalized if those constraints can be allowed to deviate from target limits.
The production schedule MIP formulation is subject to the following constraints:
Reserve constraints: A block can be mined only once during its period, which is defined as

set of overlying blocks needs to be exacted. Slope constraints are written as

Mining constraints: The amount of materials (ore plus waste) mined during each period should 
be at least equal to a minimum value to avoid an unbalanced mining flow throughout the periods. 
On the other hand, it should not exceed the mining equipment capacity available during that 
period. In this case study, the violations of these constraints are also not acceptable; therefore, 
the same mining constraints equations as the previous model are used here.

In this case study, these variables are allowed to make any real positive value up to infinity for 
which the objective function is penalized. However, one can restrict the amount of maximum devi￾ation if required. Practically, the optimizer selects positive values for these four decision variables 
during the optimization process. The optimizer selects these decision variables values as zero if 
allowing the deviation is actually reduced the objective function values.
Although the MIP formulation is easy to implement, it is the most intractable, and finding a feas￾ible solution is NP-hard (Lerchs and Grosmann, 1965). Since the production scheduling problem 
is NP-hard, we have discretized it into a set of small sub-problems, and each sub-problem was 
solved sequentially, as discussed in Chatterjee and Dimitrakopulos (2020) and Chowdhury and 
Chatterjee (2014). Finally, the results of all sub-problems were combined to get the final solution of 
the main problem. Each sub-problem was solved sequentially by branch-and-cut algorithm, which 
is a combined method of branch-and-bound and cutting plane, discussed in this Chapter. The large 
optimization problem was written using ZIMPL software (https://zimpl.zib.de/), which creates the 
lp file, which can be used in any standard optimization solver. The IBM CPLEX solver (www.ibm.
com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) is used in this case study; however, any other commercial or free 
solvers can be used for solving the problem. The list of available solvers can be found here (https://
neos-server.org/neos/solvers/). Appendix 5 shows the steps involved in solving the MIP problem 
using ZIMPL and CPLEX.
For decision-making of the blocks to be mined, an economic block model was created first from 
the resource block model. This was performed by considering the current production from mine and 
process costs and commodity price’s current economic conditions. The geotechnical and economic 170 Optimization techniques and their applications

parameters and the different constraints limits that are used in this case study are presented in 
Table 5.11.
To generate production schedule, the sequential branch-and-cut algorithm was implemented. 
Results demonstrated that a total of 1150 blocks are scheduled in period 1. The remaining blocks 
48453 (i.e., 49603–1150) were then used for the production schedule of period 2 using the same 
method. Finally, the results show that the mine can produce profitably for ten years by extracting 
a total number of 16532 blocks. The accuracy of the process is evaluated by calculating the tol￾erance gap of optimal solution and solution time. Table 5.12 shows the calculated result by the 
branch-and-cut method. Figure 5.18 presents an East-West section of the production schedule 
of the study mine. As seen from Figure 5.18, slope constraints are properly respected in this 
proposed study.
The scheduling of the case study presented here is not possible to solve optimally using any com￾mercial solver. Therefore, it is difficult to calculate the optimality gap of our proposed method for 
the real mining problem. However, in literature, it has been shown with several problems and com￾parison with the upper bound solution that the sequential branch-and-cut is very close to the upper 
bound solution (Chatterjee and Dimitrakopoulos, 2020; Lamghari and Dimitrakopoulos, 2012). 
Therefore, it can be considered that the generated production schedule for the case study mine is 
near the optimum solution. Also, the total time required for solving the 23-year production schedule

is 3139.69 seconds; thus, the branch-and-cut is computationally efficient to solve large mine sched￾uling problems.
Figure 5.19 presents material production (i.e., mining capacity) from the deposit during produc￾tion periods. The results show that the optimizer tries to maximize the production to generate more 
cashflow. The results also show that no deviation from the production target was observed.
Similar to material production, ore and metal productions were also calculated. From the ore pro￾duction data, it was observed that the ore productions are not within the ore production limits of the 
mine over the production periods. During initial periods of time, the ore production is higher than

the target bounds, and at the later periods, the ore production is lower than the target bounds. This 
is because the ore production constraint was relaxed with a penalty in the objective function, and 
therefore this constraint was not the hard constraint for production scheduling formulation. The pen￾alty of the over-production at the initial periods was compensated by producing more metals from 
FIGURE 5.18 East-West Section of the production schedule of the study mine using Model 2.

the initial period, which in turn produces more cash inflow at the initial periods. Since the penalty 
due to the underproduction cannot be compensated, the optimizer tries to delay the underproduction 
violation and underproduction violation was only observed in the last three periods of the mine life.
Similar to ore production, it was also observed that the metal productions are also not within 
the target limits in the generated schedule. As observed in ore production, during initial production 
periods, the metal production is higher than the target bounds, which generates significantly high 
cash inflow during early mine life. The optimizer pushes the under-production for the extremely later 
stage of the mine life. The goal of the production schedule is to maximize the sum of discounted 
cashflow; therefore, the optimizer tries to generate as much cashflow as possible during the first 
few years, deferring the risk of not meeting the target for the later periods. The risk profile of metal 
production also shows that the bounds of the risk is also very tight and tighter in the initial periods 
than in later periods.
After assigning blocks to different production periods, the discounted cashflow and NPV of the 
deposit were calculated. The expected NPV of the case study mine is 898 Million US dollars (M$). 
The total average amount of ore within the ultimate pit is 265 Mt, and the average amount of metal 
is 129 Mt. The total amount of materials within the ultimate pit is 568 Mt.
APPENDIX 5
This appendix shows how to use ZIMPL and CPLEX together to solve open pit production sched￾uling by MIP. The two input data that are required for solving this problem are the economic block 
value of the ore body model and the slope file. If the metal production constraints or grade blending 
constraints are considered, then a grade data file is also required. Users can create the economic 
block value data from the resource model (grade) by simple arithmetic and using the economic 
parameters. Later, in Chapter 6, a Matlab code is provided to calculate the economic block model 
from the resource model. If users need ready-to-use economic block value data and slope data, they 
can check the Minelib webpage (http://mansci-web.uai.cl/minelib/). The block economic value data, 
grade data, and slope data should be saved in text format (.txt).
The block economic value data should have two columns, where the first column represents the 
block index, and the second column represents the block economic value. The positive block eco￾nomic value represents the ore block, and the negative block economic value represents the waste 
block. The data file should not have any header row. The structure of the block economic value data 
‘cp_bev.txt’ will look like Figure 5A1. The grade data will have a similar structure as the block 
economic value date. The only difference is that the second column will have grade information in 
place of economic block value.
Like block economic value data, slope data also needs to be saved in text format (.txt). The slope 
file will also have two columns. The first column represents the index of the block under consider￾ation, and the second column represents the index of the block that needs to be mined before mining 
the index of the respective row of the first column block. These index numbers are associated with 
the block economic value data. For example, the first block in the block economic value file (first 
row in cp_bev.txt file) will have index 1, the 100th block in the block economic value file (100th row 
in cp_bev.txt file) will have index 100, etc. The structure of the file is very similar to Figure 5A2.
Once we have these two files ready, we can create the optimization formulation. The standard file 
format for CPLEX solver is .lp format. The ZIMPL open source software can be used for creating 
the .lp file. The ZIMPL executable file and installation guide can be found here (https://zimpl.zib.
de/). The users’ guide of ZIMPL software can be found here (https://zimpl.zib.de/download/zimpl.
pdf). ZIMPL can be run from command prompt by calling the executable, or double-clicking the 
executable file in the Windows operating system. Creating the .lp file in ZIMPL requires parameter 
file (.par format) and input file (.zpl format), along with the block economic value file and slope file, 
as discussed before. Both the .par and .zpl files can be created using any text editor and saved the 174 Optimization techniques and their applications

files in the respective file format. The ZPL file contains the set of equations to formulate a mixed￾integer linear programming problem. Inputs for any study are the block economic value (bev.txt) 
and slope file (slope.txt).
The parameter file (.txt file format) contains the input parameters needed for the study. It contains 
information regarding the number of years, number of blocks in the block model (number of rows in 
bev.txt file), number of slope constraints (number of rows in slope.txt file), block mass in case mass 
is constant for all blocks, mining, processing, metal production constraints, etc. Since the case study 
uses a sequential branch-and-bound approach to solve the problem, the parameter file (Ex: a_par.
txt) for the first period will look like Figure 5A3. In Figure 5A3, the parameters P, I, and S represent 
number of periods, number of blocks, and number of slope constraints, respectively. The remaining 
other values in the parameter file are obtained from Table 5.11.
Assuming all files, i.e., cp_bev.txt, cp_grd.txt (grade data file), slope.txt, and a_par.txt, and the 
ZIMPL executable file zimpl.exe are located in the same folder E:\Example; the ZPL file can be 
written as follows and be saved as ‘prod_schedule.zpl’.

To run the ZPL file in ZIMPL using the command prompt, we need to call the ZIMPL executable file 
and the ‘prod_schedule.zpl’ file, as shown in Figure 5A4. It should be noted here that there should 
be space in between ‘C:\Example\zimple.exe’ and ‘C:\Example\prod_schedule.zpl’ in the command 
prompt. It will create a ‘prod_schedule.lp’ file that can be used in CPLEX for the optimization of 
the problem.
FIGURE 5A4 Using ZIMPL to create an lp file for CPLEX optimization.178 Optimization techniques and their applications
178
To run CPLEX, we need to have CPLEX installed on the computer. The installation guide and 
user guide of CPLEX can be found here: www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer. It is noted here 
that although CPLEX is commercial software, it can be used free of cost using IBM academic ini￾tiative program (www.ibm.com/academic/home). Therefore, faculty and students can use it for free 
if they have university credentials and follow some terms and conditions mentioned in the IBM 
academic initiative program.
Once CPLEX is installed, users can call the executable file from the command prompt. By types 
‘cplex.exe’, as shown in Figure 5A5. To read the ‘prod_schedule.lp’ file from CPLEX, users need to 
write ‘READ E:\Example\prod_schedule.lp’ in the command prompt.
After CPLEX reads the problem, the command “optimize” needs to use for the optimization. 
Based on the lp formulation and decision variable types, CPLEX will automatically select the opti￾mization algorithm. By writing ‘optimize’ on the CPLEX prompt and hitting enter KEY, the user 
can run the optimization in CPLEX (Figure 5A6).
After getting the optimal solution, we can write the solution using the command “write” followed 
by the address and name where we want to save the file (Figure 5A7). The extension .sol is used to 
save the solution file. The CPLEX solution file can be open in notepad and other text editing soft￾ware. The solution file will look like Figure 5A8.

6 Dynamic programming for 
mining systems
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Dynamic programming (DP) often has been used to optimize mine systems engineering to maxi￾mize the mine operations’ economic returns. DP is a mathematical optimization method in which 
a dynamic system of equations is solved numerically. In DP, problems are divided into stages, and 
decisions on the optimal solution are taken in each stage to obtain an integrated solution.
The range of problems that can be solved is extremely wide and encompasses natural resources 
management and many other industrial applications (Kennedy, 1986). The method has also been 
applied in different types of decision-making problems of mine systems. However, decision-making 
of mine systems through the optimal solution is not a trivial process. This is because of the com￾plexity of the different operational and economic variables that need to be considered and because 
these decisions need to be made over time, i.e., considering the future, which is uncertain. The appli￾cation of dynamic programming can be used for making optimal decisions over time.
The viability of a mining project is generally evaluated through optimization techniques. 
Sometimes, the decision-making in the mines is done based on the optimal solution of a specific 
mining problem, but other times a near-optimal solution is good enough for decision making.
Richard Bellman introduced DP in the 1940s to make a stage-wise optimal decision of a problem. 
The method was refined in the year 1953 for breaking a large or complex decision-making problem 
into nested smaller decision problems (Dreyfus, 2002). In DP, the optimization problem is solved 
in recursive form. In every context, it simplifies a complicated problem by breaking it down into 
simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. If sub-problems are nested recursively inside larger 
problems, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub￾problems (Cormen et al., 2001).
Dynamic programming is adaptable to both linear and non-linear models. In addition, integer 
variables and functions cause no particular difficulties with DP. The required model structure for 
DP is challenging to describe in general terms because DP models can have a variety of mathemat￾ical forms. However, problems suitable for DP can usually be interpreted as a sequential allocation 
process.
6.2 SOLUTION ALGORITHM OF DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
The decision-making problem of mine systems can be solved by using either of forward-recursion or 
backward-recursion algorithm of DP. The key idea of DP is that the complex problem can be divided 
into multiple sub-problems, and the optimization is carried out in stages, where each sub-problem 
is one stage. In the forward-​recursion algorithm, the optimization process starts from the first stage 
and moves towards the last stage. On the other hand, in the backward-​recursion method, the solu￾tion starts from the last stage and moves toward the first stage. According to Kennedy (1986), the 
forward-recursion is more suitable for problems involving uncertain time horizons. A backward 
recursion is appropriate for solving problems that contain options with the same time horizon.
There is no generalized structure of the dynamic programming, as this can apply to both the 
linear and non-linear problems. Therefore, the algorithms are explained using case examples.184 Optimization techniques and their applications
184
Here is an overview of the method:
Step 1: The defined problem is divided into smaller sub-​problems. Each sub-​problem is defined as 
stage. A stage consists of a number of states or options, and the optimal solution of each stage 
needs to be identified.
Step 2: The solution of one sub-​problem is extended to the next stage to obtain the optimal solu‑
tion for the next stage. During computation of the current stage, the optimal decision for each 
of state does not require any additional computations of the previous stages. This is known as 
the principle of optimality for dynamic programming.
Step 3: Continue with Step 2 until the optimal solution of the original problem is obtained. The 
principle of optimality allows the solution of the problem stage by stage recursively.
The algorithm of dynamic programming is demonstrated by three examples.
6.3 EXAMPLE 1: MAXIMISING PROJECT NPV
In a large open-pit mine, the production scheduling is a challenging task as this influences the 
cost of operations. The long-term planning of open-pit mine is a dynamic process and should be 
reviewed periodically for enhancing the net present value (NPV) and life of mine. The objective 
of the optimum production scheduling is to maximize the net present value (NPV) of the mining 
project. Assuming the life of the mine of the project is four years (or the production period of the 
mine is four), as shown in Figure 6.1. The cash flow (CF) generated in a specific production period 
depends on the production schedule selected, as represented in Table 6.1. In each production period, 
only one activity can be selected to generate a valid production schedule. The number of available 
activities in each period depends on mining geotechnical constraints. The annual discounting 
factor of cash flow is 10%. Determine the optimum production schedule for maximizing NPV using 
dynamic programming.
FIGURE 6.1 Production periods in a mine.Dynamic programming for mining systems 185
185
Solution
In this case, the mine planner has multiple options for production scheduling to extract the entire 
ores in four years. This is because the production rate in each year is different and has different NPV. 
The estimated CFs for different production plan in each year are shown in Table 6.1. In addition, the 
production plan options for each year are graphically represented in Figure 6.2. Therefore, the mine 
planner needs to decide the best production schedule plan for the mine to maximize the CF.
To solve the problem using the DP technique, the problem is divided into stages. In this case, 
the production plan of four years needs to be optimized and thus divided into four stages. In 
DP, the optimization solution can be derived in two ways, viz. Backward recursion method and 
forward recursion method. In the backward recursion method, the process starts at the end of 
the life of mine (node I) and goes backward, optimizing each production period until arriving in 
the beginning node (node A). On the other hand, in the forward recursion method, the process 
starts at the first node (node A) and goes forward till it reaches to end node (node I). A detailed 
explanation of both the algorithms is given below in subsequent sub-sections.
6.3.1 Backward recursion algorithm
The problem is solved recursively by working backward in the network
Let Pij be the return in the selection of the production schedule represented by path connecting 
nodes i and j.
And, ft
(Si
) be the optimum value in stage t for ith node.
Each stage represents the CF in a specific year in different production plan.
In the backward recursion method, the computation will start from the end node (node I) and 
move towards the start node (node A) through Stage 4, Stage 3, Stage 2, and Stage 1.
Stage 4 computations
The fourth stage has only two states or two options to reach the start node from the end node of 
Stage 4. The start node of Stage 4 is the end node of Stage 3.
f S P 4 G GI ( ) = = 4
f S P 4 H HI ( ) = = 3
That is, the returns for selecting the production plan GI and HI are US$ 4 million and US$ 3 million, 
respectively.

Stage 3 computations
To move backward from the end node to the start node of Stage 3, six options (DG, EG, FG, DH, 
EH, and FH) are available (three options from each end node). The return function needs to be 
calculated for each production plan to determine the optimal value for Stage 3. The start node of 
Stage 3 can be reached from the end node of Stage 4 via node G or H.
The optimal return values to reach different nodes (D, E, and F) of Stage 3 from the end node, I, 
are as follows:

In each case, the value of ft
(Si
) should be considered the optimal value (maximum for maximiza￾tion problem and minimum for minimization problem). In this problem, f4
(SG) and f4
(SH) have only 
one value.
Stage 3 computations indicate that the maximum value to reach nodes D, E, and F from the end 
node, I, are US$ 8 million, US$7 million, and US$6 million, respectively. The maximum value can 
be achieved by selecting the production schedule paths from end node to nodes D, E, and F: DGI, 
EGI, and FGI/FHI.
Stage 2 computations
Stage 2 has two states, i.e., states B and C. To move backward from end node to start node of 
Stage 2, six options (BD, CD, BE, CE, BF, and CF) are available (two options from each end node of

Stage 2). Therefore, the return function needs to be calculated for each production plan in this stage 
to determine the optimal value for Stage 2.

Stage 2 computations indicate that the maximum value to reach nodes B and C from the end node, 
I, are US$14 million and US$13 million, respectively. The maximum value can be achieved by 
selecting the production schedule paths from end node to nodes B and C are BDGI and CDGI.
Stage 1 computations
To move backward from the end node to the start node of Stage 1, two options (AB and AC) are 
available (one option from each end node of Stage 1). The return function needs to be calculated for 
each production plan in this stage to determine the optimal value for Stage 1.
The optimal return values to reach the start node (node A) of Stage 1 from end node, I, are as

Stage 1 computations indicate that the maximum value to reach starting node, A from the end node, 
I, is US$17 million.
It is clear from the above results that the maximum value obtained in Stage 1 is US$ 
17 million, and the corresponding production schedule path is AB. The node connecting by B 
will only be considered in the next stage as this will have the maximum return value. The max￾imum return path connecting node B to the next stage is BD (=US$12 million). Thus, in the next 
stage, the paths connecting node D is the candidate for the maximum return path. The results 
show that the production schedule path DG has the maximum return value (=US$ 8 million). 
There is only one path that exist, which connects the end node I to node G. Therefore, the pro￾duction schedule path, which offers maximum returns, is I→G→D→B→A (shown with red 
arrows in Figure 6.3).

6.3.2  Forward recursion algorithm
The same problem can be solved using the forward-recursion method. In the forward-recursion 
method, the recursion moves in a forward direction from starting node, A, to end node, I, as shown 
in Figure 6.4.
Stage 1 computations
The first stage has only two states, following two paths (i.e., path AB and path AC), to reach the 
2nd stage.
f S P 1 B AB ( ) = = 3
f S P 1 C AC ( ) = = 2
That is, the returns for selecting the production plan AB and AC are US$ 3 million and US$ 2 million, 
respectively.
Stage 2 computations
To move forward from the start node to the end node of Stage 2, six options (BD, BE, BF, CD, CE, 
and CF) are available (three options from each end node). The return function needs to be calculated 
for each production plan to determine the optimal value for Stage 2. The end node of Stage 2 can be 
reached from the start node of Stage 1 via node B or C.
The optimal return values to reach different end nodes (D, E, and F) of Stage 2 from starting 
node, A, are as follows:

In each case, the value of f S t i ( ) should be considered the optimal value (maximum for maximiza￾tion problem and minimum for minimization problem). In this problem, f S 1 B ( ) and f S 1 C ( ) have 
only one value.
Stage 2 computations indicate that the maximum value to reach nodes D, E, and F from the start 
node, A, are US$ 9 million, US$ 7 million, and US$ 7 million, respectively. The maximum value 
can be achieved by selecting the production schedule paths from start node, A to nodes D, E, and F 
are ABD, ABE, and ABF.
Stage 3 computations
Stage 3 has two states, i.e., states G and H. To move forward from the start node to the end node of 
Stage 3, six options (DG, DH, EG, EH, FG, and FH) are available (two options from each end node 
of Stage 2). The return function needs to be calculated for each production plan to determine the 
optimal value for Stage 2.
The optimal return values to reach different end nodes (G and H) of Stage 3 from start node, A, 
are as follows:

Stage 3 computations indicate that the maximum value to reach nodes G and H from the start node, 
A, are US$13 million and US$10 million, respectively. The maximum value can be achieved by 
selecting the production schedule paths from the start node to nodes G and H are ABDG and ABDH.
Stage 4 computations
To move forward from the start node to the end node of Stage 4, two options (GI and HI) are avail￾able (one option from each start node of Stage 4).

Stage 4 computations indicate that the maximum value to reach end node, I from the start node, 
A, is US$ 17 million. Therefore, the production schedule path, which offers maximum returns, is 
A→B→D→G→I (shown with red arrows in Figure 6.5).
It can be observed that the optimal solution remains the same irrespective of the use of the for￾ward recursion and backward recursion method.
6.4 EXAMPLE 2: DECISION ON ULTIMATE PIT LIMIT (UPL) OF 
TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2-D) BLOCKS
A vertical section of ore/waste blocks with their economic values (Br c, ) is shown in Figure 6.6. The 
blocks can be extracted with a maximum slope of 1:1. The assigned block value is the selling price 
of the recoverable mineral contained in the block less the costs for mining, processing, transporta￾tion, and required marketing to give the saleable product per block.
The objective of this example is to determine the ultimate pit limit for maximising return using 
dynamic programming.
Solution
In the given blocks, a row of “dummy blocks” is added on the top of the section with ‘0’ economic 
block value. It is given that the block value Br c, represents the value of the selling price of 
FIGURE 6.5 Production plan showing optimal cash flow path in the forward recursion.Dynamic programming for mining systems 191
191
the mineral contained in the block less the mining cost, processing cost, transportation cost, and 
required marketing cost. All the blocks are uniquely defined with row (r) and column number (c), as 
shown in Figure 6.7. To extract a block in the level r, requires the prior mining of the blocks directly 
above this block in the same column and all the blocks within the minimum removal cone consistent 
with the slope stability requirements of the concerned block.
Now, considering any block Br c, in column c in relation to the neighboring column c-1, a max￾imum slope of 1:1 stipulates that the block Br c, can only be mined jointly with the block Br c − − 1 1 , , 
block Br c −1, , and block Br c − + 1 1 , as showed in Figure 6.8(a). Subsequently, the block Br c − − 1 1 , can only 
be mined jointly with the block Br c − − 2 2 , , block Br c − − 2 1 , , and block Br c −1, as showed in Figure 6.8(b). 
Similarly, the block Br c − + 1 1 , can only be mined jointly with the block Br c −2, , block Br c − + 2 1 , and block 
Br c − + 2 2 , ,
 as shown in Figure 6.8(c).
Therefore, to extract the block, Br c, , the overlying blocks (Br c −1, , Br c − − 1 1 , , Br c − + 1 1 , , Br c −2, , Br c − − 2 1 , , 
Br c − − 2 2 , , Br c − + 2 1 , , and Br c − + 2 2 , ) need to be extracted. Thus, the economic value of extracting any block 
is the sum of the block values that need to be extracted. The objective of extracting block Br c, is to 
FIGURE 6.6 Vertical section of ore/waste blocks with their economic values.
FIGURE 6.7 A vertical section represents the economic values (Br c, ) of individual blocks.192 Optimization techniques and their applications

maximize the sum of the block values for a pit. The optimal Pr c, value of mining the pit down to and 
including the block Br c, , can be determined as:

(6.1)
It is apparent that Eq. (6.1) is a recursion formula giving a relation applicable to any block in the 
section. There are three possible options to move from block Br,c as shown in Figure 6.8. Therefore, 
it is possible to use Eq. (6.1) to derive all the permissible pit boundaries on the section to identify the 
most optimal pit configuration. The practice is to start from one end of the cross-section (e.g., with 
the block B07) and systematically work through the block model applying Eq. (6.1) to each block 
in turn. The determination of the block pit value Pr,c for each block is performed during the forward 
pass in which the blocks are examined in the order: level-by-level within each column, followed by 
column-by-column in the sections. At the end of the forward pass, each block will be characterized 
by its pit value Pr,c, and an arrow showing its optimum neighbour.
For r = 2, and c = 4, Eq. (6.1) becomes

That is, for block B2,4, three possible movements are possible. The propagation of block extraction 
can move towards blocks B1,3, B2,3, or B3,3, depending on the pit value of the blocks.
To determine the pit value for each block, dynamic programming is used. The problem is divided 
into stages based on the number of columns of blocks. In this case, eight columns are considered, 
and thus the number of stages is also eight.

Block B4,5 is not defined, and thus no feasibility to move towards this block. The pit values (Prc) of 
blocks of Stage 7 and arrows to optimum neighbors is shown in Figure 6.15.

The pit values (Prc) of blocks of Stage 8 and arrows to optimum neighbours are shown in Figure 6.16.
Thus, the final optimum pit boundary is indicated by a blue thick line in Figure 6.17. The 
boundary offers the most economical extractions. The updated Prc value of the extreme right￾hand block of the arrow (this case block B07 in Stage 8) is 2, which is the cumulative value of the 
ultimate pit of the solution. If we superimpose the same pit in Figure 6.17 on the block model 
in Figure 6.7 and calculate the sum of the economic value within the pit from the block model, 
FIGURE 6.15 Pit values (Prc) of blocks (represented in the orange color in parenthesis) determined in Stage 7.200 Optimization techniques and their applications

we will see the cumulative value is 2, which is exactly the same as the Prc value of the block 
where the arrow ends.
6.5 EXAMPLE 3: STOPE BOUNDARY OPTIMIZATION USING DYNAMIC 
PROGRAMMING
Similar to pit limit optimization, dynamic programming can be used for underground stope boundary 
optimization. Like other optimization problems, underground stope optimization aims to maximize 
profit by increasing the revenue from recovered mineral resources and decreasing the extraction 
costs. Stope boundary optimization is significant for underground mining projects because the

FIGURE 6.17 Optimal pit limit for the maximum return based on the Prc values for each block.Dynamic programming for mining systems 201

optimal stope design ensures optimal production rates of ore with a minimum amount of waste, and 
it guides the production schedule over the life of the mine. However, developing techniques for stope 
optimization is a complex task because it requires the satisfaction of many mining constraints while 
maximizing the overall profit.
The dynamic programming provides a rigorous solution for underground stope optimization. 
The method is developed for a specific underground mining method, i.e., block caving method, 
to provide an optimum solution for a two-dimensional (2-D) slice from a three-dimensional (3-D) 
block economic value model. Riddle (1977) developed a FORTRAN code for stope optimization 
of a block caving operation using dynamic programming. The stope optimization algorithm is the 
modification of the pit optimization using dynamic programming. However, there are some basic 
differences between block cave mining and open-pit mining operations. Open-pit mining starts from 
the surface; whereas, the block caving operation can begin at any vertical elevation due to a ver￾tical boundary cut-off. The entry point of the stope can vary and can start any column horizontally, 
not required to start at the first draw point. Figure 6.18 shows an example of block economic value 
and draw point locations in a block cave mining operation. Another major difference between open 
pit and block cave mining is that the vertical range of extraction in block cave mining depends on 
the mining height of the draw point under consideration, as opposed to slope constraint in open-pit 
mining. For example, in an open pit, in the 2D section of the deposit with a 45° slope angle, only 
three adjacent blocks (one above, one below, and one on the same level) are considered for cal￾culating Pij value (see Example 2 in Section 6.4). However, the number of adjacent blocks to be 
considered for Pij calculation in block caving is determined by the row index (elevation) of the block 
and the percent draw control at the mine. If i is the row index, and d is the percentage of draw con￾trol, then the total number of adjacent blocks need to be considered for Pij the calculation is (2r+1), 
where r is represented as:
r = ceil i( *d)
Where, ceil is the ceiling value of the product. To illustrate this adjacent block consideration, let us 
assume that the block is located in row 11 and draw control is 25%. Therefore, the number of adja￾cent blocks to consider is 7 [2 * ceil(11 * 0.25) + 1 = 2 * 3+1]. Figure 6.19 shows seven adjacent 
blocks that need to consider for Pij calculation for a block in row 11 with 25% draw control in block 
cave mining.
The fundamental difference in implementing the DP algorithm for block caving requires allowing 
the entry and exit points elevation variations. The Pij calculation for block caving works very simi￾larly to the open-pit mining, except it starts from the draw point levels and goes upward, as opposed 
to starts at the surface and goes downward in the open-pit mine. The limit of the exit point is 
obtained based on the maximum Pij value. If Pmn is the maximum Pij value then exit point will be 
at draw point n and vertical lift of m.
In addition, to allow the horizontal variation of the starting block for the block caving, Pij needs 
to be calculated by changing the starting block location. To handle this phenomenon of block caving 
in dynamic programming, an additional subscript s is introduced for Pij calculation. The profit 
FIGURE 6.18 Example of block caving stope with economic block value (number inside the block represents 
block economic value) and draw points.202 Optimization techniques and their applications
202
calculation for block (i, j) is Pijs for the block in row i of the column (draw point) j, and starting at 
any level of the draw point s. The algorithm can be summarized as below:
If the 2-D section of the block economic value model has I rows and J columns (4 rows and 
3 columns, for example, Figure 6.18), the dynamic programming for stope optimization has the 
following steps:
Step 1: Calculate Pij1
 for all blocks of I rows and J columns within the 2-D section, considering 
that the mine is starting at any level of draw point 1. This is very similar to the open-pit example, 
as explained before.
Step 2: Eliminate all blocks from column 1, and calculate Pij2
 for all remaining blocks assuming 
mine starts at any level of draw point 2.
Step 3: Repeat step b until s=J.
Step 4: Determine max{Pkmn } for k=1,2,…,I; m=1,2,…,J; and n=1,2,…,j.
Figure 6.20 shows the illustration of stope optimization using example data of Figure 6.18. The per￾centage of draw control is used at 25%. Therefore, with the maximum level of 4, in this example, 
the r value will be 1. Figure 6.20(a) shows the block economic values with column and row numbers 
included. It can be seen; unlike open-pit problem, the row number starts from the bottom of the 
deposit. Moreover, there are no zero rows included on the problem at hand. The reason is that in 
open-pit mining, the entry and exit point to the pit needs to be on the surface level, which is not 
FIGURE 6.19 Seven adjacent blocks (white blocks) of a block under consideration (green block) that is 
located in row 11 with a draw control of 25%.Dynamic programming for mining systems 203
203
the necessary criteria for block cave mining. Figure 6.20(b) shows the updated Pijs value of all 
the blocks considering that the mine is starting at any level of draw point 1. Here the problem has 
been solved stages, similar to open-pit mine, and solved the first draw point level before solving 
the second draw point level, and so on. It shows the maximum cumulative block economic value 
is 26 when mining starts at any level of draw point level 1. It can also be observed that there are 
two different stope contours that provide exactly the same cumulative block economic value. It 
does not matter which pit stope we will choose; we will eventually get the same economic value. 
Figure 6.20(c) shows the updated Pijs value of all the blocks considering that the mine is starting at 
any level of draw point 2. For solving this, all the block information at draw point 1 are eliminated, 
and Pijs values are calculated. It is observed that the maximum cumulative Pijs value is 21, and there 
are two stope contours that provide the same maximum cumulative values. Similar, the Pijs value of 
all the blocks was calculated considering the mine starts at any level of draw point 3 and presented 
in Figure 6.20(d). It is observed the maximum cumulative value is 15. In this example, it can be seen 
the maximum cumulative values are 26, 21, and 15, respectively, by changing the starting location 
at draw points 1, 2, and 3. Out of these three maximum cumulative values, 26 is the maximum value 
that belongs to the solution when the starting location is at draw point 1. Therefore, the solution for 
the starting mining location at draw point 1 is the optimum solution for the problem. Figure 6.20(e) 
shows the final stope contour of the problem highlighting the blocks that are within the stope. If we 
sum up the block value within the stope contour from Figure 6.20(a), we will observe that some of 
the value is also 26.

6.6 CASE STUDY OF DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPLICATIONS TO 
DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE PIT FOR A COPPER DEPOSIT
The case study was carried out to calculate the ultimate pit limit of a copper-cobalt mine using 
dynamic programming. The mine is located in Central Africa. The deposit is a stratiform copper￾cobalt deposit. Two principal stratiform mineralized horizons are responsible for creating this ore￾body. The deposit can be followed on the surface for approx. 1400 m and to a maximum vertical 
depth of 250 m. The deposit dips 30o
–45o
, but near the surface, the deposit folds on itself. The foot￾wall consists of breccia and cuts across the orebody. The main orebody consists of Oxide, Mixed, 
and Sulphide body. The primary copper mineral is chalcopyrite.
A total of 462 borehole data are available from the historical records and recent exploratory 
drillings campaigns. The geological database was created in Surpac software using the borehole 
data. The geological database was used for interpreting ore sections, ore body modelling, and 
resource estimation. The average drill hole spacing is 50 m. The assay data were composited 
using the composite length of 1m for resource estimation. Figure 6.21 shows the interpreted 
orebody model of the deposit, which was prepared by combining the 50 m spaced vertical 
section lines. The ordinary block kriging algorithm was applied for estimating copper (Cu) in 
block size 12.5 m × 12.5 m × 5 m. Figure 6.22 shows the block kriging estimate of copper for 
this deposit. Table 6.2 presents total tonnage, average copper and cobalt grade of oxide, mixed, 
and sulfide ore zones within the deposit.
FIGURE 6.21 Orebody model of the case study deposit.
FIGURE 6.22 Block kriging estimate of case study copper deposit.Dynamic programming for mining systems 205
205
The pit limit optimization of the copper deposit is performed to identify the set of blocks from 
the deposit that will be mined over the mine life. Pit limit optimization aims to maximize profit 
by making a decision about several hundreds of thousands of mining blocks, whether to mine or 
not, subject to certain sets of constraints (Chatterjee and Dimitrakopoulos, 2020). For making the 
decision of which block to mine, an economic block model was calculated from the geologic grade 
model. The economic block value (c) of the block was calculated using the following equations:
c
Net revenue MC PC Net revenue PC
MC = − − >
−
,
,

Otherwise


 (6.2)
where
Net revenue = − T G* *REC*(P S)
MC is the mining cost, PC is the processing cost, T is the tonnage, G is the grade of Cu, REC is the 
recovery of Cu, P is the selling price of Cu, and S is the selling cost of Cu. To calculate the block 
economic value, economic parameters from Table 6.3 were used.
The ultimate pit limit problem is an integer programming (IP) formulation problem (Paithankar 
et al., 2020). The formulation of the problem can be written as:

Constraints of Eq. (6.4) are slope constraints, which ensure all overlying blocks are mined before 
mining an underlying block. Constraints of Eq. (6.5) are binary constraints, which ensure that blocks 
will be extracted or remain in the block model. Since the optimization formulation has only slope 
constraints; the optimization problem can be solved efficiently using a dynamic programming algo￾rithm (Riddle, 1977). However, it is noted here that dynamic programming can provide an optimum 
solution for a 2-D problem. Therefore, the dynamic programming needs to apply in each vertical 
section of the deposit, and then finally stitch together the solutions from each section to get a 3-D 
ultimate pit. It is noteworthy to mention here that although the individual vertical solution using the 
dynamic programming is optimum, it is not necessary that 3-D solution after stitching individual 
solution from each section will be optimum. Moreover, the generated 3-D stitching solution from 
optimum 2-D solutions can violate the slope constraints for the 3-D geometry. It should also be 
noted here that for generating a 3-D optimum solution of the ultimate pit limit. However, the purpose 
of this case study is to show the application of dynamic programming for solving the real-life 
mining problem.
For calculating the ultimate pit using dynamic programming, the resource block model from 
Surpac was used. The block model was exported as a string file, which was then formatted in Excel 
software for using in dynamic programming. The block economic value calculation and dynamic 
programming implementation were performed in the Matlab software. The step-by-step process 
of the implementation was explained in Appendix 6. The ultimate pit limit of each section was 
calculated using dynamic programming, where sections are East-West direction with 50 m section 
interval. The economic block value and ultimate pit limit along section Easting 900 of the case study 
mine are presented in Figure 6.23. After combining all sections, it was observed that within the 
ultimate pit, the total amount of ore is 9.1 Mt at an average Cu grade of 2.03%. The average stripping 
ratio was calculated as 2.22 bcm: 1 tonne.
APPENDIX 6
This appendix demonstrates how to use Matlab for ultimate pit limit calculation using dynamic 
programming. The copper data that were used in the case study section of the dynamic program￾ming were used for the demonstration. The data were saved in CSV files. The exported block model 
from Surpac is saved in CSV file ‘block_cu_output0.csv’. The screenshot of the data file is shown 
in Figure A6.1. The first three columns represent X, Y, Z of the block centroid. Fourth column

represents the classification of the mineralized zone (0 represents outside the main orebody, and 1 
represents within the orebody), and the fifth column represents copper grade. Due to the confiden￾tiality and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), the name, locations, and actual data were not 
disclosed. However, anyone can prepare the data file from the resource model and saved it in the 
CSV file format.
Loading data
Please use the data set block_cu_output0.csv. Matlab has a function to read the CSV data, but it can 
only read the numeric value. If the data has a header row, it is not recommended to use the readcsv 
function; instead, we can use ‘readtable’ function.
This code will bring the CSV data to Matlab
T = readtable(‘block_cu_output0.csv’, ‘HeaderLines’,1);
Now, we can convert the table to the matrix in Matlab by using table2array function.
Cu = table2array(T);
FIGURE A6.1 A file structure for preparing block model data for dynamic programming model.208 Optimization techniques and their applications
208
Column 4 does not have useful information for optimization using dynamic programming. Therefore, 
we can delete that column.
Cu(:,4)=[];
Block economic value calculation
In this section, we will calculate the economic block value of the Copper data. For calculating the 
block economic value, we need to provide a set of inputs.
The following inputs are needed for block economic value calculation:
Specific gravity (tonne per meter cube)
Recovery (between 0 and 1)
Selling price (dollar per pound)
Selling cost (dollar per pound)
mining cost (dollar per ton)
processing cost (dollar per ton)
Block size along X-axis (in m)
Block size along Y-axis (in m)
Block size along X-axis (in m)
We can pass these information to Matlab using the following codes:
spgr=2.7; %specific gravity of rock
rec=0.98; %recovery
slprc=3.9; % selling price of ore
slcst=0.4; % selling cost of ore
prcst=11.1; %processing cost of ore
mncst=1.2; % mining cost of rock
nx=20; %size of block in x direction
ny=20; %size of block in y direction
nz=10; %size of block in z direction
Now we are ready to calculate the block economic value. The below code will calculate the eco￾nomic block value of the entire deposit.
for i=1:length(Cu(:,1))
    y(i)= (((((((nx*ny*nz*spgr)*Cu(i,4)*rec)/ 1 0 0 ) * 2 0 0 0 * 
(slprc-slcst))-(nx*ny*nz*spgr)*(prcst+mncst))));
  if y(i)<=0
     Cu(i,5)=-nx*ny*nz*spgr*mncst;
  else
      Cu(i,5)=y(i);
 end
end
Preparing data for dynamic programming
After block economic value calculations, we need to sort data so that we can generate sections along 
the Z direction. The below code will sort the data:
P=sortrows(Cu,[2 1 3],{‘ascend’ ‘ascend’ ‘descend’});Dynamic programming for mining systems 209
209
Before generating vertical sections, another piece of information we need is the number of blocks 
along X, Y, and Z directions in the block model. This information can be obtained from the block 
model summary of the original block model data in the mining software. For the copper data, we 
know that it has the following number of blocks along X, Y, and Z directions:
Along X: 46
Along Y: 16
Along Z: 29
So, we will be creating the column vector of block economic value to the 3D block model and 
then take a slice for generating 2D sections. The individual 2D section will be used for dynamic 
programming.
The following code is used for creating the 3D blocks for section generation from the column 
vector input data:
nx=46;
ny=16;
nz=29;
Mat = reshape(P(:,5),nz,nx,ny);
Running dynamic programming in 2D
Well, now our block economic value data are ready for dynamic programming. Let us visualize the 
block economic value of one section (Figure A6.2).
% We are looking at Section 5
imagesc(Mat(:,:,5))
FIGURE A6.2 Visualisation of block economic value of one section.210 Optimization techniques and their applications
210
Now let us run the dynamic programming for one section. However, before running, we need to 
make sure the block, which cannot be mined, should artificially be set to waste block. The following 
code will do that job for section 5 of the data set:
% Let’s do it for section 5
A=Mat(:,:,5);
min_val=min(A(:));
[m,n]=size(A);
ceil_val=ceil(n/2);
floor_val=floor(n/2);
for i=1:floor_val
   A(i+1:end,i)=min_val;
   A(i+1:end,n-i+1)=min_val;
end
Now the data is ready, and we can get the ultimate pit for that section. The below code will be 
solving the ultimate pit using dynamic programming and will display the pit outline.

Now, we can put all these codes together and run for all sections one after another within a single

The function needs to be saved in the working directory or within the Matlab path. Once we have the 
function saved, we can call that function and run the code.
[U_Pit]=dynamic_prog(Mat);
Generating a file for Surpac or any mine planning software
Now we have a solution from the 3D deposit using dynamic programming. We can export it to 
Surpac or other mine planning software and visualize it there. However, before doing that, we need 
to prepare the data.
Final_sol=[P(:,1:4) reshape(U_Pit,numel(U_Pit),1)];
Once the data is prepared, we can explore the data in the CSV file.
csvwrite(‘final_pit.csv’, Final_sol)
The CSV file now can easily be imported to the block model in the mining software for visualization 
and post-processing.214215

7 Network analysis for mining 
project planning
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Project management through network analysis involves sequencing tasks or activities and identi￾fying their predecessors appropriately for executing the project in the most efficient way. The net￾work analysis starts with constructing a network diagram, which represents the interdependencies 
and time requirements of the individual tasks of the project. The individual tasks have two funda￾mental properties:
• An activity only occurs if and only if all the activities leading into it are complete.
• No activity can start until its tail activity has occurred.
For example, in the network diagram (Figure 7.1), 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 represents the nodes, A, B, C, D, 
and E represents the five activities or tasks, and a, b, c, d, and e represents the time to complete the 
tasks A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. Thus, activity E cannot start until both the activities (C and D) 
leading into it are completed.
The definitions of a few related terms are given below:
• Critical path: The longest path, which takes the longest time to complete, is termed the crit￾ical path.
• Critical tasks or activities: All the tasks that reside on the critical path are critical tasks of 
the project.
• Non-critical path: All the paths that are not the critical paths are termed non-critical paths.
• Non-critical tasks or activities: All the activities that reside on the non-critical paths are 
non-critical tasks.
7.2 REPRESENTATION OF NETWORK DIAGRAM
In the project network diagram, each activity is represented by an arc connected by two nodes 
pointing in the direction of the progress of the project. The first node represents the start of the 
activity, and the subsequent node represents the end of the activity. Thus, the nodes of the network 
represent the precedence relationship among various activities.
FIGURE 7.1 Sample network diagram.216 Optimization techniques and their applications
216
Activity can be defined as any operation which utilizes resources, except dummy, to complete and 
connect two nodes, as shown in Figure 7.2. Any activity can be classified into four types as follows.
• Predecessor activity – Activities that must be completed immediately before the start of 
another activity are called predecessor activities.
• Successor activity – A successor activity is a task that occurs following a predecessor activity. 
Any successor activity cannot start until all the immediate predecessor activities are completed.
• Concurrent activity – Activities that can be accomplished parallel are known as concurrent 
activities.
• Dummy activity – Any activity which does not consume any resource but merely depicts the 
technological dependence is called a dummy activity.
Once the list of activities and predecessors are identified, the following rules should be followed to 
construct a project network:
a. The first node (Node 1) represents the start node of the project. Any arc lead from the start 
node represents activities with no predecessors.
b. The last node represents the completion of the project and should be included with unique 
value in every project network.
c. Assign the numbers to the nodes in ascending order. That is, the node representing comple￾tion of an activity always has a higher number than the node representing start of the activity.
d. An activity should not be represented by more than one arc or two nodes should not be 
connected by more than one arc.
e. Each activity must be identified by two distinct nodes.
Figure 7.3(a)–(d) shows the network construction with different predecessor and successor 
relationships. To avoid violation of rules (d)–(f), a dummy activity with zero duration (represented 
by a dotted arc in Figure 7.3(d)) may be introduced. The dummy activity can be introduced in 
different ways to represent the concurrent activities, as shown in Figure 7.3(d).
7.3 METHODS OF DETERMINING THE DURATION OF A PROJECT
7.3.1  Critical Path Method (CPM)
CPM-based project network analysis was first introduced by Du Pont (1957) to optimize the cost of 
the project and its overall completion time. The proposed method was applied first time in 1958 in 
the construction of a new chemical plant. CPM is used to assist the project manager in scheduling 
the activities involved in a typical project.
CPM-based network analysis is conducted to determine the total duration required to com￾plete a project and identification of the critical and non-critical activities involved in the project. 
In a complete network of the project, the path with the maximum elapsed time from the start to 
the end node is called the critical path, and the activities on it are called critical activities. It is 
possible to have multiple critical paths if there is more than one path with the longest duration. 
CPM is a deterministic approach, where the durations of the various activities are assumed to 
be known with certainty.
FIGURE 7.2 Activity in a network diagram.Network analysis for mining project plan 217
217
An activity is critical if there is no flexibility in estimating the start and finish time. On the other 
hand, a non-critical task always facilitates some flexibility or slack in scheduling the start and finish 
time without delaying the overall completion of the project.
The methodology of the CPM-based network analysis is explained with the following example.

predecessor of another task, (b) one task is a predecessor of two other tasks, (c) two tasks are the predecessor 
of another task, and (d) representation of two concurrent activities.218 Optimization techniques and their applications
218
The earliest and latest occurrences of task Ak
 are defined with respect to the start and completion 
time of the project. The critical path calculation involves two passes, viz. forward pass, and back￾ward pass. The earliest start times of the activities are calculated using the forward pass, whereas the 
latest start times of the activities are estimated in the backward pass.
Computation of earliest start (ES) time earliest finish (EF) time during the forward pass
Let the project start time of the starting node, N0
 (shown in Figure 7.4) is equal to zero. Then, the 
earliest start time of the first activity, θk=1
 is equal to 0.
Let r- numbers of activities are the immediate predecessor of activity Ak
 (shown in Figure 7.5),
The earliest start time of activity, Ak
, can be determined as

, respectively, and t

, 
…,t
r
 are the duration of activities A1
, A2
, …, Ar
, respectively.
The forward pass is completed when the ES time for the end node is determined.
After completion of the forward pass, computations of the latest start (LS) time and latest finish 
(LF) time of each activity are carried out through the backward pass.
Computation of LS time and LF time during backward pass
In the backward pass, the computation starts from the end node, Ne
, and finishes at the start node, 
N0
. Let the end task is An
. The backward pass start by equating the value of EF time of the end task 
with the LF time of the end task.

The backward pass is finished when the LS value for tasks start with node 0 is computed. For the 
first task, ES LS A A 0 0

Any activity, Ak
, connected by two nodes, i and j, will be treated as a critical activity if it satisfies 
the following conditions:
ES LS A A k k
=
ES ES LS LS t A A A A k k k k k
− = − = − − 1 1
The above conditions state that the earliest start and latest start times exactly differ by the duration 
of the activity. All other activities are non-critical activities.
FIGURE 7.4 Path represents the first activity by connecting start node to subsequent node.Network analysis for mining project plan 219
219
Construction of the time schedule
For an activity, Ak
, ESAk
 represents ES time and LSAk
 represents the latest completion time. This 
indicates that the interval (ES LS A A k k
, ) delineates the maximum span during which activity, Ak
 may 
be scheduled without delaying the project.
Determination of floats
Floats are slack times available within the allotted span of the non-critical activities. These are 
mainly of two types, total float (TF) and free float (FF).
The total float is the amount of time span of the earliest start of any activity, Ak
, and the latest start 
of either of the immediately following activity, Ak+1
, over the duration, t
k
. This also indicates the time 
an activity can be delayed in completion without affecting the overall completion time of the project.
Mathematically, it can be defined as:
Total Float TF LS ES t LS ES A A A k A A k k k k k ( ) = − − = − +1
 TF LS ES t LS ES A A A k A A k k k k k ( ) = − − = − +1
On the other hand, the free float is the excess of the time span defined from the earliest start of an 
activity, Ak
, and the earliest start of any of the immediate following activity, (k+1), over the duration 
t
k
. This indicates that the completion of an activity can be delayed beyond the earliest finish time 
without affecting the earliest start of subsequent activity.
Mathematically, it can be defined as:
Free Float FF ES ES t A A A k k k k ( ) = − − +1
 FF ES ES t A A A k k k k ( ) = − − +1
FIGURE 7.5 Earliest start time of activity, Ak
 in the case of multiple predecessors.
FIGURE 7.6 Latest start time of activity, Ak
 in the case of multiple successor activities.220 Optimization techniques and their applications
220
The free float of any task is always less or equal to the total float. That is, FF TF A A k k
≤
For a non-critical activity, If FF TF A A k k
= , then the activity, Ak
, can be scheduled any time in the 
span of (ES LS A A k k
, ) without any conflict in the time schedule.
Furthermore, if FF TF A A k k
< , then the start of the activity, Ak
, can be delayed by at most, FFAk
, 
relative to its earliest start time, ESAk
 without any conflict in the time schedule.
Example 7.1
A mining company, X, has just made the winning bid to start a new mine for extraction of iron 
ore deposit. The company needs the mine to go into production operation within a year. For this, 
the company assigned a project manager to complete the construction of a mine office building 
within a period of 40 weeks. The project manager needs to finish the construction work within the 
schedule time of 40 weeks. Due to some uncertainty in the availability of labour and raw materials, 
the manager planned to finish within 47 weeks to save the excessive costs required in expediting 
the project.
The project manager has to arrange different crews to perform the various activities at different 
times. The following table listed the activities involved in the construction of the mine office. The 
duration and predecessor for each activity are listed in Table 7.1. Analyse the project using CPM for 
determining the critical path, total floats, and free floats.
Determine the following:
(a) Draw the network diagram of the project to visualize the flow of the activities.
(b) Determine earliest start and earliest finish time for each activity for completion of the project 
without any delay.
(c) Determine the latest start and latest finish of each activity to meet this project comple￾tion time.
(d) Determine the project completion time without any delays.
(e) Identify the critical activities which need to be strictly finished within the scheduled time to 
avoid delaying project completion.
(f) For noncritical activities, how much delay can be allowed without delaying project 
completion?

Solution
If each activity is completed one by one, the project will be completed in 76 weeks (i.e., summation 
of each activity time). It is much higher than the deadline of the project. Fortunately, few of the 
activities can be carried out in parallel, which substantially reduces the project completion time.
(a) The network diagram of the defined project is shown in Figure 7.7. As activity, A, does 
have any predecessor, it is considered as a starting activity, which is connected by nodes 0 
and 1. Activity, A has only one successor activity, B, which is connected by nodes 1 and 2. 
Similarly, Activity, C, connected by nodes 2 and 3, has only one predecessor task, B. Task, 
C, has three successor activities (D, E, and I), as shown in Figure 7.7. Moreover, activity F 
has only one predecessor activity, E, but activity H has two predecessor tasks, E and G. Thus, 
to comply with this, a dummy activity with zero duration is assigned between nodes 5 and 
7. Activity, J has two predecessor tasks, F and I. Activity, J is followed by K, which task L 
further follows. The last activity, M, is predeceased by two activities, H and L.
(b) The ES and EF for each activity are determined through the forward pass, as follows:
Forward pass to determine the Early Start (ES) and Early Finish (EF) time of each activity 
involved in the project.

LF Min LS LS LF A B A A = ( ) = = 2; − = t − = A 2 2 0
(d) The summarized values of ES and EF, LS, LF, and slack values for each activity are shown 
in Table 7.2.
The EF time of the end task, M, is equal to the LF of the end task. Thus, the project completion 
time is 57 weeks without any delay.
(e) The critical bottleneck activities are those which exhibit a zero slack value. It can be easily 
inferred from Table 7.2 that activities A, B, C, E, F, J, K, L, and M have zero slack value.

Therefore, the delays in the completion time of all the critical activities should be avoided to prevent 
delays in project completion time.
(f) The tolerable delays for non-critical activities without delaying project completion time can 
be determined from the free float and total floats, as explained below.

The total float and free float values indicate the following:
FF TF FF TF D D G G < < ,
TF FF TF FF H H I I = = ,
That is, the total floats and free floats for the respective activities, H and I, are equal. However, for 
activities D and G, the respective free floats are less than the total floats.
The non-critical activities, H and I, can be scheduled any time in the span of 
(ES LS H H = = 28 44 weeks w , ) eeks and (ES LS I I = = 19 26 weeks w , ) eeks , respectively, without any 
conflict in the time schedule.
On the other hand, the start of the non-critical activity, G, can be delayed by at most FFD
(= 0 weeks), relative to its earliest start time, ES weeks D (= 19 ) without any conflict in the time 
schedule.
Similarly, the start of the non-critical activity, G, can be delayed by at most FFG (=16 weeks), 
relative to its earliest start time, ES weeks D (= 19 ) without any conflict in the time schedule.
The graphical representation of the start time and end time of each activity is represented in 
Figure 7.8.

7.3.2  Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
PERT was devised in 1958 by the US Navy to optimize the time schedule of a Polaris missile 
program. Additionally, the method can accommodate the uncertainty involved in the completion 
time of the activities. PERT is similarly used for project scheduling to that of CPM; however, the 
duration of the completion of activity follows a probability distribution.
In real-life projects, the duration of some of the activities are non-deterministic for a variety of 
reasons. It is, thus, necessary to use a probability distribution to represent the stochastic nature of the 
activity duration. It is assumed that this probability distribution is continuous, unimodal, with two 
non-negative abscissa intercepts. These intercepts denoted by ‘a’ and ‘b’ (a < b) are the minimum 
and maximum time necessary to perform the job. In the context of PERT calculation, ‘a’ is referred 
to as the optimistic time, and ‘b’ is known as the pessimistic time. In addition, the modal value m is 
commonly referred to as the most likely time used in PERT calculation.
The statistical distribution, which ideally suits these assumptions, is known as a β-distribution 
(shown in Figure 7.9). For an activity Ak
, the expected duration (t
ek ) and the standard deviation (σk
) 
of the duration can be approximated by
t
a b m b a
ek k = + + = 4 −
6 6 ; σ
where
a: optimistic time of completion of an activity, when all the conditions are favourable for 
early completion than expected. This is the shortest possible time in which an activity can be 
completed in ideal conditions.
b: pessimistic time of completion when all the conditions are against the normal working con￾dition. This is the maximum possible time in which everything goes wrong, and abnormal 
situations prevail.
m: most likely time of completion of an activity, when all the conditions are normal as expected.
7.3.2.1 PERT analysis algorithm
A typical network consists of multiple activities. It is possible to estimate the probability that an 
activity, Ak
, in the network will start by a pre-specified time. Since the completion time of activity, 
Ak
 is a random variable and thus the earliest start time of activity, Ak
, is also a random variable. It is

226
assumed that all the activities in the network are random variables, and thus, the mean and variance 
of the network need to be determined. If the network consists of only one longest path from the 
start node to the end node, then the path represents the critical path. The mean of the critical path is 
the sum of expected durations (t
e
) of all the activities in the path, and the variance is the sum of the 
variances of the same activities. If the network consists of more than one path, the longest path with 
a wider statistical distribution of the durations is considered the critical path. Once the mean and 
variance of the duration of the project are obtained, the probability of completion of a project for any 
random time, t, can be determined as

In the above equation, z represents a standard normal random variable with mean and standard 
deviations are 0 and 1, respectively. The reason for consideration of normal distribution is that the 
expected project completion time, t
e
, is the sum of random independent variables, following the 
central limit theorem.
Example 7.2
A mining project has five tasks (A, B, C, D, and E). The sequence and the time required to finish 
the individual tasks in days are listed in Table 7.3. Determine the expected project completion time. 
Also, determine the probability of completing the project within 35 days.
Solution
The network diagram of the defined project with their time estimates is shown in Figure 7.10. The 
starting node of the network diagram is defined as 1. Two activities (A and B) do not have any 
predecessors and thus can be started concurrently at time zero. Activity C has only one predecessor, 
A, as represented in the network diagram. Activity A is also the predecessor of activity D and is thus 
assigned via a dummy activity. Finally, activity E is predeceased by two activities, C and D.
The expected durations along with the standard deviations of each activity are summarized in 
Table 7.4.
The network showing the expected duration of each activity is shown in Figure 7.11. The com￾putation of the expected duration of completion of the project will be done using a similar approach 
as that of CPM.
The ES, EF, LS, LF, and slack values are summarized in Table 7.5.
Thus, the critical tasks involved in the project are A, D, and E, and the expected duration of the 
project is equal to the sum of the expected duration of the critical tasks. Thus, the expected duration 
of the project = (t t t eA eD eE + + ) = 29.1 days.
The critical path is A→D→E.
Therefore, the variance of the project completion time (VT ) = Sum of the variance of the critical

7.4 NETWORK CRASHING
It is often desirable to accelerate the project’s progress. Thus, to reduce the project duration, the com￾pletion time of certain activities needs to be crashed. Crashing an activity refers to reduction in the 
completion time of the activity below to normal or estimated during through additional resources. 
These resources include overtime of workers, hiring additional manpower, special materials or 
equipment, etc. The network planning mechanism can be used to identify the activities whose dur￾ation should be crashed so that the completion time of the project can be shortened in the most 
economical manner. The process is known as network crashing. The crashing of duration should 
be done along the critical path. If there is more than one critical path, the duration of the activities 
should be crashed equally in both the paths.
The aim of the time-cost trade-off in the network crashing analysis is to reduce the estimated pro￾ject duration through critical path analysis in order to meet the pre-defined deadline with the least 
cost. The reduction in the project duration often helps in the following ways:
• Major resources are released early for use in other projects.
• Working in adverse weather conditions can be avoided, which may affect the mine productivity.
• Improve project cashflow.
The network analysis of time-cost trade-off gives the solution for crash duration estimation of each 
activity for completion of the project in a pre-defined duration. The project duration can be reduced 
by adjusting overlaps between activities or by reducing activities’ duration. In general, there is an 
inverse relationship between the time and the direct cost to complete an activity. That is, the less 
is the investment on the resources (labour, equipment, and material), the larger is the duration to 
complete an activity. Therefore, the data necessary for determining how much to crash particular 
FIGURE 7.12 Distribution of expected duration of project completion.Network analysis for mining project plan 229
229
activities can be determined from the time-cost relationship. This is demonstrated by a linear rela￾tionship, as shown in Figure 7.13.
In Figure 7.13, two points are labelled as P (TN, CN) and Q (TC, CC), which represents the normal com￾pletion time of the project and crash completion time of the project, respectively. The point, P, representing 
the normal cost and time on the time-cost graph for an activity indicate the time duration and cost of the 
activity when it is performed in the normal way. On the other hand, the point, Q, representing crash time 
and cost indicate the time and cost when the activity is fully crashed, i.e., it is fully expedited with no 
cost spared to reduce its duration as much as possible. These times and costs should be reliably predicted 
without significant uncertainty. The crashing of a network involves the following steps:
Step 1: Identification of critical path: In the first step, the critical path needs to be identified for 
the identification of the critical activities. The critical path can be identified either using CPM 
or PERT, which is an input for network crashing calculation.
Step 2: Determination of cost slopes for each activity in the network.
The cost slopes of all the activities need to be determined from time-cost trade-off relationships. 
For linear relationships, the crash cost, normal cost, crash time, and normal time data for individual 
activity can be used to determine the cost slope using Eq. 7.1.
Cost slope Crash cost Normal cost
Normal time Crash time
CC = −
− = − C
T T
N
N C − (7.1)
The cost slope indicates the demand of additional cost per unit crashing of duration to expedite the 
project. For a non-linear relationship, the functional relationship between the cost and time needs 
to be estimated.
Step 3: Sort the cost slope in ascending order
All the activities resorted from lowest to highest cost slope. The critical activity having the minimum 
cost slope has to be crashed first to its minimum duration in such a way that non-critical paths should 
not become the critical path.
Step 4: Crashing the activity
Crash the critical activities as per the order of minimum cost slope to reduce the critical path dur￾ation. The critical activity having the lowest cost slope should be crashed first to the maximum 
FIGURE 7.13 Typical time-cost graph showing a linear relationship.230 Optimization techniques and their applications
230
extent possible in order to optimize the project completion cost in the desired time period. It is 
always desired to make the cost-time trade-off analysis by crashing the activities by one day to track 
the status of the non-critical paths.
Step 5: Parallel crashing of activities
In the process of crashing the activities in the critical path, other paths may become critical. In this 
case, activities from both paths should be crashed concurrently with an equal amount to reduce the 
overall completion time of the project. In the case of parallel crashing, the arithmetic sum of the cost 
slope of all the parallel activities should be considered for comparison.
Step 6: Determination of total project cost after crashing of activities
Crashing of activities as per steps 4 and 5 should be continued until either the desirable project dur￾ation is reached or the maximum possible crashing is achieved. For the different project durations, 
the total cost is determined by adding the corresponding fixed cost to the direct cost. The direct cost 
is calculated by adding the expediting crashing cost commutative to the normal cost.
Example 7.3
The activities along with the predecessors, normal and crash completion time, normal and crash 
costs for constructing canteen in the mine is given below in Table 7.6.
Draw the network diagram. Estimate the critical path and project completion time when the 
activities are carried out in the normal process. If the indirect cost is US$600/day, determine the 
time-cost trade-off for the project for reducing the project duration by 2-weeks from the expected 
completion time.
Solution
The network diagram of the project is shown in Figure 7.14.
The values of ES, EF, LS, LF and slack are summarized in Table 7.7.
Critical Path = A→B→D1

Non-critical paths are A→C→E and A→D→D2

Normal completion time of the project = 16 + 8 + 7 = 31 days
Lengths of the other two non-critical paths are 29 days and 30 days, respectively.

Similarly, the cost slopes for all other activities are determined and listed in Table 7.8.
The order of the cost slope is
B < A < D < E < C
Crashing the project by 1-day
The crashing is done on the critical activities till no other non-critical path becomes critical. If, after 
crashing, any non-critical path becomes a critical path, then a concurrent crashing should be done to 
reduce the project cost. The minimum cost slope is on, among critical activities, activity B. Thus, the 
first target for crashing is activity B. After crashing activity B by 1-day, the duration of the project 
becomes 30 days, and the revised network of the project is shown in Figure 7.15.
The crash cost of the project is
= Normal cost + Crash cost + Indirect cost
= (18000 + 4000 + 8000 + 4000 + 4000) + 1*300 + 30*600
= US$56300

The crash cost for 1-day for activity B is US$300, and the indirect cost for 1-day is US$600. 
Therefore, the indirect cost for 30 days is US$18000 (30*600).
After 1-day crashing of activity B, one non-critical path (A→D→D2
→E) becomes a critical path 
along with the existing critical path (A→B→D1
→E). Thus, the number of critical paths in the net￾work becomes two. Therefore, a parallel crashing in both the critical paths is required to reduce the 
project completion time.
Thus, to further reducing the duration of the project, activities in both the critical paths need to 
be crushed simultaneously.
Crashing the project by 1-additional day
There are three options to reduce the duration of the project by an additional 1-day. Activities A and 
E, lay in both the paths and thus crashing either activity by 1-day reduces the project duration by 
1-day. In another way, the crashing of the network can be done by crashing activities B and D by 
1-day each. To make the cost-time trade-off, the activity with the minimum crashing cost based on 
the cost slope should be chosen. The crashing costs for three options to reduce the project cost by 
an additional 1-day are as follows:
Option 1: 1-day crashing cost of A = US$500
Option 2: 1-day crashing cost of E = US$1000
Option 3: 1-day crashing cost of B + 1-day crashing cost of D = 300 + 600 = US$900
Out of three, the crash cost of Option 1 (1-day crashing of activity A) is the lowest. Therefore, activity 
A should be crashed to reduce the duration of the project by one additional day. After crashing the

activity, A by 1-day, the duration of the project becomes 29 days, and the revised network of the 
project is shown in Figure 7.16.
Crash cost of the project is
= Normal cost + Crash cost + Indirect cost
= (18000 + 4000 + 8000 + 4000 + 4000) + (1*300 + 1*500) + 29*600
= US$56200
The crash cost for 1-day for activity B is US$300, and that of 1-day for activity A is US$500. The 
indirect cost for 29 days is US$17400 (29*600).
In a similar way, the activities can be further crashed up to the maximum possible to complete 
the project in the desired period.
Example 7.4
The project details are given in Example 7.1 for the construction of a mine office; the project man￾ager gathered additional information to speed up the project. The additional information like normal 
cost, crash cost, and maximum crash time for different activities are listed in Table 7.9.
Determine the followings by using the information given in Example 7.1 along with the add￾itional information.
(a) If uncertainty exist in estimating durations of activity, determine the probability of com￾pleting the project within the deadline of 54 weeks.
(b) Determine the least expensive way of attempting to meet the target completion time within 
55 weeks.
(c) A penalty of US$300,000 if the company has not started production activities by the dead￾line of 54 weeks from now. Determine the probability that the company has to pay the pen￾alty charges.
(d) To provide additional incentive for speedy completion of the project, a bonus of US$150,000 
will be paid to the company if the project completes within 52 weeks. Analyse the justifica￾tion for completion of the project within 52 weeks by crashing the tasks.
Solution
(a) The critical activities of the project were identified in Example 7.1 as A, B, C, E, F, J, 
K, L, and M (indicated by red mark arrows in Figure 7.17). Therefore, the critical path is 
A→B→C→E→F→J→K→L→M
FIGURE 7.16 Resultant network diagram after 2-days crash.234 Optimization techniques and their applications
234
Therefore, the mean and standard deviation of the project can be determined using mean time of 
completion of each critical activity.
Thus, the mean duration of project completion (t

[Refer to the normal distribution table. The value is corresponding to .05 in column and 0.8 in 
the row]
Therefore, the probability that the project will complete within the deadline is equal to 0.20. 
There is only a 20 percent chance that the project will complete within the deadline.
(b) The mean completion time of the project is 57 weeks, and thus crashing of 2 weeks is 
required. The cost slope of each activity is determined using Eq. (7.1) and listed in Table 7.10.
The ascending order of the cost slope is
J H * * B G L A * * CEFK * * * * = ≤ = = ≤ ≤== =
Among all the critical activities, the cost slope of activity J is the lowest (=0.25). Therefore, 
crashing of activity J should be done first. Before crashing of any critical activity, the length of the 
non-critical paths should be determined.
The lengths of the non-critical paths are as follows:
Non-critical Path 1: A→B→C→D→G→H→M
Mean Length (te1) = 2 + 5 + 12 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 7 = 41 weeks
Non-critical Path 2: A→B→C→E→H→M

236
As the lengths of three non-critical paths are 41 weeks, 37 weeks, and 50 weeks, crashing of 2 weeks 
of any critical tasks will not lead to form any non-critical to be a critical path. Thus, activity J should 
be crashed by two weeks to complete the project within 55 weeks.
The cost of completion of the project before crash = arithmetic sum of normal cost of completion 
of all the activities = 4 + 8 + 12 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 8 + 3 + 6 = US$87 thousands
On the other hand, the cost of completion of the project after crash = arithmetic sum of normal 
cost of completion of all the activities + Crash cost of activity J by 2 Weeks = (4 + 8 + 12 + 6 + 6 +
8 + 8 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 8 + 3 +6) + (2*0.25) = US$87.5 thousands
That is, there is an increase in the project cost by US$0.5 thousand (=87.5-87) for reducing the 
project completion time by two weeks.
(c) The probability of completion of the project within 54 weeks is determined as
P t( ≤ 54) = 0 20.
The probability is very less, and thus there is a maximum chance that the company has to pay the 
penalty charges of US$3,00,000 with the normal work pace. It is recommended that the company 
should speed up the work by crashing the activities in an optimal way to reduce the risk of paying 
the penalty. In solution (b), it was observed that crashing of task J by 2-weeks reduces the mean 
completion time to 55 weeks with the cost increment of US$500 only.
After crashing by two weeks, the probability of completion of the project within 54 weeks is 
given by

P z( ≤ 0 285 . . ) = 0 61
Thus, the chances of completion have been improved to 61% from 20% by crashing a task by 
two weeks. Additional cost incurred in this is US$500. If we want to further improve the chances, 
additional crashing of activities is needed. It should be noted that the crashing cost should not be 
exceeded by the penalty cost.
(d) To achieve the reward, the project needs to be completed within 52 weeks. It was estimated 
that the expected normal time of completion of the project is 57 weeks and thus needs to be 
crashed by five weeks. The maximum crashing of each activity, along with the cost slope, is 
shown in Table 7.10. The network diagram (shown in Figure 7.17) indicates that four paths 
exist, including critical paths. The lengths of each path are calculated below:
Length of the Critical Path (A-B-C-E-F-J-K-L-M) = 57 weeks
Lengths of the other paths are as follows:
Non-critical Path 1: A-B-C-D-G-H-M = 41 Weeks
Non-critical Path 2: A-B-C-E-H-M = 37 Weeks
Non-critical Path 3: A-B-C-I-J-K-L-M = 50 Weeks
Table 7.10 clearly indicates that the minimum cost slope is observed for task J and the maximum 
crashing possible to task J is two weeks, as defined in the problem. After crashing by two weeks, 
Path 1 is still the critical path. The next minimum cost slopes among critical tasks are B and L. The 
maximum crashing possible for tasks B and L is two weeks and one week, respectively. Thus, activ￾ities B and L are crashed by two weeks and one week, respectively. It should be kept in mind that Network analysis for mining project plan 237
237
after crashing of the critical tasks, neither of the non-critical paths becomes a critical path. In this 
case, the length of the critical path after crashing of five weeks is 52 weeks, which is still higher than 
the length of each non-critical path.
The revised network diagram after crashing by five weeks (2 weeks for activity J, two weeks for activity 
B, and one week for activity L) is shown in Figure 7.18. The total crashing cost of the project is given by
Total crashing cost = 0.25*2 + 0.5*2 + 0.5*1 = US$2 thousand
Thus, the expected project completion time after crashing is
t
e = 52 weeks
For a normal distribution, the probability that the project will finish within the deadline of 52 weeks 
(t = 52 weeks) is given by
P t( ≤ 52) = 0 5.
That is, the chances of project completion are 50%. It is up to the project manager that he will take 
the risk of crashing to achieve the reward.

8 Reliability analysis of mining 
systems
8.1 DEFINITION
The reliability of a mining system is the probability that it will work at the specified level without 
failure for a specified time duration under a given environmental condition. In other words, it can be 
defined as the probability that a system performs adequately with a designated service level for the 
intended period under the specified operating conditions.
Mathematically, the reliability, R t( ), of a mining system working successfully for the duration, 
T, can be represented as:
R t( ) = > P t( T T ) ≥ 0 (8.1)
where, t is a random variable denoting the time-to-failure or failure time, and P t( > T) is the prob￾ability of successful operation up to time T.
On the other hand, the failure probability, F t( ), of a system measures the probability of failure 
within the time T, can be represented as
F t( ) = ≤ P t( T T ) ≥ 0 (8.2)
8.2 STATISTICAL CONCEPTS OF RELIABILITY
Let the life of a machine be denoted by the random variable t with cumulative distribution function 
F t( ) and probability density function f t( ). In the context of reliability, F t( ) and f t( ) are also 
referred to as failure distribution. The cumulative failure distribution, F t( ), is a function of time and 
can be expressed in terms of a probability density function, f t( ) as:
F t f t dt
T
( ) = ( ) ∫
0
(8.3)
The function F t( ) represents the probability that the system will fail anywhere in the time interval 
of 0 and T.
Thus, the reliability, R t( ) is given by
R t( ) = −1 F t( ) (8.4)
R t( ) indicates the probability that the system will work at least up to time, thereby adding the time 
dimension to the definition. For any given time, t, the sum of failure probability and reliability value 
will always be constant.
8.3 HAZARD FUNCTION
The hazard function, λ (t), also referred to as the conditional failure rate function, is defined as the 
probability that a system fails after it has been in use for a given time. In other words, the limit of 242 Optimization techniques and their applications
242
the failure rate tends to zero for a specified time interval. Thus, λ (t) is the instantaneous failure rate

The above derivation indicates that the hazard function, λ (t), is the ratio of failure probability 
density function to reliability function. The failure rates of all the systems are changed with 
time. In general, the rate of failure per unit time in a mining system follows a bathtub curve 
shape (Figure 8.1). It can be inferred from Figure 8.1 that the failure rate is higher at the begin￾ning, followed by a period of constant failure rate, followed by a period of increasingly high 
failure rates. These three periods are known as the burn-in period, useful life, and wear-out period, 
respectively.
8.4 CUMULATIVE HAZARD RATE
The cumulative hazard rate for a continuous hazard rate distribution function represents the area 
under the hazard rate function. The cumulative hazard rate function (Λ(t)) is useful to determine the 
average failure rates using the following equation.

8.5 RELIABILITY FUNCTIONS
The reliability function is the statistical distribution function, which is used to model the reliability 
of a mining system theoretically. Depending on the type of mining system, continuous and discrete 
statistical distributions are applied to model the reliability. The common continuous distributions 
are exponential, normal, Weibull, and discrete distributions are binomial and Poisson distribution to 
model reliability.
8.5.1  Reliability calculation with an exponential distribution function
The probability density function (pdf) for an exponential distribution with a constant failure rate, 
λ, can be represented as
f t e e t t t ( ) = = ≥ − − λ

In the above equation, λ represents the mean number of failures per unit time, and μ represents the 
mean time to failure.

The above hazard function is constant and independent of time t. Thus, it can be inferred that the 
hazard function of an exponential distribution is constant and independent of time.
The other property of an exponential distribution function is the memory-less property. This is 
proved as follows.
Assume that a mining system (e.g., mining machine) successfully runs for time, T without any 
failure. Therefore, the conditional probability that the machine will run for (T + ΔT) time after a 
successful run of T time is given by

The hazard function of a machine can be defined linearly as λ (t t ) = − 5 1* 0 6 , where t indicates the 
operating hours of the machine. For desirable reliability of 0.98, determine the life of the machine

8.5.3  Reliability calculation with a Weibull distribution probability density function
The exponential function of the probability density function has memory-less property, and thus 
the function has limitations in wide varieties of reliability analysis. A more generalized form of 
the exponential distribution can be represented by the Weibull distribution (Weibull, 1951). The 
Weibull distribution has higher flexibility and is appropriate for modelling lifetimes of systems (or 
machines) for diversified engineering applications. The Weibull three-parameter probability density 
function is given by

distribution can be converted to the exponential distribution, the Rayleigh distribution, the normal 
distribution, and so on.
For β = 1 and γ = 0, a Weibull distribution function reduces to exponential distribution function

8.5.4  Reliability calculation with a Poisson distribution probability mass function
We have discussed different continuous distribution functions to model reliability by calculating 
failure probability within a given time window. However, sometimes, we might be interested to 
know the number of failures, which is a discrete outcome, in time t. To model reliability based on 
the discrete outcome, we can use discrete probability distribution. The Poisson distribution is one of 
the commonly used probability distribution functions in reliability analysis.

represented as

8.5.5  Reliability calculation for a binomial distribution
Similar to Poisson distribution, the binomial distribution is used for reliability calculation when the 
outcomes are discrete. The binomial distribution is used in reliability analysis when there are only

quality monitoring.

8.6 MEAN TIME BETWEEN FAILURE (MTBF) AND MEAN TIME TO 
FAILURE (MTTF)
MTBF measures the predicted time that a system (or machine) runs before the next unplanned breakdown 
happens. The MTBF is generally used for a repairable system without routine scheduled maintenance 
or routine preventive sub-systems replacement. The MTBF can be determined as the ratio of up time of 
the machine to a total number of failures in the scheduled time. Mathematically, it can be represented as
MTBF system or machine up time
Number of failures = ( )
For example, the performance of the machine is monitored for time T, as shown in Figure 8.4. During 
this time, the machine failed twice, first at time t1
 and second at time t2
, where T > t
2
 > t
1
. The machine was 
down for ∆t
1 time and ∆t
2
 the time during the first and second breakdown, respectively. The mean time 
between failures (MTBF), which is the average time between successive failures, can be determined as
MTBF System up time
Number of failures = = T t − − ∆ ∆t 1 2
2
MTBF can be calculated directly from the reliability function R t( ) by calculating the arithmetic 
mean using integration operation.
MTBF m= = R t( )dt = tf (t d) t ∫ ∫

FIGURE 8.4 Break-down hours in a specified monitoring period.256 Optimization techniques and their applications
256
Putting the value of R(t), for constant failure time and exponential distribution, we have
for m te t { } < ∞ [ ] = − , λ ∞
0 0
Thus, for the exponential distribution, the reliability or the probability that the equipment run for 
time t is equal to e-​t/m
On the other hand, MTTF is a measure of reliability used for non-repairable systems. It represents 
the length of time that a system is expected to last in operation until it fails. The MTTF can be 
determined as the ratio of total operational hours to the total number of units used in the systems. 
Mathematically, it can be represented as
MTTF Operational hours
Number of units =
In the mine systems, MTTF helps in improving the maintenance and inventory management strategy.
• MTTF is used in schedule maintenance on non-repairable items to extend the life of the items. 
For example, lubricating bearings on a larger machine.
• MTTF is also used to make decisions about purchasing parts and equipment in the inventory 
system of the mines. Good quality and durable parts lead to a higher MTTF, which requires 
fewer resources for replacing old parts.
Example 8.14
The performance of a shovel is monitored for 24 hours. The down time and up time of shovel are as 
follows (Figure 8.5).
Determine the MTBF.

8.7 MAINTAINABILITY AND MEAN TIME TO REPAIR (MTTR)
The probability of restoring a failed system to a specified condition within a scheduled time by 
repairing the system per the prescribed guidelines is termed maintainability. It is the process of iso￾lating and repairing the faulty items in a system at a scheduled time. The repair time of any system 
involves two types of time intervals, viz. passive repair time and active repair time. Passive repair 
time is the time taken by a service engineers to reach the machine location and time needed to get 
the spare parts needed to repair the machine, whereas the active repair time is the actual time the 
service engineer takes to repair the faulty system. The active repair time depends on the time needed 
to know the failure occurrence in a machine, fault detection time in the machine, replace or repair 
time of the faulty components, and checking time of the repaired machine.
For example, the time to repair or the total down time is denoted by a random variable, t, which 
follows a probability density function f t( ). It is assumed that the failed system is restored in time 
T. Then the maintainability, M t( ), of the system can be determined as
M t P t T f t dt

If the repair time follows an exponential probability distribution function, this can be defined as
f t e t ( ) = − µ µ
where, μ (> 0) represents a constant repair rate.
Then the maintainability is given by

The above equation represents the exponential form of the maintainability function. In mainten￾ance studies, one important parameter often used to measure maintainability, is mean time to repair 
(MTTR) or the mean down time. It can be defined as the expected value of the down time random 
variable, t. For an exponential distribution, it can be determined as
MTTR E t tf t dt t e dt t = ( ) = ( ) = = ∫ ∫ −

The MTTR can also be determined as the ratio of down time of the machine to the total number of 
failures in the scheduled time. Mathematically, it can be represented as

MTTR measures availability, whereas the MTBF measures availability and reliability. The higher 
the value of the MTBF, the longer the system will likely run before failing.

8.8 RELIABILITY OF A SYSTEM
In general, a system consists of multiple components or subsystems configured in different types of 
networks, and thus the reliability of the entire system depends on the reliability of its components along 
with the network configuration. For example, the network configurations may be series, parallel, a com￾bination of series-parallel, bridge, and so on. To calculate the reliability of a complex system, we need 
to know each sub-systems’ reliability and how the subsystems are configured in the complex system.
8.8.1  System reliability on a series configuration
In a series configuration, the system will operate successfully if all the sub-systems (or units) in the 
system operate normally. Figure 8.6 shows a system consists of n number of components configured 
in series with individual’s reliability R R, R 1 2 … n
, respectively.
If xj
 denotes the jth component’s event in the system, then the reliability of the system (Rs ) with 
‘n’ independent components arranged in a series configuration, is given by
R P x x x s n = … ( ) 1 2
where, P is a multivariate probability distribution function with n events. Since the components are 
independents to each other, we have
R P x P x P x s n = ( ) ) ( )… ( ) 1 2
In the above equation, P(xj
) represents the probability of occurrence of a successful event xj

for j n = 1 2, , 3,..., .

reliability and MTBF of the system for a 120-hour mission. The failure rates of all the conveyor belts

8.8.2  System reliability on parallel configuration
If either of the components operates normally in a parallel configured system, the system will work. 
Suppose a system consists of n number of components configured in parallel, as depicted in the 
block diagram given in Figure 8.8. In that case, at least one of these components must operate nor￾mally for the successful operation of the system.
If x j
 denotes the event that the jth component in the above-defined system is unsuccessful, then 
the probability of failure of the system (Rf
) with ‘n’ independent components arranged in parallel 
configuration is given by

Recall Example 8.19. If it was found that at least two pumps need to be in operation for successful 
dewatering of the pit, determine the reliability and MTBF of the system for a mission of 500 hours.
Solution
There are four possibilities that the system will work. Any two pumps will work, and the third 
will not work in three ways. There is another possibility that the system will work when all three 
pumps work.
Therefore, the reliability of the system can be calculated as,

The reliabilities of the three pump for 500-hour mission was determined as

Therefore, the failure probabilities of the three pumps are

8.8.5  System reliability of bridge configuration
In a system, five independent components are configured in a bridge network, as shown in Figure 8.12. 
The reliabilities of the five components are R1
, R2
, R3
, R4
, and R5
, respectively, and the direction of 
arrows shows the flow process.
Any bridge configuration system can be converted into a logic diagram through multiple simple 
parallel paths between IN and OUT terminals. The system can successfully work, provided all the 
components in a specified path should work. In the above diagram, no specified path on R3
 is given 
and thus flow to R3 can be occurred in both ways likeR R 1 3 → andR R 2 3 → . The logical diagram of 
the bridge network (Figure 8.12) is represented in Figure 8.13.
The logic diagram is a plain series-parallel system whose reliability can be estimated by com￾bining the series-parallel model as explained before but with the consideration interdependency of 
paths. Since some subsystems exist in more than one path, it is assumed that the failure of each sub￾system is independent of the failure of the paths, if the same does not exist in the path. This can be 
implemented using the following rule:
If P x( ) = P P 1 2 * and P y( ) = P P 2 3 * , then
Px Py ( )* * ( ) = P P *P 1 2 3
That is, P P P i i * i = for any value of i.

from the face to the shaft bottom transportation point. The configuration of the conveyor belts is

8.8.6  System reliability of standby redundancy
The standby redundancy represents a situation with one unit is in operation, and n other identical 
units are in standby mode. The configuration of this is shown in Figure 8.17. In contrast to the par￾allel redundancy where all units are in operation, all the components in standby redundancy are not 
active. The reliability of the system involves (n +1) components, in which one component is oper￾ating, and the rest of the components are on standby mode till the operating component fails.

8.9 AVAILABILITY
The availability of a system (or machine) can be defined as the probability that the system is avail￾able for performing the desired job. In other words, it is the ratio of time the system available for a 
successful operation to the total scheduled time. The total schedule time includes both down time/
breakdown time and up time of the system. Availability is generally used to measure the perform￾ance of a repairable system.
Mathematically, it can be represented as:
Availability System up time
System up time System down time = +
(8.47)
For example, the up time and down time of shovel in an open-pit mine is recorded for an 8-hour 
working shift, as shown in Figure 8.18.
The down time of the shovel is from 2 to 2.5 hours and from 6 to 7 hours. Therefore, the total down 
time of the shovel is 1.5 hours (= 0.5+1) out of an 8-hour working shift. The up time hour of the shovel 
is 6.5 hours (= 8 – 1.5). Therefore, the availability of the shovel for the recorded shift is given by
Availability System up time
System up time System down time = + = 6 5.
8 = 0 8125 81 25 . . or %
Availability can also be represented as the ratio of mean time between failures (MTBF) to the sum 
of MTBF and mean time to repair (MTTR). Mathematically, it can be represented as
Availability MTBF
MTBF MTTR = +
(8.48)
FIGURE 8.18 Performance of shovel.Reliability analysis of mining systems 271
271
In the above example, the number of failures in an 8-hour shift were observed as two, and the 
total up time and down time of the shovel were recorded as 6.5 hours and 1.5 hours, respectively. 
Therefore, the MTBF and MTTR for the above example can be determined as

The aim of the reliability analysis is to reduce the MTTR for increasing the availability of the 
systems. By reducing the value of MTTR, the performance of the system can be improved for more 
economical operation. It may always happen in the mines that the faults in the system or machine are 
difficult to diagnose, and thus, it increases the down time of the system or machine.
For a non-repairable system, the availability of the system represents the reliability or life of the 
system. But, for repairable systems, availability is equal to or greater than reliability.
Example 8.26
A pumping unit is installed in an underground mine for dewatering operation has a reliability of 0.95 
for 800 hours of successful operation. The pump’s failure probability function follows an exponen￾tial distribution. The availability of the pump during the same period is 0.98. If the hazard rates of 
failure and repair are constant, determine the MTBF and MTTR.
Solution
We have,
R t e t ( ) = −λ
where λ is constant failure rate.

8.10 IMPROVEMENT OF SYSTEM RELIABILITY
The improvement of reliability of a system is always a challenging task for engineers due to the 
decision-making process of identifying the individual component(s) that helps to improve the 
overall reliability of the system.
The improvement of system reliability can be made by following two approaches:
• Fault avoidance: The fault in the system can be avoided or minimized by using highly reli￾able components.
• Fault tolerance: This approach, known as the redundancy approach, tolerates the fault with 
the use of redundant components in the system. The drawbacks of the redundancy approach 
are increased design complexity of the system along with the costs, weight, and space require￾ment. In general, the approach is relatively expensive than the fault avoidance approach.
8.10.1  Redundancy optimization
The optimization is a critical step for improving the reliability of a system using the redundancy 
approach. The optimization technique is used for designing a system to achieve the desired reli￾ability or maximize the reliability by using redundant components with optimized cost. In this opti￾mization method, similar components are added in parallel at each stage to enhance the reliability 
of the system with optimum size or units, cost, and complexity. Thus, it is required to optimize the 
cost for obtaining the desired reliability of the system using the redundancy method. The cost and 
reliability of a simple parallel configured system can be represented as
Optimum Cost c = f ( ost numbe , , r of parallel element method of redundancy)
Desired Reliability= g(reliability, , number of parallel element method of redundancy)
Thus, the aim of the redundancy approach is to achieve the maximum or desired reliability with an 
optimal number of redundant identical units (n) for a given budgetary cost or minimum cost. The 
method of redundancy approach is demonstrated with Examples 8.27 and 8.28.
Example 8.27
In a mining system, three machines must operate in series for a successful operation with a budgetary 
cost of US$700,000. The reliabilities and cost of each unit are shown in Table 8.1. Determine the 
optimum number of redundant units based on the marginal analysis. Also, compute the improved 
reliability of the system.
Solution
In marginal analysis, the optimum number of redundant units is decided by examining the additional 
benefits obtained by the addition of a unit compared to the additional costs incurred by that same 
activity. The results of the marginal analyses are summarized in Table 8.2.

Given that, three components of the machine are connected in series. The reliabilities of three 
components for a certain time are R1
 (=80%), R2
 (=90%), and R3
 (=95%), respectively. The unit cost 
of each machine are C1 (=US$200000), C2 (=US$100000), and C3 (=US$75000), respectively. The 
objective of the study is to obtain the maximum reliability of the system with a budgetary cost of 
US$700,000.
The existing reliability of the system (Type A) is given by:
R R R R S = = = 1 2 3 08 09 09 ... * * 5 0.684
The total cost of the system having a single unit of each machine is given by
Total cost C= +1 2 C C+ = 3 200000 100000 75000 375 000, + + = US$
The first component has the lowest reliability (= 0.80) in the given system but has the highest input unit 
cost. In the first step of marginal analysis, the reliability of the system is examined with the addition of 
one redundant unit in parallel to the same one by one. The reliabilities of the systems for three cases are 
demonstrated by system configuration B, C, and D, respectively. The corresponding costs of the system are 
US$575,000, US$475,000, and US$45,000, respectively. The above analyses indicate that the reliability 
of the system cannot be increased desirably without adding a redundancy unit of the first component.
Since the incurred cost is still less than the budgetary cost, two redundant units can be added with 
additional cost. The results further indicate that two redundancy units of component 1 (condition E) 
increases the reliability of the system to 0.848. But, the cost of the system exceeded the budget. It 
can also be inferred that one redundancy unit of component 1 and component 2 each (condition H) 
increases the reliability of the system to 0.903 without exceeding the budget. The reliability of the 
system can be improved to 0.948 (Condition I) with one redundancy unit of all three components, 
but the cost exceeded the budget. Thus, the optimum condition is H.
Example 8.28
A mining machine consists of three components in series has the following characteristics, as shown 
in Table 8.3. The reliability goal is 0.90 for the system. Construct the optimum redundancy network 
for achieving the desired reliability by minimizing the cost.
Solution
Given that, three components of the machine are connected in series. The reliabilities of three 
components for a certain time are R1
 (=70%), R2
 (=80%), and R3
 (=90%), respectively. Reliability 
of RG (=0.90%) is desired for the machine.
The existing reliability of the machine is given by:
R R R R S = = 1 2 3 0 504.
The existing reliability (0.504) of the machine is less than the desired reliability of 0.90%. Thus, the 
reliability of the individual component of the system needs to be enhanced to achieve the desired 
goal. The change in the reliability of the machine will be examined by increasing the reliability of 
one component at a time. Table 8.4 shows the system configuration by adding one redundancy unit 
at each stage, one at a time.
TABLE 8.3
Reliability and cost of each unit

)
1 0.70 300
2 0.80 400
3 0.90 500Reliability analysis of mining systems 275
275
The results shown in Table 8.4 indicate that the redundancy of one component cannot improve 
the reliability of the system up to the desired level. Now, we will try increasing the reliability of two 
components at a time to see whether the reliability goal can be achieved. Table 8.5 shows different 
configuration results of two components’ redundancy.
Still, the reliability of the system is far short of the desirable reliability performance. Now, we 
will try increasing the reliability of three components at a time to see whether the reliability goal can 
be achieved. The results are summarized in Table 8.6.
The redundancy of all three components cannot facilitate the desired level of reliability perform￾ance. Therefore, we will examine the system reliability with two redundant components of the first 
component and one each for the rest of the component. The results are summarized in Table 8.7.

276
In the next step, the reliabilities of two components are enhanced at a time to improve the reli￾ability of the machine. It is also suggested that increasing the reliability of two components at a 
time shall not provide the desired goal. Furthermore, the desired goal cannot be achieved with the 
redundancy of all three components. The condition, I, when there is two redundancy unit of the first 
component and single redundancy unit of each for rest of the component, reliability of the system is 
more than the desired performance with a lower cost than the conditions J and K. It can be inferred 
from the analysis that the reliability of the system should be improved by targeting the lowest reli￾ability component.
The sensitivity analysis of the change in the reliability of the machine with the changing of indi￾vidual component’s reliability is shown in Figure 8.19. The results indicate that even by enhancing 
the reliability of individual components to a hypothetical value of 1 (R=100%), the reliability of the 
machine cannot facilitate the desired goal by improving the reliability of one component at a time. 
Thus, the reliability goal can be achieved with the addition of identical redundant components in 
parallel. The sensitivity analysis of the change in the reliability of the machine with the addition of 
identical redundant components of different reliability is shown in Figure 8.20.

8.11 RELIABILITY ANALYSIS TO A MINE SYSTEM: A CASE STUDY
8.11.1  Introduction
The reliability analyses of the mine system are important tasks to prevent the unpredicted 
breakdown of the production system. In the mine, many types of HEMMs are deployed for 
operation in harsh environments. Thus, scheduled maintenance of the system is needed to 
eliminate the system’s undesirable failure. The size and complexity of the HEMMs have been 
increased in the last few decades, and hence improvement in the reliability or availability of 
mine systems is a challenging task (Aven, 2006). In the past, many studies are conducted to 
analyse the reliability of different types of machines and mine systems for the improvement 
of the performances (Barabady and Kumar, 2008; Samanta et al., 2004; Vayenas et al., 2009; 
Gustafson et al., 2013; Roy et al., 2001; Samanta et al., 2002; Hoseinie et al., 2011a; Wang 
et al., 2012; Hoseinie et al., 2011b; Al-Chalabi et al., 2014; Rahimdel et al., 2013; Allahkarami 
et al., 2016; Morad et al., 2014; Uzgören et al., 2010; Demirel et al., 2014; Gupta et al., 
2011; Gharahasanlou et al., 2014; Yunusa-Kaltungo et al., 2017). The other critical applica￾tion areas of reliability analysis in the mining industry are preventive replacement decision 
of the equipment (Demirel and Gölbaşı, 2016; Palei et al., 2020), maintainability (Barabady 
and Kumar, 2008), availability (Kajal et al., 2013), total productive maintenance (Kalra et al., 
2015), and impact of climate conditions on the failure rates (Furuly et al., 2013). Recently, 
researchers have successfully applied different forecasting algorithms to forecast failure time 
from historical mining equipment failure data (Chatterjee and Bandopadhyay, 2012; Chatterjee 
et al., 2014; Paithankar and Chatterjee, 2018).
Chatterjee and Bandopadhyay (2012) proposed a genetic algorithm (GA)-based artificial neural 
network model for the prediction of the reliability of a load haul dump (LHD) deployed in a coal 
mine. The study results indicated that the proposed model predicts the reliability of the LHD 
satisfactorily.
The case study, presented herein, analyses the reliability of a conveyor belt installed in a mine for 
coal transportation. The data for the case study mine was taken from Gorai et al. (2017).

The production of coal in the case study mine was simultaneously done in two different working 
faces and subsequently transported through series of seven conveyor belts, as shown in Figure 8.21. 
The production line is affected by the unwanted failure of the system. The present case study 
demonstrates the reliability analysis of one conveyor belt. In a similar way, the reliability of other 
belts and subsequently for the entire conveyor belt system can be analysed.
The first step of the reliability assessment is the collection of failure and repair time data of the 
defined system (in this case, conveyor belt). The failure and repair time data of the conveyor belt for six 
months (1 July 2015 to 31 December 2015), as shown in Table 8.8, was taken from Gorai et al. (2017).
8.11.3  Exploratory data analysis
Once the failure and repair data are collected for a machine/system, the next step is to determine 
the time between failures (TBF) and time to repair (TTR) from the failure and repair data. TBF 
and TTR represent the duration between two consecutive failures and the repair of a particular 
failure event. The cumulative TBF (CTBF) and cumulative TTR (CTTR) were determined from 
the TBF and TTR data. All these calculated data (TBF, TTR, CTBF, and CTTR) are represented 
in Table 8.9.Reliability analysis of mining systems 279
279
The TBF and TTR data should be independent and identical distribution (IID) for reliability 
analysis. The IID test can be done using trend and serial correlation tests (Kumar et al., 1989). The 
same can be validated using the U-statistics test (Sen 1992). In the trend test, the CTBF and CTTR 
data were plotted against the cumulative number of failures or the cumulative number of repairs, 
respectively, as shown in Figure 8.22. It is desired that the line drawn through the data points should 
follow an approximately straight line in order to ensure data are free from any trend, which implies 
that the data set is IID (Kumar et al. 1989).
In the serial correlation test, the (i-1)th TBF or TTR data are plotted against the ith TBF or TTR 
data, respectively (Figure 8.22). If the data points are randomly scattered without any clear pattern, 
it implies a data set free from serial correlation, which implies that the data are independent (Kumar 
et al. 1989).
In the existing case, the trend test and serial correlation test results clearly indicate that the TBF 
and TTR dataset for the conveyor belt are independent and identically distributed and thus can be 
used for reliability analysis.
8.11.4  Estimating the best fit probability density function (PDF) for TBF and TTR
After examining the data for IID, the best fit PDF are estimated separately for the TBF and TTR 
datasets. The best fit analyses can be conducted based on the modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
(K-S) test (Chakravarty, Laha, and Roy, 1967). The current study examined the five PDF (exponen￾tial 2-parameter, normal, lognormal 3-parameter, Weibull 3-parameter, and Weibull 2-parameter) 
for fitting the TBF and TTR datasets. The generalized form of five PDF (exponential 2-parameter, 
normal, lognormal 3-parameter, Weibull 3-parameter, and Weibull 2-parameter) are as follows:

The results of the modified K-S test for the five distributions and the estimated parameters of the 
best-fitted PDF for TBF and TTR data are listed in Table 8.10. The best fit distribution was identified 
based on the lowest value of the K-S test.
The results shown in Table 8.10 indicate that the best-fit PDF for the TBF data is the Weibull 
3-parameter distribution function. The shape parameter (α), the scale parameter (β) and the 
location parameter (γ ) of Weibull 3-parameter distribution functions are found to be 2.4619, 
88.113, and 4.4859, respectively. Thus, the estimated PDF for the TBF data can be derived from

8.11.5  Reliability analysis for estimation of maintenance schedule
The reliability of the conveyor belt was determined using an estimated reliability function for the 
different time periods. The reliability of the conveyor belt was determined from 10 hours to 145 
hours for every 5-hour interval. The results are summarized in Table 8.11. The trend of the reliability 
with time is represented in Figure 8.23. The results indicate that the reliability of the belt 
decreases with time. For low reliability, chances of failure will be high, and hence the availability 
of the belt will be less. Thus, the performance of the belt can be improved by increasing the reliability 
through scheduled maintenance. The desired reliability of the belt can be achieved through 
estimated scheduled maintenance, as shown in Table 8.12. The scheduled maintenance hour is high 
for achieving higher reliability and vice-versa. That is, the maintenance frequency is high for higher 
desirable reliability.

The availability of the belt can be determined using the following formula:
Availability MTBF
MTBF MTTR = +
where, MTBF and MTTR represent the mean time between failure and mean time to repair, 
respectively.
The MTBF of the belt can be determined by dividing the CTBF by the total number (frequency) 
of failures. Similarly, the MTTR for the system was determined by dividing the CTTR by the total 
number (frequency) of failures. The respective values of MTBF and MTTR for the belt and the 
failure frequency are summarized in Table 8.13. It is clear from the results that the conveyor belt is 
available 97% of the time.

EXERCISE 8
Q1. It is observed from a pilot test that the failure rate of the new tyre of truck in mines linearly 
increases with time (hours), as shown below
λ (t t ) = × − 0 5 10 8 .
Find the reliability of the tyre for 8000 hours of successful run.
[Ans. 0.852]
Q2. In an open-pit mine, one pump in installed for dewatering the pit. It was estimated that 
the mean time to failure of the pump is 200 hours and the failure time follows an expo￾nential distribution. For continuous dewatering without any fail, another identical capacity 
pump is installed as a standby redundancy. While inactive, the mean time to failure of the 
standby pump is 1,000 hours, and the failure time of the standby pump is also exponentially 
distributed. Determine the reliability of the system for a mission of 300 hours and calculate 
the mean time to failure of the system.
[Ans. 0.87]
Q3. In an open-pit mine, materials are loaded by shovel and transported from the working area 
to the processing area by trucks. The mine has one shovel and six trucks for mine-to-mill 
transportation. The reliability of the shovel is 0.9, and all trucks have equal reliability of 
0.8. What is the system reliability?
[Ans. 0.899]
Q4. A pumping station in a mine has four pumps, P1
, P2
, P3, and P4, which are connected function￾ally in a parallel configuration. The individual reliability of the pumps P1
, P2
, P3, and P4
 are 
0.80, 0.90, 0.85, and 0.95, respectively. For an effective dewatering operation in the mine, at 
least three pumps should be in operation. Determine the reliability of the pumping system.
[Ans. 0.9245]
Q5. The lifetime of a shovel is exponentially distributed with a mean life of ten years. If the 
shovel has worked for ten years in an opencast mine, determine the probability that it will

9 Inventory management 
in mines
9.1 INTRODUCTION 
Inventory refers to lists of materials kept in stock to prevent the delay in supplying to the customer 
or to avoid imperfections in the production process if production capacity stands idle for lack of raw 
materials. In the competitive global economy, an asset-intensive industry like mining should prop￾erly manage and optimize the inventory system for the organization’s success.
For example, one of the challenges faced by the mining industry is proper maintenance of heavy and 
expensive machinery. These machines work in harsh environments, and the only way to achieve high 
performance from these machinery are by maintaining them in proper working condition. This can be 
achieved by periodic maintenance. Therefore, the project manager of the mine may adopt the reliability￾based maintenance approach to these types of assets, which helps to ensure that critical parts of these 
machines are in running condition, especially those with long lead times or those that are scarce.
In the mining industry, inventory management solutions need both the raw materials required for min￾eral production and produced minerals. This is because the inventory in the mine is made up of commodity 
items or raw materials, and production materials run side by side. Because inventory costs have a signifi￾cant share of the total annual mining cost, the mining industry needs to maintain an optimal inventory cost.
Moreover, mining industries are asset-heavy organizations, and hence they require a proper 
inventory system of spare parts to avoid the shutdown of the production line. The ultimate goal has 
the right parts, at the right price, in the right place, at just the right time. The challenge is maximizing 
value from this large investment, as rising costs can quickly consume production margins and take a 
significant bite out of profits. However, any inventory reductions must be achieved while mitigating 
the risk of production disruption from the potential unavailability of critical parts. Savings achieved 
through reduced inventory can quickly be lost if an unexpected production outage occurs because of 
non-availability of critical parts from inventory.
There are three basic reasons for keeping an inventory:
• Time – The time lags present in the supply chain, from supplier to user at every stage, require 
maintaining certain amounts of inventory to use in this ‘lead time’.
• Uncertainty – Inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand, supply, 
and movements of goods during lead time.
• Economies of scale – It is always desirable to buy or supply materials in bulk to reduce trans￾portation, handling, and processing costs. So bulk buying or supplying, transportation, and 
handling makes the economics of scale.
Pairing inventory management with asset management automation
Despite an in-depth understanding of the inventory principles needed for identifying stock levels, 
it is always difficult for the inventory manager to maintain that due to the large volume of items. 
The inventory management in many mining organizations has often been conducted manually on an 
annual basis, which can be a manpower-intensive and prohibitively expensive proposition.
It is always desired to implement an automated replenishment of a stock item when the stock on 
hand has fallen below a designated minimum value for cost efficiency. For example, one of the lar￾gest alumina refineries, Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL), saved more than $8 million in three 290 Optimization techniques and their applications
290
years by reducing the risk of production loss due to stock-out conditions (Mincom, 2011). Available 
at: www.mining.com/optimizing-inventory-management-for-maximum-asset-performance/).
9.2 COSTS INVOLVED IN INVENTORY MODELS
The inventory system mainly consists of four types of cost, viz. purchasing cost; setup cost (or 
ordering cost); holding cost; and penalty cost (or shortage cost). Mathematically, it can be written as:
Total Cost = + purchasing cost setup cost + + holding cost shortage cost
The trends of the various cost functions with the inventory level are shown in Figure 9.1.
Purchasing cost represents the cost per unit of an item. Purchasing costs may or may not be 
constant depending on the type of item or supplier. For producing items, the purchasing cost 
represents the unit replenishment cost.
Setup cost represents the cost incurred for placing an order, including handling of materials. 
Ordering cost mainly involves preparing purchase orders, selecting suppliers, and hand￾ling costs of materials. In general, the ordering cost is fixed irrespective of the size of 
the order.
Holding cost represents the cost of maintaining inventory in stock before it is used (or sold). 
Holding cost covers the inventory financing costs, opportunity cost of the money invested 
in inventory, storage space costs, and inventory risk costs. Inventory financing costs include 
everything related to the investment made in inventory.
Shortage cost is the penalty incurred when the mines run out of stock. It involves the following:
• Production interruption: The mining industry producing minerals and sells these 
minerals to consumers. In the mines, the company has to pay for things like idle workers 
and machines and overhead, even when production is stopped due to a shortage of materials 
like explosive or spare parts of machinery.
• Timely shipments: In the mining industry, the stock-out condition leads to untimely 
shipment of materials to consumers. As a result, the mining authority may have to pay pen￾alties and lose consumers.
• Customer loyalty and reputation: These are generally invisible costs and are hard to 
quantify. But, in the long run, these are certainly affecting the company’s reputation when 
the consumers do not get desired material in time.

9.3 INVENTORY MODELS
An inventory problem exists when it is necessary to stock physical goods or commodities for the 
purpose of satisfying demand over a specified time horizon (finite or infinite). Every mining business 
must stock goods to ensure the smooth and efficient running of its operation. Decisions regarding 
how much and when to order (or to produce) are typical for inventory problems. The required 
demand may be satisfied by stocking once for the entire time horizon or by stocking separately for 
every time unit of the horizon.
On one side, an overstock requires higher invested capital per unit time, reducing the chances 
of shortage and number of orders per unit time. On the other side, an understock decreases the 
invested capital per unit time, increases the risk of running out of stock and the number of orders 
per unit time. Thus, it is always desired to optimize the inventory system. A mathematical model 
helps the mining industry in determining the optimum inventory level for uninterrupted production 
or supply, the optimum number of orders, optimum storage of raw materials required for produc￾tion, facilitates the timely supply of materials to consumers. The inventory models can be designed 
in two ways:
• Fixed Reorder Quantity System (FOQS)
• Fixed Reorder Period System (FRPS)
The parameters of a basic inventory model are represented in Figure 9.2. In the FOQS type inventory 
model, the order is placed immediately when the inventory level drops to a fixed specified quantity
to replenish the inventory to an optimum level based on the demand. The point of a fixed specified 
quantity, q, at which the order is placed, is known as Reorder Point, and the quantity of order, 
Q, is known as Reorder Level.
In the FRPS type inventory model, an order is placed after every fixed period of time to replenish 
the inventory to an optimum level based on the demand. In this inventory management process, the 
inventory level is replenished in a continuous mode at a fixed interval of time irrespective of the 
remaining items in the inventory.
In Figure 9.2, the order is placed at times T1
, T3
, T5
. Thus, in the FRPS inventory system, T1
 – 0 =
T3
 – T1
 = T5
 – T3
. The time between placing the orders and receipt of orders (T2
 – T1
 = T4
 – T3
 = 
T6
 –T5
) is called lead time, and the demand during the lead time is called lead time demand.
The selection of optimized inventory parameters can be made with the following models.
FIGURE 9.2 Parameters of a basic inventory model.292 Optimization techniques and their applications
292
9.3.1  Deterministic model
The main characteristic of the deterministic inventory model is that it does not consider any random 
input. Therefore, the economic order quantity under the deterministic model can be determined in 
various ways depending on the situation. These are explained below.
9.3.1.1 Basic economic order quantity (EOQ) model
Assumptions of the basic EOQ model:
• The demand rate is constant with time.
• The inventory level is replenished immediately to its full capacity when the inventory level 
drops to zero.
• No shortage is allowed.
The behaviour of the inventory model is represented using a diagram, as shown in Figure 9.3. It is 
considered that the system has a capacity of Q units and the consumption or withdrawn rate is d unit 
per unit time. The lead time is zero or a constant. The optimal EOQ level can be determined with the 
above assumptions. In regard to the first assumption, the consumption of the inventory is uniform 
per unit time. The second assumption indicates that the lag time (time between placing an order and 
material receipt in the inventory) is zero or constant. Zero lag time means immediate replenishment 
of the inventory items after placing the order. The third assumption indicates that there is no shortage 
of material in the inventory system. Otherwise, penalty cost needs to be considered in the model, 
which is discussed in the next model.
Let’s assume the costs involved in the inventory system are:
Setup cost per cycle – K
Purchasing cost per unit item – C
Holding cost per unit item per unit time – h
In Figure 9.3, the time between consecutive replenishments of inventory is referred to as a cycle. 
Thus, if the withdrawn rate is d units per unit time and Q is the order quantity in a batch, the cycle 
length is Q/d.
The total cost per cycle is obtained from the following components:
Ordering cost per cycle = K
Purchasing cost per cycle = CQ
FIGURE 9.3 Basic Inventory System.Inventory management in mines 293

For a uniform demand, the level of inventory follows a linear equation. Thus, the average inventory 
level can be determined as

It is interesting to note that the holding cost and the setup cost are equal at the EOQ level. It is also 
observed from the above calculations that EOQ level (Q*) and cycle time (t*) change automatically 
with the change in the values of K, h, or d.
The optimal policy of this model does not depend on the unit purchasing or product cost. The 
EOQ level increases with increasing setup cost and consumption rate and decreases with increasing 
holding cost.
Example 9.1
In an underground mine, the demand for roof bolts for roof support is 700 units per week. Roof 
bolts are fixed at a constant rate. The setup cost for placing an order to replenish the bolts in the 
inventory system is US$400. The purchasing cost is US$20 per bolt, and the storage cost in the Inventory management in mines 295
295
inventory is US$0.01 per bolt per day. Assuming no shortages of the bolts, determine the economic 
order quantity, inventory cost, and the frequency of order. If the lead time is four days, determine 
the reorder point.
Solution
Given data: Demand (d) = 700 per week = 700/7 per day = 100 per day
 Setup cost (K) = US$400 per order
 Purchasing cost of bolts (C) = US$20 per bolt
 Holding cost (h) = US$0.01 per bolt per day
 Lead time (Lt
) = 4 days
Let the inventory level is Q.
Therefore, the total inventory cost per day is

9.3.1.2 EOQ model with planned shortages
The nightmare of any mining inventory manager is the occurrence of an items shortage in the inven￾tory system. This is also referred to as a stock-out condition. In the stock-out condition, demand 
cannot be met due to the unavailability of the desired items in the inventory. The stock-out condi￾tion leads to many problems in the mining industry, like an interruption of production, dealing with 
customers whose demands are not fulfilled. In the basic EOQ model, the shortage is not allowed, 
but in reality, it is difficult to figure out the exact inventory due to fluctuation in demand rate and 
replenishment time.
However, there are situations where a planned shortage of items in the inventory is more eco￾nomical to the inventory manager. In this case, it is important to note that consumers should accept 
a reasonable delay in receiving their orders, or the mine production system should not affect the 
mineral supply.
Thus, the costs incurred due to shortages should not be significant. This type of management is 
generally suggested when the cost of holding inventory is high relative to these shortage costs.
Assumptions of the planned shortage model:
• The demand rate is constant with time.
• The inventory level is replenished immediately to its full capacity when the inventory level 
drops to zero.
• The planned shortage is allowed. For mines, the shortage of the required items does not hamper 
the supply of minerals to the consumer. Suppliers should ensure the affected consumers, due 
to shortage, that the material will become available after the wait time. The backorders are 
filled immediately when the order quantity arrives to replenish inventory.
The inventory pattern over time with the above assumptions is shown in Figure 9.5. The pattern 
is the same as that of the basic EOQ model, except the inventory levels extend down to negative 
values that reflect the number of units of the product that are back-ordered.
Let
p = shortage cost per unit item short per unit of time short,
S = inventory level just after replenishment of inventory with a batch of Q units,
Q – S = shortage in inventory just before replenishment of inventory with a batch of Q units.
FIGURE 9.5 EOQ model with planned shortage.Inventory management in mines 297
297
The total cost per cycle is obtained from the following components:
Ordering cost per cycle = K
Purchasing or production cost per cycle = CQ
Holding cost per unit item per unit time = h
It is clear from Figure 9.5 that the inventory level is positive for a time S/d during each cycle.

Example 9.2
A coal mine in India purchases diesel for their heavy earth moving machinery (HEMM) in bulk 
and stores it in the inventory system. The demand for diesel is 730,000 litres per year. Diesel is 
consumed at a constant rate. The setup cost for placing an order to replenish the diesel in the inven￾tory system is US$800. The purchasing cost is US$1.5 per litre, and the storage cost in the inventory 
is US$0.05 per litre per day. The lead time is 16 days. If shortages are allowed but cost US$0.04 per 
litre per day, determine how often to place an order and what size it should be. It is given that the 
working days in a year is 365.300 Optimization techniques and their applications

Solution
Given data: Demand (d) = 730000 litres per year = 730000/365 litres per day
 = 2000 litres per day
 Setup cost (K) = US$800 per order
 Purchasing cost of diesel (C) = US$1.5 per litre
 Holding cost (h) = US$0.05 per litre per day
 Shortage cost (p) = US$0.1 per litre per day
 Lead time (Lt

Example 9.3
In Example 9.1, if shortages are allowed, and the shortage cost is US$5 per bolt per day, recalculate 
the inventory system considering shortage.
Given data: Demand (d) = 700 per week = 700/7 per day = 100 per day
 Setup cost (K) = US$400 per order
 Purchasing cost of bolts (C) = US$20 per bolt
 Holding cost (h) = US$0.01 per bolt per day

Thus, the maximum shortage allowed is given by
Q S * * − = 2831 2825 6 − =
It is observed that the EOQ level in no shortage allowed condition was 2828 (refer to solution of 
Example 9.1). The results indicate the EOQ levels are not significantly varied with and without 
shortages. Also, the maximum shortage allowed is only six.
That is, if either p or h is significantly larger than the other, the EOQ level with and without 
shortage does not vary significantly.
On the other hand, if the shortage cost and inventory cost are close to each other, the maximum 
shortage allowed will have a significant value (see Example 9.2).
9.3.1.3 EOQ model with price discounts
In the preceding two models, the price discounts with order size in purchasing or selling the items 
are not considered. That is, in both the previous models, the price per unit item was assumed to be 
constant irrespective of the order size. But, in reality, there is a chance that bulk quantity orders 
FIGURE 9.6 Inventory parameter of the defined system.302 Optimization techniques and their applications
302
may avail discount on the price for the items. The EOQ model with price discount works with the 
following assumptions.
• The demand rate is constant with time.
• The inventory level is replenished immediately to its full capacity when the inventory level 
drops to zero.
• No shortages are allowed.
• The unit cost of an item now depends on the order size in a batch.
The total cost per cycle is obtained from the following components:
Ordering cost per cycle = K
Purchasing or production cost per cycle = Cj
Q
Holding cost per unit item per unit time = h
In this case, the total cost has three components (purchasing cost, setup cost, and holding cost). In 
contrast to the basic EOQ model, the purchasing cost in the price discount model is varying, as the 
cost per unit item is not constant.
Thus, the total cost expressed per unit time can be written as:
Total cost per cycle
= + Purchasing cost per cycle Setup cost per cycle
+ Holding cost per cycle

d j ( ) = + + 2

Therefore, the total cost per unit time is given by

Assuming there is (n–1) number of breakpoints q q q 1 2 n 1 ( ) , ,…, − for the price discount. That is, the 
price per unit item are C C C 1 2 n , ,…, . It is assumed that C C C 1 2 n > > … > , that is higher the order

The total cost function is represented graphically in Figure 9.7. Since the two functions (TC Q1 ( ) and

The determination of the optimum order quantity Q* depends on the price breakpoint q. The 
price breakpoint, q, maybe less than Q* or more than Q* or equal to Q*. In Figure 9.7, it can be 
observed that the value of total cost (TC1
) at Q* without discount is also equal to the total cost with 
discount at Q. Mathematically, this can be written as:

By solving the above quadratic equation, we can get two values of Q. The value of Q, which is less 
than Q*, should be discarded, and the other one, which is greater than Q*, should be considered 
for defining the region, as represented in Figure 9.7. The entire range of Q can be divided into three 
regions (Region 1: 0 to Q*, Region II: Q* to Q, and Region III: Q to ∞).304 Optimization techniques and their applications
304
If the price breakpoint, q, lies in Region I, the economic order quantity should be Q*.
If the price breakpoint, q, lies in Region II, the economic order quantity should be q.
If the price breakpoint, q, lies in Region III, the economic order quantity should be Q*.

Therefore, the function follows to determine the total cost in the price discount inventory model is 
represented by the red line in Figure 9.8 for different values of price breakpoint.
The determination of the optimum order quantity Q* depends on the price breakpoint q. The 
price discount breakpoints may be more than two, depending on the order size. The breakpoint of 
FIGURE 9.7 Total cost function for an inventory model with price discounts.
FIGURE 9.8 Cost function for price discounts inventory model in different conditions.Inventory management in mines 305

price discount is either less than Q* or greater than Q* or equal to Q*. If * q Q< , the cost function 
TC1
 can be eliminated, and the total inventory cost will be determined using the TC2
 cost function, 
as shown in Figure 9.8(a). Therefore, the optimal order quantity is
EOQ Q* =
On the other hand, if * q Q> , the cost function, TC1, is followed to determine the total inventory cost, 
as shown in Figure 9.8(c). Moreover, if Q* ≤ ≤ q Q, the cost function TC2
 should be followed, as 
shown in Figure 9.8(b).
The price discount inventory model can also be solved using backward calculation by deter￾mining the total cost using a different cost function. The number of breakpoints of price discount 
in an inventory model may be more than two, depending on the order size. The optimal order quan￾tity should be decided based on the minimum total inventory cost. The method is explained in 
Example 9.4.
Example 9.4
In an underground mine, the demand for roof bolts for roof support is 700 units per week. Roof 
bolts are installed at a constant rate. The setup cost for placing an order to replenish the bolts in the 
inventory system is US$400. The purchasing cost of the bolts depends on the lot size ordered. The 
cost per unit bolt is as follows:

The storage cost in the inventory is US$0.01 per bolt per day. Assuming no shortages of the bolts, 
determine the economic order size, inventory cost, and the frequency of order. If the lead time is four 
days, determine the reorder point.
Solution
Given data: Demand (d) = 700 per week = 700/7 per day = 100 per day
 Setup cost (K) = US$400 per order
 Holding cost (h) = US$0.01 per bolt per day
 Lead time (Lt
) = 4 days
The economic order quantity (EOQ) at which minimum cost is obtained is

2828 . .
The cost functions for different order sizes are shown in Figure 9.9.
Thus, the economic order quantity (EOQ) value obtained for the given condition is 2828. As 
the EOQ level is more than the quantity of the first price discount breakpoint, the purchasing price 
per unit item is US$18. That is, the cost function TC2
 can be used to determine the inventory cost. 
For the calculated EOQ, TC2
 < TC1
 and hence TC1
 can be eliminated from further consideration. 
However, TC3
 cannot be immediately discarded as this may offer lesser total inventory cost with 
further availing the discount of US$16 per unit. To avail the further discount, the minimum order 
size is 3000. Thus, the inventory cost per day with calculated EOQ level (Q* = 2828) should be 
compared with the inventory cost per day with minimum order size for availing of the further 
discount.306 Optimization techniques and their applications

The inventory cost per day for ordering 3000 units was estimated using the cost function TC3
 and 
found to be US$1629.14. On the other hand, the inventory cost per day for ordering 2828 units was 
estimated using the cost function TC2
 and found to be US$1828.28. Therefore, it is better to order 
quantities of 3000 to avail the discount, and this is the most economical.
9.3.1.4 Multi-item EOQ model with no storage limitation
In the mining industry, similar to other industries, mines store multiple items in their inven￾tory. Therefore, the single-item inventory model may not always be very useful to understand 
the cost and benefit of managing inventory. The multi-item inventory model can eliminate the 
limitation of the single-item inventory model. The multi-item element inventory model is a nat￾ural extension of the single-item inventory model. In a multi-item EOQ model with no storage 
limitation, all the conditions are the same as that of the basic EOQ model, except the number 
of items. There are n items that need to be stored in the inventory without any competition for 
area availability.
Assumptions of the model are as follows:
• The demand rate is constant with time for each item.
• The inventory level of each individual item is replenished immediately to its full capacity 
when the inventory level drops to zero.
• No shortage is allowed for any item.

Since the problem is a complex problem, it is difficult to solve manually, and thus the problem is 
solved in Excel Solver. The optimal solution is shown in Table 9.3.
Thus, the following EOQs of the items offer the minimum inventory cost of the system.

The inventory cost is US$12271.84.
9.3.2  Fixed time-period model
In fixed time-period models, orders are placed at fixed periods without reviewing the status of the 
current inventory level, unlike earlier models. An order quantity replenishes the inventory level 
after a fixed interval of time irrespective of the demand and usage patterns. As the demand pattern 
is uncertain, a safety stock (minimum stock levels maintained in the inventory system without con￾sideration of the order quantity) is usually maintained in this type of inventory system. The EOQ

is always over and above the safety stock level. The characteristics of the model are represented in 
Figure 9.10. This model assumes that demand is known with uncertainty but follows a known prob￾ability distribution function.
The optimal inventory policy is determined in terms of the probability distribution function. It 
is important to decide the type of distribution function which follows the demand (or consumption) 
rate. This section considers a normal probability distribution function (pdf) to determine the optimal 
inventory policy.
Followings are the assumptions of the model:
• The demand level during the lead time follows a probability distribution function (normal dis￾tribution function) with a known mean and variance.
• The inventory level increases by the amount of order quantity, Q with the receipt of an order 
at fixed interval of time.
• It is assumed that shortages are fulfilled from the safety stock maintained in the inventory 
system. Any consumption from safety stock is replenished in the next order. Thus, no shortage 
or stock-out situation occurs in this type of inventory system due to safety stock. The safety 
stock can be determined from the probabilities of shortages or stock-out conditions and the 
expected demand during the lead time. Thus, the demand is assumed a random variable, X, 
and follows a normal distribution. The random variable, X, has pdf, f(X).
Assuming that the demand per unit time is normal with mean µd and standard deviation σd
, the mean 
and standard deviation during the lead time, Lt
, can be computed as:
Mean demand during the lead time (µ µ ) L d t = L
The standard deviation of demand during the lead time ( ) σ σ L d t = L2
The probability of determining the safety stock to avoid the shortage or stock-out condition is 
given by
P X B L L ( ) ≥ + µ α ≤

In Eq. (9.13), Aα
 represents the area of the shaded region in Figure 9.11. For a normal distribution 
function, Aα
 value for different Kα
 can be determined from the statistical table. Few data from the 
statistical table are represented in Table 9.4 for reference.
Hence, the safety stock must be determined by multiplying the standard deviation of the lead 
time demand (σL ) and probability of stock-out condition during the lead time at a certain confidence 
level (Kα). The mathematical form to derive the safety stock from avoiding the shortage or stock-out 
condition is shown in Eq.(9.14)
Safety stock B KL ( ) ≥ σ α (9.14)
The value of service factors for a different level of service are summarized in Table 9.4.
Example 9.7
To deal with the inventory policy of roof bolt in a mine, EOQ = 1000 units. If the daily demand 
follows a normal distribution with mean μd
 = 100 units and standard deviation, σd
 =10 units, then 
determine the safety stock so that the probability of running out of stock is below 0.05. It is given 
that the effective lead time is two days.
FIGURE 9.11 Probability of stock-out condition.314 Optimization techniques and their applications
314
Solution
Given data:
Daily mean demand µd ( ) = 100 units
Standard deviation (σd ) =10 units
Lead time (Lt
) = 2 days
Desired confidence level (Kα) = 0.05
Therefore,
µ µ L d = = Lt 100 2 200 * = units
Standard deviation during the lead time is given by
σ σ L d t = = L = 2 2 10 * 2 14 4. 1
From Table 9.4, we have
K0.05 = 1.645
Thus, the safety stock can be computed as
B KL ≥ σ α
B ≥ 14 41*1 6. 4.
B ≥ ≈ 23 70 24.
Therefore, the optimal inventory policy with safety stock, 24 units, should be maintained in the 
inventory system to avoid the stock-out condition with a 95% probability. The maximum inventory 
level in the system is equal to B + EOQ (= 24 + 1000 = 1024).,
9.3.3  Probabilistic EOQ model
The probabilistic EOQ model considers probabilistic demand to determine the EOQ level. In the 
probabilistic inventory model, the demand is considered to be probabilistic in nature in contrast to

the deterministic model, where the demand is assumed to be constant. Following are the assumptions 
of the model:
• Unfilled demand during lead time is backlogged
• Maximum one outstanding order is allowed
• The distribution of the demand during lead time remains stationary with time
The model allows shortage of demand. The order of Q is placed whenever the inventory level drops 
to reorder level, q. In the deterministic inventory models, the reorder point, q, is the lead time 
demand, which is constant, but in the probabilistic inventory model, the lead time demand is vari￾able, as the demand is not known with certainty. The objective is to determine the Q and q for which 
the total expected cost is the lowest. The nature of a typical probabilistic EOQ model is shown in 
Figure 9.12.
The total cost per cycle is obtained from the following components:
Ordering cost per cycle = K
Purchasing or production cost per unit = C
Holding cost per unit item per unit time = h
Shortage cost per inventory unit per unit time = p
Let pdf of demand, X during lead time L is f(X)
Expected demand per unit time is d
Let the expected shortage level in a cycle is S. Therefore, the inventory level is positive for a time 
S/d during each cycle.

Example 9.8
In an underground mine, production is done using drilling and blasting. The demand for explosives 
in the mine is 3000 kg per month. It costs US$400 to place an order for a new batch. The holding 
cost of the explosive in the magazine room is US$0.1 per kg per day, and the shortage cost is US$4 
per kg. According to past statistics, consumption of the explosives during lead time is uniform over 318 Optimization techniques and their applications

the range of 0 to 200 kg. Determine the optimum ordering policy of the explosive. The working day 
in a month is 30.
Solution
Given data: Demand (d) = 3000 kg/month = 300 kg/day
 Ordering cost (K) = US$400 per order
 Holding cost (h) = US$0.1 per kg per day
 Shortage cost (p) = US$4 per kg per day
The demand or consumption rate is a random variable, X, which follows uniform distribution in the 
range of 0 to 200 kg. The pdf for the random variable, X, can be determined as

10 Queuing theory and its 
application in mines
10.1 INTRODUCTION
Queue is a common phenomenon in mining. When multiple dump trucks come to the loading point, 
due to the limited number of loaders, dump truck needs to wait when other trucks are either being 
loaded or are waiting for the loader. The long waiting time of trucks or any other mining machines 
may incur a significant financial loss. Queuing theory deals with the optimization of the service and 
waiting time through mathematical models. Queues contain customers (or ‘items’) such as dump 
trucks.
Queuing theory is applicable to optimize the combination of various machines. For example, in 
a particular mining operation, the number of dump trucks needs to be allocated for a single shovel 
such that the maximum utilization of both the dump trucks and shovel can be achieved, and thus, 
the overall operating cost can be reduced. There are two kinds of costs involved in optimizing the 
queuing problem: waiting cost and service cost. The typical characteristics of waiting and service 
cost are shown in Figure 10.1.
To evaluate a queuing system, the characteristics of the arrival patterns, service times, and service 
disciplines need to be identified. All these processes (arrival patterns and service times) are gener￾ally stochastic. The components of a queuing system are:
• Arrival pattern: This denotes the nature of the arrival of the machines in a service station. 
For example, how a truck is coming to the working bench for being loaded or how a truck 
is arriving at the waste dump site to unload the waste materials. The arrival process can be 
characterized by the distribution of the inter-arrival times of the mining machines. Usually, 
it is assumed that the inter-arrival times are independent and have a common distribution. 
However, in many practical situations, machines arrive according to a Poisson distribution 
(i.e., exponential inter-arrival times).
• Service: This indicates the nature or capacity of service offers by the server. For example, how 
an electric shovel is loading a truck on the working bench. Service time is a random variable 
and follows a typical probability distribution like exponential distribution. Thus, the service 
times are independent and identically distributed and independent of the inter-arrival times of 
machines.
• Server: This indicates the nature of the service facility in the system. A system can have a 
single server or a group of servers that offer the service to customers. For example, there might 
be separate loading shovels for ore and waste materials in an open-pit bench face.
• Queuing capacity: It indicates the capacity of the queue where customers (dump trucks) can 
wait to get the service. The waiting line may have the infinite capacity or finite capacity.
• Size of the calling population: The population of customers (dump trucks) can be assumed to 
be finite or infinite in a queuing model. In a finite calling population queuing model, the arrival 
rate depends on the number of customers being served and waiting. On the other hand, in the 
infinite calling population queuing model, the arrival rate does not depend on the number of 
customers being served and waiting as there is a large number of potential customers exists 
in the system.322 Optimization techniques and their applications
322
• The service discipline: In any system, the customers can be served one by one or in groups. 
The order of entering into the service facility and leaving the facility can have multiple options, 
as follows:
• First In First Out (FIFO): Customers arrive first and leave earlier.
• Last In First Out (LIFO): Customers comes later but leaves earlier.
• Service In Random Order (SIRO): Customer is selected randomly for the service.
• Priority-based service (PQ): A particular type of customer gets priority-based service.
10.2 KENDALL NOTATION
Kendall (1953) introduced an abbreviated notation to represent the different types of queuing 
models. Kendall’s notation for a queuing system is given by
(a b/ / c d ) : / ( e f / )
Where
a: Arrival patterns,
b: Service patterns,
c: number of servers,
d: capacity of the queue,
e: size of the calling population,
f: queue or service discipline.,
The queuing parameters mentioned in the left side of the colon (:) are always defined to indicate the 
characteristics of the queuing model, but the parameters mentioned after the colon are not mandatory 
to define for default characteristics. The codes used to describe the different queuing characteristics 
are as follows:
Arrival patterns (a)
Markovian or memoryless (M) – Poisson arrival process, which has exponential inter￾arrival times.
Degenerate distribution (D) – A deterministic or fixed inter-arrival time.
Erlang distribution (Ek
) – An Erlang distribution with k as the shape parameter.
General distribution (G) – It usually refers to independent arrivals.
FIGURE 10.1 Characteristics of a Queuing System.Queuing theory and its application in mines 323
Service patterns (b)
The codes used for representing the distribution of the service times are similar to that of arrival 
patterns like M, D, Ek
, or G. But, in a typical queuing model, the distribution of arrival pattern 
and service pattern may be different.
Number of the server (c)
The number of servers in a queuing system is represented by a natural number, n. (n = 1, 2, …, n).
Capacity of the queue (d)
The maximum number of customers or dump trucks allowed in a queue may be finite or infinite. The 
finite capacity is represented by a finite number N, and the infinite capacity is represented by ∞.
Size of the calling population (e)
The finite calling population of customers (dump trucks) is by a finite number N, and the infinite 
capacity is represented by ∞.
Queue or service discipline (f)
The service discipline is denoted by FIFO, LIFO, SIRO, and PQ.
In a basic model, only the first three notations are used to explain the type of model, and the rest 
three are assumed to be default types. The default type of fourth, fifth, and sixth letters are infinite 
queue capacity (N), and infinite size of calling population (∞), and FIFO (Gautam, 2007). Any 
system that has infinite queue capacity means customers arrive one by one, and they are always 
allowed to enter into the system. The system has an infinite population size means there is no end 
for the customers. FIFO service indicates there are no priority rules, and customers are served 
in order of their arrival. Some examples are M/M/1, M/M/c, M/G/1, G/M/1, and M/D/1. If any of 
these assumptions do not hold, the notation is extended with an extra letter to indicate the nature 
of queuing models. For example, a system with exponential inter-arrival times, exponential service

10.3 PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS COMMONLY USED 
IN QUEUING MODELS
In most queuing systems, arrivals occur randomly. Randomness means that the occurrence of an 
event (arrival of a dump truck or loading by a shovel) is not influenced by the amount of time that 
has elapsed since the last event. Random inter-arrival and service times are described quantita￾tively in queuing models by different distributions. Geometric, Poisson, Exponential, and Erlang 
distributions are commonly used distributions in queuing models. Here, these distributions are 
briefly described. To know more about the distribution, please refer to Probability and Statistics 
(Chapter 2).
10.3.1 Geometric distribution
The geometric distribution is either one of two discrete probability distributions. A geometric 
random variable, T with parameter p has a probability distribution
P T n p p n n ( = ) = − (1 ) , , = … 012, ,324 Optimization techniques and their applications

For geometric distribution, the mean is equal to
Mean = ( ) = − E T p

For Poisson distribution, the mean can be presented as:

10.3.3  Exponential distribution
The density function of an exponential distribution with parameter μ is given by
f T e T T ( ) = ≥ − λ λ , 0
For the exponential distribution, we have

An important property of an exponential distribution is the memoryless property (Refer Section 2.6 
of Chapter 2). The memory property of the exponential distribution implies that
P T{ } > +t t ∆ > T t ∆ = > P T{ }t
10.3.4  Erlang distribution
The Erlang distribution is the sum of k independent random variables T1
, T2

, which have a 
common exponential distribution with a mean of 1/λ. It is a two-parameter [shape (k) and rate (λ)] 
continuous probability distribution function. The Erlang distribution with shape parameter, k = 1 
simplifies to the exponential distribution. The probability density function of an Erlang distribution

10.4 RELATION BETWEEN THE EXPONENTIAL AND POISSON 
DISTRIBUTIONS
If the inter-arrival time, T is exponential and the arrival rate is λ (i.e., λ customers are arriving per 
unit time) (shown in Figure 10.2), then the probability of no arrivals during a period of time t can 
be determined as
p t P t P T t e e t t
0 ( ) = > [ ] = −1 1 [ ] ≤ = − ( ) 1− = − − T λ λ
Where, p t 0 ( ) = probability of no arrival of the customer during the time t.

[The higher-order terms are significantly small and close to zero, and thus deleted]
The exponential distribution is based on the assumption that during ∆t > 0, at most, one arrival 
can occur. Thus, as ∆t→0, the probability of one arrival in ∆t time is given by
p t p t t 1 0 (∆ ∆ ) = −1 ( ) = λ∆
This indicates that the probability of arrival during ∆t is directly proportional to ∆t, with the arrival 
rate, λ, being the constant of proportionality.
Let p t N ( ) = probability of N arrival during a period t.
For a sufficiently small ∆t > 0, it is assumed that at most, one arrival can occur during a very 
small period ∆t follows an exponential distribution. Therefore, the probability of n-customer in the 
system is given by
p t t p t p t N N N ( + ) = ( ) + ( ) − ∆ ∆ * * noarrival during t time

ing t ∆ time, N > 0 (10.1)
The above equation indicates that there are two possibilities of N arrival occurrence during t t + ∆ . 
These are either N arrivals that occurred during t and no arrivals during ∆t, and N – 1 arrivals 
occurred during t and one that occurred during ∆t.

Eq. (10.6) represents Poisson distribution with the mean number of arrival during t is

Thus, the results indicate that if the time between arrivals is exponential with mean 1/λ, then the 
number of arrivals during a specific period t is Poisson with mean λt. The vice-versa is also true.
The summarized relationship between the exponential and Poisson, given the arrival rate (λ) is 
shown in Table 10.1.

10.5 LITTLE’S LAW
In queuing theory, Little’s law established the relationship between the mean number of customers 
waiting in a stationary queuing system (Ls
), the average waiting time of a customer within a system 
(Ws
) and the average number of customer arriving at the system per unit of time (λ) (Little, 1961).
Mathematically, it can be represented as:
L W s s = λ (10.7)
The relationship represented in Eq. (10.7) is not influenced by the arrival patterns, the service 
pattern, the service discipline, and so on (Simchi-Levi and Trick, 2013). The law assumes that the 
capacity of the system is sufficient to deal with the customers. It means that the number of customers 
in the system does not grow to infinity.
Example 10.1
In a mine, the dump trucks are arriving at a rate of 6 per hour in the washing chamber for cleaning. 
Thus, the average time a dump truck spends is around 6 minutes for washing. Determine the average 
number of dump trucks queuing for washing by applying Little’s law.
Solution
Given data:
Mean arrival rate (λ) = 6 dump trucks per hour
The average waiting time in the system (Ws
) = 20 minutes = 1/3 hour
∴The average number of dump trucks in the system( ) L W = = * = s s λ 6 1

Therefore, the average number of trucks in the queue is 2.
10.6 QUEUING MODEL
10.6.1  M/​M/1 Model
M/M/1 is one of the basic queuing models in which the distributions of the inter-arrival times and 
distribution of service times are considered to be exponential distribution. In this model, the number 
of servers is one. In open-pit mines, this type of queuing characteristic is commonly observed in the 
loading face where only one loader is deployed to load the excavated material into the dump truck 
(Figure 10.3). The dump trucks are arriving from an infinite population following a single channel 
queue for being loaded by the loader. The loader offers the service on a first-come, first-serve basis, 
that the dump truck arrives first, gets loaded first, and exits the system. Thus, the characteristics of 
the M/M/1 queuing model is described below:
Characteristics of the M/M/1 model
• Inter-arrival times of dump truck follow exponential distribution function with mean arrival 
rate is λ per unit time.
• Service times of the loader follow exponential distribution function with mean service rate is 
μ per unit time.328 Optimization techniques and their applications
328
• The number of loaders deployed in the face for loading operation is 1.
• Queuing capacity is infinite; that is, all the dump trucks that arrive at the loading point can 
wait in the queue for being loaded.
• Dump trucks are assumed to be coming from an infinite population.
• Dump trucks are served on a FIFO basis.
The basic assumption of the model is that the mean service (loading) rate is more than the mean 
arrival rate of dump trucks (μ > λ) to avoid the infinite queue length. The condition can be represented 
mathematically as follows:
ρ
λ
µ
= < 1; (10.8)
where, ρ is the fraction of time the loader is busy.
10.6.1.1 Time-dependent behaviour of the flows of dump trucks
The exponential distribution has the memory-less property, and thus the future arrival time does not 
depend on the past arrival of the dump trucks. An exponential distribution offers a simple description 
of the state of the system at time t, like the number of trucks in the loading system in an open-pit 
mining bench (number of trucks waiting in the queue and the one being served by shovel). The flow 
behaviour of dump trucks in an M/M/1 queuing system is shown in Figure 10.4.
Let p t N ( )= probability of N dump trucks arrives during a period of time t.
For a sufficiently small ∆t>0, it is assumed that at most one arrival and one exit can occur during 
a very small period Δt, following an exponential distribution. Therefore, the probability of N-dump 
trucks in the loading point is given by
p t t p t t t N N ( + ∆ ∆ ) = ( )* * no arrival during time no leaving during ∆ time +
( ) p t − * * t t N 1 one arrival during ∆ ∆ time no leaving during time + ( ) + p t
t t N 1 *
no arrival during ∆ ∆ time * one leaving during time, N > 0
(10.9)
The above equation indicates that there are three possibilities of N arrival occurrence of dump trucks 
during t+Δt. These are N arrivals occurred during t, and zero arrival and zero exits of dump truck 
occurred during ∆t, N–1 arrivals occurred during t, and one arrival and zero exits of dump truck 
occurred during ∆t, and N+1 arrivals occurred during t, and zero arrival and one exit of dump 
truck occurred during ∆t.
Therefore, Eq. (10.9) can be rewritten as:

The differential Eq. (10.12) and Eq. (10.13) cannot be solved using a simple method. For a detailed 
solution to derive the state probabilities p t n ( ), refer to the literature of Kleinrock (1975). It is 
observed that the simplest queuing models lead to a complex equation for the time-dependent behav￾iour to determine the state probabilities. Thus, the limiting (or equilibrium) behaviour approach is 
used for solving the differential equations.
The characteristics of the equilibrium behaviour are that the rate of change of the number of 
dump trucks in the loading point of mine is tending to zero, and the probability of the number of 
customers in a typical system is constant with time. These can be mathematically represented as 
t →∞, p t N
′ ( ) → 0 and p t p N N ( )→ . Hence, Eq. (10.12) and Eq. (10.13) become:

states that the fraction of dump trucks finding on arrival N customers in the system is equal to the

servers (loaders) deployed to provide service. All other characteristics remain the same as that of 
the M/M/1 model. In M/M/s model, the number of servers is more than 1. In an open-pit mine, if 
two shovels are deployed in the same face for loading the trucks one after another, then M/M/s 
queuing system should be followed for optimizing the system. A typical queuing characteristics M/
M/s model is shown in Figure 10.5. In this type of model also a single-channel queue is followed. 
Thus, the characteristics of the M/M/ s queuing model is described below:
• Inter-arrival times of dump truck follow exponential distribution function with mean arrival 
rate is λ per unit time.
• Service times of the loader follow exponential distribution function with mean service rate is 
μ per unit time.
• The number of loaders deployed in the face for loading operation is s.
• Queuing capacity is infinite, that is, all the dump truck arrives in the loading point can wait in 
the queue for being loaded.
FIGURE 10.5 Queue discipline in M/M/s queuing model.Queuing theory and its application in mines 335
• Dump trucks are assumed to be coming from an infinite population.
• Dump trucks are served on a FIFO basis.
The basic assumption of the model is that the service rate of s identical servers is more than that 
of the arrival rate of customers in order to avoid the infinite queue length. The condition can be 
represented mathematically as follows:
ρ
λ
µ
= <
s
1 (10.27)
In the above equation, ρ is the fraction of time the server is busy.
Let pn denote the probability of n dump trucks in the queuing system (loading point). The 
flow behaviour of dump trucks at the loading point is shown in Figure 10.6. In the M/M/s 
queuing model, the arrival rate is constant with time and calling population, but the service 
rate varies and depends on the number of dump trucks at the loading point. Assuming the 
number of servers (loaders) deployed in the system is s, the service rate is nµ if n is less than 
s and nµ if n is greater and equal to s (shown in Figure 10.6). Mathematically, these can be 
represented as
Mean arrival rate = = λ λ … = λ λ = 1 2 N

At equilibrium conditions, the probability equations can be derived similarly to that of the M/M/1 
model. Instead of equating the flow into and out of a single state n, the equilibrium equations can be 
derived by equating the flow in and out of different states {0, 1, , N}. The flow that occurs in state 
n depends on the two neighboring states (n – 1) and (n+1). At equilibrium condition,
Expected rate of inflow to state N = λ µ NN NN p p −− ++ + 11 11
Similarly, the expected rate of outflow from state N = λ µ NN NN p p +
In the equilibrium state, the rate of inflow should be equal to the rate of outflow. Mathematically, 
this can be written as:
Rate of inflow = Rate of outflow

opencast mine face in the following condition. It is observed that approximately 16 dump trucks per 
hour arrive in the loading face. The duration of loading a dump truck is approximately exponentially 
distributed with a mean of 5 minutes. How many loaders are needed such that the mean waiting time

With two shovels, the average waiting time is 4 minutes, which is less than desired upper bound 
of waiting time of 5 minutes. Hence, the deployment of two shovels is sufficient for loading 
operations.Queuing theory and its application in mines 339
Example 10.5
In a production bench, two shovels are deployed for loading the blasted material into dump trucks. 
Each shovel loads one dump truck at a time separately. When both shovels are occupied, the new 
arriving dump truck waits for their turn. The loading time is exponentially distributed with an 
average loading time of 3 minutes. Dump trucks arrive at the loading point according to a Poisson 
process with a rate of 20 dump trucks per hour.
a. Calculate the probability of N dump trucks at the loading point (waiting plus under loading), 
N = 0, 1, 2, ….
b. Calculate the mean waiting time and mean number of dump trucks waiting at the loading point.
c. Determine the proportion of dump trucks who find both loaders are busy on arrival.
d. Determine the number of shovels for restricting the proportion of dump trucks who find all 
loaders are busy on arrival to at most 20%.

Similarly, the average waiting time in the queue at the first unloading platform is 7.5 minutes,

Thus, the average waiting time in the new queuing system is 0.18 minutes, and the average

It is clear from the results that two platforms with a single queue significantly reduce, the queue’s 
length, and waiting time in the queue from two independent platforms with two different queues. 
Thus, in this case, the second option (M/M/s) queuing system offers more efficient and economical 
operation than the two independent M/M/1 queuing systems.
10.6.3  Infinite server queue model (M/​M/∞)
The number of servers in the M/M/∞ queuing model is unlimited, unlike M/M/1 and M/M/s
queuing models. This type of model is also called a self-service queuing model. In mines, this type 
of model can be observed when the dump truck operator does the self-checking in the workshop, 
dump trucks unloading the overburden at the dumpsite without any space restriction, etc. In this type 
of model also a single-channel queue is followed, but dump trucks do not have to wait for getting 
the service as there is an infinite number of servers that exist. A typical queuing characteristic M/
M/∞ model is shown in Figure 10.7. The model is explained with the example that the dump trucks 
are unloading the overburdened material in the external dumpsite, where no restriction of space for 
unloading the material exists.
The characteristics of the M/M/∞ model are as follows:
• Inter-arrival times of dump truck follow exponential distribution function with mean arrival 
rate is λ per unit time.
• Unloading times follow exponential distribution function with mean service rate is μ per 
unit time.
• The number of servers is infinity.
• Queuing capacity is infinite, that is, all the dump truck arrives in the loading point can get 
a space.
• Dump trucks are assumed to be coming from an infinite population.
The flow of customers in this type of system is represented in Figure 10.8.
In M/M/∞ type queuing model,
Mean arrival rate for N N state th
N = = λ λ, , = … 012, , (10.39)
Mean service rate for N N th state N N = = µ µ, , = … 012, , (10.40)
As the number of servers is infinity, the service rate is equal to the number of dump trucks in the 
system. Any dump truck will immediately get the service on arrival, and no need to wait for getting 
the service.
FIGURE 10.7 Arrival and Service Pattern of M/M/∞ Queuing Model.Queuing theory and its application in mines 345

The average performance measures for M/M/∞ model can be determined as follows:
• The average number of dump trucks in the queue: The average number of customers in 
the queue, Lq
 is zero as there is an infinite number of servers exist in the system. Any customer 
gets service immediately after arrival into the system.
Lq = 0 [Number of servers are infinite and thus waiting time in the queue is zero]

Wq = 0
10.6.4 (M/​M/s): (FCFS)/​K/​K queuing system
This model is a limited source model, where only K dump trucks can accommodate the service 
stations (loading point, workshop, etc.). This type of queuing model is called the machine repair 
model or the cyclic queue model. The model is demonstrated with the example of a limited repair 
facility available for the dump trucks at the mine workshop, as shown in Figure 10.9. This type of 
model considers a finite source model, in which arrivals are drawn from a small population. In the 
finite source model, the arrival of dump trucks in the repair facility depends on the number of dump 
trucks deployed in the system, unlike an infinite source model, where the arrivals are independent of 
the number of dump trucks in the system.
FIGURE 10.9 Flow of customer in machine repairing model.Queuing theory and its application in mines 347
This model can be represented as M/M/s/G/K/K queue system. The characteristics of the queuing 
system are as follows:
• The breakdown occurrence of dump trucks is a Poisson process, and the distribution of time 
interval of the breakdown follows an exponential distribution with a mean breakdown rate is 
λ per unit time. Moreover, once the dump truck gets breakdown, the same arrives at the repair 
facility, and hence the inter-arrival times of dump trucks at the repair facility also follow expo￾nential distribution function with a mean arrival rate is λ per unit time.
• Service times of the repair follow exponential distribution function with mean service rate is μ 
per unit time. It is assumed that all the service persons are equally efficient.
• The number of repair-persons employed in the workshop is s.
• Queuing capacity is finite, N. That is, a limited number of dump truck arrives in the workshop 
can wait in the queue for repair.
• Dump trucks are assumed to be coming from a finite population, K.
• Dump trucks are served on a FIFO basis.
Let there be N dump trucks in the repair facility (system), and hence K-N dump trucks are in the 
operational area of the mine.
Let T is the time until the breakdown of the dump truck occurs among the operating dump truck 
population (K–N). T is exponentially distributed with parameter (K-​N).
The arrival occurs in the Poisson process with mean (K N− )λ when N dump trucks are in the 
repair facility.

The value of µ N can be determined by looking at the number of repair workers currently in repair 
service. If a truck breaks down occurs when all servers are busy, it has to wait in the queue to be 
repaired. Each occupied repair worker completes repairs with mean service rate μ. For N number of 
dump trucks at the repair facility, the service rate µ N can be determined as follows:

Example 10.8
A mine has deployed 20 dump trucks for transportation of blasted materials from the working face. 
A dump truck requires service once every 16 days. The mine has two repair-persons at the workshop 
in each shift, who take an average of 12 hours to repair a dump truck. The times between two con￾secutive breakdown and repair times follow exponential distributions.
a. Find the average number of dump trucks in good condition.
b. Find the average downtime for a shovel that needs repair.
c. Find the fraction of the time a particular service engineer is idle.
Solution
Given data:
Number of dump trucks (K) = 20
Number of repair persons (s) = 2
Rate of the arrival of dump trucks at repair facility (λ) = 20/16 per day = 1.25 per day

10.7 COST MODELS
There are mainly two types of the cost involves in a queuing system. These are the cost for pro￾viding service and not providing any service (i.e., waiting time cost). These two types of costs are 
conflicting. Increasing the cost of one will automatically decrease the cost of another. The trend 
of the cost curve is demonstrated in Figure 10.10. The objective is to minimize the total expected 
system cost
Minimum ETC E = + OC EWC (10.54)
FIGURE 10.10 Cost characteristics of a queuing system.352 Optimization techniques and their applications
352
where
ETC = Expected total cost per unit time
ESC = Expected cost of operating the facility per unit time
EWC = Expected cost of waiting per unit time
The expected waiting cost depends on the number of customers in the system, Ls
. If Cw is the 
waiting cost per dump truck per unit time, the total expected waiting cost (EWC) can be determined as
EWC C Lw s =
On the other hand, the expected service cost depends on the number of servers and their service rate. 
Let the number of servers is s and the service rate is µ. If the service cost per server per unit time is 
Cs
, the total expected service cost (ESC) can be determined as
ESC sCs = (µ)
The service cost of a server, Cs
 is a function of service rate, µ
∴ETC C = + L sC ( ) w s s µ (10.55)
The following examples illustrate the use of the cost model.
Example 10.9
A shovel deployed in a production face for loading operation where dump trucks arrive according to 
a Poisson distribution with a rate of 10 dump trucks per hour. The loading times are exponentially 
distributed with a mean of 1/μ hours. The shovel operator charges US$0.5μ per hour, and the waiting 
cost of the dump truck is US$2 per dump truck per hour. Determine the loading rate μ for which the 
average cost per hour is minimum.
Solution
Given data:
Mean arrival rate of dump truck (λ)= 10 per hour
Mean loading time = 1/ μ hours
∴Mean loading rate (μ) = μ per hour
Service cost per unit of the shovel (Cs
) = US$0.5μ per hour
Cost of waiting per dump truck (Cw) = US$2 per hour
The queuing system is an M/M/1 system.
We have,
Average cost per hour = = ETC C L s + C ( ) w s s µ
For one shovel, s = 1
∴ = + ( ) = ( − ) ETC C L sC + w s s µ * * λ

The above equation holds true with µ = 6.4 and 14.2.
Since µ should be greater than λ, therefore µ = 14.2 is acceptable. Thus, the minimum cost 
( ) ETCmin is achieved with a loading rate of 14.2 dump trucks per hour. The cost of ETC with 
different service rates is also summarized in Figure 10.11. It is observed that the total expected cost 
is minimum for µ = 14.2.
Example 10.10
A mine has six shovels for loading operations. The time until the breakdown of a shovel occurs 
exponential, with a mean of 100 hours. The time to repair a shovel is exponentially distributed 
with a mean of 10 hours. The repair cost is US$30 per hour. The cost due to loss of operating time

Example 10.11
The owner of an iron ore mine is in the process of purchasing a loader (shovel) for loading oper￾ation in the opencast production benches. Vendors have proposed four models whose capacity are

Dump trucks arrive at the bench according to a Poisson distribution with a mean of eight dump 
trucks per hour. The waiting cost of the dump truck is $10 per dump truck per hour. If each model 
has equal failure probability, which shovel should be purchased for minimizing the operational and 
waiting cost?
Solution
Let the EOCi
 is the expected operating cost of the loader of ith model/brand, and EWCi
 is the 
corresponding expected waiting cost of dump trucks. The total expected cost per hour associated 
with ith type of loader is

The values of C1

dump truck can be treated as an (M/M/1): (FCFS/∞/∞) model for all practical purposes. The arrival 
rate is λ = 10 dump trucks/hour. The expected number of dump trucks in the loading point with 
different loading rates are shown in Table 10.3.

10.8 CASE STUDY FOR THE APPLICATION OF QUEUING THEORY FOR 
SHOVEL-TRUCK OPTIMIZATION IN AN OPEN-PIT MINE
An open-pit iron ore mine located in Odisha, India, is planning to optimize the material haulage 
system for minimizing the cost. The loading and transportations of ores from face to the pro￾cessing plant are one of the key operations. These activities incur a significant share of the total 
operating costs of the mine. This case study demonstrates the applications of queuing theory for 
optimizing the number of trucks required to deploy for a specified number of shovels used for 
loading operations at the production pit. The nature of these activities depends on the cycle time of 
shovel and trucks. Trucks generally arrive at the production pit in a random fashion. Additionally, 
the loading times of the shovels are also a random variable. The system deploys one shovel (10 m3
capacity) and 22 trucks (60 m3
 capacity each) to load and transport ore from face to plant. The 
production capacity of ore in a shift from one production pit is 4000 tonnes. The distance between 
the production pit to the stockpile is 3 km. The loading (or service) time of the shovel and inter￾arrival time of dump trucks at the production pit are also random variables. These data need to be 
monitored in the mines for a specific period for determining the average service time and inter￾arrival time. The sample field data (arrival times and loading times) from the case study mine are 
reported in Table 10.5.

The average inter-arrival time and service time are determined from the observed data (Table 10.5) 
as 3.07 minutes and 5.30 minutes, respectively. The inter-arrival rate and service rate can be 
determined using the following equations.

The distributions of the observed inter-arrival times and loading times (Table 10.5) should be 
examined for estimating the best-fit probability density function (PDF). The outliers in the data 
should be removed before estimating the best PDF. After removal of outliers, the best fit PDF can be 
estimated by using any of the software like SPSS, SYSTAT, MATLAB, etc. Here, the data is fitted 
with the exponential probability density function using MATLAB software with good accuracy, as 
shown in Figure 10.12. However, most mining applications are highly complex, and accurate fitting 
of the observed data is important for queuing analysis. The probability density function for inter￾arrival distribution and service time distribution is estimated as follows:

Determining the Model Performance Measures
The model performance measures of the model are determined by considering exponential inter￾arrival times and service times. The number of shovels deployed at the loading point is one. The 
calling population is limited with a maximum of 22 trucks, and thus maximum queue capacity at the 
loading point is 22 trucks. Therefore, the type of queuing model is (M/M/1): (FCFS/K/K). This is a

machine repair queuing model with one service facility, as explained in Section 10.6.4. Therefore, 
the various model performance measures i.e., idle time of the shovel (P0
), the mean number of 
trucks waiting in the system (Ls
), the mean number of trucks waiting in queue (Lq), waiting time in 
the queue (Wq
), waiting time in the system (Ws

), cost 
incurred in per unit material handling (Ct

The hourly cost of shovel and truck are US$200 per unit and US$150 per unit, respectively at this mine. 
Here, the number of trucks needed to be optimized for one shovel and hence S = 1 and N = 1, 2,…,22.
Results and discussion
The various performance measures like idle time of the shovel (P0
), the mean number of trucks 
waiting in the system (Ls
), the mean number of trucks waiting in queue (Lq
), waiting time in the 
queue (Wq
), waiting time in the system (Ws
), shovel utilization (ηs ), truck utilization (ηt
), cost 
incurred in per unit material handling (Ct
), and total production (Qn) of the defined queuing system 
are listed in Table 10.6. The graphical representation of different performance measures with the 
number of trucks deployed are represented in Figures 10.13–10.18.
The decision on the number of trucks needed to deploy for optimizing the cost of haulage system 
should be made based on the integration of the key performance measures like utilization of shovel 
and trucks, cost per unit haul of material, production in a specific duration, waiting time of the 
trucks, etc. It can be observed from Figure 10.18 that the production level is increasing significantly 
by increasing the number of trucks up to 5, and thereafter it becomes constant. Thus, deployment of 
more than 5-trucks unnecessarily increases the waiting time and cost per unit production. 
Figure 10.16 reveals that the probability of zero trucks at the loading point is almost equal to zero 
with five trucks. It can be observed from Figure 10.15 that the utilization of shovels is increasing 
with the increase in the number of trucks and reached 100% with the deployment of 5 trucks. At 
the same time, the utilizations of the trucks are continuously decreasing with increasing the number 
of trucks. It can be observed that increasing the number of trucks after five does not have any further 
scope of increasing the utilization of the shovel. On the other hand, the deployment of more 
than five trucks increases the number of trucks in the queue (Figure 10.14), and hence the waiting

time (Figure 10.13) of each truck is also increased. On the other side, the deployment of fewer than 
five trucks may reduce the utilization of the shovel as the chance of zero trucks at the loading point 
is increased. Figure 10.17 indicates that the unit cost of material haul is also increasing with the 
increase in the number of trucks. Thus, the number of trucks should deploy as minimum as possible 
with maximum achievable production. It should be noted that the deployment of one shovel 
facilitates the target production of the mine. If the target production is higher than the maximum 
production capacity of one shovel, more number of shovel need to deploy and accordingly the model 
performance measure need to be analysed.

EXERCISE 10
Q1. It is observed that the arrival of mine trucks in the workshop for repair follows a Poisson 
distribution with mean arrival rate of 12 per 8-hour shift. The time spent to repair mine 
trucks by a serviceman in the mine workshop follows exponential distribution with a mean 
of 60 minutes. If the service offers in the order FCFS basis, determine the expected idle

11 Non-linear algorithms for 
mining systems
11.1 INTRODUCTION
A program is said to be non-linear if either the objective function or at least one constraint is non￾linear. The similarity of a non-linear program with the linear program is that both consist of an 
objective function, generalized constraints, and the bound of the variables. Most of the real systems 
are inherently non-linear. This chapter demonstrates different characteristics of nonlinear programs 
and their solution algorithms. It is always difficult to obtain an optimal solution of a non-linear 
program due to the following reasons:
• It is difficult to distinguish the local optimum and global optimum solutions.
• It is not mandatory that extreme points always represent the optimal solution as in the linear 
programming.
• An optimal solution depends on the consideration of the initial solution.
• Different algorithms may provide different solutions.
11.2 STATIONARY POINTS
The function Z f = (x) (shown in Figure 11.1) has five stationary points, which occur when the 
slope of f x( ) is zero. Stationary points are thus identified by solutions to Eq. (11.1).
df x
dx
( ) = 0 (11.1)
Stationary points may be local minima x x, 2 5 ( ), maxima x x 1 4 ( ) , or saddle points x3 ( ). The local 
optima are likely candidates for a global optimum.
Local Maximum and Global Maximum
The given function f x( ) has a local maximum at x1
, as the value of the function at x1
 is higher than 
at any other point of x in the neighbourhood of x1
. If the function f x( ) has a local maximum at x1,
then the following condition should satisfy.
f x x fx fx x 1 1 1 1 1 ( ) − ∆ ∆ < ( ) > + ( )
A local maximum can be the candidate for global maximum.
The given function f x( ) has a global maximum at x4
 in the range of a< x <b because the value of 
the function is highest as compared to the value at any other point in the defined range.
Local Minimum and Global Minimum
The given function f x( ) has a local minimum at x2
, as the value of the function at x2
 is lower than at 
any other point of x in the neighbourhood of x2
. If the function f x( ) has a local maximum at x2, then 
the following condition should satisfy.
f x x fx fx x 2 2 2 2 2 ( ) − ∆ ∆ > ( ) < + ( )368 Optimization techniques and their applications
368
A local minimum can be the candidate for global minimum.
The given function f x( ) has a global minimum at x5
 in the range of a< x <b because the value of 
the function is lowest as compared to the value at any other point in the defined range.
Saddle point
The given function f x( ) has a saddle point at x3
, as the value of the function at x3
 is lower than any 
other neighbourhood point on one side and higher on the other. The slope of the function, f x( ), at 
any saddle point is equal to zero. If the function f x( ) has a saddle point at x3, then the following 
condition should satisfy.
f x x fx fx x 3 3 3 3 3 ( ) − ∆ ∆ < ( ) < + ( )
Convexity
If the slope of any function, f x( ) increases continuously, the function f x( ) is convex. The condition 
of convex function can be represented as
d f
dx
2
2 ≥ 0
If all the eigenvalues of the function are positive, the function is strictly convex.
Concavity
If the slope of any function, f x( ) decreases continuously, the function f x( ) is concave. The condi￾tion of concave function can be represented as
∂
∂
≤ 2
2 0 f
x
If all the eigenvalues of the function are negative, the function is strictly concave.
11.3 CLASSIFICATIONS OF NON-LINEAR PROGRAMMING
11.3.1  Unconstrained optimization algorithm for solving non-linear problems
If the optimization problem has an objective function without any restrictions of the variables, the 
problem is referred to as an unconstrained optimization problem. Moreover, if the nature of the 
objective function is non-linear, the problem is called an unconstrained non-linear optimization 
problem.

Let f x( ) is a function of multiple variables, X x ,,, x xn = … ( ) 1 2 . A necessary condition for a sta￾tionary point, X is that each first partial derivative of f x( ) should be equal to zero.

The length of the first derivative indicates the rate of increase of the value of the function in the dir￾ection of the gradient. The next challenging task is to identify the stationary points which offer the 
local minimum or local maximum, or saddle point. In the case of single-variable function, the value 
of the double derivative of the function at different stationary points helps in identifying local max￾imum or local minimum. In the case of a multi-variable function, this is done by the Hessian matrix. 
The Hessian matrix is a square matrix, formed by the double derivatives of the function as follows:

In the next step, the Hessian matrix is used to determine the eigenvalue of the matrix using the 
following Eq. 11.1:
H * V V = λ * (11.2)
In Eq. (11.1), H is nxn Hessian matrix, V is non-zero n x1 vector, and λ is a scalar quantity. The 
value of λ, which offers the solution of Eq. (11.2), is the eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix. The 
vector, V, which corresponds to this value, is called an eigenvector. The above equation can 
be rewritten as
H * * V V − = λ 0
H *V = = λ*I*V 0
Where, I is an identity matrix of the same order as that of the Hessian matrix.

Solve Eq. (11.3) for determining the values of λ at different stationary points. These values represent 
the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The criteria for examining the minimum and maximum of a 
non-linear function at X are as follows:
• If all eigenvalues are positive at X X = 0
, the function has a local minimum at X0
. Moreover, if 
all the eigenvalues are positive for all possible values of X X = 0
, then the function has a global 
minimum at X0
.
• If all eigenvalues are negative at X X = 0
, the function has a local maximum at X0
. Moreover, 
if all the eigenvalues are negative for all possible values of X X = 0
, then the function has a 
global maximum at X0
.
• If some eigenvalues are positive and some are negative, or some are zero at X X = 0
, then the 
function has neither a local maximum local minimum at X0
.
The algorithm is applied to solve the problem demonstrated in Example 11.1.

It should be noted that the objective function and constraints are continuous and differentiable. The 
constraint limits b1
, b2
 ….bm are constants, and the decision variables x1
, x2
, …,xn
 may be either posi￾tive or negative. It must also be assumed that solutions to the model are bounded (i.e., the optimal 
value of f x( ) is not infinite).
The method of Lagrange multipliers can be used to determine the stationary points. The method is 
used to the problem having equality constraints. The conditions for stationary points are derived by 
multiplying each equality constraint by a Lagrange multiplier, λi, and subtracting from the objective 
function as follows:

Solution of these (n+m) equations will identify stationary points of the objective function, H. The 
values or roots of Lagrange’s multiplier can be used to determine the minimum and maximum of 
the objective function at different stationary points. The conditions for examining the maximization 
and minimization are as follows:
• If each root of λ at X X = 0
 is negative, the function has local maximum at X0
. Moreover, if 
each root of λ is negative and independent of X, the function has a global maximum at X0
.
• If each root of λ at X X = 0
 is positive, the function has local minimum at X0
. Moreover, if each 
root of λ is positive and independent of X, the function has a global minimum at X0
.
• If some roots of λ are positive and some are negative at X X = 0
, then the function has neither 
a local maximum nor a local minimum at X0
.
The algorithm is applied to solve the problem demonstrated in Example 11.2.

The Lagrange multiplier approach can be extended to solve nonlinear programming problems with 
inequality constraints. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions can be used to determine the 
stationary points. The KKT necessary conditions for maximization/minimization are explained in 
Table 11.2.
The method for solving a non-linear optimization problem with inequality constraints is explained 
in Example 11.3.
Example 11.3
The inventory in a mining workshop has an area of 2000 sq. ft. for storage of truck tires. The demand 
for tires in the mines is two units per day. The ordering cost of tires is US$300 per order, and the 
holding cost is US$0.01 per unit per day. The purchasing cost is US$600 per unit. The average space 
required to the tire is 12 sq. ft. per unit. Determine the optimal inventory plan.

Before deriving the revised objective function, the inequality constraints should be converted into

11.4 CASE STUDY ON THE APPLICATION OF NON-LINEAR OPTIMIZATION 
FOR OPEN-PIT PRODUCTION SCHEDULING
This case study presents a non-linear optimization application for open-pit production scheduling 
with cut-off grade optimization and stockpiling. An application of copper mine is selected for the 
production schedule. When mine has a stockpile, two key decisions need to be made: (a) how much 
materials and what quality should be sent to stockpile; and (b) how much materials and what quality 
should be sent from the stockpile to process plant.
The case study mine is located in Africa, and it has three distinct rock types: sulfide, oxide, and 
mixed. The resource model of the deposit was prepared by applying the ordinary kriging method and 
using 1-m composite data from exploration drilling (Chiles and Delfiner, 2012; Goovaerts, 1997). 
The 20 2 × ×0 10 metres blocks were selected for resource modelling. Each block has 10,800 tonnes 
of material available. A total number of 26,021 blocks are available within the resource model for 
mining optimization.
The production schedule with stockpiling and grade blending model maximizes the discounted 
cashflow over the mine life after satisfying slope, reserve, resource (mining, processing, and 
refining), and stockpile material handling constraints. However, the blending of materials in the 
stockpile makes the model non-linear (Bley et al., 2012). The formulation of the proposed mixed￾integer quadratic programming problem used the following indices, parameters, variables, objective 
function, and constraints.

The objective (Eq. 11.7) of this optimization problem is to maximize the discounted economic 
value (revenue minus cost) by minimizing the deviations (Eq. 11.8) from production targets over the 
mine life. The slope requirements for each mining block are respected by Eq. (11.9). The reserve 
constraints, i.e., a block can be mined once over the planning horizon, are respected by Eq. (11.10). 
The mining, processing, and refining capacity constraints are satisfied by Eqs. (11.11)–(11.13), 
respectively. Eqs. (11.14) and (11.15) calculate the quantity of ore and metal available at the stock￾pile; whereas, Eqs. (11.16) and (11.17) keep track of the supply of ore and metal from the stockpile 
to the processing destinations. The non-linear constraints (Eq. 11.18) are added in the optimization 
formulation to ensure constant ore to the metal ratio in stockpile over the mine life. This will ensure 
the consistent quality of blended materials sent from the stockpile to the process plant.
For solving the optimization, the algorithm proposed by Paithankar et al. (2020) is used in this 
case study. The solution strategy has three sequential steps: (a) a decision of extraction sequence is 
made; (b) a destination policy of the blocks is calculated, given the extraction decision as input; and 
finally (c) decision on the quantity of ore metal transport from the stockpile to plant is made, given 
the decisions from the first two steps as inputs. These three steps are integrated within a genetic 
algorithm (GA)-based optimization framework that maximizes the objective function iteratively, 
as discussed in Paithankar et al. (2020). Within the GA-based framework, the extraction sequence 
problem is solved using a maximum flow algorithm (Paithankar and Chatterjee, 2019; Chatterjee 
and Dimitrakopoulos, 2020). The economic value of block i is calculated using the below equation:
v S r g c m a i i i i = − ( ) − −  
 µ (11.19)
The construction of the graph for the maximum flow algorithm was decided based on the vi
. In the 
graph, all the mining blocks are considered nodes in the graph. In the graph, there are two additional 
nodes: source and sink, and are connected with the mining block nodes. If vi > 0, a connection is 
made using an arc from the source node, the block i, and the capacity of the arc is the value of eco￾nomic block value. On the other hand, if vi
< 0, a connection is made from block i to the sink with an 
arc capacity of the absolute value of the block economic value. Using a maximum flow algorithm, 
this graph can produce an ultimate pit limit. This graph can be extended to a multiple-period graph 
using the discounted price and using additional nodes and arcs (Chatterjee et al., 2016; Paithankar 
and Chatterjee, 2019; Paithankar et al., 2020, 2021). To generate a variable pit size, a weight wit ( )
was introduced in the graph, and these weights were optimized by GA (Paithankar and Chatterjee, 
2019) to generate an optimal extraction sequence ( ) xit = 1 that satisfies all physical and operational 
constraints.
After getting the extraction sequence ( ) xit = 1 , the grade and metal content of the material are 
used to decide destinations. A binary variable y , idt ∈{ } 0 1 is used for the destination based on the 
optimal value for the cut-off grade g
( ) dt , which is optimized within the same GA framework. In this 
case study, the destinations are considered: waste dump, stockpile, and processing stream. If the 
block i has the grade above the optimal cut-off grade g
( ) dt , the materials are sent to the processing 
stream. The materials are sent to the stockpile if the block grade is higher than the break-even 
cut-off grade but below the optimal cut-off grade. The remaining extracted blocks are sent to the 
waste dump.
The determine the quantity of ore to be sent from the stockpile to the processing plant for meeting 
the processing requirements, a linear decision variable zt ∈[ ] 0 1, is used. The quantity of ore from the 
stockpile to processing destination (qot
d ) is calculated by qo z o t
d
t t = ( ) ( −1) , where o(t −1) is the avail￾able ore quantity in the stockpile at the beginning of period t. Eq. (11.18) is then used to calculate 
the metal quantity sent to the process plant from the stockpile. It ensures that the non-linear mixing Non-linear algorithms for mining systems 381
381
constraints are satisfied. These parameters are simultaneously optimized using GA to maximize the 
objective function (Eq. 11.8), as discussed in Paithankar et al. (2020).
The economic parameters used for this study are presented in Table 11.3. For GA, a set of 
parameters need to be selected. The initial population, crossover probability, mutation probability, 
and parametric diversification probability are selected as 200, 0.8, 0.01, and 0.2. The selection 
strategy for the GA parameters is discussed in Paithankar and Chatterjee (2019). The number of 
production periods for this deposit is seven years, and the maximum mining capacity per period 
is 30 million tonne (MT). The plant’s processing capacity is between 4 MT to 5 MT; whereas, the 
refinery capacity is within 24,000 tonne to 26,000 tonne. The stockpile and waste dump capacities 
are considered unlimited.
The stochastic production scheduling with stockpiling and cut-off grade optimization was 
implemented in Matlab software. Since GA is a population-based optimization algorithm, the model 
was run five times, and average values were reported. Table 11.4 shows the solution of the non￾linear optimization. It is noted here that only upper bound constraint is used for mining capacity, 
and no deviation was allowed. It can be observed from the table that the material productions from 
all seven years are within the upper bound limit (30 MT). It was also observed that the material 
productions were low in the initial periods and increased in the later periods. The ore sent to plant 
in different production periods are very consistent and marginally deviates from the target limits. It

the over-production of metal generates a large amount of cashflow at the first period, which can 
compensate for the overproduction penalty. It can be seen from the table that at the beginning of the 
mine life, a small portion of the extracted ore is sent to stockpile, which is due to the destination of 
high-grade extracted ore to the process plant. It was also observed that the amount of ore sent from 
the stockpile to the process plant is consistently low over the mine life, except in Year 6 when 2.03 
MT of ore was sent from the stockpile to the process plant. From the optimal cut-off grade values, it 
can be seen the cut-off grade value is high at the initial period of the mine life and decreases at the 
later periods. It is quite expected as a higher cut-off grade ensures high-grade ores are sent to the 
process plant at the initial periods, and thus, produce more metal and cashflow. The total net present 
value generated from this project is 239.5 million US dollars (M$). To show the effectiveness of the 
applied non-linear optimization approach, the solution was solved without stockpile. In that case, no 
cut-off grade needs to optimize, and the basic maximum flow with GA proposed by Paithankar and 
Chatterjee (2019) was used for solving the problem. It was observed from the solution that the NPV 
from the project is 236.9 M$, which is 2.6 M$ less than the non-linear optimization model. These 
results demonstrated the effectiveness of the non-linear optimization for production scheduling of 
open-pit optimization.383
