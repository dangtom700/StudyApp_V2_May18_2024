Rare-earth elements are maybe the most exciting group in the periodic table featuring
a great diversity of properties. Unfortunately, these elements in many chemistry and
physics courses only play a minor role. Rarely, a concise overview is given enabling stu￾dents and researchers to quickly enter this field. Therefore, I intend with this textbook
to give an overview to provide the readers a basic understanding of the chemistry and
of the materials properties. All this is based on simple and as good examples as possible,
so this textbook will and cannot deliver a complete overview about rare-earth metal
based compounds and materials. It wants to deliver the ability to assess literature, to
provide the foot-in-the-door. Regarding the applications and examples, it is restricted to
the topics where rare-earth elements are crucial and on which their properties can be
demonstrated well. Further, colors were used, which should be appropriate for color￾blind readers.
Most of the more sophisticated chemical and physical basics are discussed, so with a
certain base on chemical and physical knowledge, you will be able to follow and under￾stand the topics herein. You are invited to actually work with this book. You may read
the book from page one until the (bitter) end; or you may pick out certain topics that you
either find in the Table of Contents or the Index, and then you may work through con￾sidering the cross references in the text. You may choose to follow the recommendations
for further reading given in the text.
This textbook is divided in two parts. In the first part, the basics of rare-earth chem￾istry, the basic data, the basic compound classes will be described and discussed. The
second part focuses on the optical and magnetic properties of the elements and espe￾cially their solid compounds. Both properties feature clear general trends, which can be
understood very well based on part one—understanding is in any case better than mem￾orizing detailed data. While in the case of the magnetic properties the general trends are
sufficient to understand the properties of most of the materials, the optical properties
are different; here, the general trends yield distinct individual properties. Accordingly,
in these chapters the individual ions are discussed. Eventually, I wish all readers to have
fun!

1.1 An Introduction
Let us start with a simple question, a question heavily debated in the 18th century:
What is a (rare-earth) element?
Element derives from the latin word elementum, which means something like a basic
unit. Boyle1
stated in his famous book, The Sceptical Chemist of 1661:
Those distinct substances, which concretes generally either afford, or are made up of, may, without
very much inconvenience, be called the elements or principles of them.
The great Lavoisier2
later defined an element as a matter, which cannot be decon￾structed by chemical means like heat, light, mechanical or electric energy. Further, as
we will see in chapter 4 on natural resources, most of the rare-earth elements are nei￾ther actually rare nor they are earths. Earths in this sense were considered elements
until the 19th century, before the English chemist, Davy,3
showed that via electroly￾sis, metals can be extracted from earths, nowadays known to be oxides as shown in
Figure 1.1. The very first publication on a rare earth, yttria, was published in 1794 by
Gadolin4
reporting its discovery [1]. The history following this first report is subject of
the second part of this Introduction.
Perhaps almost no one is aware that rare-earth elements are omnipresent in our
daily life. They play a crucial role for fighting global warming—from the very begin￾ning of energy generation based on solar or wind energy through lighting and electro￾mobility, heating and air-conditioning. They are present here as the converter of solar
radiation, as permanent magnets in wind turbines and electric engines, as energy saving
white light emitting diodes or as hydrogen storage material. There is a great diversity
of further applications reaching from catalysis, telecommunications and mobile phones
through medical applications. Accordingly, many of these elements are publicly consid￾ered as critical elements by the European Union and the United States [2, 3]. This may
be one reason, and a very good reason to study rare-earth chemistry and physics. An￾other reason may be to acquire the knowledge and know-how to become a researcher
in this field—and maybe it is altogether, and you intend to teach students. In any case,
our journey through the exciting world of rare-earth elements starts right now.

lanthanide elements. Also in this table, the actually accepted atomic masses are given
except that of promethium as this is a radioactive element. In Table 1.1, the relative
weight-% of the rare-earth oxides R2O3
contained in gadolinite and cerite from Bastnäs,
Sweden, and samarskite from Piława Górna, Poland are given; the contents of rare-earth
oxides vary even locally considerably. You may notice that generally the elements with
even numbers are more abundant than those with odd numbers. This will be addressed
in Chapter 4. With these sometimes very small figures in mind, the discovery history of
the rare-earth elements becomes even more impressive.
1.2 A Short History of Discovery
The part of Robert Boyle’s phrase on substances, which are made up of chemical el￾ements, is an especially important one during the discovery history of the rare-earth
elements. For a better overview, you may consult Figure 1.2. The story started in the
small Swedish town of Ytterby near Stockholm. There, Arrhenius5
found a black stone
in 1787, later named gadolinite. Chemically, this is a quite complicated composition
with R2
FeBe2O2
(SiO4
)

, where mainly the iron atoms cause the dark hue. Seven years
later, from this mineral Johan Gadolin extracted yttria and so discovered the first rare
earth [1]. This was a quite challenging task as the black stone is known to be a silicate,
and silicates are usually hard to digest and dissolve. Many years later, the rare-earth
metal yttrium was obtained from yttria. Also in Sweden, near the iron and copper

to be confused with the chemist and physicist, Svante Arrhenius.4 � 1 The Rare-Earth Elements
mine Bastnäs, on the edge of the 18th century, the discovery of another mineral was
reported—cerite with a typical composition of (R,Ca)9
(SiO4
)

(SiO3

(OH,F)3
. Its be￾havior was puzzling and it took decades before Martin Klaproth,6 Wilhelm Hisinger7
and Jöns Berzelius8
independently identified the earth ceria and the metal cerium in
1804 [8, 9]. Hisinger and Berzelius named the new element after the goddess Ceres of
agriculture who also was the namesake of the then, recently discovered, dwarf planet.
Another twenty years later, Mosander9
shed more light on the first two earths, yt￾tria and ceria. He succeeded in isolation of “cerium” metal by reducing its chloride
with the aid of gaseous potassium. Further experiments in this way obtained metal
samples that revealed different colors of obtained oxides upon oxidation and different
weights leading to the conclusion that further metals are hidden here. Careful experi￾ments then yielded a slightly more basic colorless oxide containing lanthanum in 1839,
named after the Greek term for hidden. Still, oxidation of different metal samples yielded
slightly different colors leading to the discovery of didymium, named after the Greek
word for “twin” [10]. In his publication, Mosander described the taste of lanthanum salts
as “sweet, slightly astringent.” Moreover, didymium oxide should be responsible for the
amethyst color hue of the other oxides and that these turn dark brown under red heat.
It would take another fifty years to elucidate that didymium comprises in total at least
five elements.
Mosander then also reinvestigated yttria and the ominous black stone mineral
gadolinite closer. After purifying the rare-earth oxide content, he could discriminate
three elements with decreasing solubility in aqueous oxalate solutions: first, erbium
oxalate precipitates, then terbium oxalate and finally the yttrium compound [10]. After
yttrium, also erbium and terbium were named after the location of the black stone,
Ytterby. So, until 1843, six rare-earth elements had been identified, some of which still
containing further elements as we know today.
To dig deeper in the group of rare-earth elements, new analytical tools were helpful
as until then only pure chemical methods were available: dissolution and precipitation
behavior, taste, heat treatment as well as color and crystal shape. By the end of the 1850s,
spectral analysis was developed. Moreover, the first ideas on the modern periodic table
were published by Mendeleev in 1869. Known elements were classified according their
atomic weight and many further elements were postulated. Certainly, gaps in the rows
of atomic masses suggested missing elements. In the following years, the so far known
rare-earth elements were scrutinized, their masses were determined more and more
precisely. To obtain cleaner samples, separation methods like the frequently repeated
recrystallization and fractional precipitation, were developed. Finally, the existence of

9 Carl Gustav Mosander, Swedish chemist and surgeon (*1797 †1858).1.2 A Short History of Discovery � 5
all elements discovered so far was confirmed, but some of the names became mixed
up and it is impossible to state today, who actually discovered terbium, for instance. In
Table 1.1, I therefore chose the first documented discoveries as long as the existence of
these elements was confirmed later.
A chemist participating in many of these controversies was Delafontaine.10 During
his investigations on samples from samarskite, i. e., ABO4
(A = R, U, Th, Sn, Fe, Ti; B =Nb,
Ta), he stated remarkable differences in the spectral properties of didymium with other
samples of didymiuim from cerite like the absence of certain spectral lines and differing
intensities. Lecoq de Boisbaudran11 repeated Delafontaine’s experiments and objected
to his findings that the didymium samples differed. Nevertheless, in the fraction contain￾ing also didymium he identified unknown spectroscopic lines and separated another el￾ement, which could be precipitated as oxalate or sulphate from this fraction. It is now
known as samarium. He chose the name after the aforementioned mineral samarskite.
Meanwhile, Marignac12 investigated the mineral gadolinite further, the black stone.
He stated that the earth erbia cannot be homogeneous as a colorless portion of the re￾spective chloride solution does not precipitate with sulfoxylic acid, H2
SO2
, while the
contained pink ions do. Accordingly, erbia could be separated into a colorless oxide—
for which no visible absorption could be found—and a pink oxide with the known ab￾sorption spectrum of erbium. Because of the similar chemical properties to yttrium and
erbium, Marignac named the new element ytterbium. This occurred in 1878.
1879 was an extraordinary year for rare-earth chemistry as the hitherto known er￾bium was proven to consist of four elements. The lucky guys conducting once again the
very careful separation chemistry were Cleve13 and Nilson.14 Nilson found in gadolin￾ite—the black stone—another new element. He finally separated a basic nitrate from
this mineral and named it scandium after his home region, Scandinavia. Scandium was
confirmed in the same year by Cleve—he isolated less than a gram of scandium oxide
from four kilograms of gadolinite. Cleve also again thoroughly investigated the erbium
oxide after removal of the ytterbium discovered the year before. Here, he separated
the erbium oxide fraction into three fractions—taken during the fractioning process.
Based on spectroscopy, he postulated two more elements. Scandinavia acted as name￾sake already, so he chose the ancient Greek name for the same region, Thule, and named
the first element thulium. For the second name, he took Sweden’s capital Stockholm,
and holmium was born. The discovery of holmium was also claimed by Swiss chemist,
Charles Soret, as element “X” from 1878. Cleve and Lecoq de Boisbaudran agreed that
holmium was indeed the same element, and accepted the priority for Soret. Seven years

13 Per Teodor Cleve, Swedish chemist (*1840 †1905).
14 Lars Fredrik Nilson, Swedish chemist (*1840 †1899).6 � 1 The Rare-Earth Elements
later, Lecoq de Boisbaudran was successful to prove after an even more elaborate sep￾aration process of more than 50 steps—comprising precipitations with ammonia and
oxalate—that the assumed element holmium actually contained a second element and
named it dysprosium after the Greek word for “inaccessible”. Although this may sound
like frustration, he eventually found a pure element.
By the end of 1879, eleven rare-earth elements were known, perhaps not yet pure.
In 1880, Marignac combined several separation methods developed before and applied
them to samarskite and found a colorless nitrate that behaved quite differently to the
others. It took another six years, now based on gadolinite samples, until its existence and
unequivocal discrimination from the other new elements was confirmed. It was named
gadolinium.
A new era in rare-earth chemistry started in 1885, when von Welsbach15 entered
the stage. Since the separation of samarium from didymium, doubts persisted that
didymium is indeed a pure element. Auer modified the separation processes of gadoli￾nite by giving the highly time-consuming fractional crystallization a higher priority. By
this approach, he was able to enrich certain fractions of didymium, and finally held
two different samples in his hands—different in color, greenish and pink. The element
behind the greenish oxide he named praseodidymium using the Greek word for “green,”
the element behind the pink one he named neodidymium, i. e., “new twin.” Later, how￾ever, the shortened names praseodymium and neodymium were assigned. Auer von
Welsbach noticed the luminescence of many rare-earth salts. He combined this find￾ing with the knowledge acquired in Bunsen’s laboratory during his studies there. He
invented the incandescent gas mantle where luminescence of rare-earth oxides is ex￾cited by a gas heat source. He set up a business, became rich and invented the brand
Osram. Most importantly, for rare-earth research, though, was the triggering of further
research driven by possible applications.
Still, there were debates whether samarium is already pure or whether there is an￾other hidden element. Demarçay16 conducted many careful separation experiments by
fractional crystallization of nitrates on samarium samples and, finally, in 1896 presented
another new nitrate. This was slightly less soluble in water than samarium nitrate, but
slightly better soluble than the gadolinium compound. Moreover, it showed different
spectra than the other two—and was named europium after Europe.
On the brink of the 20th century, Auer von Welsbach spent again more time for
rare-earth chemistry and checked the purity of ytterbium with further refined separa￾tion processes, now based on the fractional crystallization of rare-earth double oxalates
with ammonium. And indeed, there was indication for another element. In 1907, he sub￾mitted a manuscript reporting experimental evidence that ytterbium consisted of two

elements and suggested the nice names aldebaranium and cassiopeium. Forty days ear￾lier, Urbain17 had submitted a manuscript reporting the same, but suggesting the names
neoytterbium and lutetium, honoring his home city, Paris, with its latin name Lutetia.
Urbain had developed a novel separation process employing the auxiliary element bis￾muth. Bismuth behaves similar to rare-earth elements and for the crystallization of sev￾eral salts its solubility lies between those of two adjacent rare-earth elements. Therefore,
the separation of the rare-earth elements is enhanced. The dispute on the names contin￾ued for several years, and until World War II in German literature the name cassiopeium
instead of lutetium was frequently used.
The increasingly thorough understanding of the theory behind the chemical ele￾ments and the systematics of the periodic table driven by researchers like Nils Bohr
finally solved the important question whether further rare-earth elements exist some￾where in-between the ones known so far. The answer was yes, and it was solely ele￾ment no. 61, which was missing. First hints that between neodymium and samarium a
further element should exist were given in 1902 by Bohuslav Brauner18 who noted the
largest differences of properties along the whole rare-earth series between these two
elements. Eventually, it became clear that element 61 only exists in traces in nature as
there is no stable isotope for this element. Therefore, it is radioactive (Chapter 4). In 1947,
promethium was identified during investigations of fission products of uranium in the
course of the Manhattan Project [11]. The first two isotopes were 147
61Pm and 149
61Pm with
half-times of 3.7 years and 47 hrs, respectively. Presumably, because of its special back￾ground, it was named after Prometheus, a titan in Greek mythology, who stole the fire
from the Olympian gods to give it to mankind. Zeus was not happy about this incident
and punished Prometheus. The titan was tied to a rock, and every single day his liver
was eaten by Zeus’ eagle—since a new liver grew every night.
The first rare-earth element was discovered following the works in 1787, the last
identified in 1947. So, it took 160 years. You may read a more detailed history of all dis￾coveries with even more hot debates on the existence of certain elements, dead ends
and some more details on the chemical background of each controversy in [7]. The cited
chapter is one of meanwhile 329 chapters in 63 volumes of the Handbook on the Physics
and Chemistry of Rare Earths, initiated by Mr. Rare Earth, Karl Gschneidner.19 In this
book, I will occasionally reference to the chapters therein.
And now, it is time to look into the general aspects of rare-earth elements and under￾stand them from their atomic structure leading to physical and chemical properties of
the atoms and the rare-earth ions. This is crucial to understand, why certain ions form,
why the rare-earth elements behave physically and chemically as they do and why cer￾tain rare-earth elements are suited for optical and magnetic properties.

During data collection for this book, I came across a chemistry tutorial, which stated:
“The lanthanides and actinides possess more complicated chemistry that does not gen￾erally follow any trends. Therefore, noble gases, lanthanides and actinides do not have
electronegativity values” [12]. This is an interesting statement which, presumably, will
prove wrong in the next chapters.
2.1 The Rare-Earth Elements in the Periodic Table
Within the Periodic Table, the rare-earth elements have either a rather prominent or
easy-to-oversee position. Scandium, yttrium and lanthanum are sorted into group 3 as
they have in common the valence electron configuration ns
2
(n − 1)d1
. Moreover, the lan￾thanide elements are sometimes ignored in teaching as they are physically hidden on
some inflatable classroom periodic tables. Certainly, this somewhat hidden position is
due to the fact that according to Table 2.1 here the 4f states are subsequently filled and—
for reasons to be discussed later—the elements indeed belong also to group 3. Occa￾sionally, the old controverse discussion where to put the lanthanide elements properly
is warmed up [13, 14]. Some alternative representations of the Periodic Table, like the
one developed by Benfey,20 displayed in Figure 2.1, give the lanthanide elements the
prominent place they actually deserve, though. I like Benfey’s idea because it empha￾Figure 2.1: A modified representation of the Periodic Table, which was developed by Otto Theodor Benfey;

sizes the periodically evolving elements [15]. I made some changes especially to the bor￾ders between the rare-earth elements and the other transition metals as lanthanum and
lutetium indeed should share a single place in group 3.
Maybe the most important figure in chemistry is the electronegativity; it is crucial
for the basic understanding of the chemical bonding and physical properties of any
chemical moiety—like gases, liquids, solids or metals, insulators, semiconductors. Since
this central figure will also help us to understand a manifold of specific features found
for the lanthanide elements and their ions, a basic discussion will help the readership of
this textbook. Regardless of the differing physical definition, electronegativity depends
from the screening of the outermost electrons from the nuclear charge. The actually
relevant remaining nuclear charge after screening by core electrons is the effective nu￾clear charge targeting the electron under consideration. This screening determines its
ionization energy as well as the electron affinity for a further electron to be trapped by a
vacant state. An elaborate scrutiny of this concept with a focus up to the outer transition
metals may be found in [16]. In the following paragraph, I will employ this concept to
derive relevant properties of the rare-earth elements and their ions. For a better under￾standing of this discussion, you may imagine yourself standing somewhere in a valley,
i. e., the electron or vacant state under consideration. Your view will be constricted by
more or less transparent hills representing the shielding electron clouds as shown in
Figure 2.2. Depending on the problem, your view will be directed toward the nucleus
or outward seeking neighboring atoms. The more diffuse the hill becomes, the better
you will recognize your target of desire and its charge. In the first part, I will focus the
discussion on the view toward the nucleus.
Figure 2.2: Relative radial probability functions of 3s, 3d, 4f and 5p orbitals.
Simply spoken, the higher the effective nuclear charge affects an electron in an
atom, the larger its ionization energy will be. The ionization energy relates to a valence
electron, which is removed. Analogously, one can also consider an electronic vacancy
and estimate its attraction for trapping an additional electron present in the energetic
continuum. Hence, the electron affinity is released. Such vacancies are also called holes.
Electrons are situated within an atom as electron clouds or electron probability den￾sity in orbitals of different shape. Electron clouds concentrated closely around the nu￾cleus shield the nuclear charge better than diffuse electron clouds—recall the more or
less transparent hill image from above. For this estimation, the diffuseness of both, the
screening electron clouds and the screened electrons, have to be considered. The more
diffuse an orbital is the less efficient the screening effect of electrons therein will be.2.1 The Rare-Earth Elements in the Periodic Table � 13
Let us now illustrate what determines this diffuseness. First, it is governed by the
orbital type (azimuthal quantum number l), and, second, by the principle quantum num￾ber n. Each orbital features l angular nodes, i. e., planar nodes containing the nucleus.
The shielding efficiency declines with an increasing number of angular nodes as s or￾bitals have zero, p orbitals one, d orbitals two and f orbitals three of them. This is well
illustrated in Figure 2.2 since every angular node cuts two valleys in the shielding elec￾tron probability density and enables a better view through. Considering the same orbital
type, its shielding effect decreases with rising quantum number n as each additional
shell provides a further radial node.21 Thus, the electron clouds become more and more
diffuse as depicted in Figures 2.2 and 2.3.
Figure 2.3: The radial probability density of se￾lected s orbitals illustrating the increasing number
of radial nodes.
Accordingly, the diffuseness increases with the number of radial nodes. The 1s or￾bital being the very first occurring s orbital lacks any node while with each subsequent
shell an additional radial node emerges. Each shifts the orbital cloud outwards with the
relatively strongest effect upon introduction of the first radial node between 1s and 2s;
this is reflected in the strikingly different properties of the isoelectronic elements hy￾drogen (insulator) and lithium (metal). Insulators are characterized by well-localized
electron clouds while conduction requires diffuse orbitals with long-range interactions.
This basic finding holds for all orbital types, for 2p and 3p, for 3d and 4d, and of course
also for the 4f states, which are the first occurring f orbitals comprising no radial node
at all and, therefore, being relatively localized (nondiffuse).
Further, the screening of electrons by those comprising the same spin is worse com￾pared with those of opposite spin caused by the Pauli rule [17, Chapter 2.9]. For instance,
this explains why half and fully occupied degenerated orbitals are of particular stabil￾ity. First, such half-occupied orbitals like 4f7
feature a symmetric charge distribution.
Second, these electrons screen the eighth electron very well as its spin is opposite. And
finally, the seventh electron is shielded worse so its ionization energy is increased.
21 spherical nodes around the nucleus.14 � 2 Basic Aspects and General Properties
Employing this approach, the octet rule or the relatively low ligand-field splitting
of 3d orbitals with respect to 4d are concluded. 4d and 5d orbitals contain one and two
radial nodes, respectively. Thus, the 4d and even more the 5d states are significantly
more diffuse than the 3d ones. The interaction with approaching ligands will be stronger
with the more diffuse orbitals causing a larger ligand-field splitting (see also Chapter 8.5).
For this latter example, you will turn and look outwards recalling the hill image from
above.
Focusing on the lanthanide elements, we ought consider the 4f states first. These are
relatively contracted as they do not contain a radial node. Moreover, these elements pos￾sess filled 5s2
p
6
states (Figure 2.2) and in the case of the nonionized form 6 s2
shells (Fig￾ure 2.4). These aspects yield two main consequences. 4f states are badly screened against
the nuclear charge and they are well shielded by the 5s2
p
6
shell against any neighboring
atom—ligand or whatever. Since they experience a quite strong effective nuclear charge,
their ionization energies are high, and consequently the 4f states are only rarely ionized.
Viewing outwards, the excellent shielding against adjacent atoms prevents them from
strong interactions with these leading to a specific behavior regarding their optical and
magnetic properties; this will be discussed in Chapters 7.8 and 9.

Based on Allen’s22 approach of averaged valence electron energies, the electroneg￾ativities of the elements hydrogen through curium (Cm, no. 96) were calculated in a
slightly refined manner [18–20]. The advantage of this approach is that the majority
of the necessary data can actually be measured, so that the resulting electronegativity
scale is based on experimental data. This does not hold for the 4f and 5f elements where
calculations were still necessary; unfortunately, these calculations cannot be exact due
to spin-orbit coupling effects, which could not treated thoroughly. Thus, these values
show reliable qualitative trends only. In [20], a detailed discussion where to discrim￾inate between valence and core electrons is conducted; with regard to the lanthanide

elements, valence electrons are considered to be found in the outermost 6s, 5d and 4f
orbitals. The obtained average valence electron energies are listed in Table 2.1, together
with the scaled values to become comparable to Pauling’s23 scale, which will be used for
the discussion, and they show a clear trend. From scandium to promethium, the elec￾tronegativities range between 1.0 and 1.2, but rise strongly toward gadolinium, where
a maximum of 2.3 is achieved. Then, between terbium and erbium, again more or less
the same values between 1.3 and 1.4 are found before the electronegativities steeply rise
toward 1.7 for ytterbium; lutetium then again plays in the league of the first half. A fur￾ther discussion follows in Chapter 3.5 where the electronegativities are also depicted in
Figure 3.7.

A further famous consequence of the screening model is based on the scenario that
the nuclear charge increases by fourteen units between lanthanum and lutetium while
the fourteen respective electrons populate rather badly screening 4f orbitals (Figure 2.2).
Obviously, this causes a contraction of the next shells’ orbitals, and thus the whole atoms,
23 Linus Pauling, American chemist, Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1954 and Nobel Peace Prize 1962 (*1901
†1994).16 � 2 Basic Aspects and General Properties
respectively. This consequence is commonly known as lanthanide contraction and is ac￾cordingly responsible for the increasing densities observed from scandium via yttrium
to lanthanum and lutetium (Chapter 3).
2.2 Electronic Configuration
The electronic configurations of the rare-earth elements and their most relevant ions
are depicted in Table 2.1. The latter ones are those present in nature and in relevant
materials. Here, I add a special remark on promethium for which nature did not find a
physically stable combination of protons and neutrons; it therefore only forms radioac￾tive isotopes—nonetheless, it is also present in the table as it is occurring naturally in
traces (Chapter 4). The gaseous lanthanide element atoms adopt the general configura￾tion [Xe]4fn − 1
5d1
6s2
starting from cerium (n = 1).
The configurations given for the gaseous atoms suggest a possibly stable diva￾lent oxidation state for most of the lanthanide elements according to a configuration
[Xe]4fn − 1
5d1
after the ionization of the 6s electrons. But certainly the diffuseness of the
5d states and their accordingly very broad bands in the metals’ band structure, well
overlaying the narrow 4f bands, should be considered. Then it is obvious that the third
electron exhibits most likely 5d character in the solid, which determines the chemical
properties. Hence, this third electron is also quite easily ionized leading to the most sta￾ble oxidation state R3+. Dorenbos analyzed the lanthanide states’ energies with regard
to different oxidation states and his findings confirm these arguments [21].3 General Trends of Physical and Chemical Behavior
In this chapter, I will discuss basic general trends within the series of rare-earth ele￾ments. Several properties develop rather continuously with distinct exceptions. After
starting with basic data such as the atomic radii, ionic radii and the densities, we will
shed light on melting and boiling points as well as the structure chemistry of the ele￾ments. Here, a short story is included on cerium as an example for the complexity of the
pure elements, which cannot be thoroughly discussed in this book. Then we will slowly
turn to more chemistry related properties like electronegativities and chemical hard￾ness before looking at the chemistry in solution and oxidation states. A discussion on
simple complexes will complete this chapter.
3.1 Atomic, Ionic and van der Waals Radii
Figure 3.1 shows the evolving van der Waals and atomic radii as well as the ionic radii
of eightfold coordinated trivalent rare-earth ions. Certainly, scandium and yttrium com￾prise fewer electronic shells and, therefore, cause an almost linear increase for all pre￾sented radii. Apart from that, the atomic radii decrease smoothly with an increasing
nuclear charge, and due to the quite ineffective shielding of the consecutively added 4f
electrons. For europium and ytterbium two maxima are obvious. In these cases semi and
fully occupied 4f configurations shield especially the outermost 6s electrons somewhat
better than the others due to the symmetric charge distribution. The improved shielding
yields a relative expansion of both outer shells, and thus larger atomic radii.
Figure 3.1: Van der Waals (black), atomic (orange)
and ionic radii (blue) of the rare-earth atoms, the
ionic radii represent those of eightfold coordinated
trivalent ions.
In the case of the ionic radii of the trivalent ions, a smoothly decreasing trend is
observed well in accordance with the above mentioned increase of the nuclear charge.
Since the 6s states are empty here, the differing shielding of the 4f states has no impact.
From a chemical point of view, it should be noted that trivalent yttrium ions are approx￾https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110680829-00318 � 3 General Trends of Physical and Chemical Behavior
imately as large as holmium and erbium, and accordingly behave similarly like these re￾garding structures and chemistry. Interestingly, a similar trend is observed for the van
der Waals radii, which have been determined by interatomic distances of compounds
disregarding oxidation states and coordination numbers [22]. In the case of rare-earth
elements, predominantly trivalent ions R3+ are present and these accordingly dominate
the data analysis leading to the plotted behavior. You may find an overview on the ionic
radii of R3+, but also on the less often found R2+ and R4+, in Appendix A.
3.2 Densities, Melting and Boiling Points
The densities of the rare-earth elements evolve similarly like the melting and boiling
points, plotted together in Figure 3.2. As one may expect from the atomic radii, minima
of the densities are achieved where atomic radii are maximal, i. e., the case for europium
and ytterbium. The increase of densities from lanthanum to lutetium is mainly due to
the lanthanide contraction as discussed in Chapter 2.1.
Figure 3.2: Melting points (black), boiling points
(orange) and densities (blue) of the rare-earth
atoms.
The melting points should be roughly a function of the bond strength within the el￾ement. According to Figure 3.2, the melting points smoothly increase with atomic mass
and decreasing atomic radii within the row of lanthanide elements. Scandium and yt￾trium lack 4f electrons, and apparently feature a stronger interatomic bonding leading
to similar melting points like lutetium, which in turn has a filled 4f shell and profits
from the full lanthanide contraction. For europium and ytterbium, two minima are ob￾vious in agreement with their larger atomic radii—due to a semi and a fully occupied 4f
shell—and lower densities leading to slightly weaker interatomic interactions, and thus
lower melting points. A more or less similar trend is found for the boiling points of the
elements.3.3 Crystal Structures of the Elements � 19
3.3 Crystal Structures of the Elements
The great advantage of crystal structures of metals throughout the Periodic Table is their
simplicity as they derive from simple close packings of spherical atoms with only a few
exceptions. In close packed layers—similar to oranges packed in a box—each atom is
surrounded by six others leading to a hexagonal pattern. Adjacent close packed layers
B follow in a way that its atoms reside above the voids of the first layer A. If the atoms
of the adjacent layers show an eclipsed arrangement—layer sequence BAB—layer A is
considered hexagonal (h). If they show a staggered arrangement according to a layer se￾quence BAC, layer A is considered cubic (c). Thus, two main typical metal structures are
obtained: the cubic close packing only containing c layers comprising a layer sequence
of …ABC… (c) and the hexagonal close packing exclusively containing h layers with a
general layer sequence of …AB… (h). Moreover, primitively packed tetragonal layers are
known yielding the slightly less close packed body-centered cubic arrangement of atoms
(bcc).
The rare-earth metals show an easy solubility of hydrogen of up to approximately
21 at-%, which will be the subject of Chapter 6.1 on hydrides; this fact led to slightly dif￾fering structure determinations in early studies on the crystal structures of the elements
as hydrogen had been overseen occasionally [27, 28]. This is a very important point that
researchers on rare-earth elements should have in mind during syntheses, and espe￾cially during physical property measurements. Traces of hydrogen contaminations may
yield astonishingly sensational results of the “elements” or their compounds.
Around room temperature the second half of the elements starting from gadolinium
adopts a simple hexagonal close packing shown as structure c in Figure 3.3; the only ex￾ception here is ytterbium comprising a cubic close arrangement of atoms, depicted as b.
In the first-half, different stacking orders of close packed layers are found: lanthanum,
praseodymium, neodymium and promethium show a layer sequence …ABAC… (hc), a
so-called double hexagonal close packing displayed as structure a in Figure 3.3. Topolog￾ically, closely related to this arrangement is the unique crystal structure of samarium,
in which the layer sequence …ABABCBCAC… (hhc) is found, yielding the rhombohedral
structure d. Finally, for cerium a cubic close packing (structure b) and for europium
the only rare-earth element adopting a body centered cubic structure was reported at
room temperature (structure e) [30]. The d shell elements scandium and yttrium adopt
a simple hexagonal close packing h alike gadolinium.
In some cases, there are also low-, and in many cases, high-temperature phases as
depicted in Figure 3.4. The transitions of terbium and dysprosium to orthorhombically
distorted structures at low temperatures coincide with ferromagnetic ordering at the
same temperatures; so these phase transitions are apparently magnetically driven ones
as roughly discussed in Chapter 9.4. Cerium shows a transition from a cubic close pack￾ing c around −150 °C to the double hexagonal close packing hc and back around 50 °C;
above 725 °C, a further transition to the body centered cubic packing (bcc) occurs. Since
this latter packing features a lower density than close packings, it seems reasonable that20 � 3 General Trends of Physical and Chemical Behavior

top; data: [23–26].

most of the rare-earth elements adopt this structure type just below the respective melt￾ing point. Within the lanthanides, europium shows the lowest density, and throughout
the temperature range, only the bcc type structure. The behavior of cerium is somewhat
puzzling and behind these simple data more exciting details are hidden. Therefore, the
properties of cerium metal will be subject of a short story in the following section. Here,
I omit the also reported high-pressure phases in detail as these are beyond the scope of
this book.
Watching out for a general trend between lanthanum and lutetium, we omit eu￾ropium and ytterbium who always behave differently. As can be seen from Figure 3.4,
the structures follow roughly a trend from c structures via hc and hhc (Sm-type) to h,
apparently an increasing contribution of h layers. This apparent behavior is of inter￾est because it helps to understand why these different crystal structures are realized.
As mentioned earlier, an increasing nuclear charge leads to a contraction of the or-3.4 On Cerium—a Short Story � 21
bitals (Chapter 2.1). Accordingly, with growing nuclear charge the 4f states contract rela￾tively stronger with respect to the 5d and 6s states. Calculations of the band-structure of
gadolinium confirm an expected dominating role of broad 5d and 6s bands around the
Fermi level, where the structural music plays; but these 5d states are apparently strongly
influenced by the local 4f states [33]. This influence coincides with the energetic overlap
between the exchanging states, and thus a roughly decreasing influence of 4f is to be
expected going from left to right in the lanthanide series.
As mentioned above, looking at the crystal structures from left to right a relatively
increasing contribution of h layers is observed. In the case of lanthanum, cerium and
ytterbium the same can be deduced from the structures with decreasing temperature.
Beyond the cubic close packing structures, the body-centered cubic ones are detected,
apparently yielding an even lower exchange with 4f states as therein slightly larger
interatomic distances are realized. Considering europium, only showing the body￾centered cubic structure, this meets with the lowest density (Figure 3.2); moreover,
calculations show a formal oxidation state transition within europium metal from a
divalent (Eu2+
⋅ 2 e) to a trivalent one (Eu3+
⋅ 3 e) with increasing pressure—so, at high
pressures a behavior comparable to the other rare-earth metals adopting even a hexag￾onal close packing can be expected, which is indeed the case [34, 25]. The phrasing
Eu2+
⋅ 2 e might be new for many readers, so I add a few words here. In lithium metal,
atomic cores Li+
comprising a noble gas configuration host highly mobile itinerant
electrons. Hence, lithium metal could also be described as Li+
⋅ e. As the 4f orbitals are
screened very well against neighboring atoms, they also form distinct bands with weak
interactions with other valence orbitals like 5d or 6s within the metal. Therefore, the 4f
configuration contributes rather to the core of the rare-earth atoms than to the itinerant
electrons. Thus, in rare-earth elements the 4f configuration determines the number of
itinerant electrons alike in Eu2+
⋅ 2 e with a core configuration [Xe]4f7
and Eu3+
⋅ 3 e with
a configuration of the core of [Xe]4f6
. We will see the consequences of such different
core configurations in the following section.
3.4 On Cerium—a Short Story
It is impossible to portray all the interesting phases and fascinating properties com￾ing along for the rare-earth elements in a single textbook. In this chapter, I will de￾scribe some of the features of cerium metal and you may then infer the diversity found
throughout the other elements. Cerium is at least one of the most versatile metals of
the Periodic Table if not the most versatile one. On a first glance, the schematic phase
diagram depicted in Figure 3.5 looks quite simple but the story behind is puzzling and
exciting at the same time. It certainly also illustrates some very basic characteristics of
the behavior of rare-earth elements.
The shown phase diagram comprises seven solid phases and—this is unique among
metals—a critical point within the solid regime! Further data on these phases are listed22 � 3 General Trends of Physical and Chemical Behavior

in Table 3.1. Generally, it is often challenging to synthesize the pure phases because of
strong hysteresis effects with delayed phase transitions. This holds especially for the
martensitic transitions,24 such as that of the γ into the β-phase, where layers of the
structure are sheared with respect to the adjacent ones. Thus, tensions in the material
are induced inhibiting further transition. Hence, it took several decades to achieve the
knowledge we have today about cerium’s phase diagram—and there is still discussion
on some points like the dotted lines in Figure 3.5.

Following the vertical red arrow with increasing temperature at ambient pressure
first the α-, then the β-, the γ- and finally above 1000 K the δ-phase (bcc) with the lowest
density of all phases are observed (Table 3.1). The body-centered cubic structure (bcc) is
a comparably open structure with relatively large voids, and thus a lower volume effi￾ciency compared with close packed ones as an increasing temperature fosters the aver￾age atomic movement. They occur frequently as high temperature phases of outer tran￾sition metals. With growing occupation of d states, the bcc packing becomes increasingly
stable and is hence also found as high temperature phases from lanthanum through dys￾prosium, ytterbium, scandium and ytterbium.
The observations along the yellow arrow in Figure 3.5 are puzzling on the first
glance as the structure remains a cubic close packing (c) and only the density declines
until the turning point around 600 K. At the critical point, both α- and γ-phase are in￾distinguishable. But then within the γ-phase regime, the density declines significantly
less and the density difference relative to the α-phase grows to approximately one-fifth
approaching room temperature. Thus, the α- and γ-phase adopt the same structure but
exhibit strikingly different densities. Calculations show that the energies of relatively
localized 4f and delocalized 5d states are rather similar. Consequently, small shifts of rel￾ative stabilities lead to dramatically different electronic properties. For instance, upon
pressure a contraction of a compound is promoted and indeed the density increases
from the γ- to α-phase. Such a contraction easily occurs if the single f electron of the
more or less 4f1
system in the γ-phase moves into the 5d states and becomes delocal￾ized. The same effect occurs upon heating of the γ-phase when the f electron density is
smoothly excited thermally into the 5d band from room temperature (4f0.94) toward the
critical point where 4f0.74 is achieved. Picking up the discussion at the end of the last
section, this could also be formulated as Ce3.26+
⋅ 3.26e –
.
On the other side, the α-phase starts from 4f0.33 at low temperature and smoothly
approaches the same value like the γ-phase with increasing temperature. Here, the ther￾mal expansion apparently stabilizes the 4f states with respect to the 5d band. Neverthe￾less, this specific γ- to α-phase transition is still the subject of intense debates regarding24 � 3 General Trends of Physical and Chemical Behavior
the physical basics and reasons behind this behavior as some experimental results con￾tradict this explanation [37, 41].
On cerium, a Kondo effect25 behavior was reported. This effect describes the scat￾tering of itinerant electrons in a metal by localized magnetic impurities. This may also
be understood as a partial hybridization of the localized 4f states with itinerant elec￾trons. Then with decreasing temperature an anomalous increase of the resistivity is
observed, which collapses upon magnetic ordering. The magnetic impurities here are
cerium atoms with localized f electrons. This Kondo behavior is one of the alternative
explanations for the strange γ- to α-phase transition.
Interestingly, the β-phase shows two antiferromagnetic ordering temperatures at
12.5 and 13.7 K. This can be understood by the crystal structure of the hhc packing where
cerium atoms in the h layers order earlier than those of the c layer. Below the Néel tem￾perature, TN = 14.4 K, the γ-phase orders antiferromagnetically. The on first glance small
difference in the layer sequence yields a different magnetic ordering behavior. Accord￾ing to the phase diagram shown in Figure 3.5, at this temperature, the α-phase is the
thermodynamically stable phase. But both the γ- as well as the β-phase, are metastable
since the transition to the α-phase is impeded by tensions in the metal due to the volume
contraction of more than 15 %.
At pressures between 2 and 4 GPa, even superconductivity with Tc ≈ 2 K was ob￾served. According to Figure 3.5, either the α
′
- or the α
′′-phase should be responsible for
this effect. Careful experiments and calculations suggest that indeed the orthorhombic
α
′
-phase is the phase of choice as only here a sufficiently strong electron-phonon cou￾pling was identified [42]. In this context, it is worth to mention that superconductivity up
to a considerable Tc ≈ 115 K was predicted and experimentally confirmed for a so-called
cerium superhydride, i. e., CeH10, at a pressure of 95 GPa—but this is another story [43].
So, in my opinion, cerium is indeed an exciting metal, which nicely demonstrates that
behind simple data there can be an intricate network of phase relationships and their
properties puzzling physicists to date.
3.5 Ionization Behavior and Chemical Hardness
In Figure 3.7, the ionization energies of the rare-earth elements are displayed. The com￾plete table of data may be consulted in Appendix B. Also, in this diagram, we find the
expected trends similar to those discussed in the previous chapters. Almost constant
figures for the first and second ionization energies, which remove both electrons from
the outermost ns shell, are obvious. The third electron, predominantly present in the
(n − 1)d states, is subject to a different shielding by core electrons. While 3d orbitals—
not comprising any radial node—face a quite strong effective nuclear charge, 4d and 5d

orbitals—comprising one and two radial nodes—are better shielded. Accordingly, the
ionization energies decrease along the row scandium, yttrium and lanthanum. Within
the lanthanide series, the shielding declines with increasing number of 4f electrons crest
two maxima for Eu2+ and Yb2+ where semifilled and fully occupied 4f states are achieved
(Table 2.1). The same reason is responsible for the relatively low third ionization ener￾gies found for gadolinium and lutetium, respectively. In the case of the fourth ionization
energy, the relatively higher stability of empty (Ce4+) and semifilled 4f states (Tb4+) is re￾flected in the found minima.
To estimate, understand and explain chemical behavior, the concept of hard and soft
acids and bases (HSAB concept) has been proven helpful in many cases. The chemical
hardness may be understood as the charge density of a chemical moiety and it increases
with charge and decreasing size. It essentially uses the moiety’s polarizability to estimate
whether two particles behave similarly, and if these prefer either covalent or electro￾static interactions. If they feature a high polarizability they are soft, and they are hard
if the polarizability is low. Pearson26 proposed that the chemical or absolute hardness η
can be quantified by the HOMO-LUMO gap27 according to
η =
I − A
2
(3.1)
using the ionization energy I and electron affinity A. In the case of monoatomic trivalent
ions of the rare-earth series, the fourth and third ionization energies may be used in
good approximation for I and A, respectively [44, 45]. The more diffuse an orbital is the
larger the difference between ionization energy (I) and electron affinity (A) would be
for the same electron

Considering the Ln3+ ions, this difference can be neglected in good approximation. Em￾ploying this approach, the hardness values displayed in Figure 3.7 (right, blue squares)
and listed in Appendix B were calculated. Considering the increasing ionic radius from
scandium via yttrium to lanthanum, a decreasing hardness is reasonable. Within the
Ln3+ series, almost constant figures indicate very similar behavior, only Gd3+ and Lu3+
are slightly harder, presumably due to the symmetric charge distribution typical for
semi and fully filled orbitals. Such minor gradual differences make a separation of a
mixture of such ions very difficult and, therefore, sophisticated techniques had to be
developed to get the pure elements from natural ores, which will be discussed in Chap￾ter 5. It also confirms the great challenges the discoverer of rare-earth elements were
facing (Chapter 1.2).
Chemical bonding properties may be estimated in a straightforward way by looking
at the electronegativities of the involved elements (Figure 3.7). Unfortunately, neither
Pauling nor Allen provided them for the complete series of rare-earth elements, and
thus only estimated values were listed in textbooks [46, 19]. Here, I shall use the recently
published values listed in Table 2.1 [20]. Since electronegativity can be directly connected
to the ionization energies of the considered chemical species as done by Allen, it is not
further surprising that the shape of the evolving orange curve in Figure 3.7 resembles
features of the ionization energies’ development.
On average, the electronegativities of the rare-earth elements are lower than those
of the outer transition metals, the d-block elements. The 4f states are localized signif￾icantly closer to the nuclei, and accordingly show higher electron binding energies
yielding higher electronegativities for the lanthanide elements compared to the re￾maining rare-earth elements without 4f valence electrons. Among scandium, yttrium,
lanthanum and lutetium, scandium has the highest electronegativity as there 3d states
contribute, lacking radial nodes. The lanthanide series can then be halved; between
cerium and gadolinium as well as from terbium to ytterbium the electronegativities
increase smoothly. The elements of the second half are somewhat more electronegative
due to the higher nuclear charges and smaller radii. Gadolinium shows an exceptionally
high electronegativity due to its highly symmetric charge distribution with a half-filled,
and thus contracted 4f shell yielding relatively high electronic binding energies. This
holds also for ytterbium with its fully occupied 4f shell. Apart from that, the elements
frequently adopting the divalent state, i. e., samarium, europium, thulium and ytter￾bium are comparable to the platinum elements regarding their electronegativities.
3.6 Oxidation States—Colors in an Aqueous Solution
According to the previously scrutinized screening behavior of core electrons, one ex￾pects that the outermost two 6s electrons will be ionized quite easily. Moreover, this also3.6 Oxidation States—Colors in an Aqueous Solution � 27
holds for the third one, normally localized in the relatively diffuse 5d states. Thus, the
trivalent state is the most common oxidation state of all rare-earth elements.
Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions from the trivalent state in the cases where
half or fully occupied 4f states are present. These are of specific stability due to the highly
symmetric charge distribution even better shielding the next electron. In the case of a
half-filled shell, this next electron features opposite spin and is screened even better. Ac￾cordingly, Eu2+ and Tb4+ may be obtained under suited conditions. A similar situation is
found for trivalent cerium where only the last remaining 4f electron has to be ionized to
achieve the xenon noble gas configuration; further, ytterbium can achieve a fully occu￾pied 4f shell in its divalent state. Thus, Yb2+ and Ce4+ are also quite stable. Additionally,
the nuclear charge is lower and the screening thereof is better in the case of Ce3+ com￾pared with praseodymium and terbium, so the fourth ionization energy is higher in the
latter cases. The general trend, that 4f electrons are rarely ionized, is contrary to the
early actinoids where the 5f states are rather easily further ionized due to the presence
of the first radial node causing a clearly higher diffuseness as discussed in Chapter 2.1.
The relative stability of different oxidation states in aqueous media is reflected in the
reduction potentials of the respective elements. Figure 3.8 displays the Frost diagram28
of the rare-earth elements including the alkaline-earth metal calcium for comparison.
All reduction potentials are listed in Table 3.3.
Figure 3.8: The Frost diagram28 of the rare-earth
elements and calcium; the pure elements are at 0 V.
As discussed thoroughly in Chapter 8, most of the optical transitions occur between
4f terms and are accordingly more or less forbidden. Consequently, the colors of such
ions in a solution given in Table 3.2 remain pale. Only a few ions show intense colors
due to 5d-4f transitions like the Ln2+ or due to charge-transfer transitions like Ce4+
.
For the trivalent ions of holmium and neodymium, more than one color is given,
which depends from the illumination source as discussed in Chapter 8.4.6 and some￾times from the chemical surrounding. Occasionally, Eu3+ already under daylight shows
red emission, which mixes with the otherwise colorless impression to a pinkish hue.

3.7 General Reactivity
The chemical behavior of the most reactive rare-earth element europium is akin to
that of the alkaline-earth metals calcium, strontium and barium. This holds already for
the stability of the hydrides. The rare-earth elements react readily with hydrogen to
form hydrides, slowly at room temperature, readily above 400 °C (see also Chapter 6.1).
These are among the most stable hydrides of all transition metals. For the careful inves￾tigation of metals’ properties it is therefore essential to exclude hydrogen contamina￾tions. The general reactivity declines roughly in the row europium, cerium, lanthanum,
neodymium, praseodymium and then samarium through lutetium. In this section, the
reactivity against the halogenes, oxygen and air is described; for the reactivity against
other elements and for the formation of alloys, [47] is suggested.
Also, against halogenes the reactivity of the rare-earth elements is only somewhat
lower compared with the alkaline-earth elements by reacting smoothly at room temper￾ature but vigorously with increasing temperature. The most stable binary compounds
among the halides are the trifluorides. Especially calcium is clearly more attractive for
fluoride, which is nicely reflected in the fact that the remarkably stable fluorite, CaF2
,
forms upon reaction of rare-earth fluorides with calcium metal. This provides an easy
metallothermic process to obtain rare-earth metals; only samarium, europium and yt￾terbium cannot be achieved this way as these are too volatile to separate surplus calcium
by distillation under vacuum. The fluorides are so stable due to their higher chemical
hardness compared with oxide that the fluorides may be even obtained from the rare￾earth oxides by reacting these with hydrogen fluoride above 600 °C. Moreover, the flu-3.8 Solution Chemistry � 29
orides show a limited solubility in aqueous solutions for the same reason. More details
like the synthesis of the pure binary halides will be a topic of Chapter 6.2.
The high stability of the sesquioxides R2O3
, the rare earths, reflects the high affinity
of rare-earth elements against air. Figure 1.1 displays photographs of common rare-earth
oxides. Especially in humid air, the most reactive rare-earth element europium quickly
develops a film on its surface consisting of yellow Eu(OH)2
⋅H2O. Besides the special role
of europium, the reactivity against air generally increases with humidity, temperature
and the lighter the rare-earth element is. Ytterbium and yttrium can be handled in dry
air without significant oxidation, for instance. Further details on oxides can be found in
Chapter 6.3. The reactivity regarding humidity increases further with pure water, min￾eral acids and bases. The formed compounds on the surface flake-off and allow for fur￾ther oxidation.
3.8 Solution Chemistry
3.8.1 Reduction Potentials
The reduction potentials of the rare-earth elements are listed in Table 3.3. If a poten￾tial is negative, the left side of the reaction is more stable and vice versa. And certainly,
the more negative, the more stable the left side is. On a first glance, it is obvious that
the trivalent state is the most stable throughout the whole series. For some not even a
second reduction potential has been reported. Certainly, the noble gas configuration of
xenon, realized in La3+ and Ce4+, is of specific stability. The same holds for a half-filled
4f7
shell, realized for Eu2+, Gd3+ and Tb4+, and a fully occupied 4f14 configuration like
in Yb2+ and Lu3+. With increasing distance from these specifically stable configurations,
the respective ions become less stable. Considering the divalent ions, this trend can be
followed by decreasing reduction potentials along the series Eu2+, Yb2+, Sm2+ and Tm2+
,
followed by Pm2+, Nd2+ and Pr2+. Thus, the most stable divalent ions are those of eu￾ropium, ytterbium, samarium and thulium. To assess whether these ions were stable in
degassed aqueous solutions, the potentials

stable in humid air.30 � 3 General Trends of Physical and Chemical Behavior

suggest an instability of tetravalent cerium because of the larger reduction potential
even in an acidic solution. But luckily, a high kinetic overpotential of oxygen prevents
direct reduction of Ce4+ and development of oxygen. Therefore, the cerimetry can be
conducted under ambient atmosphere; because of at least partial precipitation of hy￾droxides, or the dioxide, an acidic solution is compulsory. Cerimetry is an analytical
method, a type of redox titration, where a sulfuric, deep orange solution of Ce4+ upon3.8 Solution Chemistry � 31
reduction to Ce3+ turns colorless. Generally, it can be employed instead of all quantita￾tive determinations where manganometry is used since the volumetric cerium solution
is clearly more stable. In many cases, the color change may be hard to see, and then a
respective redox indicator like ferroin is recommended.
3.8.2 Acid-Base Chemistry and Simple Complexes
According the discussion in Chapter 3.5, all trivalent rare-earth ions R3+ are hard acids.
Their hardness increases along the whole series with decreasing ionic radius. The hard￾ness is emphasized by the closed 5s2
p
6
shell because the potentially more polarizable 4f
states are invisible to any solvent as they are hidden behind that shell (see Figure 2.4).
With the declining size of the ions, also the basicity decreases from La(OH)3
through
Lu(OH)3
. Comparing Lu3+ and Sc3+ with Al3+, the ionic radii decrease for a common oc￾tahedral surrounding from 100 via 89 to 68 pm [50]. While Al(OH)3
is a prime example
for amphoterism, this behavior is unknown in rare-earth solution chemistry. But in the
solid state quite recently hexahydroxides Sr3
[R(OH)6
]
2 were characterized for the small￾est ions starting from Sc3+ and continuing with yttrium, holmium through lutetium.
These compounds were synthesized in an extremely basic hydroflux [51]. Up to then,
only a few solid alkaline scandates like K[ScO2
] or Cs[ScO2
] had been described. Here,
octahedral ScO6 moieties were reported quite some time ago [52]. This underlines the by
far less tendency of amphoterism for any rare-earth ion compared with Al3+. Trivalent
scandium can also be found in a tetrahedral surrounding like in the quite particular
suboxoscandate Cs9
(ScO4
) which looks metallic golden [53]. This is presumably due to
the presence of itinerant electrons according to (Cs+

.
Thus, the tendency to form covalent bonds to ligands, such as water molecules, is
low. Hence, the interactions are electrostatic, allowing for a broad range of coordination
numbers. This certainly also holds for the solid state, but also in a solution, systematic
variations were detected. Below a pH of approximately 5, the rare-earth elements form
pure aqua complexes and above the bound water molecules are increasingly depro￾tonated [49]. The coordination number should increase with growing size of the cation,
and this is indeed the case. Considering the aqua complexes, experiments and molecular
dynamic calculations confirm that the average coordination number changes from nine
to eight along the series La3+ through Lu3+ as schematically depicted in Figure 3.9. The
larger ions prefer a ninefold coordination [R(H2O)9
]
3+ with the water molecules most
probably forming a tricapped trigonal prismatic coordination polyhedron. The smallest
ions prefer an eightfold coordination [R(H2O)8
]
3+ with a square antiprismatic surround￾ing. However, between both a broad transition regime was ascertained where predom￾inantly a fluctuating surrounding between bi and tricapped trigonal prismatic coordi￾nation was found. A central finding is that the exchange frequency is dominant in this
region where the third capping water molecule hops on and off the trigonal prism as is32 � 3 General Trends of Physical and Chemical Behavior
Figure 3.9: Schematic development of the average coordination number in aqueous solution, the evolve￾ment of the ligand exchange frequency and the determined coordination polyhedra according to [54, 55].
obvious from Figure 3.9. This exchange frequency reaches its maximum for different sol￾vents between gadolinium and holmium. Thus, here the greatest dynamic and according
reactivity is expected. As soon as the square antiprismatic surrounding is achieved, the
ninth solvent molecule does not find its place that easy anymore. Although there is only
a minor difference between the square antiprismatic and bicapped trigonal prism, the
somewhat larger vacant coordination site in the latter matters.
Historically, and for a broader comprehensive understanding of the complex chem￾istry of the rare-earth elements, the nitrato complexes are of great relevance. These
demonstrate the relevance of available space and the dominance of electrostatic in￾teractions. Moreover, they laid the foundation for the development of the separation
chemistry of rare-earth elements, and they were employed in the course of fractional
crystallization of double salts with magnesium, ammonium or alkaline metals. As pre￾viously stated, in an aqueous solution there is almost no chemical difference between
La3+ and Lu3+. But by complexation, chemically more diverse moieties with different sol￾ubilities and so forth are obtained—and that is what separation chemistry is all about
as you will read in Chapter 5. Therefore, the nitrato complexes were among the first
thoroughly characterized ones.
For the largest trivalent rare-earth ions, a twelvefold coordination building an icosa￾hedron is found where each nitrato group acts as a bidentate ligand. Hence, the cerium
atom is coordinated by six nitrato groups, which are arranged octahedrally as depicted
in Figure 3.10. With the decreasing size of the R3+, less space is available, and so only five
nitrato ligands coordinate Pr3+ ions assisted by two water molecules. Thus, the icosahe￾dral surrounding is more or less maintained; the nitrato ligands find themselves in the
more spacious equatorial positions. But chemically it makes a difference whether six3.8 Solution Chemistry � 33

Here, the nitrato ligands are arranged in a trigonal bipyramidal fashion. And also these
complexes look chemically different for a solvent compared with both types described
previously.
It is really astonishing that the complexes of trivalent and tetravalent cerium are
isostructural. Ce4+ is substantially smaller than Ce3+ and comparable to the size of Lu3+
.
Therefore, tetravalent cerium features a significantly higher charge density than the
latter. On the other hand, considering the electrostatic coordination strengths of an ion i,
si =

ki
, (3.8)
introduced in Chapter 6.5.1, both Ce4+ and Lu3+ exhibit similar electrostatic coordination
strengths of sCe ≈ 0.33 and sLu = 0.30 in their respective twelve or tenfold surrounding.
In the same context, the complexes with the hexadentate ligand ethylene-diamine￾tetraacetate (EDTA4 – ) are of interest. In Figure 5.1, the complex constants are given.
Chelate complexes are of special interest since their formation is not only kinetically,
but also entropically promoted as according to

from two educt particles seven product particles are obtained. This reaction holds for
the smaller rare-earth elements, which form the most stable complexes with EDTA as
they apparently fit best into the chelate cavity displayed in Figure 3.11 (left). Here, typ￾ically two water molecules complete the eightfold coordination while for larger rare￾earth elements like neodymium a third water molecule enters the coordination sphere.34 � 3 General Trends of Physical and Chemical Behavior

Finally, I will roughly discuss a complex out of the broad field of acetylacetonato
complexes. The typically bidentate ligands comprise a central 1,3-dioxo-group capable
of coordinating metal atoms with a conjugated double bond system after deprotonation
so that both terminal carbon-oxygen bonds are of equal length. The ligand under con￾sideration here is called 6,6,7,7,8,8,8-heptafluoro-2,2-dimethyl-3,5-octanedion, or shorter

Eu(fod)3
is strongly paramagnetic due to the Eu3+ ions with an electronic configu￾ration of 4f6
. Moreover, Eu(fod)3
is a chiral complex and soluble in nonpolar organic
solvents. As Eu(fod)3
is attractive for Lewis bases, molecules featuring ether groups or
similar basic atoms may occupy the free coordination sites. This is especially interesting
if the coordinating molecules are also chiral. If two different chiral molecules interact—
one of which is enantiopure, the other not—, then diastereomers form. Such diastere￾omers are distinguishible regarding their physical properties like the chemical shifts
in n. m. r. spectra. Employing this complex, the enantiomeric excess of the coordinat￾ing molecule can be quantified. Moreover, the paramagnetic contribution of europium
to the local field influences the chemical shifts of atoms in their neighborhood signif￾icantly. Thus, complicated n. m. r. spectra can be analyzed easier. Such complexes are
called n. m. r. shift reagents [63].3.8 Solution Chemistry � 35
Furthermore, Eu(fod)3
catalyses stereoselective cyclization reactions like aldol and
Diels–Alder where the formation of the thermodynamically favored exo product can
be hindered by the complex formation to yield the kinetically controlled endo product.
Here, the bulky substituents end up on the side with the bulky bridge. For a deeper

4.1 General Aspects
The overall abundance of rare-earth elements follows a characteristic zigzag pattern
with the elements with odd atomic numbers being less abundant than those with even
ones as shown in Figure 4.1. This reflects the relative nuclear stability as this is enhanced
by even numbers of protons and neutrons, which is incompatible with an odd atomic
number. Both the classical liquid drop model by Weizsäcker29 as well as the quantum
mechanical nuclear shell model may serve to understand the lower stability of elements
with an odd atomic number further and especially the absence of stable isotopes of
promethium [64, 65]. The essence is that nuclei comprising an even number of pro￾tons and neutrons (g = gerade, German) generally are more stable than an those with
odd numbers (u = ungerade, German) like the carbon isotope 12
6
C, a g+g
g
E nucleus of an
element E. Moreover, an even number of protons yields a stronger stabilization than
an even number of neutrons. Generally, u+g
g
E nuclei are more stable than g+u
u
E nuclei.
Any isotope of a given number of nucleons can only be considered stable if no other
isotope with the same number of nucleons but different ratio of protons-to-neutrons
exists, which is more stable. For promethium with no. 61, the most stable isotopes are
those with an even number of neutrons like 145
61Pm—but 145
60Nd is slightly more stable due
to its even proton count. Accordingly, the natural abundance of promethium is almost
zero—it can be found in low concentration in uraninite as radioactive decay product of
uranium [66].

As outlined in the previous chapter, the chemical properties of the rare-earth ele￾ments develop smoothly over the whole series with increasing atomic number. Not ac￾tually surprisingly, this played an important role during formation of ores containing
rare-earth elements. Thus, usually all elements are present simultaneously with differ￾ent ratios, though. Typical rare-earth contents of minerals were given in Table 1.1. None
are found as pure elements on earth. Since all of them are oxophilic, striving for a chem￾ically harder oxidic coordination, they are predominantly dispersed in phosphates, sil￾icates or other oxidic minerals. Regarding silicates, the trivalent ions favor those com￾prising less-condensed silicate anions with decreasing size [68]. A possible explanation
delivers the increasing hardness with decreasing ionic radius of the rare-earth ions and
the decreasing hardness of silicate anions with increasing condensation degree. More￾over, generally in silica-rich rocks tend to be found smaller rare-earth ions compared
with silica-poor rocks where the larger ones tend to be favored. And again europium
adopts a diva-like role as it is—depending on the oxygen content of the surrounding
atmosphere—somewhat torn between the common trivalent and the divalent oxida￾tion state. Moreover, its physical properties are different due to its special position in
the periodic table. Europium is accordingly enriched in minerals like feldspar avoided
by its colleagues, and in contrast depleted in the more common ones, thus reducing the
yield of one of the most important elements from common ores further.
All those minerals hosting preferentially the larger rare-earth cations also concen￾trate the naturally abundant actinoid ions of thorium and uranium; thus, these minerals
usually show significant radioactivity, which is a certain problem especially during ex￾ploitation of the desired elements. The world’s mine production in 2020 and 2021 and
the reserves of rare-earth oxide equivalents are given in Table 4.1. It may be worth

4.2 Ores and Minerals
To become a commercially interesting ore, the rare-earth elements have to be concen￾trated. Generally, this may occur already by nature via weathering of less stable minerals
around very stable ones, such as bastnäsite or monazite. Subsequent washing separates
it further due to its higher density from other stable minerals of lower density; such ores
are found as sediments or in clays. In an earlier stage, the elements may be concentrated
by phase equilibria. This happens if minerals favored by rare-earth elements crystallize
due to higher melting points earlier than other competing ones. For instance, highly
melting perovskites crystallize first, if sufficient amounts of titanium are present. Even￾tually, ores are formed, which contain several rare-earth minerals as minor admixture
to other minerals. Such ores are exploited for rare-earth production, which are topic of
this section.
Concordantly with the trending ionic radii, minerals of the rare-earth elements are
roughly classified as Ce-group, Y-group and complex ones. Cerium and yttrium are the
most abundant members of the respective groups; scandium is usually contained in the
latter. Although this suggests a clear separation, this classification just indicates the main
contributors to the respective mineral with the remaining rare-earth elements being
also present as minor contribution. The most important class of rare-earth minerals for
exploitation are carbonate fluorides like bastnäsite and phosphates such as monazite.
We will shed some light on a selection out of the well over 100 rare-earth minerals
in this paragraph sorted chemically and starting with phosphates followed by silicates,
carbonates, fluorides and oxides. The contents of radioactive admixtures are listed in
[80]. The respective crystal structures and coordinations of the rare-earth ions are de￾picted in Figure 4.2. With decreasing ionic radius nature bestows three different phos￾phate phases on earth. The most important phosphate mineral is monazite, i. e.,R(PO4
)
of the Ce-group, containing predominantly larger rare-earth elements including up to 20
wght-% of thorium dioxide and 16 wght-% uranium dioxide. Therein the rare-earth ions
are coordinated by nine oxygen atoms providing a convenient coordination environ￾ment for ions of similar size of cerium; it crystallizes monoclinically and is found associ￾ated with xenotime, namely R(PO4
) of the Y-group, a tetragonal phosphate mineral. Here,
the rare-earth ions are coordinated only by eight surrounding oxygen atoms, thus suited
for slightly smaller ions—containing only up to 5 wght-% uranium dioxide. Accordingly,
xenotime contains predominantly yttrium and the smaller rare-earth ions. In apatite,

(PO4
)
3X (X = F, Cl, OH, CO3
), the rare-earth ions partially replace seven- and
nine-fold coordinated Ca2+ ions31 only slightly favoring the larger ones as the space of
the two sites differs. All phosphates may be found in pegmatites or granite-related rocks
and, of course, in weathered rocks as part of sands. Apatites are also present in marine
sediments.
By far, the largest group of minerals in the earth’s crust are silicates, and nat￾urally there are also relevant silicates hosting rare-earth ions. In allanite, namely
CaR(Al2
,Fe)[Si2O7
][SiO4
]O(OH), distinct disilicate and orthosilicate moieties coordinate
a series of different cations; here, almost exclusively larger rare-earth ions and actinoid
ions up to 3 wght-% of thorium dioxide were found. This is consistent with the high
coordination number of eleven of the rare-earth site. Titanite, a comparably frequent
nesosilicate of the typical composition CaTi(SiO4
)X (X = O, F, OH), solely contains or￾thosilicate anions. They normally prefer to host the larger rare-earth ions in contrast
to zircon, Zr(SiO4
), another nesosilicate in which the rare-earth ions and between 0.1
and 0.8 wght-% Th4+ ions find an eight-fold coordination of Zr4+. This coordination fos￾ters the presence of smaller rare-earth ions—if found in a silicate-rich granite-related
environment. In pegmatites larger rare-earth ions dominate generally, and titanite and
allanite are found in pegmatites or granite-related rocks. The noncondensed SiO4
tetra￾hedra in cerite, (R,Ca)9
(SiO4
)
3
(SiO3
(OH))4
(OH,F)3
, form closely packed layers and host
preferably the larger rare-earth ions. Further rare-earth silicates are described later in
Chapter 6.5.2.
Due to the low content of radioactive ions of up to 0.3 wght-% of thorium dioxide
and 0.1 wght-% uranium dioxide carbonate fluorides are the mainly employed minerals
for the production of rare-earth elements. Bastnäsite, R(CO3
)X (X = F, OH), is found asso￾ciated with carbonatite and magmatic alkalic rocks containing relatively low amounts
of silicon dioxide. Closely related to bastnäsite are the synchysites, which can be under￾stood by the formal addition of alkaline-earth carbonate according to MR(CO3
)
2
F (M =
Ca, Ba). In both of the discussed carbonate fluorides, the cation sites are nine-fold co￾ordinated. Since calcium and barium ions resemble the sizes of the larger rare-earth
ions, these are favored here. CaF2
, fluorite, crystallizes late, and thus rather purely from
magmatic melts; astonishingly, therein the smaller rare-earth ions are found. This is
presumably because of the higher fluorine affinity of the harder rare-earth ions, which
holds these in the melt longer than the softer ones.
Regarding oxides, as a prominent example, samarskite is mentioned here. It is com￾prised of a simple hexagonal closely packed arrangement of oxygen atoms (red and
blue in Figure 4.2) with the cations occupying zig-zag chains of octahedral voids in each
layer leading to the composition (R,U,Th,Sn,Fe,Ti)(Nb,Ta)O4
. It may contain considerable
amounts of 20 wght-% uranium and 5 wght-% thorium, but essentially also the whole
rare-earth series (Table 1.1). Finally, also the famous perovskites may feature rare-earth

ions. Perovskite, in its pure form found as Ca[TiO3
] and more generally denoted as
A[BO3
], may host a series of elements replacing both cations. On the octahedrally coor￾dinated B site, for instance, niobium, tantalum, iron or magnesium may be found; on
the twelve-fold coordinated A site, rare-earth and radioactive actinoid ions and many
others coping with large coordination numbers are situated. Since the coordination
number is rather large, here the larger rare-earth elements are preferred.
On earth, the rare-earth deposits are broadly distributed as shown in Figure 4.3
confirming the simple fact that the rare-earth elements are not actually rare, but if you
find them somewhere, they are a rare content only. For quite sometime, production sites
were almost exclusively situated in China, but during recent years several new sites
were and are being set up.
Figure 4.3: Overview on world deposits and main production sites for rare-earth elements; data from
[81, 82].5 Production
We saw in Figure 4.3 that almost in every region of the world rare-earth deposits are
known. But the concentration of rare-earth minerals in the ores is rather low. Moreover,
we learned from Chapter 3 that the chemical and physical properties develop smoothly
over the whole series of elements. Accordingly, they are found to be associated with
almost all others in relevant minerals as shown on some examples in Table 1.1; this leads
to the main two problems of any rare-earth production process, namely to concentrate
and to purify the elements.
5.1 Concentration of Rare-Earth Minerals
After surface or underground mining of hard rock deposits by drilling and blasting
methods, the ores are milled to approximately 0.1 mm sized particles. This powder is
then suspended in aqueous solutions of detergents or other suited chemicals allow￾ing for separating hydrophilic from hydrophobic particles, which is achieved by froth
flotation methods. Further techniques include gravity methods to separate minerals of
differing density, magnetism or surface charge. Eventually, concentrates of 60 to 70 %
rare-earth oxide content are achieved and separated primarily in bastnäsite and mon￾azite fractions [83]. After this physical treatment, the bastnäsite concentrates are treated
with concentrated hydrochloric or sulphuric acid to remove alkaline earth carbonates
and other remains like SiO2
, Zr(SiO4
) or TiO2
; subsequent calcination yields rare-earth
oxide contents of approximately 90 % [84]. To remove phosphate from monazite con￾centrates, either alkaline or acidic solutions are employed. As the latter does not yield
sufficiently pure products, the basic approach is the one discussed here. After dissolu￾tion of monazite in a hot concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, the rare-earth ions
including thorium are precipitated as hydroxides; the phosphate remains in solution
and is later separated as Na3
(PO4
). Thorium is separated as ThO2
by dissolving the pre￾vious product in hydrochloric acid.
Softer placer deposits are extracted using methods similar to those employed for
hard rock deposits, typically without the need for drilling and blasting. However, com￾plications may arise, especially when mining underwater. Since placers feature quite
different compositions of minerals, the extraction methods have to be adapted accord￾ingly to those mentioned above. The even softer deposits in clays allow to extract the
adsorbed rare-earth ions in situ by leaching the deposit via drilled holes. Through these
solutions like aqueous ammonium or alkaline sulphate penetrate the material to ex￾change more than 90 % of the rare-earth ions by other cations. Via drainage pipes, the
aqueous rare-earth solution is collected; the rare-earth ions are precipitated as oxalates
or carbonates from this solution, dried and decomposed to oxides containing almost
exclusively rare-earths [82].

Unfortunately, rare-earth metals and oxides are being produced also in countries
with insufficient environmental legislation and control. Accordingly, there the radioac￾tivity of many ores is not appropriately addressed with a series of dirty consequences
while there are bans on processing highly radioactive ores in Australia, Europe and
China. Further, issues related more or less to any of the employed processes are the
introduction of hazardous chemicals into the earth’s crust, and the excessive water and
solvent consumption—recurrent news report water pollution, poisoning of farmland
and of the local population. For further reading, I recommend [83] and the citations
therein.
5.2 Separation and Purification of the Elements
For applications where a separation of the elements is not urgent, the pyrophoric
alloy mischmetal is produced. Mischmetal contains the elements in their natural ore￾specific ratio as only the most relevant ones are separated from the initial solution of
all rare-earth elements. A typical mischmetal comprises 50 % cerium, 25 % lanthanum,
18 % neodymium, 5 % praseodymium and mainly iron and magnesium among the re￾maining 2 %. The mixed oxides are reduced via the metallothermic route described
in Chapter 5.3. Applications of mischmetal regarding everyday life are in flint ignition
devices of lighters and in industrial applications as alloy additives in iron and steels.
There mischmetal should react with impurities to improve the mechanical properties.
In total, around one-fifth of the global rare-earth consumption per volume is employed
as mischmetal [82].
Among the rare-earth elements, cerium and europium show a distinct redox be￾havior in an aqueous solution; cerium may be oxidized to the tetravalent state, brightly
orange Ce4+ ions, and europium may be reduced to colorless or pale yellow Eu2+ ions
(Table 3.2). Hence, these elements can be separated from the others in a quite elegant
way by redox processes and subsequent precipitation. Since cerium usually forms the
major portion, it is advantageous to remove it as early as possible from the feed. On the
contrary, as europium is one of the really rare lanthanide elements, it should be further
concentrated to facilitate efficient precipitation as a divalent ion later in the process.
Every production site employs its own separation process dependent from the spe￾cific ore used. So, Figure 5.1 displays a typical scheme based on a solvent-solvent separa￾tion. It does not cover scandium and promethium. The former is only rarely present in
rare-earth ore; instead, it is obtained from scandium deposits described below in Chap￾ter 5.2.3. Promethium as a radioactive element is not present in significant amounts.
EDTA complexes (ethylen-diamin-tetraacetate) have been employed for many years, but
certainly many other ligand systems are used nowadays. A concise discussion on for￾merly used complexes is given in Chapter 3.8.2. For example, the complex formation
constants of the respective EDTA complexes are given in the figure to get an impression
of the separation efficiency.44 � 5 Production

.
Initially, the abundant cerium is oxidized by roasting the purified and dried hydrox￾ides of the previous step in air around 600 °C. It can then be separated as CeO2
, which
is insoluble in aqueous diluted hydrochloric acid—in contrast to the other rare-earth
oxides R2O3
. In this context, the actinoid oxides ThO2
and UO2
can be partially removed
as they behave chemically similar.
Praseodymium and terbium are partially oxidized during the initial roasting pro￾cess. Hence, they are reduced back to the trivalent state prior to the separation of the
remaining trivalent rare-earth ions. The following steps are not really sophisticated but
are time, energy and solvent consuming because the R3+ ions behave so similar. Among
these, quite inefficient separation techniques like fractional crystallization or precipita￾tion were used in the past. Nowadays, ion exchange columns or solvent extraction are
used. Since the distribution coefficients are quite similar for the R3+ due to alike chemi￾cal hardness (see Table 3.7 on p. 25) many subsequent cycles have to be conducted. This
leads to the need for huge amounts of water and solvents, which are still contaminated
by radioactive thorium or uranium traces afterwards. After the liquid-liquid extraction
that is discussed below, europium is sufficiently concentrated and becomes reduced,
e. g., by the addition of zinc metal, and separated as hardly soluble carbonate Eu(CO3
) or
sulfate Eu(SO4
). This can be understood chemically. Eu2+ behaves similarly to Sr2+ due
to the matching size and charge. Thus, like the respective strontium compounds, the
carbonate and sulfate of divalent europium are hardly soluble in aqueous solutions.5.2 Separation and Purification of the Elements � 45
5.2.1 Solvent-Solvent Extraction

using the concentrations of adjacent R3+ ions A and B just above 1. A first approach to en￾hance the distribution coefficients for the solvent extraction is the addition of chelating
ligands, and a second to play skillfully with the acidity of the solutions. In the following
paragraph, this approach is demonstrated on a process suggested and reported in Green
Chemistry [88]. After that, another really innovative approach employing rare-earth￾sensitive bacteria is described. Both might reduce some of the negative implications on
the environment.
The feed employed for the herein reported solvent extraction process has the com￾position given in Table 5.1. Solvent extraction works via two immiscible solvents, typ￾ically water and organic kerosene as shown in Figure 5.2. The aqueous solution ini￾tially hosts the mixture of trivalent rare-earth ions. In the aqueous phase ligands are
dissolved carrying hydrophobic tails and acidic heads, which are deprotonated in neu￾tral water. In our considered example, the protonated ligand 2-Ethylhexyl-hydrogen-
(2-ethylhexyl)phosphonate (Figure 5.2, right) is denoted as HL, the deprotonated form
accordingly L–
. Such L–
anions occur as dimers with the protonated ligand (LH⋅ L

and typically prefer the boundary layer with the charged and polar head dissolved in

they might form micelles in the aqueous phase. The positively charged R3+ then react in
the aqueous phase with the LH⋅ L

dimers to give relatively huge neutral R(LH⋅ L)3
com￾plex molecules in which the rare-earth ions are octahedrally coordinated. These neutral
complex molecules dissolve somewhat better in the organic phase; thus, the rare-earth
ions are extracted from the aqueous phase. Certainly, equilibria depending on the acid￾ity of the aqueous solution as well as the complex formation parameter KR and the dis￾tribution coefficient of the neutral molecules between organic and aqueous phase are
achieved:

The key figure for separation are the different stability constants KR
. In the case of
the aforementioned ligand HL, smaller R3+ form more stable complexes than the larger
cations as the six-fold coordination as well as the chemical hardness of L–
apparently
better suits the smaller ions. This behavior can be found for many complex ligands em￾ployed for the rare-earth separation [85]. Consequently, the organic phase is enriched
with smaller rare-earth ions, and the aqueous solution is enriched with larger R3+ ions.
Further, the addition of ammonia to the aqueous solution somewhat buffers the basic
solution, but also ammine complexes can be formed. Since the latter are fairly flexible
regarding the coordination number, in contrast to the chelate ligand system LH⋅ L

even better stabilization of the larger R3+ in the aqueous phase is achieved. After equi￾libration, both solutions are transferred to the next chamber according to Figure 5.2.

rare-earth ions, while the aqueous phase now equilibrates with another organic solu￾tion R(HL2

phases are further enriched in smaller R3+ in the organic phase and in larger rare-earth
ions in the aqueous phase.
Because of the reverse feed of organic and aqueous phase, the separation advances
quite fast (Figure 5.2). Although this treatment is quite efficient, depending on the de￾sired purity of the rare-earth ions, normally a few tens up to a thousand of such cy￾cles have to be conducted. After the desired separation degree is achieved, the complex
molecules dissolved in the organic phase are destroyed by the addition of basic ammo￾nia shifting the equilibrium in Equation (5.2) to the left side as then all HL of the treated5.2 Separation and Purification of the Elements � 47
fraction will be deprotonated and the R3+ will be precipitated as hydroxides. Eventually,
oxides are obtained.
5.2.2 Further Separation Approaches
Many more processes for the separation of rare-earth elements have been proposed,
such as to extract rare-earth elements by ionic liquids or by employing nonaqueous sol￾vents like polar organic ones [89, 90]. Here, I will describe two other approaches: a bio￾genic one and some ideas for the recycling of rare-earth elements from devices.
A few years ago, a very interesting biogenic approach to separate rare-earth ele￾ments employing marine bacteria of the roseobacter family was reported [91]. As ma￾rine bacteria, they are tolerant against concentrated salt solutions. Remarkably, they
also tolerate really acidic solutions and provide three surface sites of different acidy
with approximate pKa values of 2, 3.7 and 5.5. These presumably consist of phosphate
groups. For the experiments, the bacteria were immobilized on an assay filter and fully
protonated before being exposed to an aqueous solution containing equimolar amounts
of rare-earth ions, which then are exchanged with the surface-bound protons. The rare￾earth ions are subsequently desorbed with increasing pH; the smaller (and harder) the
rare-earth ions are, the stronger they are bound to the bacterial sites yielding an aston￾ishingly good separation efficiency.
The truly rare rare-earth elements should be recycled from wasted materials as
their mining, separation and production is extremely time, money and energy consum￾ing. Moreover, the respective applications already concentrate on certain suited element
combinations. Therefore, the recycling should be done sorted by the applications, such
as permanent magnets, accounting for about 40 %, phosphors (30 %) and nickel alloy bat￾teries (10 %) [92]. Permanent magnets mainly contain neodymium, praseodymium and
dysprosium. These elements have to be separated as their ratio varies with the concrete
application. For instance, dysprosium enhances the stability against demagnetization,
which in many cases, is urgently necessary while it is not in others. Phosphors, on the
other hand, may be recycled as phosphor materials, though. The main problem here is
contained mercury if recycled from compact fluorescent lamps, which requires a ther￾mal treatment above 600 °C to get rid of the toxic metal. Moreover, upon the crushing of
the lamps, the phosphors are contaminated with silicon dioxide and alumina. From such
mixtures, the phosphor particles may be separated magnetically [93]. Unfortunately, the
recycling of battery materials is considered seldom. Here, on the other hand, often mis￾chmetal is employed, which is quite cheap, and together with nickel, such waste is added
to steel.48 � 5 Production
5.2.3 Scandium
Scandium is not a rare, but a very scarce element. Looking at Figure 4.1, it is less abun￾dant than cerium, lanthanum, neodymium and yttrium, but its distribution within the
earth crust is finer. Sc3+ are the chemically hardest ions of the rare-earth elements and
resemble the behavior of hard acids like zirconium, tantalum and especially aluminium
in many cases—accordingly, one of its major applications is the hardening of aluminium
alloys. The main scandium minerals are thortveitite, Sc2
[Si2O7
] (Chapter 6.5.2 and Fig￾ure 6.23) and kolbeckite, Sc(PO4
) ⋅ 2 H2O shown in Figure 5.3, which are mainly found in
Norway and Madagascar. However, these deposits are not exploited to date. It is also con￾tained in zircon where it usually replaces Zr(SiO4
) with Sc(PO4
), sometimes as its own
mineral, petrulite. Scandium is occasionally found in metorites as allendeite, Sc4
Zr3O12, a
scandium zirconate adopting the structure of Tb7O12 (see Figure 6.17) [94]. Finally, there
is also a very rare mineral containing tantalum named heftetjernite, ScTaO4
, crystalliz￾ing in the wolframite type and also displayed in Figure 5.3.

Scandium was historically produced in regions of the former Soviet Union, i. e.,
Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. Nowadays, the main production sites are in China,
the Philippines and Australia using any mineral or waste where it occurs as a minor
contribution. Thus, it is normally recovered from various sources such as uranium
leach liquors, titanium pigment production, tungsten refineries and certainly also from
rare-earth element production residues. Since precipitation methods do not yield pure
products, also here a solvent extraction resembling the aforementioned approach is
the method of choice. For further reading regarding this subject, I refer to [97]; there
are also further techniques being reviewed such as ion exchange or liquid membrane
processes. From these sources, Sc2O3
is the starting material for the production of the
element, which then is normally converted into the trifluoride ScF3
likewise cerium.
For the reduction to the pure element, the same metallothermic approach as for almost
all other rare-earth elements is used which is the subject of the next section. Here, in
case of scandium calcium metal is employed as reduction agent.5.3 Obtaining the Elements � 49
5.3 Obtaining the Elements
At the end of the industrial separation process, cerium oxide, europium carbonate or
europium sulfate were obtained besides the oxides of the other rare-earth elements. To
get the pure elements by a suited reduction an electrolysis of the halides would be desir￾able. A review of the reduction potentials in Table 3.3 (see Chapter 3.8) and considering
the relevant potential in neutral water
2 H2O + 2 e− 󳨀󳨀󳨀⇀↽󳨀󳨀󳨀 H2 + 2OH−
, E

= −0.8277 V (5.3)
tells us that it is impossible to get the reduction done from an aqueous solution. Looking
at Figure 6.4 (Chapter 6.2), the chlorides seem interesting due to their comparably low
melting points, and indeed the europium metal is obtained by electrolysis of EuCl3
in
an eutectic mixture with rock salt. Certainly, the chlorides have to be synthesized first,
and this is also challenging to avoid formation of the halide oxides ROX as discussed in
Chapter 6.2.1.
The alternative method is the destillation of europium metal after a metallothermic
reduction by reacting the oxide with less noble metals such as lanthanum; with more re￾active metals, the reactions proceed too vigorously in the case of europium. Pure cerium
can be obtained by the reduction of its anhydrous fluoride CeF3 with calcium metal; this
latter method is a quite general method to obtain the remaining rare-earth metals,
2 RF3 + 3 Ca 󳨀󳨀󳨀→ 2 R + 3 CaF2
, (5.4)
which yields the very stable CaF2
. Calcium fluoride melts around 1420 °C and can be sep￾arated either due to its differing melting point or its differing density from the respective
rare-earth metal. The metals exhibit a silvery luster, but show different hardnesses. The
softer ones like cerium, europium and ytterbium may be cut with a knife, the others
with pincers. Scandium and lutetium are significantly harder [82]. For the reactivity of
the pure elements, please refer to Chapter 3.7.6 Basic Compound Classes
6.1 Hydrogen Compounds
Personally, I prefer to name them hydrogen compounds, although in most cases, it is
well justified to call them hydrides since without question the hydrogen atoms will be
negatively polarized due to the higher electronegativity of hydrogen compared with the
rare-earth elements. But you should not expect to find salt-like hydrides containing H–
anions in the rare-earth hydrogen compounds and I certainly do not intend to suggest
that in the cases where I call them hydrides.
It is generally quite important that the rare-earth elements consume gaseous hydro￾gen already at room temperature to a certain extent. This has to be considered for any
property measurements of metallic samples as traces of hydrogen might change the re￾sults significantly. Due to its low electron density, hydrogen might be overseen in X-ray
diffraction, so a careful treatment of all respective samples is strongly recommended.
Under moderate conditions below 500 °C, the rare-earth elements react readily with hy￾drogen to form hydrides of different compositions. All react via an exothermic reaction,
R + H2 󳨀󳨀󳨀→ RH2
, (6.1)
to the dihydrides. Their enthalpies of formation resemble more these of the heavier
alkaline-earth metals than those of the outer transition metals with hydrogen. Most of
the rare-earth elements proceed further to RH3
. Typically, the resulting structures are
intercalation compounds hosting the negatively polarized hydrogen atoms in the voids
of close packings related to the metal’s structure. Close packings provide two tetrahedral
voids per atom, which are predominantly filled by hydrogen in the first instance, and
one octahedral void per atom. The latter is increasingly occupied during hydrogenation
toward RH3
. Moreover, the hydrogen compounds rarely form stoichiometric compounds
but feature a significant phase width. This behavior is in accordance with a subsequent
intercalation into the metal’s crystal and electronic structure. Therefore, the hydrogen
compounds start as metallic intercalates and smoothly approach semiconducting be￾havior [98].
Scandium, ytterbium and europium do not form trihydrides at all under ambient
pressure. As stated previously, europium shows a tendency to the divalent state as then
a half-filled 4 f7
shell is achieved and especially then realized in compounds with reduc￾ing anions such as hydride H–
or iodide I –
. Compounds of Eu3+ with reducing anions
are commonly unstable. Scandium on the other hand is the smallest of all rare-earth el￾ements and crystallizes in a hexagonal close packing where the tetrahedral voids share
common faces. Hence, in a hypothetical ScH3
the hydride anions came too close. Only
under high pressure, hydrides up to YbH2.55 were reported, which adopt the LaH3
struc￾ture.
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110680829-0066.1 Hydrogen Compounds � 51
The hydrogen compound with the highest hydrogen content, i. e., LaH10, was ob￾tained in a diamond anvil cell around a high pressure of 170 GPa heated to 2000 K.
Therein, the lanthanum atoms adopt a face-centered cubic arrangement enclosed by a
hydrogen clathrate featuring H32 cages around each lanthanum atom [99]. The authors
describe this (under ambient pressure unstable) compound as a form of metallic hydro￾gen doped with lanthanum metal. For materials chemistry, it remains a curiosity despite
its relevance for chemistry as a whole. Further details on the hydrogen compounds and
their properties may be studied in [100] where most of the herein discussed data were
taken.
6.1.1 Structures and Bonding of RH2
and RH3
The hydrogen compounds RH2
of scandium, and from lanthanum to neodymium adopt
the structure of fluorite, CaF2
. Therein the R atoms replace calcium and the hydrogen
atoms fluorine. These hydrogen compounds form solid solutions with the respective RH3
in which also the octahedral voids are occupied. Finally, for RH3
a structure isotypic with
the Heusler phase AlCu2Mn is obtained where aluminium atoms (blue) form a cubic
close packing with copper atoms in all tetrahedral (yellow) and manganese atoms in all
octahedral voids (white) as displayed in Figure 6.1 in the example of LaH3
or Appendix D.
Important crystal structure types no. 1–fluorite, CaF2
: The crystal structure of the CaF2
type is illustrated
in Figure 6.1 (left) by omitting the white spheres. It consists of a cubic close packed arrangement of cal￾cium atoms (blue) with all tetrahedral voids occupied by fluorine atoms (yellow); in each closely packed
structure, two tetrahedral and one octahedral void per packing atom is found. In the case of a cubic close
packing, also dubbed face centered cubic packing, adjacent voids only share common vertices. This struc￾ture type is adopted by various rare-earth element compounds. For the basics of this structure related to
others, see also Appendix D.

and fluorite by omitting the white

blue and red; data: [101, 102].52 � 6 Basic Compound Classes
A slightly different behavior is found for the elements from samarium through lutetium
and yttrium, except europium and ytterbium. These also adopt the fluorite-type struc￾ture for the composition up to RH2
. For higher hydrogen contents, the structures switch
to a hexagonal close arrangement of the cations consistent with a relative movement
of adjacent cation layers—thus going from an ABCABC to an ABABAB sequence. In Fig￾ure 6.1 (right), the cation layers are indicated by blue and red spheres. Still both tetrahe￾dral voids are occupied (yellow spheres), but now they share common faces. The third
hydrogen atom (white) is hosted on two sites more or less within the cation layers and
coordinated by three cations as shown in Figure 6.1 on the example of GdH3
. This re￾sulting structure is that of the fluocerite or tysonite structure type (LaF3
). In the halide
section, an alternative structure description based on a close packing of anions is dis￾cussed. Interestingly, there was a controversy about this very crystal structure since the
small electron density of hydrogen inhibited a straightforward structure determination.
A careful combination of neutron and X-ray diffraction revealed a threefold superstruc￾ture perpendicular to the c-axis and finally yielded the ordered satisfactory structure
model discussed in the previous paragraph [102]. Here, the third hydrogen atom is dis￾tributed over two sites. Both are coordinated by three rare-earth cations, one slightly
off the triangular plane, the other within the plane. This superstructure slightly reduces
the average hydrogen-hydrogen as well as the R–H distances.
Considering the ionic radii of La3+ and Gd3+, it is reasonable that the former are co￾ordinated by fourteen in LaH3
and the latter are coordinated by only eleven hydrogen
atoms in the GdH3
structure (Table 6.1). Although it sounds strange to me that apparently
the larger La3+ ion prefers a structure, in which the third hydrogen atom occupies a com￾parably larger octahedral site, while in GdH3
the third hydrogen atom only experiences
a threefold coordination. Moreover, the smaller tetrahedral voids sharing common faces
are found in the GdH3
structure, where the hydrogen atoms come even closer to each
other (209 pm vs. 243 pm). To get an idea about the electrostatic interactions within both
structure types, MAPLE calculations were conducted (see the info box). Detailed results
of the calculations are listed in Appendix F.1. Indeed for both, LaH3
and GdH3
, the exper￾imentally found crystal structure matches the electrostatically favored one with respect
to the other structure type. I certainly adjusted the lattice parameters to get similar R–H

distances for the tetrahedral voids. The results suggest that indeed electrostatic reasons
cause the choice of structure type here.
Madelung Part of Lattice Energy (MAPLE): The MAPLE concept was developed by Rudolf Hoppe.32 Thereby
the electrostatic interactions in ionic crystals are quantified and used to determine effective coordination
numbers, effective charges and to check the reasonability of structure models [103–105]. The calculation
also yields a good estimate of the electrostatic contribution to the lattice energy of the material under
consideration as used in the examples LaH3
and GdH3
. Further applications are the localization of protons,
the determination of ordering of differently charged cations like Si4+ and Al3+ in cases where diffraction
methods do not deliver reliable evidence.
The dihydrides of europium and ytterbium behave like the ionic alkaline-earth hydrides
and are thus isolators, in contrast to all other dihydrides. Likewise the alkaline-earth hy￾drides, both realize the cottunite type structure (PbCl2
). Here, the hydrogen atoms form
a distorted hexagonal close packing. In Figure 6.2, the two layers in EuH2
are indicated
by yellow and white spheres, respectively. The europium atoms (blue) are for several
reasons too large for both, the tetrahedral as well as the octahedral voids. Accordingly,
they formally expand the close layer locally and move into the triangular face shared
by two adjacent octahedral voids; this is illustrated by the larger triangles spanned by
yellow atoms and emphasized by broken lines (Figure 6.2, left). Thus, a larger ninefold￾coordinated void is achieved where the metal atoms are surrounded by a three-capped
trigonal prism. For the basics of the cottunite structure related to others, see also Ap￾pendix D.

; the distorted closely packed layers of hydrogen atoms in yellow and white, the metal atoms

Due to the higher electronegativity, the hydrogen states are localized at significantly
lower energies relative to the Fermi level and the rare-earth elements states. Hence,
upon hydrogen uptake, electron density is transferred from the highest metals’ states—
typically 5d and 6s—into the hydrogen band yielding polar hydrides with fairly localized
32 Rudolf Hoppe, German chemist (*1922 †2014).54 � 6 Basic Compound Classes
electrons therein. With the increasing transfer of electron density, the conductivity of
the materials shrinks until a semiconducting behavior is observed. In agreement with
this preliminary remark, the chemical bonding is generally described as metallic for
all dihydrides except EuH2
and YbH2
, which are predominantly ionic compounds. All
existing trihydrides are semiconductors, and somewhere between RH2
and RH3
a metal￾to-semiconductor transition occurs.
Magnetically there is almost no change with increasing hydrogen uptake for the el￾ements cerium through samarium. Here, the 4f electrons remain at the rare-earth core.
Between europium and thulium slightly decreasing magnetic moments were observed
with increasing hydrogen content. In the case of gadolinium, the ferromagnetic order￾ing of the metal vanishes upon hydrogenation. The ytterbium hydrides show increas￾ing paramagnetism with increasing hydrogen content while the metal is diamagnetic;
apparently, some electron density is transferred from the fully occupied 4 f14 states in
ytterbium onto the hydrogen atoms. In contrast to europium metal, EuH2
orders ferro￾magnetically below 25 K.
6.1.2 Hydrogen Storage—LaNi5
Not only, but mainly climate change issues, foster the development of hydrogen storage
materials. Over the last decades, many compounds have been investigated and novel
materials are being developed, but there are a few really prominent evergreens in this
field. Among these, LaNi5
is the one which contains rare-earth elements as a crucial
component. Nowadays, instead of pure lanthanum, usually mischmetal is employed as
this features a very similar chemical behavior, provides similarly sized voids, and by the
way, is significantly more affordable than the pure metals.
The late outer transition metals like nickel exhibit too small voids to allow for quick
uptake and release of hydrogen. Moreover, the chemical bonding mainly stems from
rather weak interactions with the very broad 4s band since there are only antibonding
interactions with the 3d states [17]. The consequence here is that metals like nickel nicely
work as catalysts where hydrogen is briefly bound to the metallic surface, and thus ac￾tivated. As discussed in the previous chapter, rare-earth elements readily form stable
metallic dihydrides RH2
since these metals provide sufficiently large voids and bonding
interactions. The latter are too strong for releasing hydrogen again easily, so the pure
compounds RH2
are not really suited as hydrogen storage materials. So, it seems promis￾ing to combine a metal with excellent hydrogen uptake behavior like lanthanum with
a metal like nickel, which only weakly interacts with hydrogen. Moreover, these met￾als should be as cheap as possible—and there we are with lanthanum or mischmetal
and nickel. The stable compound that forms is LaNi5
. In a typical approach, this hydro￾gen storage material reacts readily at room temperature under a smooth overpressure6.1 Hydrogen Compounds � 55

(6.2)
and yields LaNi5H6
. The hydrogen can then be released again by slight heating. Appar￾ently, the aforementioned combination yields a material, which provides sufficiently
large voids, sufficiently strong bonding and a sufficient reversibility of hydrogen up￾take and release. The stored hydrogen per cubic meter amounts to 88 kg, which is more
than the 71 kg a cubic meter of liquid hydrogen weighs. On the other hand, the overall
weight of the material itself is quite high with only 1.5 wght-% hydrogen storage capacity
rendering it unattractive for applications as long as weight plays an important role.
The crystal structure of LaNi5
adopts the CaCu5
-type structure and is shown in Fig￾ure 6.3. Here, a layer A comprises a kagomé33 net of nickel atoms, a frequently occur￾ring motif in metal-rich phases. Such a kagomé net may be understood as a deficient
close packed layer where a quarter of all atoms was removed. Layer B comprises a close
packed layer of lanthanum atoms with further nickel atoms in any triangular void. Fol￾lowing a layer sequence AB, the structure is obtained where the lanthanum atoms of
layer B lie directly below and above the voids of the kagomé net of layer A. The lan￾thanum atoms are coordinated by eighteen nickel atoms while the nickel atoms are sur￾rounded by four (Ni situated on layer A) or three (Ni situated on layer B) lanthanum
atoms as well as eight or nine nickel atoms—yielding a total coordination number of
twelve. The voids for the hydrogen atoms indicated as white spheres in Figure 6.3 are

found between both layers. There the hydrogen atoms are situated in distorted tetra￾hedral voids formed by a lanthanum and three nickel atoms, essentially one void per
metal atom.
6.2 Binary Halides and Halide Oxides
Amid the numerous halides of the rare-earth elements, the most common ones are the
trivalent, tetravalent and divalent ones. Aside of these, also various somewhat reduced
halides were characterized. In this book, I will certainly focus on the most common ones
and just mention some more general remarks on the remaining ones as relevant prop￾erties of the latter are also found among the former. Moreover, the pure halides show
interesting structure systematics, which I will address in this chapter. Figure 6.4 gives
an overview about the polymorphism and the melting points of the known divalent,
trivalent and tetravalent halides. For further reading [108–111] are recommended.

symbols resemble the relative size of the ion; data: [29, 112–114].6.2 Binary Halides and Halide Oxides � 57
6.2.1 Trihalides RX3
Overview and Syntheses
Considering Figure 6.4, almost all possible combinations of rare-earth elements and fluo￾rine, chlorine, bromine and iodine have been reported. As frequently mentioned before,
again europium and ytterbium behave like divas because both may be reduced quite
easily to the divalent state; hence, all trihalides of both with reducing halides are fairly
unstable. While EuI3
has not been reported at all, EuBr3
decomposes [115] according to
2 EuBr3
390 °C
󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀→ 2 EuBr2 + Br2
. (6.3)
The melting point of EuBr3
given in some places is in fact that of the hexahydrate
[R(H2O)6
]X3
[113]. For YbBr3
at least a melting point could be determined, but YbI3
analogously decomposes around 700 °C. This nicely shows the slightly higher relative
stability of europium’s divalent state.
Generally, the hygroscopicity of the halides increases from the fluorides to the io￾dides following the increasing softness of the anions. The smallest anion in this series
is the fluoride yielding the shortest R–Hal interatomic distances and the highest coor￾dination numbers. Accordingly, the lattice energy is maximized here, and thus the fluo￾rides show the highest melting points ranging between 1143 °C for HoF3
and 1552 °C for
ScF3
. The chlorides’ melting points were reported between 582 °C for TbCl3
and 967 °C
for ScCl3
.
According to the HSAB concept, R3+ ions are relatively hard cations, and thus pre￾fer interaction with hard bases such as fluoride or oxide. Because of this high oxygen
affinity, the synthesis of anhydrous halides is challenging with exception of the fluorides.
These can be obtained with good yields starting from the aqueous chlorides via

by reaction with hydrogen fluoride and subsequent dehydration. Alternatively, they
may be synthesized via the following ammonium chloride route employing (NH4

at temperatures around 100 °C yields hydrated
ammonium hexafluorolanthanidate (NH4

RF6
, which can be smoothly decomposed to
give pure RF3
. The chlorides and bromides are most easily obtained via the ammonium
halide route from the oxides, and later improved and developed further by Meyer34
[116, 111]. A drawback for this approach is the high oxygen affinity of the rare-earth ions
preventing quantitative reaction and leaving significant amounts of oxygen in the final
products; this especially holds for the softer halides of chloride, bromide and iodide.

amounts of halide oxides like ROX as side products. These can be separated by sub￾limation under high vacuum and at temperatures of up to 950 °C in tantalum vessels

reading regarding the syntheses of the trihalides, the already cited literature is recom￾mended. The trihalides typically show the colors of the R3+ ions as mentioned earlier
(Chapter 3.6).
Structures and Structure Systematics
With the decreasing size of the cations less anions can coordinate, and certainly the
larger the anions become the smaller the coordination number. Since almost all trivalent
halides are known and all of these compounds are ionic, this trend can be seen nicely
in Figure 6.4 starting from a coordination number (c. n.) of eleven in LaF3
, decreasing
via nine for the YF3
and UCl3
structure types to c. n. eight in the PuBr3
structure, and
finally dropping to c. n. six for representatives like ScI3
adopting the FeCl3
, the related
AlCl3
or the ReO3
structure types. In this section, these structure types will be briefly
described and compared. The crystal structures discussed here are those reported at
room temperature and ambient pressure. For instance, for SmF3
at room temperature
the YF3
structure is found, but at elevated temperatures the LaF3
structure type was6.2 Binary Halides and Halide Oxides � 59

reported [119]. Or for ScF3
at ambient pressure, the ReO3
structure type is described but
at high pressures the YF3
type structure is achieved; these details will not be treated here.
For further structure relations especially at higher temperature and pressure, please
refer to the literature referenced in the introduction to this chapter.
LaF3
consists of closely packed fluoride layers with a layer sequence hcc indicated in
yellow, red and blue in Figure 6.5 (left). All layers are expanded so much that the La3+ fit
into the triangular voids of the yellow distorted layer. Thus, lanthanum is coordinated by
three fluorine atoms in the same layer (h layer), by six of the blue and by further two of
the red layer (c layers). In total, eleven fluorine atoms coordinate every lanthanum atom
forming a so-called Edshammar polyhedron [122]. An alternative structure description
based on close packed lanthanum layers is given in Chapter 6.1.1.
YF3
adopts the anticementite structure, i. e., Fe3
C, with fluorine on the iron and yt￾trium on the carbon sites. This crystal structure can be understood by a concept named
chemical twinning [123, p. 121]; we will make use of this approach in this chapter sev￾eral times. Here, relevant structure motifs such as fragments of close packed layers are
formally twinned by virtual mirror planes like in the YF3
structure. Apparently, the octa￾hedral voids in a close packed structure of fluorine atoms were too small to host the large
yttrium ions properly. So, fragments of a hexagonal close packing of fluorine layers, in￾dicated in blue in Figure 6.5, are twinned via virtual mirror planes running through
the yellow fluorine atoms. By this 3,3-twinning trigonal prismatic voids are generated
instead of octahedral voids with contacts to further three fluorine atoms resulting in a
tricapped trigonal prismatic coordination around the yttrium atoms.
In ScF3
, i. e., the ReO3
type, all scandium atoms are surrounded octahedrally by flu￾orine atoms. These octahedra share common vertices along all directions resulting in60 � 6 Basic Compound Classes

a structure closely related to perovskite lacking only the alkaline-earth atoms therein
(Figure 6.6).
The uranium atoms in the UCl3
structure type choose a similar approach like the
lead atoms in PbCl2—realized in EuH2
(Chapter 6.1.1). Here, the chlorine atoms form a
hexagonal close arrangement; the layers are indicated with blue and red spheres in Fig￾ure 6.6. To host the uranium atoms, both layers are distorted to fit the uranium atoms
in selected triangular voids. Thus, two adjacent octahedral voids fuse via their shared
face and lead to a ninefold-coordination sphere around the uranium atoms, a tricapped
trigonal prism. In this structure type, the anion-anion distances are potentiallly smaller
compared with the structure type of YF3
. But here the anions are larger, and thus expe￾rience less electrostatic repulsion.
In the PuBr3
structure type, essentially the same layers indicated in blue and red
like in UCl3
are found. Also here, they form a hexagonal close packing. But these layers
are somewhat more distorted than there, thus reducing the coordination number of the
cations from nine to eight—a bicapped trigonal prism (Figure 6.7). Due to this distortion,

in PuBr3
the empty channels are clearly smaller than in UCl3
. The difference between
the hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence AB and the cubic close packing with
layer sequence ABC is that in the former the atoms experience in average slightly smaller
distances. There is no difference in the first two coordination spheres where twelve and
six atoms are seen; but in the third—the next but one layer of atoms further—the atoms
of the next A layer show smaller distances than those of the respective C layer in cubic
packings. Therefore, more ionic compounds prefer the cubic close, more covalent com￾pounds the hexagonal close packed structures. Considering the halides, the tendency to
covalent and dispersive interactions markedly increases from fluoride to iodide.
So, the AlCl3
structure type where a cubic close packing of chlorine atoms hosts alu￾minum atoms in two-thirds of every second layers’ octahedral voids is indeed preferred
by the harder halides than the FeCl3
structure type adopted by the softer halides. Here,
the chlorine atoms form a hexagonal close packed structure with the same occupation
of octahedral voids than in AlCl3
. Both structures are depicted in Figure 6.7.

6.2.3 Reduced Halides
Like the hydrogen compounds, the halogen compounds also feature a broad variety
of compositions between the full oxidation states. In this chapter on binary reduced
halides, my focus lies on the simple divalent compounds RX2
. At the end of this chapter,
properties of selected examples of reduced halides will be mentioned. Especially in this
topic, the famous chemists Bärnighausen,35 Simon,36 Corbett37 and Meyer34 contributed
groundbreaking work.
Overview and Syntheses
Figure 6.4 illustrates impressively the dominance of the oxidation state +III in rare-earth
chemistry; almost all combinations of rare-earth elements with halogens have been re￾ported over the last century. Considering the divalent compounds, only a few elements
form truly ionic halides, and certainly those where a reduction from trivalent to the
divalent state is conceivable— such as europium, ytterbium and samarium (Table 3.3,
p. 30). For these, even fluorides can be synthesized, which is remarkable as fluorides usu￾ally stabilize higher oxidation states. Iodides however stabilize lower oxidation states
due to their reduction potential. Accordingly, a majority of the rare-earth elements at
least forms the diiodides RI2 with the exception of holmium, where only HoCl2 was re￾ported to date [130–132].
Generally, the reduced halides show considerable phase widths; so normally long
reaction times are necessary to achieve homogeneous products. A typical synthetic ap￾proach is the comproportionation of the respective rare-earth elements and its trivalent
halide in sealed tantalum containers enclosed in glass ampoules according to endother￾mic reactions

for which the reaction enthalpy almost solely depends from the different lattice ener￾gies, e. g.,
ΔE ≈ 2U(RF3
) − 3U(RF2
) (6.14)
with the lattice energy U [133–136]. Since the fluorides are by far the smallest ions allow￾ing for the largest coordination numbers, the lattice energy differences are comparably
large there. This is reflected in the reaction enthalpies, and thus confirms the aforemen￾tioned better stabilization of higher oxidation states. Further, the synthesis of reduced
rare-earth halides can succeed via a metallothermic reduction with alkaline metals ac￾cording to
LaI3 + 2 Na 550 °C
󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀→ LaI + 2 NaI (6.15)
at comparably lower temperatures as long as no ternary phases form [137–139]. The al￾kaline halides may be removed by treatment with solvents like anhydrous diglyme38
as the rare-earth compounds are sensitive to humidity. Another synthetic approach is
the reduction of the trihalides with hydrogen—only successful for europium, ytterbium
and samarium—or a direct electrochemical reduction [140]. Detailed syntheses are de￾scribed in [112, 141].
Structures and Bonding
Most of the dihalides are ionic compounds except those of the rare-earth elements
which either occur only as trivalent ions or even tetravalent ions—lanthanum, cerium,
praseodymium and gadolinium. While the former can safely be described as salts
R
2+(X–
)
2
, the latter are metallic according to R3+(X–
)
2
⋅ e
– where the rare-earth atoms
are present as trivalent ions with the surplus electron being itinerant in the conduction
band. The latter feature the structure of MoSi2 while the former adopt typical structures
of ionic compounds discussed previously.
The only known fluorides (SmF2
, EuF2
and YbF2
) crystallize isotypically with fluo￾rite (Figure 6.1). The dichlorides show a nice trend of decreasing coordination numbers
from the larger to the smaller rare-earth elements starting from the cottunite type struc￾ture (Figure 6.2) with a ninefold coordination. Eightfold coordination is then realized in
NdI2
, SmBr2
, DyCl2
and EuBr2
by adopting the SrBr2
structure type. Figure 6.9 displays
motifs of the crystal structure of EuBr2
. Here, the europium atoms form a distorted cu￾bic close packing. In the tetrahedral voids, the bromine atoms are situated. You might
now expect a structure similar to that of fluorite and a cubic surrounding of the cations.
But here, the distortion of the close packing yields a square antiprismatic surrounding
of the first europium atom and to a quite similar coordination of the second for which a

; shown are the three layers of the distorted cubic close packing of
europium atoms (blue, yellow and red) in two different orientations including the local surroundings with
(green) bromine atoms as well as the unit cell; data: [142].
7+1 coordination is found with a single bromine atom further away (Eu–Br: 309–328 and
352 pm). MAPLE calculations (see the info box in Chapter 6.1.1 and Appendix F.2) confirm
a significant electrostatic contribution of the eighth bromine atom to the coordination.
In the monoclinic EuI2
structure type, the coordination number is further reduced
to seven. This structure may be understood by using the chemical twinning approach
discussed earlier in this chapter. A 3,3-twinning was discussed there for YF3
; here, a
2,2-twinning of a hexagonal close packing of bromine atoms can be deduced from Fig￾ure 6.10. On the mirror planes, also trigonal prismatic voids are generated. In contrast to
YF3
, here only one further halide ion is in reach to complete the sevenfold coordination
around europium.
A slightly less denser structure than that of EuI2
is the orthorhombic SrI2
structure
type, which is related to that of EuI2
. Simply spoken, the mirror plane containing the
yellow atoms in Figure 6.10 becomes broader due to a relative tilting of the coordina￾tion polyhedra, which apparently is the reason for the doubling of the unit cell here.
The coordination polyhedra are very similar. YbBr2

consists of a cubic close packed arrangement of chlorine atoms (red, blue and
green layers) with all octahedral voids of every second layer occupied by cadmium atoms (grey); in each
close packed structure, two tetrahedral and one octahedral void per packing atom is found. In the case
of CdI2
, the same occupation scheme of the octahedral voids is found, but this structure is based on a
hexagonal close packing of the iodide atoms. These structure types are adopted by various rare-earth
element compounds. For the basics of this structure related to others, see also Appendix D.
The metallic diiodides RI2
(R = La, Ce, Pr, Gd) crystallize in the MoSi2
structure type
shown in Figure 6.11. Here, the metal atoms are coordinated by ten iodide atoms in the
form of a bicapped cube. The whole structure can be understood as it is built up by
CsCl units shifted with respect to their neighbors. In CsCl, a primitive cubic packing of
chlorine hosts caesium atoms in the cubic voids.

Selected Further Examples and Their Properties
On mixed valent europium halides intervalence charge transfer transitions and electron
hopping were scrutinized. This will be addressed in Chapter 8.2.2. Metallic GdI2
shows
ferromagnetic ordering (TC = 290 K) and a giant negative magnetoresistance (GMR)39
of approximately 70 % at room temperature and 7 Tesla [147]. Thanks to the success￾ful metallothermic reduction of LaI3 with sodium and the separation of NaI phase pure
samples of LaI could be thoroughly investigated. Electronic structure calculations con￾firmed the metallic behavior according to La3+(I –
) ⋅ 2 e –
. Surprisingly, for a material of
the NiAs structure type (Appendix D), almost no covalent metal-metal interactions along
the c axis but within the ab plane were identified. Physical property measurements con￾firmed the metallic behavior despite a quite low density of states at the Fermi level [138].

Also, for halide oxides—or oxyhalides—a manifold of compositions was reported, such
as Gd4O3

, Sm4OI6
, Lu3O2

or Eu3O4
Br. In this chapter, I will focus on the basic and
most important ROX compounds. Their synthesis frequently occurs involuntarily if, e. g.,
an anhydrous halide was intended to be made from an oxygen containing source. Com￾pared with the heavier halides, oxide is always the harder ion, and thus preferred ac￾cording to

forming the respective halide oxide in an open reaction vessel [112, p. 1085]. Further
heating in air yields at first halide oxides with higher oxygen content and finally the
sesquioxides. Another very reliable so-called ammonium halide route runs via partial
formation of an ammonium halogeno complex

] + 6 NH3 + 3 H2O (6.17)
as discussed in the course of the synthesis of the trivalent halides. To target the halide
oxides, usually a suited ratio of ammonium halide to sesquioxide corresponding to
2 NH4X + R2O3
230 °C
󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀→ 2 ROX + 2 NH3 + H2O (6.18)
is employed, which requires a careful stoichiometric control of the starting materials of
this latter reaction to obtain the desired halide oxide [148, 149].
Contrarily, fluoride and oxide show a comparable chemical hardness. Moreover, the
fluorides show a certain volatility. Therefore, the ROF require syntheses in closed ves￾sels, such as platinum tubes sealed by squeezing both ends, at quite high temperatures
corresponding to
R2O3 + RF3

󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀→ 3 ROF (6.19)
by reaction of the sesquioxide with the trifluoride [112, p. 256]. The discussion addressed
all rare-earth elements except the scandium and cerium compounds. The above reac￾tions yield only the dioxide CeO2
in open systems due to its tendency to form oxidation
state IV. Further, the higher oxophilia of scandium prevents success via these routes.
Hence, scandium and cerium halide oxides have to be synthesized like the ROF in closed
vessels under the exclusion of oxygen or in an alkaline metal halide flux [150, 151].6.2 Binary Halides and Halide Oxides � 67
Structure Chemistry
Unfortunately, not all possible combinations of structure data are available as yet, but
considering usual trends the information of reliable data bases and several original pub￾lications deliver a quite complete picture so that the missing members can be extrapo￾lated [152–157]. Regarding the crystal structures, the cerium and scandium compounds
play their own role; therefore, they will be discussed briefly at the end of this section. The
general rule for the remaining halide oxides is that the coordination number decreases
from the largest La3+ to the smallest Lu3+ ions (Figure 6.14). Since apparently the size of
the ions plays a crucial role, the assumption may be made that the yttrium compounds
are usually isotypic with the erbium compounds. Due to some reported polymorphy,
e. g., in [155], I will only focus on the structures at ambient temperature and pressure.
The fluorides LaOF through ErOF adopt the crystal structure of NdOF, those from
TmOF through LuOF adopt the baddeleyite structure type of ZrO2
. In the NdOF structure
type according to Figure 6.12, double layers of oxygen and fluorine atoms form a cubic
close packing c. The neodymium atoms occupy all octahedral voids between adjacent
layers of oxygen and fluorine while the voids between two neighboring layers of the
same anions remain empty. This enables a shrinking of the interlayer distance here and
allows for the coordination of the neodymium atoms in the slightly compressed octahe￾dral voids by two further atoms of the next, but one layer. Thus, an eightfold coordina￾tion is achieved where the two further atoms cap opposite triangular faces. Regarding
structure systematics, this structure is strongly related to that of CdCl2
(Appendix D).
The baddeleyite structure type is a distorted variant of the fluorite structure (Fig￾ure 6.1). Here, the lanthanide atoms are coordinated by four oxygen and three halogen
atoms as depicted in Figure 6.12.
Figure 6.12: Crystal structures of NdOF, YbOCl (SmSI type) and YbOF (baddeleyite type); metal atoms grey,
the halide and the oxygen atoms green and red; for NdOF and YbOCl, the halide layers are indicated by A, B
and C; data: [156, 158, 159].68 � 6 Basic Compound Classes
The chlorides LaOCl through HoOCl and YOCl crystallize in the PbFCl structure (mat￾lockite) with oxygen replacing fluorine and the rare-earth elements replacing lead. The
remaining ErOCl, TmOCl, YbOCl and LuOCl adopt the SmSI structure. The NdOCl struc￾ture (PbFCl type) is displayed in Figure 6.13 and is derived from rutile in the same man￾ner as PbCl2
from the α-PbO2
structure. For further details, see Appendix D. In both
structures, the hexagonal close packing of anions achieves ninefold-coordinated voids
by formal fusion of two adjacent octahedral voids. Mixed oxygen-chlorine layers (red
and green) form the h packing in NdOCl where neodymium is coordinated by five chlo￾rine and four oxygen atoms.
The SmSI structure type is closely related to the previously elucidated NdOF type.
Here, the sequence of double layers chalcogenide and halide switches from c to hhcc
(Figure 6.12). Remember that a layer, which has the same adjacent layers is named h and
a layer with two different neighboring layers, is named c. The occupation of octahedral
voids of every second layer remains the same, but the change of the layer sequence
yields a sevenfold coordination as one of the two capping atoms above the opposite
triangular planes vanishes.
Figure 6.13: Crystal structures of NdOCl, PrOI, ScOBr and ScOI (top left to bottom right); metal atoms in
grey, the larger halide and the smaller oxygen atoms are in green and red according to the layers in a
hexagonal close packing; the indicated distances illustrate the different distortion; data: [160–163].
For LaOBr through NdOBr the PbFCl structure with ninefold coordination of the
rare-earth atoms is found. As expected, from SmOBr through LuOBr and for all iodide
oxides, the PrOI structure type is adopted, which provides a lower coordination number.
This structure is a stretched variant of the PbFCl type so that one out of three capping
atoms gets out of reach, and an eightfold coordination is achieved (Figure 6.13). This
stretched distortion is quantified by the ratio of the indicated analogous distances within
the green h layers of NdOCl and PrOI.
ScOF behaves like LuOF. For ScOBr, experimentally the FeOCl structure type was
found, which is also the most stable according to calculations; the same holds for ScOCl6.2 Binary Halides and Halide Oxides � 69
[155, 164]. The ScOBr structure is shown in Figure 6.13 and consists of a hexagonal close
packed structure of oxygen and chlorine atoms similar but not identical to that of PbFCl.
The h layers are indicated in red and green. The grey scandium atoms reside in half of
the octahedral voids so that chains of edge sharing octahedra result. A distorted vari￾ant of ScOBr based on a packing of mixed h layers of oxygen and iodine is found in
ScOI where the scandium atoms enter the layers as discussed above for lead atoms in
PbFCl and PbCl2
. Thus, for the scandium atoms a sevenfold coordination is achieved
(Figure 6.13). Regarding the cerium compounds, it was only reported that CeOF crystal￾lizes in the fluorite type and CeOCl analogously to LaOCl in the PbFCl type. This can be
extrapolated also for CeOBr, and for CeOI; thus, the PrOI structure can be assumed.
Among the ROX several structures with a layered ordering of the anions of differ￾ent sizes and charges are observed, such as the NdOF, PbFCl and PrOI structure types.
Bärnighausen35 noted that throughout the ROX series with PbFCl structure the close dis￾tances R–O are shorter and the close R–X distances are longer than the sum of ionic
radii; moreover, the X–X distances are smaller than the sum of their ionic radii, and the
anions overlap. Therefore, he inferred interactions between the halogen atoms [153].
These trends also hold for the averaged distances within the coordination of the R3+. Em￾ploying the revised ionic radii of 1976 [50], this also applies for the other structure types
mentioned above as depicted in Figure 6.14 where also the interatomic X–X distances
are shown. For each structure type, the respective ionic radii specific for the differing
coordination numbers were used. The same behavior as observed by Bärnighausen is
found for the similar structure type of PrOI, although to a lesser extent. This seems rea￾sonable since the PrOI structure type is a stretched variant of the PbFCl type. In both
cases, the overlap increases going from the harder to the softer anion—in absolute fig￾ures and relatively. Considering the NdOF type, there is no indication for an overlap of
the hard fluorine atoms as the F–F distances are in all cases larger than the sum of the
van der Waals radii. Also here, the doubly charged oxide ions are somewhat closer to the
R
3+ than expected, the singly charged fluoride ions somewhat further away. One might
assume electrostatic reasons for this trend.

interatomic distances A–B (ions A and B) and the

6.3 Oxides
The oxides reflect the different stabilities of the oxidation states of the rare-earth ele￾ments. Accordingly, monoxides, sesquioxides R2O3
and dioxides RO2
have been identi￾fied as the most stable ones discussed here. For elements like praseodymium and ter￾bium, intermediate oxides between the latter two are found as a stable form indicating
a broad phase width. The sesquioxides especially feature very high melting points be￾tween 2200 and 2500 °C, and CeO2 melts around 2480 °C. Because of the higher lattice en￾ergy, these are significantly higher compared with the trifluorides ranging from roughly
1100 through 1550 °C. The boiling points of the Ln2O3
increase continuously from about
3620 °C for La2O3
to 3980 °C for Lu2O3
passing an intermediate maximum of 4070 °C for
the ytterbium compound. Further details on the oxides and their properties, which are
not treated in this chapter, may be studied in [165–167].
6.3.1 The Sesquioxides R2O3
and Mixed III/IV-Oxides
The sesquioxide—the rare earth—is for most of the rare-earth elements the most stable
oxide. Thus, these are obtained during the industrial separation process as a first clean
product from the hydroxides. Also, the sesquioxides form by simple reaction of the pure
metals with air—except those of cerium, praseodymium and terbium; these can be ob￾tained under a hydrogen atmosphere from the first oxidation product. Most easily, those
oxides are obtained by smooth decomposition around 1000 °C of the respective hydrox￾ides, carbonates, nitrates or oxalates as precursors, which are readily available [166]. As
discussed in the previous chapter, thermal decomposition of the halide hydrates yields
primarily halide oxides, but also finally the oxides. For the sesquioxides not less than
five crystalline polymorphic forms, enumerated C to A, H and X, have been identified
so far for ambient pressure and between room temperature and the respective melting
points. An overview on the phase diagram for the lanthanide sesquioxides is given in
Figure 6.15.
For the large lanthanide ions, the trigonal A type structure shown in Figure 6.16 is
dominating. Here, two approaches to describe the crystal structure are used in litera￾ture. The first considers the lanthanide atoms as forming an almost undistorted hexag￾onal close packing of two layers indicated in blue and green. Red oxygen atoms occupy
alternating layers of octahedral and tetrahedral voids. Thereby half of the octahedral
and tetrahedral voids are occupied (Appendix D). Thus, the lanthanide atoms feature
a sevenfold coordination, essentially a defect cube-like surrounding with one oxygen
atom missing. The second, more classic approach, considers a packing of the anions. A
distorted primitive cubic packing of oxygen atoms hosts the lanthanide atoms in two￾thirds of all cubic voids, the latter being off-center to achieve a reduced coordination
number of seven. This surrounding may be described as a monocapped octahedron.
The first description may be more comprehensible; the latter one better illustrates the6.3 Oxides � 71

diagram of the poly￾morphs A, B, C, H and X

relationship to the thermodynamically neighbored phases as these are derived from the
fluorite structure as shown in Figure 6.1.
The hexagonal H type structure is the high-temperature polymorph of the A type.
Therein the oxygen atoms are disordered over all tetrahedral and octahedral voids of
the A type structure. At even a higher temperature, the X polymorph was reported to fea￾ture a body centered cubic arrangement of the rare-earth ions where the oxygen atoms
are disordered over all octahedral voids, which in this case, are slightly compressed
octahedra. These voids are half-occupied since six voids and two rare-earth atoms are
present per unit cell.
In the monoclinic B-type structure of Sm2O3
, depicted in Figure 6.16, the oxygen
atoms form a distorted hexagonal close packing with two-thirds of the octahedral voids
being filled with samarium atoms [172]. The corrugated h layers show a tiny relative
shift so the octahedral voids in this packing approach a prismatic appearance. While
one out of the three different samarium atoms is indeed octahedrally coordinated, the
other two experience a sevenfold, single-capped trigonal prismatic coordination sphere
caused by the distortion of the close packed layers. These coordination numbers were
also confirmed by MAPLE calculations (see the info in Chapter 6.1.1 and Appendix F.3).
The C-type structure, also known as the bixbyite type, crystallizes cubically and de￾rives from the well-known fluorite type structure by a 2 × 2 × 2 superstructure yielding
a basic composition R32O64. To achieve the R:O = 2:3 ratio, ordered vacancies ◻ forming
rows of empty tetrahedral voids along the unit cell’s space diagonals are present accord￾ing to R32O48◻16. These vacancies reduce the coordination number of eight in fluorite to
six causing a slight distortion of the whole structure with respect to the aristotype. Fig￾ure 6.16 displays a virtual face centered unit cell not identical with the real one. This
representation simplifies the derivation from the fluorite type; the voids are indicated
by different colored anions.72 � 6 Basic Compound Classes

layers of oxygen red and blue, Sm grey) and C (dotted yellow lines indicate a unit cell analogous to that of
fluorite, vacant positions in blue, oxygen atoms red); data: [168–171].
The decreasing coordination numbers from A via B to the C-type suggest that the
decreasing ionic radii are the main origin of the phase stability reflected in Figure 6.15.
In this context, the not yet mentioned oxides Sc2O3
and Y2O3 fit very well; both adopt
the C-type structure, which apparently correlates with their respective ionic radii com￾parable with that of erbium (Y) or the smallest of all rare-earth elements (Sc) and the
according preference for a smaller coordination number.
6.3.2 Syntheses and Structures of the Dioxides and Intermediate Oxides
The dioxides RO2
have been described for all rare-earth elements, which tend to form
tetravalent ions; these are cerium, praseodymium and terbium. For these three, numer￾ous phases between R2O3
and RO2
are mentioned and discussed; out of this series the
most important are bright yellow CeO2-x, brown PrO1.8±x
(“Pr6O11”) and deeply brown
TbO1.7±x
(“Tb7O12” or “Tb4O7
”) since they are usually obtained by simple oxidation of
the pure metals in air. They are subject to considerable phase widths indicated by x.
With increasing deviation from the composition RO2
, the oxides show intense coloring.
These colors are due to charge-transfer transitions, which are the subject of Chapter 8.2.
Charge-transfer transitions occur between oxide anions and Ln4+ as LMCT or as interva￾lence charge-transfer transitions (IVCT) between Ln4+ and Ln3+. To get pure dioxides, the
syntheses have to be conducted under a pure oxygen atmosphere for CeO2
at ambient
pressure, and in the case of PrO2
and TbO2
under high oxygen pressures.6.3 Oxides � 73
Numerous crystal structure analyses illustrate the demand for more knowledge in
these phase diagrams, to find more distinct phases—several of which have been claimed
to exist. All of these apparently represent flat thermodynamic minima reflected in the
broad phase widths. The structures derive from the fluorite type adopted by all dioxides;
this can either be described as a face centered cubic close packing of cations with almost
all tetrahedral voids filled with oxygen or—the anion packing related approach—as a
primitive cubic packing of oxygen with the metal atoms in every second cubic void.
Here, I prefer the former description. Anyway, the tetravalent ions thus are seven or
eightfold coordinated, which is somewhat surprising regarding their size that decreases
in the row Ce4+, Pr4+, Tb4+ and nicely reflecting their thermal stability or difficulty to be
synthesized at all.
Pr6O11 and Tb7O12
Both structures, albeit crystallizing in different crystal systems with very different unit
cells, derive from the fluorite type structure discussed earlier in this chapter (Figure 6.1
and Appendix D). Therefore, in Figure 6.17 the fluorite type unit cells are illustrated by
thin orange lines. The black spheres represent ordered defect sites within the packing
of red oxygen atoms. Further, the actual unit cells of both structures are also shown.
For monoclinic Pr6O11, three fluorite type unit cells based on oxygen and praseo￾dymium (blue) are shown. Without defects, these three unit cells represent 3 × 4 = 12
praseodymium and 3 × 8 = 24 oxygen atoms. Since there are two oxygen defects (black
spheres), the overall composition Pr12O22 or Pr6O11 is achieved. A similar game may
be played with rhombohedral Tb7O12 where at least seven fluorite type unit cells are
Figure 6.17: Structures of Pr6O11 and Tb7O12. The oxygen atoms are shown as small red spheres. The oxy￾gen defects as large black spheres. The rare-earth atoms as larger blue, green and red spheres; for Tb7O12,

needed. Thus, 7 × 4 = 28 terbium and 7 × 8 − 8 = 48 oxygen atoms are displayed, which
fits with four formula units of Tb7O12. Moreover, in Figure 6.17 the terbium layers of the
slightly distorted cubic close packing are indicated in different colors.
6.3.3 A Closer Look On CeO2
For several reasons, cerium dioxide is a highly interesting oxide. Some of the most
promising applications will be roughly discussed; for further reading, [175] is recom￾mended. The phase diagram of the system Ce2O3
–CeO2
is well known [176]. Interestingly,
we will come across the two compositions discussed just before. If CeO2
is heated to tem￾peratures above 680 °C under reduced oxygen pressure, the α-phase CeO2-x
forms. This
phase adopts the cubic fluorite type with randomly distributed oxygen defects. Its typical
phase width is indicated by x ranging between 0 and 0.29. Prolonged tempering leads to
an ordering of the oxygen defects. Important phases formed are the β-phase, i. e., CeO1.83
= Ce6O11, a rhombohedral phase, i. e., CeO1.71 = Ce7O12, both of which are isostructural
to the intermediate oxides of praseodymium and terbium described above. A further
phase is the triclinic δ-phase Ce11O20 (CeO1.82). This last example illustrates how many
ordered phases may be found in this regime below 680 °C.
Further reduction, e. g., by hydrogen, yields the σ and θ-phases between x = 0.29
and x = 0.5 [177]. The σ-phase is a padded variant of the C-type structure Ce2O3+y
, the
θ-phase forms at compositions closer to Ce2O3
and adopts the A-type structure of the
sesquioxide. While the latter is stable against reoxidation with oxygen at room tem￾perature, the former is not and yields Ce7O12 again. Any reduction of CeO2
leads to an
increase of the inner surface, which makes such materials interesting for catalysis.
Oxygen Storage
An obvious capability of the phases between Ce2O3
and CeO2
is the uptake and release of
oxygen with increasing and decreasing oxygen partial pressure, respectively. A typical
equilibrium
2 Ce2O3 + O2
400°C
󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀⇀ ↽󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀 4 CeO2
(6.20)
operates around 400 °C. The oxygen storage capacity becomes even better in the pres￾ence of smaller cations such as Zr4+
.
40 Since ZrO2
forms a tetragonal phase strongly re￾lated to fluorite when doped with rare-earth ions, solid solutions are easily obtained in
the full regime ZrO2
–CeO2
. The same holds for Ce2O3 where a doping with Zr4+ results

in a stabilization of the fluorite type with random distribution of oxygen defects [178].
Moreover, since Ce3+ ions are significantly larger than Ce4+, a relevant amount of Zr4+
ions inhibits the necessary expansion of the lattice, and thus the reduction.
The fluorite type and its related tetragonal phase provide numerous empty voids,
such as the octahedral voids and with increasing reduction of Ce4+ tetrahedral voids.
These voids allow for a high mobility of oxygen, and ZrO2
is famous for its excellent
oxygen conductivity at elevated temperatures. In such materials, an ion which features
fairly stable adjacent oxidation states enables oxygen storage. It can further act as an
oxygen pressure buffer as it is oxidized under high oxygen partial pressures—leading to
an uptake of oxygen into the bulk structure—and vice versa. Right at the middle between
ZrO2
and CeO2
a mild reduction yields the quite stable pyrochlore phase Ce2
Zr2O7
, which
also may be reoxidized under mild conditions [179].
Besides these more or less structural effects promoting the oxygen storage capacity,
electronic effects can also further increase the capacity. For instance, supported plat￾inum metals on the surface apparently provide low lying unoccupied states within the
band gap. Here, the electrons formed during the release of oxygen via
2 O2−
󳨀󳨀󳨀→ O2 + 4 e−
(6.21)
can be consumed. Without supported platinum metals, the only option of the surplus
electrons is to reduce Ce4+ to Ce3+. This requires more energy as these states lie above
the band gap as the lowest lying of the conduction band [180]. Consequently, the oxygen
release occurs preferentially in the direct neighborhood of the supported metal. Thus,
the deposition of respective metals fosters the entire process in both directions. Accord￾ingly, the oxygen storage capacity is enhanced by several orders of magnitude and the
kinetics are accelerated—and the material can be employed as an oxygen buffer in catal￾ysis.
Catalysis
The interplay of such oxygen buffering and the phenomenon of comparable stability of
adjacent oxidation states like Ce3+/Ce4+ fulfills important preconditions for catalytic ap￾plications. So, among a series of other processes Ce1-x
ZrxO2
catalyzes the oxidation of SO2
during the production of sulphuric acid, analogously to the common catalyst V2O4
/V2O5
employed in the contact process.
Another very important application of supported solid solutions like Ce0.76Zr0.24O2
happens in the so-called three-way catalytic converters to clean fossil car exhausts from
toxic gases and pollutants. Here, three different reactions are triggered. One reaction is
the oxidation of surplus fuel according to the schematic reaction
2 C8H18 + 25 O2 󳨀󳨀󳨀→ 16 CO2 + 18 H2O, (6.22)
and the second is the oxidation of toxic carbon monoxide via76 � 6 Basic Compound Classes
2 CO + O2 󳨀󳨀󳨀→ 2 CO2
. (6.23)
In this context, CO molecules are presumably caught by the supported platinum metal
and subsequently oxidized by oxygen of the CeO2
, which is released more easily in the
direct neighborhood as discussed above. The third reaction is the reduction of toxic ni￾trous gases such as
2 NO + 2 CO 󳨀󳨀󳨀→ N2 + 2 CO2
(6.24)
also catalyzed in the presence of platinum metals, presumably in a similar way. The chal￾lenge in this approach is that reactions 6.22 and 6.23 demand high oxygen to fuel ratios
for an efficient conversion as in both oxygen is required while reaction 6.24 needs the
reduction agent carbon monoxide, which is only present at low oxygen to fuel ratios. To
maintain this ratio in the optimal regime, an excellent oxygen buffer is necessary—like
Ce0.76Zr0.24O, which is by far better than the initially employed alumina. Furthermore,
ceria catalyzes the oxidation of soot, that is normally poison for catalysts and which is
significantly more relevant in exhausts from diesel engines [175].
6.3.4 The Monoxides and Eu3O4
After we shed some light on the oxides of rare-earth elements capable to form tetrava￾lent ions, and thus mixed R(III/IV) or even pure R(IV) oxides, here we turn our attention
to those being able to form comparably stable divalent ions R2+ like europium and ytter￾bium. The monoxides of the latter two are obtained as dark red powders either under
strictly reducing conditions or reacting the pure metals with the sesquioxides under in￾ert conditions. Both semiconductors crystallize in the rock salt structure type (for the
structure details, see Figure 6.20 Appendix D). It should be noted that only EuO was ob￾tained as a phase pure powder in larger quantities so far. A facile synthesis starts from
excess lithium hydride and an europium halide oxide, with chloride as halide of choice.
This yields via the reaction
2 EuOCl + 2 LiH 600–800 °C
󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀󳨀→ vacuum
2 EuO + 2 LiCl(g) + H2
(g) (6.25)
almost black europium monoxide EuO since the lithium halide sublimes [181]. This re￾action also works with the bromide and iodide but not with the fluoride. Because of the
higher stability of EuOCl against humidity, this educt is preferred. The magnetic proper￾ties are discussed in Chapter 9.5. Under high pressure conditions, the metallic monoxides
from lanthanum to samarium can be synthesized; they are obtained as golden powders.
Only in the case of SmO, the metal is approaching the divalent state while in the re￾maining ones magnetic measurements indicate trivalent lanthanide atoms according to

Considering mixed valent oxides comprising Eu2+ and Eu3+, one might think of a
spinel analogue. And indeed in 1962, Bärnighausen35 and Brauer41 described a synthe￾sis around 900 °C, reacting EuO with Eu2O3
, and the orthorhombic structure of the dark
red Eu3O4
. It adopts the structure of CaFe2O4
, where divalent europium is coordinated
by a bicapped trigonal prism; both sites of trivalent europium are coordinated octahe￾drally as displayed in Figure 6.18 [185, 186, 181]. This structure can be understood by
multiple chemical twinning not discussed here [123]. Its phase width is rather narrow
and it forms solid solutions with either EuO or Eu2O3
. Around 5 K, it shows antiferro￾magnetic ordering; the recorded effective magnetic moment of 5.3 μB agrees well with a
ratio of 1:2 of ordered Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions in the structure [187].
6.3.5 The Superconducting Oxides La2-x
Bax
CuO4
And YBa2
Cu3O7-x
Because of their extraordinary superconducting properties, two further oxides are men￾tioned in this chapter—although they are not binary ones. In a superconducting state,
an electrically conducting material shows no resistance anymore below a critical tem￾perature Tc
. Until 1986, the highest Tc ≈ 23 K was known for Nb3Ge. Thus, up to then,
liquid helium or hydrogen were required for cooling to achieve superconductivity. In
1986, Bednorz42 and Müller43 discovered the first ceramic superconductors. The Tc of
the first described compound within the system La2-x
Bax
CuO4 was already around 35 K
for x = 0.15 [188]. Shortly thereafter, for YBa2
Cu3O7-x
critical temperatures up to 92 K
were reported for x = 0.07 [189]. Now, also at a liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 K, su￾perconductivity could be achieved. Until now, the application is inhibited as the ceramic
compounds are brittle, and thus it is challenging to produce wires. Quite recently, the

successful production of such a wire with a length of more than 300 km with a diameter
of 4 mm was reported [190].
A typical synthesis of YBa2
Cu3O7-x
starts from the carbonates or nitrates of yttrium,
barium and copper around 1000 °C. La2-x
Bax
CuO4 was obtained by coprecipitation of the
aqueous solutions of the nitrates of lanthanum, barium and copper employing oxalic
acid and heating the product to 900 °C [188].
The crystal structure of YBa2
Cu3O7-x
is derived from a threefold superstructure
of the perovskite type. Here, ordered oxygen-vacancies are found; even more vacan￾cies emerge increasing x from zero to one (Figure 6.18). These further vacancies alter
the local surrounding of the copper atoms by oxygen. The copper atoms show either
a square-planar or a linear coordination while the square-pyramidal environment of
the other copper atoms remains intact. In YBa2
Cu3O7-x
, the yttrium atoms experience
a cubic coordination. In contrast to the yttrium compound in La2-x
Bax
CuO4
, all copper
atoms feature the same Jahn–Teller distorted elongated octahedral coordination. The
lanthanum atoms share the site with barium atoms, and thus both are surrounded
by nine oxygen atoms in a monocapped square antiprismatic fashion according to
Figure 6.18. While in YBa2
Cu3O7-x
, the electron concentration is driven by the oxygen
content in La2-x
Bax
CuO4
; this is controlled by the lanthanum-barium ratio.
6.4 Borides, Carbides, Nitrides and Sulfides
Selected further binary compounds of the rare-earth elements with main group ele￾ments will be considered in this section. In each group, there are numerous representa￾tives, many with highly interesting properties. For closer looks on these, I recommend
[191–198] for further reading.
6.4.1 Borides
Borides are usually obtained by direct reactions of the rare-earth elements or their ox￾ides with boron at temperatures beyond 1800 °C. They show high melting points and a
remarkable stability against acids and bases. Here, I will focus on two compounds, the
binary RB6
and the ternary boride Nd2
Fe14B.
Among the RB6
, the europium and ytterbium compounds are isolators according
to a configuration R2+(B6
)
2 – while the others feature metallic behavior according to
La3+(B6
)

. The latter are excellent thermal emitters of electrons or hot cathodes be￾cause of their high melting points and low work functions, especially the lanthanum and
the cerium compounds. Moreover, the purple to violet LaB6
becomes superconducting
below 0.45 K [201]. Their crystal structure can be derived from the CsCl structure type,
where a primitive cubic packing of chlorine hosts caesium atoms in the cubic voids. In
RB6
the caesium atoms and chlorine are formally substituted by R atoms and B6

hedra as depicted in Figure 6.19. These octahedra are covalently bound to further six
octahedra, which form a 24-fold coordination of the rare-earth elements.
The second boride considered here is Nd2
Fe14B. It is a prominent material employed,
for instance, in wind turbines as permanent magnets. Its magnetic properties will be
discussed in Chapter 9.6.4. The development of this material in the 1980s was motivated
by quite expensive magnets comprised of samarium and cobalt. Nowadays, neodymium
has been classified as a critical element like praseodymium and dysprosium due to their
importance for the renewable energies sector. Nevertheless, the vast majority of wind
turbines do not employ permanent magnets, but are rather geared toward turbine tech￾nology [202]. The hard magnetic phase Nd2
Fe14B is usually synthesized by rapidly melt￾ing the elements under inert atmosphere in induction furnaces; then the obtained flakes
are milled under a hydrogen atmosphere. Here, brittle hydrogen containing Nd2
Fe14BHx
is formed, which can be ground very well to small particles. The preparation of the mag￾nets under a strong magnetic field has to be conducted carefully as it has considerable
impact on the magnetic properties of the final material. For instance, to get a permanent
magnet with a maximal energy density, the individual grains are sintered with a non￾magnetic phase while for a high remanence the contacts between the individual grains
necessarily have to be as close as possible. Further details regarding synthetic aspects
may be found in [203].
The crystal structure of Nd2
Fe14B depicted in Figure 6.19 is very complicated on a
first glance, but very interesting on a second and quite well comprehensible on a third.
For a better understanding, the relevant structure motifs are colored. Green and blue
iron atoms build two kagomé33 nets like those in LaNi5
(Figure 6.3). In Nd2
Fe14B, these
layers are corrugated. Within this kagomé double layer further (red) iron atoms are80 � 6 Basic Compound Classes
situated, which are additionally coordinated by two grey neodymium atoms. Between
the double layers planar layers containing the neodymium, further (green) iron and the
(yellow) boron atoms are found, which are vaguely reminiscent of layer B in LaNi5
. In
the full structure, the boron atoms occupy trigonal prismatic voids of iron atoms and
connect both double layers. Half of the neodymium atoms are coordinated by sixteen
iron, three neodymium and one boron atom, and the other half by sixteen iron, two
neodymium and two boron atoms.
6.4.2 Carbides and Nitrides
The nitrides predominantly form simple binary and high melting compounds RN with
rock salt structure; for the structure details, see the following info box and Figure 6.20.
The same structure is found for the binary phosphides RP. The nitrides are formed
around 1000 °C from the elements and develop ammonia upon hydrolysis due to the
high oxygen affinity of the rare-earth elements. Therefore, during synthesis, oxygen has
to be excluded carefully to avoid contamination. For some of them, in addition nitrogen
deficient phases were reported. The nitrides RN were all reported to be semiconduc￾tors with band gaps between 0.6 and 1.6 eV. The magnetic properties of GdN will be the
subject of Chapter 9.3.
Important crystal structure types no. 3–rock salt: The rock salt structure type, chemically NaCl, consists of a
cubic close packing of chloride ions; in all octahedral voids, sodium ions are situated (see also Chapter D).
Accordingly, the chloride ions are also octahedrally coordinated by sodium cations and vice versa. This
structure type is usually adopted by highly ionic compounds, and thus frequently found. In this book,
GdN and the europium monochalcogenides adopt this structure.

sodium atoms are grey, the chlorine atoms green and the unit cell
edges dark grey.
The Crystal Structure of Sm2
Co17N3
The crystal structure of Sm2
T17N3
(T = Fe, Co), depicted in Figure 6.21, is closely related
to that of SmCo5
, and this is isotypic with that of LaNi5
discussed in Chapter 6.1.2. Like
there, two different layers can be identified. Layer A forms also a kagomé33 net of nine
cobalt atoms. Layer B is slightly distorted, and half of all samarium atoms (grey) are6.4 Borides, Carbides, Nitrides and Sulfides � 81

substituted by cobalt dumbbells (yellow). Moreover, in layer B interstitial sites may be
occupied by nitrogen (blue). Thus, the composition of this layer amounts to Sm2
Co8N3
. In
the unit cell, the layers A and B alternate. The B layers follow a sequence αβγ, so do the
A layers. The shown structure of the nitride is essentially the same as Sm2
Co17, in the
nitride the unit cell expands within the a-b plane. In Sm2
Co17N3
, the samarium atoms
are coordinated by nineteen cobalt and three nitrogen atoms. In the intermetallic phase
Sm2
Co17, it is accordingly only coordinated by nineteen cobalt atoms. For the sake of
completeness, the coordination of the cobalt atoms in Sm2
Co17N3
should also at least be
mentioned. The four chemically different cobalt atoms are coordinated by ten cobalt and
two rare-earth atoms (Co1), by a nitrogen, ten cobalt and two rare-earth atoms (Co2), by
a nitrogen, nine cobalt and three rare-earth atoms (Co3) and finally the dumbbell cobalt
atoms are coordinated by thirteen cobalt atoms and a rare-earth atom (Co4).
The Carbides R3
C, R2
C3
and R4
C3
Regarding the carbides, many stoichiometries were reported. Besides the acetylides, in￾tercalation compounds into graphene like EuC6
or metal rich carbides were also re￾ported, such as Sc4
C3
or R3
C (R = Sm…Lu, Y). With increasing carbon content, the ma￾terials tend to very high melting points well above 2000 °C.
In the crystal structure of LaC2
, the lanthanum atoms build a tetragonally distorted
body-centered cubic packing. The reason for this distortion—essentially an elongation
along one axis—are the acetylide ions C2 –
2
. These dumbbells occupy one-third of the
pseudo-octahedral voids as shown in Figure 6.22. These voids were already discussed
and shown in Figure 6.16 on the example of the X-type Nd2O3 where all of these voids
are partially occupied. Here, the lanthanum atoms are coordinated tenfold by carbon;
the structure type is that of CaC2
. The structure of Y2
C3
adopts the structure type of Pu2
C3
and also features C2
dumbbells. As depicted in Figure 6.22, the structure of Y2
C3
can be
derived from an even stronger distorted body-centered cubic packing of yttrium atoms
indicated by the broken blue lines. In such packings, eight atoms form lengthy bisdisphe￾noid voids colored yellow. These voids host the C2 –
2
ions. The yttrium atoms are coordi￾nated ninefold by carbon.82 � 6 Basic Compound Classes

A series of carbides containing C2
dumbbells shows superconductivity. Interest￾ingly, the transition temperature Tc
seems related to the carbon-carbon bond length.
The closer to 130 pm, the higher Tc
; apparently, an optimum occupation of the antibond￾ing σ

states of the carbon-carbon bond plays a role here. The maximum is achieved for
Y2
C3
(Tc = 15 K, 129.8 pm), for La2
C3
Tc = 13 K (129.4 pm), YC2
Tc = 4.0 K (127.1 pm) and
LaC2
Tc = 1.6 K (127.5 pm) were reported [205].
6.4.3 Sulfides
Sulfide is clearly softer than oxide, which fits better for the hard rare-earth ions. Hence,
the sulfides are easily subject to hydrolysis and the syntheses are achieved best react￾ing the elements, possibly by an assistant flux. Essentially, the sulfides adopt the stoi￾chiometries already seen in the oxide section. Thus, for all rare-earth elements except
europium the sulfides R2
S3
are known. The structure systematics follow a similar trend
from higher coordination numbers up to eight for lanthanum to lower coordination
numbers of six for the lutetium compound. Moreover, sulfide is chemically more on the
reducing side than the lighter chalcogenide oxide. For instance, paramagnetic CeS2
does
not contain tetravalent cerium like diamagnetic CeO2
but trivalent ions and mixed va￾lent sulfur according to (Ce3+)
2
(S2 – )
2
(S2 –
2
). This reducing side becomes obvious when
considering the compositions RS and R3
S4
. The rare-earth elements europium, ytter￾bium and samarium show a certain tendency to the divalent state. Accordingly, these in￾deed form semiconducting monosulfides R2+(X2 – ) while the other elements form metal￾lic monosulfides R3+(X2 – ) ⋅ e
–
. This can already be seen by the unit cell volumes of the
structures isotypic with rock salt as they are considerably larger for Eu2+, Yb2+ and Sm2+
compared with the trivalent ones. Semiconducting black SmS converts under slight pres￾sure into metallic golden SmS containing the smaller Sm3+; and by heating, it transforms
back to the semiconducting form. Therefore, SmS is interesting for several applications
such as data storage or infrared sensor [207]. Eu3
S4
shows an interesting phase transi￾tion around −70 °C, below of which an ordering of Eu2+ and Eu3+ occurs. At room tem￾perature, the valences fluctuate and a structure closely related to that of Y2

is found; here, europium replaces the C2
dumbbells and sulfur the yttrium atoms iso￾typic with the Th3
P4
structure type [208]. Despite this report, there seem to still be some
doubts about the existence of Eu2
S3
[209, 210]. Further, also several polysulfides were
reviewed [197].
6.5 Silicates And Selected Silicate-Analogous Compounds
Silicates are the most abundant class of minerals on earth and, therefore, also the sili￾cates of the rare-earth elements are worth a closer look. Moreover, in the second part
of this book, I chose several silicate-analogous compounds to act as examples for optical
and magnetic properties. Silicate-analogous compounds in this sense contain tetrahe￾dral building units centered by nonmetals like boron, silicon, phosphorus or sulfur and
terminated by nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine atoms. After a short classification, the struc￾tures of ternary rare-earth silicates will be discussed before the examples of silicate￾analogous compounds relevant to this book will be addressed. Among these compounds
are also host structures of phosphors discussed later. These occasionally do not contain
rare-earth elements but ions, which enable the doping with rare-earth ions. This will be
indicated in the respective cases.
The main reason that silicates and silicate-analogous compounds are of interest also
for this book is that they feature tetrahedra as basic building units. Tetrahedra do not
have an inversion center, and thus structures become more probable lacking an inver￾sion center or at least the sites on which the rare-earth ions reside have a good chance
to be non-centrosymmetric. This is beneficial for the efficiency of optical transitions,
which will be discussed in the second part. Silicates are classified according to the con￾densation degree of the tetrahedra and the resulting dimensionality of the anion. Classes
of silicates and analogous materials are nesosilicates, i. e., silicates containing noncon￾densed SiO4
tetrahedra, and sorosilicates, group silicates where tetrahedra form finite
moieties. Further classes are chain silicates (inosilicates), cyclosilicates, phyllosilicates
comprised of anionic layers and three-dimensional frameworks, i. e., tectosilicates.
6.5.1 Coordination Strength
Especially for the optical properties, the crystal chemistry of the local coordination of the
rare-earth ions is relevant. The coordination strength of a ligand has two components—
electrostatic and covalent interactions.
In order to roughly estimate the electrostatic coordination strength of the terminal
atoms of such anions in this book, the effective coordination charge cX of an ion X is
introduced based on Pauling’s rules for ionic crystal structures. Pauling23 defined the
electrostatic coordination strength of an ion i84 � 6 Basic Compound Classes
si =
zi
ki
(6.26)
with its charge zi and coordination number ki
[220]. For the charge of an ion j holds
zj ≈ −
kj
∑
i=1
si
(6.27)
that its charge approximately equals the sum of coordination strengths of all surround￾ing oppositely charged ions. Therefore, the effective coordination charge cX
is the re￾maining charge on a terminal ion Xztheo – with its charge ztheo partially balanced by n
neighboring ions
cx = ztheo −
n
∑
i=1
si
(6.28)
and acting on a metal ion coordinated by this anion. In case of a silicate anion SiO4 –
4
featuring a fourfold-coordinated Si4+ ion sSi equals 1. For any terminal oxide ion then
holds
cO
2− = 2 − 1 = 1.
Besides this electrostatic influence, the covalent coordination strength plays an even
larger role for ions like Ce3+ or Eu2+. To estimate the covalency of a bond, Pauling also
derived a formula based on the electronegativities of both atoms [46]. According to
p = 1 − e
−
1

(Δχ)
2
(6.29)
the polarity of a bond, p decreases, i. e., the covalency increases, with a decreasing dif￾ference of electronegativities Δχ. For instance, the interaction between a R3+ ion and
halides shows increasing covalency, i. e., nephelauxetic effect, going from fluorine to io￾dine. The coordination strengths will be discussed in this chapter briefly. For further
details of the nephelauxetic effect, see Chapter 8.1.
6.5.2 Silicates
Chemically spoken, R3+ ions are quite hard and, therefore, prefer hard anions. Con￾sidering the previous considerations, the hardness of silicate anions decreases with
an increasing condensation degree, because then the charge per volume ratio de￾creases. Thus, naturally occurring rare-earth elements have a strong preference for
low-condensed neso and sorosilicates. The noncondensed anions will be enclosed in
round parentheses, and condensed anions in square parentheses.6.5 Silicates And Selected Silicate-Analogous Compounds � 85
Considering first the nesosilicates, cerium and europium adopt their special roles
as Ce4+ and Eu2+. While in Eu2
(SiO4
) divalent europium ions experience a nine and ten￾fold coordination, tetravalent cerium ions get a square antiprismatic coordination in
Ce(SiO4
). Ce(SiO4
) crystallizes in the zircon structure, which can be nicely related to that
of rutile as shown in Figure 6.23. The 6+6-coordination of two adjacent octahedra in ru￾tile evolves into a 8+4-coordination in the zircon type [123]. To a certain extent, natural
zircon also hosts the other trivalent rare-earth elements. Titanite, another nesosilicate
of the typical composition CaTi(SiO4
)X (X = O, F, OH) also contains significant amounts
of rare-earth elements; the smaller R3+ find a sevenfold coordination here (Figure 4.2).
The trivalent ions form the nesosilicate oxide R2O(SiO4
) for the whole series R = La…Lu;
on display in Figure 6.23 is the gadolinium compound. Here, the rare-earth ions are sur￾Figure 6.23: Structures of (a) Eu2

rounded by seven oxygen atoms. The larger rare-earth ions from lanthanum through
gadolinium also adopt the famous apatite type structure. However, the fourteen nega￾tive charges of the anions in R4.67(SiO4
)
3O require a significantly reduced occupation of
trivalent rare-earth ions or mixed occupation with other lower charged cations on the
sites hosting the five cations to achieve charge balance. Another important silicate min￾eral is cerite, (R,Ca)9

, where the silicate tetrahedra form close
packed layers. This is shown in Figure 4.2.
The sorosilicates are also depicted in Figure 6.23. R2
[Si2O7
] for R = Sc, La…Lu is
the most important scandium silicate and scandium mineral thortveitite. There the
rare-earth ions are sixfold coordinated, and accordingly this structure is best suited
for the smaller R3+. Under high pressure, the coordination number rises to seven like
in the example of Lu2
[Si2O7
], shown in Figure 6.23(l). The final two sorosilicates in this
chapter comprise two different anions. Besides a noncondensed SiO4
tetrahedron in
Ho4
[Si3O10](SiO4
) a condensed ensemble of three and in La6
[Si4O13](SiO4

an ensem￾ble of four tetrahedra were reported. The chemically similar natural mineral allanite,
namely CaR(Al2
,Fe2+)[Si2O7
][SiO4
]O(OH), features distinct disilicate and orthosilicate
moieties and hosts preferentially larger rare-earth ions feeling well in an elevenfold
coordination as depicted in Figure 4.2.
Gadolinite is a mineral comprised of silicate-analogous layers. In these layers, sil￾icate tetrahedra alternate with boron or beryllium centered ones, so that it formally
might be classified as a nesosilicate. Because of the similarity of boron and beryllium
based networks, gadolinite is indeed a phyllosilicate-analogous compound. This coin￾cides with a typical composition (R,Ca)2
Fe2
[(B,Be)2
Si2O10] and a ratio of tetrahedral cen￾ters to oxygen of 4:10. As stated above, the higher condensed silicates are chemically
softer and should therefore host the preferable larger rare-earth ions. This is indeed the
case (Table 1.1).
6.5.3 Aluminates
Anions in aluminates comprise trivalent aluminium ions coordinated by oxide either
tetrahedrally like in silicates or octahedrally. The effective coordination charge is gen￾erally higher in aluminates according to
cO-Al = 2 −

4
= 1.25 (c. n. = 4), cO-Al = 2 −
3
6
= 1.5 (c. n. = 6) (6.30)
Moreover, also the covalency of the interactions between terminal oxygen atoms and
metal atoms is stronger in aluminates as the aluminium atoms in the coordination
sphere of oxygen reduces their electronegativity. Thus aluminates show a stronger
coordination than silicates.

prehended by considering rods comprising alternating occupied octahedra and empty
prisms. These rods align along the space diagonals of the unit cell. The resulting rod
packing is shown in 6.24(c). In YAG, the aluminium atoms Al[o] are octahedrally, the
atoms Al[t] are tetrahedrally coordinated and the yttrium atoms feature a slightly dis￾torted cubic coordination. If YAG is doped with rare-earth ions, this solely occurs on the
yttrium site. Since the AlO4
tetrahedra are not condensed to others, YAG is a nesosilicate
analogous aluminate.
The structure of the tectosilicate analogous strontium aluminate Sr[Al2O4
] can be
understood as a stuffed tridymite type, a SiO2
polymorph, where the aluminium atoms
replace silicon. In Sr[Al2O4
], sechserrings of AlO4
tetrahedra provide large cavities to
host the strontium atoms, which are further connected perpendicular to the ring layer to
build a three-dimensional framework. The Sr2+ atoms, which are replaced upon doping
by Eu2+ and R3+, are surrounded by eight and seven oxygen atoms forming irregular
coordination polyhedra as depicted in Figure 6.24. Above 650 °C, a higher symmetric
high-temperature polymorph is known.
La[MgAl11O19] and Ba[MgAl10O17] (BAM) are magnesium aluminates, which are de￾rived from β-alumina. A typical synthesis is conducted according to

structures feature motifs of the spinel structure with the magnesium ions having a pref-88 � 6 Basic Compound Classes

erence for the tetrahedral voids. In La[MgAl11O19], the rare-earth ions are coordinated
by twelve, and the barium atoms in Ba[MgAl10O17] only by nine oxygen atoms. Both
structures are important host structures for lanthanide ions, which are doped on the
lanthanum and barium sites, respectively. The cerium compound doped with terbium,
i. e., Ce[MgAl11O19]:Tb3+ is known under the acronym CAT.
6.5.4 Nitridosilicates, Nitridoaluminates and Oxonitridosilicates
Nitridosilicates are silicate analogous compounds based on SiN4
tetrahedra (Figure 6.26).
This compound class was mainly developed over the last decades by Schnick44 and
opened up for rare-earth based phosphors. Nitrogen tends much more than oxygen
to bridge more than two tetrahedra in silicate analogous networks, and consequently
higher condensation degrees and denser structures are possible. Considering the coor￾dination strength nitrogen interacts more covalently than oxygen with metal atoms due
to its lower electronegativity. Furthermore, the effective coordination charge is gener￾ally higher in nitridosilicates according to
cN-Si = 3 −
4
4
= 2 (6.32)
because of the higher charge of N3 – . Thus, nitridosilicates show a significantly stronger
coordination than silicates and also aluminates. Further, in oxonitridosilicates mixed

coordination environments of O2 – and N3 – are found. This enables a certain tuning of
the coordination strength.
The barium nitridosilicate Ba[Si7N10] comprises a very dense three-dimensional,
and thus tectosilicate-analogous anionic framework, which hosts the barium atoms in
almost spherical spacious voids with an irregular thirteenfold coordination. This high
coordination number yields comparably large coordination distances. If doped with
smaller rare-earth ions like divalent europium ions, these presumably will experience
an overall fairly weak coordination strength. Sr2
[Si5N8
] is also tectosilicate-analogous
and provides two tenfold-coordinated sites for the strontium ions Sr2+, which may be
replaced with Eu2+ upon doping. One polyhedron is a four-capped trigonal antiprism,
the other a four-capped trigonal prism of nitrogen atoms (Figure 6.26). Such nitridosili￾cates are typically synthesized under oxygen and humidity-free conditions starting from
the so-called silicon diimide, a compound strongly related to SiO2
, which can be accessed
via

(6.34)
The reaction conditions are so reducing that it is no challenge to obtain doping with
divalent europium here. The oxonitridosilicate Eu[Si2O2N2
] is a phyllosilicate-analogous90 � 6 Basic Compound Classes
compound comprising dense layers of condensed SiON3
tetrahedra, which coordinate
the europium atoms sevenfold with six oxygen atoms forming a prism and a further
nitrogen atom as quite distant cap (Figure 6.26).
A further increase of the effective coordination charge is feasible by replacing
tetravalent silicon by trivalent aluminium in nitridosilicates according to
cN-Si = 3 −
3
4
= 2.25 (6.35)
yielding nitridoaluminates. The example here, also employed as a host structure for
phosphors, is the strontium lithium nitridoaluminate Sr[LiAl3N4
]. The structure of the
polyanion is obviously very dense (Figure 6.26). And considering that also lithium con￾tributes LiN4
tetrahedra, here the effective coordination charge is on average even
higher. The coordination of strontium by AlN4
and LiN4
tetrahedra leads to an almost
perfectly cubic environment.
6.5.5 Phosphates
Because of the higher charge of phosphorus phosphates almost exclusively form ne￾sosilicate, inosilicate and cyclosilicate analogous compounds. The anions comprise pen￾tavalent phosphorus ions coordinated tetrahedrally by oxide. The effective coordination
charge of terminal oxygen atoms is generally lower than in silicates according to
cO-P = 2 −
5
4
= 0.75 (6.36)
Moreover, also the covalency of the interactions between terminal oxygen atoms and
metal atoms is weaker in phosphates as the higher charged phosphorus atoms in the
coordination sphere of oxygen increases their electronegativity. Thus, phosphates show
a weaker coordination than silicates. All structure pictures of this section are depicted
in Figure 6.27.
The famous mineral monazite, i. e., Ce(PO4
), was already mentioned in Chapter 4.
The coordination of the cerium atoms is ninefold and the polyhedron can be described
as a tricapped trigonal prism where one of the caps actually caps a triangular face. It is
apparently a nesosilicate analogous phosphate. In the inosilicate analogous α-Sr[PO3
]
2
,
phosphate helices wriggle through a diamond-like arrangement of strontium atoms.
This diamond-like arrangement is emphasized by a virtual yellow unit cell in Fig￾ure 6.27(d). In total, eight oxygen atoms forming a quite irregular polyhedron coordinate
the strontium atoms. Such polyphosphates are typically synthesized via the reaction of
the respective carbonate with concentrated phosphoric acid according to

the respective amount of any europium oxide and conducting the reaction under reduc￾ing conditions, like in the presence of hydrogen gas [229]. HoH[PO3
]
4
is a further inosili￾cate analogous compound where the holmium atoms are coordinated monocapped pris￾matically by oxygen. As mentioned in the introduction to this section, the electronegativ￾ity of the coordinating oxygen atoms in phosphates is reduced compared with silicates.
Since a ternary silicate featuring Ce4+ is known, it is not surprising that this has also been
reported for phosphates. The inosilicate-analogous Ce[PO3
]
4
contains zig-zag phosphate
chains, which provide an eightfold coordination, best described as bicapped prismatic,
for the tetravalent cerium atoms. Here, the charge balance is easily achieved while a
proton was introduced by nature to compensate the anion’s charge in HoH[PO3

6.5.6 Borophosphates, Borosulfates and Fluorooxoborates
So far, I considered the classic, long known compound classes. In the final section, rel￾evant examples of silicate-analogous compounds of three quite new compound classes
will be discussed. The oldest of these are the borophosphates, which are solids in which
phosphate tetrahedra are condensed with borate tetrahedra or borate triangles [232].
Typical borophosphates are built by a borate backbone and terminal phosphate groups.
Accordingly, mainly the terminal oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups coordinate the
metal atoms. Based on the previous considerations, these terminal oxygen atoms ex￾hibit a coordination strength similar to that of phosphates. However, when compared to
polyphosphates, borophosphates feature a slightly stronger coordination as in the sec￾ond coordination sphere lower charged boron atoms follow. The structure pictures of
this section are depicted in Figure 6.28.92 � 6 Basic Compound Classes

(bottom right); oxygen atoms red, fluorine green phosphorus centered tetrahedra blue, sulfur centered

The strontium borophosphate phosphate Sr6
[B(PO4

4
](PO4
) is a quite typical repre￾sentative. It contains [B(PO4
)
4
] moieties where a boron atom is surrounded tetrahedrally
by four phosphate tetrahedra. Further noncondensed phosphate tetrahedra are present.
Both anions coordinate the strontium atoms in an eightfold manner, resulting in the
formation of a square antiprism and an irregular polyhedron. Also, here the strontium
atoms may be replaced upon doping with Eu2+ ions.
From borophosphate to borosulfates is only a small formal step. Here, instead of
phosphate normally sulfate tetrahedra coordinate boron atoms in a tetrahedral fash￾ion and form the terminal moieties coordinating metal atoms [236, 237]. Therefore, the
effective coordination charge
cO-S = 2 −
6
4
= 0.5 (6.38)
is generally lower than in any other in the so far mentioned silicate-analogous com￾pounds. Gd2
[B2
(SO4
)
6
] contains similar building units like the aforementioned stron￾tium borophosphate, i. e., [B(SO4
)
4
]. But two of them condense to build a vierer ring
cyclosilicate-analogous anion. These anions coordinate the gadolinium atoms in a
square-antiprismatic manner. Due to their similar size, Tb3+ or Eu3+ ions may be doped
onto the gadolinium sites.
In fluorooxoborates, some terminal oxygen atoms are substituted by fluorine atoms.
They reduce the coordination strength further. For instance, a terminal fluoride ion only6.5 Silicates And Selected Silicate-Analogous Compounds � 93
achieves an effective coordination charge of
cF-B = 1 −

3
= 0 (c. n. = 3) (6.39)
for BO3
F tetrahedra and BO2
F triangles. Moreover, the electronegativity of fluorine is
higher than that of oxygen, which reduces covalent interactions to metal atoms. In
Ba[B4O6
F2
], layers of condensed BO3
and BO3
F moieties were reported, which coordi￾nate the barium atoms. These are coordinated by nine oxygen and four flourine atoms
yielding an extraordinarily high coordination number of thirteen with quite long dis￾tances. This situation reminds of the situation in Ba[Si7N10] mentioned earlier. We will
see in Part II how weak this coordination actually is when divalent europium atoms are
doped on the barium sites in these two examples.�Part II: Properties and Applications7 Transitions
Certainly, spectacular properties always fascinate people. Either “magic” behavior like
the attraction of certain objects by others or a “miraculous” glow of cold objects upon
exposure to light are properties for which also rare-earth materials are famous. Accord￾ingly, in this second Part I will discuss selected optical and magnetic properties of such
compounds. Due to the vast spectrum of meanwhile acquired property details and their
applications, this selection has to be incomplete but aims to trigger interest and to en￾able the reader for further self-studies on these topics. Not only for the optical, but also
for the magnetic properties, the knowledge about which transitions are feasible at room
temperature is important. This is relevant to be able to assess a population of ground
and excited states, which may influence the magnetic and optical properties.
7.1 Transition Probability
Between ground and excited states, electronic transitions are feasible. Such transitions
may be excited optically or also thermally. Based on time-dependent perturbation the￾ory, their intensity depends from the transition probability W between the states under
consideration. This probability is proportional to the integral over space of the product
of the wavefunctions of the excited (ψ1
) and the ground state (ψ0
). Moreover, the transi￾tion operator O has to be incorporated:
W ∝ ∫ψ1Oψ0dV (7.1)
From this equation, selection rules will be concluded, which tell us how intense optical
absorptions, excitations and emissions will be. I will restrict the discussion herein to a
rather concise background of the theory, its practical application and assessment of the
results. The deeper background of the theory may be found in [238] or any other book
dealing with an emphasis on electronic transitions.
7.2 Configuration, Terms and Levels
Basically, f–f transitions are parity forbidden. Therefore, electric dipole transitions are
not possible here as the linear transition operator O requires different parities for ψ0
and ψ1
. This will be explained in more detail in Chapter 7.3. But under certain local sym￾metries, partial mixing with states of different parity is allowed giving rise to induced
electric dipole transitions. In the case of rare-earth elements states of different parity
might be 5d states or charge-transfer states. For the following discussion on the Russel–
Saunders coupling scheme, I choose as a prominent example trivalent europium, i. e.,
Eu3+, that comprises the electronic configuration [Xe]4f6
(Table 2.1). Within closed shells

, electrons can only be arranged in a single way. For the remaining six
electrons within the seven 4f orbitals,
(
14
6
) = 3003 (7.2)
arrangements, so-called microstates, are possible. These split energetically into 119
terms due to the interelectronic repulsion of the six electrons. These terms cover all
microstates. The ground term considering Hund’s rule45 carries a total spin of
S = 6 ×
1
2
= 3 (7.3)
giving a spin multiplicity of
M = 2S + 1 = 7 (7.4)
called a septet term.46 Further, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number
amounts to
L = 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + (−1) + (−2) = 3 (7.5)
yielding an F term.
47 The relative orientation of spin and angular momentum is consid￾ered by the good quantum number J running from L + S via L + S − 1 through |L − S|
defining the levels. Below half-occupation of the respective shell, the stability declines
with increasing J and vice versa. In the case of a 4f6
configuration, the minimal J rep￾resents the most stable level in a given term. Thus, the ground term is a septet 7
FJ with
rising level energies according to J ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} covering in total
(2S + 1)(2L + 1) = 49 (7.6)
microstates. The ground level is therefore 7
F0
. Following at higher energies are the 5DJ
with J ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} levels and another 117 terms; a listing of these may be found in
[239]. Within a term, spin-orbit coupling leads to a splitting of the J levels. Finally, the
ligand-field perturbs the J levels further up to 2J + 1 sublevels depending from the local
symmetry (Figure 7.1). To determine the number of lines, character tables containing
irreducible representations are employed. Figure 7.1 displays the magnitude of splitting
on the example of Eu3+. In the spectrum accordingly the emission 5D0→7

via a Zeeman48 effect further. At least for optical properties, the last effect is usually
neglected as its magnitude is very small compared with the other effects, which are
given with approximate magnitudes in Figure 7.1. Contrarily, for the magnetic properties
of trivalent europium these splittings and also the small energy differences between the
ground levels cannot be neglected. With a rising temperature, the excited levels become
increasingly populated altering the magnetic moment of Eu3+. The ground state terms
of all relevant rare-earth ions are given in Table 7.1.

If the electrons are distributed over two or more shells, the respective terms are de￾rived per shell and subsequently coupled. For instance, in Eu2+ ions the excitation from
its 4f7
ground state and 8
S ground term by bluish or higher energetic light usually leads
to a 4f6
5d1
configuration. Such transitions are called interconfigurational transitions. 4f
and 5d states are sufficiently discrete in that their electrons will first couple within the
shell and afterwards both terms will couple. Accordingly, the 4f6
shell yields a ground
term 7
F, the 5 d1
shell a ground term 2D; the coupling of both might lead to spin multi￾plicities 6 or 8, L might total to 1 (P term) or 5 (H term)—with an octet 8H term expected
as lowest energetic excited one. This is indeed the case [240]. But due to transition selec￾tion rules, the most relevant excited term of the 4f6
5d1
configuration is finally 8
P. The
J levels were omitted in this brief discussion, but can certainly be included. In cases of
interconfigurational transitions, such as 5d–4f, the J levels are normally omitted as these
transitions yield broad and unresolved excitation and emission bands.
Throughout this book, the higher energy state is always mentioned first, the lower

absorption or emission, is considered.
7.3 Electric and Magnetic Dipole Transitions
For a basic estimation whether a transition is allowed or forbidden, considering the

This transition will be allowed if the integral is positive and forbidden if it is zero. Any

will be of the first type while any integral comprising an odd function being centrosym￾metric with respect to the origin like
x 󳨃→ x or x 󳨃→ x
3
(7.8)
is of the latter type. The symmetry behavior or so-called parity of respective functions
will be indicated in this book in conformance with group theory as ungerade (German
for odd, indicated with index “u”) and gerade (German for even, indicated with index
“g”), respectively. According to this definition, s orbitals are even ones, p odd, d even and
f odd. Multiplying an odd with an even function yields an odd one, while the products
of two odd or two even functions always are even.
Electrons interact with electromagnetic waves comprising perpendicular oscillating
electric andmagnetic fields propagating with the speed of light. Accordingly, optical tran￾sitions are classified as electric dipole, magnetic dipole and—considering higher-order7.3 Electric and Magnetic Dipole Transitions � 101
interactions—electric quadrupole transitions depending on the respective transition op￾erator. Considering their relative intensities only the first two are relevant and will be
discussed here. Among these, electronic dipole transitions are normally several orders
of magnitude (typically 103
to 105
times) more intense than magnetic dipole transitions.
The symmetry behavior of electronic states can be reliably determined via a care￾ful analysis employing the character table of the local symmetry. Therein not only the
states’ symmetry is relevant but certainly also the symmetry of the transition operator.
An electric dipole operator D transforms like a charge propagating along an axis, i. e.,
like a translation in a character table with odd symmetry [241, Chapter 4.5]. Hence, the
characters of the product under the integral
W ∝ ∫ψ1Dψ0dV (7.9)
with D = μr are obtained as direct product of characters.49 Therefore, the transition
operator according to
χ (ψ1
) ⊗ χ (ψ0
) ⊗ χ (D) (7.10)
can be calculated. The resulting representation has to contain the total symmetric repre￾sentation of the point group. Only then a positive integral is obtained. Since the electric
dipole operator is an odd operator, the parities of both wavefunctions have to be differ￾ent. This is also known as Laporte50 or parity selection rule, i. e., ΔL = ±1, and it is in
accordance with the classic approach, the rule of conservation of all angular moments,
as the emitted photon carries an angular momentum of l = 1. The Laporte rule requires
the change of parity during transition. In case of accordingly forbidden transitions, these
might become partially allowed if the surrounding allows for mixing with states of op￾posite parity. In a non-centrosymmetric surrounding, 4f states might mix with 5d states
to some extent. This rule can be exemplified on a simple case considering the character
table of point group Oh
. In a centrosymmetric environment like the octahedral one, the
set of d orbitals transforms like the symmetry races eg + t2g
, the set of f orbitals trans￾forms like a2u + t1u + t2u
.
51 Consequently, a mixing of f and d states is symmetrically
forbidden. What changes upon lifting the inversion symmetry? In the resulting point
group O, any set of d states transforms like e + t2 and any set of f states like a2 + t1 + t2
.
Thus, the states transforming like t2 may mix. For those striving for further reading, I
recommend [241].
Analogously, the significantly less intense magnetic dipole electronic transitions are
treated. The magnetic dipole transition operator M corresponds to a rotating charge

probability
W ∝ ∫ψ1Mψ0dV > 0. (7.11)
Here, in contrast to electric dipole transitions no parity change is allowed between both
states as M is an even operator and any change of parity would cause the integral to
vanish. Thus, the selection rule for magnetic dipole transitions is ΔL = 0. An exemplary
calculation how to determine if a given pair of wavefunctions yields an allowed transi￾tion according to the discussion in this chapter is given in the Appendix E.
The frequency of the light under consideration influences the manner in which light
interacts with matter as its oscillations may induce oscillations within the irradiated
atoms. While low-frequent light enables the excitation of molecular rotations or vibra￾tions of chemical bonds, the light corresponding to electronic transitions is orders of
magnitude too fast for both. This is reflected in the Franck–Condon principle52 based
on the Born–Oppenheimer approximation;
53 this tells us that nuclear and electronic mo￾tions are independent. Thus, atomic movements can be neglected in the course of an op￾tical electronic transition. According to the actual speed of transitions, electronic transi￾tions occur on a femtosecond scale, vibronic ones on a picosecond scale with an approx￾imate lifetime of excited states ranging from the nanosecond through to the millisecond
scale for allowed and forbidden transitions, respectively.
7.4 Spin Selection Rule
Finally, the spin of both states has to be considered. The emitted or absorbed photon, on
one hand, carries no spin. On the other hand, the spin must not change because the over￾all spin of the system is to be conserved. Therefore, the spin of both states must not be
different. This is known as the spin selection rule ΔS = 0. With increasing atomic mass,
the Russel–Saunders coupling becomes less important compared with jj coupling. Thus,
the quantum numbers L and S are less precisely defined. Accordingly, the spin and angu￾lar momentum selection rule changes smoothly to a selection rule regarding J, and the
spin selection rule applies less strictly. This means that even at low temperatures tran￾sition intensity can be recorded for spin-forbidden transitions, although significantly

7.5 Jablonski Diagrams
During your studies on luminescence of rare-earth ions, you will frequently come across
so-called Jablonski diagrams54 like the one shown in Figure 7.2 (right). In such diagrams,
all relevant electronic states including their vibrational sublevels are sketched relatively
to energy. The energy is normally given on the ordinate against a rough radius or reac￾tion coordinate on the abscissa. Within this scheme, transitions like optical absorptions
as well as possible energy transfer mechanisms or energy loss pathways and feasible
luminescence emissions either as fluorescence or phosphorescence are illustrated.
Figure 7.2: Potential curves of a ground (orange) and an excited state (green) with light blue vibrational
sublevels and a Jablonski diagram displaying schematically relevant electronic states and vibrational sub￾levels; shown are also an absorption A, a subsequent vibrational relaxation V, a fluorescence F and a phos￾phorescence P emission.
Each electronic state should be viewed as a potential curve like that of an anhar￾monic oscillator with a series of vibronic sublevels starting from a vibrational ground
54 Aleksander Jabłoński, Polish physicist (*1898 †1980).104 � 7 Transitions
level; with increasing vibrational energy this potential curve develops increasingly an￾harmonically caused by interactions with adjacent atoms. While in harmonic oscilla￾tors, the energy gap between two arbitrary adjacent vibronic sublevels is the same; in
real, anharmonic ones, this energy gap decreases with increasing energy as shown in
Figure 7.2 (left). The width of the potential curve also illustrates the imagined radial in￾terval within the object oscillates. You may imagine a child on a swing; this child will
have the highest speed in the minimum of the potential curve where the whole poten￾tial energy is converted into kinetic energy. Moreover, the maximum probability density
to find an oscillating object within any vibrational level is on the turning points where
the object has speed zero and only possesses potential energy. Hence, in terms of the
potential curve the probability density of an object will be highest near both ends of the
vibrational level. This also means that electronic transitions will end at that sublevel
with the highest probability density, and that will be close to the point where the as￾cending (absorption) or descending transition (emission) intersects the potential curve
of the target electronic state.
In a Jablonski diagram, the states are also assigned their term symbols, which have
been derived in Chapter 7.2. In our schematic diagram, we use the singlet states 1
S0
(elec￾tronic ground state), 1
S1
(excited singlet state) and an excited triplet state 3
T1
, which is
lower in energy than 1
S1
as the repulsion of electrons with opposite spin is smaller than
of those with the same.
Electronic excitations like A in Figure 7.2 and relaxations like F or P are faster (ap￾prox. 10−15 sec) than any vibrational mode (approx. 10−13 sec) caused upon an optical
transition. Accordingly, the average radius position of the electron would not change
during the transition. Since on the abscissa the radius is plotted, only vertical arrows
represent such optical absorptions and emissions. This is known as Franck–Condon prin￾ciple based on the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. After such an optical transition, an
excited vibrational state is yielded from which thermal relaxation until the vibrational
ground state of the target electronic state occurs. This lasts approximately 10−13 sec.
From an excited electronic state like 1
S1
, a direct transition to the ground state 1
S0
can
occur either by optical emission as fluorescence F, lasting approximately 10−9
sec, or
radiationless as internal conversion, abbreviated IC. Internal conversion may occur, if
an excited vibrational state of 1
S0
is within reach. For instance, if both potential curves
touch close the vibrational ground state of 1
S1
as depicted in the Jablonski diagram. A
further alternative is an intersystem crossing (ISC in Figure 7.2), which represents a ra￾diationless energy transfer to a close state of different spin multiplicity like 3
T1
. Energy
transfers are generally depicted by a horizontal arrow since during this process in first
approximation no energy is lost; as the energy is plotted on the ordinate, arrows have to
be horizontal indicating the states from and to which the energy is transferred. A more
thorough discussion on energy transfer mechanisms follows in Chapter 7.6. From the
excited state 3
T1
, the energy might be released as luminescence. This process is rather
slow due to the spin selection rule, which lowers the transition probability significantly7.6 Energy Transfer Mechanisms � 105
and which can only be bypassed via spin-orbit coupling. Luckily, this is in action for
rare-earth atoms.
The thermal relaxations after optical excitation and relaxation lead to rearrange￾ments of the system, and thus slight changes of the interatomic distances and energetic
stabilizations. Consequently, during a whole cascade from optical absorption, via vibra￾tional relaxation to final optical emission (either F or P) energy is lost and the emission
occurs at longer wavelengths than the excitation. This energy shift is called the Stokes
shift and is typically small for 4f–4f emitters and large for 5d–4f emitters.
7.6 Energy Transfer Mechanisms
Energy transfer processes cause several consequences. First, any energy transfer from
an excited atom D, the donor, onto another atom A, the acceptor or activator, quenches
feasible luminescence from D. Second, this may be beneficial if A takes advantage of this
energy. Possibly A lacks of another efficient excitation process—and eventually lumi￾nesces. Third, A may collect more than one excitation and finally emits a single photon
of higher energy than initially by D absorbed, i. e., up-conversion. Here, we will focus
on those energy transfer mechanisms important for rare-earth compounds discussed in
this book.
As depicted in Figure 7.3, initially the donor species D absorbs energy like a pho￾ton yielding an electronic excitation into an arbitrary vibrational sublevel of an excited
electronic state. From here, it relaxes fast to the bottom sublevel of the excited state.
Then the energy might either be emitted by fluorescence or it is transferred onto other
nearby atoms A. This gives rise for quenching pathways, sensitized luminescence in the
so-called antenna phosphors or up-conversion processes. Such energy transfers are only
feasible if the energies of both transitions are very similar or if the tiny difference might
be settled employing phonons. To distinguish between radiative and nonradiative trans￾fers, one measures the respective lifetime of the excited donor state. If the transfer is
radiative, this lifetime would be independent from the activators concentration; if the
transfer is nonradiative, an increasing concentration of A would yield a shorter lifetime.
Figure 7.3: After excitation of donor D by a photon (blue) into an arbitrary vibrational sublevel (light blue)
of the excited electronic state (upper black bar) fast vibrational relaxation (red) occurs; in case of resonance
(green) with suited states on acceptor A the energy is transferred and finally emitted (yellow); the FRET
requires an overlap of emission spectrum of D (EmD
) and excitation spectrum of A (ExcA
).106 � 7 Transitions
In general, the probability of an energy transfer scales with the spectral overlap of emis￾sion of D and excitation of A. Further, it is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the
donor excited state, because the longer the excited state lives, the higher the chance of
energy transfer from here. Practically, these energy transfers might occur by emission
from D and direct absorption of this emitted light by A or the energy transfer occurs
radiationless. There are two radiationless energy transfer mechanisms, the FRET and
Dexter mechanisms.
7.6.1 FRET Mechanism
By the Förster55 Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), only energy is swapped between
D and A [242]. This is possible as soon as there is an energetic overlap of D’s emission
spectrum and A’s excitation spectrum because then both atoms can get into resonance.
Based on a classic model, the excited pulsating dipole D causes oscillations on A, and
thus transfers energy. According to quantum mechanics, this energy transfer occurs if
there is a positive overlap of the wavefunctions of the excited state on D and the ground
state on A. The type of transition may be electric dipole, magnetic or other multipole
transition; the respective selection rules apply. In solids, additionally the relative orien￾tation of both moments, donor and acceptor has to be considered. Classically treated,
this is akin to proper positions of emitter D and antenna A. In liquids, these geometric
considerations also apply but due to permanent reorientation of molecules and ions an
averaged situation can be assumed. According to the type of transition, the transfer ef￾ficiency relates to the distance between D and A. For instance, in case of a dipole-dipole
transition the efficiency decreases with r
−6
. It certainly also scales with the overlap in￾tegral of D’s emission spectrum and A’s excitation spectrum shown as the green area
in 7.3. Consequently, such energy transfers may occur via quite large distances up to
approximately 100 Å.
7.6.2 Dexter Mechanism
Contrarily to the FRET mechanism, in the course of the Dexter56 mechanism, a (blue)
excited electron in Figure 7.4 on the energy-donor D swaps with a (green) ground state
electron on the energy-acceptor A to exchange energy. Accordingly, this requires a di￾rect overlap of orbital clouds, i. e., covalent interactions between both protagonists lim￾iting the regime to distances of approximately 10 Å for such transitions. The efficiency of
Dexter-type energy transfers typically decays exponentially with increasing distance r.

Akin to the FRET mechanism, the emission and excitation spectra of D and A have
to overlap. In contrast to FRET, a spin transfer can be achieved as shown in the example
displayed in Figure 7.4, where the formal reaction

(7.13)
to give singlet states. Thus, a so-called triplet triplet annihilation (TTA) results. The im￾portant consequence is that both excitations add up on a single A atom yielding a single
emission with almost double frequency related to the excitation energy. Hence, an im￾portant up-conversion process is provided. Up-conversion luminescence is treated in
more detail in Chapter 8.4.7.
7.7 Further Parameters
In this chapter, we will shortly discuss further parameters, which are relevant figures
especially of luminescent materials like bandwidth, thermal quenching and some re￾marks on colorimetry.
7.7.1 Bandwidth of a Transition
The Jablonski diagram in Figure 7.2 might suggest that only distinct optical transitions
are feasible, but actually also transitions to adjacent vibronic sublevels with somewhat
lower transition probabilities occur. This leads to a bandwidth of the absorption and the
emission spectrum as depicted in Figure 7.3 (right). This bandwidth depends from few
main factors.
Ground and excited states are described by potential curves (Figure 7.2, left). The
broader a potential curve, the smaller the energy gap between adjacent vibrational108 � 7 Transitions
sublevels and the more transitions become probable. The excited states’ potentials are
normally shifted to larger radii, since increased electronic repulsion enlarges their ra￾dius. In the case of 4f–5d transitions, even another shell on a higher orbit becomes occu￾pied. Moreover, states with a larger radius interact stronger covalently with neighboring
atoms. This so-called nephelauxetic effect, described in Chapter 8.1, further increases the
width of these states. Additionally, the diffusivity of states is reflected in the width of the
respective potential curve. In the case of transitions from contracted 4f to diffuse 5d
states, the latter not only show a strong radial shift but also a clearly broader potential
leading to very broad excitation and emission bands. So both, increasing radial shift as
well as increasing the width of excited states foster larger transition bandwidths.
With increasing concentration of the emitting ions in a luminescent material, their
average distance decreases. Consequently, interactions among them become more and
more relevant. Such interactions may further yield broader potentials and larger radial
shifts of excited states. By the way, this also enhances nonradiative transition probabil￾ities. These consequences lead to concentration quenching of selected emissions—via
cross-relaxation as discussed for Tb3+ in Chapter 8.4.2—or of the luminescence at all.
Independently from these two effects, increasing temperature contributes to the
bandwidth as higher and higher vibrational sublevels are populated; at 300 K, the ther￾mal energy amounts to
kBT ≈ 0.026 eV ≈ 208 cm−1
(7.14)
leading to a thermal equilibrium. This figure is relevant for the estimation whether lev￾els above the ground level are thermally populated, and thus have to be considered
accordingly.
7.7.2 Thermal Quenching and Concentration Quenching
With an increasing temperature also in the excited state, a thermal equilibrium is
achieved yielding the population of higher vibrational sublevels. Generally, optical
emission processes compete with radiationless internal conversion to states of the emit￾ter himself as depicted in Figure 7.2. Alternatively, possibly existing charge-transfer
states might be addressed as described in Chapter 8.2. The more and the higher vi￾brational levels are populated, the higher the probability of internal conversion or
thermal quenching becomes. Consequently, the luminescence intensity IT decreases
with increasing temperature T according to

with a materials constant and the activation energy E of the radiationless transition

of the maximum intensity. Figure 7.5 displays the thermal behavior of the luminescence
of Sr2
[Si5N8
]:Eu2+ monitored around 620 nm according to Table 8.5 (Chapter 8.5.2). For
the excitation at 160 nm, TQ accordingly lies around 160 °C, for the excitation at 440 nm
the thermal quenching temperature lies beyond 350 °C, apparently. Radiationless transi￾tions occur in the regime of the intersection point of the potentials of ground and excited
states. Therefore, TQ depends from the relative radial shift and differing widths of both
potentials. They can be analogously discussed as done in the chapter previously. Regard￾ing the charge-transfer states, TQ declines with decreasing transition energy. A similar
effect is caused with increasing concentration of the emitting ion, called concentration
quenching. Then a growing interaction between neighboring emitters can cause reab￾sorption of the emitted luminescence. Therefore, for every phosphor exists an optimum
emitter concentration, which is the higher, the less allowed the emission transition is.
7.7.3 Color Coordinates
An important colorimetric figure are color coordinates. To standardize the color per￾ception by the human eye, the CIE57 developed a color diagram in 1931 comprising all
visible colors, depicted in Figure 7.6. Based on the sensitivity curves of cone-cells of the
human eye, three color coordinates can be calculated from any emission or absorption
spectrum. Because
x + y + z ≡ 1 (7.16)
a two-dimensional plot of two coordinates is sufficient. On the curved edge of the dia￾gram, the pure colors are found while on the base-line the nonspectral colors like purple
are situated. In the center, all colors add up to white. Complementary colors are arranged
symmetrically with respect to the white point.
Practically, the CIE lists three sensitivity curves between 380 and 780 nm, which
were meanwhile updated and can be downloaded from the internet, e. g., via http://
57 Commission International de l’Eclairage.110 � 7 Transitions

cvrl.ioo.ucl.ac.uk. Then these data are multiplied with the experimental spectral data
of a recorded spectrum and the color coordinates are obtained. For instance, for the
aforementioned phosphor Sr2

Sr6

):Eu2+ of x = 0.47 and y = 0.53 were reported [227, 245].
If a display is driven with three emitters (red, green and blue), the accessible color
gamut corresponds to the triangle spanned by the three color coordinates. The same
holds for phosphor-converted LEDs, where one color point is defined by the usually blue
LED source and at least one, normally several phosphors converting blue into respective
color points; this enables to tune the LED emission within the spanned color gamut by
respective mixing of the contributing emissions.
7.7.4 Color Temperature
Closely related to the color coordinates is the colorimetric figure of the color tempera￾ture of light sources, which corresponds to the emission of a black body radiator at that
certain temperature. The emission spectrum of a black body radiator was derived by
Planck58 where the spectral radiance at a wavelength λ is given via

Interestingly, a really hot black body radiator of 10,000 K emits already bluish light nor￾mally perceived as cold light, while a comparably cool black body of 1,000 K emits red￾dish light perceived as warm light (Figure 7.6). Daylight, which is essentially the refer￾ence for white light, corresponds to a color temperature of ca. 5,800 K. The color coordi￾nates of a light source determine its color temperature.
7.8 Transitions within a 4f Configuration—Judd–Ofelt Theory
In Chapter 2.1, we discussed the special situation of orbitals like 1s, 2p, 3d and 4f, which
are the first of their family, and thus lack radial nodes. We drew the conclusion that this
leads to relatively contracted or localized orbitals. This makes it difficult to ionize elec￾trons therein. In every case where electrons are hard to ionize, these apparently expe￾rience a quite strong effective nuclear charge. This furthermore yields a good shielding
effect on more outwards localized orbitals. In the specific case of 4f orbitals, electrons
therein screen next shell’s orbitals 5s, 5p and 5d very well. Therefore, these are very
diffuse (Figure 7.7), changing now the point-of-view onto an approaching nearby atom.
This might, for instance, stem from a ligand or is just a single coordinating one. For
this approaching atom, the 4f orbitals are hardly visible behind the completely filled
5s2
p
6
shell—having in mind the image used in Figure 2.2. This filled octet shell shields
the 4f orbitals very well against approaching atoms or ions as their electron density is
repelled. Accordingly, the interaction of 4f electrons with adjacent atoms is weak, and
the ligand-field splitting is small. This results in the remarkable situation that the en￾ergetic positions of 4f levels are almost independent from the chemical environment.
Furthermore, also the energies of optical transitions within the 4f shell only show mi￾nor influence from ligands. This situation is beneficial for those who would interpret
spectra of 4f–4f transitions. And it is beneficial for those looking for a suited dopant
to achieve a specific luminescence emission since they do not have to care very much
for the chemical surrounding as long as the band-gap is large enough and the site to be
doped is appropriate. This will be a topic later, though, in Chapter 8.4.

Due to this advantage, Dieke60 collected the absorption and luminescence data of
trivalent lanthanide ions published up to the early 1960s and set up the so-called Dieke
diagram covering all experimentally recorded 4f levels up to 42,000 cm– 1 [246]. He also
marked all states from which emissions had been observed until then in respectively
doped LaCl3 with a filled semicircle like a hanging drop below each line representing a
level. The width of these lines was chosen with respect to the observed splitting of the
terms in the spectra of the respective LnCl3
. Since then, the energy regime of the Dieke
diagram was extended to 70,000 cm– 1 [247]. Finally, all 4f levels were calculated, ranging
up to 200,000 cm– 1, many of them unobserved so far [248]. A complete list of atomic
energy levels was collected in [240], which is available free of charge on the internet and
which are the base of the term schemes shown in this book. These data can also be used
for assigning 4f–4f transitions of R2+ or R4+ ions by choosing the respective electronic
configuration, e. g., for Eu2+ the data of Gd3+ [249]. Due to the lower charge, the transition
energies are reduced by 10 to 30 % according to data listed on https://physics.nist.gov/
PhysRefData/ASD/levels_form.html.
In Figure 7.8, a selection of these collected data is depicted. Note that the terms of a
considered 4fn
configuration are the same as those of the 4f14 – n configuration but with
opposite order. This is obvious for the terms 7

of Eu3+ and Tb3+. Hence, the con￾figurations 4f1
and 4f13 or 4f6
and 4f8
are named spectroscopic twins. Moreover, the en￾ergies of corresponding levels differ. This is due the increasing nuclear charge resulting
in a stronger splitting of all states. The effect is further enhanced by a decreasing ionic
radii going from left to right yielding a stronger interaction of the 4f electrons with the
nuclear charge. For trivalent europium, also excited states assigned as ligand-to-metal

charge-transfer states (LMCT) are already indicated, which will be discussed in the next
chapter.
You may wonder why I did not yet mention the next empty and basically available
5d states. In Figure 7.8, only for trivalent cerium and terbium the relative approximate
position of 5d states are indicated. We will see in Chapter 8.3 that the vacuum referred
binding energies of the 5d states are more or less constant for all rare-earth ions; the
energy gap between the 5d and 4f ground states runs through a maximum for the 4f7
configuration, though. Figure 7.9 shows the energy differences of the lowest lying 5d and
the 4f ground states of the free Ln3+ ions. Regarding this interconfigurational transition
from 4f to 5d, the excited electron might retain or switch its spin. This situation is illus￾trated in the right part of Figure 7.9 on the example of Tb3+. Hence, two different excited
states with configuration 4f7
5d1
arise. In the low-spin state (blue), a total spin of 6/2 re￾sults, in the high-spin state (orange) of 8/2. The ground state configuration 4f8
features a
total spin of 6/2. Consequently, the excitation to the low-spin state (blue) is allowed with
respect to the spin selection rule, and that to the high-spin state is forbidden (orange).
Thus, the forbidden transition is very weak, if observed at all.
Figure 7.9: Energy differences of the lowest 5d states, discriminated according high and low spin, and the
ground 4f states of the free Ln3+ ions calculated based on the data provided in [252]; illustration of the
difference between high and low spin on the example of Tb3+
.
Generally, the high-spin state is more stable than the low-spin state. This can be ra￾tionalized by Hund’s rule and recalling our discussion on shielding in Chapter 2.1. Elec￾trons are better shielded by electrons of opposite spin and vice versa. Therefore, in the
low-spin situation the 5d electron is shielded clearly better and might be released eas￾ier than in the high-spin situation. Thus, the low-spin state is situated at higher energy
than the high-spin state. This effect declines with growing occupation along the series as
obvious from Figure 7.9 since the shielding becomes increasingly similar for both situa￾tions. The discrimination of high- and low-spin states is practically only relevant for the
second-half of the 4f series. Up to half-occupied 4f states the high-spin 5d–4f transitions114 � 7 Transitions
are the spin-allowed ones and the only ones shown. In the second-half, the high-spin
5d–4f transitions are the spin-forbidden ones. So, the blue marked 5d states are the ones
involved in spin-allowed transitions throughout Figure 7.9.
Absolutely, the energy differences between 5d and 4f states reflect the relative sta￾bilities of the respective 4f configuration. These increase with growing nuclear charge
as a general trend. Because of the specific stability of a semifilled 4f shell, the differ￾ence reaches a first maximum for Gd3+. The eighth electron is shielded clearly better
in Tb3+ (electronic configuration [Xe]4f8
) according to the discussion given just before,
because it is the first with opposite spin. It is therefore clearly easier ionized than the
seventh in Gd3+. Thus, the 4f ground state of trivalent terbium is lifted significantly in
energy. Hence, the energy difference between 5d and 4f is markedly reduced for Tb3+
.
The development proceeds with a further increase until the end of the series where the
second maximum is achieved. These energy differences can be measured very well by
absorption spectroscopy. The basic values of the free ions were extracted from many
compounds and led to estimated values for the free ions depicted in Figure 7.9. These
values lie—apart from a few cases—far below the visible wavelength regime in the ul￾traviolet or even vacuum ultraviolet regimes.61 In oxides, electrostatic and covalent in￾teractions lower the 5d–4f differences up to 30,000 cm– 1 for trivalent lanthanide ions
[250, 251]. Accordingly, the only exception where visible or u. v. luminescence may oc￾cur directly from 5d states in trivalent lanthanide ions are Pr3+ and Ce3+ discussed in
Chapters 8.4.9 and 8.5.1. Excitation from the 4f ground states into the 5d excited states
is basically possible for all trivalent ions and can be safely discriminated by their huge
bandwidth compared with 4f–4f transitions as discussed later in Chapter 8.3. Figure 7.9
tells us, though, that even 5d←4f excitations in the near u. v. are restricted to Ce3+, Tb3+
and Pr3+. Here, I shall continue with a theory analyzing the intensities of 4f–4f transi￾tions.
Within a few months in 1962, a theory was published independently by Judd62 and
Ofelt,63 which addresses the transition probabilities, and thus the intensities of induced
electric dipole transitions within the 4f shell [253, 254]. Their semi-empiric approach
was inevitable due to the overwhelmingly vast number of states. Thus, ab initio calcu￾lations needed infinite memory and processor resources, which is still on the agenda
today. The transition moments of magnetic dipole transitions can be calculated directly
from the free-ion 4f wavefunctions, because the magnetic dipole operator is of even par￾ity, and thus only states of same parity contribute (Equation (7.11)). Contrarily, the tran￾sition moments or probabilities of induced electric dipole transitions require a special
parametrization as here appropriate mixing of the wavefunctions with those of oppo￾site parity—odd-parity electronic states or vibrations—is required (Equation (7.9)). Such

where a decreasing energy difference in the denominator enhances the mixing, so does
a positive scalar product of the 4f

C in the numerator. Due to this mixing—for instance with 5d or charge-transfer states—
some parity change between the ground and excited state wavefunctions |B⟩ and ⟨B

is achieved. Then the intensity of this, otherwise according to the parity selection rule
forbidden, pure 4f–4f transition is increased. A further discussion on the consequences
and the ongoing scientific debate on mechanisms of such mixing will be found at the
end of Chapter 8.3 and in Chapter 8.4.3 where hypersensitive transitions are treated.

in which m represents the electron’s mass, ν the mean transition frequency, h Planck’s
constant and ξ considers the refractive index of the medium. Judd and Ofelt assumed
for their approximation that the 4f levels under the ligand field are narrow enough to be
well separated from others. So, the mixing of different J levels can be neglected. More￾over, the energy differences employed in Equation (7.19) are thus equal for both 4f states;
especially, the first approximation has to be kept in mind as J mixing certainly takes
place to some extent. But nevertheless the results of Judd’s and Ofelt’s approach—now
known as the Judd–Ofelt theory—are astonishingly precise. Considering the transition

Because of some J-J’ mixing, as mentioned before, these selection rules are somewhat
weakened. For magnetic dipole transitions within a 4f configuration, these selection
rules apply:116 � 7 Transitions
ΔL = 0
ΔJ = 0, 1, but 0 → 0 is forbidden (7.23)
Here, you may recall the discussion on the Laporte rule in Chapter 7.3. Note also, that
for the selection rules of the induced electric dipole transitions only the better quan￾tum number J is mentioned. Therefore, all selection rules within the Russel–Saunders
scheme are weakened as spin-orbit coupling cannot be neglected in this thorough ap￾proach [255]. The squared reduced matrix element terms |⟨ψJ

values suggest thereby
high transition probabilities, and the higher, the stronger apparently the average mixing
with opposite-parity states. This behavior will be of further interest in the Chapters 8.3
and 8.4 on the chemical shift model and the 4f–4f emitters, respectively.
The intensity parameters Ωλ
(λ = 2, 4, 6) in Equation 7.21 are determined by a least￾squares fit of the experimental data. They represent physically the square of the charge
displacement due to the induced electric dipole transition. Mathematically, they repre￾sent the radial part of the wave function. For instance, in absorption spectra of trivalent

The Ωλ parameters can also be obtained from emission spectra by integrating the
areas under the emission bands of the respective transitions. Employing this approach
a software is being developed, which currently covers Eu3+ emission spectra only [259,
260]. The obtained Judd–Ofelt parameters Ωλ
can be employed to calculate the transi￾tion probabilities of all transitions within the considered chemical situation. An elabo￾rate description has to be considered to prepare the data properly for calculations and
I suggest to refer to [239] and [261]. A detailed practical guide can be consulted in [262].
BonnMag is another program to calculate absorption spectra and temperature depen￾dent magnetic susceptibilities of rare-earth ions. This emphasizes the relevance not only
for the optical, but also the magnetic properties. You will find further details regarding
BonnMag in [263] and the results of an application in [264]. Here, we shall now proceed
with a concrete discussion of the optical properties of rare-earth elements.8 Optical Properties
8.1 Nephelauxetic Effect
In the previous chapter, we discussed the Judd–Ofelt theory to estimate transition prob￾abilities of electric dipole transitions within a 4f configuration. The 4f shell is very well
shielded against approaching ligands, and thus interaction with these is very weak. Con￾trarily, the diffuse 5d states may interact directly and will interact strongly with elec￾trons of ligands coordinating the rare-earth ions. Such covalent interactions cause the
nephelauxetic effect. Any covalent interaction broadens the orbital’s potential toward the
covalently bound atom. Thus, the electron cloud of the metal ion moves to some extent
toward its ligand as depicted in Figure 8.1. Consequently, the electron cloud expands. Jør￾gensen64 apparently knew Greek—“cloud” means nephos and “to expand” translates to
auxanomai. He accordingly suggested nephelauxetic effect for this phenomenon initially
described for outer transition metal complexes. For the sake of better understanding,
I shall explain this phenomenon on an as simple as possible example. The transfer on
rare-earth chemistry follows at the end of this chapter. The stronger the nephelauxetic
effect is, the stronger the radial shift of the potential curve becomes, strengthening the
Stokes shift. Moreover, its shape becomes broader, and it is better stabilized. The respec￾tive curve is therefore lowered in energy. This covalent interaction increases with soft
ligands according to the green scenario in Figure 8.1 and decreases with hard ligands
(blue scenario). As consequence, a strong nephelauxetic effect yields in average larger
electron-electron distances on the metal atom, and thus a reduced repulsion. For outer
transition metals, this was quantified employing the Racah parameters. The nephelaux￾Figure 8.1: The nephelauxetic effect schematically displayed by the covalent interaction of a metal ion’s d
orbital with a hard (blue scenario) and a soft (green) ligand; on the left, the potential curves of the ground
state (black) contrasted with those of the excited state with a hard and a soft ligand.

(8.1)
For transition metals, Jørgensen derived a quantitative nephelauxetic series [265]. To get
an impression, in Table 8.1 the ξ values of ligands coordinated to the 3d and 4d transition
metal ions Cr3+ and Rh3+ are listed. With decreasing ξ, the nephelauxetic effect of the
respective ligand becomes stronger, the interacting states on the metal atom become
diffuser. As expected, the latter holds vertically in Table 8.1. The ligands show stronger
nephelauxetic effects as the coordinating atom becomes chemically softer. Here, also
the atoms bound to these coordinating atoms are relevant, which can be nicely seen
considering the row H2O, (NH2

that the effect increases with increasing polarizability of the ligand, which is perfectly
in line with the previous discussion [266].

You might wonder, why I am discussing this topic so thoroughly as the 4f states only
show very weak covalent interactions with ligands? But as soon as 5d states enter the
stage—in examples like Ce3+, Eu2+, Tb3+, Yb2+ and others—the nephelauxetic effect dom￾inates the energetic position of the 5d states with respect to the 4f ground states. Thus,
the above drawn conclusions regarding the nephelauxetic effect are important as it will
help us to estimate emission colors of phosphors containing rare-earth ions where 5d
states play the crucial role. Furthermore, the detailed analysis of the optical properties
of a single rare-earth ion delivers precise predictions of those of any other rare-earth
ion. Also, for rare-earth ions the nephelauxetic ratio may be determined experimentally.
The challenging task here is the calculation of the interelectronic repulsion parameters
of the non-coordinated rare-earth ions, especially their separation from ligand-field ef￾fects and states of odd parity. Therefore, this cannot be treated precisely by Judd–Ofelt
theory, as this applies an overall view on the ions. There has been quite a lot work done,
but this is beyond the scope of this book as the results for nephelauxetic ratios for 4f8.2 Charge-Transfer Transitions � 119
states listed in Table 8.1 are almost negligible. Perhaps if you are interested in more de￾tails here, then I would recommend [268–271]. For Pr3+, nephelauxetic ratios of a typical
4f–4f transition are given in Table 8.1 [267].
In general, the Judd–Ofelt parameters U
λ
reflect the miscibility with states of oppo￾site parity, and thus the effect of covalency on induced electric dipole transitions. Here
both, 5d and charge-transfer states, give rise for covalent interactions with ligands. Ap￾proximate nephelauxetic ratios may also be determined by comparing the relative en￾ergies of excited states against a reference like the respective fluoride. For comparison
purposes, I added the nephelauxetic ratios calculated by the relative transition energies
of the prominent 3
P0→3H4
transition scaled to the precise calculation in the table. The
figures very nicely quantify the weak covalent interaction of the inner transition metal
ions R3+ with ligands compared with outer transition metals.
8.2 Charge-Transfer Transitions
8.2.1 General Aspects
During charge-transfer transitions, an electron moves upon optical excitation temporar￾ily between two adjacent atoms. Such transitions can therefore essentially be under￾stood as a redox reaction. The optical energy needed corresponds to the oxidation and
reduction potentials of both partners. For instance, in the series of the isoelectronic col￾ored ions, MnO–
4
and CrO2 –

during which an electron is transferred from a ligand to a metal in the course of a ligand￾to-metal charge-transfer transition (LMCT). In the case of MnO–
4
, blue, green as well as
yellow light and in the case of CrO2 –

ultraviolet as well as blue light is absorbed yielding
the intensely violet and yellow ions, respectively. The absorption maximum of chromate
lies in the u. v. but reaches until the bluish regime while permanganate’s absorption
peaks in the green regime at significantly lower energy. This coincides with the higher
oxidation potential of permanganate compared with chromate in aqueous solutions.
Another vivid picture for the basic understanding may be to consider the charge
gradient between both partners—which eventually urges a temporary redox reaction.
The lower the stability of the high oxidation state, the lower the charge-transfer states
are located energetically. Hence, the absorption energy is a measure for the stability
of respectively oxidized species, and consequently, its optical electronegativity. Further
prominent examples are transition metals in high oxidation states like tungstates, tan-120 � 8 Optical Properties
talates, titanates and vanadates. Also, in so simple anions like sulphates charge-transfer
transitions are observed, normally deep in the u. v. regime reflecting their high stability.
Since an electron moves from one partner to a bonding state between both, the
wavefunctions of both partners, they have to overlap. The potential curves of such
charge-transfer states (CTS) are normally broad and considerably radially shifted, as
they are positioned somewhere in between the partners. Both effects yield broad bands
in absorption, excitation and emission spectra. Moreover, as these transitions are al￾lowed, they are very efficient, and thus intense, if the other prerequisites like proper or￾bital overlap are met. We looked at these prerequisites in Chapter 7.6 on energy transfer
mechanisms. For the sake of completeness, I would like to mention that charge-transfer
transitions are also possible between two metal ions of different oxidation states like
in Pb[iv]Pb[ii]
2
O4
. These so-called intervalence charge-transfer transitions (IVCT) cause
brightly colored or even black compounds.
The absorbed energy might be directly released as radiation again, certainly with a
distinct Stokes shift considering the radial shift and broadness of typical CTS potentials.
Additionally, the ion in its lower oxidation state is larger causing further steric relax￾ation. Alternatively—and this is the main reason why such excitations are important at
least in this book—the energy might be transferred via a simple transfer mechanism as
discussed in Chapter 7.6 onto another emitting ion such as a trivalent rare-earth ion. In
this case, the moiety excited via a charge-transfer acts as an antenna to harvest optical
energy efficiently due to its allowed nature. Consequently, it pumps the emitting states
of emitters whose excitation is less allowed or even forbidden due to selection rules
in action. Phosphors based on this principle are called antenna phosphors and will be
discussed in Chapter 8.4.2.
8.2.2 View on Rare-Earth Ions
In some cases, though, even the emitting rare-earth ion may directly been excited via a
ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition. This occurs if the oxidation potential is high
enough as another quite stable electronic configuration is achieved. Such an example is
trivalent europium. Its electronic configuration is 4f6
and if it caught an electron from,
say, a neighboring oxide ion according to the schematic reaction

a semifilled f-shell is achieved. This is in excellent agreement with the relatively high sta￾bility of divalent europium ions. Similar situations are found for the rare-earth ions Yb3+
(4f13), Sm3+ (4f5
) and Tm3+ (4f12). For the remaining ions, normally significantly higher
transition energies are required, a fact limiting practical relevance.
In spectra, charge-transfer transitions can be discriminated from 4f–4f transi￾tions by two parameters. As mentioned, charge-transfer transitions show significantly8.2 Charge-Transfer Transitions � 121
broader bands compared with sharp intraconfigurational transitions. Second, charge￾transfer bands are blue-shifted with decreasing temperature, and thus decreasing in￾teratomic distances. The latter effect may also be achieved by doping the rare-earth ion
under consideration onto smaller sites resulting in a blue shift of the charge-transfer
band. Vice versa, if doped on larger sites, a red shift is observed. With declining distance,
the effective charge difference—the driving force of charge-transfer transitions—is re￾duced and the energy of the charge-transfer states is elevated. Absolutely remarkable is,
though, that almost regardless of the compound class, the difference of charge-transfer
energies is constant between the lanthanide ions [252, 272]. This merits a closer look
done in the next section after we shed some light on intervalence charge-transfer tran￾sitions in some rare-earth compounds.
If an element adopts different oxidation states within the same compound interva￾lence charge-transfer transitions are possible if the potentials of both overlap. Then an
either thermally or optically activated electron transfer between both ions is feasible.
The resulting potential curves of such IVCT states are very flat and broad. Therefore, also
the absorption bands are expected to be broad. Theoretical calculations suggest that the
IVCT state energy declines with decreasing electronegativity of the anions [273]. This
behavior is the same as discussed for the LMCT transitions as potential curves become
flattened with stronger covalent interactions. In the example of the red-brown mixed￾valent oxide Eu3O4
and the respective black sulphide Eu3
S4
, Mössbauer spectroscopy
confirmed the aforementioned trend. The oxide shows two signals representing distinct
Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions. For the sulphide, only below −60 °C two signals were identified. At
higher temperatures, the electrons are apparently already thermally excited to hop be￾tween adjacent europium atoms with an activation energy around 0.23 eV correspond￾ing to roughly 1,800 cm– 1, well in the infrared regime [274, 275]. Accordingly, this eu￾ropium sulphide is black.
Considering the chemical and physical properties of the rare-earth elements dis￾cussed in the first part of this book, it is not surprising that especially the pair Eu2+/Eu3+
is relevant here. Another pair is Ce3+/Ce4+ for which in the examples of intermediate
oxides between Ce2O3
and CeO2
and the phosphor La(PO4
):Ce3+ IVCT transitions were
successfully assigned [275, 276]. In the latter example, it became clear that the efficiency
of the phosphor is reduced by the presence of significant amounts of Ce4+ if synthe￾sized in air. Even worse, such states may quench luminescence via nonradiative relax￾ation paths. Unfortunately, in doped compounds such transitions are often elusive for
direct measurements because of their extraordinarily broad and flat absorption bands.
But sometimes they provide a possible explanation for unusually broad and red-shifted
emissions [277].

doped compounds. Certainly, they feature indeed bright coloring in the pure europium
compounds [273, 278–281]. Also, the intense yellow color of the mixed valent europium122 � 8 Optical Properties

F—which exclusively contain
divalent europium—may also be yellow. But a diligent look on the reflection spectra
suggests the presence of an IVCT transition in the former example [282, 283].
8.2.3 Optical Electronegativity
The concept of electronegativity is closely related to ioniziation energies and, therefore,
to oxidation and reduction potentials. So, it is not surprising that the charge-transfer
energy relates also to the electronegativity of the ligand from which an electron is trans￾ferred. The higher the electronegativity of a ligand, the lower lie its highest occupied and
especially lowest unoccupied electronic states energetically. Assuming the same cation
as partner, the charge-transfer energy from a more electronegative ligand will be higher
than that of a less electronegative ligand.
The lanthanide halide oxides LnOX crystallize in similar structures (Chapter 6.2.4),
where the R3+ are coordinated by both, oxygen and halide atoms. Therefore, the devel￾opment of the charge-transfer energies can be assessed reliably in these compounds.
Let us assume that a certain ion is doped onto sites coordinated by ligands of different
electronegativity, e. g., Eu3+ with its valence electron configuration 4f6
doped on La3+
sites. In the halide oxides LaOX, the electronegativity of the ligands decreases along the
halide series fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Careful studies show that exactly
the postulated behavior is the outcome with the fluoride showing the highest charge￾transfer energy. The data are depicted in Figure 8.2 where the charge-transfer energies
of lanthanum halide oxides are plotted and illustrated by a blue line.
Figure 8.2: Charge-transfer energies of selected rare-earth halide oxides (left) and charge-transfer shifts
relative to Eu3+ in reverse order to illustrate the trend of optical electronegativities of the R3+ (right); data:
[272, 284].
Let us now assume that Eu3+ ions are doped onto sites of different size. This was done
on the doped chloride oxides ROCl:Eu3+ of lanthanum, gadolinium, yttrium, lutetium
and scandium. Here, the R–Cl and R–O distances shrink smoothly from lanthanum to8.3 The Chemical Shift Model � 123
lutetium, and dramatically to the scandium compound.65 The dramatic effect in ScOCl
is due to a different structure. It adopts the FeOCl structure type in which Sc3+ is sur￾rounded only octahedrally by four oxygen and two chlorine atoms. With decreasing
distances between europium and the ligand atoms the overlap of orbitals is forcibly
increased. You would conclude a stronger covalent interaction with simultaneously in￾creased transfer of electron density from the ligands onto europium. This would reduce
the effective charge difference as well as bring europium somewhat closer to a semifilled
4f shell. Hence, you would expect a growing charge-transfer energy from LaOCl:Eu3+ to
ScOCl:Eu3+—and that is exactly what is observed and obvious from Figure 8.2. Moreover,
the trends within a compound class are the same for all trivalent rare-earth ions. And
additionally, the average differences between the charge-transfer energies of individual
trivalent rare-earth ions are almost the same [252].
These insights opened the opportunity to actually measure the electronegativity of
rare-earth ions by comparing their charge-transfer energies. Jørgensen64 was the person
to condense this into the equation
E
CT
≈ 30,000 cm−1
⋅ {χopt (X) − χopt (M)} (8.4)
where the difference of so-called optical electronegativities of an electronegative part￾ner X and an electropositive partner M yields an excellent guess of the charge-transfer
energy, and vice versa [285]. The given 30,000 cm– 1 correspond to 3.72 eV. Further, the
obtained electronegativities resemble roughly the values of other common electroneg￾ativity scales. Figure 8.2 (right) displays the universally valid averaged differences of
charge-transfer energies with respect to Eu3+ as well as the relative ion-specific optical
electronegativities based on the discussion in [252, 272].
8.3 The Chemical Shift Model
Due to the weak interaction with host structures, the trivalent rare-earth ions behave
almost independently from the local chemical environment. They essentially display
the optical properties discussed later in this chapter. But the energies of their electronic
states relative to the host structure’s band structure is of crucial relevance. If they, for
instance, came to lie close to the conduction or valence band, the rare-earth ion might be
oxidized or reduced easily. Also, the relative position of the 5d states and charge-transfer
states is important.
A typical scenario of rare-earth ions doped into an arbitrary host structure is de￾picted in Figure 8.3. Here, the energies of the ground states of the configurations of the
lanthanide ions are plotted relatively to the conduction and valence bands. For instance,

Figure 8.3: Relative vacuum referred binding energies of the 4f ground states and the 5d states as cal￾culated by the chemical shift model of divalent and trivalent rare-earth ions on an arbitrary example and
scaled with a chemical shift U ≈ 6 eV and a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition (LMCT) for Eu3+ of
approximately 5 eV.
the 4f states of the trivalent ions are given as R3+
4f , and their 5d states are given as R3+
5d.
The excited 4f levels are not shown, but certainly these are present. With the help of the
Dieke diagram, you can assess where the excited 4f levels are. The same is also displayed
for the divalent rare-earth ions. In a typical host structure, such as the halide oxides of
the previous chapter, the states of the ligand atoms form the valence band.
Upon a charge-transfer transition, formally an electron is transferred from a ligand
state onto, e. g., Eu3+. This temporarily yields therefore a Eu2+ ion. Hence, the ligand-to￾metal charge-transfer energy of a trivalent rare-earth ion gives the approximate relative
position of the ground state of its R2+
4f relative to the valence band. This is illustrated in
Figure 8.3 by an orange arrow on the example of europium.
Similarly, the relative energies of the R3+
4f ground states with respect to the bottom of
the conduction band can be estimated from the charge-transfer transitions to the con￾duction band. Here, usually Ce3+, Pr3+ and Tb3+ are favored. Their R3+
4f ground states are
the ones closest to the conduction band. Accordingly, these charge-transfer transitions
are observed at lower energies than for all other R3+
.
As outlined in the previous chapter, the differences between charge-transfer ener￾gies within the same host structure are the same for all rare-earth ions. These considera￾tions in mind, Pieter Dorenbos developed and introduced the basic, highly sophisticated
and theoretically founded chemical shift model. It employs the empiric finding that the
relative energetic setting within a given host structure always follows an at least similar
trend for all rare-earth ions. The energies given within this model are vacuum referred
binding energies. According to this model, the experimentally determined energies of a
single rare-earth ion’s 4f ground state relative to the top of the valence band within a
certain chemical environment directly gives a reliable estimation for those of the other8.3 The Chemical Shift Model � 125
rare-earth ions. For practical reasons, the referred binding energy of the valence elec￾trons of an arbitrary Rz+ with configuration 4fn
is estimated with respect to the anchor
element europium via an on first view complicated equation:
E(R
z+
) = E0
(R
z+
) + Erep(n) ⋅ ξ(n) + U + α(n) ⋅ (rEuz+ − rR
z+ ) (8.5)
Here, E0
(R
z+
) is the basic energy of a valence electron. Then an interelectronic repul￾sion term Erep(n) multiplied with the nephelauxetic ratio (Equation (8.1)) follows; we
recall here that the nephelauxetic ratio describes the decreasing interelectronic repul￾sion within a metal ion with increasing covalency toward a ligand. The chemical shift
parameter U is defined by the energy difference between the 4f ground states of Eu2+
and Eu3+ in a considered host structure given by
E(Eu2+
) − E(Eu3+
) ≡ U. (8.6)
U reflects the different repulsion between the electrons of the ligands and the valence
electrons of Eu3+ and Eu2+, respectively. Typical values were determined to range be￾tween 6 and 8 eV for inorganic solid state compounds. Further, more recent figures and
application examples are discussed in [252, 286, 287]. Finally, the parameter α(n) con￾sidering the lanthanoid contraction is multiplied with the difference of ionic radii, also
relative to the anchor element europium.
All relevant data for such calculations are given in Appendix C. For the understand￾ing, it is crucial to have the different interaction behavior of 5d and 4f states with host
structure bands in mind. 5d states strongly interact and mix with the conduction or va￾lence bands while the 4f states are very well shielded. Thus, in the example depicted in
Figure 8.3, 4f–4f transitions within Gd3+ can be well recorded spectroscopically. The 4f
ground state lies in the valence band, but does not recognize this situation due to the ex￾cellent shielding by the filled 5s2
p
6
shell. In contrast, in this example a 5d←4f excitation
of Yb2+ corresponds to an excitation from the 4f ground state into the conduction band
because of the excellent mixing of 5d(Yb2+) with the conduction band states.
In Chapter 8.5, transitions between excited 5d and 4f ground states will be the center
of interest. Also here, the chemical shift model provides helpful data. It allows the fairly
precise prediction of the energies of 5d relative to the 4f ground states. These show an
astonishingly stable energy difference relative to the well known behavior of the 5d–4f
transitions in Ce3+. So, regarding 5d–4f transitions Ce3+ acts as reference for the trivalent
rare-earth ions and Eu2+ as reference for the divalent ones. These basic figures are given
as E
fd
0
(R
z+
) in Appendix C. In addition, also the red shift of the energy upon interaction
with ligands is the same. Interestingly, the absolute energies of 5d states only vary in
comparably small energy windows below one electron volt. In Chapter 8.7, we will also
dare a closer look on the 5d states as these split into a high-spin and a low-spin branch.
In Figure 8.3, for the heavy lanthanide ions beyond a configuration 4f7
only the most
relevant low-spin branch of the 5d states is depicted, because the transitions from and
to there are spin-allowed.126 � 8 Optical Properties
Apparently, you need some data of a host structure to estimate the optical proper￾ties of rare-earth ions therein. Relevant are the host structure’s band gap, the charge￾transfer energy of Eu3+ to scale the 4f states relative to the valence band, the energy of
the 5d←4f transition in this structure of Ce3+ as well as Eu2+ to scale the 5d states. Fur￾ther relevant are estimates for the nephelauxetic ratio ξ and the chemical shift U. But
also with less data, this model helps to get a good guess, whether certain transitions will
be possible or not. Certainly it delivers interesting empirically obtained basic insights,
which will also help us in the following chapters to understand the luminescence prop￾erties of rare-earth ions. Employing this knowledge, you can develop a feeling which
type of host structure might be interesting for a certain application.
Figure 8.3 implies interesting consequences for transition probabilities of induced
electric dipole transitions. Ions of high optical electronegativity like Eu3+ show a certain
tendency to accept a further electron. Therefore, the charge-transfer states lie relatively
low for trivalent europium. Ions with rather low ionization energies like Eu2+, Ce3+ and
Tb3+ feature relatively low lying 5d states. In cases where states of opposite parity like
charge-transfer or 5d states are quite close to 4f levels significantly higher transition
probabilities can be expected and vice versa. The chemical shift model assists you to
estimate at which energies states of opposite parity can be expected. From these, you
can estimate which 4f levels might mix with these according to Equation (7.19) to give
induced electric dipole transitions. Thus, for ions where both, charge-transfer and 5d
states, are far away from excited 4f states, very low transition probabilities are to be
expected. Both effects are beneficial for respective properties. If you are interested in
comparably efficient 4f–4f emitters, you will preferentially choose ions like Ce3+, Eu3+ or
Tb3+; if you are interested in special emission properties like up-conversion or pumping
of excited states and subsequent stimulated emission, you will choose one of the other
ions like Er3+, Ho3+, Tm3+, Gd3+ and Nd3+ providing low transition probabilities and long
lifetimes of the excited states.
8.4 Emitters Weakly Interacting With Ligands
Based on the principles discussed in Chapter 7.1, the optical properties discussed herein
can be well understood. In this chapter, all relevant trivalent rare-earth ions will be
discussed where the luminescence is dominated by 4f–4f transitions. Since the 4f states
show only weak interactions with any adjacent atom due to strong shielding by the filled
5s2
p
6
shell, this chapter got its title. This weak interaction causes minor radial shifts of
the excited 4f states, low Stokes shifts and comparably high thermal quenching tempera￾tures. The small radial shifts also cause narrow emission bands, almost lines; thus, such
ions are also named line emitters. As a result, the emitted colors are clean, and hence
such emitters are well suited for lamps and monitors, which require three clean color
spots of a red, a blue and a green source. Then they can emit many colors of the visi￾ble spectrum and this as brilliant as possible. Moreover, due to the weak interaction the8.4 Emitters Weakly Interacting With Ligands � 127
emission colors only show marginal dependence from the host structure. For the sake
of exhilaration, I will not only discuss the optical properties of the rare-earth ions but
also do some excursions addressing applications for which the considered element is
specifically interesting—but not necessarily exclusively, of course.
According to the selection rules discussed in Chapters 7.3 and 7.4 f–f transitions
are parity forbidden, many also spin forbidden. The caused low transition probabili￾ties yield pale colors of the compounds containing lanthanide ions—except the cases
where other transitions are at work. These selection rules also cause limited lumines￾cence efficiencies. However, in solids a low symmetric surrounding of such ions may
enable partial mixing of 4f with 5d states resulting in significantly increased transition
probabilities. Hence, in general, host structures providing low symmetric surroundings
are often favored. Since the parity selection rule is based upon the presence of a lo￾cal inversion center, by removing the latter better transition probabilities can be ex￾pected. Thus, host structures without inversion centers are attractive; this is fostered
by the presence of non-centrosymmetric basic building units such as tetrahedra, and
hence host structures containing anionic networks based on tetrahedral building units
are beneficial such as silicate-analogous materials, which I will employ as examples on
several occasions in this book.
The structure of the following chapters follows the principle of spectroscopic twins.
Terms and levels of spectroscopic twins are the same but the levels occur in opposite
order of stability. For instance, Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions are spectroscopic twins. Trivalent
europium has a configuration of [Xe]4f6
, trivalent terbium [Xe]4f14 – 6 equaling [Xe]4f8
.
In the former case, six electrons, and in the latter, six holes occupy the 4f shell. As we
will see, both are related to each other, helping to understand correlations of optical
properties better. Therefore, the following sections start in the center with gadolinium
and end with ytterbium directly leading to the following chapter on cerium.
Our journey starts with those rare-earth ions, which do not show any absorption
or emission in the visible regime as these are suited as host structure cations, notably
La3+, Gd3+, Y3+, Lu3+ and Sc3+ given with decreasing ionic radius. They may be replaced
partially during doping with emitting ions. They are suited as host structure ions be￾cause they can be chosen to fit the size and charge of doped rare-earth ions. This reduces
malevolent defect formation and inadvertent significant host structure distortions. The
stronger the ions differ in size, chemical hardness, and thus chemical and crystallo￾graphic behavior, the higher the risk of separation and a less homogeneous distribution
of doped ions within the material. This would cause higher nonradiative transition rates
and thermal as well as concentration quenching effects.
8.4.1 Gadolinium—Only Partially Innocent
Out of the aforementioned host structure cations, only Gd3+ features 4f–4f transitions
all of which are found in the ultraviolet regime. The reason for the large gap of 32.2 ⋅

in Figure 8.4 is the highly symmetric charge distribution of the exactly half-filled 4f7
shell. Also, a tiny change of the electron distribution like in the first excited state leads
to a considerable drop in stability, and thus rise in energy. Nevertheless, as host structure
cation Gd3+ may act as sensitizer ion absorbing radiation in the ultraviolet regime and
transferring it onto doped ions or to transport energy via its excited 4f band. Although
the transitions are spin and parity forbidden, the sheer mass of absorbers takes care
that incoming radiation can be efficiently absorbed.
Let us look at an example. In GdF3
:Ce3+,Tb3+ even a double energy transfer is em￾ployed to convert mercury plasma radiation into visible light. According to
Hg* ⇃ 254 nm ↾ Ce3+
⇃ 300 nm ↾ Gd3+
⇃ 310 nm ↾ Tb3+
↓ green (8.7)
the emission of a low pressure mercury plasma emission around 254 nm (39.4⋅103
cm– 1)
is absorbed by the efficient 5d←4f transition of doped Ce3+. Trivalent cerium acts as an
antenna here and emits radiation around 300 nm in the u. v. Trivalent gadolinium ions
can absorb a sufficient number of these photons and subsequently supply doped ions
like nearby doped Tb3+ ions with excitation energy. Eventually, the Tb3+ ions emit bright
green luminescence [288].
Also, in the gadolinium silicate Gd2O(SiO4
):Ce3+, a fast scintillation material (see
Chapter 8.5.1), the Gd3+ ions at least contribute to the absorption of the high-energy ra￾diation and their transfer onto the doped Ce3+ ions. You will find more examples and
more details about such antenna phosphors in Chapter 8.4.2.
Thermometry Using Rare-Earth Ions
Regarding thermometry you probably think of mercury thermometers, pyrometers or
thermocouple devices. In this section, we will look at a remote temperature recording8.4 Emitters Weakly Interacting With Ligands � 129
approach based on the principle of the luminescence intensity ratio of two possible emis￾sions. These emissions stem from excited 4f states of neighboring atoms, which are ther￾mally coupled via common ligands. The material hosting these thermosensing atoms has
to stay in close thermal contact with the medium under consideration—for instance, in
biological systems or to monitor catalysis processes. The populations of both emitting
states strive for a thermal equilibrium according to Boltzmann’s law
R21 ∝ exp (−
ΔE21
kBT
) (8.8)
Here, the relative population depends from the energy difference ΔE21 of the two con￾tributing states and the temperature. Since both states may emit, their intensity ratio
resembles the relative population, and thus reveals the local temperature. This equilib￾rium may be achieved via a FRET mechanism (Chapter 7.6) or induced electromagnetic
fields by collectively vibrating surrounding ligands. This equilibration competes with
the emission or other nonradiative relaxation mechanisms. Moreover, the energy differ￾ence between both states determines the temperature range, in which such a Boltzmann
thermometer might take action.
Here, we will take advantage of the fact that excited 4f states feature relatively long
lifetimes since 4f–4f transitions are more or less spin- and parity-forbidden. Especially
trivalent gadolinium is an interesting candidate as there are no intermediate states be￾tween the ground state and the excited states in the ultraviolet regime. Further, they are
sufficiently apart to exclude any thermal interaction between ground and excited states.
According to Figure 8.4, the very first adjacent excited levels of Gd3+
,

P7/2 and 6
P5/2, are
approximately 600 cm– 1 apart, and thus may thermally equilibrate. Following the se￾lection rules (Equations (7.22) and (7.23)), the transitions 6

]:Gd3+, the gadolinium
ions are doped on the yttrium sites of a silicate-analogous borosulfate, where the cations
are coordinated by sulfate tetrahedra, which themselves are covalently bound to borate
tetrahedra. The tetrahedra of the anion may provide vibrational modes in the desired
region of 600 cm– 1. As derived in Chapter 6.5, these anions exhibit only a weak coordi￾nation strength. Nevertheless, this is apparently sufficient to ensure fast thermal equili￾bration between the gadolinium ions. Their local surrounding shows no symmetry and
this prevents further symmetry-based selection rules. The excitation occurs from the

which are of comparable speed of the states in Gd3+ [291].
8.4.2 Terbium—Bright Green or Also Blue?
The ground state configuration of trivalent terbium ions is [Xe]4f8
, just one electron
above the very stable half-filled 4f shell. Therefore, its ionization energy is rather low as
the terbium ions strive for a half-filled 4f shell either in Tb4+ or by excitation to a 4f7
5d1
state. This is reflected nicely in Figure 8.3 where the 4f ground state 7
F6
lies at consid￾erably higher energy than that of the neighboring Gd3+. Since the 5d states of both ions
are of similar energy, those of terbium are now located comparably close to the ground
state. In the compound featured in this chapter, Y2

cm– 1) as shown in
Figure 8.5 [292]. These transitions enable parity-allowed excitation via 4f7

tran￾sitions. Because of the efficient absorption around 254 nm, also Tb3+ can be excited in
applications like compact fluorescent lamps via the main emission line of a low pres￾sure mercury plasma. Host structures doped with Tb3+ are colorless like terbium salts
and show a bright green luminescence upon excitation in the ultraviolet regime. The lu￾minescence is based on four dominant emission lines from the first excited state 5D4
to
the ground state multiplet 7

(J = 3 . . . 6) represented by the green arrows in Figure 8.5.
Apparently, Tb3+ does not actually emit a really clean green stemming from a single
emission band, but bluish and yellowish side-bands yield something whitish, thus caus￾ing in total a bright green emission. This holds for doping concentrations above a few
percent, which are necessary for a reasonable light output in the mentioned applications
like compact fluorescent lamps for lighting.

Cross Relaxation
After excitation by ultraviolet radiation the terbium ions relax fast to the excited 5D3
level. From there, direct emission is possible to the ground state multiplet. This competes
with a nonradiative relaxation to the excited 5D4
state, though; this relaxation is fostered
by a so-called cross relaxation with a neighboring Tb3+ in its ground state. Such energy
transfers according to

follow a FRET mechanism via a resonant interaction, and thus occur below an average
interatomic distance of typically 4 Å (Chapter 7.6). At low concentrations, the average
distances between adjacent Tb3+ ions are too large for an efficient cross-relaxation. Then
also blue emissions from the 5D3
level may be recorded as depicted in Figure 8.5 where
the cross-relaxation transitions are marked by the red broken arrows.
Such relaxation is a type of concentration quenching of certain optical transitions
and can be observed, if the energy gap between the excited states matches that between
the ground state and a suited twin state. The critical concentration, above which only the
green emissions of Tb3+ can be monitored depends from the average Tb-Tb distance and
from the strength of interaction with the ligands—which is very weak in this compound
here. A further example of cross-relaxation will be mentioned in the next chapter on
Eu3+ ions.
Sensitized Luminescence—Antenna Phosphors
There are several ions featuring desired emission wavelengths for certain applications,
but they unfortunately lack an appropriate efficiency due to the circumstance that their
excitation and emission transitions are more or less forbidden. To overcome this prob￾lem, several decades ago sensitized luminescence was discovered and since then thor￾oughly investigated.
As you know from previous chapters, trivalent rare-earth ions normally show 4f–
4f transitions, which are forbidden regarding the parity and may be even forbidden
regarding the spin selection rule. In the case of Eu3+, we will see that here at least an
efficient excitation via a charge-transfer transition might help, and in the case of Tb3+
allowed 5d←4f excitations are feasible. Both efficient excitations only help for a certain
application if the light source provides the necessary excitation wavelength. In many
other cases, neither charge-transfer nor 5d←4f excitations are available; hence, here
arises the need for alternative excitations via efficient absorbers, namely sensitizers,
situated nearby the emitting ion and capable of transferring the absorbed energy onto
the activator. Application of this approach is found in lanthanide complexes. There, lig￾ands act as the antenna, which contain aromatic groups with a broad absorption band
in the u. v. region. Upon excitation, this antenna transfers the energy onto the emitter as
discussed earlier. Due to this antenna effect, the phosphors discussed here are also called132 � 8 Optical Properties

antenna phosphors. The great advantage of complexes is that the absorption of the an￾tenna ligand can be tuned very finely via selective substitutions within the organic part.
Unfortunately, these organic parts make them less stable against higher temperatures
and also lead to typically lower thermal quenching temperatures. For many examples
and a thorough discussion on such antenna complexes I recommend [294]. Here, we will
continue with a purely inorganic solid antenna phosphor.
The principles are basically the same as depicted in Figure 8.6. Here, in Na5
Tb(WO4
)
4
the omnipresent tungstate anions can be efficiently excited via a charge-transfer tran￾sition. From there, three relaxation mechanisms compete. Either, it shows the shown
broad-band emission of tungstate or it relaxes somehow radiationless back to its ground
state. As a third possibility, Tb3+ offers suitedly lying excited states for a resonant energy
transfer (FRET, see also Chapter 7.6). As both ions, WO2 –
4
and Tb3+, are usually in direct
neighborhood, this transfer can become very efficient yielding the bright green lumi￾nescence known for trivalent terbium ions. This is shown nicely in Figure 8.6 where in
the (green) emission spectrum upon excitation via the charge-transfer transition around
256 nm only 5D4→7

transitions can be monitored. In contrast, if the same compound
is directly excited into the level 5D3 with u. v. light around 377 nm, also weak but signif￾icant emissions in the blue occur. The absolute intensity of the green emission curve is
by far stronger than that of the blue curve; this can be deduced from the ratio of the
intensities at 256 and 377 nm in the excitation spectrum. In Na5
Tb(WO4
)
4
, certainly the
LMCT states of tungstate overlap with the 5d states of terbium to some extent. Further
investigations on the yttrium compound show that the lifetime of the LMCT state de￾creases upon slight doping with Tb3+. Moreover, investigations on such phosphors with
the same host structure, but larger cations like lanthanum can establish the expected in￾tensity decay with increasing average distance between the donor WO2 –
4
and the doped
activator Tb3+. One of the very first intentionally and successfully doped tungstates was8.4 Emitters Weakly Interacting With Ligands � 133

(WO6
):Eu3+ by Blasse66 in 1966 [295]. In the following paragraph, selected further ex￾amples are discussed.
Tuning the absorption wavelength is somewhat tricky in solids, so the diversity is
surely more slender; in contrast, thermal quenching may occur at higher temperatures
in solids. Of course, there are prominent examples for phosphors like the pair Sb3+/Mn2+
where the efficient 5p←5s transition of antimony acts as antenna for the parity and spin￾forbidden 3d→3d transitions within divalent manganese. The slightly different chemical

(OH,Cl):Sb,Mn [296] allow to employ the different nephelauxetic effect on
the absorption and emission of Sb3+. In the latter, the weaker nephelauxetic effect yields
a blue shifted emission. Also, in the latter the ligand field splitting is smaller and yields
a blue shifted emission of the 3d5
ion Mn2+
.
67
Divalent manganese ions can also be sensitized via codoping with divalent eu￾ropium ions. The thorough discussion of the optical properties of Eu2+ will be the topic
of Chapter 8.5. In short, Eu2+ is normally excited via allowed 5d←4f transitions and
shows also efficient emissions of the same type. It is also capable of transferring the
excitation at least partially onto Mn2+, which has been proven on many examples such
as the polyphosphate α-Sr[PO3
]
2
:Eu,Mn. There the combination of both, the europium
and manganese based emissions, yield white fluorescence comprising a blue emission
due to the 5d→4f transition of Eu2+ and an orange-red 3d→3d one of Mn2+ [297]. Both
ions herein are typically doped with concentrations of 1 % for the—compared with
Sr2+—slightly larger Eu2+ and 4 % for clearly smaller Mn2+. As mentioned before, the
interatomic distance is crucial for an efficient energy transfer. Statistically, it is not very
likely to find manganese and europium ions in a close neighborhood. Luckily, it was
proven on codoped potassium chloride, KCl:Eu,Mn, by electron spin resonance that in
highly symmetric arrangements of ions apparently a pairing of the introduced doped
ions occurs. This minimizes the overall loss of lattice energy [298]. The same can be
assumed for α-Sr[PO3
]
2
, which is based on a diamond-like, and hence quite symmetric,
arrangement of strontium. So, this approach is more promising than to offer distinct
sites fitting the sizes of both ions. In summary, in an ideal case you need allowed tran￾sitions for the sensitizer who transfers the energy completely onto the activator with
both being adjacent to each other. Allowed transitions are charge-transfer transitions

8.4.3 Europium—Sometimes Hypersensitive
Trivalent europium ions are spectroscopically the twins of Tb3+. While the latter come
with a surplus electron with regard to the particularly stable half-filled 4f shell, the for￾mer lack one with its ground state configuration [Xe]4f6
. The energetic consequences
are opposite since Eu3+ strives for a further electron, maybe supplied by an efficient
charge-transfer transition. And indeed, trivalent europium features the lowest charge￾transfer energies, and thus the lowest optical electronegativity of all trivalent rare-earth
ions (Figure 8.7).

splitting of all terms and levels results. Like trivalent terbium, also Eu3+ is subject to
cross-relaxation. After excitation via a charge-transfer transition or direct excitation of
higher 4f states, e. g., the cross-relaxations

down to the 7

levels of the ground state, typically causing an orange-red color impres￾sion of the emission. Among these, the basically forbidden 0 → 0 transition is some￾times hard to observe. Nevertheless, this transition is very useful as it is never split
(J = 0). Therefore, the number of observed bands corresponds to the number of different
chemical environments for trivalent europium in the sample. The magnetic dipole tran￾sition 5D0→7

can be taken as a reference against the so-called hypersensitive 5D0→7

transition; see the respective special chapter on this topic below. The transitions visible

are not 5d-4f transitions.
As mentioned above, Eu3+ features the lowest charge-transfer transition energies
of all rare-earth ions due to the proximity of its configuration to the stable half-filled
4f shell. As outlined in Chapter 8.2, the energies lie around the famous 254 nm (approx￾imately 39.4 ⋅ 103
cm−1
) emission of mercury plasma, which makes Eu3+ an important
dopant for phosphors of respective lamps as discussed later in this chapter. The sim￾ple correlation of charge-transfer energies derived from Figure 8.3 allows also to esti￾mate whether trivalent europium can be reliably doped into a certain host structure
despite its limited chemical stability or if it presumably becomes reduced to the diva￾lent state. This occurs if the estimated charge-transfer energy lies below 2.5 eV—which
consequently depends from the electronegativity of the ligands [272]. Another aspect to
be taken into account is that due to the low lying charge-transfer states also the thermal
quenching temperatures of phosphors based on Eu3+ may be relatively low. The charge￾transfer band of our example Eu2

corresponds with the experience that with decreasing average distance to the ligands
the charge-transfer energy increases (Chapter 8.2). Since trivalent europium is one of
the spectroscopically best investigated ions, a lot of literature is available. For a concise
and helpful overview, I recommend [239].
Hypersensitive Transitions
Essentially, pure 4f–4f transitions are forbidden due to the parity selection rule. Accord￾ingly, no electric dipole and only magnetic dipole transitions would be expected for the
rare-earth ions discussed in this chapter; but also lined out earlier, low symmetric coor￾dination lacking inversion symmetry gives rise for the so-called induced electric dipole
transitions because under these symmetry conditions mixing with other states of differ￾ent parity is feasible [301, 302]. Among these, hypersensitive transitions react especially
sensitive—as the name implies—to the lack of local inversion symmetry, which fosters
the intensity of such transitions by up to two orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, the
reasons that make these transitions so special are not as yet fully understood and are
still subject of scientific discussion. From the latter, we may conclude that there are more
factors influencing the intensity of such transitions maybe adding up or even promot￾ing mutually. Below, I will mention relevant aspects of the ongoing discussion. Anyhow,
there is consensus about the empirically determined selection rules for transitions being
possibly hypersensitive:
ΔS = 0 ΔL ≤ 2 ΔJ ≤ 2 (8.12)
Accidentally, these selection rules resemble those of electric quadrupole transitions, but
since such transitions are extremely weak ones, this presumably is indeed accidental.
Nevertheless, you might sometimes come across the labeling pseudo quadrupole transi￾tion.
Most people hear about the concept of hypersensitive transitions for the first time
when they face luminescence of Eu3+ where in every emission spectrum the prominent
hypersensitive transition 5D0→7
F2
occurs. Certainly, also the respective excitation tran￾sition 5D0←7
F2
is hypersensitive and should be discussed as it is frequently employed as
in situ probe for local inversion symmetry. This is done by comparing the intensities of
this transition and the 5D0→7
F1
transition, which is a purely magnetic dipole transition
and can thus act as a good reference. Moreover, several of such transitions have been
identified for the trivalent rare-earth ions as listed in Table 8.2. Indeed, the aforemen￾tioned 5D0→7
F2
transitions of Eu3+ are the most investigated and for certain reasons
most employed hypersensitive transitions. Within the Judd–Ofelt theory (Chapter 7.8)
for this specific transition only U
2
is nonzero according to the tabulated figures of U
λ
, so
Ω2 determines the intensity of the transition [258]. A wider view shows that this holds not
only here, but generally for hypersensitive transitions, since the ligand impact declines
from Ω2 via Ω4
to Ω6
[303]. While the squared matrix elementsU

interelectronic interactions within the levels of the rare-earth ion under consideration,
the intensity parameters Ωλ
represent physically the square of the charge displacement
due to the induced electric dipole transition and mathematically the radial part of the
wave function (Chapter 7.8). Accordingly, the latter are influenced by the surrounding
in terms of symmetry and polarization.
On the other hand, you cannot neglect the respective squared reduced matrix el￾ement U
λ
as this apparently determines the sensitivity toward any symmetry change,
which allows to override the parity selection rule and is a measure for miscibility with
states of opposite parity. Accordingly, it is not further surprising that high values here
are beneficial for hypersensitive transitions, already noted by Judd [253].
Jørgensen and Judd found a correlation between hypersensitive behavior and an
inhomogeneous dielectric environment of the respective rare-earth ion caused by an
asymmetric arrangement of dipoles [301]. They concluded that this surrounding may
lead to strongly enhanced pseudo quadrupole transitions. Judd later added certain sym￾metry restrictions. Also, a nexus to the basicity of the ligands was identified and dis￾cussed [303]. This seems quite reasonable as this approach, known also as covalency
model, identifies charge-transfer states as a further contributing factor. Their intensity
grows with a decreasing energy difference between the forbidden 4f–4f and the allowed
charge-transfer transitions.138 � 8 Optical Properties
The dynamic coupling model or ligand polarization model was developed by Mason68
and extends the static coupling model, i. e., the Judd–Ofelt theory. There the ligands are
assumed to be passive (or static) with regard to dynamics of charge distribution within
the rare-earth ion upon excitation. Here, in this theory these dynamics induce electric
dipoles on the individual ligands—they are polarized. In turn, the dynamics foster the
probabilities of transitions forbidden due to the parity selection rule [304, 305]. Accord￾ing to this theory, such polarization effects contribute only to Ω2
if an inversion center
is absent and are stronger the higher the polarizability of the ligands is.
Unfortunately, to all of these rules and theories exceptions or arguments were found
which not necessarily falsify these hypotheses but make clear that at least many of these
aspects may contribute to the hypersensitivity of transitions. But none of them is solely
capable of explaining the phenomenon. Eventually, not even the same Ω2 value of any
two Eu3+ emission spectra yield the same intensities of the hypersensitive transitions.
Therefore, it was postulated that also the refractive index n may play a role since a grow￾ing n seems to correlate with higher intensities [306].
Compact Fluorescent Lamps
During the mid-19th century, and during the same time when the incandescent light bulb
was developed, many people experimented with electricity driven lighting approaches.
After evacuating glass tubes and applying high electric tension on both ends, the tube lit
up—and the Geissler69 tube was born. The Geissler tube was a gas-discharge lamp filled
with neon, air or mercury. Today we still use this concept in a slightly modified form
in compact fluorescent lamps, also called energy saving lamps. This name implies that it
consumes less electricity compared with incandescent light bulbs and this is indeed the
case. Out of one watt, a light bulb generates approximately 2 % visible light, correspond￾ing to a luminous efficacy of 15 lumen per watt. The same energy employed in a fluo￾rescent tube yields approximately 100 lumen per watt or an efficiency of up to roughly
20 %. White light emitting diodes manage even more, up to 40 %. These will be discussed
in Chapter 8.6. Nowadays fluorescent tubes are still driven by a low-pressure mercury
plasma. Each tube contains a few miligrams of the toxic metal, which upon switching on
forms a plasma. Mercury was chosen due to its high energy conversion efficiency of 75 %
into u. v. light with three main emissions around 185, 254 and 365 nm [307]. To get white
light out of the tube, a manifold of phosphors was developed with excellent absorption
around the main line of 254 nm. Such lamps are normally designed on a three-color￾band concept, where phosphors emit mainly three colors red, green and blue adding up
to white—according to Figure 8.25 in Chapter 8.6. A typical emission spectrum is shown
in Figure 8.9 besides a schematic picture of such an energy saving lamp. A compact

assigned to rare-earth ions and mercury plasma.
fluorescent tube consists of a glass tube containing the mercury. The tube is coated on
the inner surface with a phosphor mixture. These phosphors convert the u. v. light as
completely as possible into visible light. A typical phosphor coating consists of red emit￾ting Y2O3
:Eu3+ (YOX), green emitting La(PO4
):Ce3+,Tb3+ (LAP) and Ce[MgAl11O19]:Tb3+
(CAT) as well as blue emitting Ba[MgAl10O17]:Eu2+ (BAM). Frequently, besides these rare￾earth based phosphors also halophosphates like Ca5
(PO4
)
3
(F,Cl):Sb3+,Mn2+ are employed
which contribute broader bands in the blue and orange regime [93]. Coming back to
the emission spectrum depicted in Figure 8.9, the relevant emissions of the contributing
rare-earth ions can be identified. Apparently, there is a preference for Tb3+, contributing
in particular green light, Eu3+, contributing red light, and Eu2+, contributing blue light to
the in total white emission. The trivalent ions thereby show the emissions already dis￾cussed. The very versatile divalent europium is employed here with a famous phosphor
described in the course regarding the 5d–4f emitters in Chapter 8.5.2.
To convert the plasma’s u. v. light as efficiently as possible, terbium is sensitized by
trivalent cerium ions, which feature broad-banded 5d←4f excitations. This absorbed
energy can then be transferred onto the doped trivalent terbium ions according to a
FRET mechanism. For a thorough understanding on the principles of such antenna phos￾phors, a glance into Chapter 8.4.2 is recommended. Trivalent europium is the emitter of
choice for the red emission because the efficient ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transi￾tion in oxidic environments manifests itself in a broad excitation band around the main
mercury plasma emission at 254 nm. Finally, Eu2+ is efficiently excited via allowed and
broadbanded 5d←4f excitations. Thus, at least the excitation path is solved efficiently
for the employed emitters fostering a quite reasonable overall energy efficiency.
To get rid of the toxic mercury, alternate plasma generating elements such as
xenon are feasible. Unfortunately, the excitation occurs at clearly higher energies in
the vacuum u. v. regime, which then requires a higher energy efficiency of the em￾ployed phosphors—and here quantum cutting comes into play, which is treated later in
Chapter 8.4.9.
Although the fluorescent lamps emit white light, this white light does not fully re￾semble that of the black body radiator. Therefore, it is recognized as deficient and col￾ored objects might look different under illumination compared with incandescent light140 � 8 Optical Properties
bulbs or high quality white light LEDs. An application where distinctly colored emissions
are a compulsory requirement are plasma display panels.
Plasma Display Panels
For quite a time, plasma display panels (PDPs) were commercially used for flat, large
televisions until the first decade of our century. They were quickly replaced by brighter
and overall cheaper concepts such as liquid-crystal displays and OLED screens needing
less energy for operation. Nevertheless, a few remarks should be made here on PDPs,
especially because this technology is closely related to fluorescent tubes and may de￾liver interesting ideas for possible future applications. In PDPs, normally a noble gas
plasma like xenon was employed, which upon ignition emits in the VUV regime with
two prominent emissions at 147 and 172 nm. Each pixel comprises a plasma chamber
coated with a phosphor emitting the respective color. Certainly, also these phosphors
had to absorb efficiently in the VUV and to emit as fast as possible to avoid ghostly im￾ages. Therefore, the host structures need large band gaps, and the phosphors require
very efficient and allowed emissions [307, 308]. Accordingly, most of the inorganic phos￾phors are colorless, thus a coating looks whitish. This is a disadvantage for a display,
which requires a dark background of the nonilluminated pixels. For this purpose, col￾ored phosphors were developed carrying a dark body color such as the red emitting
red powder of Zr(SiO4
):Pr3+,Pr4+,P5+ discussed in Chapter 8.4.9 or the blue emitting blue
phosphor BAM:Eu2+,Co2+, i. e., Ba[MgAl10O17]:Eu2+,Co2+, where blue cobalt ions achieve
the same effect [309]. Moreover, the strong VUV irradiation led to the decomposition of
phosphors. Consequently, the image burn-in was a big problem. Here, long-term display
of a certain image yielded persisting shadow images.
8.4.4 Samarium and Burning Holes
The electronic configuration of trivalent samarium ions is [Xe]4f5
. It features the same
states like the smaller Dy3+ but with opposite order and a smaller splitting. According to
its configuration, Sm3+ shows only a weak tendency to get reduced to the divalent state—
and thus features high lying charge-transfer states. Moreover, it also shows only a weak
tendency to get oxidized—thus the 5d states are situated at high energies. This can also
be concluded from the chemical shift model; see Figure 8.3. Both tendencies lead to lower
probabilities of mixing with states of opposite parity according to the Judd–Ofelt theory
(Chapter 7.8) and subsequently to low transition probabilities. Moreover, the emission
spectra like that depicted in Figure 8.10 show a manifold of lines in the visible regime and
normally do not comprise clean colors preventing it from many applications—unlike the
prominent red line in Eu3+ or the green emission of Tb3+
.
Due to the absorptions in the violet-blue regime, solutions containing Sm3+ look yel￾lowish, certainly pale as the transition probabilities are low. The special situation of8.4 Emitters Weakly Interacting With Ligands � 141

data: [293].
Sm3+, somehow undecided between being reduced and being oxidized easily, makes it
attractive for permanent data storage based on spectral hole burning as discussed in the
following paragraph.
Spectral Hole Burning
Spectral hole burning may sound somewhat weird, but it describes the approach to save
information employing the excitation of absorbing or luminescent ions, such as trivalent
samarium. In any material, any excitation band of transition metal or rare-earth ions
shows a certain width caused by thousands of slightly different local surroundings or
interactions with adjacent doped ions. To minimize vibrational broadening, the samples
are normally cooled. The observed band with its inhomogeneous linewidth comprises
the slightly different extremely sharp individual absorptions of all ions of homogeneous
linewidth as depicted schematically in Figure 8.10. The ratio of inhomogeneous to homo￾geneous widths within an absorption band typically spans several orders of magnitude,
values of six are mentioned in literature. If an individual ion is excited by a laser beam,
it leaves behind a tiny, local but recordable dip in the absorption band at the wavelength
and with a depth proportional to the intensity of the laser beam, which may be regarded
as a bit. Thus, at a specific spot more than one bit may be saved by employing a tunable
laser beam and different beam intensities. The local width of the bit is determined by
the size of the beam. In total, optical data densities up to terabits per square centimeter
are imaginable [310].
Several materials and ions were investigated, e. g., Y2
(SiO4
)O:Er3+, where the ratios
of inhomogeneous to homogeneous widths amounts to more than 10,000. The problem
here is the lifetime of the stored bit as after excitation trivalent erbium relaxes quite
fast to the ground state. If you now imagine an ion, which might be ionized temporarily,
so that the excited electron is trapped in more or less shallow traps in the conduction
band, this information will be stored permanently as long as you would not release the
trapped electron by suited radiation. Such an ion should be relatively stable in two ox￾idation states—not switch too easily, though. Further, it should certainly tend to very142 � 8 Optical Properties
sharp individual absorptions like a 4f–4f absorber. The samarium ions Sm2+ and Sm3+
fulfill these preconditions—like Pr3+/Pr4+ or Eu2+/Eu3+
.
Accordingly, a host structure like BaFCl is doped with divalent samarium ions. BaFCl
is suited because it tends to the formation of many defects on the halide sites. It adopts
the structure of matlockite, PbFCl, and comprises layers of fluorine and chlorine. This
will be also subject of the next chapter on long lasting luminescence. Initially, BaFCl
is doped with the stable Sm3+ ones, which are subsequently reduced by irradiation
with ionizing radiation like X-rays. The generated excited electrons in the conduction
band are transferred onto the Sm3+ ions, which are then locally reduced to the diva￾lent state. Moreover, the barium ions in BaFCl may be replaced by strontium ions to
generate a broader spectrum of different local surroundings. This gives rise for signif￾icant inhomogeneous line broadening of the typically 0.2 % doped Sm2+ ions. It can be
further enhanced by doping nanosized crystals of systematically tuned compositions

of Sm2+

Sm2+ is isoelectronic with Eu3+. Compared with Eu3+, where this 5D0→7
F0
transition
occurs below 600 nm, the emission is recorded at significantly lower energies for Sm2+
,
peaking around 690 nm; this is due to the lower nuclear charge leading to a relative
expansion of the isoelectronic ion and accordingly smaller splitting of all states. Due to
better mixing with states of opposite parity, this transition is quite intense in divalent
samarium. And it is not split—we recall the short discussion in the chapter on Eu3+. So,
every slightly different local surrounding generates its own sharp emission. As depicted
in Figure 8.10, all these emissions sum up to a broader hat-shaped band out of which
upon laser radiation dips of different depth are taken out—or holes are burnt [310].
8.4.5 Dysprosium—As Long-Lasting as Possible
The electronic configuration of trivalent dysprosium ions is [Xe]4f9
and accordingly cor￾responds via 4f14 – n to that of its spectroscopic twin Sm3+ (4f5
) with just reversed order
of levels but the same order of terms. The series of weak absorptions in the blue and u. v.
regime (Figure 8.11) yields a pale yellowish color of the ions. Compared with Sm3+, the
same transitions occur in dysprosium at higher energies (see Figure 8.10) reflecting the
higher nuclear charge here. The luminescence of three transitions in the visible regime
by Dy3+ adds up to a whitish or yellowish color impression.
Long Persistent Luminescence
Introduction and Safety Application
For safety applications, like the power-independent marking of emergency routes in
buildings, you need phosphors, which are ideally excited during daytime and show a
long visible emission. Then during night-time or when it is dark, the signs can be read.8.4 Emitters Weakly Interacting With Ligands � 143
Figure 8.11: Term scheme of trivalent dysprosium with an excitation (green), relaxation (red) and the emis￾sions in the emission spectrum (orange); right: reflection (green), excitation (black, monitored at 573 nm)
and emission spectra (orange, excited with 350 nm) of DyH[PO3
]

; data: [230].
Such phosphors are called long persistent phosphors and they are applicable in several
fields. Besides the application as safety signs, they are also employed for the detection
and quantification of high-energy radiation such as X-rays or u. v. light.
To illustrate the principle, I will focus on a long persistent phosphor employed for
marking of emergency routes, and here eventually trivalent dysprosium ions will come
into play. For this application, a bright green emission is desired since the human eye
is most sensitive in the green regime. Moreover, it is believed that green yields an addi￾tional soothing effect. A famous green phosphor showing afterglow—another phrase for
persistent luminescence—is Sr[Al2O4
]:Eu2+ where divalent europium ions are doped on
Sr2+ sites embedded in a silicon dioxide type network structure comprising AlO4
tetra￾hedra [311]. Further details of the luminescence will be discussed in Chapter 8.5.2; the
structure was already described in Chapter 6.5.3.
To explain the afterglow effect, several mechanisms have been suggested, some of
which appear to be improbable as they propose the participation of Eu+
species, for
instance. The in-conclusion most reasonable explanations so far consider the nature of
electron traps and their role in the mechanism of long persistent luminescence [312–316].
Accordingly, in pure Sr[Al2O4
] and Sr[Al2O4
]:Eu2+ presumably exclusively oxygen va￾cancies act as traps. The depth of such traps can be evaluated by thermoluminescence
measurements. Hereby the sample is irradiated during cooling to temperatures, which
prevent the thermal release of the excited electrons. Subsequently, the sample is slowly
heated, the emission spectra are recorded simultaneously, certainly without further ex￾citation. This method can also be used to evaluate the age of ancient fireplaces by ana￾lyzing the thermoluminescence of stones featuring color centers filled by radiation over
time. For problems and practical aspects of evaluating thermoluminescence measure￾ments, refer to [315].
The basic persistent luminescence mechanism as displayed in Figure 8.12 starts with
optical excitation of the activator, here Eu2+, from its ground state of [Xe]4f7
configura￾tion (8
S7/2) beyond the excited states into the conduction band of the host (blue arrow)144 � 8 Optical Properties

.
giving a quite freely moving electron and a hole—Eu3+. Although there is some discus￾sion whether the transfer occurs via the conduction band or directly, the evidence is
more on the former side. The excited electron can then be trapped in a nearby oxygen
vacancy T+

on the depth of the vacancy potential this electron will then be released thermally or

(8.14)
For applications around room temperature, trap depths of approximately 0.6 eV are
ideal as then the smooth thermal release of the trapped electrons occurs. If released, the
electron finds an aforementioned Eu3+ hole where it yields an excited Eu2+ ion, which
eventually emits the green photon around a wavelength of 520 nm upon relaxation to
the ground state (green arrow). As the thermal excitation from traps only occurs sponta￾neously and strongly depends from the temperature, the emission might be delayed for
many hours. The intensity and duration of this persistent luminescence depends from
the number and the trap depth of the vacancies. The former can be increased signifi￾cantly by doping with ions on the metal site with a differing and stable charge, such as
Dy3+
.
70 To avoid afterglow effects, phosphors for other applications are subsequently annealed under a
suited atmosphere to heal these defects.8.4 Emitters Weakly Interacting With Ligands � 145
Dysprosium suits well for this role as the trivalent state is very stable. A reduc￾tion to the divalent or oxidation to the tetravalent state proves to be challenging. Thus,
the charge introduced—with all consequences for a desired defect formation—will not
be affected by surplus or lack of electrons. In Sr[Al2O4
]:Eu2+,Dy3+, two doped Dy3+ re￾place three Sr2+ ions, and apparently cause even more oxygen defects around the vacant
cation sites. Presumably, most importantly for the long persistency of the luminescence,
the Dy3+ ions stabilize the oxygen vacancies due to their higher charge and increased
U. For the time being, it remains unclear whether here exclusively oxygen vacancies
as proposed by Aitasalo or also dysprosium traps forming intermediately Dy2+ as sug￾gested by Dorenbos contribute; but this latter detail does not actually abate the basic
understanding of these phosphors. Moreover, even if excited somehow, Dy3+ also emits
greenish and yellowish light, typically around 572 nm, enhancing the luminescence fur￾ther. Certainly, also in the polyanion doping with fluorine or by partial replacement of
aluminium by—for instance—boron, which can also be happy with only three adjacent
oxygen atoms, is feasible to increase the number of defects on oxygen sites.
Such phosphors releasing the trapped energy smoothly over time by thermal activa￾tion may also be employed for photocatalysts to enable catalysis also in a dark setting. If
the emitted wavelength peaks in the biologically transparent window between 650 and
1350 nm, also an application as detector for bioimaging and biodetection is feasible as
here a high-intensity irradiation to release the trapped electrons can be avoided [317].
Application as Detector Material
Another prominent application of long-lasting luminescence is the quantitative record￾ing of radiation such as X-rays in detectors of diffractometers or medicine. For this pur￾pose, the trap depth is slightly deeper to prevent thermal relaxation. A material of choice
is BaFBr:Eu2+ where the trap depth U in Figure 8.12 is reported to be around 2 eV [318].
The doped Eu2+ ions are excited with energies above 6 eV (approx. 200 nm) to yield
Eu3+ and a nearby trapped electron. The latter is released during read-out employing
a red laser with 2 eV energy and then recombines with Eu3+ to give an excited Eu2+
.
Via allowed 5d1

transitions, a blue-violet emission around 3.2 eV (approximately
400 nm) will be recorded—and the stronger the emission intensity here, the stronger
the irradiation by an X-ray diffracted beam was at this considered spot. Such—very
sensitive—detectors are named imaging plate detector (IPD) or imaging plate detector
system (IPDS).
8.4.6 Holmium—A Chameleon
Holmium compounds frequently show an interesting color change effect when watched
under daylight where they look pale yellowish and pink under the artificial light of flu￾orescent lamps, for instance. Therefore, it might be named a chameleon. This inter-146 � 8 Optical Properties
esting behavior will be discussed in the second part of this chapter. As the 5d states
lie at very high energies in the vacuum ultraviolet regime, holmium does not show
any 5d←4f absorptions very well deduced from the chemical shift model in Figure 8.3.
The charge-transfer transitions are found at even higher energies than the 5d states.
Both confirm the high stability of the electronic configuration of [Xe]4f10 of trivalent
holmium ions. The transitions between the terms depicted in Figure 8.13 feature ac￾cordingly only low transition probabilities for induced electric dipole 4f–4f transitions.
Among these, the transitions 5G6←5

and 3H6←5

are hypersensitive (Chapter 8.4.3),
which were recorded as intense absorption bands in the depicted spectra around 360
and 450 nm. Since Ho3+ shows low transition probabilities, the lifetime of excited states
is long opening the door for applications based on optically pumped states, such as solid
state lasers (Chapter 8.4.8) or up-conversion phosphors (Chapter 8.4.7).

Alexandrite Effect
The Alexandrite effect occurs if a solid shows different appearance under illumination
with different light sources. Historically, this effect was named after tsar Alexander
II, who reigned from 1855 to 1881. In the 1840s, the mineral alexandrite was discov￾ered, namely a chrysoberyl of the composition BeAl2O4
:Cr3+; it looks greenish under
daylight and reddish under campfire. The reason for this behavior are two strong ab￾sorption bands of the doped chromium ions peaking in the blue and yellow regime of
visible light. While the emission of the sun—approximated as a black body radiator of
5500 °C—peaks in the green, the visible emission of campfire—a black body radiator of
roughly 1200 °C—lies in the red. Consequently, the human eye, more sensitive to green
than to red light, recognizes the dominating green reflection or transmission under day￾light. Under the light of a campfire, the human eye gets a reddish color impression. To8.4 Emitters Weakly Interacting With Ligands � 147
end this story, one should know that the colors of the imperial army of that time were
green and red, so the discovered mineral was named after the tsar.
A similar color changing effect can be monitored for many compounds containing
trivalent holmium ions if watched under daylight and the light of a fluorescent lamp.
This can be well understood by looking at the absorption spectrum of Ho3+ ions and the
emission spectrum of a fluorescent lamp shown in Figure 8.13. Apparently, the green
emission of the fluorescent lamp around 550 nm is absorbed by the intense (5
F4
,
5
S2
)←5
I
8
transition. Accordingly, mainly the remaining lines in the blue and red regime yield the
purple color impression of Ho3+ ions. Under sunlight, which consists of a continuous
spectrum peaking in the green regime, the absorptions cause a yellow color appear￾ance. The emissions of the fluorescent lamp are, by the way, dominated by emissions of
rare-earth ions and are assigned in Figure 8.9 in Chapter 8.4.3. Such Alexandrite effects
occur in every case where several absorptions in the visible regime selectively efface
emissions of a light source as in the case of compounds containing Nd3+ where the color
impression varies from reddish via purple to bluish.
8.4.7 Erbium—Putting Photons Together
Trivalent erbium ions usually form pink salts, and with their electronic configuration
[Xe]4f11 they are like the holmium and dysprosium ones that are very stable, which is
reflected in their intermediate optical electronegativity (Figure 8.2). Thus they neither
strive for further electrons nor they are interested in loosing one; accordingly they show
high charge-transfer energies, also high lying 5d states and lack efficient excitation and
relaxation pathways. This certainly limits the application of Er3+ in simple phosphors as
is pointed out in a thorough discussion on the consequences of Equation (7.19) in Chap￾ter 8.3. Remarkably though, the gaps between their excited 4f states are quite similar. In
combination with the former facts, this makes them highly interesting for up-conversion
as well as signal amplification phosphors. Both applications require long lifetimes of the
excited states given the low transition probabilities for the subsequent absorption of
more than one photon on the same Er3+ on one side. On the other, the long lifetime of
excited states enables excited states to get pumped for stimulated emission in laser ap￾plications.
This goal is achieved by the basic properties like large energetic distance of states
of opposite parity and charge-transfer states as outlined above. Moreover, doping Er3+
into host structures, which show very weak interactions, such as fluorides or oxides
enhances these low transition probabilities further.
Over long distances—imagine for instance a transatlantic telecommunication
cable—the intensity of the optical signals in glass fiber cables drops significantly. This
requires regular modules where the intensity of the signal is amplified. And here phos￾phors or glass fiber sections doped with trivalent erbium ions come into play. In such
a module, an infrared laser diode providing a 980 nm excitation wavelength pumps148 � 8 Optical Properties

Upconversion
The subsequent absorption of more than one photon and final emission of a single pho￾ton of higher energy than the absorbed ones is called an up-conversion or anti-Stokes
process—which just states that the emitted photon comprises a substantially higher en￾ergy than the exciting one. Nonsignificant processes in this context are the absorption
of thermal energy, which might lead to a slightly higher-energy emission. Up-conversion
may take place as subsequent absorption of photons of the ground and then of an excited
state on the same ion, i. e., excited state absorption occurs. Alternatively, the second exci￾tation occurs by assistance of a sensitizing ion, which transfers its excitation energy via
one of the mechanisms considered in Chapter 7.6 onto the emitting ion, i. e., energy trans￾fer up-conversion or other cooperative processes of low probability as outlined in [319].
Such up-conversion processes were discovered independently by Auzel71 and Feofilov72
in 1966. Since then, up-conversion has been described for several outer transition metal
ions like Cr3+, Mo3+ or Re4+, but especially for lanthanide ions; compared with other non￾linear processes up-conversion is about eight orders of magnitude more efficient than
second harmonic generation or a so-called two-photon absorption [319].

The activator or emitter itself should be present in low concentration to avoid clus￾tering and interactions between adjacent emitter ions as these lead to radiationless re￾laxation, such as cross-relaxation. The intensity of the up-converted emission scales via
Iup-conversion ∝ I
p
exc (8.15)
with the power of p subsequently absorbed photons of the exciting radiation intensity
Iexc, if the energy transfer probabilities are low; if they are high, p converges to one, es￾pecially when the concentration of the sensitizer is sufficiently large. By the way, in this
context such phosphors may also be named antenna phosphors as discussed in Chap￾ter 8.4.2.
A proven efficient material for up-conversion from the near infrared around 980 nm
to the visible regime—and efficient means a yield of 10 % photon conversion efficiency—
is β-Na[YF4
]:Er3+,Yb3+
.
73 The process basically also works with trivalent erbium ions
alone. But especially the higher excitations yielding also green emissions require a fur￾ther sensitizer ion, namely Yb3+. This is doped with a significant amount of around
20 %—which I would call rather a mixed crystal with yttrium than doping. Er3+ is present
on up to 3 % of all trivalent cation sites; if erbium sensitizes itself the concentration is
certainly higher within the range of 20 to 30 %. Because of the almost equidistant ex￾cited states, Er3+ is such a well-suited ion for up-conversion. It may be excited by photon
energies around 980 nm and around 1,500 nm and. This makes them interesting for the
enhancement of solar cell efficiencies as then infrared radiation below the band-gap of
the respective semiconductor may be up-converted and also being harvested [308, 320].
In the example shown in the right part of Figure 8.14, the sensitizer ions Yb3+ ab￾sorb radiation of approximately 980 nm and transfer it onto neighboring Er3+ ions. Due
to the long lifetime of the excited erbium state 4
I
11/2, it may absorb another photon
transferred from ytterbium via the transition 4
F7/2←4
I
11/2. From there, several radia￾tionless relaxations compete with two green emissions from the states 2H11/2 and 4
S3/2
as well as a red one from 4
F9/2. The intensity ratio of these visible transitions depends
from the doping concentrations of emitter and sensitizer and certainly also from the
host structure into which both were doped. Of course, further excitations are basically
possible but these are even more improbable and were not only for the sake of better
clarity omitted here. Further suited ions for such up-conversion processes based on yt￾terbium and erbium are Ho3+ and Tm3+. These enable blue emissions; in combination
with red and green emitters this opens the door for transparent displays based on up￾conversion phosphors. In trivalent thulium, the same sensitizing mechanism as in the
previously discussed example occurs from the 980 nm transition of Yb3+. Via the exci￾tations 3H5←3H6
followed by an intermediate radiationless relaxation, the second exci￾tation 3H4←3

follows. From here, a further direct excitation 1G4←3H4

emitting state causing the blue emission of 21.3⋅103
cm– 1 (ca. 470 nm) to the ground state
via the hypersensitive transition 1G4→3H6
(see Figure 8.17).
Another up-conversion system, capable of converting visible into u. v. light, is Pr3+
,
where the up-conversion process runs via a first excitation into the 3
PJ multiplet (see Fig￾ure 8.16 in Chapter 8.4.9) as intermediate state and further by absorbing another photon
to reach the high lying 5d states. From here, an allowed transition to the ground state
occurs as demonstrated on Y2
(SiO4
)O:Pr3+ [321]. For further up-conversion systems on
lanthanide ions, I would refer to [319] where up-conversion cascades are described also
for Nd3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ and Tm2+. Moreover, such up-conversion processes give rise for ap￾plication in lasers or in commercial product identification systems via specific emission
footprint patterns.
8.4.8 Neodymium—A Perfect Match for Stimulated Emission
Trivalent neodymium is the spectroscopic twin of trivalent erbium. Thus, Nd3+ belongs
to the same group of rare-earth ions like Er3+, which are in the pleasant situation to be
fairly happy with their electronic configuration; here [Xe]4f3
. They are neither looking
for a further electron—accordingly quite distant charge-transfer states—nor looking
for getting rid of an electron yielding quite distant 5d states around at least 5 to 6 eV.
The terms are the same as already seen for trivalent erbium ([Xe]4f11), but with op￾posite order of J levels leading to the 4
I
9/2 ground state. Therefore also, the transition
probabilities for induced electric dipole transitions are relatively small, and lumines￾cence is surely not on the top of neodymium’s interests. Figure 8.15 depicts the relevant
states for one of the most important applications of Nd3+, i. e., in solid state lasers. It also
displays all states in the visible regime important for the reflection spectrum shown
and its violet color impression. Moreover, the different intensities of spin-allowed and
spin-forbidden transitions may be pointed out here. To emphasize this, I left out some

transitions from the elusive manifold of transitions possible in the visible regime and
selected those with the relatively highest intensities according to the largest Judd–Ofelt
parameters U
λ
(Chapter 7.8). Also here, the hypersensitive transition 4G5/2←4
I
9/2 is very
intense. It was found that the shape and intensity of this transition as well as those of the
other hypersensitive transitions of Nd3+ and Pr3+ elucidate details about the interaction
of Nd3+ with complex ligands, especially biomolecules [322].
Solid State Lasers
In a phosphor like the aforementioned Eu2
[B2
(SO4
)
6
] individual Eu3+ ions may be excited
via 4f–4f or charge-transfer transitions (see Chapter 8.4.3). After an arbitrary time, they
relax back to the ground state by spontaneous emission of a photon. Since 4f–4f transi￾tions are parity forbidden, the lifetime of the excited states is fairly long. If the excitation
transition is an at least partially allowed one, and the finally achieved excited state only
shows forbidden transitions to the ground state, there might occur a situation in which
several ions are simultaneously excited. If, under these circumstances, an emitted pho￾ton interacts with another excited ion, stimulated emission of a further photon of same
energy, same polarization and same phase occurs, i. e., light amplification by stimulated
emission of radiation.
The first laser, invented in 1960, was a so-called three-level laser, where the final ex￾cited state 2
E of Cr3+ was reached via the spin-allowed ground state excitation 4
T2g←4A2g
and a subsequent relaxation to the 2
E term. The emission back to the ground state 4A2g
from here is spin-forbidden. Hence, by optical pumping a population inversion on the
2
Eg
term is achieved. The emission to the ground state 2
Eg→4A2g can then be stimulated
by the emission of adjacent chromium ions. The disadvantage of this setup is that it is
necessary for efficient laser operation to excite more than half of all chromium atoms
at the same time; otherwise, no population inversion with respect to the ground state
is achieved. Further, the laser emission occurs only pulsed, as the emitted pulse effaces
the population inversion.
A better setup is a so-called four-level laser in which the target state of the stimu￾lated emission—the fourth state in the game—is slightly above the actual ground state.
This fourth state should be sufficiently high not to be populated thermally and makes
sure that already at low excitation rates a population inversion is achieved. Hence, such
a laser may be operated in a continuous mode.
And here neodymium enters the stage. Considering Figure 8.15, neodymium can
be excited from its ground state, 4
I
9/2, via a relatively efficient hypersensitive transi￾tion to the 4
F5/2 term and many higher ones. Further, a quite stable excited state 4
F3/2
with a lifetime around 200 µs, and finally the desired fourth state 4
I
11/2 approximately
2100 cm– 1 above the ground state exists—sufficiently prevented from thermal occupa￾tion (see Equation (7.14)). Therefore, we see here a four-level system fulfilling the afore￾mentioned preconditions for such a four-level laser—optical pumping and easy popula￾tion inversion on 4
F3/2 with respect to the 4
I
11/2 term. The optical pumping is also possible152 � 8 Optical Properties
via an interconfigurational and, therefore, allowed transition in the 5d states localized
at around five to six electron volts.
As the host structure, many oxidic materials are feasible providing suited sites
for doping with typically 1 % trivalent neodymium ions like yttrium aluminium garnet
(YAG, Y3Al2
(AlO4
)
3
), CaWO4
or glasses. Accordingly, the Nd3+ solid state laser may be
optically pumped via charge-transfer transitions of sensitizers or direct excitation of
neodymium’s 5d—yielding a poor energy efficiency. But nowadays either lamps emit￾ting white light, which can be absorbed by the manifold of lines in the visible regime,
or laser diodes, which directly address the hypersensitive transition 4
F5/2←4
I
9/2 are
employed. The emitted wavelength usually peaks around 1,064 nm (9,400 cm– 1). Green
laser pointers are frequently based on YAG:Nd3+ lasers including a frequency doubling
crystal yielding the green emission at 532 nm—certainly this gives also rise for further
frequency-doubled lasers with an emission of ca. 265 nm for various applications.
YAG:Er3+ lasers are suited for medical applications as the emission wavelength of
2.80 µm (3,570 cm– 1) based on the 4
I
11/2→4
I
13/2 transition (Figure 8.14) is strongly ab￾sorbed by matter containing water. Thus, thermal damage of adjacent tissue when re￾moving, e. g., cancerous tissue can be reduced. Within the targeted tissue, the water
evaporates vigorously, and thus the tissue is locally destroyed. Such lasers are employed
in medicine also for eye surgeries or dental and skin treatments.
Table 8.3 lists selected reported lanthanide lasers with their respective transitions.
Apparently, some ions allow for several laser transitions; their suitability depends from
the host structure and filters employed fostering specific transitions. The wavelengths

8.4.9 Praseodymium—Occasionally a Knife for Photons
The electronic configuration of trivalent praseodymium ions of [Xe]4f2
(ground state:
3H4
) is significantly less stable as that of the previously discussed ions Nd3+, Er3+ and
Ho3+ (Figure 8.3). Already, the averaged composition of the oxide, Pr6O11 = Pr2O3
⋅ 4 PrO2
with a brown body color, suggests a significant stability of the tetravalent state; thus,
5d states are localized at comparably low energies, here around 200 nm. So, Pr3+ may
efficiently be excited via the parity allowed absorption into the 5d states by VUV radia￾tion.74 Radiationless relaxation occurs to the excited and relatively long-lived 1
S0
state if
it is sufficiently separated from the 5d states. This is the case in weak coordination sur￾roundings with a weak nephelauxetic effect; such a situation is basically attractive for
the application as a so-called quantum cutter or down-conversion phosphor—discussed
in the second part of this chapter.
Normally, the 1
S0
state will lie within the 5d states, and thus the fast radiationless
relaxation propagates down to the emitting state 3
P0
. From here, the usual luminescence
of Pr3+ yields visible red emissions mainly into the 3
F2
and 3H6
levels and further in
the orange, yellow and green regimes. Such clean emissions might be suited for xenon
plasma driven lamps or displays. There the excitating plasma wavelengths of 148 and
172 nm fit nicely to the efficient 5d←3H4
transition. Let us now consider a single pixel of
such a display. For the sake of a better contrast, it would be advantageous if the phosphor
particles of the respective color point would not be white but colored—for instance, in
the same color, which is emitted. For Pr3+ doped host structures this might be feasible
if traces of tetravalent praseodymium ions were also present. These usually colorize
compounds dark violet or red likewise the mentioned oxide Pr6O11 because of ligand-to￾metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transitions according to

Whether or not this was an accidental discovery, but finally the researchers of a com￾pany developed the red phosphor Zr(SiO4
):Pr3+,Pr4+,P5+. Essentially, zircon was doped
with trivalent praseodymium. Due to the quite high doping concentration of up to 15 %,
after absorption in the VUV efficient relaxation to the 3
P0
level occurs, from where a
dominating red emission can be recorded via the spin-allowed transition 3
P0→3H6
. Dur￾ing the synthesis starting from SiO2
, ZrO2
and Pr6O11, Zr(SiO4
) is simultaneously doped
with Pr3+ and Pr4+ yielding a dark red powder. During the following treatment with the
74 VUV = vacuum UV light: 100–200 nm.154 � 8 Optical Properties
mild reducing agent, carbon monoxide, most of the tetravalent praseodymium ions were
reduced, but some survived on the zirconium sites. These feature a significantly smaller
ionic radius compared with that of Pr3+ and Pr4+ ions; it was occasionally observed that
the site size within the host structure influences the stability of the better fitting ion. Rel￾evant ionic radii of Zr4+ and the rare-earth ions with different coordination numbers
are listed in Appendix A. Here, the small sites suited for Zr4+ stabilize Pr4+ regarding
size and charge. This stabilization occurs at the cost of the desired emitter, here triva￾lent praseodymium. Moreover, every introduced Pr3+ in exchange for a Zr4+ generates a
defect in the anion lattice; therefore, the authors undertook a further doping with PO3 –
4
for SiO4 –
4
by adding sodium phosphate during the synthesis to minimize the number of
defects [325].
Quantum Cutting
As soon as the 1
S0
term is sufficiently decoupled from the 5d states, quantum cutting,
a down-conversion process, is basically possible. To achieve this situation, a very weak
coordination around Pr3+ is required. This is most easily the case in fluorides, such as
Sr(AlF5
):Pr3+(0.3 %) where the rare-earth ion substitutes for strontium [324]. In the crys￾tal structure, the strontium sites are coordinated in a ninefold irregular fashion by heli￾cal chains of AlF6
octahedra [326]. Accordingly, the effective coordination charge of the
fluoride ions amounts to only 0.5. Hence, the 5d states of Pr3+, which interact strongly
with ligands, experience a very weak nephelauxetic effect and also weak electrostatic in￾teractions. After excitation into the 5d states, the 1
S0
term is thermically populated from
where at least two subsequent emissions according to Figure 8.16 occur, a so-called cas￾cade emission. This effect was discovered 50 years ago by Sommerdijk75 and Piper76 for
YF3
:Pr3+ [327, 328].
In such cases, one absorbed photon causes emission of approximately two photons.
These phosphors are interesting for energy efficient lighting based on xenon plasma
excitation, which emits radiation in the VUV at 148 and 172 nm. Compact fluorescent
lamps are usually based on a mercury plasma; since mercury is highly toxic, a substitute
such as xenon is desired. Unfortunately, the excitation occurs at clearly higher energy,
which then requires a higher energy efficency of the phosphors—and here quantum
cutting urges onto the wish list. Further examples for quantum cutting are Cs2KYF6
:Pr3+
or, based on other rare-earth ions, Gd2O(SiO4
):Eu3+ and Ba9
Lu2
Si6O24:Tb3+ [329–331]. For
even more examples and for further reading, I recommend [332]. In the chapter on triva￾lent ytterbium, we will see another quantum cutting effect including energy transfer and
of actual interest.

8.4.10 Thulium—Normally Blue
With its electronic configuration of [Xe]4f12 (ground state: 3H6
) the trivalent ion of
thulium is the spectroscopic twin of Pr3+. While these had a certain tendency to get oxi￾dized to the tetravalent states, Tm3+ has a certain tendency to get reduced to the divalent
state. It is like Pr3+ and less stable compared with its neighbors Er3+ and Ho3+. This is also
obvious from the chemical shift model (Figure 8.3) and the Frost diagram (Figure 3.8).
Tm3+ apparently strives toward a fully occupied 4f shell while praseodymium did the
same toward an empty one—both eventually are thus aspiring toward a closed-shell
scenario. Also here, as already discussed for the previous twins, the terms span a sig￾nificantly broader energy regime. For instance, the gap between the terms 3H4
and 3H6
amounts to roughly 4,500 cm– 1 in Pr3+ and to more than 12,700 cm– 1 in Tm3+. Still, the
states of opposite parity, the 5d and charge-transfer states, are localized at high energies.
Therefore, the transition intensities are relatively low. The most prominent emission of
Tm3+ is the dominating blue one due to the 1D2→3

transition around 450 nm as shown
in Figure 8.17.
Trivalent thulium is mainly used for rare-earth based lasers [333]. Our chosen exam￾ple here is the YAG:Tm3+ laser, mainly employed for medical applications. There, a two￾for-one cross-relaxation mechanism occurs by which initially the transition 3H4←3H6
is
pumped by a diode laser with an energy of 12,800 cm– 1 (780 nm, orange arrow in Fig￾ure 8.17, right). If Y3Al2

occurs from here to the higher J sublevels of the ground term 3H6 with a wavelength
of 1.8 µm. This term 3H6
shows a significant sublevel splitting, so effectively a four-level
laser system is realized here. Since the vitreous body of the human eye fully absorbs the
emitted wavelength, this laser system can be employed quite safely in medical applica￾tions.
Because of similar reasons alike Er3+ also Tm3+ shows efficient up-conversion illus￾trated in the term scheme in Figure 8.17 (right). In an up-conversion laser system like

two photons of different energy by up-conversion. Also here, the eightfold coordination
of the yttrium sites is very weak. Y(LiF4
) crystallizes in the scheelite type, which derives
from fluorite by a distortion yielding a tetrahedral surrounding of lithium. Thus, the
effective coordination charge of fluorine amounts to 0.75 here.
8.4.11 Ytterbium—Solar Cells are Pleased
The ground state of trivalent ytterbium is 2
F7/2 in accordance with an almost fully oc￾cupied [Xe]4f13 shell. Therefore, ytterbium alike europium shows a tendency to get re￾duced to the divalent state. Trivalent ytterbium is also the spectroscopic twin of Ce3+
,
which will be discussed in the next chapters. Again, the splitting between the terms and
states is larger for Yb3+, and thus here the 5d states do not play that crucial role than8.4 Emitters Weakly Interacting With Ligands � 157

in Ce3+ as we will see there. Hence, we have to consider only two 4f terms here, the
ground term and the excited term 2
F5/2, separated by approximately 10,000 cm– 1 in the
infrared regime—yielding colorless Yb3+ ions (Figure 8.18). Besides a role as a sensitizer
ion for up-conversion processes as mentioned in Chapter 8.4.7 trivalent ytterbium ions
may also act as an emitter in down-conversion processes.
Considering the term scheme, only 4f–4f emissions in the infrared regime are ex￾pected from trivalent ytterbium ions. This emission can be well absorbed by semicon￾ductors typically employed in solar cells. For instance, silicon exhibits a band gap around
9,000 cm– 1 or 1,100 nm. Looking at the solar emission spectrum (Figure 8.18), it is obvi￾ous that the sun emits strongly in the blue, but even a blue photon only excites a single
electron in such a semiconductor. Therefore, the idea arose to cut blue photons into two
infrared ones, and thus enhance the light to electricity conversion efficiency of solar cells
[334]. In a quantum cutter phosphor like SrF2
:Pr3+(0.1 %),Yb3+(5 %), the praseodymium
ions absorb blue light and then a two-step cross-relaxation illustrated by the broken
dark blue arrows in Figure 8.18 occurs, where two neighboring Yb3+ ions are excited.
These then emit infrared light, which can be absorbed by the solar cell. This phosphor
shows an efficiency of 140 %, so apparently in average 1.4 photons are generated from
one absorbed blue photon. Both praseodymium and ytterbium are doped on the stron￾tium sites in SrF2
, which crystallizes in the fluorite type. The charge mismatch between
R
3+ and Sr2+ generates cation defects in the material. It is well known that in such defect
structures the doped ions form local clusters to minimize the overall loss of lattice en￾ergy by defect formation [335, 336]. Such clusters, though, make sure that the sensitizing
praseodymium ions are in a close neighborhood of the ytterbium emitters onto which
the energy has to be transferred. What a nice coincidence!158 � 8 Optical Properties
8.5 Emitters Strongly Interacting With Ligands (5d–4f Transitions)
While the 4f states are well shielded by the full 5s2
p
6
shell, the 5d states are fully exposed
to the impact of the ligands. Applying the chemical shift model (Chapter 8.3), from the
diagram shown in Figure 8.3 typical positions of 5d states with respect to the 4f ground
states can be deduced. For most of the trivalent rare-earth ions, the 5d states are found
at very high energies, except for Ce3+. In the case of sufficiently stable divalent ions, Eu2+
is the most interesting one with 5d states in reach. In this section, we will focus first on
Ce3+, discuss relevant factors and parameters influencing the optical properties, which
essentially also apply to divalent europium discussed thereafter.
Figure 8.19: Schematic energy level scheme of YAG:Ce3+ illustrating
the consequences of nephelauxetic effect (n. e.) and ligand-field￾splitting (l. f. s.).
As depicted in Figure 8.19 in trivalent cerium ions, the 5d states in the naked ion are
situated around 51,500 cm– 1 above the ground state level. Already, the covalent interac￾tion with the ligands’ electron clouds, the nephelauxetic effect, results in a stabilization of
roughly 15,000 cm– 1. The electrostatic interactions yield an enormous ligand-field split￾ting of all five 5d orbitals spanning approximately 30,000 cm– 1 [251]. So, the centroid
shift of the 5d states’ barycenter is caused by the nephelauxetic effect already discussed
in Chapter 8.1 and combined with the ligand-field splitting the lowest lying 5d states
enter the visible regime. Therefore, YAG:Ce3+, i. e., Y3Al2
(AlO4
)
3
:Ce3+ doped with triva￾lent cerium on the yttrium sites, can be excited already by blue light and subsequently
emits yellow light. Most importantly, 5d→4f transitions are allowed according to the
parity selection rule regardless of the local surrounding. Thus, the excited states may
be relatively short-lived; moreover, such transitions may be very intense with quantum
efficiencies up to 100 %.
Because of the strong nephelauxetic effect on the 5d states, and almost none on the
4f ones, the relative shift of the potential curves of 4f and 5d states is considerable. This
situation was already depicted in Figure 8.1. Accordingly, many transitions from many8.5 Emitters Strongly Interacting With Ligands (5d–4f Transitions) � 159
different vibrational levels may occur, which leads to broad bands for both, the excita￾tion and emission transitions with fairly large Stokes shifts.
The chemical shift model also suggests to distinguish between transitions into the
low-spin and high-spin states of the 5d configurations as transitions there may be spin￾forbidden [252]. At least for the here discussed ions Ce3+ and Eu2+, this is not relevant. If
considering divalent thulium or other ions of the second-half of the lanthanide series,
this is another story addressed in Chapter 8.7.
8.5.1 Trivalent Cerium—the Most Efficient Ln3+
Because of its electronic ground state configuration [Xe]4f1
, trivalent cerium is essen￾tially the spectroscopic twin of Yb3+. However, Ce3+ ions are clearly larger, and hence
the spacing between the two 4f terms declines from 10,000 observed for Yb3+ to just
above 2,100 cm– 1 here. Moreover, the spacing between ground state and 5d states is with
roughly 100,000 cm– 1 out of reach for practical relevance in case of trivalent ytterbium.
According to the chemical shift model, the 4f states of Ce3+ are situated at relatively high
energies compared to the other trivalent rare-earth elements as shown in Figure 8.3.
This very nicely reflects the fair stability of the tetravalent oxidation state. Looking at
trivalent ions, the 5d–4f spacing is the smallest here and roughly around 51,500 cm– 1
.
Nephelauxetic effect and ligand-field splitting then yield spacings between 4f and
5d states in the visible and u. v. regimes. YAG:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce) was already discussed be￾fore. Figure 8.20 shows two further compounds, an yttrium compound doped with

approach the doped cerium ions closer in YBS:Ce than in CeBS. Hence, the electrostatic

interactions are stronger in YBS:Ce compared with CeBS. The same holds for the co￾valent interactions, thus the nephelauxetic effect is stronger in YBS:Ce. This situation
is depicted in the schematic energy level diagrams shown. Consequently, the 5d󴀗󴀰4f
transitions should occur at lower energies and longer wavelengths for YBS:Ce. This is
indeed the case considering the spectra in Figure 8.20. Moreover, we see two emission
transitions toward the two 4f terms 2
F7/2 and 2
F5/2.
Comparing further YBS:Ce and YAG:Ce, the size of the yttrium site is comparable.
But considering the next coordination spheres in YAG and YBS, in the former Si4+ and
Al3+ are bound to the coordinating O2 – anions while in the latter S6+ are bound to oxide.
Thus, the effective coordination charge is clearly lower in the latter case and the ligand￾field splitting as well as the nephelauxetic effect are significantly smaller in YBS. Hence,
the transitions in YBS:Ce occur solely in the UV, those in YAG:Ce already in the visible
regime.

The most prominent cerium phosphor is indeed YAG:Ce. As depicted in Figure 8.21,
it can be excited efficiently in the blue regime and converts approximately 90 % of all
absorbed photons into a broad and unresolved single yellow emission band, i. e., a quan￾tum efficiency of roughly 90 %. Its main applications are in white light emitting diodes,
discussed in Chapter 8.6, or compact fluorescent lamps (Chapter 8.4.3). A typical synthe￾sis runs via a coprecipitation where solutions of the respective nitrates form according

application. The powder itself is bright yellow.8.5 Emitters Strongly Interacting With Ligands (5d–4f Transitions) � 161
Extending our consideration, this means that the transition energies of trivalent
cerium may be tuned over a quite large regime by an appropriate chemical variation
of the coordination environment. Ce3+ emissions are observed from the deep ultravio￾let through the orange-red regime, excitations from the deep ultraviolet until the blue
regime. Accordingly, also the Stokes shifts are extraordinarily large. But certainly with
increasing Stokes shift also the thermal quenching temperature decreases. Prominent
applications dealing with large Stokes shifts are white light emitting diodes, where
YAG:Ce is used, or as scintillation phosphor.
Scintillation and Storage Phosphors
Scintillation phosphors convert ionizing radiation immediately into ultraviolet or visi￾ble radiation. They are employed in detectors and wherever a quick and easily visible
detection of such radiation is required. Storage phosphors also detect ionizing radiation
but store and collect the absorbed energy until a respective physical impulse like a laser
or heat leads to emission of the converted radiation. The ionizing radiation, such as X-,
α-, β- and γ-rays excites the activators in these phosphors either directly via 5d←4f tran￾sitions or via ionization of the host structure. In the latter case, the generated very fast
electrons are slowed down by ionizing further electrons, and finally the formation of a
multitude of excitons. An exciton is an excited electron loosely bound to the respective
hole forming a quasiparticle carrying an integral spin. In the case of scintillation, these
generate excited Ce3+ ions, which then cause luminescence. Hence, the number of ex￾cited cerium ions is then proportional to the incoming intensity, the same holds for the
emitted luminescence [337–339]. An example for a storage phosphor will be described
in the second part of this chapter.
The basic requirements for such phosphors are a short relaxation time, an emission
fitting for the respective application and a high radiation stability. To detect γ-rays ef￾ficiently, a high density and a high atomic number are also necessary [339]. The short
relaxation time is required for a good time resolved detection. If the phosphor shall be
employed for the visible detection of ionizing radiation during, for instance, alignment
works, it should emit in the green regime as the human eye is most sensitive here. Re￾garding the excitation the phosphor has to provide suited excitation transitions in the
regime of the radiation to be detected. And finally, a good chemical stability against the
radiation is necessary to allow for a long-term application and for reproducible detec￾tion results. In a few examples listed in Table 8.4, these principles will be discussed.
Trivalent cerium ions are among the best candidates for scintillation as the 5d󴀗󴀰4f
transitions are allowed during excitation and emission for parity and spin. This ensures
high absorption and a quantitative response scaling with the incoming radiation energy.
Moreover, the transitions are fast and the luminescence properties are fairly straightfor￾ward to record as no further 4f–4f emissions are possible, and thus have not to be con￾sidered. The situation is more complicated employing other rare-earth ions like Pr3+ and
Eu2+ where also 5d–4f transitions are relevant, as here further 4f–4f transitions might162 � 8 Optical Properties

play a role. Further, in Ce3+ only one emission type has to be recorded in contrast to pure
salts like CsI where two emissions with differing lifetimes compete.
The chemical stability of the host structure is enhanced with increasing bond en￾ergy, which is achieved by stable covalent bonds or high lattice energies. Accordingly,
simple halides are generally less stable compared with oxides; silicates are often more
stable than simple salts. This can be seen watching the values of the radiation stabil￾ity in Table 8.4 where both silicates Gd2O(SiO4
):Ce3+ and Lu2O(SiO4
):Ce3+ show a clearly
higher stability than the halides. Both compounds have the same structure as discussed
in Chapter 6.5. Lu3+ are smaller than Gd3+ ions, thus the coordinating oxygen atoms are
situated closer to the doped Ce3+ ions. Hence, ligand-field splitting and nephelauxetic
effect increase from the gadolinium to the lutetium compound resulting in a shorter ex￾citation and emission wavelength of the latter. Because of the slightly smaller size of the
rare-earth site, the lutetium compound is slightly more sensitive against oxidation of the
larger Ce3+ to Ce4+, which would fit better on this site; therefore, the radiation stability of
this compound is slightly lower than that of the gadolinium compound. A further advan￾tage of the gadolinium compound is the presence of 4f states up to very high energies
providing further excitation pathways. Moreover, the response and relaxation times of
the cerium doped compounds are significantly shorter than those of classical scintilla￾tors like Tl+ where allowed p–s transitions are at work. There, both states are broad
yielding broad excitation and emission bands but both show stronger interaction, and
thus longer lifetimes.
As mentioned before, several applications employ scintillation phosphors. In
medicine and materials science, XCT (X-ray computed tomography) allows for fairly fast
obtained three-dimensional images of matter with—at least for medical application—
comparably low X-ray intensities. Another three-dimensional tomography is PET
(positron emission tomography), where radioactive nuclei like 11

γ-photons propagating in exactly opposite direction.
A further material, basically also capable of acting as scintillation phosphor, is
BaFBr:Eu2+ [340]; it is isostructural with PbFCl. BaFBr:Eu2+ is much better known for8.5 Emitters Strongly Interacting With Ligands (5d–4f Transitions) � 163

its famous properties as a storage phosphor. The basic energy level scheme is depicted
in Figure 8.22 and shows the storage mechanism. Like every inorganic compound also
BaFBr contains many defects; because of the lower lattice energy contribution, mostly
bromide defects are present here [318]. Upon irradiation with ionizing radiation, the
Eu2+ ions doped into BaFBr are oxidized to the more stable trivalent state. These elec￾trons migrate via the conduction band to nearby electron traps, i. e., especially bromide
vacancies. Here, the excited electrons are stored. These traps are too deep for the elec￾trons to be released by thermal energy. So, after excitation the irradiating energies are
stored likewise a hidden image. To read out this information, a red laser excites the
trapped electrons again back into the conduction band from where they are collected
by adjacent Eu3+ ions. These are basically too small for the barium sites and strive for
reduction back to Eu2+, which fits much better. Hence, these electrons reduce the Eu3+
and yield an excited Eu2+ ion, which then immediately emits its excitation energy. Be￾cause of the presence of europium, indeed a defined single emission is caused. In case
of BaFBr:Eu2
, this energy is emitted as blue light. Since blue light is higher in energy
than the red laser light used for read-out, it can be excluded that other sources than the
hidden image contribute to the emitted radiation. Eventually, all traps are emptied by
white light to erase any stored information prior to a new detection cycle.
The phosphor under consideration here, BaFBr:Eu2+, is employed in so-called imag￾ing plates for the detection of X-rays. There, the irradiated matter causes a hidden image.
This image can be the diffraction pattern of a crystalline sample or the transmission
image of a human body. Accordingly, it is necessary here to store the image until it is
read-out. The same mechanism occurs in persistent phosphors, treated in Chapter 8.4.5,
and in natural rocks where excited electrons are trapped in defects. There a read-out
may give information about the age of ancient fire places because the strong heat then
released any trapped electron thermally in contrast to the adjacent rocks not heated suf￾ficiently. The excitation here is caused by natural ionizing radiation. It should certainly
be noted that usually no suited doping with rare-earth ions is present so the lumines￾cence behavior is complicated [311, 341].164 � 8 Optical Properties
8.5.2 Divalent Europium—a True Chameleon
While in Ce3+ only a single 4f electron screened the 5d states in its ground state and
none in its excited state, in divalent europium with its ground state configuration
[Xe]4f7
(
8
S7/2), there are seven and in its first excited state [Xe]4f6
5d1
still six shielding
4f electrons. Hence, the 5d states in the latter are better shielded, and thus more dif￾fuse than those in trivalent cerium. Further, the ionic radius of divalent europium is
larger than that of trivalent cerium. The ionic radii of different coordination numbers
are listed in Appendix A. Consequently, all these factors lead to a stronger interaction
with coordinating atoms and, therefore, the Stokes shift is in comparable surroundings
normally even larger, the thermal quenching temperature lower in Eu2+ compared with
Ce3+
.
Comparing Eu2+ with the isoelectronic Gd3+ ions, the effective nuclear charge is
lower in europium. Therefore, the splitting between the 4f states is lower here. In Eu2+
,
the transition 6
P7/2󴀗󴀰8
S7/2 occurs around 27,800 cm– 1, in Gd3+ around 32,200 cm– 1. How￾ever, this transition is rarely visible in emission spectra as the 5d–4f transitions are al￾lowed, and thus orders of magnitude faster and more intense.
Due to the half-filled 4f shell, divalent europium ions are the most stable divalent
rare-earth ions, and so is the 4f ground term considering the chemical shift model dis￾cussed in Chapter 8.3. Like for trivalent cerium, also in divalent europium the energies
of the 5d states can be tuned via the nephelauxetic effect causing a centroid shift of the
5d barycenter and the ligand-field splitting, which we discussed in detail in the begin￾ning of this chapter. Because of the lower charge, the gap between 4f ground state and
the 5d states is clearly smaller in Eu2+, roughly 39,800 cm– 1 for the spin-allowed transi￾tion to the 8
P term; for Ce3+ we remember the value of 51,500 cm– 1. How to derive the
term symbols of the excited 5d states of divalent europium was explained in Chapter 7.2;
the J levels can be omitted as the 5d states show a very large width. The energetically
higher lying 8
P term dominates for the excitation over the lowest lying 8H term around
33,900 cm– 1 because of the transition selection rule
ΔL = ±1 (8.21)
Nevertheless, the emission occurs—with slightly longer relaxation time—from the low￾est lying term. The larger Stokes shifts allow for tuning the emission color of Eu2+ from
the ultraviolet through the whole visible spectrum until deep red emissions. Figure 8.23
depicts schematically the energy levels of selected phosphors and their emission spec￾tra; Table 8.5 lists selected data of these phosphors. As for Ce3+ and also for Eu2+, very
high quantum efficiencies close to 100 % are reported. In this section, we will take a re￾spective journey based on the phosphors displayed here.
Our journey starts with a phosphor Ba[B4O6

weak coordination as derived in Chapter 6.5 on silicate-analogous compounds. This ex￾ample was chosen because here the coordination environment is so weak that even at
room temperature both emissions, the 5d→4f as well as the 4f→4f transition, are mon￾itored. The latter is expected to be a sharp, the former a comparably broad emission
band. And indeed in Figure 8.23 (right) the violet emission band peaking around 360 nm
shows the overlap of a broad and a sharp band. This weak coordination is mainly caused
by the long coordination distances as Ba2+ is clearly larger than Eu2+ on one hand and
the low effective coordination charges of the ligand oxygen and fluorine atoms. In such
situations, it is likely that the europium atoms do not center the coordination polyhe￾dron but are attached more or less to one side leaving the backside almost noncoordi￾nated. Emissions in this regime are usually of interest for water disinfection or as invis￾ible product safety markers since the whole emission band is located in the ultraviolet
regime and the emission is excited with u. v. radiation around 290 nm [235].166 � 8 Optical Properties
In the second example, α-Sr[PO3

:Eu2+, the europium ions find themselves on stron￾tium sites perfectly fitting for Eu2+ since both essentially have the same ionic radii. The
coordination here is thus clearly stronger and further enhanced by a surrounding of ox￾ide only. Hence, the emission occurs on the edge between ultraviolet and blue light with
a maximum at 404 nm (Figure 8.23). The excitation is achieved best at 323 nm. In the sec￾ond coordination sphere phosphorus atoms with oxidation state +V catch significantly
electron density from the coordinating oxygen atoms thus weakening their coordina￾tion strength. To move further into the blue regime, this can be enhanced by formally
replacing pentavalent phosphorus by trivalent aluminium atoms. As we will see later,
this alone would shift the emission already into the green regime like in Sr[Al2O4
]:Eu2+
.
Therefore, to stay in the blue, the strontium atoms are formally replaced by the larger
barium ones yielding the famous phosphor BAM:Eu2+. BAM stands for Ba[MgAl10O17].
The host structure was described in Chapter 6.5.3. This blue phosphor is a prominent
blue emitter used in compact fluorescent lamps and emits around 450 nm when excited
in the ultraviolet regime. Another interesting phosphor is Ba[Si7N10]:Eu2+, which emits
already turquoise (Figure 8.23), on the brink toward green. It is the first nitridosilicate
during this journey. Compared with BAM, also here the Eu2+ ions are doped on barium
sites but instead of an aluminate surrounding the coordination is in summary slightly
strengthened by an increasing charge in the second coordination sphere going from Al3+
to Si4+ and in the first coordination sphere going from O2 – to N3 – . Thus, the nephelaux￾etic effect as well as the ligand-field splitting represented by the effective coordination
charge increase slightly, the emission wavelength is accordingly red-shifted to 484 nm. A
comparable emission is achieved in Sr6
[B(PO4
)

][PO4
]:Eu2+—you might guess yourself
how to explain this similarity. But due to the directly coordinating more electronegative
oxygen atoms here the Stokes shift is significantly smaller.
Moving on to the green to red regime, a stronger coordination is required.
Sr[Al2O4
]:Eu2+ emits greenish light around 520 nm as implied before. This phosphor
emits in the regime where the human eye recognizes light best, so it is employed in
safety applications. A thorough discussion on such long lasting or persistent phosphors
is given in Chapter 8.4.5. In green emitting Sr[Si2O2N2
]:Eu2+, again the europium ions
are doped on strontium sites, but due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the coordi￾nation sphere the nephelauxetic effect and the effective coordination are stronger here.
Switching to a pure nitrogen surrounding strongly fosters the coordination strength like
in red emitting Sr2
[Si5N8
]:Eu2+. And again, to shift the emission to the orange regime,
the respective barium compound is chosen. Ba2
[Si5N8
]:Eu2+ shows an emission peaking
at 600 nm from yellow through red and looking bright orange. Such phosphors like
the latter two are employed in white light emitting diodes since they show excellent
absorption in the blue regime and contribute the missing colors for white light [343].
Further red-shifted phosphors are only reasonable if the emission bands are narrow
enough to avoid significant emission in the infrared, the regime unaccessible to the hu￾man eye perception. Here, an indeed very interesting and important finding were the8.6 On White LEDs—a Short Story � 167
new nitride phosphors M[LiAl3N4
]:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr). Therein, not only the nephelaux￾etic effect of the coordinating nitride ions is stronger than in Sr2
[Si5N8
], due to a higher
coordination charge, as expected from our discussion so far. Remarkable is the almost
cubic coordination of the alkaline-earth sites on which the divalent europium ions are
doped. This apparently results in a fairly narrow potential curve and a narrow emis￾sion band peaking in the deep red region around 650 and 670 nm for the strontium and
calcium compounds. It is believed that this cubic environment hinders the vibrational
relaxation of the doped europium ions in ground and excited state, and thus further
fosters the narrow potential curve assumed here [228, 347].
Regarding lighting applications we are at the end of our journey here as a further
red shift of the emission yields an increasing contribution of infrared light [348]. Then
the energy efficiency of lamps drops as invisible light is produced. So, the red emissions
of CaO:Eu2+ and CaH2
:Eu2+ are hardly visible with the naked eye as they lie predomi￾nantly in the infrared regime with 733 and 764 nm, respectively. The trick, to shift the
emissions even further into the red regime, is to force the relatively large divalent eu￾ropium ions on the clearly smaller sites of Ca2+. Hence, the ligands approach the Eu2+
ions closer leading to a stronger coordination. The higher ligand-field splitting of the
higher charged oxygen atoms in calcium oxide with rock salt structure is apparently
outperformed by the stronger nephelauxetic effect of hydride in CaH2 with cottunite
structure of PbCl2
, nicely reflected in the larger Stokes shift here. But, as mentioned be￾fore, the stability of the divalent oxidation state is further reduced by doping on small
sites as then the formation of Eu3+ is favored even stronger. Hence, such phosphors show
a lower stability against oxidation. In case of the hydride, the reducing surrounding pre￾vents an easy oxidation here.
8.6 On White LEDs—a Short Story
Global warming is a topic of our days and it fostered the necessity of saving natural
resources. So, preventing our earth from overheating is also about saving energy wher￾ever possible. In 2013, the United Nations reported that 20 % of the worldwide electricity
consumption and 6 % of the global CO2
emissions were caused by lighting. Lighting pre￾dominantly was achieved by incandescent lamps developed in the 19th century. And
with an estimated further increase of 60 % energy consumption for lighting by the year
2030—if not addressed properly—the United Nations demanded to phase-out conven￾tional incandescent lamps to substitute them by either compact fluorescent lamps or
white LEDs [349]. In this section, I will give a rough overview on the concept of white light
emitting diodes and some historic aspects regarding blue light emitting diodes (LEDs).
The concept of incandescent lamps is simple. An electrical current flows through
a tungsten wire. The resistivity of tungsten then generates heat, and the tungsten wire
becomes so hot that it glows and produces light based on the principle of a black body ra￾diator. Most of the radiation is invisible infrared radiation, though, circa 98 %. Tungsten168 � 8 Optical Properties
is chosen for this application because of its high melting point of approximately 3,400 °C
allowing for the generation of white light. By the way, this light is usually recognized nat￾ural as it resembles the light of the big black body radiator named the sun. By far, more
efficient are compact fluorescent lamps, already addressed in Chapter 8.4.3. Therein, a
mercury plasma by electricity is generated, which then excites phosphors. And we saw
there, most of them contain rare-earth elements. White light emitting diodes can save
up to 80 % of energy used for conventional incandescent lamps. Thus, these will play a
decisive role in the more efficient consumption of electricity for lighting applications.
The story on white light emitting diodes began already in the 1960s when blue diodes
based on silicon carbide with a perfectly blue emission peaking around 465 nm corre￾sponding to a band gap of 2.7 eV were developed. Unfortunately, this band gap is an
indirect one yielding only poor emission efficiencies. A similar material, featuring the
same valence electron concentration, is gallium nitride. Both SiC and GaN crystallize in
the wurtzite structure type (see Appendix D). The band gap of 3.4 eV of gallium nitride is
a direct one and lies just below the brink between u. v. and blue light. Theoretically, GaN
would have been a perfect match for the concept of a white light emitting diode based on
a blue semiconducting emitter and a phosphor converting this blue emission partially
into yellowish light. According to the color diagram shown in Figure 8.25, the combina￾tion of blue and yellow then yields white light. But for several practical reasons there
were considerable problems leading to low efficiencies here. It took approximately 30
years to solve these problems and to develop an efficient blue LED based on gallium
nitride, which was rewarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2014. This latter fact
demonstrates how challenging the problems, and how elegant their solution was. Cer￾tainly, also other materials like zinc selenide were on the agenda but finally gallium ni￾tride made the race. The prize was awarded to Akasaki,
77 Amano78 and Nakamura79 lit￾erally “for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes, which has enabled bright
and energy-saving white light sources.”
Before we get to the realization of an efficient blue LED, we should shed light on a
further important invention, which was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics 2000,
the double heterostructure junction, which made LEDs substantially more efficient. Here,
the relevant section of the LED where the light generation occurs, where holes and elec￾trons combine was modified in a way that the band gap was slightly reduced. In this junc￾tion, between n- and p-type semiconductor, holes and electrons are collected since the
holes strive for higher, the electrons for lower energies as depicted in Figure 8.24. This
approach was employed in the actual blue LEDs by introduction of an indium-doped
section. Indium nitride’s band gap is somewhat smaller than that of gallium nitride and,
therefore, the heterostructure was tuned to a band gap of 2.9 eV corresponding to bright

blue light of 430 nm—and an emission band lying fully in the visible regime. A pure gal￾lium nitride LED would have an emission predominantly in the u. v. with 365 nm. So, the
blue light output was optimized here, as well as the efficiency of the LED as such.
The two main problems to solve where the lattice mismatch of gallium nitride
with the sapphire substrate and the p-doping of gallium nitride. The lattice mismatch
amounts to 16 % between wurtzite-type GaN and sapphire, i. e., Al2O3
. Consequently,
during crystal growth many defects are generated impeding efficient semiconducting
properties. To overcome this defect formation, a novel two-flow metal-organic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD) process was developed. Here, the CVD process starting from
trimethylgallium and ammonia according to

is improved by introducing a secondary flow of chemical vapor perpendicular to the
substrate plane according to Figure 8.24. This applies pressure to the tangential flow
against the surface. Hence, an almost perfect gallium nitride or aluminium nitride buffer
layer grows on the substrate [350, 351].
The second problem, the p-doping, was chemically even more challenging. Every
contamination with oxygen yields an n-doping according to GdN:O where each oxygen
atom replacing nitrogen contributes a surplus electron. Therefore, as-made gallium ni￾tride is n-doped. The actual p-doping is usually made by doping the gallium sites with an
element of group 2 such as magnesium. An important discovery was that due to the pres￾ence of hydrogen during the CVD process actually a codoped GaN:Mg,H with additional
hydrogen atoms was formed, and that under a subsequent annealing in nitrogen/hydro￾gen atmosphere these hydrogen atoms remained in the material, which clarified one
of the main remaining problems on the way to an efficient blue LED [352]. Since then,
the material is finally annealed in a pure nitrogen instead of a nitrogen/hydrogen at￾mosphere above 700 °C, which dramatically enhanced the hole mobility as the doped
hydrogen just evaporates. This marked a crucial breakthrough, the successful p-doping
according to GaN:Mg was accomplished [353]. A typical doping concentration amounts170 � 8 Optical Properties
to 2 ⋅10−18 cm−3
or approximately 23 ppm magnesium. The same result was achieved by
electron beam irradiation of the GaN:Mg,H raw material [354].
The last step was the realization of a double heterostructure junction by employing
trimethylindium to obtain an indium-gallium nitride section, i. e., InxGa1-xN. Also here,
the development of the two-flow MOCVD solved the problem of an active layer rich in
defects, which until then prevented any luminescence at room temperature [355]. Even￾tually, in 1994 the first tunable bright blue InxGa1-xN LED was presented [356]. It is still
tricky to tune the band gap of this emitting section finely. So, from LED to LED the band
gap may vary yielding somewhat different blue tones.
So, 1994 was the actual starting point, from where efficient white light emitting
diodes came on the agenda. To realize such a white LED, phosphors were needed to
convert the blue LED light partially into the remaining colors of the visible spectrum.
Covering the blue LED with a thin layer of Y3Al2
(AlO4
)

:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce3+) yielded a quick
approach to the first white LED following the color scheme in Figure 8.25. YAG:Ce3+ ab￾sorbs efficiently in the blue and shows a very broad-banded emission from yellow to
orange (Figure 8.21). Figure 8.25 shows the color coordinates as defined in Chapter 7.7.3
of a blue LED (a) and YAG:Ce3+ (b). The broken connection line between both points rep￾resents all possible colours such a coated LED might display. It apparently intersects the
bold line of the black body radiator in the regime of white light. An even broader regime
is accessible if the blue LED is coated by a green emitting (c) and an orange emitting phos￾phor (d) since then the whole triangle spanned by the broken lines may be displayed.
Examples for such phosphors like Ba2

With the former concept based on blue LED and YAG:Ce3+ only white LEDs gener￾ating cold white light with high color temperatures corresponding to the black body ra￾diator can be realized while the latter approach enables the more reddish warm white
light generation with lower color temperatures. Moreover, the shown emission spec￾trum of such a white LED more or less resembles the solar emission spectrum and should8.7 Further Divalent Rare-Earth Ions � 171
be perceived as natural [348]. Further developments might lead to u. v. LEDs based on
aluminium gallium nitride, AlxGa1-xN, which then has to be coated with three efficient
phosphors converting u. v. into visible light. Because more energy would have to sup￾plied for this approach, it is less energy saving than the former. However, this design
would also solve the problem that each blue LED shows a slightly different blue hue as
then solely the phosphor mixture determined the emission color of the white LED. But
on the other hand, the goal of the United Nations to save even more energy would be
harder to achieve.
8.7 Further Divalent Rare-Earth Ions
First reports about divalent rare-earth ions date back to the 1930s. Certainly, primarily
divalent europium was identified as an efficient emitter, but also Yb2+ and Sm2+ were
mentioned and believed to be the only stable ones beside Eu2+. Later, also divalent
thulium was thoroughly investigated [357, 358]. Interestingly, but not surprising, these
are indeed the most stable ones. The synthesis of such phosphors can be challenging in
most cases. But occasionally, even syntheses under ambient atmosphere were reported,
such as the doping of Sr[B4O7
] with Eu2+, Yb2+, Sm2+ and even Tm2+ on the strontium
site [359]. Here, presumably the comparably large site size for trivalent ions stabilized
the larger R2+. Usually, the reduction even with hydrogen fails and a metallothermic
reduction yields the respective divalent halide.
Because of the lower charge, the electronic situation for the divalent cations is quite
different to that of the trivalent ones. Figure 8.26 shows an enlarged extract of the chem￾ical shift model scrutinized in Chapter 8.3 based on the same data. In Figure 7.9, we thor￾oughly discussed the difference of low- and high-spin 5d states. The same holds for the
divalent lanthanide ions as depicted here also in the chemical shift model. Important
for possible applications is that in the second-half of the rare-earth series the lowest
lying high-spin 5d states feature comparably long lifetimes as the relaxation to the 4f
Figure 8.26: Chemical shift model of the divalent states only (left) and the energy differences of the lowest
high- and low-spin 5d states and the ground 4f states of the free Ln2+ (right) calculated based on the data
provided in [252].172 � 8 Optical Properties
ground state is spin forbidden. Therefore, like the late trivalent R3+, up-conversion is a
topic here. For the interpretation of spectra, it is also important, that the lower charge
of R2+ yields a smaller splitting of the 4f levels, approximately 10 to 30 % lower than the
figures given in the Dieke diagram as these were set up for R3+
.
The trends of relative stabilities are vividly reflected by the 5d–4f transition energies
displayed in Figure 8.26. The most stable two, divalent europium and ytterbium, with
the highest 5d–4f transition energies for the naked ions contrast the most unstable ones,
cerium, gadolinium and lanthanum. Some figures are even negative; so, in these cases in
divalent compounds an electron enters the conduction band forming a hidden trivalent
ion according to R3+
⋅ e
–
.
In aqueous solution, only Eu2+ survives a longer treatment. But in the solid state
several divalent, and I mean really divalent, cations could be stabilized. Certainly, also
divalent europium endures the handling of most of its solid compounds in air. Further,
reasonably stable ions are Yb2+, Tm2+ and Sm2+. As a rule of thumb may act the color of
their halides. The most stable EuCl2
and YbCl2
are colorless and apparently absorb only
in the u. v. regime. This corresponds to a high stability of R2+ since the excitation of an
electron into the conduction band yielding a R3+ requires a comparably high energy; the
less stable a R2+ the less energy is needed for such transitions as observed for the follow￾ing examples. TmCl2
and SmCl2
are described as dark red. Hence, they show absorption
in the green. Further black chlorides—absorbing the whole visible regime—are DyCl2
and NdCl2
[112, 360].
The maybe most important trivalent rare-earth ion, Eu3+, finds its sister in Sm2+ be￾ing isoelectronic ([Xe]4f6
). The lower charge generally leads to a lower splitting of all 4f
states as described in Chapter 7.8; accordingly, the sharp 4f–4f emission 5D0→7
F0
occurs
around 690 nm as discussed in the course of the possible application in optical memo￾ries (Chapter 8.4.4). Moreover, it can be well excited in the u. v. via 5d←4f excitations.
Because of the energetically closer 5d states a mixing of the excited state, 5D0
seems
reasonable. Hence, the essentially forbidden 5D0→7
F0
transition becomes quite intense
in Sm2+, in striking contrast to its sister ion. Sm2+ has almost the same size than Eu2+
and it can therefore be applied for the investigation of host structures doped with Eu2+
(Appendix A). Because the transition 5D0→7
F0
always occurs as a single line, it can be
employed to determine the number of chemically different sites occupied by europium.
These facts already suggest that the 5d–4f emission, for which the ions are expected to
be prominent, is not as frequent or relevant as for Ce3+ and Eu2+
.
Divalent thulium is isoelectronic with Yb3+ ([Xe]4f13), and thus basically interest￾ing for up-conversion processes. This was indeed proven on several examples, e. g., in
SrCl2
:Tm2+ where up-conversion could even be realized employing a xenon lamp, and in
CsCaI3
:Tm2+, where it reached an efficiency of 11 % [361, 362]. This extraordinarily high
efficiency for an infrared to visible up-conversion became possible because of partici￾pation of the highly efficient 5d←4f excitation into high-spin 5d states. Quite recently,
the doped halides NaI:Tm2+, CaBr2
:Tm2+ and CaI2
:Tm2+ were identified as possible solar
luminescent concentrator for the application on windows. Sputtered as thin films on8.7 Further Divalent Rare-Earth Ions � 173
normal window glass, these materials absorb a part of the incoming light and convert it
into infrared radiation. Divalent thulium absorbs here via a 5d←4f excitation. The then
emitted infrared radiation around 1140 nm remains trapped in the glass and is totally
reflected therein until it is converted at the edges of the window into electricity by solar
cells embedded there. Since Tm2+ absorbs uniformly over the entire visible spectrum,
the otherwise inevitable coloring of the glass by selectively absorbing phosphors can be
avoided [363].
Trivalent ytterbium is the spectroscopic twin of Ce3+. In contrast to the latter, no
5d–4f emissions are relevant here. Adding an electron, yielding Yb2+ with a fully oc￾cupied 4f14 shell, only 5d–4f transitions are possible. The 5d–4f energy difference is
slightly larger for Yb2+ compared with Eu2+ (Figure 8.26). Further, the ligand-field and
nephelauxetic effects on the 5d states are very similar for all Ln2+ as they are for Ln3+
.
Hence, the luminescence properties of both, Eu2+ and Yb2+, are quite similar. The critical
difference is the high-spin 5d states acting somehow as traps and generally leading to
long lifetimes and slightly lower efficiencies, though. For instance, for Sr[Si2O2N2
]:Yb2+
a good quantum efficiency with a red emission around 620 nm was reported [364]. For
Sr[Si2O2N2
]:Eu2+, a green emission around 540 nm was reported (p. 165 and [343]). The
initial remarks would suggest a slightly blue-shifted emission of the ytterbium com￾pound due to the clearly higher nuclear charge. Presumably, here the 5d states are al￾ready situated in the conduction band. As mentioned before, 5d and conduction band
states may mix very efficiently, in strong contrast to the well-shielded 4f states. There￾fore, the excitation actually occurs indeed into the conduction band, a situation like that
depicted in Figure 8.26 (left). Hence, the emission occurs not via a 5d→4f emission but
from a so-called impurity trapped exciton state. This is a similar situation as described
for storage phosphors, but here with a very flat trap state. Such anomalous emissions
can be proven by measuring the photoconductivity upon excitation. Finally, thermal
quenching is already relevant at room temperature for the ytterbium compound while
for the europium compound up to 200 °C no significant thermal quenching was no￾ticed [364].9 Magnetism
In this chapter, I will discuss selected magnetic properties of the rare-earth elements and
their compounds. Due to the vast spectrum of meanwhile acquired property details and
their applications, this selection has to be incomplete but aims to trigger interest and en￾able the reader for further self-studies on these topics. Therefore, I will first summarize
relevant basics and then treat the properties of selected compounds as well as relevant
applications.
9.1 Basic Principles
Magnetism describes the reaction of any medium upon exposure to an external mag￾netic field. For a proper understanding, some relevant parameters have to be defined
and understood as described in a typical textbook [365]. An external magnetic field is a
vector H typically caused in a coil by the flow of an electric current. It is usually given
as amperes per meter, i. e., A/m, and thus defined by its origin. It causes a magnetic in￾duction or flux density B, which is related to the magnetic field via
B = μ0H (9.1)

, (9.2)
if the coil is empty. As soon as matter is positioned inside the coil, it experiences a dif￾ferent flux density modified by its individual magnetization M according to
B = μ0
(H + M) (9.3)
and usually also given in A/m like H. This different flux density is caused by the pres￾ence of electrons within the matter, which themselves are induced to local currents by
the external field causing magnetic fields, and thus contribute to the flux density. As￾suming that the matter under consideration is magnetically isotropic, M and H can only
be parallel or antiparallel, and accordingly follow the relationships:
M = χH (9.4)
80 The actual value may be found on a NIST website (https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?mu0)
based on the CODATA recommended values; the given value was actual in December 2023.

or
μ0M = χB0

if one considers B0 = μ0H as an external magnetic induction and includes the dimension￾less magnetic volume susceptibility χ, which is zero in vacuum. Combining the previous
Equations (9.3) and (9.4), which yields
B = μ0

after introduction of the dimensionless relative permeability according to
μr = 1 + χ, (9.7)
which amounts to one in vacuum. Any the magnetic field disturbing bound and paired
electrons within matter cause magnetizations with opposite direction with respect to
the external field, thus weakening the measured flux density in accordance with a neg￾ative contribution to χ. Such diamagnetic contributions have to be considered for every
material; materials with a negative χ with typical values below −10−4
and μr < 1 are
called diamagnetic materials. Superconductivity reduces μr
to zero, and thus an ideal
diamagnet is achieved. For practical reasons instead of the volume susceptibility χ, nor￾mally the molar susceptibility

(9.8)
and sometimes the mass susceptibility
χρ =

(9.9)
employing the material’s density ρ and molar mass Mr are used.
Since in literature different unit systems are in use, I add this paragraph on the most common unit sys￾tems, the International System of Units, SI and the Gaussian cgs (centimeter-gram-second) system. For
instance, in Equation (9.2) μ0
is given in SI units. In Gaussian units μ0 = 1, H is given there in Oersted and
B in Gauss. Table 9.1 lists selected electromagnetism units in the SI and Gaussian systems including their
conversion factors.
If unpaired or conducting, i. e., itinerant, electrons are present in a material, local cur￾rents are induced, which cause local magnetic fields. These act as local magnets and
are oriented along the direction of the external field, contrary to diamagnetic materials.
Such paramagnetic contributions contribute positively to χ, and accordingly materials
with positive χ and μr > 1 are called paramagnetic materials.176 � 9 Magnetism

Due to their electronic structure especially inner and outer transition metal atoms
often feature such unpaired electrons localized in the respective 4f or nd shell fre￾quently. In contrast to main-group elements, the number of unpaired electrons can be
higher and these unpaired electrons are normally stable; thus, they are highly suited for
magnetic applications. Among these, lanthanide elements may show the highest num￾bers of unpaired electrons since here seven 4f orbitals offer space for up to seven lone
electrons while the five d orbitals only provide at maximum five lone electrons. Such
atoms exhibit permanent magnetic moments and actually behave like atomic magnets.
The volume susceptibility of this Curie paramagnetism81 typically lies in the regime
between +10−5
and +10−2
for inner and outer transition metal atoms with unpaired
electrons.
Certainly, as soon as such materials show electronic conductivity, this will also cause
rather weak paramagnetic contributions of itinerant electrons called Pauli paramag￾netism.82 Under certain circumstances, otherwise diamagnetic ions may show a weak
and temperature independent paramagnetism by mixing of the diamagnetic ground
state with other magnetic states. This is called Van Vleck paramagnetism83. Paramag￾netic behavior is only a short term magnetization of a material, which requires an active
external magnetic field. After turning off the external field, any magnetization vanishes
quickly.
An external magnetic field may also induce magnetic ordering, which remains in
the material below the respective ordering temperature, such as ferromagnetism, anti￾ferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism. Normally, for these magnetically ordered materials
the simple relationships between H, B and M become field dependent. The relative per￾meability μr may adopt values up to 106
for ferromagnets. Moreover, if materials behave
magnetically nonisotropic, these field vectors are no longer necessarily parallel.

9.2 Paramagnetism
If exposed to an external magnetic field, the atomic magnets in a material strive to align
parallel to the external magnetic field vector. This competes with thermal motion, which
randomizes any ordering. Accordingly, the macroscopic magnetization increases with
decreasing temperature. This magnetization is the sum of all projections of the mag￾netic moments of the atoms present in the sample under consideration with respect to
the external field. This causes the aforementioned positive contribution to the magnetic
susceptibility. Hence, the Curie law81 describes the reciprocal dependence of the molar
susceptibility from the absolute temperature
χmol =

(9.10)
with the Curie constant C yielding a line intersecting the origin. Consequently, respective
plots display χ
−1
mol versus T. With decreasing temperature and increasing field strength,
the macroscopic magnetization will increasingly approach a saturation magnetization
Ms
. Therefore, Equation (9.10) is only applicable for weak fields and not too low tem￾peratures. Moreover, the simple Curie law only holds for sufficiently separated atomic
magnets, which do not interact with each other. To consider interactions within para￾magnetic materials, Weiss84 generalized this law by adding the Weiss constant or Curie
temperature Θp
to the denominator according to the Curie–Weiss law

where the line intersects the abscissa at T = Θp
. Given the case that ferromagnetic in￾teractions, where the atomic moments align along the same direction, increase the sus￾ceptibility at low temperatures, a positive Θp will be found. In case of dominating anti￾ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures, where the atomic magnets align with
opposite orientation, a negative Θp will be found. The overall discussion of Curie con￾stants and temperatures is only reliable if atomic moments with a defined electronic
configuration and sufficiently thermally isolated ground states contribute.
Looking at transition metal atoms as atomic magnets, these experience interactions
with surrounding atoms and ligands. This latter interaction includes ligand-field effects,
dubbed 𝒣lf, which according to our previous discussion in Chapter 2.1 is in the context
of this chapter not relevant for rare-earth ions. This is in strong contrast to that of outer
transition metals, which will be treated in Chapter 9.2.3. The main reason for this lies in
the electronic structure, where the 4f valence electrons are well shielded by the filled

shell against neighboring atoms. Moreover, the spin-orbit coupling 𝒣so is less rele￾vant for rare-earth ions than the electron-electron interactions 𝒣ee. Due to the relatively

low spin-orbit coupling for rare-earth ions, the Russel–Saunders coupling scheme can
be employed to derive the ground state term symbols. Hence, rare-earth ions can in
first and often very good approximation be treated as individual atomic magnets based
on their respective ground states as listed in Tables 7.1 and 9.2. Langevin85 derived via

, we need the ground state term symbols of the contributing
molecular magnets. The term symbols deliver the quantum numbers L, S and J. Since
the coupling strength of electron spins and their angular moments is different in inner,
the rare-earth elements, and outer transition metals, the d-block elements, I will focus
first on the former, then shortly also on the latter.

external field was conducted to scrutinize a possible ordering at low temperatures in
zero-field cooling (zfc) and field-cooling mode (Figure 9.1, right). During the former, the
sample was cooled without an external magnetic field, in the latter the sample was
cooled under application of an external field. In the case of magnetic ordering, both
measurements would deliver different results as in the latter the spins are already ori￾ented during cooling and yield a higher magnetization while in the former the spins are
oriented randomly in the beginning. If—like here—both curves coincide, no ordering
is deduced.
This book focuses on 4f elements. Looking at 5f elements, things become signifi￾cantly more complicated as here 𝒣ee ≈ 𝒣so ≈ 𝒣lf and the expected magnetic moments
are difficult to estimate.
9.2.2 Van Vleck Paramagnetism
The discussion so far assumes that only the magnetic ground state contributes to the
magnetic behavior. But already at low temperatures excited states with differing mag￾netic moments may also be thermally populated if they are sufficiently close in en￾ergy, i. e., within kBT. A view on Figures 7.8 and 8.10 (Chapters 7.8 and 8.4.4) discloses
that regarding the trivalent rare-earth ions only Eu3+ and Sm3+ should show tempera￾ture independent paramagnetism. This effect is influenced by state broadenings caused
by ligand-field effects, for instance. Accordingly, a temperature independent contribu￾tion to a magnetic susceptibility has to be considered in such cases, dubbed Van Vleck9.2 Paramagnetism � 181

9.2.3 Outer Transition Metals
Earlier in this chapter, it was stated that d block elements, also dubbed outer transition
metals, behave differently regarding ligand-field strength 𝒣lf than inner transition met￾als. The obvious reason for this is that the relevant valence electrons in the d shell are not
shielded against the ligands, which therefore directly interact with the d orbitals. Hence,
𝒣lf competes with the electron-electron interactions 𝒣ee while the spin-orbit coupling
𝒣so is less relevant here, especially for the 3d elements, and the Russel–Saunders cou￾pling scheme can be employed to derive the ground state term symbols. Due to the very
weak spin-orbit coupling, the magnetism of such outer transition metals can mainly be
treated as pure spin paramagnetism.
In the case of weak ligand-fields, 𝒣ee > 𝒣lf, the atoms behave magnetically like the
free atoms—like the inner transition metals. Assuming pure spin paramagnetism (L = 0
and J = S), the g factor simplifies to 2 (Equation (9.17)). Then the squared magnetic
moment μ
2
of Equation (9.12) is obtained via

(9.27)
with the Bohr magneton μB
(Equation (9.16)). This expression agrees very well with neff
values (Equation (9.14)) found for configurations 3d1
through 3d5
and well with the re￾maining ones due to increasing spin-orbit coupling leading to slightly higher figures.
The highest magnetization amounts analogously Equation (9.19) to
nmax = 2S. (9.28)9.3 Magnetic Ordering � 183
Thus, the highest possible magnetizations are expected for 3d5
configurations like Mn2+
with nmax = 5, which is only half the value expected for the best rare-earth configura￾tions 4f9
and 4f10 according to Table 9.2.
In case of strong ligand-fields, 𝒣ee < 𝒣lf, spin-pairing may occur. This results in low￾spin configurations and lower magnetic moments. Stronger ligand-fields are observed
in case of 3d elements with strong ligands, and in case of 4d and 5d elements in almost all
cases as the latter orbitals are comparably diffuse and, therefore, yield strong interac￾tion with any ligand, and consequently, large ligand-field splittings. Moreover, the more
diffuse the orbitals under consideration are, the weaker the interelectronic repulsion
becomes further fostering spin-pairing.
9.3 Magnetic Ordering
Below sufficiently low temperatures, the atomic magnets may interact with their neigh￾bors via exchange interactions. These may occur by direct interaction of the respec￾tive orbitals comprising unpaired electrons or by indirect interaction either via bridg￾ing ligands called superexchange (Figure 9.3). Alternatively, exchange interactions are
achieved via conduction electrons, which are those close to the Fermi level in metals.
With exception of the latter, which will be discussed in Chapter 9.3.2, such exchange in￾teractions are restricted to small distances, typically up to the next but one neighbors.
Below a critical ordering temperature Tc adjacent spins strive to align parallel or antipar￾allel if possible generating a long-range ordered magnetic structure. The exchange in￾teraction may be ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic. Among these, the
practically most important are ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. Experimentally,
this phase change may be elucidated not only via magnetic measurements but also via
neutron diffraction or heat capacity measurements. In Figure 9.3, the antiferromagnetic
coupling of two gadolinium atoms occurs via an occupied p orbital of a bridging nitro￾gen atom, a situation found in the rocksalt structure of GdN displayed in Figure 6.20. For
the quantitative description of such exchange interactions models have been developed.

The Heisenberg model87 can be employed if the considered material is nonmetallic, i. e.,
the magnetism is well localized, and if the Russel–Saunders coupling scheme is appli￾cable for description of the electronic states. The herein discussed rare-earth elements
as well as the elements included in relevant examples like main-group and 3d elements
fulfill at least the latter condition. Furthermore, the valence shell configurations of par￾ticipating inner and outer transition metals should be close to half-occupied like Eu2+
or Gd3+, which is the case for the discussion in Chapter 9.5 on GdN and the europium
chalcogenides. For a more thorough derivation and discussion of the Heisenberg model,
refer to more specialized literature. The relevant details regarding the purpose in this
book are the Heisenberg exchange parameters J

a low-spin configuration.

88 is illustrated in Figure 9.3. It consists of deficient closely packed layers of copper atoms (dark
red), in which every fourth atom is removed; these so-called Kagomé nets are packed in a cubic close
packed manner indicated as A, B and C in Figure 9.3. In a quarter of the generated octahedral voids, fur￾ther copper atoms (bright green) are situated. Thus, Cu4
tetrahedra are generated. The barycenters of
these tetrahedra form a diamond-like network, which interpenetrates with a diamond-like network of Mg
atoms. Hereby, the magnesium atoms are surrounded tetrahedrally by four magnesium and twelve cop￾per atoms; the copper atoms are coordinated by six copper and six magnesium atoms. This structure type
is usually adopted by intermetallic compounds where the atomic radii of both elements are sufficiently
different. For the basics of this structure related to others, see also Appendix D.
9.3.1 Ferromagnetism and Antiferromagnetism
Even without an external magnetic field, exchange interactions between adjacent mag￾netic dipoles yield domains of as parallel as possible aligned dipoles in ferromagnets,
so-called magnetic domains—in German literature also Weiss domains84 is used. The
size of these naturally forming domains is limited because each of these domains gener￾ates their own strong magnetic field and—given there is only a single domain—spreads

88 Fritz Laves, German mineralogist and crystallographer (*1906 †1978).9.3 Magnetic Ordering � 185
outside itself. This is energetically not favored due to magnetostatic reasons; accord￾ingly, large domains split into smaller ones with differing magnetic orientation until a
resulting magnetic field outside the material under consideration vanishes. Such do￾mains have a typical size in the order of 10−6
to 10−4
µm [371].
Below the Curie temperature TC adjacent magnetic domains seek a parallel align￾ment with the external field. In ferromagnetically ordering rare-earth compounds, the
saturation magnetization Ms
is closely related to the respective 4fn
configuration, re￾gardless of the material being metallic, semiconducting intermetallic or electronically
isolating. Hereby, a decreasing total spin S correlates with a decreasing TC
. For instance,
the magnetic data of selected RIr2
listed in Table 9.4 show this dependence. For iridium,
no relevant magnetic moment can be estimated; they all crystallize in the MgCu2
type
structure and can therefore be compared easily.

Ferromagnetic ordering is identified by a strong increase of the magnetic suscep￾tibility around TC as shown in Figure 9.4 on the example of Eu2
[Si5N8
], which turns
ferromagnetic around 13 K. In the field cooling mode, the steeply increasing ordering
can be well seen, and the zero field cooling curve shows strong ordering with increas￾ing temperature until 13 K. The inverse magnetic susceptibility develops like a normal
paramagnet above 50 K and turns close to zero at 13 K. The magnetization isotherm ap￾proaches the expected saturation magnetization of approx. 7 μB at high magnetic fields
and a temperature below TC = 13 K; above TC
the magnetization is much weaker as here

no long-range ordering can be achieved and the structure of small domains is restored
immediately.
After an initial magnetization in ferromagnets magnetic ordering remains even
when the external magnetic field is switched off and as long as T < TC
. This is illus￾trated by hysteresis loops like those shown in Figure 9.5, where the response of the mag￾netic induction B of the ferromagnet to a local magnetic field H is displayed. The initial
magnetization curve is shown as a broken line with increasing field strength until the
saturation magnetization Ms
is achieved (point S). Here, all domains are aligned par￾allel to the external field. Moreover, domain boundaries move or are even destroyed.
After switching off the external magnetic field, the aforementioned magnetostatic rea￾sons reduce the parallel alignment to the remanent magnetization, and the remanence
(R) persists. Crystal defects and grain boundaries prevent further demagnetization and
stabilize a permanent magnetization. To actually demagnetize the ferromagnet, an ex￾ternal field corresponding to the coercive field Hc or coercivity (–C) has to be applied in
the opposite direction. By further increasing the external field in the opposite direction
again saturation is achieved (–S) after switching off the field again a remanence (–R)
persists; a further magnetization then closes the loop ending again at point S. The area
the hysteresis loop encloses corresponds to an energy loss per volume, i. e., the product
of flux density and magnetic field according to Table 9.1. This energy matches the energy
needed to perform a single loop. Thus, the left loop in Figure 9.5 represents that of a soft
ferromagnet, the right that of a hard ferromagnet. Soft magnets are rather easily mag￾netized, demagnetized and magnetically switched. Hard magnets normally need high
fields for magnetization, are harder to switch or to demagnetize and are therefore used
as permanent magnets. Moreover, the maximum energy product BHmax is equivalent to
the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under the hysteresis loop. This is
obviously clearly larger for hard ferromagnets. It is proportional to the magnetostatic
energy stored by the magnet. For these materials combining high Curie temperatures

Most ferromagnets are metallic, but there are also semiconductors or isolators like
the aforementioned Eu2
[Si5N8
] or the chalcogenides EuO and EuS, which will be treated
in Chapter 9.5 since the heavier ones order antiferromagnetically. The pure existence of
semiconducting or isolating ferromagnets was heavily disputed up to the 1960s.
9.3.2 Magnetism of Metallic 4f Systems
The magnetism of outer transition metals is usually described by the effect of spin polar￾ization. Thereby, the electronic states in the band structure of the considered material
deviate in energy regarding the spin orientation of the contained electrons. Accordingly,
the band structure splits into a spin-up and a spin-down set of bands below the respec￾tive ordering temperature Tc
. In this context also, the band gap should decrease at Tc
.
For broad bands, such as s or p bands the spin-polarized split bands of the itinerant
electrons are energetically shifted by applying an external magnetic field with slightly
higher antiparallel (low-spin) and somewhat lower parallel spin alignment (high-spin)
as shown in Figure 9.6. Thus, below the Fermi level empty states in the parallel spin
band result, which are filled by spin-flipped electrons from the antiparallel band. Hence,
a small surplus quantity of parallel spins is generated yielding paramagnetic behav￾ior known as Pauli paramagnetism of itinerant electrons, present for all metals. Broad
bands mean high delocalization and, therefore, this jellium or electron gas approach
Figure 9.6: The darker blue regime illustrates the surplus spins yielding a blue majority spin half-band with
parallel spin alignment and a green minority spin half-band (left); schematic electronic structure of EuO
with spin-polarized half-bands, valence bands show a colored filling while conduction bands only show a
colored edge (right).188 � 9 Magnetism
works very well for broad bands. Within this concept, magnetic ordering of transition
metals cannot be explained.
To understand magnetic ordering of 3d elements under these circumstances, it has
to be considered that 3d bands are significantly narrower than s or p bands, i. e., the
electrons therein are significantly better localized. A closer look on the band structure of
iron reveals that in a nonmagnetic calculation antibonding states around the Fermi level
would be occupied. In such cases, nature usually strives for a distortion of the structure.
In iron, the electronic structure instead of the crystal structure can distort yielding spin￾polarized half-bands, and thus minimizing antibonding interactions around the Fermi
level if shifted with respect to each other. Figure 9.6 shows this understanding on the ex￾ample of EuO, treated below. Then, in the same manner as described for the electron gas
above, some itinerant electrons swap their spins populating the available states in the
stabilized half-band below and depopulate states of the destabilized half-band above the
Fermi level. Due to this local spin polarization, the surplus spin electrons are shielded
worse from the nuclear charges of the adjacent atoms—since the number of electrons
with opposite spin decreased upon spin polarization and, accordingly, this half-band is
energetically stabilized, which is in line with the driving force of this distortion. Finally,
this leads to spontaneous local magnetic ordering within magnetic domains as described
in Chapter 9.3.1. Eventually, these magnetic domains based on the spin-polarized bands
yield bulk magnetic ordering.
Transitioning to the lanthanides, the 4f bands are even narrower than those of 3d
elements, thus even better localized. Accordingly, contrary to the outer transition met￾als, the magnetism of metallic 4f systems not primarily stems from itinerant conduction
electrons but from the highly localized 4f states. The magnetic ordering in rare-earth
metals as well as their metallic derivatives occurs normally via exchange interactions
based on itinerant electrons. So, the magnetism of outer transition metals is based on
itinerant electrons while that of inner transition metals is mediated by itinerant elec￾trons.
The magnetic behavior of conducting rare-earth materials is best understood by
the RKKY model based on groundbreaking contributions of Ruderman,
89 Kasuya,
90 Kit￾tel91 and Yosida92 [374–376]. Due to their specific electronic structure lanthanide atoms,
where the 4f states are well shielded by a filled 5s2
p
6
shell, exhibit pronounced magnetic
moments based on their 4f configuration even in metallic systems. These local moments
polarize the spin densities of the conduction electrons around the Fermi level via a direct
exchange. Accordingly, the spin density of parallel spins is increased and that of antipar￾allel spins is decreased around a magnetically active lanthanide atom. This polarization

affects the neighboring lanthanide atoms and leads to an indirect coupling. Since this
polarization is not restricted to the close neighborhood, but of considerable scope and,
moreover, oscillating, it induces ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling with ad￾jacent lanthanide atoms depending on the distances between the magnetic centers. The
oscillation wavelength depends from the wavelength of the itinerant electrons around
the Fermi level.
9.4 Magnetic Behavior of the Lanthanide metals
The magnetic data of the lanthanide metals are summarized in Table 9.5. Most of the
data were taken from a review in the famous Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry
of Rare-Earths, which nicely summarizes the crucial data [377]. Many details of the mag￾netic properties are—in parts—under severe discussion as the precise description of 4f
electrons by means of theoretical calculations is still challenging. So, I will focus in this
chapter on the basic magnetic properties relevant for most of their applications and the
deeper understanding of lanthanide elements as such.

The discussion will address six main groups of the rare-earth metals. Further, con￾sider also Chapter 3.3 discussing the temperature dependent phases of the rare-earth
metals. The first series starts with terbium, dysprosium and holmium. Since the exchange190 � 9 Magnetism
interaction is believed to be mediated by the conduction electrons it seems reasonable
that also a certain portion of these itinerant electrons become polarized. Accordingly,
the observed magnetization nobs can be larger than the expected nmax based purely on
the unpaired 4f electrons. For instance, for terbium a slightly higher value of 9.33 was
observed. Terbium orders antiferromagnetically at 230 K with a spiral structure of the
spins and then ferromagnetically at 220 K. The antiferromagnetic ordering can also be
turned into a ferromagnetic one by applying a stronger field of 1 T. Terbium metal ex￾hibits a magnetic anisotropy, which can be seen well by looking at the different paramag￾netic Curie temperatures of 195 and 239 K with parallel and perpendicular orientation
with respect to the crystallographic c-axis. This confirms the predominant ferromag￾netic interactions, which are conveniently achieved along the easy direction parallel
the b axis. Above TN terbium shows a simple Curie–Weiss behavior with a magnetic
moment close to the theoretically expected value (Table 9.2). Also, dysprosium adopts a
spiral spin structure in the regime of antiferromagnetic ordering between 178 and 86 K,
where it eventually orders ferromagnetically. Apparently, here the antiferromagnetic
ordering is more resilient. The easy axis here is the a axis. The phase transition at TC
is
apparently first order including a discontinuous development of the lattice parameters
leading also to a structural phase transition as outlined in Chapter 3.3. As observed for
terbium, also here a certain portion of conduction electrons become polarized enhanc￾ing the total magnetization above the pure value expected for the Dy3+ core. Holmium
displays a similar behavior like the aforementioned metals. Below 133 K, it orders anti￾ferromagnetically with a spiral spin structure similar to the other two, switching to a
more fan-like arrangement of the spins and at 19 K it finally turns ferromagnetic. In all
three cases, the spins in the ferromagnetic phase are confined more or less to the basal
plane with the b axis being the easy one. The difference between Θp,‖c and Θp,⊥c
is the
smallest in this series indicative for a decreasing uniaxial magnetic anisotropy.
The second block of similarly behaving erbium and thulium starts with erbium for
which an antiferromagnetic ordering was detected below 84 K. This ordering coincides
with an incommensurate sinusoidally modulated arrangement of the magnetic mo￾ments along the c axis; the wave vector changes smoothly toward the lower ordering
temperature. Below 52 K, the previous ordering is superimposed by a second one, which
is spiral parallel to the basal plane. At 18 K also erbium orders ferromagnetically, the
easy axis is the c axis here. In summary, erbium features the most complicated and
puzzling magnetic properties of the four so far considered metals. In thulium below
56 K, the same antiferromagnetic ordering along the easy c axis is found, but in contrast
to the former no further ordering in the basal plane follows below. Instead, the mod￾ulation changes yielding a ferrimagnetic transition around 32 K where four layers of
moments align parallel and three subsequent layers antiparallel the c axis. Under the
influence of higher fields, this ferrimagnetic phase turns ferromagnetic.
As third group follow the magnetic properties of gadolinium and europium. Due
to its maximum number of unpaired electrons, gadolinium features the highest Curie
temperature of the lanthanide elements. In contrast to the aforementioned metals, no9.4 Magnetic Behavior of the Lanthanide metals � 191
orbital angular moments contribute, the magnetism is apparently purely driven by
spin. Below 293 K, it orders ferromagnetically; also, gadolinium exhibits weak magnetic
anisotropy, with the c axis being easy, despite the absence of orbital angular moments.
Approaching low temperatures, the easy axis slightly tilts toward the basal plane. Really
pure gadolinium is a rather soft ferromagnet—for a definition, see Figure 9.5. Above
400 K, it shows Curie–Weiss behavior and an effective magnetic moment of 7.98 Bohr
magnetons per atom, very close to the theoretical value (Table 9.2). As discussed previ￾ously, europium strives for a half-filled 4f shell, and hence also in the metallic state this
is achieved. Therefore, its core is isoelectronic with that of gadolinium. The main differ￾ence between both are the atomic radii where europium atoms are significantly larger
than gadolinium atoms and, of course, the lower charge of the core (Figure 3.1). Con￾sequently, according to Chapter 8.3 the 5d bands contribute stronger in the europium
case. Due to the larger size and smaller charge the density of states is lower at the Fermi
level for europium. This reduces the indirect exchange interaction with neighboring
europium atoms, and thus also the ordering temperature. Below 91 K, a first-order tran￾sition occurs yielding antiferromagnetic ordering with a spiral spin structure along
the a axis of the body-centered cubic unit cell. Moreover, also the Curie temperature is
clearly lower and no ferromagnetic ordering is achieved without tremendously strong
fields. Due to europium’s high oxygen affinity during any magnetic measurements of
europium compounds a possible contamination with EuO (Chapter 9.5) has to be consid￾ered carefully, which alters the magnetic properties dramatically around its TC = 69 K.
At lower temperatures, EuH2
(TC = 18 K) might produce strange results.
The fourth series covers the light elements praseodymium, neodymium and samar￾ium. As outlined in Chapter 3.3, praseodymium and neodymium adopt the hc structure in
the temperature range interesting here. Accordingly, there are atoms on c (A) and h (B
and C) layers, respectively. Hence, the local electronic structures differ substantially like
the splitting of the J sublevels. Moreover, for understanding the magnetic properties also
thermally populated sublevels are relevant leading to the clearly lower oberserved sat￾uration moments nobs of 2.7 (praseodymium) and 2.2 (neodymium) than expected for the
4f configurations (Table 9.5). Magnetic ordering in praseodymium at low temperatures
has been disputed for decades, but at temperatures far below 1 K antiferromagnetic or￾dering is assumed. For neodymium an antiferromagnetic ordering on the hexagonal sites
below 19 K and on the cubic sites below 8 K was reported. Samarium also adopts a struc￾ture, hhc, where c and h layers alternate (Chapter 3.3). The atoms on hexagonal sites
order antiferromagnetically below 106 K with the moments being aligned along the c
axis. Thereby, two ferromagnetic layers with a spin-up configuration alternate with two
spin-down layers. Below 14 K also the atoms on the cubic sites feature an antiferromag￾netic ordering in the same manner of pairwise ferromagnetic layers. Similar to Eu3+, the
magnetic susceptibilities are influenced by admixtures of excited states, such as 6H7/2,
and bear resemblance to Van Vleck paramagnetism (Chapter 9.2.2).
Cerium and ytterbium form the next group of similar elements. The magnetic behav￾ior of cerium was already briefly discussed in Chapter 3.4. Similar to cerium, ytterbium192 � 9 Magnetism
also oscillates between two electron configurations, a diamagnetic and a paramagnetic.
Therefore, it is not surprising that a structural phase transition with wide hysteresis is
also observed in ytterbium. Here, between 100 and 360 K the structure glides with in￾creasing temperature from the hexagonal close to the cubic close packing (Chapter 3.3).
In the case of cerium, the tetravalent state is diamagnetic, while in ytterbium, it is the
divalent state. During this phase transition, apparently, a portion of the ytterbium atoms
shifts from the divalent to the paramagnetic trivalent state. Hence, the cubic close pack￾ing shows a temperature dependent paramagnetism. So, cerium is not only the spectro￾scopic, but also the magnetic twin of ytterbium.
The final group covers the elements lanthanum and lutetium as well as the rare￾earth elements scandium and yttrium. All of them lack a partially filled 4f shell. So their
magnetism shows contributions of itinerant electrons and diamagnetic susceptibilities
of the core electrons. Yttrium, lanthanum and lutetium show typical diamagnetic be￾havior. Therefore, their susceptibilities are very sensitive to impurities like lanthanide
atoms. For scandium the largest susceptibility within this group was determined, fol￾lowed by yttrium and the remaining two. Scandium exhibits paramagnetism in agree￾ment with the Curie-Weiss law with an effective moment neff of 1.65 μB per atom; this
aligns with a quite localized single 3d electron, in accordance with the discussion in
Chapter 2.1 on the special situation of orbitals without radial nodes. The paramagnetic
Curie temperature of −850 K suggests antiferromagnetic interactions.
9.5 The Europium Chalcogenides, Antiferromagnetism and
Ferrimagnetism
Magnetic ordering where adjacent magnetic moments of the same magnitude do not
align parallel but antiparallel occurs in antiferromagnets. If the magnitudes of the op￾posing magnetic moments are different, a net magnetic moment results; such ordering
is named ferrimagnetic. The ordering temperature is named here Néel temperature TN,
93
below of which the magnetic moment vanishes completely or almost.
A prominent example are the europium chalcogenides EuX (X = Se, Te), which in
contrast to their oxygen and sulfur counterparts show antiferromagnetic and ferrimag￾netic ordering while the former order ferromagnetically [378, 381]. Accordingly, the eu￾ropium chalcogenides are a suited series of compounds to discuss the underlying or￾dering mechanism. Moreover, all four representatives adopt a simple crystal structure,
the rocksalt type. Magnetic measurements confirm that divalent europium is present in
line with a composition Eu2+X
2 – . Gadolinium nitride, GdN, can be also be considered
in this discussion as both rare-earth ions, Gd3+ and Eu2+, are isoelectronic and GdN is
93 Louis Néel, French physicist (*1904 †2000).9.5 The Europium Chalcogenides, Antiferromagnetism and Ferrimagnetism � 193
isostructural with EuX. It should be noted that it is challenging to obtain pure GdN with￾out contaminations of oxygen, which strongly influences the electronic structure and
certainly also the magnetic properties.
On the example of EuO, Figure 9.6 depicts both sets of spin-polarized half-bands. Lo￾cally, an exchange splitting of 0.6 eV into spin-polarized half-bands occurs with the blue
bands representing a parallel spin alignment with respect to neighboring europium
ions—the majority spins—and the green bands representing antiparallel minority
spins. The 4f states of europium experience the most prominent exchange splitting of
ca. 10 eV. In the blue set, the 4f half-band, highly localized and, therefore, showing a
very small band dispersion, form the top of the valence band at the Fermi level EF
. The
bottom of the conduction band comprises 5d and 6s bands of Eu2+; the latter features a
very broad dispersion, the former splits according to the ligand-field splitting in an oc￾tahedral environment yielding a t2g and a eg band. An important result of the exchange
splitting of the half-bands is that upon long-range magnetic ordering the band gap
decreases. In the case of EuO, it then at least approaches a semiconductor-to-metal tran￾sition; for GdN, there is an ongoing discussion whether or not it turns metallic below TC
.
Figure 9.7 illustrates the schematic electronic structure of the europium chalcogenides
and gadolinium nitride. Optical reflection measurements confirm that all chalcogenides
are semiconductors above the respective ordering temperature Tc
[378]. Crucial for the
understanding of the magnetic behavior are only the bands around the Fermi level.
Hence, in Figure 9.7 for further comparison only the blue majority spin half-bands
are shown. Because GdN shows a quite comparable magnetic behavior with EuO it is
included here.

while conduction bands only show a colored edge.194 � 9 Magnetism
EuO orders ferromagnetically at TC = 69 K. Its magnetic moment amounts to
neff = 6.94, close to the theoretically expected value of divalent europium of nB = 7.94
(Table 9.2). EuS exhibits essentially the same behavior, just at lower temperatures of
TC = 17 K. A direct exchange interaction of the 4f7
shell of neighboring europium ions
is not reasonable due to the high localization and excellent screening by the filled
5s2
p
6
shell; instead, the ferromagnetic coupling occurs via the energetically close 5d
bands, which extend over longer ranges in the structure and enable for sure such a
cation-cation superexchange between adjacent europium ions as soon as an electron
is temporarily excited from the local 4f states to the 5d band, which then is polarized
by the magnetic moment. In the row oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium the elec￾tronegativity decreases and the size of the X2 – anions increases, in line with increasing
lattice parameters (Table 9.6). Therefore, the ligand-field splitting—based on electro￾static interactions—decreases along this row, the nephelauxetic effect increases slightly,
though. In summary, the oxide features the smallest band gap, which then increases un￾til the telluride. With the increasing band gap, the ferromagnetic coupling path via the
5d states is weakened in the same series. The ferromagnetic ordering in GdN is believed
to work in a similar way although here the 4f states are localized at much lower ener￾gies well below the Fermi level; here, the 4f7
valence electrons again spin-polarize the
itinerant electrons in the 5d band, which then spin-polarize the neighboring gadolinium
ions. Moreover, an antiferromagnetic superexchange via 2p bands seemingly does not
play a role as the gap between these and the 4f states is too large [382]. As mentioned
earlier in Chapters 8.3 and 8.4.1, the higher charge of Gd3+ compared with Eu2+ yields a
strikingly different electronic structure.

Due to the decreasing electronegativity, the chalcogenide p bands and the 4f states
of europium converge within the row EuO, EuS, EuSe and EuTe. Thus, in EuSe and EuTe
significant mixing of these 4f states with 4p and 5p states of selenide and telluride oc￾curs [370, 380, 383]. This mixing enables an increasing antiferromagnetic coupling of9.6 Rare-Earth Ferromagnets—Often Really Hard and Permanent � 195
neighboring Eu2+ ions via a superexchange mediated by the chalcogenide anions. This
is nicely reflected in the relative contribution of the coupling constants J
1 and J2
listed
in Table 9.6.
The Heisenberg exchange constant J
1
relates to the ferromagnetic interaction of ad￾jacent europium ions via the 5d band as discussed above while J2
relates to the antifer￾romagnetic superexchange via the chalcogenides’ p states [384]. In the oxide and sul￾phide J
1 dominates, for the telluride J2 prevails over J
1
. Following these data, for EuO
and EuS ferromagnetic and for EuTe antiferromagnetic ordering is expected. Indeed,
for EuTe antiferromagnetic ordering below 9 K was found. Neutron scattering was em￾ployed to determine the magnetic structure. These investigations showed the presence
of ferromagnetically ordered layers perpendicular the threefold axis in the cubic unit
cell, which are pairwise antiferromagnetically coupled.
Regarding the selenide, the Heisenberg constants do not show a clear preference
for either ordering mechanism, and accordingly EuSe shows a complicated magnetic
behavior [385]. It turns antiferromagnetic below 5 K (antiferromagnetic phase 1), then
below approximately 3 K ferrimagnetic and below 2 K again antiferromagnetic (antifer￾romagnetic phase 2). With increasing external field the antiferromagnetic phases be￾come ferrimagnetic and eventually even ferromagnetic. Such behavior, where the mag￾netic ordering is also field dependent, is called metamagnetic. In the case of EuSe, this
behavior can be expected as the Curie temperature is positive, and ferromagnetic inter￾actions dominate above TN.
9.6 Rare-Earth Ferromagnets—Often Really Hard and Permanent
Permanent magnets are employed in a manifold of applications such as wind genera￾tors, car motors, computer hard-disk drives, loudspeakers and microphones. Applica￾tions like electric vehicle traction in cars or trains and aerospace thrusters require sta￾bilities of permanent magnets of up to 200 and 500 °C, respectively [386, 387]. Further
applications of ferromagnets are multiferroic materials or as magnetocaloric materials,
the latter will be introduced in the following chapter [388, 389]. Essentially, permanent
magnets are hard ferromagnets. Preconditions for good permanent magnets are a high
saturation magnetization, a high Curie temperature and a high remanence of the mag￾netization fostered by a high magnetic anisotropy.
The saturation magnetization Ms and the Curie temperature TC of most permanent
magnets are mainly determined by the magnetically active outer transition metal atoms.
Such are especially late ones like iron or cobalt. Their magnetization derives from the
spin S of the individual atoms. The interactions between these individual magnetic cen￾ters are strong enough to yield quite high ordering temperatures TC allowing for em￾ploying such materials at high temperatures. Iron and cobalt order ferromagnetically
at 1044 and 1388 K with saturation magnetizations of 2.2 and 1.7 μB
, respectively.196 � 9 Magnetism
The third precondition, the high magnetic or magnetocrystalline anisotropy is
mainly provided by the rare-earth sublattice. Due to their relativistic spin-orbit cou￾pling, the anisotropy is clearly higher for heavy elements such as rare-earth elements.
Simply spoken, the anisotropic electrostatic crystal field modifies the orbital motion of
the electrons. Via the relativistic spin-orbit coupling, the electrostatic interaction be￾tween the rare-earth atoms and the local ligand field yields an isotropy energy, which
inhibits easy spin conversion. Accordingly, good permanent magnetic materials fea￾ture uniaxial crystal structures like tetragonal, rhombohedral or hexagonal systems
with a preferential or principal axis along which the magnetization is easier to achieve
compared to other hard directions, i. e., the easy axis. This is the case for all materi￾als described in this chapter. The anisotropy energy Eanis per volume scales with the
anisotropy coefficient K1 via
Eanis = K1
⋅ (sin θ)
2
(9.30)
with the angle θ quantifying the deviation from the easy axis. K1 depends from temper￾ature and the composition of the considered material. According to
Hc = α
2K1
μ0Ms
− βMs
(9.31)
a high coercivity field Hc
results, which is congruent with a higher remanence; here, the
two empirical figures α and β may be determined from the temperature dependence
of the materials parameters [390]. For a competitive hard ferromagnet to be suited as
permanent magnet, the dimensionless magnetic hardness parameter
κ = √
K1
μ0M2
s
(9.32)
should exceed one. This empirical rule of thumb gives the estimation that a ferromag￾netic material withstands self-demagnetization in any possible shape. Finally, the max￾imum energy product BHmax within the hysteresis loop (Figure 9.5) is proportional to
the storable magnetostatic energy by the magnet per volume. It depends strongly from
the shape and the synthesis of a specific magnetic material. An overview of the respec￾tive data for relevant materials is given in Table 9.7. Magnetite, i. e., Fe3O4
, was the first
permanent magnet in mankind and was described already around 600 BC by Thales of
Miletus. It is therefore added for comparison purposes to this table. For further compari￾son, SrFe12O19, one of the most competitive materials not containing rare-earth elements
is given.
Looking at the data in Table 9.7, the synergy of 3d outer and 4f inner transition met￾als is apparent. Thus, it is not really surprising that these mixed magnets dominate the
market. Regarding the choice of rare-earth elements both samarium and neodymium9.6 Rare-Earth Ferromagnets—Often Really Hard and Permanent � 197

have an odd number of 4f electrons, which guarantees a magnetic ground state. Fur￾ther, both contribute a high spin and a high orbit contribution to the magnetic moment.
There are two main strategies to develop high-performance permanent magnets.
On one hand, the structure and the exact composition of the material determines the
saturation magnetization, the Curie temperature as well as the magnetic anisotropy. On
the other hand, extrinsic properties such as coercivity Hc and the energy product BHmax
may be tuned by nanostructuring or the design of the grain boundaries [386, 387]. For
all of the following examples, the early rare-earth elements couple ferromagnetically
with iron and cobalt, respectively, and the late rare-earth elements couple antiferro￾magnetically. These are accordingly ferrimagnets and show only low saturation mag￾netizations [391]. Generally, you might wonder how the interaction between outer and
inner transition metal sublattices can be understood as the 4f states are well localized.
In the case of iron or cobalt, the outer transition metals form 3d and 4s bands where a
direct interaction via itinerant electrons occurs, where magnetization occurs according
the mechanism discussed in Chapter 9.3.2. There we also saw that 4f electrons interact
with others via spin-polarized bands. They employ itinerant electrons as mediator, and
here both 3d and 4f elements meet. Thus, the outer transition metals are responsible
for the magnetization as such, influence the Curie temperature while the inner transi￾tion metals enhance indirectly this magnetization and especially stabilize the magnetic
ordering and the coercivity via their anisotropy [392].
9.6.1 SmCo5
Samarium-cobalt alloys were the first highly competitive rare-earth permanent mag￾nets, and they are still important today. Their story started in 1967 with SmCo5
pub￾lished by Strnat.
94 Samarium-cobalt SmCo5
showed a really convincing magnetocrys￾talline anisotropy yielding an excellent K1
coefficient combined with a high Curie tem￾94 Karl Josef Strnat, Austrian physicist (*1929 †1992).198 � 9 Magnetism
perature and a good saturation magnetization [393]. It is thermodynamically very stable
and can thus be employed up to higher temperatures. Accordingly, it can be synthesized
first as ingots starting from melts of the elements. These ingots are subsequently grinded
and magnetically saturated by applying a magnetic field. A side-effect of the grinding is
the introduction of grain boundaries enhancing the coercivity of the particles. For the
production of magnets, the material is then compressed and sintered, again under in￾fluence of a magnetic field.
Besides the main representative, also the other isostructural rare-earth compounds
were investigated. The RCo5
feature Curie temperatures ranging between 650 and
1050 K. As mentioned before, the early rare-earth elements couple ferromagnetically
with the transition metal sublattice while the late rare-earth elements yield a ferri￾magnetic ordering. The magnetization of the ferromagnets declines with increasing
temperature. Interestingly, the magnetization of the ferrimagnets increases with rising
temperature, which makes the late rare-earth elements interesting as admixture to
increase the magnetization of the ferromagnets at elevated temperatures. The highest
anisotropy among all RCo5
shows the samarium compound, which is therefore the most
relevant.
According to Figure 9.8, the coordination of the samarium atoms is quite anisotropic
here. Along the principal axis, direct interactions of the rare-earth atoms are feasible
while perpendicular to the principal axis only cobalt atoms coordinate. So, most of the
employed RCo5
contain as main rare-earth component samarium, but with admixtures
of further late rare-earth elements.
With the goal to reduce the material’s price and to enhance the coercivity, many at￾tempts were made to substitute cobalt at least partially by iron. This proved challenging
due to the low solubility of iron in the RCo5
. In the end, this work succeeded by the dis￾covery that doping with copper fosters the solubility for iron in SmCo5
; in the course of

this development, finally another important cobalt based magnet, namely Sm2
Co17, was
found, which will be described in the following section [391, 395].
9.6.2 Sm2
Co17
Because of the high Curie temperatures, the magnets based on Sm2
Co17 and SmCo5
are
the best for high-temperature applications. For example, the aforementioned applica￾tion in aerospace thrusters requires a stability up to at least 500 °C. The first syntheses
and the crystal structure for Sm2
Co17 were reported in 1966 [396, 397]. Also here, the
samarium atoms are anisotropically coordinated as shown in Figure 9.8—just omit the
green nitrogen atoms in Sm2
Co17N3
. Contrarily to SmCo5
the coordination is more hemi￾spherical, though. Hence, it is not surprising that the anisotropy coefficient K1
is smaller
here.
Most important for the application as a permanent magnet is that the easy magne￾tization axis coincides with the principal axis. This is not the case for many rare-earth
compounds R2
Co17—only for Sm2
Co17, Er2
Co17 and Tm2
Co17. The adjacent atoms along
the principal axis predominantly deliver negative, those perpendicular positive contri￾butions to K1
; it depends from the actual combination of R and transition metal, which
contribution dominates in the end. Moreover, only the light rare-earth elements like
samarium yield ferromagnetic ordering, while in the case of the heavier like erbium
and thulium ferrimagnetism occurs. Hence, Sm2
Co17 is the material of choice here. The
other R2
Co17 feature Curie temperatures ranging between 1070 and 1220 K while the re￾spective iron compounds show too low ordering temperatures below 500 K for a practi￾cal application. By introduction of nitrogen to form Sm2
Fe17N3
, the Curie temperatures
of the iron compound became interesting, though [391].
9.6.3 Sm2
Fe17N3
In 1990, Coey et al.95 reported that the compounds R2
Fe17 absorbed nitrogen upon treat￾ment with gaseous ammonia or nitrogen [398, 399]. The amount of nitrogen may vary
between zero and six atoms per formula unit. It provides really superior magnetic prop￾erties such as a higher anisotropy parameter and an energy product BHmax of up to
375 kJm– 3. But unfortunately its limited thermal stability prevents a broader applica￾tion as it cannot be sintered appropriately into large magnets. Skomski96 cooperated

boride and nitride magnets by combining nanoscaled hard and soft magnetic materials
to achieve up to 1 MJm– 3 [400].
In Chapter 6.4.2, the crystal structures of Sm2
Co17 and Sm2
Fe17N3
are described. It is
evident that variable nitrogen contents can be achieved because the incorporation of ni￾trogen as nitride occurs on interstitial sites in Sm2
Co17, the structure is maintained. The
electronegative nitrogen atoms add to the coordination of the samarium atoms solely in
the a-b plane. As this is perpendicular to the principal axis as depicted in Figure 9.8, this
apparently enhances K1
significantly. Moreover, the lattice expands especially in the a-b
plane by a few percent upon uptake of nitrogen. This causes larger interatomic distances
and, accordingly, a higher saturation magnetization, which is known as magnetovolume
effect.
9.6.4 Nd2
Fe14B
We learned from the previous example that incorporation of a nonmetal rises the Curie
temperature. Thus, also the iron compound became competitive. Apparently, the non￾metal mediates a stronger interaction, a stronger superexchange between neighboring
transition metal atoms. Then magnetic ordering becomes more stable, and the Curie
temperature rises.
In a similar approach as before starting from a composition R2
Fe17, we end up here
with Nd2
Fe14B after the introduction of boron. Nd2
Fe14B was discovered in the 1980s
and shows the highest magnetization of all rare-earth compounds R2
Fe14B. The mag￾netization of the neodymium compound amounts to almost the threefold value of the
dysprosium, approximately the double value of the holmium compound, which is due to
the ferrimagnetic behavior there. Nd2
Fe14B outperforms also the previously described
magnets regarding magnetization; see Table 9.7. On the other hand, the dysprosium and
holmium compounds feature the highest anisotropy energies, i. e., a higher anisotropy
parameter, suggesting a higher remanence. Since dysprosium is the more abundant ele￾ment out of the latter two, this was chosen for high-remanence ferromagnets based on
the neodymium compound [401]. The addition of dysprosium or terbium ensures a bet￾ter thermal stability of the permanent magnetism allowing for operating temperatures
of up to 480 K, i. e., roughly 200 °C. Because of the clearly higher price of the heavier rare￾earth elements, there is a motivation to reduce the amount of dysprosium as much as
possible. Hereby, it was advantageous that the maximum effect for the high application
temperature can already be achieved by concentrating the dysprosium admixtures on
the surface of the particles.
Compared with the previous rare-earth magnets the boride magnets feature con￾siderable lower Curie temperatures between 400 and 700 K. The Curie temperature of
Nd2
Fe14B lies at 585 K, luckily a sufficient value. In solid solutions with cobalt an even
higher TC of up to 800 K was found. But with increasing cobalt content the coercivity
declined and the price of the transition metal rises.9.7 Magnetocaloric Materials � 201
The crystal structure was described in Chapter 6.4 and depicted in Figure 6.19. Im￾portant is the highly anisotropic surrounding of the rare-earth atoms as displayed in Fig￾ure 9.8. In contrast to the other examples, here the direct contacts to adjacent rare-earth
atoms occur within the a-b plane as do the interaction to boron. But nevertheless, also
the coordination of the neodymium atoms is highly anisotropic. The ternary compound
Nd2
Fe14B is less high-temperature stable than the samarium-cobalt intermetallic phases
described before. So, for high-temperature applications the latter will be preferred de￾spite the better magnetic performance than even dysprosium doped Nd2
Fe14B [203, 391].
At room temperature, applications such as hard-disc drives the neodymium-iron-boron
magnets are the best choice.
9.7 Magnetocaloric Materials
Among the most relevant challenges of environmental and climate change are air￾conditioning and heating of buildings. These were responsible for more than half of the
building energy consumption according to the United Nations annual report 2018—and
the need especially for cooling will rapidly grow further [402]. Efficient electricity driven
refrigeration or heating is therefore a challenge for chemistry and physics. Actually, con￾ventional approaches suffer from the use of refrigerants like CFCs and the emission of
climate-damaging gases.97
Materials showing the magnetocaloric effect might be helpful in achieving more ef￾ficient devices for refrigeration and heat pumps, potentially saving up to 30 % of the
energy [403, 404]. Among such materials are many that contain rare-earth elements.
Here, a ferromagnet is employed close to its ordering temperature, the Curie tempera￾ture TC
. The ferromagnet is magnetized and upon relaxation after turning off the exter￾nal field heat is consumed, magnetic cooling or magnetic refrigeration occurs [389]. More
precisely, upon adiabatic magnetization the magnetic moments of a paramagnetic sub￾stance are aligned along the magnetic field. This provides heat to the system. After turn￾ing off the magnetic field, the individual magnetic moments relax, and the magnetiza￾tion declines. This adiabatic demagnetization consumes heat. In the case of a ferromag￾net, below the transition temperature, the magnetic moments are permanently aligned.
And above the Curie temperature the bulk magnetization vanishes, usually showing a
more or less pronounced hysteresis. Simply spoken, the magnetization and demagneti￾zation of a ferromagnetic or paramagnetic substance may transport heat if the heated
magnetized and cooled demagnetized substances are contacted with outdoor and in￾door reservoirs, respectively. Besides the environmentally-benign applications also liq￾97 Environmentally hazardous chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), such as CH2
ClF, contribute to the depletion
of atmospheric ozone and exhibit strong absorption in the atmospheric window, intensifying the green￾house effect.202 � 9 Magnetism
uefaction of gases or cooling toward extremely low temperatures are applications of
such magnetocaloric materials.

Thermodynamically spoken, the magnetization of a substance reduces its magnetic
entropy, SM. The demagnetization increases the magnetic entropy. This is displayed in
Figure 9.9. Under a magnetic field H1
, the substance has the entropy S1
, and under the
smaller, normally zero magnetic field H0
the entropy S0
. Moreover, the entropy increases
with increasing temperature. Hence, changing the magnetic field from H0
to H1
causes
an entropy change and a temperature change. According to the second law of thermo￾dynamics, entropy and temperature are related via the heat capacity cp
,
dSp,H =
cp,H

with respect to a magnetic field H. A further derivation leads to an expression for the

with zero field H0
, the magnetic field H1 and the magnetization M as well as the per￾meability of vacuum μ0
. Hence, the magnetocaloric effect is then large, when the heat
capacity strongly depends on the magnetic field. And this is the case close to the or￾dering temperature for ferromagnets or with decreasing temperature for paramagnetic
substances [407]. Further, ΔSM grows with large magnetic moments of the atoms within
a substance. Therefore, elements like gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, er￾bium, thulium, europium or samarium are interesting here according to Table 9.2. Ac￾cording to Table 9.8, in gadolinium metal a change of the magnetic field by two tesla
yields an adiabatic temperature change of 4.7 K around its ferromagnetic Curie temper￾ature of 293 K [408].9.7 Magnetocaloric Materials � 203

If accompanied by a first-order phase transition, also the latent heat of the phase
transition contributes yielding a giant magnetocaloric effect, thus highly interesting for
applications. Moreover, the entropy change may be enhanced by different lattice and
electronic entropies of the phases. The latter scales with the density of states around the
Fermi level; this is large near a quarter or three quarters filled f or d bands. A magne￾tocaloric effect is named “giant” if it exceeds that of metallic gadolinium [408].
9.7.1 Gd5
(Si2
Ge2
)
The first prominent example featuring a giant magnetocaloric effect, containing a rare￾earth element was the intermetallic compound Gd5
(Si2Ge2
) [412]. Pure Gd5
Si4
shows
ferromagnetic ordering at 335 K, while Gd5Ge4
orders antiferromagnetically at a much
lower temperature. Halfway through the solid solution a distinct phase Gd5
(Si2Ge2
) was
identified. It orders ferromagnetically at a lower temperature than the pure silicon com￾pound, close to room temperature, which is advantageous for an application in build￾ings. Paramagnetic Gd5
(Si2Ge2
) is a monoclinically distorted variant of the orthorhombic
structure of Gd5
Si4
depicted in Figure 9.9. In the Gd5
Si4
structure, a gadolinium lattice
consisting of two close packed layers, A and B, and a further layer C with half rare-earth
atom density hosts Si2
dumbbells.
In Gd5
(Si2Ge2
) a coupled first-order magnetostructural phase transition occurs. To
classify a phase transition as a first-order transition, the exchange of latent heat is com￾pulsory. Therefore, their value is also given in Table 9.8. Upon cooling below the Curie
temperature, Gd5
(Si2Ge2
) becomes ferromagnetic, and simultaneously its structure con￾verts into the orthorhombic Gd5
Si4
structure. Magnetically, the ferromagnetic ordering
reduces the magnetic entropy of Gd5
(Si2Ge2
). Structurally, a relative shift of the rare￾earth and the main group element atoms M occurs between the layers A’ and B yield￾ing a volume increase of approximately 1 %. More importantly, as shown in Figure 9.9
selected M–M bonds form during the phase transition by reducing the Si/Ge–Si/Ge dis￾tances from 348 to 273 pm. This apparently decreases the lattice entropy of Gd5
(Si2Ge2
)
upon cooling. Thus, both transitions lead to a reduced entropy. A further contribution
of a changed electronic entropy was considered to be small [403, 413].204 � 9 Magnetism
9.7.2 Eu2
In
Contrarily to Gd5
(Si2Ge2
), for the magnetocaloric material Eu2
In a coupled first-order
magnetoelastic phase transition was found. In such a phase transition, the symmetry of
the structure does not change. Instead, the phase transition is mainly driven by a recon￾struction of the electronic structure around the Fermi level, which then also causes huge
differences in the magnetic behavior. Eventually, the same changes of magnetic entropy
add up with the overall entropy change to yield a giant magnetocaloric effect. Normally,
for such magnetic effects driven by changes of the electronic structure, transition met￾als like in TmZn or rare-earth doped manganites R1-xMx
[MnO3
] (R = La, Nd, Pr; M = Ca,
Sr, Ba) are needed [411, 414, 415]. These provide the itinerant electrons, which convey
the interaction of the strong magnetic moments of 4f elements according to the RKKY
mechanism. In Eu2
In, this role has to be adopted by the main-group element indium.
The structure of the intermetallic phase Eu2
In can be understood by flat close
packed layers with ordered distribution of europium and indium as shown in Fig￾ure 9.9. These layers are packed in an alternating fashion with the two europium atoms
on both layers are crystallographic distinct; the layers feature very similar interatomic
distances. The distances between the metal atoms do not show clearly anisotropic be￾havior, so it is indeed a three-dimensional structure. The underlying structure type is
that of Co2
Si.
Upon cooling below the Curie temperature of 55 K, a phase transition occurs where
the unit cell volume shrinks discontinously by only 0.1 %, in line with an extraordinar￾ily small hysteresis of the phase transition. This tiny change does not imply any valence
change of the divalent europium atoms as Eu3+ would be significantly smaller. As it is
a magnetoelastic transition, the structure remains the same. The determined magnetic
moments of 8.5 μB
indicate the presence of divalent europium, isoelectronic with Gd3+
.
The magnetization at very low temperatures of 5 K of nmax = 14.4 μB
suggests a collinear
arrangement of the magnetic moments of both crystallographically different europium
atoms. For comparison with the basic values for Eu2+, consult Table 9.2. The slightly
higher values than typical for divalent europium were ascribed to minor contributions
from populated 5d states strongly hybridized with indium’s 5p states. This intense in￾teraction is believed to be responsible for the apparently electronically driven unique
behavior of Eu2
In as a magnetocaloric material [410].Epilogue

liaison with further elements. Alike the world, also the periodic table is colorful and

on the filling of octahedral and tetrahedral voids (OVs and TVs), respectively. Orange￾filled boxes represent filled voids while blank ones show unoccupied voids. Packing
atoms and layers are colored cyan. You may recognize that the same or at least very
similar filling schemes of tetrahedral, octahedral or related voids occur in both close

derived from cubic close packings are listed in the left column, structures derived from
hexagonal close packings in the right column. It does of course not replace a concise

Based on Table E.1, the symmetry races of contributing levels are employed to determine

so it is sufficient that the product of the electronic states’ races yield the respective race
of rotation (magnetic dipole) or translation (electric dipole). In our example, the total
symmetric representation is a

. This representation ensures that the product of the orig￾inally contributing wavefunctions, for which the symmetry races represent the symmet￾ric behavior, yields a positive integral according to Equations (7.9) and (7.11).
Let the wavefunctions ψ1

(e. g.,
a dz
2 orbital), e
′
(e. g., a px

2
(e. g., a pz

ψ2 behaves symmetrically like the product of their symmetry races a

1 ⊗ e
′
. By multiply￾ing the respective characters in Table E.1, this yields symmetry race e
′
. Since the two
translations Tx and Ty
transform like e
′
, this transition is allowed as an electric dipole.
As a second example, we consider the transition between ψ2 and ψ3
. Here, the product
yields e
′′ according to the symmetry behavior of the rotations Rx and Ry
. Hence, this
transition is allowed as a magnetic dipole transition while it is forbidden as an electric
dipole transition.
