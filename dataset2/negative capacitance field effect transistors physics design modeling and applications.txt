Preface
Almost on a regular basis, the semiconductor industry has gone through techno￾logical innovation, thereby accomplishing significant developmental milestones. The 
development of metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) and the 
advent of the three-dimensional (3D) MOSFET structure have led to the recent state￾of-the-art semiconductor production. However, simple structural development has 
been faced with unavoidable limitations, especially since the size of transistors cannot 
be easily reduced and the structural development has been almost saturated after the 
advent of gate-all-around (GAA) MOSFET structure. Fortunately, the modern semi￾conductor industry has successfully overcome this limitation by material innovation, 
namely, negative capacitance (NC) technology. With the help of the wonderful com￾bination of nanomaterials, it is entirely possible to boost the transistor’s performance 
and circuit performance at the same time. Moreover, the application of NC tech￾nology could boost the performance of the transistor, without reducing its size.
This book, Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors: Physics, Design, 
Modeling and Applications, presents a self-contained and cutting-edge technology 
and sine qua non of ideas and illustrations that will help readers to easily learn about 
nanomaterials and their applications. This book can also serve as a reference for 
material engineers and electronic engineers and experts in the semiconductor industry.
The book also carefully considers the basic concepts and physics which are critical 
to understanding the basic operation principles of modern semiconductors. With the 
recently advanced quantum mechanics, the overall flow of semiconductor design and 
development can be easily and intuitively understood. The editors sincerely hope that 
these up-to-date theories and technological descriptions will enable readers to gain a 
thorough understanding of modern semiconductors. This book also considers the cir￾cuit perspective, so that a more hands-on understanding can be gained.
We, the editors, would like to express our sincere gratitude for all the assistance 
provided by various research teams and authors in writing and discussing the content 
of this book and their invaluable data inputs. Also, we are grateful for the time and 
efforts that all our colleagues and co-workers have invested in the development and 
design of this book.

1.1 INTRODUCTION
We are now living in an unprecedented society, where fifth-generation (5G) tech￾nology enables people to communicate with each other at any time, no matter where 
they are [1]. In addition, the emerging big data market has also enabled emerging 
industries (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok), thereby creating numerous 
new jobs [2]. In this regard, the importance of recent semiconductor technology 
will be crucial, especially since most emerging industries are closely related with 
semiconductors. Without the recent advances in the semiconductor industry, the 
above-mentioned industries might not have been able to be created.
According to recent surveys, the size of semiconductor industries has been steadily 
increased, roughly 20–30% per year [3]. In addition, according to the International 
12 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS) organization, this trend will continue until 
2030, with the help of the consistent development of transistors [4]. Therefore, what 
does the term ‘semiconductor’ specifically mean? To find the answer, we first need to 
briefly look into the structure of a computer.
1.2 BASIC ARCHITECTURE OF A COMPUTER
Figure 1.1 shows the image of computer users. Normally, people use a mouse and 
keyboard while using a computer. If users push any buttons on the keyboard or any 
buttons of the mouse, then the result will be shown on the monitor. Sometimes, the 
speaker will be turned on so that some music or soundtracks can be played through 
a speaker.
In this example, we can easily understand the basic structure of a computer. In this 
example, ‘keyboard’ and ‘mouse’ are examples of input devices, and ‘monitor’ and 
‘speaker’ are examples of output devices.
This explanation is illustrated in Figure 1.2. Input devices and output devices 
are somewhat familiar concepts and easy for us to understand. We can see the input 
devices and output devices whenever we use a computer. Then, what is a ‘central 
processing unit (CPU)’ as shown in Figure 1.2? When a computer user uses a com￾puter, the CPU will undergo some operations. For example, when the user clicks the 
‘Internet button’, then the CPU will carry out some operations so that the Internet 
page can be directly viewed on the monitor. When the computer user clicks the ‘My 
favorite music.mp3’ button twice, then the CPU will find that file and play the file 
right away, so that the output device (speaker) can play the music file.
Let’s carefully look at Figure 1.2 again. The CPU consists of a control unit, arith￾metic logic unit (ALU), and cache memory. Here, the term ‘ALU’ means the device 
which carrier out the basic operation of calculation. For example, ALU does an add￾ition operation (e.g., ‘binary adder’: 101 + 010 = 111) and deduction operation.
ALU also does logic operations. As shown in Figure 1.3, there are four main logic 
operations in computer: NOT, AND, OR, and XOR. First, the NOT operator simply 
reverses the binary value; from ‘0’ to ‘1’, and from ‘1’ to ‘0’. Second, the AND oper￾ator makes an output ‘1’ only if two inputs are both ‘1’ (Figure 1.3). If one of the 
two inputs is ‘0’ or both of the inputs are ‘0’, the output will be ‘0’. The OR operator 
has another function. The OR operator gives ‘1’ output, if there is any ‘1’ among the 
inputs. For example, when input ‘1’ and ‘0’ flow into the OR operator, the output will 
be ‘1’. On the other hand, when only input ‘0’ and ‘0’ flow into the OR operator, the 
output will be ‘0’.
So far, we have learned the basic concepts with theoretical approaches. Now, let’s 
move on to a ‘hands-on’ explanation. Figure 1.4 illustrates the basic structure of 
computers. Most readers will be familiar with this figure. If you are not familiar with 
this image, don’t worry. When you remove the outer cover of your computer, you can 
easily identify a similar structure to that in Figure 1.4.
In Figure 1.4, there are a CPU (circle), main memory (rectangle), and memory slot 
(diamond). The memory slot (diamond) is the place where the main memory device 
needs to be put in. When the main memory device is successfully put into the memory 
slot (rectangle), then the computer will be able to save information.Recent Challenges in IT and Semiconductor Industry 3
1.3 PRACTICE: HOW TO CHECK WHAT KIND OF CPU YOUR 
COMPUTER HAS
Most readers will have access to computers, if not you can go to the local library to 
use the computer. You can easily find what kind of CPU (the circle in Figure 1.4) and 
memory device (rectangular in Figure 1.4) the computer has without removing the 
cover of the computer. Please follow the following steps (the following description 
and figures are made by Windows [Windows 11], not IOS).
First, type ‘settings’ (Figure 1.5), and then press ‘enter’. Then, you should 
see Figure 1.6. Scroll down, and you can find the ‘About’ button (Figure 1.6). 
FIGURE 1.2 Basic computer architecture.
FIGURE 1.1 A person using a computer.4 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
Click the ‘About’ button. Then, you should find a page somewhat similar to that 
in Figure 1.7.
By analyzing the page similar to Figure 1.7, you can easily discover what kind 
of CPU and memory device the computer has. As emphasized by the rectangle in 
Figure 1.7, this computer has a CPU (processor) made by Intel, i7-10800F, with 2.90 
GHz. In addition, this computer has 32.0 GB main memory (RAM).
For clarity, note that regarding the memory of a computer, the computer has two 
kinds of memory: The main memory (e.g., RAM) and auxiliary memory (e.g., hard 
disk, CD, DVD, SSD). The illustrated computer has 32 GB main memory (RAM) and 
512 GB auxiliary memory (SSD). It can save music files, game files, and document 
files up to 512 GB. The main memory (RAM) acts as a bridge between the auxil￾iary memory (hard disk, CD, DVD, SSD) and the CPU. A more detailed explanation 
on the differences between main memory and auxiliary memory can be found in 
References [5–8].
1.4 VON NEUMAN ARCHITECTURE
So far, we have learned that a computer is composed of an input unit, CPU, memory 
unit, and output unit. This concept in dealing with computer architecture is called 
‘Von Neuman architecture’ [9]. The input unit includes the keyboard, mouse, and 
scanner, while the output unit includes the monitor, printer, and speaker. Importantly, 
as shown in Figure 1.8, the CPU has the function of arithmetic operation (addition, 
deduction) and logic operation (NOT, OR, AND). The memory devices help the com￾puter to save information.
In this book, the most recent state-of-the-art technology is explained in detail, 
especially for CPU and memory. In both CPU and memory, a negative capacitance 
field effect transistor (NCFET) plays a key role in designing high-performance CPU 
and memory. To understand the concept of NCFET, we need to learn the concept of 
the circuit and transistors. A recently developed computer has more than 0.1 billion 
circuits, and one circuit has about 2–20 transistors. Therefore, this computer could 
have more than 1 billion transistors.
For a bottom-up approach, in this book, ‘transistor’ is explained first, and then 
‘circuit’ is explained later. Figure 1.9 briefly shows the basic structure of modern 
FIGURE 1.3 Four basic components of logic operation.Recent Challenges in IT and Semiconductor Industry 5
transistors, which is usually a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor 
(MOSFET). In this MOSFET, an electric voltage can be applied to the source, gate, 
and drain region (Figure 1.9) through the metal line. Normally, the source has 0 V, 
and the drain has 0.6 V.
However, the gate voltage varies, depending on the situation. When you want to 
turn this transistor (MOSFET) on, then you can apply a gate voltage of 0.6 V. Then, 
electric current will flow in the MOSFET. On the contrary, if you want to turn the 
FIGURE 1.5 First step for hands-on practice: checking the CPU type of a computer.
FIGURE 1.4 The mainboard of a computer.6 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
transistor (MOSFET) off, then you might apply a gate voltage of 0 V. Then, electric 
current will not flow through the transistor (MOSFET).
Specifically, when the transistor is on (gate voltage = drain voltage = 0.6 V and 
source voltage = 0 V), lots of electrons move from the source (0 V) to the drain (0.6 V).
Then, the current will flow from the drain to the source (the direction of current is 
the opposite of the direction of electron movement).
Figure 1.10 briefly shows how the structure of MOSFET has evolved [10–16]. 
When MOSFET was first developed in 1960, the structure of planar MOSFET 
(Figure 1.10) was used. This planar MOSFET (Figure 1.10) structure is the same 
structure as in Figure 1.9. TAs time has passed, the structure of this planar MOSFET 
evolved into the double gate MOSFET (DG-MOSFET), FinFET, and GAA MOSFET 
(= nanosheet [NS] MOSFET), step by step. Specifically, the advanced structure has 
better controllability. That is to say, when the transistor is off, the advanced struc￾ture consumes low power. Therefore, a modern computer made using an advanced 
structure consumes low power, thereby saving battery power. To sum up, the future 
of transistors requires: (1) high performance (high on-state current), (2) low power 
consumption (low off-state current), and (3) fast switching speed (low delay). By 
incorporating the NCFET technique, these three aims for future transistors could be 
simultaneously achieved [17–20].
FIGURE 1.6 Second step for hands-on practice: checking the CPU type of a computer.Recent Challenges in IT and Semiconductor Industry 7
The title of this book (Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors [NCFETs]) 
describes the state of art technology which has been applied to all these structures. 
By applying this NCFET technology to the transistor, the performance of the tran￾sistor can be significantly boosted, and the power consumption of the CPU (during 
the off-state, when the computer or portable electronic device is switched off) could 
FIGURE 1.8 Von Neumann architecture with a CPU.
FIGURE 1.7 Third step for hands-on practice: checking the CPU type of a computer.8 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
be decreased at the same time. In the next chapter, the basic operation principle of 
NCFET is described step by step.
1.5 CONCLUSION
So far, we have learned about the basic structure of modern computers, namely Von 
Neumann architecture. Most computers consist of an input unit, central processing 
FIGURE 1.10 Structural evolution of MOSFET from planar MOSFET (initial structure) to 
GAA MOSFET (recent advanced structure).
FIGURE 1.9 The basic structure of MOSFET with three contacts (source, gate, drain).Recent Challenges in IT and Semiconductor Industry 9
unit (CPU), memory unit, and output unit. Among these, the CPU plays a key role 
in the computer, especially with logic operations (NOT, OR, AND) and basic arith￾metic operations (addition, deduction). The CPU can consist of more than 0.1 billion 
circuits, and one circuit normally consists of about 2–20 transistors. Therefore, one 
CPU can have more than 1 billion transistors, and so the basic design of transistors is 
paramount. In this regard, by incorporating NCFET technology (which is described 
later in this book), the three main goals of future transistor design—high perform￾ance, low power, high switching speed—could be simultaneously achieved.

2.1 INTRODUCTION
Energy saving is a most promising sector of research and development. Nowadays, 
energy saving or low power is becoming a critical challenge that is most important for 
the future of humanity. Semiconductor science and technology play a continuous lead 
role in energy sectors. The development of the first semiconductor device named BJT 
is the first example. This device has almost totally replaced vacuum tube technology. 
Exiting leakage currents in BJT have become its main negative factor. Research and 
development have resolved a solution for BJT technology in terms of field effect 
technology. MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) is one of 
the most popular candidates in field effect technology. This semiconductor device 
has played the lead role in the development of low-power circuits and systems. It has 
completely changed the thinking and lifestyles of humans. Laptops, smart phones, 
and smartwatches are some of its common uses, and the most popular development is 
based on MOSFET technology. The bulk of MOSFET-based devices have followed 
the rules and regulations timely published by ITRS and other agencies such as IDEM 
and Moore’s law. The demand for low power is continuously increasing, and power 
supply scaling has been the main guiding rule for MOSFETs.
This chapter is an overview presenting the technical demand for low-power 
applications. The following section focuses on details about the technical requirements 
of low-power research and development. In this chapter, we briefly mention some 
of the most relevant and emerging semiconductor field effect devices and their 
applications for low-power very large-scale integration (VLSI).
212 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
2.2 TECHNICAL DEMAND INVESTIGATION FOR 
 LOW-POWER USES
In electrical engineering, the power dissipation of an electronic circuit and system 
during a particular time interval of a circuit element can be measured by relation 
(2.1), written as
E = ∫ P t( ) dt (2.1)
In Equation (2.1), E is energy and P is power. The power dissipation of an integrated 
circuit and system can be represented by Equation (2.2)
P P P P switch sc off = + + (2.2)
Equation (2.2) shows that the power dissipation roughly contains three components, 
Pswitch is the switching power, Psc is the power corresponding to the simultaneous and 
short-time on state of the two MOSFETs, due to their non-ideal behavior, and Poff is 
the static power dissipation. In a VLSI circuit and system, design engineers reduce 
the switching power Pswitch at a high level using ultra-scaled MOSFET structures. 
This is possible due to continuous scaling of conventional MOSFET, as estimated by 
Equation (2.3), where α is the switching activity, f the frequency, C the capacitance, 
and VDD the voltage applied
P fCV switch DD = α 2 (2.3)
The scaling of the MOSFET reduces the switching power but increases the off-state 
leakage power dissipation. This power is directly connected to the leakage current of 
MOSFET denoted as I
OFF, calculated by the following well-known equation.
E CV switch DD = 2 (2.4)
In CMOS, both the energy (E) and the power (P) dissipated are related to the 
square of the applied voltage, VDD.
2.3 CHALLENGES OF CONVENTIONAL CMOS TECHNOLOGY
One of the most important key parameters is the subthreshold-swing (SS), which 
represents the basic performance of transistors. For example, a transistor that has 
lower SS will have a low off-current and high on-current, thereby realizing both low 
power consumption and high performance, at the same time. However, there has been 
a fundamental limitation regarding SS. That is to say, conventionally, SS has been dif￾ficult to have lower than 60 mV/dec, because of the physical mechanism of electrical 
current in the transistor (namely, thermionic emission).
The low-power R&D block point in term of technology is known as ‘Boltzmann’s 
tyranny.’ For MOSFET-based technology, this key term is formulated asTechnical Demands of Low-Power Electronics 13

In the developed low-power series , the semiconductor has overshot the limitations 
of conventional MOSFET. The solution of subthreshold slope limitations has been 
identified in terms of steep subthreshold FETs such as tunnel FETs and NCFETs. 
These devices have a lower steep subthreshold than 60 mV/decade.
Figure 2.1 shows a schematic of the conventional MOSFET and the effect of 
scaling on the device dimensions. It has three metal contacts: source, gate, and drain. 
The electric voltage can be applied to these three contacts. By applying a high voltage 
to the gate, the transistor can be turned on. On the other hand, by applying 0 V to the 
gate, the transistor can be turned off.
Figure 2.2 shows that continuous power scaling is impossible because leakage 
power has become the dominant consumer of power for the smaller 90 nm technology 
node. To overshoot power scaling limitation, device researchers have suggested and 
developed several types of field effect devices, namely tunnel FETs and negative 
capacitance FETs, which are the most effective developments. TFET technology 
replaces classical transport in the case of conventional MOSFET with quantum￾mechanical band-to-band (BtB). BtB tunneling results in considerable and remarkable 
enhancements in subthreshold slope (SS) and power consumption characteristics, far 
beyond those of the standard CMOS technology. With the CMOS process compati￾bility feature, tunnel FETs have been proven to be prominent structures to meet the 
requirements of low-power nano-devices because of their lower inverse sub-threshold 
slope (SS) and low OFF current (Figure 2.3) [14–16].
In parallel with the development of tunnel FET technology, semiconductor players 
adopted the negative capacitance feature found in ferroelectric materials identified by 
FIGURE 2.1 Scaling of MOSFET. Here S > 1 is the scaling factor.14 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
Suprio Dutta’s group. Negative capacitance-based technology has no transport phe￾nomena issues like tunnel FETs. Both tunnel FET and NC FET devices have steep 
subthresholds and operate at a supply voltage lower than 0.7 V. The low supply oper￾ating feature clearly illustrates that both of these FET candidates are strong semicon￾ductor players for low-power circuits and systems design.
Figure 2.4 shows the supply voltage and EOT scaling in the MOSFET technolo￾gies [17]. The EOT limit defined by the SiO2
 layer between the Si channel and HfO2
material is indicated by the black dashed line. The minimum supply voltage caused 
by the Boltzmann limit is illustrated by the red dashed lines in Figure 2.4.
The CMOS devices have accomplished remarkable progress with higher speed 
and lower power for more than 50 years. Table 2.1 shows the device trends in the past 
(based on IEDM) and future (ITRS) of high-performance (HP) devices. The steep

FIGURE 2.2 Power consumption for different technology nodes.Technical Demands of Low-Power Electronics 15
reductions in time delay and energy consumption are achieved by device scaling, 
which remarkably contributes to the innovations of IT technologies.
2.4 QUANTUM DOT CELLULAR AUTOMATA TECHNOLOGY
Quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) is the most promising technology which 
incorporates a shift from transistorized designs to the design of digital circuits using 
quantum dots or metal islands. The vital component of QCA circuits is a QCA cell 
made up of four quantum dots [18]. These quantum dots are 18 × 18 nm in size 
and are located at the cell corners. In the adjacent quantum dots, two free electrons 
reside. These electrons are not able to move among the cells but can tunnel among the 
dots. There are two polarization states of the electrons. They will be either ‘0’ or ‘1’. 
These polarization states are due to the Coulombic repulsion between the cells. The 
information flow from a cell to an empty cell is due to the Coulombic repulsion [19].

Figure 2.5 shows the basic component of QCA circuits which is known as a QCA cell 
and Figure 2.6 shows the polarization states of the cell.
The QCA wire is a chain of QCA cells which helps in the flow of information. 
There are two types of QCA wires: 90º wire and 45º wire, as shown in Figure 2.7.
Another vital component in QCA circuits is a three-input majority voter gate, as 
shown in Figure 2.8. The three-input majority gate can be logically implemented as 
an OR gate and an AND gate by manipulating the inputs. To execute the majority 
voter gate as an OR gate fix one of the three inputs as logic ‘0’ and to implement the 
AND gate fix it as logic ‘1’.
The inverter is another vital component in QCA circuits. The QCA designs of 
inverters existing till date are shown in Figure 2.9.
The clocking in QCA circuits is for the proper flow of information and supplies 
power to reform the signal power dissipation to the setting. There are four clock levels 
in QCA: switch, hold, release, and relax. as shown in Figure 2.10. In the switch phase, 
the inter dot barrier is enhanced and the cell switches its polarity. In the hold phase, 
the cell keeps its polarity attained in the switch phase. The cell loses its polarity 
during the release phase. The cell attains null polarity at the relax phase and electrons 
transfer openly in the cell [18,19]. Moreover, these phases are represented by four 
distinct colors. The switch phase is represented by green, the hold phase by magenta, 
the release phase by blue, and the relax phase by white. The cells in a particular zone 
are managed by the identical clock signal and form a sub-array.
A non-adiabatic clocking scheme can provide a worst-case power estimate in 
QCA cells. Using QCA circuits, we determine the maximum power dissipated. 
QCA cells are analyzed using quantum mechanical calculations to determine their 
power dissipation and polarization. |1> and |0> are the eigenstates of a QCA cell.

The Hamiltonian is the Schrodinger equation that describes a wave function at a 
given point in time. Schrodinger wave equations are used to equate Hamilton’s 
equation, which is a 2 × 2 matrix. In matrix form, Equations (2.3) and (2.4) represent 
Hamiltonian equations.

Here, γ represents the tunneling energy between two polarized states and Ek
 is the 
kink energy. The kink energy is defined as the difference between two horizontally 
adjacent polarized cells whose polarizations are either the same or opposite. Fj,m is the 
geometric factor that varies with j-th and m-th cells in distance and orientation, and Pm
is the polarization of the cell considered. The flow of energy can be calculated from 
the Hamiltonian equations and density matrix. As the clock level rises or barriers are 
raised, energy flows into the cell, and as the clock level drops or barriers are lowered, it 
returns to the clock. The energy must be zero in the steady state. The power flow can be 
calculated by differentiating the energy equation as given in References [20,21]. The

Figure 2.11 shows an example of a D-latch-based memory cell and Figure 2.12
shows the energy dissipation maps at different tunneling levels that are calculated 
using QCAPro tool as in Reference [22]. The darker region shows more energy dissi￾pation and the lighter region shows less dissipation of energy. Therefore, the memory 
cell dissipates less energy at the 0.5 Ek level as compared to the 1.0 and 1.5 Ek levels.Technical Demands of Low-Power Electronics 19
2.5 NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS 
(NC-FETS)
CMOS technology faces fundamental limitations that may be overcome by nega￾tive capacitance field effect transistors (NCFETs). As NCFETs feature a ferroelec￾tric layer within their gates, which amplifies voltage internally, they can operate at 
a lower voltage and still achieve high performance with comparatively little energy 
[23]. Their potential for subthreshold swing (SS) devices below 60 mV/decade has 
FIGURE 2.12 Energy dissipation of memory cell at (a) 0.5 Ek (b) 1.0 Ek, and (c) 1.5 Ek
levels [22].
FIGURE 2.11 (a) Representation of D-latch based memory cell, (b) implementation of 
memory cell in QCA [22].20 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
attracted considerable interest over the past 5 years. In addition to their capability 
to scale to the next technological node, sub-60-mV/decade devices also limit device 
power dissipation, enabling transistor density and performance to be increased. By 
replacing the gate oxide with a ferroelectric dielectric stack, NCFETs improve device 
performance through ‘negative capacitance’ [24].
As reported in References [25–29], a metal-ferroelectric metal–insulator semicon￾ductor (MFMIS) structure is used in short-channel NCFET devices, which require 
a metal layer between the ferroelectric and dielectric layers. The MFMIS structure 
has a higher implementation cost and is less practical because of biasing issues [30]. 
In Reference [31], a device without the metal layer, the metal–ferroelectric insu￾lator semiconductor (MFIS) structure, is reported. It has been shown in References 
[24,32,33] that hysteresis-free NCFETs are possible if a greater ferroelectric capaci￾tance than the field effect transistor (FET) capacitance exists.
Ferroelectric depolarization is responsible for passively boosting the voltage 
across the internal gate of NCFETs. Under identical operating conditions, the surface 
potential of NCFETs is higher than that of conventional MOSFETs [34–39]. Unlike 
TFETs, this device technology adds amplification to the internal voltage but does not 
change the charge transport. This type of device employs non-linearity in the gate 
insulator [42–45]. The NC effect arising from the negative coefficient around the 
metastable state can be stabilized by connecting a paraelectric capacitor in series with 
a ferroelectric [44–51].
A 3D view of an NCFET is shown in Figure 2.13. The equivalent symbolic 
representation of an NCFET is shown in Figure 2.14.
FIGURE 2.14 Symbol of NCFET [42].
FIGURE 2.13 Schematic of NCFET [42].Technical Demands of Low-Power Electronics 21
An NCFET-based 6T SRAM design has been investigated in Reference [43]. It 
has been reported as an excellent choice over CMOS-based 6T SRAM because of 
the high yield estimation at near the threshold voltage. A significant improvement 
has been observed in the design using NCFETs. Table 2.2 presents the perform￾ance of a 6T SRAM based on NCFETs and baseline MOSFETS at VDD equal to 
1 V [43].
Table 2.3 shows the power comparison of NCFET-, MOSFET-, and QCA￾based SRAMs. The QCA-based SRAM dissipates less power as compared to 
the NCFET- and MOSFET-based SRAM cells. The QCA technology has some 
limitations such as the fabrication of QCA devices is still under testing and these 
devices cannot operate above room temperature. Therefore, NCFET is a more 
promising technology.
Table 2.4 shows the temperature sensitivity of a negative capacitance FET. As 
shown in this table, at room temperature (i.e., 300 K), the SS value is close to 60 
mV/decade. This illustrates the theoretical compatibility of negative capacitance with 
ideal limitations of classical CMOS technology. The low off current, lower SS, and 
equivalent on-state current with existing FETs like classical NCFET, NC-tunnel FET, 
NC-FinFET, and NC-GAA could help future development of an ultra-low-power cir￾cuit and system [32–53].
Table 2.5 shows the design facility for optimized NCFETs of negative capaci￾tance FETs. As shown in this table, the appropriate selection of ferroelectric materials 
can help to optimize the device advantages. The internal voltage amplification of 
ferroelectric-based devices and circuit helps to reduce the power consumption and in 
switching energy.

2.6 CONCLUSION
Future nano-electronic circuits and systems face a great challenge in dissipating 
power in switching devices. This chapter reviews ultra-low leakage, ultra-low voltage, 
stepper inverse subthreshold slope, and ultra-low-power devices for the Internet of 
Things. Among the emerging technologies, NCFETs are capable of going beyond 
the fundamental limits of conventional CMOS technology. Despite reducing power 
computation and switching energy, NCFETs maintain performance. It is expected 
that NCFET technology will bypass the limitations of current CMOS technology, 
according to available scientific information on semiconductor device technology and 
that it will contribute greatly to future growth.

3.1 INTRODUCTION
CMOS technology is ubiquitous and plays an important part in our daily lives. 
Mobile technology is one of the best examples of its application. Scaling has been the 
main and most important feature of CMOS devices. This feature of CMOS devices 
has continuously helped in the development of various types of circuits and systems 
for our daily uses, and also in the medical sciences, aerospace, and military areas 
for more than four decades. The scaling of various conventional MOSFET types 
of circuits and systems has been developed to make quality of life improvements 
[1–5]. The scaling of MOSFET technology is within the 5 nm range. As conven￾tional MOSFET devices are scaled for various uses in VLSI circuits and systems, 
the off-state current (Ioff) increases exponentially and is an important aspect for low￾power technology. This increase in the power consumption of CMOS circuits and 
systems [1–20] is illustrated in Figure 3.1. The high off-state current in a conven￾tional MOSFET devices is one of its main limitations. Another limitation of con￾ventional CMOS technology is the minimum 60-mV/decade subthreshold swing as 
measured by SS

2 3 1 , which fundamentally limits 
the reduction of off-state current [5–15] as well as limiting the scaling of the power 
supply (VDD). Here, these variables are used for measurement, and are also useful 
for technical analysis. Thanks to the invention and experimental observation of 
negative capacitance (NC) in ferroelectric material, various structural and material 
developments have been implemented [20–25]. It provides practical device design 
guidelines for low-voltage operation of steep-swing at sub-0.6 V supply voltage. 
In ultra-scaled conventional MOS devices, the subthreshold swing (SS) reaches 
the fundamental thermal limit of 60 mV/decade at room temperature, as shown 
in Figure 3.2. This limitation is an obstacle to achieving high-performance and 
low-power consumption devices. To solve this issue, various new device concepts 
have been identified, such as impact ionization MOS (I-MOS) and tunneling FETs 
(TFETs), which have been suggested due to having a low subthreshold swing. 
328 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
Despite its outstanding features, I-MOS suffers from reliability issues and is not 
suitable for low-power consumption devices because of its high applied voltages 
[1–30]. In the case of TFETs, on-state current (ION) is restricted due to band-to-band 
tunneling probability, even though sub-60-mV/decade switching behavior occurs 
[3,4,7,8], as shown in Figure 3.3
One important measurement of the efficiency of a MOSFET is the subthreshold 
swing (SS), which is the change in gate voltage needed to increase the drain current 
by one order of magnitude. This is measured in units of millivolts per decade in con￾ventional MOSFETs. It is limited to kBT/q by the Boltzmann electron energy distri￾bution. The numeric value in the ideal case for CMOS devices is ~60 mV/decade at 
room temperature (T = 300K). In ultra-scaled devices, this limit has become more 
onerous.
The research chart in Figure 3.2 indicates that there are two optimization domains 
for the limitation of conventional CMOS devices. The first domain is the transport 
factor denoted by the letter ‘n.’ In this research sector, experts examine the transport 
mechanism of the device and identify ideas for developing desirable results. 
Strain technology of CMOS has been used for improving the transport of electrons. 
However, in the case of low power, the tunnel FET is the most popular invention. 
Here, by using band-to-band tunneling, the device advantages are optimized. The 
subthreshold swing and IOFF have been found to be at a desirable level, but ION is 
limited due to band-to-band transport of charge and a limited tunneling window. 
Another domain of optimization of CMOS technology limitations for ultra-low￾power uses is the body factor, denoted by the letter ‘m.’ In this research domain, the 
channel electric field of CMOS devices has been considered for optimization. The 
invention and development of negative capacitance-based devices and technology 
are considered in this domain. Bulk NC FET and NC-FinFET are example within 
this category. Some experts use a hybrid mode of optimization and research for 
ultra-low-power applications. In this category, transport and body factors are taken 
into consideration. The NC-tunnel FET is the best example in this context. Experts 
FIGURE 3.1 Limitations of conventional CMOS technology.Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors 29
are also using more advanced devices including negative NC-GAA and nanosheet 
FETs [15–25].
To overcome the challenges posed by conventional CMOS technology for ultra￾low-power uses, semiconductor experts have invented tunnel FETs with band-to-band 
tunneling of charge carriers. This transport mechanism surpasses the subthreshold 
swing limitation of 60 mV/decade, allowing a lower supply voltage. However, the 
low on-state current limits its universal adoptability for ultra-low-power uses. These 
limitations have resulted in the search for alternatives [3–12]. Identification and 
experimental verification of negative capacitance in ferroelectric materials have been 
the best solution to overcome the limitations of classical MOS devices and fulfill the 
modern requirements of ultra-low-power VLSI applications. In ferroelectric-based 
devices, a ferroelectric capacitor is placed in series with a conventional dielectric gate 
capacitor [20–38]. For example, in a ferroelectric tunnel (FET) an ultra-steep (abrupt) 
switch has a better subthreshold swing (SS) than the MOSFET limit of 60 mV/decade 
at room temperature. This device combines two key principles: ferroelectric gate 
stack and band-to-band tunneling in gated p-i-n junction, in which the ferroelectric 
FIGURE 3.2 Scope for research and development with ultra-low-power electronics.30 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
material included in the gate stack creates, due to dipole polarization with increasing 
gate voltage, a positive feedback in the capacitive coupling that controls the band-to￾band (BTBT) tunneling at the source junction of the silicon p-i-n reversed bias struc￾ture, where the combined effect of band-to-band tunneling and ferroelectric negative 
capacitance offers more abrupt off–on and on–off transitions, as shown in Figure 3.3.
In the remainder of this chapter, the negative capacitance-based developments are 
discussed.
3.2 NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE TECHNOLOGY
Salahuddin and Datta’s group identified negative capacitance in ferroelectric materials. 
This gained significant attention in the low-power research world. The negative cap￾acitance effect reduces the required supply voltage, known as the Boltzmann limit, in 
conventional complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor transistors by amplifying 
FIGURE 3.3 Qualitative analysis of conventional MOSFET with tunnel FET and impact of 
ferroelectric on the device, and other comparisons.Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors 31
the internal voltage by reducing the internal capacitance of MOSFETs [1–12]. The 
thermodynamic perspective to understand how the reduction in energy dissipation 
is achieved and the scope of low-power development with NC FET technology is 
shown in Figure 3.3. As illustrated in Figure 3.3, the negative capacitance field effect 
transistor (NCFET) is one of the most promising emerging technologies to over￾come the fundamental limits of conventional CMOS technology. Due to the ability 
of the internal amplification and low leakage current, NCFETs have gained signifi￾cant interest. The NCFET features a ferroelectric (FE) layer within the transistor’s 
gate, which internally amplifies the voltage, allowing the NCFET to operate at a 
lower voltage while sustaining performance with considerable energy savings. The 
NCFET technology, with a thick ferroelectric layer (FE), has a voltage reduction 
which increases the leakage power, rather than decreasing it, due to the negative 
drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect. The NCFET is an emerging technology 
that incorporates a ferroelectric layer within the transistor gate stack to overcome the 
fundamental limit of sub-threshold swing in transistors [16–30].
In the sub-threshold region, the value of the capacitance of ferroelectric layer (CFE) 
should be as close as possible to (but larger than) the MOS oxide capacitance (CMOS) 
to achieve large potential amplification. However, when strong inversion of the MOS 
occurs and CMOS increases rapidly, –CFE > CMOS is still required to stabilize the NCFET. 
The desirable properties can be achieved by utilizing the polysilicon capacitance (Cpoly), 
which is a function of the applied voltage. The magnitude of the effective CFE′ (=1/(1/
CFE + 1/Cpoly)) approaches CMOS capacitance. Its value can approach the subthreshold 
region [20–30]. To maintain the constant gate control it is important to ensure accurate 
MOSFET adjustment of the drive strength by changing its size. In the NCFET, the 
non-uniform distribution of ferroelectric polarization and capacitance match are sensi￾tive to the size and tend to increase with the fluctuation of gate control [30–45].
The idea of using a ferroelectric (FE) material for transistors originates from the 
realization that internal dipolar interactions in an FE material can be exploited to 
provide an amplification of the electric field. In ferroelectric materials with the same 
energy difference between two states, N (number of electric dipoles being switched) 
and lower energy are required compared to a typical dielectric for switching. Thus, 
it can be understood that materials with interacting variables can switch their order 
with less energy compared to non-interacting state variables. Using this concept, the 
energy dissipation can be reduced by N times, where N is the number of charges that 
are ‘switched’ in each conventional transistor. In addition, the concept can be used to 
reduce the voltage needed for switching transistors between the ON and OFF states, 
and thus reducing energy dissipation in transistor switching. The two polarization 
states and corresponding energy affect the polarization of a ferroelectric material. 
The two polarization vectors are separated by an energy barrier. The energy function 
can be written as shown in Equation (3.1), where U represents the free energy of the 
ferroelectric material and is defined by the Landau–Devonshire theory:
U = αP2
 + βP4
 + γP6 (3.1)
In Equation (3.1), P is the polarization and α, β, and γ are the L-K constants. The 
charge across the ferroelectric material is shown in Equation (3.2), where E is an 32 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
external electric field and α, β, and γ are the order parameters. In the case of the ferro￾electric material, α is always negative.
QFE =ε0 EFE + P (3.2)
In Equa tion (3.2), ε0
 is the vacuum permittivity, and EFE is the electric field 
across the ferroelectric material. In the conventional MOSFET, when the ferroelec￾tric material is used as an insulator material on top of an Si channel, the overall 
electrostatic picture can be described as a series combination of two capacitors: (1) 
the ferroelectric capacitor denoted as CFE and (2) the capacitor CMOS represents the 
channel-to-drain capacitance, with other fringe capacitances between the channel and 
ground as shown in Figure 3.4. It is assumed that the ferroelectric is in steady-state 
polarization (dP/dt = 0).
These two series capacitors are nonlinear unlike the insulator capacitance in a 
standard MOSFET which is a simple linear dielectric capacitance having a parabolic 
energy equation (i.e., Q2
/2C where Q is the charge and C is the capacitance). Since both 
the capacitances are in series, the total charge in both has to be the same: QFE = Qsurface
where QFE and Qsurface are the charges of the CFE and CMOS capacitors, respectively. 
Figure 3.5 shows a conventional schematic diagram for an NCFET device and 
represents the measurement of negative capacitance in ferroelectric materials.
The total voltage shared by the two capacitors is equal to the gate voltage 
summation. In Equation (3.3), VFE and ψsurface are the voltages across the FE and the 
semiconductor capacitor, respectively.
Vg = VFE + ψsurface (3.3)
The I–V curve is steeper in the subthreshold region and goes beyond the Boltzmann 
limit at room temperature, compared to a conventional device without ferroelectric 
material (MOSFET). This indicates that the same current can be obtained at a lower 
gate voltage and therefore with less energy dissipation for a given speed of operation 
compared to a conventional MOSFET.
Figure 3.6 shows the impact on negative capacitance in transfer characteristics 
of NCFET. From Figure 3.6, it can be observed that, at the same operating voltage, 
FIGURE 3.4 Equivalent capacitance model of NCFET.Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors 33
FIGURE 3.5 Schematic of conventional NCFET and measurement of negative capacitance 
in ferroelectric materials.
FIGURE 3.6 The I–V characteristic of a Si MOSFET with and without FE capacitance.34 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
NCFET shows lower SS than conventional MOSFET with similar current. From this 
figure, it can be clearly observed that ferroelectric material in NCFET reduces the 
threshold voltage of devices with a similar off-state current. A lower threshold voltage 
with similar off-current indicates a low operational behavior, which is possible only 
with voltage amplification.
3.3 PSEUDO-ANALYTICAL SOLUTION PROCEDURE FOR 
NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE
In addition to a theoretical point of view, it often provides a better understanding if an 
analytical solution procedure is provided for a phenomenon. The pseudo-analytical 
solution gives a deeper insight into the effects of negative capacitance, such as steeper 
I–V characteristics. In NCFET having conventional MOSFET as a base device, as 
shown in Figure 3.5, the surface potential can be estimated by Equation (3.4).
ψsurface= Vg – VFE (3.4)
In the device, Csurface is a strong function of voltage and for simplicity is given as 
Qsurface/ψsurface, so that the charge can be written as shown in Equation (3.5):
Qsurface= Csurface x ψsurface= Csurface x (Vg – VFE) (3.5)
By using the charge conservation principle, the series capacitors must have the 
same charge:
QFE = ɛ0
EFE + P = Csurface (Vg –VFE) = Qsurface (3.6)
Therefore, a load line can be drawn as:
P C V ts V surface g FE = − [ (1+ ) ]
µr tFE (3.7)
In Equation (3.7), ɛr
 is the relative permittivity of dielectric Csurface and thickness, 
and t
FE is the thickness of the ferroelectric layer. The plot of P versus VFE is the hys￾teresis curve and resembles an S curve. The right-hand side acts as a load line on the 
S curve. The slope of the load line shown in the figure is Csurface[1+t
s
/(_rtFE)], and the 
intersection with the horizontal axis is Vg
[1 + ts/(ɛr
t
FE)]−1
. Therefore, if the load line 
intersects the negative slope region of the S curve, it gives a self-consistent solution 
for the nonlinear electrostatics problem of the two series capacitors, where the FE 
itself acts in the region where ∂P/∂EFE is negative. The capacitance of the FE layer is 
given as Equation (3.8):

When Equation (3.10) is satisfied, the load line intersects the S curve at multiple 
points, which denotes a hysteretic behavior. This leads to negative capacitance for the 
ferroelectric layer. The rate of change in the surface potential with respect to the gate 
voltage is given in Equation (3.11)

Equation (3.11) shows that the change in the surface potential is amplified 
compared to the supply voltage, unlike in a conventional series combination of two 
capacitors where the change in the internal node voltage will always be smaller than 
the supply voltage. This enhanced surface potential because of the negative capaci￾tance is responsible for steeper I–V characteristics in MOSFETs. Also, hysteretic 
behavior occurs when |CFE| <Csurface and

that even if ∂

<0, the ferroelectric polarization does not change its direction 
on applying an external voltage. In conclusion, the polarization always changes in 
the same direction as that of the applied field. However, the resultant field, which 
is summation of the internal and external fields across the ferroelectric, is nega￾tive in this region. Generally, negative capacitance transistors are analyzed using 
the ferroelectricity model. The mathematical series resulting from the expansion of 
Landau provides the information about the transformations in the crystal symmetry. 
Every point in the S curve corresponds to microscopic configurations of relative ion 
displacements. Integrating the electric field with respect to polarization, the potential 
energy landscape is obtained, resembling the standard Landau free energy landscape 
at zero temperature [31–55].36 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
3.4 NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE STABILITY
As the total gate capacitance is the sum of oxide and FE capacitances, the oxide 
capacitance is assumed to be a linear dielectric capacitance, as denoted by Equation 
(3.12):
Csurface = Qsurface/ψsurface (3.12)
Also, charge across the ferroelectric materials can be estimated by Equation (3.13)
QFE FE E P r s E Q urface surface = + ε ε = = ε 0 0 (3.13)

(3.18)
This equation shows that the charge is a function of the nature of the dielectric 
as well as its thickness, and decreases with increasing dielectric thickness. The 
reduction in effective charge with introduction of a dielectric layer induces depolar￾ization of the field. The addition of the depolarizing field results in changing the 
net force toward zero at smaller polarizations. Effectively, it can be perceived as 
the effect of the depolarization field , suppressing polarization. The effect of the 
depolarization field is common in ferroelectric memory devices and methods have 
been suggested to reduce this effect such as by increasing the thickness of the FE Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors 37
layer which reduces the field. Similarly, the formation of an unintended dead layer 
of dielectric between the FE and metal electrode will reduce this field. The use of 
oxide electrode prevents the formation of a dead layer. It has been seen that when 
the depolarization field is very strong the only available solution where the net force 
is zero is where the polarization is also zero. This is the region for negative cap￾acitance operation. It has been observed that by applying an external field on the 
unperturbed force–displacement curve to increase the polarization from this point, 
the FE will operate in the region where the net polarizing field is larger than the net 
depolarizing field inside the ferroelectric layer. This enhanced polarization boosts 
the electric field at the FE–dielectric (FE–DE) interface. Also, the presence of two 
stable points where the net force can be zero shows that there will be hysteresis. 
However, the polarization is still not high enough and the ferroelectric is stable. 
In this region, the ferroelectric shows negative capacitance with low hysteresis. 
Although it is not ideal for digital logic applications it is worth analyzing it experi￾mentally. The strength of the depolarization field needs to stabilize the ferroelectric 
at zero polarization [31–55].
It has been observed that the ferroelectric becomes stable in a region of the 
configuration space in which the net force on an average dipole is zero. In add￾ition, every state in the negative capacitance region corresponds with the physic￾ally defined structures of the unit cell. In summary, it can be said that it is better if 
the ferroelectric smoothly traverses the configuration space to transition to a zero￾polarization state and, for this, a second-order phase transition material is better than 
a first-order phase transition material. Also, it has been observed that, in the presence 
of substrate, strain is present, and the ferroelectric transition to zero polarization is 
difficult as it acts against the substrate strain and therefore, epitaxially grown hetero 
structures are preferable for the ferroelectric to break into domains and stabilize 
the negative capacitance state in the domain walls. However, for poly-crystalline 
ferroelectrics where such constraints from the substrate are not present, it is easier 
for the entire volume of the material to stabilize in the negative capacitance state. 
Therefore, it can be seen that polycrystalline FEs such as doped HfO2
 are more 
suitable for negative capacitance operation. It is better to sandwich the ferroelectric 
layer with an amorphous dielectric layer, which easily accommodates changes in 
strain.
It has been observed that below a certain length of the polarization vector, the 
ferroelectric operates in a region where the force due to the dipolar field dominates 
over the mechanical contribution. The field across the ferroelectric is opposite to 
external field and the overall 1/C = dV/dQ is negative. Although the analysis has 
been done for a single unit cell and considering an average effect of the surrounding 
unit cells, the spatial distribution of the polarization is not uniform or like in a 
single domain. In fact, the ferroelectric film breaks down into domains depending 
on the electrostatics of the system. However, if the polarization vectors are below 
the threshold length for negative capacitance, regions of local negative capacitance 
arise. Therefore, in FE-DE heterostructures, considering the FE polarization is 
completely uniform, only the capacitance of the FE region is negative and the total 
capacitance is always positive. Even if the FE is broken into domains, the local 
regions of negative and positive capacitances could arise in the FE film itself and 38 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
in conjunction with a series dielectric this provides greater electrostatic potential 
across the dielectric.
The state of negative capacitance is stabilized because the series combination of a 
ferroelectric and dielectric indicates a non-zero depolarization field in the FE layer. At 
zero gate voltage, the surface voltage and voltage across the FE may not be zero, but 
the sum must be zero according to Kirchhoff’s law. However, in the presence of a sig￾nificant leakage through the dielectric and FE layers, the voltage across these layers 
will be zero due to a short circuit. Thus, there is no depolarization field, and there￾fore, no negative capacitance stabilization. In a MFIS (metal–FE-metal–insulator–
semiconductor) type of structure, the FE layer is short circuited due to the internal 
metal layer in the presence of a leakage, therefore no dc stabilization of negative cap￾acitance is possible at a zero gate voltage. The FE shorting occurs due to the presence 
of significant charge density at the FE–DE interface originating from traps or tun￾neling of electrons. When the gate voltage is non-zero dc stabilization is still possible. 
Precautions are desired while studying negative capacitance experimentally, particu￾larly when high voltages are applied across an MFIS structure with a very thin oxide 
(insulator) layer because the high electric field across the structure may melt down or 
high leakage may occur. Therefore, it can be suggested that capacitance amplification 
and transistor studies should be done at a voltage much lower than the breakdown 
voltage of the dielectric used in the structure for experimental study.
3.5 FERROELECTRIC MATERIALS AND THEIR COMPATIBILITY 
WITH NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE TECHNOLOGY
It has been observed that the shape of the S curve varies according to the atomic 
coordinates of the dipoles and the local potential energy of the lattice. Therefore, 
providing a quantitative model which is necessary to predict the device design is 
not an easy task. Generally, we take a P–V curve of a thin-film FE, fit a Landau free 
energy model to it, and then construct the S curve. This approach is good for a quali￾tative analysis but not for a quantitative one, especially for the information when the 
slope of the S curve changes from negative to positive. In common practice, a set 
of experiments with varying thickness combinations in FE–DE hetero structures are 
done, and then the results are compared with the dielectric capacitance, to obtain the 
S curve. Generally, ferroelectric materials for NC transistors are required to fulfill the 
following conditions to be useful for a real device:
▪ The material should be able to show robust ferroelectricity below 5 nm 
thickness.
▪ It should be compatible with CMOS technology.
▪ The layer of FE material should be thermally stable on silicon.
▪ The deposition should be conformal on 3D substrates.
▪ It should have a large bandgap energy and conduction band offset to Si.
A lower ferroelectric thickness helps to stabilize the NC state and reduces the 
distance between neighboring NCFETs in FinFET technology. The thickness is even 
more crucial for nanowire or nanosheet devices. In addition, these materials must be Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors 39
compatible with the silicon CMOS process flow. In the CMOS process, the ferro￾electric materials should be able to withstand high temperatures as well as hydrogen 
annealing. Furthermore, there should be mature disposition techniques used that give 
conformal and homogeneous deposition for ultra-thin ferroelectric films for large 
wafers. For minimizing leakage, a high electronic bandgap as well as high conduc￾tion band offset to Si are also required.
3.6 TRANSISTORS WITH NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE
To understand the complex interaction between the FE material in the gate stack and 
the underlying FET (baseline FET) capacitance, device level modeling of FeFETs 
can provide very important insights. In this regard, transistor equations (Poisson’s 
equation and the drift-diffusion current continuity equations) must be solved self￾consistently with the Landau-Khalatnikov (L-K) equation of the FE. After the dis￾covery of doped HfO2
 as a ferroelectric oxide, there was the possibility to integrate 
an FE oxide in the transistor in the gate-stack for commercial production. Recently, a 
many transistors with negative capacitance have been demonstrated. The same con￾cept was demonstrated for the first time with Si FinFET transistors with a smaller 
geometry. Although a lot of research and development has done, the critical area for 
the realization of negative capacitance in transistors is related to capacitance patching, 
current amplification, and the various FE materials used. Capacitance matching is 
important for a MOSFET structure because the dielectric capacitor in the FE-DE 
hetero structure is related to stabilization in the negative capacitance state [31–55]. 
The semiconductor capacitance increases rapidly from a small value at low voltage to 
a higher value at larger gate voltages. This capacitance Csurface changes by two orders 
of magnitude from OFF to ON in MOSFET, which is contradictory to the require￾ment of a negative capacitance transistor design. For a lower subthreshold swing than 
60 mV/decade, the |CFE| should be matched with the Csurface at a low gate voltage. This 
implies that when the transistor turns ON, |CFE|<Csurface, there is a hysteretic region of 
operation, which is highly undesirable [20–35].
3.7 FERROELECTRICS IN THE GATE STACK OF A TRANSISTOR
NCFETs are one of the most promising emerging technologies that may overcome 
the fundamental limits of conventional CMOS technology. Due to the internal voltage 
amplification, NCFETs have drawn significant interest. NCFETs feature a ferroelec￾tric (FE) layer within the transistor’s gate, which internally amplifies the voltage, 
allowing the NCFET to operate at a lower voltage while sustaining performance with 
resulting considerable energy savings. In NCFET technology with a thick ferroelec￾tric layer, voltage reduction increases the leakage power, rather than decreasing it, 
due to the negative drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect [1–20].
3.8 EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE
The total capacitance of the ferroelectric layer which is stabilized in a negative cap￾acitance region and the series connected dielectric capacitance is greater than the 
dielectric capacitance itself and is expressed by Equation (3.19):40 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors

C C C t FE DI
= − (3.19)
Therefore,
C C C C T FE DI > > if DI
In Equation (3.19), CT, CFE
, and CDI are total, FE, and dielectric capacitance, respect￾ively. This equation shows that different matching combinations can be created by 
changing the FE capacitance. The one matching combination is when |CFE| < CDI, 
which results in capacitance enhancement with hysteresis. In the second case, when 
|CFE| > CDI, the capacitance will be enhanced with no or minimal hysteresis. Thus, 
by carefully tuning the value of CFE, the magnitude of capacitance amplification as 
well as hysteresis can be change. The first demonstration of capacitance amplification 
using an epitaxially grown bilayer FE was PZT. It is evident that the FE properties 
of the single-crystalline PZT can be controlled by changing the temperature, thus 
resulting in different capacitance matching conditions. Capacitance amplification has 
been demonstrated using different FEs. It also has been demonstrated that the contri￾bution of domain wall polarization is most important for negative capacitance because 
it is more favorable energetically for these dipoles to get suppressed. Recently, many 
other groups have shown capacitance enhancement in FE-DE hetero structures.
With the progress in silicon circuit miniaturization, lowering power consumption 
becomes the major objective. Supply voltage scaling in ultra large-scale integration 
(ULSI) is limited by the physical barrier termed ‘Boltzmann tyranny.’ Moreover, con￾siderable heat is inevitably generated from the ultra-highly integrated circuit. To solve 
these problems, a ferroelectric negative capacitance field effect transistor (Fe-NCFET) 
is proposed in order to reduce the subthreshold swing (SS) through an internal voltage 
amplification mechanism, thus effectively scaling the supply voltage and significantly 
lowering the power dissipation of ULSI. In this review, representative research results 
on NCFETs are comprehensively reviewed to suggest benefits for further study. Here, 
the background and significance of NCFETs are introduced, and the physical essence 
of the negative capacitance effect is reviewed. Then, physical models and simulation 
methods of NCFETs are classified and discussed under the consideration of three 
basic gate structures. Several influencing factors of device performance—SS, on–off 
ratio, and hysteresis—are also theoretically analyzed. Moreover, the experimental 
results of NCFETs based on different ferroelectric materials are summarized. Finally, 
with the combination of NC effect and two-dimensional materials (FinFET) and tun￾neling FET, respectively, several novel and potential NCFETs are presented, and the 
outlook for NCFETs is proposed.
3.9 TEMPERATURE EFFECT
The impact of temperature variation on negative capacitance FET is an important 
issue. It has been observed experimentally that the internal voltage amplification Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors 41
peaks of MFMIS structures depend on variation of the S-shape of the polarization 
with respect to electrical field characteristics. This amplification of internal voltage 
causes a reduction in the subthreshold swing in MFMIS structures. However, this 
effect is ineffective at a temperature near to the Curie temperature because of the 
shrinking of the NC region and saturation of the amplification. It is also reported that 
counter-clockwise rotation of the P-V loops increases the dP/dV slope with the tem￾perature. This is equivalent to an increase in the overall ferroelectric capacitance with 
temperature. In conclusion, it has been experimentally and theoretically demonstrated 
that the maximum amplification occurs at an optimum temperature.
3.10 CONCLUSION
The negative capacitance field effect transistor (NCFET) is a promising tech￾nology which exhibits lower subthreshold swing (SS) and high ON current beyond 
the limit of conventional CMOS. The key feature of NCFETs are its sub-threshold 
slope (SS) <60 mV/decade at 300 K. NCFETs are a leading emerging technology 
that promises outstanding performance in addition to better energy efficiency. The 
thickness of the added ferroelectric layer as well as the frequency and voltage are the 
key parameters that impact the power and energy of NCFET-based processors in add￾ition to the characteristics of runtime workloads. NCFETs boost the electric field at 
the semiconductor–channel interface by virtue of the gate voltage amplification effect 
of a ferroelectric (FE) layer.

4.1 INTRODUCTION
4.1.1 Background
Over the past 75 years, there has been astounding exponential growth in the efficiency 
of computations. Since the 1960s, this development has been primarily fueled through 
the shrinking of metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), the 
dimensions (lateral) of which went down to below 100 nanometers in 2003, ushering in 
the nanoelectronics age. Ever since, new materials and device designs (fin field effect 
transistors and fully depleted silicon-on-insulators) have made it possible for even more 
advancements. Nevertheless, as we approach both fundamental physical limits and 
practical restrictions, the energy efficiency advancements in nano-electronics has begun 
to decelerate recently[1–3]. The scalability of equivalent gate oxide thickness (EOT) 
and supply voltage (VDD) of MOSFETs during the last 50 years highlight two historical 
patterns in Figure 4.1 which show how close we are to some of these constraints [4].
The effective oxide thickness is described as the thickness of silicon dioxide (SiO2
) 
required to obtain the equal capacitance as an oxide in the gate with a larger relative 
permittivity (εr
) and thickness (d) since SiO2
 was initially employed as an oxide in the 
gate stack. As a result, EOT may be determined using the formula EOT = 3.9/ (εr·d) 
having an SiO2
 relative permittivity of 3.9. While decreasing VDD is the most efficient 
technique to enhance the integrated circuits efficiency, decreasing EOT is required in 
highly scaled devices to boost the electrostatic coupling of the gate to channel. Less 
voltage is required to turn the device on and off with a lower EOT because there is 
less of a drop in voltage across the gate oxide. For several decades, SiO2
 was utilized 
as an insulator material in MOSFETs based on silicon because of the superior quality 
of the Si/SiO2
 junction and its flexibility for fabrication. Quantum-mechanical elec￾tron tunneling through the gate dielectric increased to such a large extent beyond the 
446 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
physical thickness of oxide of around 3 nm so that it began to considerably donate 
to the overall power dissipation [2,5–7]. As a result, at the start of the 20th century, 
nitrided SiO2
 gate dielectrics were used to elevate εr
 to about 5 and lower the EOT 
to below 2 nm. To maintain future scaling of EOT, nitrided SiO2
 (SiON) has to be 
superseded soon after the debut of the dielectrics with even higher εr
 [6].
The end result was the introduction of the so-called high-k metal gate (HKMG) 
technology in 2007 which relies on amorphous hafnium dioxide (HfO2
) dielectrics 
with εr
 approximately equivalent to 17, which enabled the scaling down of EOT to 
0.8 nm in more recent devices [6]. However, EOT scaling down to 0.5 nm is essen￾tially not conceivable without significantly reducing device performance and reli￾ability due to the intrinsic presence of a thin SiO2
 interface layer between the high-k 
dielectric and the silicon channel [8]. Even though the EOT could be zero, a more 
basic constraint precludes further decreasing VDD, which is required to increase the 
integrated circuit’s efficiency. In order to simultaneously obtain adequate results [high 
ON current (I
ON)] and static power usage [minimum OFF current (I
OFF)] in any trad￾itional FET, a high appropriate ratio of drain current (I
D) in the ON condition and in 
the OFF condition needs to be guaranteed. It has emerged that the fundamental lower 
bound for the gate voltage (VG) required to modify the drain current at ambient tem￾perature is 60 mV/decade owing to the Boltzmann distribution of carriers [9,10]. This 
‘Boltzmann limit’ prevents the voltage supply from being decreased in traditional 
MOSFETs below about 0.5 V, which is not far from the 0.7 V employed in current 
technology, as shown in Figure 4.1.
Subthreshold swing is defined as the gate voltage needed to alter the current of 
a device by a decade in the subthreshold region. Mathematically, the subthreshold 
swing (SS) can be denoted as [9]:

where ID is drain current, VG is gate voltage, Ψs
 is the surface potential, T is the 
temperature, q is the charge, KB is the Boltzmann constant, and Cin and Cs
 are 
the gate insulator and semiconductor capacitance, respectively. Several different 
approaches are currently being explored to address the Boltzmann tyranny issue 
of conventional transistors. Examples includes tunneling field effect transistors 
(TFETs) [11], nano-electromechanical switches (NEMs) [12], ionization metal 
oxide semiconductor transistors (IMOSs) [13,14], and negative field effect 
transistors (NCFETs) [10]. The first three methods adjust the transport mech￾anism, that is the manner in which electrons move within a transistor, in order to 
avoid hitting the 2.3 KBT/q minimum limit and normally these devices have a low 
ON current. On the other hand, in NCFET it has been theoretically demonstrated 
that it might be conceivable to preserve the transport mechanism while altering 
the electrostatic gating to raise the transistor’s surface potential above what is nor￾mally feasible.
In Equation (4.4), Cs
 and Cin are normally positive numbers and therefore according 
to the capacitive voltage divider rule 
∂

 they will always be greater than 1. In 2008, 
Salahuddin and Datta originally suggested that if Cin is less than 0 in a traditional 
FET in Equation (4.3), one may circumvent the Boltzmann limit, which would allow 
further lowering of VDD and, consequently, power dissipation of MOSFET [10]. In 
this circumstance, the negative capacitance (NC) would cause the surface potential to 
be internally amplified in relation to the applied gate voltage. Hence, in order to fur￾ther enhance the energy efficiency of devices, one may circumvent both the looming 
EOT and the Boltzmann constraints in a negative capacitance field effect transistor 
(NCFET).
4.1.2 Ferroelectrics
The discovery of switchable polarization behavior in Rochelle salt by Valasek in 1920 
served as the catalyst for the development of ferroelectricity. To put it simply, a sub￾stance is considered to have ferroelectricity or to be a ferroelectric if it can manifest 
two possible equilibrium polarization states with opposing orientations even without 
an external electric field or spontaneous polarization [15]. Additionally, applying an 
electric field must be able to flip between these states. It is important to highlight that 
the ferroelectrics are a subset of a larger family of substances known as pyroelectrics 48 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
that have a distinctive polar axis. Nevertheless, not all pyroelectrics may have the 
ability to reverse polarization, unlike ferroelectrics. The spontaneous polarization in 
crystalline ferroelectrics results from an asymmetry in the ionic configurations within 
a unit cell.
Ferroelectrics are a unique family of materials that exhibit polarization even in 
the absence of an electric field. It is possible to reverse this spontaneous polariza￾tion, which results from a noncentrosymmetric structure, by applying an electric field 
that is stronger than the coercive field [15]. Ferroelectrics are perfect for nonvolatile 
memory systems since this typically results in polarization hysteresis [16]. Even 
though each ferroelectrics are both piezoelectric and pyroelectric, these substances 
are utilized in devices like detectors (infrared) and ultrasonic transducers. Further, 
ferroelectrics are advantageous in microwave electronics because their permittivity is 
dependent on the applied electric field. In addition, the ferroelectric permittivity can 
even turn negative under specific circumstances. The ferroelectric changes itself to 
paraelectric with zero spontaneous polarization above the Curie temperature.
Most ferroelectrics have a crystalline structure of perovskite material. Take BaTiO3
as an example of a ferroelectric of the perovskite (ABO3) type [17]. The usual stoi￾chiometry of the perovskite structure is ABO3, where cations are ‘A’ and ‘B’ and ‘O’ 
is an anion. At high temperatures, it displays a cubic form, as seen in Figure 4.2(a). 
In this instance, the unit cell carries a satisfying centrosymmetry. As a result, in this 
condition, the net polarization is zero, and is also known as the paraelectric phase. As 
seen in Figures 4.2(b) and 4.2(c), it goes through a phase transition and becomes a 
tetragonal unit cell when the temperature is lowered below 120°C. Curie temperature 
is a term used to describe the transition temperature. A permanent dipole moment 
is created when the central Ti atom in the new tetragonal phase is adjusted either 
upwards or downwards along the c-axis. In general, this attribute can be acquired 
through any one of the six orientations along the coordinate axes. The entire ferro￾electric volume breaks into domains, which are areas of uniform polarization, in order

 structure: (a) for temperatures greater than Curie temperature (cubic 
phase); (b) and (c) for temperatures less than Curie temperature (tetragonal phase) with two 
different polarization orientations.Basic Operation Principle of NCFET 49
to decrease the ferroelectric material energy for specific electrical and mechanical 
boundary conditions. Domain walls are the physical barriers that divide the domains.
According to Figure 4.3, the polarization exhibits a hysteresis characteristic when 
an electric field is applied to a ferroelectric material [18]. It also fluctuates nonlinearly 
under this condition. Consequently, the net polarization is zero, as indicated by point 
O in Figure 4.3, in the primarily formed ferroelectric sample, since all of the domains 
are initially randomly orientated. Domains begin to align and polarization intensifies 
along the path OP as the electric field increases. The polarization begins to saturate as 
the electric field increases from P to Q. All the domains align in the same direction at 
Q. In simple terms, the ferroelectric in this condition exhibits single domain behavior. 
Due to the fact that not all domains are misaligned, the removal of the electric field 
from Q to R does not reduce the polarization to zero. The term ‘remnant polarization’ 
refers to the polarization value at point R. A coercive field (Ec
), also known as an 
opposing electric field of quantity, must be applied in order to reduce the polarization 
to zero. Domains are aligned in the opposite manner from S to T as the electric field 
increases further. The ferroelectric follows the path T to U to Q, causing a hysteresis 
loop if the electric field is swept forward once again [18]. As a result, the ferroelectric 
develops a memory since the polarization value at any given electric field depends 
on the material’s history. In general, the physical technique of a ferroelectric’s polar￾ization switching dynamics is a complex process that involves the formation of new 
domains and their continuous expansion in response to an opposite electric field.
One of the most researched classes of ferroelectrics is perovskite. Additional 
examples of this group are bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3
), lead titanate (PbTiO3
), lead zir￾conium titanate (PbZrx
Ti1-x

), barium strontium titanate (BaSrx

), and recently 
discovered doped HfO2
-based ferroelectrics such as hafnium zirconium oxide (Hfx
Zr1-

O2
), silicon-doped hafnium oxide, and hafnium aluminum oxide [19–21]. Due to 
their compatibility with the CMOS manufacturing process, HfO2
-based ferroelectrics 
are extremely important for the semiconductor industry. As a result, it is now pos￾sible to incorporate a ferroelectric layer inside a traditional FET for applications like 
memory and extremely low-power switching [22,23]. In addition to these inorganic

4.1.3  Negative Capacitance
In 2008, Salahuddin and Datta described a plan to navigate the impassable negative 
slope section [10]. They recommended adding a second dielectric layer in series with 
the ferroelectric so that the system’s overall energy has a minimum at P = 0, as shown 
in Figure 4.4. In order to keep the total curvature positive, the dielectric must have 
a positive curvature that is sufficiently large to counteract the ferroelectric’s nega￾tive curvature. A device that stores charge is known as a capacitor. The rate at which 
a charge Q increases with voltage V is known as a device’s capacitance (C = dQ
dV ). 
Therefore, by concept, for a negative capacitor, Q drops as V increases. Capacitance 
can also be understood in the context of the free energy U. The energy landscape of 
a negative capacitor is a reversed parabola. U Q
C = 2
2 applies to a linear capacitor. The 
capacitance can be explained in terms of free energy using the following definition:
C
d U
dQ
= 

 

(4.5)
The nonlinear capacitor is also subject to the same relationship. In other words, 
a negative capacitance corresponds to the region of negative curve in an insulating 
material’s energy landscape.
In order for negative capacitance to be stable, the following conditions must be 
fulfilled:

Equation (4.6).
4.2 BASIC OPERATION PRINCIPLES OF NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE 
FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS
The negative capacitance effect makes it possible to overcome the Boltzmann 
limitation and supported steep switching operation in ferroelectric materials. As 
can be seen in Figure 4.5(a), the ferroelectric material is incorporated into the gate 
stack of a regular MOSFET to construct a negative capacitance FET (NCFET) 
[18]. The basic MOS arrangement behaves as the dielectric that can maintain 
the ferroelectric’s negative capacitance condition. The ferroelectric therefore 
produces an amplification in internal voltage because of the negative capacitance 
characteristic of ferroelectric, which can be determined from the equivalent 
voltage divider circuit of the NCFET presented in Figure 4.5(b). Ferroelectrics 
are advantageous for tunable capacitors in microwave electronics because their 
permittivity is dependent on the applied electric field. The ferroelectric permit￾tivity may even turn negative in some circumstances. The ferroelectric changes 
into a paraelectric phase above the Curie temperature, where spontaneous polar￾ization is zero.
FIGURE 4.5 (a) Structure of NCFET; (b) circuit model of NCFET.52 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
In linear dielectrics, electric polarization is directly related to the electric field, 
leading to the displacement field (D) = εo

E. The ferroelectric permittivity can be 
realized from the displacement field formula as:

where EF
 represents the ferroelectric’s electric field and PS
 is spontaneous polariza￾tion. Thus, a ferroelectric’s nonlinear permittivity and, consequently, capacitance 
would be negative when the polarization in the ferroelectric changes in the opposite 
direction of the electric field. The possibility of a negative capacitance as a result of 
ferroelectric polarization instability was initially foreseen by Landauer in 1976. The 
justification was established on a straightforward thermodynamic model developed 
by Landauer known as the Landau model [25], in which the free energy of ferroelec￾tric can be represented as
U P P E P F S S F s = ⋅ α β + ⋅ − 2 4 (4.10)
where α and β are Landau coefficients and below Curie temperature alpha is less than 
zero and beta is greater than zero. Figure 4.6(a) presents the free energy versus polar￾ization landscape at EF
 = 0, considering a second-order phase transition. The maxima 
at Ps
 = 0 represents an unstable state, whereas the two minimum energy levels indi￾cate a stable polarization condition [26]. The equation for the electric field is obtained 
by minimizing UF
 with respect to Ps
 in Figure 4.6(b) as:
E P P F s S = ⋅ 2 4 ⋅ + ⋅ ⋅ 3 α β (4.11)
FIGURE 4.6 (a) Polarization versus free energy; (b) polarization versus electric field.Basic Operation Principle of NCFET 53
Since α <0, it is clear that the permittivity should always be negative for low values 
of Ps
, resulting in an ‘S’-shaped negative slope and a curve (negative) for the energy 
landscape [27]. It is instantly obvious from Figure 4.6(a) that the area having nega￾tive permittivity (i.e., negative capacitance) is unstable thermodynamically because 
if the ferroelectric is taken in isolation, it relates directly to a maximal free energy. 
There are two approaches to access the negative capacitance region: (1) If we apply 
an electric field to flip the polarization of the ferroelectric from one stable condition 
to another, transient negative capacitance should be observed during switching for a 
brief time period [28]. (2) We include the ferroelectric into a bigger structure so that, 
when the system’s total free energy is minimized, the negative capacitance condition 
becomes stable thermodynamically.
4.2.1 Metal Ferroelectric Metal (MFM) Capacitor
Consider an ideal metal ferroelectric metal (MFM) capacitor which is transitioning 
through a negative to a positive polarization condition shown in Figure 4.7(a). For 
varying stages in the switching operation, the energy landscapes of the ferroelectric 
are depicted in Figures 4.7(b)–4.7(f). When the external voltage is zero, the landscape 
is firstly symmetric and polarization is negative. As shown in Figure 4.7(c), a voltage 
FIGURE 4.7 Switching process of a MFM capacitor: (a) structure of MFM at given voltage

greater than zero will cause the curve to tilt to the right side, lifting the energy minima 
of the left side and decreasing the barrier. When the given voltage is greater than the 
critical voltage (VC), the barrier disappears and polarization passes over the negative 
capacitance area till it hits the appropriate minima, as shown in Figure 4.7(d). Further, 
as the external voltage is reduced below the coercive voltage, the energy barrier will 
reappear, keeping the polarization in the right minima, as illustrated in Figures 4.7(e) 
and 4.7(f). The MFM capacitor, however, will constantly remain in a positive capaci￾tance condition when switching takes place in the ferroelectric because of the 
unstable nature of the NC region [27].
In these circumstances, it is obvious that the polarization will usually rise with 
time [(dPS
/dt) greater than 0]. As a result, during switching in the transient negative 
capacitance (TNC) condition, the voltage and, consequently, ferroelectric field must 
drop with time [(dEF
/dt) less than 0]. As PS
 is rising with time, it is clear that a tran￾sient negative effect will result if PS
 changes more quickly than the metal free charge. 
One approach to witness this TNC experimentally is to apply a voltage through the 
serial construction between a metal ferroelectric metal capacitor and an additional 
circuit component, such as a resistor, a dielectric capacitor, or even the gate of a 
MOSFET [29]. The added circuit component will slow down the flow of screening 
charge to the MFM capacitor from an external circuit while simultaneously allowing 
the voltage of ferroelectric to decline with time while the given voltage rises [30]. 
In addition, there are two significant drawbacks to using transient negative capaci￾tance in applications: (1) Transient negative capacitance is generally linked to an 
enormous hysteresis, which is harmful for energy-efficient applications because it 
causes dissipation of power and demands an increment in the supplied voltage [31]. 
(2) According to the established trade-off between voltage and time, transitioning a 
ferroelectric entirely through one stable polarization phase to the other can only be 
accomplished rapidly with a high voltage or slowly require with a low voltage, not 
both at the same time[32,33]. Thus, transient negative capacitance effects are there￾fore too sluggish for higher speed circuits that operate at lower voltage and giga hertz 
frequencies [34]. These two limitations are a primary outcome of the instability of the 
negative capacitance state. Theoretically, we could, however, get beyond both of these 
restrictions if we could stabilize the inherent NC state [35].
4.2.2 Metal Ferroelectric Insulator Metal Capacitor
Salahuddin and Datta first proposed that a positive capacitance may be introduced in 
series with the ferroelectric capacitance to stabilize the ferroelectric NC condition at 
PS
 = 0[10]. As a result, there would be zero polarization hysteresis and the system’s 
overall capacitance will be positive. It has recently been established that the impact 
of domain creation and leakage current, which destabilize the negative capacitance 
state, make a stabilization like this implausible when an MFM capacitor is used seri￾ally with a metal dielectric metal capacitor [36,37]. Thus, there shouldn’t be a metal 
layer between the positive capacitance layer and the ferroelectric layer [36,38,39].
To comprehend the fundamentals of NC stabilization, the free energy concept is 
utilized for metal ferroelectric insulator metal capacitor configuration. The dielectric’s 
free energy with the electric field (ED) and relative permittivity (ε D) can be defined as:Basic Operation Principle of NCFET 55

where TD and TF
 are dielectric thickness and ferroelectric thickness, respectively. The 
ferroelectric negative capacitance phase would be stabilized when the part in paren￾theses in Equation (4.12) turns positive, because the curve of UT with reference to PS
is always positive and, therefore, the overall capacitance will be positive, which can 
be defined as follows:
T T
T
F F critical
D
D
≤ = − ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 2 0 α ε ε
(4.15)
Nevertheless, particularly without the D⊕ PS
 assumption, TF, critical is indirectly pro￾portional to the dielectric capacitance [36]. Now consider the situation when TF
 is 
greater than TF, critical (for instance, if the insulator layer is much thinner), where free 
energy for various voltages are presented in Figures 4.8(a)–4.8(f), presuming that PS
is primarily negative. The ferroelectric is depolarized by the dielectric in comparison 
to the ideal metal ferroelectric metal scenario in Figure 4.7, which lowers the energy 
barrier in UT and reduces spontaneous polarization. The ferroelectric maintains a 
positive capacitance at VS
 = 0 in Figure 4.8(b). Unscreened polarization causes a 
positive field of depolarization in the ferroelectric and an opposing negative field in 
the insulator. The depolarization phenomenon causes the ferroelectric field to sig￾nificantly drop and PS
 shifts to the positive direction when VS
 is raised above VC as 
shown in Figure 4.8(d), producing a transient negative capacitance as in Figure 4.7. 
After that, when VS
 is zeroed out, PS
 remains in the positive energy minima, as shown 
in Figures 4.8(e) and 4.8(f).
Figures 4.9(a)–4.9(c) depict the interesting situation where TF
 is less than or equal 
to TF, critical. In this situation, the stack’s total free energy is reduced at VS
 = 0, which 
causes the negative capacitance state at PS
 = 0 to become stable [Figure 4.9(b)]. The 
maxima of UF
 and the minima of UD and UT now coincide. When a positive voltage is 
given [Figure 4.9(c)], PS
 rises while EF
 falls as a result of the dielectric’s depolariza￾tion field, so that dPS
/dEF
 < 0. Although the curve of UT (hence the total capacitance) 
will always be positive, this overall system is stable [39]. The ferroelectric will tran￾sition into a condition of positive capacitance when VS
 is raised over a critical voltage 
VC [Figure 4.9(d)]. However, after the voltage is subsequently decreased to zero, the 56 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
ferroelectric reverts to its earlier negative capacitance condition [Figures 4.9(e) and 
4.9(f)]. In the entire range of operation, there are negligible instabilities (no negative 
curve of UT), hence no hysteresis is anticipated. This runs contrary to the previously 
stated temporary NC effect.
There are additional effects to take into account when switching from the simpler 
capacitors to NCFET devices, as illustrated in Figures 4.8 and 4.9. First, as the semi￾conductor channel transitions from the depletion to the inversion zone, the stabilizing 
positive capacitance is very nonlinear. As a result, the thickness of the ferroelectric 
range where negative capacitance can be stabilized through the entire range of oper￾ation is substantially lowered. The utilization of reduced density of states channel 
materials, as mentioned by Cao and Banerjee, may be advantageous for the configur￾ation of NCFET devices [40]. Secondly, particularly in short channel devices with 
inhomogeneous channel potential, the drain voltage can have a local effect on the 
NC stability. Therefore, domains may arise and the ferroelectric polarization will 
also become irregular. As a result, domains may arise and the ferroelectric polariza￾tion will also become irregular. However, simulations show that even at large drain 
voltages, hysteresis-free stable NC is still feasible [41]. It has been demonstrated that 
FIGURE 4.8 Stabilizing NC in a ferroelectric-dielectric hetero-structure with VS

rising drain voltage in the NCFET causes the channel potential to decrease, which 
results in negative drain-induced barrier lowering and negative differential resistance 
in the output characteristics [42,43].
The ferroelectric negative capacitance has been demonstrated to be an unstable 
condition in preceding sections, and in a secluded ferroelectric capacitor, the NC 
phases can only be addressed in a time-dynamic manner. This section outlines how 
the addition of a positive capacitor serially stabilizes the ferroelectric NC condition. 
The studies in this part are significant because stabilizing the ferroelectric negative 
capacitance is necessary to decrease the subthreshold swing in a field effect transistor. 
The effective capacitance is increased relative to the respective dielectric as an out￾come of the stabilization of the ferroelectric NC.
Figure 4.10 illustrates a schematic of the P–E curve and channel charge of NCFET. 
To determine the operating point of a ferroelectric MOS capacitor, the polarization 
and channel charge density must coincide. Therefore, the point where the P–E curve 
and the channel charge load line cross is used to determine the static operating point 
of NCFET as depicted in Figure 4.10. Ferroelectric MOS transistors function as 
NCFETs when the P–E curve has a mono crossing point in the negative capacitance

region. In contrast to a traditional MOSFET, when gate voltage (Vg
) is provided the 
NCFET produces a negative oxide field on the insulator of gate. The operating point 
(a) in Figure 4.10 shifts to (b) when the gate voltage is increased and the oxide field 
(negative) enlarges even more. As illustrated in Figure 4.10, the band tilts more than 
the supplied gate voltage. As a result, the NCFET is able to generate a larger current 
than traditional MOSFETs because the potential of the surface is efficiently amplified 
against the gate voltage and more charges are produced in the channel. The 
operating point now shifts to (c) as the gate voltage is increased more and the field 
of oxide switches, and finally the band diagram resembles that of typical MOSFETs. 
The charge density of the channel in the MOS capacitor is lesser in the subthreshold 
area and rises by √Ψs
, whereas it is large in the strong inversion area and rises by e(qΨs/
2kT). The density of charge in the channel needs to be large enough to meet the ferro￾electric polarization in the strong inversion area instead of the subthreshold area in 
order to utilize the negative oxide voltage. Due to this, the threshold voltage decreases 
and a steeper slope is mostly seen beyond the threshold region.
4.3 CONCLUSION
In this chapter, the basic NCFET structure, its characteristics, and operation with 
its stabilization process are described. To overcome the Boltzmann constraint and 
allow steep switching action, the ferroelectric negative capacitance phenomenon can 
be utilized. A NCFET has basically the same structure as a conventional MOSFET, 
only a ferroelectric material is incorporated in the gate stack. The basic MOS con￾figuration serves as the dielectric that can help in stabilization of the ferroelectric’s 
negative capacitance condition. The ferroelectric therefore provides an amplification 
in the internal voltage as a result of its negative capacitance characteristic that can 
be determined from the corresponding voltage-divider circuit of an NCFET. Besides 
lowering SS, the voltage gain can be utilized to enhance the charge density of the 
channel in the inversion operation region, which results in a higher ON current in 
NCFETs compared to traditional MOSFETs. Additionally, various advantages of 
using NCFET devices include having lower subthreshold slope, negligible hysteresis, 
FIGURE 4.10 Polarization–electric field (P–E) and load line of channel.Basic Operation Principle of NCFET 59
improved ON current, and reduced subthreshold swing. In view of the aforemen￾tioned parameters, the NCFET is a promising replacement for the MOSFET for high￾speed, cost-effective, and ultra-low-power circuits. Numerous research works have 
backed the use of NCFET as an ultra-low-power transistor in the future. However, 
for commercial production, there are various challenges that must be resolved such 
as (a) the solution for a HfO2
-based, 1-nm ferroelectric layers in particular, with 
appropriate controllability of imperfections and thickness, (b) the in-depth explan￾ation of random variations of NCFET, and (c) the process instructions for capacitance 
matching in wafer-level procedures. Finally, NCFET has garnered outstanding results 
in numerous applications such as memories, ultra-low power devices, inverters, the 
Internet of Things, radio frequency sensing, analog circuits, filters, and biomedical 
devices.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
So far, there has been a continuous and steady growth of the market for mobile com￾puting devices, wireless systems, and biomedical implantable devices [1–5]. This 
has led to a consistent growth in the demand for low-power circuits and systems. 
The current CMOS technology could not fulfill these requirements owing to the 
non-scalability of the threshold voltage (VTH) due to immutable subthreshold swing 
(SS), leading to greater leakage of current for low-power circuit operation [6–8]. 
With the recent advent of semiconductor technology, the performance of conven￾tional FETs has been steadily improved by scaling down the feature size. However, 
the operating voltage cannot be scaled down with the channel length scaling because 
the subthreshold slope (SS) cannot be reduced below 60 mV/decade (Boltzmann 
tyranny) [9–15]. The demand for low-power VLSI circuits and systems has been 
fulfilled by MOSFET by continuous scaling of supply voltage (VDD) and technology 
scaling [16–20]. The scaling of MOSFET have been the critical driving factor in 
improving the energy efficiency. However, supply voltage (VDD) scaling is limited 
to the near threshold (VTH) region of classical MOSFET [21–24]. Reducing VDD
much below VTH leads to a significant loss in speed and energy efficiency [25–29]. 
This phenomenon is directly related to the fundamental limit of 60 mV/decade on 
the SS at room temperature (300 K) for MOSFETs. Surpassing and overcoming this 
limit could enable more aggressive VDD scaling, leading to ultra-low-power dissi￾pation. Therefore, devices that exhibit steep switching characteristics (i.e., SS < 60 
mV/decade at room temperature) are being actively and widely explored [13–19]. 
Several steep slope devices have emerged in the recent past owing to their promise 
5Anti-ferroelectric and Ferroelectric Materials 63
to deliver higher ON-state current at lower voltages compared to the standard 
MOSFETs [30–37].
5.2 NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE
In general, capacitance is the ratio of charge to voltage in any material. In other words, 
capacitance is the charge store/hold per unit volt in any material. This feature can be iden￾tified when material is kept between two electrodes that are suitable to tune the applied 
voltage across the material (Figure 5.1). The capacitance of the material is given by:
C Q
V = (5.1)
where, C, Q, and V represent capacitance, charge, and applied voltage, respectively. 
It is one phase or very usual feature of materials which reflect that as one increases 
the applied voltage across the material it accumulates more and more charge inside 
the material and vice versa. Now, we can talk about the effects of very small changes 
in applied voltage resulting in the charge accumulation feature of the material which 
is preferably applicable in the operation of low-power devices and can be express as:
C dQ
dV = (5.2)
where, dQ is small changes in the charges on a very small applied voltage dV. In 
materials, this capacitance reflects different features at different scales, and especially 
at nanoscale dimensions it become more prominent owing to its size, shape, stoichio￾metric composition, phases, etc.
The capacitance feature/behavior can be also analyzed by calculating the total energy 
stored in the material sandwich between metals/electrodes and can be expressed as:
stored energy( ) U = Q
C

FIGURE 5.1 Schematic diagram of a parallel plate capacitor with dielectric material.64 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
Therefore, the capacitance can be expressed in terms of stored energy as:
C
d U
dQ
= 

 


1

(5.3)
This is the inverse of second-order differentiation of stored energy with respect 
to charges. In general, it very well known that as voltages increase the accumulated 
charge increases, as shown in Figure 5.2(a) and its respective variation of the stored 
energy with respect to an increase in the charges reflects the molecular phase sta￾bility inside the material [Figure 5.2(b)]. This type of material behavior varies between 
materials.
Some materials have unusual phases where the accumulation of charges 
increases with a decrease in the applied voltage across the materials and vice versa 
[Figure 5.2(c)]. In such cases, the stored energy is also a function of charge accumu￾lation but it reflects an inverted parabolic shape that means the molecular phase of 
this type of materials is unstable [Figure 5.2(d)]. In other words, we can say that it 
FIGURE 5.2 Schematic diagram of (a) charge-voltage of a dielectric material, (b) energy￾charge response of a dielectric material, (c) charge-voltage of a negative capacitive material, 
and (d) energy-charge response of a negative capacitive material.Anti-ferroelectric and Ferroelectric Materials 65
reflects a quick transitional situation in the phase of the material. This charge storage 
phenomenon/feature is known as the negative capacitance of the material.
To understand this, let’s consider a simple example of a parallel plate capacitor 
as shown in Figure 5.1, where, when the voltage is applied across the material’s two 
opposite surfaces, the capacitance can be calculated by
C
A
t = ε ε0 r (5.4)
where, ԑ₀, ԑᵣ, A, and t are vacuum permittivity, relative permittivity, area of one side 
surface, and thickness of the material, respectively. As voltage is applied, an electric 
field is developed across the surface leading to the creation of an additional field 
inside the material known as the displacement field, which is given by
D E = + ε ε P 0 r (5.5)
where, D, E, and P represent the displacement field, electric field development 
through the applied voltage, and electric polarization, respectively.
The displacement field is dependent on the relative permittivity and polarization feature 
of the material. Polarization is the induced dipole moment per unit volume, and greatly 
depends on the features of the atoms or molecules available inside the material. Therefore, 
it varies from material to material as well as with material size, and such features are gen￾erally reflected in the dielectric material owing to its tightly bound positive and negative 
charges. On application of the electric field when it is polarized is shown in Figure 5.3, in 
which polarization is directly proportional to the electric field, and given by
P N= αE (5.6)
where, N and α are the number of atoms per unit volume and atomic/molecular 
polarizability proportionality constant. Thus, a small change in the electric field leads 
to variation in the displacement field, which can be expressed as
FIGURE 5.3 Schematic representation of polar and non-polar molecules/atoms orientation 
in the absence of applied electric field and in the presence of applied electric field as in the set￾up of parallel plate capacitor mode.66 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
dD
dE
= + ε ε Nα 0 r (5.7)
Therefore, one can say that the value of dD/dE can be positive or negative 
depending upon the relative permittivity and atomic/molecular polarizability of the 
material. If D is directly and linearly proportional to applied E in a material, then dD/
dE will always be positive, and this happens in linear dielectric materials. However, 
there are some materials available in the system that are made up of such types of 
molecules/species, which have their own random dipole moment, revealing non￾linear dependency on the applied electric field E of displacement field D, which 
are known as non-linear dielectric materials. This means dD/dE = ԑ₀ԑᵣ may be nega￾tive, i.e., permittivity will be negative, which reflects negative capacitance (NC). In 
general, such a phenomenon could be possible with ferroelectric, ferrielectric, and 
antiferroelectric materials.
5.3 ORIGINS OF NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE IN FERROELECTRICS
Ferroelectric materials are among the most used materials in devices that reflect per￾manent spontaneous polarization even in the absence of an external electric field 
owing to their non-centrosymmetric crystal structure that can be reversed under the 
influence of a stronger external electric field as compared to their coercive field [38]. 
Such characteristics in materials are more useful in memory storage devices due 
to their flipping polarization as a function of the electric field [39]. This tuning in 
the polarization of such crystal-structured materials is also done through variations 
in temperature and the application of stress to utilize their features in ultrasonic 
transducers and infrared detectors [40].
The spontaneous permanent polarization of the material depends on its existing 
molecular structure. Therefore, permanent polarization in any material is the result 
of its constituent features and the material which has been made up of a set of 
molecules which contains one or more stable molecules. These molecules change 
their constituent atom positions with time due to any external forces applied on 
them. For example, a unit cell (as a representative) of ferroelectric material is shown 
in Figure 5.4(a), where the central atom (blue) is situated in the upper half (i) of the 
unit cell and as the applied potential/voltage increases on the ferroelectric material, 
the central blue atom starts moving to the lower half portion (ii) of the unit cell 
and comes to a stable position in the lower half part of the unit cell as shown in 
Figure 5.5(b). As the applied potential/voltage starts to decrease across the ferroelec￾tric it starts to move to its original/initial position, i.e., it shifts to the upper 
half of the unit cell as shown in Figure 5.5(a). This complete position transition 
phenomenon in the unit cell defines the material polarization direction or flipping 
polarization with an external electric field. This complete phenomenon of polariza￾tion as a function of an external electric field can be represented as a hysteresis 
loop, as shown in Figure 5.5(c), in which the blue atom position in the upper half is 
represented in the first quadrant while the reverse position i.e., the blue atom lower 
half position, is represented in the third quadrant. The second and fourth quadrant Anti-ferroelectric and Ferroelectric Materials 67
positions are very sharply changed as compared to the first and third quadrants with 
an electric field, i.e., it is the position of instability of the blue atom in the unit cell. 
This position of instability is also reflected in the stored energy versus polarization 
plot [Figure 5.4(d)]. This unstable blue atom position between positions (i) and (ii) 
is represented in Figure 5.5 within the energy range, i.e., between the stable position, 
an unstable position of the atom exists, as shown by the half inverted parabola shape. 
The unstable position energy range starts from zero to nearly half of the stable pos￾ition energy with respect to positive and negative polarization within the external 
critical electric field, as shown between the dashed line that represents the negative 
capacitance region [Figures 5.5(a,b)]. The Ef
–1
 versus Ps
 plot represents the unstable 
regions, i.e., (iii) in Figure 5.5(c).
Further, the polarization is a result of dipole moments that are influenced by the 
permittivity and electric field of the ferroelectric materials, due to which ferroelectric 
materials are used in microwave electronics so widely [40]. There could be a prob￾able condition during which it reflects negative permittivity in the process of polar 
FIGURE 5.4 Schematic representation of atom motion within a ferroelectric unit cell/
compound with a change in applied voltage across it (a, b). (c) The polarization versus applied

energy-polarization plot that reflects two stable positions of the ferroelectric material.68 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
transition from one direction to another under the influence of an external electric 
field. These materials reveal linear as well as non-linear dielectric responses.
One can neglect the linear dielectric (means P = P) response to estimate qualita￾tive behavior in the presence of an electric field Ef

approximated as

Therefore, in general, we can say that when polarization changes its direction 
under an electric field, its permittivity will be negative and, thus, resultant capacitance 
will be negative. The first prediction of possible negative capacitance in ferroelec￾tric materials was done by Landauer in 1976 on the basis of the Landau model [6]. 
This model considers thermodynamic Gibbs free energy (Gf
) to evaluate ferroelectric 
behavior, which was expressed as
G P P E P f s s f s = + α β − 2 4 (5.9)
where, α and β are Landau coefficients that have negative (i.e., α ˂ 0) and positive 
(i.e., β ˃ 0) values below Curie temperature. Now, for visualization of Equation (5.8), 
consider a case when Ef
 = 0 and only second-order phase transition is taking place in 
Gf
, then Gibbs free energy reveals two minima (Figure 5.5d). One minima exists in 
the negative polarization region and another exists in the positive polarization while 
in between there is a maxima at zero polarization (i.e., at Ps
 = 0).
These Gibbs free energy minima and maxima are attributed to stable and unstable 
polarization states of the ferroelectric material since, for the stable polarization state, 
the Gibbs free energy should be a minimum.

Equations (5.7) and (5.10) illustrate that permittivity is dependent on the α, β, and 
Ps
 values. It is clear that for smaller values of Ps
 the permittivity must be negative 
owing to the negative slope of the graph in figure, and since α is always negative. 
This description of negative permittivity (i.e., negative capacitance) was based on 
the thermodynamical parameters which express the unstable negative permittivity 
corresponding to maximum Gibbs free energy. It is now possible to implement this in 
the devices, as explained below.
There are two possible ways to observe the negative permittivity inside a ferro￾electric material. First, one can observe it during the switching of the polarization 
state from positive to negative or vice versa for a limited time interval known as the 
transient negative capacitance. Second, one can sandwich the ferroelectric material 
inside a larger sized material such that the negative permittivity state becomes thermo￾dynamically stable and overall Gibbs free energy stays at the minimum.
5.3.1  Transient Negative Capacitance
To understand this, let’s consider an ideal metal-ferroelectric-metal parallel plate cap￾acitor where polarization changes from negative to positive as a function of the applied 
voltage (Figure 5.6a). The different polarization state positions can be represented by 
ferroelectric energy landscape sketch diagrams at various applied potential values, 
such as V = 0, 0 ˂ V ˂ Vc
, V = Vc
, V ˃ Vc
, 0 ˂ V ˂ Vc
, and V = 0, etc. (Figures 5.6b–f). 
Initially, in the absence of an external potential (i.e., V = 0), the energy landscape is 
symmetric about Gibbs energy (Gf
) and the polarization is negative, which represents 
the stable state.
A small positive potential application lifts the left side minimum energy up to 
barrier (Figure 5.6c). A further increase in the positive applied potential will lead 
to almost maximum tilt of the energy landscape toward the right side, except for a 
particular potential at which Ps
 = 0 for an unstable state of polarization (Figure 5.6d) 
and as the polarization shifts in the positive region there is an increase in potential 
(Figure 5.6e). In the reverse of this process as the potential decreases the energy 
landscape is lifted up on the right side and as the applied potential approaches zero, 70 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
the energy landscape reach its most stable state in positive polarization due to re￾emergence of the energy barrier (Figure 5.6f).
Further, during complete switching, the atom takes some time. This time is an 
important parameter to express the positions of polarization; the polarization will 
increase with time (dPs
/dt’ ˃ 0) and at the same instant the applied voltage/field 
decreases with time (dEf
/dt’ ˂ 0). Therefore, in the transient NC case, the measure￾ment prospective can be achieved. To understand this, let’s consider a ferroelectric 
material with free charge (Q) per unit area on the electrode identical to the displace￾ment field, that can be mathematically written as
Q E P f s = + ε 0 (5.12)
Q estimates the total spontaneous polarization in the ferroelectric. Further, Q
varies as a function of time. Therefore, the equation can be represented in the form of 
a time derivative, as:
dQ

(5.13)
Since the rate of change of the electric field of a ferroelectric material is dependent 
on the rate of change of charge and the rate of change of spontaneous polarization, 
a change in the rate of the electric field defines the material behavior, i.e., it reflects 
stable or unstable states. Here, for any ferroelectric material, if the rate of change of 
spontaneous polarization is faster than the rate of change of charge Q, then the rate

capacitor system. The free energy-polarization landscape (b) at zero, (c) between zero and the

(f) at zero applied voltage.Anti-ferroelectric and Ferroelectric Materials 71
of change of the electric field will be negative, which leads to a negative capacitance 
transient situation in the ferroelectric material [8,41–43]. In other words, the rate of 
transient of electric field explains the switching mechanism and phases of the ferro￾electric materials at a microscopic level [41,43]. However, owing to instability in the 
negative capacitance region, a metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitor will always lead 
to positive capacitance in any circumstances. Therefore, there is a way to observe 
the negative capacitance effect/behavior of the ferroelectric material for different 
purposes. For that, the metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitor has to connect with second 
circuit elements such as the resistor, dielectric capacitor, or gate of the MOSFET that 
slow down the rate of change of charge Q and enable the decrease in the ferroelectric 
voltage with time, in series, to force the voltage across it [44–46]. However, recently 
Pintilie et al. observed negative capacitance behavior in the ferroelectric material by 
first increasing the applied voltage followed by a subsequent decrease in the applied 
voltage with ferroelectric switching [47].
5.3.2  Stabilized Negative Capacitance
Initially, it was agreed by the scientific community that it is almost impossible 
to observe negative capacitance behavior in a material with stability. However, 
Salahuddin and Datta suggested in 2008 that the ferroelectric negative capacitance 
state can be stabilized at zero spontaneous polarization by the addition of an add￾itional layer of material in a series that has positive capacitance [8]. It has also been 
found that the series connection between the metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitor 
and the metal-dielectric-metal capacitor leads to large leakage of current as well as 
the formation of domains that destabilize the negative capacitance behavior of the 
resultant system [48,49]. Further, when the ferroelectric and dielectric layers of the 
material are connected in series, i.e., deposited layer by layer, this leads to posi￾tive resultant total capacitance with no polarization hysteresis loop [8]. Therefore, 
for application purposes, the layer-by-layer deposition of ferroelectric and dielec￾tric is the preferred structure for negative capacitance behavior observation [50–55]. 
To understand the science behind this layer- by-layer preferred structure we have to 
understand the resultant Gibbs free energy of the total system. The Gibbs free energy 
of the dielectric material (Gd
) can be expressed as:
G D d E D
d
d = − 2
0 2ε ε
(5.14)
where D, εd
, and Ed
 are the displacement field, relative permittivity of the dielectric, 
and electric field in the dielectric material, respectively. Consider an approximation 
that D = Ps
, then the total free energy per unit area of the ferroelectric and dielec￾tric layer-by-layer structure sandwich between two metal plates or electrodes can be 
expressed with the help of Equations (5.9) and (5.14):

This illustrates that the thickness of the ferroelectric material with respect to the 
dielectric material plays an important role in the total stability of the negative cap￾acitance effect/behavior of the structured system. Further, relative permittivity of the 
dielectric material is one of the influencing factors for the stable negative capacitance 
behavior. To understand the complications, let’s consider two cases: first, suppose 
t
d
 ≤ t
f
, and second, t
d
 ≥ t
f
. There will be a critical thickness (t
cf) of the ferroelectric 
material corresponding to the dielectric material for which this system is completely 
stable. For the first case, the ferroelectric-dielectric layered system is placed between 
two electrodes as a parallel plate capacitor, as shown in Figure 5.7(a). Here, the free 
energy variation for different applied voltage ranges as a function of time represents 
various positions of the stable state of the structured system [Figures 5.7(b–g)]. 
As the applied voltage increases across the plates, the polarization states start to 
change their positions according to the resultant electric field inside the material. 
The increase in the applied voltage, which is function of the time, leads to the final 
free energy of the system shown below the free energy polarization graph. For the 
starting stage when the applied voltage is zero, the resultant free energy is negative 
owing to the prominent influence of the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization. This 
means that, in this case, free energy will be negative [Figure 5.7(b)]. As applied 
voltage increases between zero and the critical voltage, the free energy reaches zero 
or is slightly positive with negative polarization [Figure 5.7(c)]. However, at the 
critical/saturation applied voltage, the free energy again becomes negative with posi￾tive polarization [(Figure 5.7(d)] and above the critical voltage it becomes more 
negative [Figure 5.7(e)]. Further, as the applied voltage starts to decrease, the free 
energy again reaches zero or low positive, but this time with positive polarization 
[Figure 5.7(f)] and as it decreases the applied voltage further to zero, the free energy 
again becomes negative but with positive polarization [Figure 5.7(f)]. Therefore, 
in this case we can say that the current sandwich system behaves the same as a 
metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitor owing to the greater influence of spontaneous 
polarization of the ferroelectric material as compared to dielectric polarization. 
This happens due to the larger presence of ferroelectric atoms/molecules resulting 
from the depolarization field in the ferroelectric as compared to dielectric materials. 73 Anti-ferroelectric and Ferroelectric Materials FIGURE 5.7 Schematic diagram of stabilizing negative capacitance in a hybrid metal-dielectric-ferroelectric-metal capacitor configuration on the basis of free energy-polarization landscape.

Therefore, the negative capacitance behavior in this system is similar to transient 
negative capacitance (as discussed in Section 5.4.1).
Now, in the second case, where t
d
 ≥ t
f
 is considered for the ferroelectric dielectric 
layer-by-layer structured system fabrication, at the initial stage, i.e., when the applied 
voltage is zero, the free energy of the fabricated system is zero i.e., the negative 
capacitance state becomes stable in this system. This happens because the total free 
energy is minimized due to the addition of the maximum free energy of the ferroelec￾tric material and the minimum free energy of the dielectric material [Figure 5.7(i)]. 
In other words, we can say that in this situation the free energy and spontaneous 
polarization of the molecules/atoms present in the ferroelectric material are cancelled 
out by the constituent molecules/components of the dielectric material. This leads 
to a very stable negative capacitance effect/behavior. Further, as the positive applied 
voltages is increased, spontaneous polarization increases, but at the same instant, the 
electric field decreases owing to depolarization caused by the dielectric material, i.e., 
dPs
/dEf
 is negative, but the system remains stable due to resultant positive free energy 
[Figure 5.7(j)]. Therefore, total capacitance is always positive. As positive applied 
voltage increases further, to saturation polarization, the free energy of the fabricated 
system remains positive, resulting in a stable state with positive capacitance and 
maximum polarization conditions in the material [Figure 5.7(k)]. However, when 
the applied voltage increases more than the critical applied voltage, the ferroelectric 
material enters the positive capacitance state from a stable negative capacitance state 
[Figure 5.7(l)]. However, as the applied voltage decreases below critical voltage, the 
ferroelectric material again achieves a negative capacitance state with positive free 
energy, i.e., with stability [Figure 5.7(m)] and with a further decrease in the applied 
voltage to zero, the fabricated system again arrives at the initial situation where the free 
energy is minimum and zero or positive [Figure 5.7(n)]. The variation in the applied 
voltage as a function of time is grammatically represented below the corresponding 
free energy polarization plot of the fabricated system. There is an absence of negative 
free energy except above the critical applied voltage case, i.e., in the whole operating 
voltage range between zero to critical voltage, the fabricated system is stable with 
negative capacitance behavior without hysteresis. This fabricated system reflects the 
best fabrication system with negative capacitance behavior.
It is known that ferroelectric materials are made up of domains that contain their 
own polarization direction within the material. The size and orientation of these 
domains define the ferroelectric properties of the material. It contains a large number 
of atoms/molecules arranged in a set way. If these groups of atoms/molecules, i.e., 
domains of ferroelectric materials, change their polarization, then they need a large 
applied voltage to increase the resultant ferroelectric polarization and vice versa. 
These groups of atoms/molecules, i.e., domains, will also develop prominent depolar￾ization effects. In other words, these domains reduce the depolarization energy of the 
system.
This means that if we consider a ferroelectric material layer made up of domains 
over the dielectric layer in the layered structure, then the depolarization energy will 
reduce faster but in a discontinuous way. However, this type of hybrid ferroelectric￾dielectric layered system could emerge with a stable negative capacitance behavior/Anti-ferroelectric and Ferroelectric Materials 75
state [56]. Further, ferroelectric materials that have homogeneous polarization and 
that are in a combined layer with dielectric reflect stable and positive free energy, 
known as intrinsic negative capacitance (INC), while the ferroelectric materials with 
domains are known to have extrinsic negative capacitance (ENC).
In the simplest case of ferroelectrics with domains, the domains are arranged in the 
ferroelectric material in such a way that the alternative domains’ polarization is in the 
opposite direction [57]. Then, these domains are on the application of external elec￾tric fields (in the presence of an applied voltage. In addition, the domains oriented in 
the same direction as the electric fields, therefore start increasing their size, while the 
domains in the opposite direction to the electric field start reducing their size (because 
of the motion of the domain wall) [58]. This occurs due the special feature of materials 
that varies from material to material or due to the permittivity of the material and an 
excellent hybrid configurationally fabricated system with dielectrics that can reflect 
negative capacitance behavior [43,59,60]. In such cases, the thickness of the ferro￾electric layer plays an important role in the system fabricated with dielectric materials 
to stabilize the negative capacitance without hysteresis formation [41,42,61].
5.4 ORIGIN OF NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE IN 
ANTIFERROELECTRIC
The ferroelectric and antiferroelectric nature of a material depends on the 
domain’s polarization amplitude and direction. Kittel in his model predicted that 
antiferroelectric materials reflect two of the same hysteresis loops in the polarization–
electric field characteristic curve, as shown in the Figure 5.8(a). The stability of 
such a phenomenon can be explained from a thermodynamics prospective where 
the Gibbs free energy-polarization landscape shows the features. The characteristic 
curve reflects that as the electric field increases, polarization of the material also 
increases to point b, and then at this point it suddenly/sharply increases to point d 
without following the initial path of increment and reaches the saturation polariza￾tion of the material. However, as the electric field starts decreasing, the polariza￾tion follows the same path till point c and below this there is a slightly decrease in 
the electric field as a result of the sharp decrease in the net polarization, where it 
reaches point a, i.e., it does not follow the same path, so it reflects the hysteresis 
loop formation. Again, with a decrease in the electric field to zero, the net polar￾ization reaches zero. Further, with the application of a reverse electric field, the 
same polarization–electric field curve is obtained as with hysteresis loop formation. 
Moreover, at a zero electric field, the polarization inside the material will be zero 
which reflects a stable position at O, as shown in Figure 5.8(b). L and M reflect 
stable polarization corresponding to a particular electric field where small changes 
in the electric field did not significantly change the polarization with the same situ￾ation in a reverse electric field at points L’ and M’. These points reflect the stability 
position/state of the material as reflected in the free energy–polarization curve at 
Ef
 = E’ and Ef
 = –E’ in Figures 5.8(c,d).
If we divide the polarization region on the basis of the material response, it 
reflects three parts, the first is non-polar, the second is forbidden, and the third is 76 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
a polar region. In the non-polar region at Ef
 = 0 the material is in a ground state. 
With a further increase in the electric field to Ef
 = E in the non-polar region, polariza￾tion changes continuously with an electric field, whereas in the forbidden region, 
it changes abruptly, that reflects basically the negative capacitance behavior of the 
antiferroelectric material, where d2
G/dP2
 is less than zero. Moreover, the free energy 
of the polar and non-polar regions depends on the antiferroelectric material and 
strength of the applied electric field. Therefore, the polar state/region free energy 
could be lower as compared to the non-polar region, as a result of the negative capaci￾tance at the antiferroelectric transition in a stabilized microscopic system [6,8]. 
This type of stable microscopic system can be fabricated with a hybrid configuration 
of antiferroelectric materials with suitable dielectric materials where positive 
capacitance of the dielectric can reduce or minimize the effect of negative capacitance 
of the antiferroelectric [61–63]. This could result in negative capacitance in the 
FIGURE 5.8 Schematic representation of (a) a polarization-electric field plot of 
antiferroelectric material. b’ab corresponds to the region of non-polar antiferroelectric ground 
state, bd represent the forbidden region, and dc reflects the polar region of polarization

hybrid system with overall positive capacitance, i.e., with a stable system/structure 
for applications [8,64].
5.5 STOICHIOMETRIC CONFIGURATION ROLE IN NEGATIVE 
CAPACITANCE
The hybrid metal-dielectric-ferroelectric-metal capacitor system or metal￾dielectric-antiferroelectric-metal capacitor structured system is fabricated by unique 
techniques such as atomic layer deposition, pulsed layer deposition, etc., where 
layers of different thicknesses and configurations are deposited onto one another 
depending upon the requirement. This type of hybrid system can be generated by 
an ion implantation technique due to the targeted phase, and structural and stoi￾chiometric variations in the material up to the desired penetration depth. Doping of 
the desirable component during the fabrication process also reflects hybrid system 
fabrication [65]. In this way we can say that the negative capacitance behavior of 
the hybrid system not only depends on the thickness of the layer thickness but also 
their chemical composition.
Li et al., studied a MOSFET system with its ferroelectric component to observe 
the thickness effect on the negative capacitance behavior of a device, and observed 
that as the thickness of the ferroelectric layer is increased the subthreshold slope of 
the device decreases due to the negative capacitance feature of ferroelectric material 
in the device (Table 5.1), however, in order to minimize the size of the device one 
can’t keep increasing the thickness of the ferroelectric layer [66]. Therefore, FE 
thickness should be properly selected in order to achieve both current enhancement 
and saturated output characteristics.
Similarly, we know that temperature is the one of the most important factors in device 
life and performance. Xiao et al. reported a study of NCFETs as a function of tempera￾ture in a large temperature range of 280–360 K (Table 5.2) [67]. They claimed that as 
temperature increases the device power consumption increases, with poor performance 
of the transistor device. Therefore, according to their study, lower operating temperature 
gives better device performance as compared to higher operating temperatures.

5.6 CONCLUSION
The current CMOS technology cannot fulfill today’s global requirements owing 
to the non-scalability of threshold voltage due to immutable subthreshold swing 
(SS) leading to higher leakage current for low-power circuit operation. This has 
necessitated the search for novel low threshold voltage or steep-slope devices such 
as tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs) negative capacitance FETs (NC-FETs), 
positive feedback FETs, and impact ionization MOSFETs (IMOSs) that can replace 
or complement the existing CMOS technology. Negative capacitance is a newly 
discovered state of ferroelectric materials that enhances the electronic applica￾tion of ferroelectric materials along with high dielectric materials with appropriate 
hybrid structure configuration. This NCFET behavior/state could reduce the SS, 
size, and also power dissipation of devices. The physics and material engineering 
behind the NC state enable selection of the most suitable composition of ferroelec￾tric and dielectric materials, which is crucial for excellent and optimized perform￾ance. Antiferroelectric materials also exhibit negative capacitance behavior due to 
their hysteresis features. Their proper combination with dielectric material leads to 
stable negative capacitance behavior/state due to minimization of the free energy of 
the whole system. Negative free energy is countered by dielectric free energy at a 
particular polarization state or at a particular time of the voltage swing. In micro￾scopically designed structural devices, the roles of the concentration of parent and 
dopant molecules, domain size, domain wall movement, size of the layered struc￾ture, and applied voltage with time should be optimized to achieve the required per￾formance of negative capacitance behavior of the materials. The proposed devices 
have revealed excellent features that will reduce global issues with increased oper￾ating speed of devices.

6.1 INTRODUCTION
As the scaling of CMOS ICs progresses, power leakage/consumption is one of the 
important issues to address in ultra-low-power technology design. Although scaling 
power supply voltage is one of the effective ways to reduce dynamic power dissi￾pation, i.e., P V dynamic ∝ DD
2 , this comes at the cost of reducing the ON current of the 
device, which ultimately compromises the transistor speed. This results in the adjust￾ment of the threshold voltage to maintain the ON current i.e., I V V ON DD TH = − ( )α
, 
where α is between 1 and 2. However, lowering the threshold voltage increases the 
OFF current of the device, i.e., IOFF
V
SS TH
∝ − 10 , which again increases the device static 
power consumption, P I Static ∝ OFF . This contradictory requirement implies a trade-off 
between power and performance at lower technology nodes. However, lowering the 
device’s subthreshold swing (SS) may be one approach to alleviate this issue. The 
reduction in SS enables simultaneous scaling of VDD and VTH without sacrificing per￾formance or power dissipation. Moreover, the SS of a classical FET, on the other 
hand, cannot be decreased below the Boltzmann limit (60 mV/decade). The diffi￾culty in lowering SS [1] below the Boltzmann limit is a significant and long-standing 
problem. As a result, a worldwide search is underway for an ideal switch that can 
overcome Boltzmann tyranny and offer SS of less than 60 mV per decade. Over a 
decade, to overcome the fundamental Boltzmann limits and to achieve further scaling 
in a conventional CMOS technology, steep switches like tunnel-FET [2], phase￾FET [3], hybrid-FET [4-6], etc. have received a great deal of attention. The negative 
684 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
capacitance-based field effect transistor has attracted a lot of attention and popularity 
among the various steep switching devices. A lot of research also has been done in 
this area due to its CMOS compatibility and easiness of use in complex fabrications. 
To accomplish the SS < 60 mV/decade, NCFET utilizes the advantage of a differ￾ential negative capacitance effect that occurs in ferroelectric materials under some 
constraints. In this chapter, Section 6.3 places emphasis on the basic notion of nega￾tive capacitance’s physical origin, stability, and history in attaining steep switching 
benefits in FETs. The basic operating principle of an NCFET, and its various device 
architectures, namely MFMIS and MFIS used for low-power applications, will be 
discussed in Section 6.4. Unique NCFET device features, such as SS, NDIBL, and 
NDR, which can be useful in ultra-low power steep switching logics and memory 
applications, are discussed in Section 6.5. The various modeling techniques used for 
NCFETs are discussed in Section 6.6. The conclusion is in Section 6.7 and the future 
scope is described in Section 6.8 .
6.2 BASICS OF NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE MATERIALS
These are materials from the family of ferroelectric/antiferroelectric oxides that 
show negative capacitance properties (under some conditions) on the application of 
an electric field. Fundamentally, a device that has the capability of storing charge 
is defined as a capacitor. The capacitance Cis formulated as the rate of change of 
charge (Q) with respect to voltage (V ), i.e.,C d = Q d/ V. Capacitance can be positive 
or negative. If Qincreases as V increases it is defined as positive capacitance. On the 
other hand, if Qdecreases as V increases or Qincreases as V decreases it is termed 
negative capacitance. Capacitance can also be expressed as a function of energy U
(Equation 6.1). For linear capacitors, capacitance in terms of free energy is given by 
Equation 6.2.

A nonlinear capacitor also follows the same relationship. In the case of a positive 
capacitor, the energy landscape is a parabola, while an inverted parabola occurs for a 
negative capacitor, as shown in Figures 6.1(a) and (b). An insulating material’s energy 
landscape has a negative curvature zone that corresponds to a negative capacitance. 
Figure 6.1(c) depicts the ferroelectric material’s energy profile. There are two degen￾erate energy minima in it. This indicates that even without an applied electric field, the 
ferroelectric material could provide non-zero polarization. The net charge density can 
be defined as Q E P f = + ε , where ε is the ferroelectric’s linear permittivity, external 
electric field and polarization are denoted by E and P, respectively. Generally, P E 
in ferroelectric materials, resulting in Q P f ≈ . Comparing the ferroelectric energy 
profile [Figure 6.1(c)], it can be seen that the curvature of a ferroelectric around Q = 085 Optimized NCFET: Amplification Perspective FIGURE 6.1 Negative capacitor in (a) charge–voltage curve, (b) energy landscape, (c) ferroelectrics material energy profile with its negative capacitance region, and (d) its hysteresis charge–voltage/polarization-electric field loop with its S-curve showing negative capacitance region.
newgenrtpdf86 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
is exactly the same as that of a negative capacitor [Figure 6.1(b)]. This curvature 
suggests that the ferroelectric material has a negative capacitance near Q = 0. As a 
result, a ferroelectric substance could give a negative capacitance around this region. 
It can also be said that at E = 0 ferroelectric materials exhibit non-zero spontaneous 
polarization and behave as insulating materials having more than one discrete stable 
or metastable state. A ferroelectric material should switch between these states during 
E EC > , where EC is a coercive field. These changes in the energy states occur due to 
the field polarization coupling [Figure 6.1 (d)].
Joseph Valasek demonstrated the hysteresis characteristics of the polarization of

O, and its dependence on temperature in 1921, 
which established the polarization switching-ability factors for ferroelectrics and, in 
fact, the name ‘ferroelectricity.’ Then, various ferroelectric ceramic materials like 
inorganic BaTiO3
 [8] and perovskite (PbZrO3
, PbTiO3
) [9] were discovered during 
the 1950s to 1970s. However, the discovery of hafnium dioxide (HfO2
) as ferroelec￾tric paved the way for its use with the existing CMOS process. The compatibility of 
HfO2
 with silicon (Si), high coercive field, thickness scalability, and requiring thinner 
oxides (≈4 nm) to induce ferroelectricity are the key features for its uses in ultra-low￾power applications. To date, many doped HfO2
 compounds, for example, doped Sr 
[10], Al [11,12], La [13], Y [14,15], Gd [16], Zr [17–20], and Si [18,21–25] are used 
to induce ferroelectricity. Additionally, if HfO2
 is not doped and is deposited using 
chemical vapor deposition rather than physical vapor deposition, which is dielectric 
in nature, HfO2
 will exhibit ferroelectricity [26,27].
The non-centro-symmetry occurring in the ferroelectric oxides crystal is the 
reason behind ferroelectricity. This is necessary for the formation of electric dipoles, 
and consequently the vector quantity polarization. The off-centering ions create 
electric polarization or spontaneous dipole moments in the material and correspond 
to the two separate minimums of the ferroelectric energy landscape. Figure 6.1(d) 
depicts the energy curve for the corresponding hysteresis P-E loop of ferroelectric 
[28,29]. This hysteresis loop was well explained by Landau [30] in 1937. The theory 
of Landau explained the phenomenology model based on symmetry that acts as 
a conceptual link between microscopic models and observed macroscopic events. 
Landau emphasized in his writings that in a system smooth transition cannot happen 
between two phases with distinct symmetries. Because thermodynamically, states of 
two symmetry-wise different phases should be the same between their shared transi￾tion line, one symmetric phase must be greater than the other. Landau subsequently 
defined these transitions as an order parameter, a physical entry whose value is zero 
at high symmetry phase and gradually increases to a finite value at the low symmetry 
phase. This order parameter represents polarization in the case of a ferroelectric–
paraelectric transition, and the low and high symmetry phases correspond to the 
ferroelectric and paraelectric states. Only symmetry-compatible terms are kept when 
the free energy U is extended as a power series of the order parameter P. To acquire 
the spontaneous polarization P0
, the system’s state is determined by the minimal 
free energy U P( ) with regard to P. Experiments or first-principle calculations can 
be used to find the coefficients of the series expansion U P( ). The U P( )of a ferro￾electric is expressed in terms of the even-order polynomial of the polarization P, as 
given in Equation 6.3.Optimized NCFET: Amplification Perspective 87

The applied electric field is E V
d = , and the voltage across the ferroelectric and
 the ferroelectric thickness are V and d, respectively. The anisotropy constants are α , 
β , and γ , and β and γ are insensitive to temperature. γ is a positive quantity. For 
second-order and first-order phase transitions, β is positive and negative, respectively. 
α α= − ( ) 0 T TC , where α0
 is a positive and temperature-independent quantity. T and 
TC are defined as the temperature and Curie temperature. When α is below the Curie 
temperature this condition leads to the negative curvature in a ferroelectric’s energy￾landscape (at P = 0). In addition, this condition leads to the double-well energy curve. 
The application of an electric field tilts the energy profile by −EP, which results in 
a variation of the curve, as shown in Figure 6.1(d). For T < TC, Equations 6.2 and 
6.3 result in capacitance equations for P ⊕0 (Equation 6.4). Also, for dU
dP = 0, the 
electric field can be given by Equation 6.5 and P–V curves using this are shown in

It should be noted that the ferroelectric-based capacitor shows certain regions 
(dashed curve) where negative capacitance can be obtained due to nonlinear Q–V
characteristics. Landau theory is extensively used to study negative capacitance 
but due to the unstable nature of negative capacitance in ferroelectric experimental 
measurement, this was not possible during the early years. However, some groups 
[31,32] later showed a negative capacitance state in materials, providing experimental 
evidence of its use in low-power applications.
6.3 NCFET OVERVIEW
In order to replace or improve state-of-the-art transistors, negative capacitance-based 
FETs have attracted a lot of attention from several steep switching devices. In reality, 
understanding how NCFETs work begins with a simple SS equation (Equations 6.6, 
6.7) which is composed of various capacitances in the FET.

Insulating/oxide and channel surface region capacitance are denoted by CINS and 
CS
. The negative capacitance effect allows the ‘m’ factor (which was previously 88 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
assumed to be impossible by having a value lower than ‘1’) to be lower than ‘1’ in 
these equations. This would be the most distinguishing feature of NCFETs which 
allows SS to be lower than 60 mV/decade.
NCFET research came into the limelight when Salahuddin et al. [33] provided the 
concept of utilizing the negative capacitance property in ferroelectrics for achieving 
ultra-low-power and sub-60 mV/decade SS. They suggested that utilizing a hetero￾structure of ferroelectric and gate oxide in FET voltage amplification could be 
achieved, which helps in overcoming the fundamental limit (Boltzmann tyranny) 
in conventional FinFET/MOSFET. Later research has shown that in order to sta￾bilize the ferroelectric material’s inherent unstable negative capacitance, a ferroelec￾tric layer must be deposited on top of the gate oxide layer. Initially, they used PZT 
[Pb(Zrx
Ti1-x
)O3
] as the ferroelectric material. As discussed in Section 6.3, in terms of 
energy, ferroelectric materials have two polarized stable states. These states switch 
from one state to the other under an externally applied bias. When increasing applied 
bias reaches the coercive voltage/electric field in ferroelectric, its polarization state 
switches. This switching results in negative differential charge–voltage variations 
(dQ/dV < 0) and capacitance associated with it as negative capacitance. This results 
in the ferroelectric-gate oxide hetero-structure CINS being negative, which makes m < 
1 in the SS equation (Equation 6.5) and achieves SS < 60 mV/decade at 300 K, which 
is shown in the general transfer characteristics (Figure 6.2).
After introduction of the NCFET concept, a few trailblazing experiments were 
carried out to empirically determine the existence of negative capacitance [34,35]. Khan 
et al. used a simple RC circuit; where PZT with 60 nm thickness acts as a capacitor in 
series with a resistor to directly measure negative capacitance [28]. With the help of 
the observed voltage–time plot, they demonstrated a negative slope, which confirms 
the negative differential capacitance’s existence. In 2014, Appleby et al. and Zhao et al. 
FIGURE 6.2 NCFET transfer curve showing NCFET achieving a steep subthreshold swing 
compared with MOSFET.Optimized NCFET: Amplification Perspective 89
[36,37] experimentally verified that in a series-connected hetero-structure of SrTiO3
and BaTiO3
 capacitance increases with BaTiO3
 thickness, which confirms the role of 
BTO’s negative capacitance in overall capacitances. In the same year, Gao et al. [38] 
provided similar evidence of negative capacitance by using Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3
 + LaAlO3
hetero-structure. Similarly, Ku et al. [39] and Sharma et al. [43] have also confirmed 
the negative capacitance phenomenon in P(VDF0.75–TrFE0.25) and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2
 (HZO), 
respectively. Jo et al. performed a proof-of-concept work in 2015, demonstrating the 
sub-60-mV/dec. advantage of NCFETs by linking in series, the conventional MOSFET 
gate terminal and ferroelectric capacitor [40] and achieving a subthreshold slope of 
18 mV/decade at 300 K. In 2016, Khan et al. used the FinFET with a ferroelectric 
[BiFeO3
 (BFO)] gate stack to form NCFinFET. Many articles dealing with negative 
capacitance MOSFETs [41–46] and FinFETs [47–50] demonstrate the reproducible 
NC effect. Some recent works have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated 
the advantages of utilizing negative capacitance using state-of-the-art devices such as 
2-D FETs [51–54], nanoelectromechanical switches [55,56], carbon nanotubes [57], 
SOI devices [58], and polymer-ferroelectric FETs [59]. It is evident that for any logic 
application transistor’s threshold voltage should be equal during turning on and off in 
a device. However, the ferroelectrics employed in NCFETs have a unique ‘hysteresis’ 
property that prevents NCFETs from being used as logic transistors [60]. Therefore, 
obtaining a hysteresis-free operation capacitor matching in dielectric + ferroelectric 
hetero-structure is required. Ferroelectric thickness optimization is done to achieve 
hysteresis-free operation but this increases the SS of the transistor [41,50,61]. 
Therefore, the trade-off between the SS and hysteresis window is important to achieve 
performance benefits in NCFETs. Ferroelectric materials like PVDF, BaTiO3
, PZT, 
etc. were used initially for NCFET design [38–40,62]. However, apart from having 
benefits such as being simple to fabricate, these materials are too thick (greater than 
10 nm) for outstanding ferroelectric characteristics, making them incompatible with 
lower technology nodes, and there are also drawbacks in lead use restrictions as well 
as being incompatible with existing CMOS processes which restrict their uses. Later, 
hafnium-based doped or undoped ferroelectric materials were developed to address 
technical difficulties. Lee et al. reported that the HfZrOx
 ferroelectric layer with a 
thickness of 1 nm could be used to validate the steep switching characteristic of 
NCFETs [63]. Also, for lower technology nodes, transistors’ HfO2
 thickness can reach 
< 1 nm. Further research has revealed that HfO2
 can increase NCFET CMOS compati￾bility [64,65]. Issues such as traps, leakage, and domain formation [66–69] in hafnium 
oxide-based ferroelectric layers need to be addressed for proper NCFET device oper￾ation. In a nutshell, diverse studies have been done in explaining the negative capaci￾tance phenomenon for steep-switching applications. Controlling hysteresis in NCFET, 
CMOS-compatible ferroelectric oxides, capacitor matching of ferroelectric and dielec￾tric for stable operations, and proper compact modeling of NCFET are needed before 
moving to commercialization.
6.4 NCFET BASIC OPERATION
The baseline FET’s gate stack is sandwiched with ferroelectric material to form the 
NCFET structure. The baseline FET could be a MOSFET or a FinFET, dependent 90 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
on the application. Ferroelectric materials exhibit negative capacitance properties 
under specific conditions, which improve overall transistor performance. As shown 
in Figure 6.3, in the literature there are two types of NCFET device structures studied, 
namely metal ferroelectric metal insulator-semiconductor (M-F-M-I-S) and metal 
ferroelectric insulator semiconductor (M-F-I-S) [70]. In the case of the M-F-M-I￾S structure [71,72], the internal metal layer divides the ferroelectric capacitor and 
the baseline MOSFET/FinFET into two separate circuit elements connected through 
the wire and is simulated using a lumped modeling approach by solving the self￾consistent Landau-Devonshire (L-D) model of ferroelectric with the MOSFET/
FinFET physics. However in the M-F-I-S [73] NCFET structure, the ferroelectric–
oxide interface internal voltage varies from source to drain in a longitudinal direc￾tion for non-zero drain bias. Therefore, either the full analytical approach, distributed 
modeling approach, or segmentation approach [74–76] is used for evaluating the 
channel current. Compared to the M-F-I-S device structure, the M-F-M-I-S struc￾ture may offer a higher ON current and make the device less susceptible to hyster￾esis. Numerous studies [69,77] have suggested that the internal metal gate, however, 
destabilizes the negative capacitance state because of ferroelectric leakage current 
and domain formation. The internal metal gate of NCFETs also serves as an add￾itional point of traps, which affects the reliability of NCFETs [77–80].
It can be mathematically deduced that SS can be divided into two parts, namely 
transport factor (q) and body factor (p), and is shown by Equations 6.8 and 6.9, 
which assists in explicating the advantages of NC integration in reducing SS. NCFET 
attains an SS of 60 mV/decade by lowering the body factor in the manner described 
in Equations 6.10 and 6.11, which further divides the body factor into the inverse of 
the voltage amplification factor (AG) multiplied by m. In a conventional FET, factor 
‘p’ is often larger than 1 for positively connected series gate oxide capacitance, and 
FIGURE 6.3 NCFET device structure: (a) M-F-M-I-S and (b) M-F-I-S.Optimized NCFET: Amplification Perspective 91
q is constrained by the thermionic limit of 2.3 KBT/q, or 60 mV/decade. However, in 
NCFET, the total series capacitance formed by the ferroelectric capacitance (CFE) and 
total internal FET capacitance (CINT) increase, which causes voltage amplification in 
the VG’S (Figure 6.4). This happens due to the negative value of CFE which increases 
AG to greater than 1, although m is always unity. When compared to conventional 
FET, the performance of NCFET is improved by this voltage amplification in terms 
of reducing SS to below the Boltzmann limit and increasing the ON current for the 
identical applied voltage. This is because the combined term AG * m > 1 results in a 
reduction of term p to < 1, which in turn lowers the overall SS.

According to Reference [33], NC instability can be stabilized by connecting a 
positive dielectric capacitance to the ferroelectric in series, making the capacitance 
of the entire system positive. A baseline FET’s internal gate has positive capacitance 
(CINT ) in the context of an NCFET and is connected in series with the ferroelectric 
material’s capacitance. This makes the total gate capacitance (1 1 1 / C C INT FE
− − ( ) + ) 
positive and stabilizes the unstable NC. The condition C C FE INT > should follow for 
capacitor matching. Also, it is evident from Figure 6.4 that CFE and CINT are dependent 
FIGURE 6.4 NCFET general circuit equivalent: (a) capacitance model and (b) schematic.92 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
on drain, gate, and body voltages (VD, VG, VB). Violation of the aforementioned condi￾tion causes the electrical properties of the device to behave in a hysteresis manner for 
any combination of VG and VD [81]. Because CFE varies in an inverse proportion with 
TFE, it is necessary to control TFE in order to avoid these conflicts. The remnant polar￾ization (Pr
) and coercive field (Ec
) of the ferroelectric material also affect CFE . The 
CFE value is increased by ferroelectric materials with high Pr
 and low Ec
 values [82]. 
This is required to maintain a hysteresis-free condition (|CFE| > CINT) within the range 
of applied operating voltages. Also, if CINT and CFE are not matched properly due 
to selecting low TFE, high Pr
, and low EC, the gain due to ferroelectric decreases, as 
shown in Equation 6.11. Therefore, in order to achieve higher NC gain while avoiding 
hysteresis, which is undesirable for logic applications, critical values of Ec
, Pr
, and TFE
must be carefully chosen. Awadhiya et al. [83–87] have shown mathematically that 
for any general NCFET [Figure 6.4(b)], the effects due to drain (D) and gate (G) in 
the internal gate (G’) are needed. Using the superposition theorem to solve the capaci￾tive model shown in Figure 6.4(a) we get Equations 6.12–6.15 where AD is defined 
as a drain coupling factor, AG is the differential gain or amplification factor, and AB is 
the bulk coupling factor for any NCFET device and is given by:

These equations describe the general mathematical formulations to show the

6.5 NCFET FEATURES
Apart from reducing SS to below 60 mV/decade, NCFET has some other features 
which could be a benefit for low-power applications and these have been discussed in 
many works. Ferroelectric thickness (TFE), EC, and Pr
 are critical parameters for any 
NCFET. Optimization of these parameters for a particular technology is required to 
obtain hysteresis-free NCFET or hysteretic FEFET which then can be utilized for ultra￾low-power logic, analog, and memory applications. To date, it has been discussed in 
various articles [81,82] that due to the voltage amplification effect of negative capaci￾tance, NCFETs show improved ON current and decreased OFF current as compared 
to conventional FETs, which makes them a better choice of device for ultra-low-power Optimized NCFET: Amplification Perspective 93
applications. The general transfer characteristics of the n-type NCFETs with 
different ferroelectric thicknesses (TFE) are shown in Figure 6.5(a). It can be seen 
that NCFET has a greater I
I ON
OFF
 ratio compared to the conventional FET. With 
rising TFE, these benefits become more obvious. Moreover, hysteresis in the output 
characteristics seems to occur at TFE = 6 nm. This is because of an imbalance between 
the internal total baseline FET capacitance and ferroelectric capacitance (discussed 
in Section 6.5), which should be avoided if such an NCFET device is to be used 
for logic applications [60,92]. As shown in Figure 6.5(a), the drain-induced bar￾rier lowering (DIBL) factor in NCFET is negative, hence the threshold voltage 
rises as the drain bias is enhanced, which has been verified by various literature 
works [88–90]. The opposite of how FET works where threshold voltage reduces 
with increasing drain bias, NCFET’s barrier height rises as the drain voltage 
rises, translating into an increase in threshold voltage and resulting in a negative 
DIBL factor, and this phenomenon is termed DIBR (drain-induced barrier rising) 
or negative DIBL. Furthermore, gate-induced drain lowering (GIDL) increases 
with increasing TFE [93,94]. Also, in the output characteristics [Figure 6.5(b)] of 
NCFET with increasing TFE it can be seen that negative differential resistance 
(NDR) occurs where the ON current decreases with an increment in the drain 
to source voltage. This feature also has been verified by various research groups 
[81,89,91].
6.6 MODELING APPROACHES: NCFET
To evaluate the NCFET’s unique features for low-power applications including 
devices, circuits, systems, etc. lots of compact, analytical modeling approaches and 
the TCAD model have been proposed and used [71,95–100]. This section discusses 
two of them, i.e., the Landau-Khalatnikov (L-K)/Landau-Devonshire (L-D) model for 
FIGURE 6.5 (a) NCFET general transfer characteristics showing negative DIBL, GIDL, 
incremented ON current, and decremented OFF current, and (b) output characteristics showing 
enhanced ON current and NDR with varying TFE in 14 nm FinFET technology.94 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
ferroelectrics and the Prieasch model of ferroelectrics. In the L-K compact modeling 
approach, the single domain time-dependent L-K/L-D model of ferroelectric given 
by Equation 6.16 is coupled with the industry standard FinFET/MOSFET model 
(BSIM model) [101]. In Equation 6.16 α , b, and γ are materials with specific Landau 
coefficients and the kinetic coefficient r relates with the time constant associated with 
ferroelectric polarization change.

The gate charge (QG) is first retrieved from the calibrated BSIM model in the 
self-consistent strategy. Then, the QG value is applied to the parameter QG in the 
Verilog-A written L-K equation (Equation 6.16). The internal metal voltage given 
by VG’S = VGS – VFE is the outcome of the L-K model. This modeling strategy relies 
on a set of assumptions, such as taking the ferroelectric mono-domain formation 
into account, assuming polarization P = QG – εo
* VFE/TFE ≈ QG. Initially, the primary 
issue with the L-K theory of ferroelectric phase transition model is that the S-shaped 
P–E curve lacks experimental validation. However, later, presented techniques [102] 
for detecting steady-state negative capacitance and S-curves that were validated by 
experiment, gave credence to the use of the L-K modeling approach. Contrary to 
other techniques, this model can capture all of the distinctive characteristics of the 
NCFET despite its clear and simple methodology [103]. The experimental findings of 
NCFETs with ferroelectric thicknesses as small as 1.5 nm and 3 nm [63] could also 
be replicated by the L-K model. Additionally, the NC effect on its own has no add￾itional delay penalty [104]. In contrast to L-K model, the Preisach model [105,106] 
is based on an integration of the baseline FET model with the multi-domain Preisach 
theory for ferroelectric. Initially, the L-K model was used, this has some limitations 
of not capturing hysteresis properly and assuming mono-domain in ferroelectrics, 
while some groups have recently shown that the Prieasch model of negative capaci￾tance includes more accurate modeling of hysteresis by capturing the multi-domain 
effect [107,108] in ferroelectric for NCFET, specially FEFET. Both of these mod￾eling approaches are acceptable and have been able to provide experimental evidence 
of NCFET. The L-K model is generally used for logic applications, while the Prieasch 
model is used for memory applications.
6.7 CONCLUSION
Considering the pressing need for a new low-power switch, NCFET research after its 
conceptual proposal by Salahuddin et al. is legitimately deserving of the extensive 
coverage and in-depth analysis it has received from the device physics community 
over the past ten years.
This chapter summarizes the basics of NCFET, starting from the initial concept to 
the recent modifications and its matures current status. The utilization of ferroelectric 
with the gate stack of conventional FET to achieve sub-60 mV/decade is the pri￾mary focus of this fast Landau switch for low-power electronics. Moreover, NCFET Optimized NCFET: Amplification Perspective 95
achieves this by reducing the threshold voltage, increasing ON-to-OFF current ratio, 
being hysteresis-free, and achieving supply voltage scaling. However, this comes at 
the cost of increased total gate capacitance and an added barrier at the drain side due 
to a decrement in the internal gate voltage at higher drain voltage. At high ferroelectric 
thickness and low gate-to-source voltage, NDR is seen in the NCFET, which can be 
useful for analog applications. Internal voltage amplification not only reduces SS but 
also shows NDIBL with suppressed short channel effect, contrary to the MOSFET. 
The discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO2
 doped/undoped CMOS-compatible material 
provides additional interest to the NCFET concept towards commercialization and 
avoids the problem of ultra scaling in conventional ferroelectric devices for below 
5 nm. Optimizations of ferroelectric thickness, coercive field, and polarization are 
the key parameters to achieve performance benefits in NCFET. Research efforts have 
been aimed at various device structure configurations, namely MFMIS and MFIS. 
MFIS NCFET device structure provides additional practical benefits compared with 
MFMIS. Many compact, TCAD, analytical models have been developed using L-K 
theory and have been able to explain various experimental phenomena of multidomain 
switching and hysteresis in NCFET. Quasi-static NCFET is well explained using the 
L-K model, while the Prieasch model is able to explain FEFET.
6.8 FUTURE SCOPE
Lots of works have been published on NCFET conceptual models but there remain 
some research gaps which need to be filled before moving to commercializa￾tion. The prime focus of NCFET relies on the reduction of SS, which creates a 
confusing scenario in this field. The frequency response of NCFET needs to be 
addressed in the future to validate its limit and speed of operations. Studying the 
reliability of NCFET devices includes threshold voltage and charge accumulation 
stability, ferroelectric-dielectric heterostructure, and breakdown strength. Also, 
the aggressive scaling below 5 nm node occurs recently and in the future to pro￾vide extremely thin ferroelectric dimensions is itself a challenge while maintaining 
proper device operation. Proper validation of various physics models and theories 
for quasi-static NC remains unresolved and debatable. It is too early to use HfO2
-
based ferroelectric, with a lot of research needed to ensure its compatibility, reli￾ability, domain dynamics, etc.

7.1 INTRODUCTION
With advances in fabrication technology, complementary metal oxide semiconductor 
(CMOS) technology has undergone dramatic downscaling over the past five decades, 
as a result of which the performance of integrated circuits (ICs) has steadily improved 
following Moore’s law [1,2]. As a consequence of this law, CMOS transistors 
became smaller, but their power consumption increased due to the scaling of phys￾ical features, while the amount of leakage currents due to quantum tunneling also 
increased [3]. Furthermore, the memory devices based on CMOS technology require 
a high amount of power in order to maintain their non-volatility property [4–6]. As 
a result, researchers are seeking an alternative to CMOS technology, leading to the 
development of new technologies [7–9].
Spintronics, also referred to as magnetoelectronics, is considered to be one of the 
most promising future technologies. Spintronic devices make use of the spinning of 
an electron along with its fundamental electronic charge [10,11]. Elementary particles 
such as electrons, neutrons, protons, neutrinos, and neutrinos possess an inherent spin 
property [12]. The two important characteristics of an electron, that is spin orienta￾tion and its magnetic moment, are used as state variables, which have the potential to 
solve many of the problems of charge-based electronic devices [13]. Spintronic tech￾nology retaining spin and magnetization of an electron are very unlike conventional 
CMOS technology where stored charge is lost due to leakage current [14,15].
Static random-access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory 
(DRAM) are used for data storage. Table 7.1 shows a comparison of the perform￾ance parameters of various memory storage devices. However, SRAM and DRAM 
memory devices suffer certain limitations which include high power dissipation 
and high leakage current, depreciation of stored charge, and also require regular 
refreshing circuits [16,17]. These problems can be overcome with spintronic￾based magnetic random access memory (MRAM), such as spin transfer torque 
(STT) MRAM and spin–orbit torque (SOT) MRAM, due to their high endurance, 
 7104 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
non-volatile nature, and fast read/write speeds. In the fast-growing fields of big 
data, artificial intelligence, and information and communication technology (ICT), 
spintronic devices can have a huge impact [18–20]. This chapter focuses on the 
spintronic-based magnetic devices and their applications in memory technology.
7.2 SPINTRONIC DEVICES
Figure 7.1 shows the key historical developments in spintronics-based research. 
The concept of electron spin was proposed in 1925 [21], many years before the first 
integrated circuit was introduced in 1958 [22,23].
However, because of technological constraints and a lack of understanding, it 
was not widely used until the discovery of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in 1988 
[24,25]. GMR is regarded as one of the physical breakthroughs that led to the devel￾opment of spintronics.
The giant magnetoresistance (MGR) effect is the change in electrical resistance 
of magnetic material upon the application of an external magnetic field [26]. Another 
milestone in the field of spintronics was the proposal for a spin transistor by Datta 
and Das in 1990 [27], also known as an electro-optic modulator. However, the spin 
transistor sparked the development of a wide range of spintronic-based future tech￾nologies and concepts. Figure 7.2 illustrates the major classifications of spintronic 
devices. Among them, spin valve, MTJ, domain wall nanowire, all spin logic devices, 
and skyrmions are the most promising ones due to their high performance and future 
scope [26].
7.3 SPIN VALVE
In general, a spin valve is a sample made up of a GMR trilayer which includes two 
ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-ferromagnetic layer. Of the two ferromag￾netic layers, one is magnetically soft and is very sensitive to small applied magnetic 
fields, whereas the other layer is magnetically hard [28]. One of the ferromagnetic 
layers has a fixed magnetic orientation called a pinned layer, while the other layer 
can either have a parallel or antiparallel magnetic orientation called a free layer (FL).

newgenrtpdf106 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
During the giant magnetoresistance effect, the ferromagnetic layers react with the 
applied magnetic field to change their magnetization relative to each other, as a result 
the electric conductivity changes. The spin valve is based upon the fact that the spin 
state of carriers (electrons) align either ‘up’ or ‘down’ in ferromagnetic materials 
upon the application of an external magnetic field [29,30]. A spin valve can be under￾stood by considering the scattering of spin-polarized electrons [31].
Figure 7.3 shows the conduction principle in the spin valve. In ferromagnetic 
material, the densities of states available for spin-up and spin-down electrons are 
unequal, while in the case of non-ferromagnetic material the densities of states for 
spin-up and spin-down electrons are equal. The electrons whose spin is aligned 
in the same direction as magnetic orientation of the ferromagnetic material layer 
are called the majority electrons, whereas those electrons whose spin is aligned in 
the opposite direction as magnetic orientation of the FM layer are called minority 
electrons [32]. The spin valve has relatively low electrical resistance in a par￾allel configuration, where majority electrons (spin-up) flow freely through NFM, 
compared to minority electrons (spin-down). On the other hand, when the spin 
valve is in antiparallel configuration, the arrangement of density of states causes 
scattering of both spin-up as well as spin-down electrons, resulting in relatively 
high resistance of the device [33].
The equation for GMR is given as:
GMR = ∆R
Rp
(7.1)
where △R represents the difference of electrical resistance between parallel and anti￾parallel configurations of spin arrangements, and Rp
 denotes the resistance value of 
FIGURE 7.2 Major classifications of spintronic devices.Spin-based Magnetic Devices with Spintronics 107
the GMR device in parallel configuration. The GMR effect has been utilized in several 
applications such as GMR sensors, biological applications, and space applications [34].
7.4 MAGNETIC TUNNEL JUNCTION
Figure 7.4 shows the basic structure of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). It consists 
of two ferromagnetic active layers called the pinned (fixed) and free (storage) layers 
separated by an intermediate thin insulating oxide or tunnel layer [35].
Depending upon the magnetic orientation of ferromagnetic layers, MTJ is of two 
types: (i) in-plane MTJ (i-MTJ) and (ii) perpendicular-plane MTJ (p-MTJ). i-MTJ 
occurs when the magnetic orientation of the FM layers (pinned and fixed layers) 
is in the plane of the MTJ. On the other hand, if the magnetic orientation of the 
FM layer is perpendicular to the MTJ plane, then it is p-MTJ [36–38]. Figure 7.5
illustrates the low resistance state (RP
) and high resistance state (RAP) of (a) i-MTJ 
and (b) p-MTJ.
FIGURE 7.4 Schematic illustration of the MRAM device.
FIGURE 7.3 The conduction principle in the spin valve.108 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
The magnetization of the pinned layer (PL) is fixed and varied for the free (FL) or 
storage layer [39]. Upon applying an external electric field to the MRAM device, the 
magnitude of the current passing through the tunneling layer depends on the relative 
direction (parallel or antiparallel) of magnetization [40]. In the parallel state (P), the 
resistance offered by the device for the flow of current is reduced, because the mag￾netic orientation of the free layer (FL) and pinned layer (PL) is in same direction. If, 
on the other hand, the magnetic orientation of FL is in the opposite direction to the 
magnetic orientation of the PL, then the device offers a higher resistance to the flow 
of current, which is indicative of its antiparallel (AP) state [41,42].
The resistance of antiparallel or parallel states decides the logic ‘0’ or high resist￾ance state (HRS) and the logic ‘1’ or low resistance state (LRS) of the device [43]. In 
the case of MTJ, due to the presence of an insulating layer, the tunnel magnetoresist￾ance (TMR) effect is observed. The TMR ratio is an important parameter for MTJ and 
is given as follows [22]:
Tunnel magnetoresistance(TMR) = R R
R
AP P
P
−
where RP
 and RAP denote the value of resistance in parallel and anti-parallel configur￾ation in MTJ, respectively. Therefore, MTJ can be considered a two-valued resistor, 
which is very significant in memory and logical applications. MTJ is assumed to have 
stored bits ‘1’ and ‘0’ when it is in P and AP configurations, respectively, and the 
stored data values are nonvolatile [40].
7.5 MAGNETIC TUNNEL JUNCTION (MTJ) WRITING TECHNIQUES
The writing process is also known as switching or storing the data in MTJ from par￾allel to anti-parallel configuration or vice versa and can be achieved by switching the 
FIGURE 7.5 The low resistance state (RP
) and high resistance state (RAP) of: (a) in-plane MTJ 
(i-MTJ) and (b) perpendicular-plane MTJ (p-MTJ).Spin-based Magnetic Devices with Spintronics 109
magnetic orientation of the fixed layer (FL). The various mechanisms used for MTJ 
writing process are discussed below.
7.6 FIELD-INDUCED MAGNETIC SWITCHING (FIMS)
Field-induced magnetic switching (FIMS) is the first-generation MRAM write tech￾nique that uses an external magnetic field to change the magnetic orientation of fixed 
layer in MTJs [44]. A current is passed through orthogonal write lines (also called bit 
and digit lines) to generate the magnetic field, as shown in Figure 7.6.
As orthogonal currents flow in bit lines and digit lines, respectively, they produce 
hard-axis and easy-axis switching fields, which turn on the MTJs. Depending on the 
flow of the current direction, parallel (P) and anti-parallel (AP) configurations are 
switched. Despite its advantages during sensing, this writing technique has a number 
of disadvantages, such as low density, high power consumption, and limited scal￾ability [44].
The current needed to produce a magnetic field for MTJ writing is high (≳10mA), 
as a result the power consumption increases. Furthermore, the electromigration effect 
limits scalability, which makes it difficult to reach low densities. MTJs are arranged 
in an array in which the magnetic orientation of FL is toggled by the external field 
generated. This results in erroneous switching of other neighboring MTJs in that 
array. To alleviate this problem, a novel toggle switching mode was proposed by 
Freescale. Based on this writing technique, they launched the first commercial 4 Mb 
MRAM product [45]. Though the toggle switching approach addressed the concern 
of the half-selectivity problem, it did not resolve the issue of high power consump￾tion, low density, and limited scalability.
7.7 THERMAL-ASSISTED SWITCHING (TAS)
Thermal-assisted switching (TAS) is an upgraded writing technique compared to 
field-induced magnetic switching (FIMS) [46]. Figure 7.7 shows the writing process 
FIGURE 7.6 The writing process in field-induced magnetic switching (FIMS).110 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
in TAS. In the case of TAS, a heating current is passed through the MTJ to be written, 
which lowers the magnetic field strength during writing. Hence the generation of 
magnetic fields can be achieved by a single current line and as a result the writing 
energy and circuit area are reduced significantly. As a result of its power savings, 
higher density, and higher thermal stability, TAS is utilized in MRAM [47,48] and 
look-up tables (LUTs) [49]. TAS, however, has been limited in its application to high￾speed logic applications due to the requirement for a relatively longer cooling dur￾ation after being switched.
7.8 CONCLUSION
An overview of spintronic devices, which are expected to become a mainstream tech￾nology in the future, is presented in this chapter. This chapter particularly focused on 
different types of spin-valve devices and their working principles, along with different 
conventional and recently developed types of MTJ devices. The most important 
characteristics of the spintronic devices, such as GMR and TMR effects, were discussed. 
The various writing techniques adapted for MTJs such as FIMS and TAS, and their 
switching dynamics, were outlined. Among the different types of spintronic devices, 
MRAM-based memory devices are dominant and play an important in memory tech￾nology. Several spintronic companies have succeeded in commercializing embedded 
MRAM memory products. In addition to memory applications, spintronics are also 
expected to be used in the recently buzzed-about PIM paradigm of normally-off/instant￾on on computer architecture. The CMOS technology is currently being integrated with 
spintronic devices using CAD tools such as Cadence in order to develop applications 
for memory and hybrid circuits. However, the simulation models and prototypes differ 
substantially. Moreover, in order to increase the speed and lower the threshold current 
at which data bits can be manipulated, artificially engineered thin-film structures are 
needed. The field of spintronics is still in its infancy and requires much more research, 
both academically and industrially, in order to fill this void. The aim is to develop 
low-power, high-speed, high-density circuits by integrating microelectronics with new 
materials, fabrication methods, and new computer architectures.

8.1 INTRODUCTION
Conventional MOS transistors: The progress of the very large-scale integration 
(VLSI) world has been possible with continuous scaling of silicon-based metal–
oxide–semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). This device has been con￾stantly scaled down in pursuit of lower power consumption, enhanced performance, 
smaller area, and lower cost. Aggressive scaling is a cause of various limitations 
and challenges in classical MOSFET. However, it has been expected that the down￾scaling will reach its limits about a gate length (LG) of 5 nm [1–4]. Leakage current 
is one of the most important causes of the scaling limitation of classical Si-based 
MOSFET. The leakage current (ILeakage) available in conventional MOS devices is 
one of the most challenging factors; especially for low-power energy (LPE)-based 
applications. Especially, existing leakage current components are a major road 
blocker in the path of ultra-low-power (ULP) circuit and system developments. 
Ultra-low-voltage operation of CMOS circuits significantly reduces the circuits’ 
power consumption. Recently, reducing energy consumption has been the most 
common practice worldwide. For the purpose of intelligently lowering power con￾sumption of electronic equipment, semiconductor devices, including CMOS LSIs, 
clearly need to enhance their power efficiency significantly. In order to efficiently 
lower the power consumption of CMOS circuits, lowering the supply voltage (Vdd) 
is most effective. Figure 8.1 shows the ITRS prediction for the possible develop￾ment and scaling trend. In Figure 8.1, there are three sub-windows showing the 
trends of (a) speed, (b) energy, and (c) gate length in HP devices in the past (lEDM) 
and future (2011 ITRS). Lowering the gate length indicates continuous scaling of 
MOSFETs.
Subthreshold swing in semiconductors is a crucial parameter, primarily 
observed in metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and 
similar transistor devices. It represents the energy efficiency required for the tran￾sistor to transition between the ON and OFF states by controlling the applied 
voltage.
Subthreshold swing plays a significant role in devices and sources that consume 
low power or operate on limited resources like batteries. A smaller subthreshold 
swing enables transistors to operate more efficiently, consuming less power even 
with small input signals. This advancement contributes to the progress of semicon￾ductor technology, leading to improved performance in low-power applications such 
as mobile devices.
Nevertheless, improving subthreshold swing is not an easy task due to various 
physical limitations arising from existing device structures and materials. To address 
this challenge, extensive research and development into novel transistor designs and 
materials are required in the semiconductor industry. These efforts hold the promise 
of enhancing power efficiency and overall performance in semiconductor devices.
This steady and consistent reduction, however, has been extremely difficult for 
conventional bulk CMOS because of increasing variability and decreasing voltage 
margin between Vdd and threshold voltage (Vth) [5]. Figure 8.1(d) shows that the 
inverse subthreshold slope (SS) has an increasing trend with scaling in FinFET. 
Therefore, increasing behavior of SS suggests that short-channel effects (SCEs) will 116 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
be more prominent at the lower contracted-gate-pitch. As shown in Figure 8.1(d), 
for sub-20 nm channel lengths, DIBL increases; therefore, the FinFET devices are 
approaching the short-channel regime.
The basic requirements of circuit and system design are formulated as ‘figure of 
merit’ (FoM) [6]:
Figureof Merit Intelligence
Size Cost Power = ( ) ( )×( )×( )
The theoretical measurement greatly depends on scaling of the existing FET 
devices. The bulk MOSFETs have played a lead role in the development of VLSI 
circuits and systems in the form of integrated circuits (ICs). Existing various SOCs 
FIGURE 8.1 The trends of (a) speed, (b) energy, (c) gate length in HP devices in the past 
(IEDM) and future (2011 ITRS), and (d) gate length.Mathematical Approach for a Future Semiconductor Roadmap 117
(system on chips) are examples of such types of development. Reduction of power in 
modern technology directly realizes an improvement in the device and circuit as well 
as the system based on MOS devices. However, the power factor is mainly affected 
by existing leakage power. In conventional MOSFET, there are various components 
of leakage, as shown in Figure 8.2. The existing leakages in MOSFET include: (1) 
the reverse-bias PN junction leakage denoted as (I1
), (2): subthreshold leakage (I2
), 
(3) the oxide tunneling current (I3
), (4) the gate current due to hot-carrier injection 
(I4
), (5) the GIDL (I5
), and (6) the channel punch through current (I6
). The leakage 
current components (2), (5), and (6) are off-state leakage mechanisms, while (1) and 
(3) occur in both ON and OFF states, and (4) occurs in the off state [6].
In Equations (8.1) and (8.2) the used terms, Vth, VT
, COX, µ0
, ή, TD, CD, and TOX are 
the threshold voltage, thermal voltage, gate oxide capacitance, zero bias mobility, 
body effect coefficient, maximum depletion layer width, depletion layer capacitance,
and thickness of the gate oxide, respectively.

A generalized sketch diagram for leakage current in conventional MOS devices 
is shown in Figure 8.3 Another, more important low-power (LP) device and circuit 
design parameter in the subthreshold region is the inverse-subthreshold slope (SS), 
which indicates the speed of turning off the transistor below the threshold voltage and 
is given by Equation (8.3) [7–13]. The used variable in SS for conventional MOSFET 
has a common meaning like k, Boltzmann constant, having a value = 1.381E-23 J•K–
1. T is temperature in Kelvin. The elementary charge is denoted by q which has a 
numerical value of 1.602176634×10−19 coulombs.
The mathematical expression of the subthreshold leakage current is as follows

The SS defined for conventional MOS devices is defined by Equation (8.3), which 
is the change in gate voltage (VGS) needed to increase the drain current (IDS) by 
one order of magnitude. Measured in units of millivolts per decade, in conventional 
MOSFETs it is limited to kT/q by the Boltzmann electron energy distribution [6–12]. 
The numerical value of Boltzmann electron energy at room temperature (T = 300K) is 
26 mV. At room temperature, the numerical value of SS is 60 mV/decade. The lower 
the value of SS, the better is the MOS device. As suggested by the expression, the 
lower value can be obtained by (a) reducing temperature T, (b) higher Cox or a thinner 
oxide layer, and (c) lower Cdm or a thicker depletion layer or lower substrate doping 
[13–19].
8.2 POWER FACTOR WITH SCALED MOS TRANSISTORS 
OPPORTUNITY
The power dissipation of the CMOS circuit and system is roughly measured by 
Equation (8.4), having two components, dynamic power and static power. The 
dynamic power is measure by mathematical relation (8.5) and has strong dependency 
of power supply VDD. In the case of conventional CMOS VLSI circuits and systems, 
lowering the power supply VDD becomes a challenging task. Figure 8.4 shows the trend 
of power supply with time and future with negative capacitance MOS technology

be ensured to accomplish the desirable and acceptable performance (high I
on) and 
off-state (also known as static) power consumption (lowI
off) at the same time [14–26].
The rapid scaling of conventional FET device design parameters maintains per￾formance and these requirements cause an exponential increase in leakage current 
(I
OFF). Equations (8.7), (8.8), and (8.9) are alternatives for the power dissipation of the 
VLSI circuit and system. With the help of these equations, the importance of power 
scaling, VDD, can be seen.

current in conventional MOSFET and its dependency on the device design matrix 
component. In-depth and detailed investigations regarding these are beyond the scope 
of this chapter. However, readers can refer to suitable articles and books. Figure 8.3
presents the power supply scaling over time. Figure 8.3 shows that negative capaci￾tance FETs will play a lead role in the future [27–38].
8.3 SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF CONVENTIONAL CMOS 
TECHNOLOGY
Figure 8.5 shows the scope and limitations of conventional CMOS technology. 
Semiconductor devices are generally classified into two categories based on the 
subthreshold slope (SS) defined by Equation (8.10). The first category contains 
MOS devices having SS values larger than 60 mV/decade, such as bulk MOSFET, 
FinFET, FDSOI, NWFET, nanosheet FET (NSFET), and gate all around FET 
(GAA). In expression ‘SS ’, the factor ‘n’ in Equation (8.10) for conventional 
MOSFET could be mathematically reinterpreted by Equation (8.11), which 
is known as equation describing the transport factor. Another category of MOS 
FIGURE 8.5 Scope and limitations of conventional CMOS technology.Mathematical Approach for a Future Semiconductor Roadmap 123
devices has SS lower than 60 mV/decade at room temperature, known as steep 
FET. The most popular candidates in this category are tunnel FET and NCFET. 
In the case of tunnel FET, charge transport is governed by band-to-band tunneling 
in reverse-based operation conditions. This category of devices, like double gate 
tunnel FET, high-K tunnel FET, GAA tunnel FET, and other developments have 
the desirable lower off-state current. However, due to band-to-band tunneling, on￾state charge transport is limited. This causes a lower value of on-state current than 
for conventional MOSFET. This is because of lower switching than conventional 
CMOS devices. This is a specific drawback with the tunnel FET technology. As a 
rule of thumb, a measurement is conducted by semiconductor engineers. However, 
there remain several issues to overcome to realize the continuous improvement of 
semiconductor technology [33–43].

Figure 8.5 illustrates the opportunity for research and development with steep 
subthreshold swing FET devices, circuits, and systems. The availability of negative 
capacitance in ferroelectric materials requires new research and development with 
experts on ferroelectric or negative capacitance [19–50].
8.4 CONCLUSION
In this chapter, we have carefully investigated the key purpose of designing modern 
semiconductors, from various perspectives. Especially, the history of the modern 
semiconductor industry has been covered so that the key factors in future semicon￾ductor design can be easily and intuitively understood. Low subthreshold swing tran￾sistor design is the most important design methodology, since it can achieve low 
power consumption and high performance of transistors at the same time.

9128 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
9.1 GENERALIZED CLASSIFICATION OF FIELD EFFECT DEVICES 
BASED ON FERROELECTRIC
The continuous scaling with conventional MOSFET has reached a plateau. In respect 
of the continuous development with conventional scaling trends, FinFET is one of the 
best examples [1–5]. For further improvements in FinFET, experts have developed 
gate-all-around (GAA) FET structures with improved electrical advantages such as 
lowered short-channel FETs (SCEs), which however suffer from self-heating, such as 
SOI FETs. Self-heating has impaired the search for advancements in this technology 
[6–10].
Another steep subthreshold swing device category is negative capacitance FET, 
denoted as NCFET. This is a thin layer of ferroelectric material sandwiched with a 
conventional MOS structure like bulk NCFET [11–19]. In bulk NCFET, a thin layer 
of ferroelectric material is deposited with conventional dielectrics such as HFO2
 in 
a parallel combination. The ferroelectric material has negative capacitance and an 
applied electric field, and is discussed in the following section in detail [20–25]. 
Impact ionization MOS has lower SS but higher voltage operation. This shows that 
there is less interest in low-voltage applications. Another feature of negative capaci￾tance with conventional MOS devices is that it acts as a voltage amplifier [26–29]. 
A thin layer helps the designer accomplish amplification of the vertical electric field 
(also known as the E-field) which the transistor perceives [30–34]. NCFET stra￾tegically incorporates a ferroelectric (FE) layer within the transistor’s gate, which 
also amplifies the voltage, thereby causing NCFET to run at a lower voltage while 
sustaining its performance with remarkable energy savings.
Ferroelectric materials are a class of dielectric substances that possess a unique 
property called spontaneous electric polarization, which means they have a net 
electric dipole moment even in the absence of an external electric field. This polar￾ization can be reversed and realigned when subjected to an external electric field, 
exhibiting hysteresis behavior. This remarkable characteristic makes ferroelectric 
materials valuable for various technological applications, including but not limited 
to non-volatile memories, sensors, actuators, and electro-optic devices. The devel￾opment and understanding of ferroelectric materials have opened up new avenues in 
nanoelectronics and advanced material science, offering promising possibilities for 
future electronic devices and cutting-edge technologies.
The application and investigation of negative capacitance in other devices has been 
continuous. FET devices with negative capacitance include NC FinFET, NC tunnel 
FET, NC-GAA, and negative capacitance NS FET. Figure 9.1 presents some of the most 
popular semiconductor industry developments for VLSI circuit and system applications. 
The semiconductor industry has utilized the advantages of conventional MOSFET. In 
the series development of conventional MOSFET, FinFET and gate-all-around (GAA) 
has been popular inventions having better gate control, with less short-channel FETs 
(SCEs) having a subthreshold swing (SS) greater than 60 mV/decade. Conventional 
MOSFETs and related FET devices that have been developed show less suitability for 
future uses due to ultra-scaled applications. Nanosheet FETs like FinFET and GAA 
having better scalability and survivability for future have been suggested as possible 
solutions. Another category of MOS devices has SS lower than 60 mV/decade. Tunnel Mathematical Approach for the Foundation of Negative Capacitance 129
NCFET, NC-tunnel FET, and IMOS are common low subthreshold swing devices. 
A rough classification of these based on SS is shown in Figure 9.2 [20–35].
Figure 9.2 shows some advanced developments based on negative capacitance 
research in FinFET, GAA, and nanosheet FETs. The short form of negative cap￾acitance, ‘NC,’ have been added to newly developed FETs known as NC FETs for 
conventional bulk MOSFET. Meanwhile the NC-tunnel FET is used for negative 
capacitance-based tunnel FETs. Here both m- and n-factors have been optimized by 
using band-to-band tunnel transport and ferroelectric material in the conventional 
gate region. Similarly, NC-FinFET, NC-GAA, and negative capacitance nanosheets 
are more advanced developments.
For TFET-based circuit and system applications, the device design element should 
have maximum I
ON, lowest possible SS, and suppressed ambipolar current Iamb. On￾state switching current (I
ON) with possible steep subthreshold swing (SS) having min￾imal ambipolar current (I
amb) are some of the critical design goals for circuit designers 
for ultra-low-power applications.

gap, ΔΦ is the tunneling window, εsi and εox are the dielectric constants of Si and 
oxide material, respectively, and tsi and tox are the thickness of Si and oxide material, 
respectively.
9.2 MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
In the field of electrical engineering, capacitance (C) has been traditionally modeled 
as in Equation (9.1). In Equation (9.1), the variable Q is used for charge that is stored 
on the capacitor’s conductive plates and V is the applied voltage.
C dQ
dV = (9.1)
For CMOS technology, capacitance formed between the gate region is modeled as 
shown in Equation (9.2).

= ( ) − (9.2)
As illustrated in Equation (9.2), the variable Qt
 represents the total charge of the 
intermediate gate (technically, it is also the absolute value which is the same as the 
charge stored in channel layer Qi
) which is equal to the charge in the ferroelectric thin

layer, used on top of the conventional gate dielectric material, that is,Q Q t F = = E i Q . 
Similarly, the FE layer capacitance can be defined as follows:
C dQ
dV FE

Equation (9.3) shows VFE , which is the voltage drop in ferroelectric given by the 
Landau-Khalantikov (L-K) equation in the static state. Here, VG is the gate terminal 
voltage. Cfe is the equivalent capacitance produced in the used ferroelectric thin layer. 
The variable Cint is used for the equivalent in base MOSFET. The variables Cox, Cs, 
and ψs have been used for oxide capacitance, surface potential, and body capacitance, 
respectively. It has been experimentally proved that the surface potential of negative 
capacitance FETs is amplified due to existence of negative capacitance in ferroelec￾tric materials. While the idea of the NCFET could be seen as somewhat simple in 
theory, there has been consistent difficulty in finding and discovering a suitable ferro￾electric material that can be integrated into advanced MOSFETs. Indeed, most known 
ferroelectric materials cannot be used, because they are not CMOS-compatible tech￾nologies. Figure 9.3 presents a sketch diagram for an equivalent capacitance model 
for conventional NCFETs.
As is known for conventional MOSFETs, there is a drain on the source 
current,I V , V DS GS DS = ∫( ), but in the NCFET s I V V V DS NC GS FE DS , , , − = ∫( ) . The voltage 
across ferroelectric material has been modeled in Equation (9.4). As shown in this 
equation, the voltage across FE material depends on the TFE thinness and Landau 
parameters, α, β, and γ.
V Q Q Q T FE t t t FE = + ( ) 246 α β + γ (9.4)
where the variables α, β, and γ are Landau coefficients of the ferroelectric materials 
and TFE is the thickness. Using Equation (9.4), CFE can be calculated with the help of 
Equation (9.5)

The potential barriers of the polarization switching pathways are also among the 
most important properties of ferroelectric materials, which are determined using the 
nudged elastic band method (NEB). The polarization of bulk systems was calculated 
using the Barry phase approach. The Landau free energy (U), estimated by Equation 
(9.6), of the ferroelectric materials is defined using the Landau-Khalantikov theory.
U P = + α βP P + − γ E P. 2 4 6 (9.6)
where the variables α, β, and γ are the Landau coefficients of the ferroelectric 
materials, which vary with biaxial strain. In Equation (9.6), E is the external field. 132 Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistors
The L-K variables in Equation (9.6) vary with biaxial strain. When a material is under 
the ferroelectric phase, it starts making a stable polarization state which minimizes 
its free energy (U) landscape. These stable states, that is ∂

displacement field as shown in Figure 9.4. Pr is the remnant polarization, E is the 
applied electric field, and Ec

Figure 9.5 presents the capacitance model for negative capacitance FET devices. 
As shown in Figure 9.4, a thin layer of ferroelectric materials is sandwich on the top 
of conventional dielectric materials like HfO2
 [40–59]. The key factor to understand 
the overall principle of the negative capacitance effect is that the negative differ￾ential capacitance of ferroelectric (CEF<0) compensates for the positive capacitance 
(CMOS>0) in the device such that the resulting gate capacitance, C C C G FE MOS = + ( ) − − − 1 1 1
,
can be made larger than CMOS [60–62].
The ferroelectric layer, which amplifies the gate voltage of the baseline MOSFET, 
was modeled based on the L-K equation, as defined in Equation (9.7).

where the variables ρ and P are the resistivity and polarization, respectively. When the 
ferroelectric material is under a steady state, (dP
dt = 0), E can be written as shown 
in Equation (9.8)
E = + 2 4 P P + 6 P 3 5 α β γ (9.8)
which is induced through polarization of the ferroelectric layer. Negative capacitance 
is available in a series connection of a ferroelectric and normal capacitor

In Equation (9.9),CEq is the equivalent capacitance, CFE is the capacitance due to 
ferroelectric material, and CBase−MOS

available in normal MOSFET devices, like bulk MOSFET.
One of the most important aspects of NCFETs is that they have a large internal 
amplification factor, and the β, is known as the lowering of the body factor, because

9.3 CONCLUSION
In this chapter, various mathematical approaches have been introduced in order to 
advance the understanding of NCFET. Thanks to the physical mechanism of selected 
oxide layers, the NCFET could serve as the next-generation transistor, to be aimed 
for high-performance CPUs with sub-7 nm technology nodes. These ferroelec￾tric materials could enable a huge breakthrough in modern semiconductor tech￾nology, where the limitation of scaling has put severe limitations on semiconductor 
development.
