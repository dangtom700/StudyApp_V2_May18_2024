Promoting pollination and 
pollinators in farmingIt is widely recognised that agriculture is a significant contributor to global warming 
and climate change. Agriculture needs to reduce its environmental impact and adapt 
to current climate change whilst still feeding a growing population, i.e. become more 
‘climate-smart’. Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing is playing its part in achieving this by 
bringing together key research on making the production of the world’s most important 
crops and livestock products more sustainable.
Based on extensive research, our publications specifically target the challenge of 
climate-smart agriculture. In this way we are using ‘smart publishing’ to help achieve 
climate-smart agriculture.
Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing is an independent and innovative publisher 
delivering high quality customer-focused agricultural science content in both print 
and online formats for the academic and research communities. Our aim is to build 
a foundation of knowledge on which researchers can build to meet the challenge of 
climate-smart agriculture.

Introduction
It has been reported that up to 95% of all flowering plants require the services 
of other organisms to move pollen from male to female flower parts during the 
pollination process. These organisms, including bees, are collectively known 
as pollinators. However, in light of the growing evidence of global declines 
in pollinator species, the management, ecology and conservation of wild and 
managed pollinators is a subject of growing importance and research activity.
This volume reviews the wealth of research on our current understanding 
of existing pollination processes and their importance to our global 
ecosystems. The book considers how pollinators interact with plants, as well as 
the major threats to pollinator species, including climate change, diseases and 
pesticide exposure. The book is split into three parts: Part 1 chapters focus on 
understanding pollinators and pollination, focusing specifically on their role in 
agriculture, the role and application of olfaction and the use of wind pollination 
in crop plants. Chapters in Part 2 examine the various threats to pollinators, 
such as the impact of climate change, disease, the use of neonicotinoid 
insecticides and pesticides as well as the impact of alien bees on native 
ones. Part 3 chapters review promoting pollinators and pollination, focusing 
specifically on the role of habitat conservation and restoration, the alteration 
of crop management practices and the use of ecological network approaches. 
Chapters also highlight best management practices for pollinator protection, 
focusing specifically on US apple production and the use of entomovectoring 
technology. 
Part 1 Understanding pollinators and pollination
The first chapter of this volume provides an overview of what pollination is 
and the role of pollinators in agriculture. Chapter 1 begins by discussing the 
basics of pollination and goes on to discuss pollinators and their diversity. The 
chapter moves on to review the ecology and evolution of floral traits, focusing 
specifically on the origins of flowering plants and their relationship with 
pollinators, floral traits and the ecology of pollination as well as the co-evolution 
of plants and pollinators. A section on domestication and its impact on plant￾pollinator relationships is also provided, which is then followed by an analysis of 
how pollinators impact agriculture and how pollinators are present in modern 
agriculture practices. 
The next chapter examines the role and application of olfaction in crop 
plant-pollinator interactions. Chapter 2 introduces the background and 
theory underpinning the use of odours by insects in pollinators. It discusses © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
xx Introduction
how flowers produce odours and highlights issues specific to crops such as 
selective breeding. It then explores current technologies and case studies in 
which natural or synthetic odours on or near the crop, and the interaction with 
insects, influences visitation, pollination success and yield.
Chapter 3 reviews the role of wind pollination in crop plants. This chapter 
reflects on the early transition from wind-pollinated species (especially Poaceae) 
into crop species and the current state of wind-pollination in agricultural 
pollination networks. It then provides a short review of the evolution and 
biomechanics of wind pollination to establish why humans moved away from 
open pollination. A more deep exploration of the relative importance (or lack 
thereof) in crops such Zea, Triticum, Oryza, and Secale follows, as does a focus 
on the extant risk of heterospecific pollen transfer to wind-pollinated weeds. 
The chapter also discusses the role of anthropogenic climate change on wind￾pollinated crops and the future and relative importance of wind-pollination 
in widespread and niche crops. The chapter ends with a case study of how 
one might create a ‘win-win’ in terms of conservation and restoration of natural 
habitats to promote wind-pollination in farming.
Part 2 Threats to pollinators
Part 2 opens with a chapter that focuses on assessing the impacts of climate 
change on pollinators. Chapter 4 first presents an overview of observed and 
predicted impacts of climate change on pollinators, focusing on elements 
such as rising temperatures, loss of habitat, temporal and spatial mismatches 
between plants and pollinators and extreme events. The chapter also highlights 
the effect climate change has on pollinator cues, factors that may mediate 
species’ responses, including synergisms with other threatening processes. A 
section emphasising the importance of understanding climate change impacts 
on pollinators is also provided, which is then followed by a section presenting a 
number of ways in which we can help pollinators face the challenge of climate 
change.
Chapter 5 looks at the impact of diseases on pollinators. The chapter first 
provides an analysis of various honey bee diseases, focusing specifically on 
ectoparasitic mites, viruses, fungi, bacteria, trypanosomes and common pests 
such as the small hive beetle and wax moths. It also discusses how disease 
impact on honey bee colonies and pollination can be measured. A section 
on the poorly known wild bee diseases is also provided, discussing the major 
known pests and pathogens of both bumble bees and other solitary bee 
species. The chapter reviews disease transmission, spillover and spillback in all 
three pollinator taxa as well as some of the current methods and approaches 
for controlling pests and pathogens. © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Introduction xxi
The next chapter focuses on how neonicotinoid insecticides affect bees 
and other pollinators. Chapter 6 discusses the wide range of research on how 
neonicotinoids affect both managed and wild bee populations in particular. 
It reviews levels of environmental contamination and how this affects topical 
and oral exposure routes. The chapter also addresses sublethal effects and 
briefly discusses the interaction of different stressors. It includes a number of 
case studies showing the negative effects of neonicotinoids on a range of bee 
species.
Moving on from Chapter 6, Chapter 7 examines the impact of pesticides 
on pollinators. The chapter begins by providing an overview of the origins 
of bee testing and risk assessment, then moves on to discuss the testing of 
pesticide effects in pollinators, drawing attention to species testing, testing 
methodologies and designs and guidelines and risk assessment guidance 
documents. The chapter also examines test method development and 
validation and highlights the principles of Good Laboratory Practice. A section 
on the ecotoxicological risk assessment for pollinators is included, which is then 
followed by an analysis of both the indirect and sublethal effects of pesticides. 
Risk mitigation and pesticide incident monitoring are also discussed.
The final chapter of Part 2 reviews the impact of alien bees on native ones. 
Chapter 8 explores the main impacts of alien bees on native bees through 
competition for food or nesting resources, interference, pathogen spillover 
and genetic contamination. Implications for native bee conservation are also 
discussed. In addition, in this chapter, a particular focus on the first alien bee 
that colonised Europe, Megachile sculpturalis is also emphasised. The chapter 
also highlights the main knowledge gaps and important trends for future 
research. Finally, avenues for managing alien bee species and preventing their 
introduction are provided.
Part 3 Promoting pollinators and pollination
Chapter 9 focuses on challenges and options in habitat restoration for solitary 
bees which account for 90% of bee species. As well as being important parts of 
local ecosystems, these species are pollinators of a wide range of crops such 
as alfalfa, tomato, eggplant and blueberries, cucurbit crops (such as pumpkin, 
squash and watermelon) as well as orchard crops such as almonds and cherries. 
The chapter looks at challenges facing habitat restoration and research on the 
effectiveness of existing restoration projects. The chapter also includes case 
studies on commercial management of Alkali bees, promoting stem or cavity￾nesting bees and providing underground nesting boxes for bumblebees.
The next chapter of Part 2 draws attention to the alteration of crop 
management practices to promote pollinators. Chapter 10 begins by 
introducing the current approaches that are currently used when it comes © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
xxii Introduction
to managing production space for pollinators within the context of various 
cropping systems, such as row crops, specialty crops, perennial orchards and 
perennial forage and pasture systems. The chapter then goes on to provide 
several case studies demonstrating these approaches, drawing specific 
attention to annual row and specialty crop systems as well as perennial orchard 
and forage systems. Assessing the efficacy of alternative agronomic practices 
is also discussed.
The subject of Chapter 11 is the use of ecological network approaches 
for promoting pollinators in agriculture. The chapter begins by describing 
the important and agriculturally relevant characteristics and structures in 
plant-pollinator networks. It then moves on to examine the use of ecological 
networks at the field, farm, landscape and national scale. The chapter also 
highlights the importance of filling in major gaps in pollinator networks. A 
section on embedding pollination within wider agroecosystem networks is 
also provided, which is followed by an analysis of the potential next steps for 
pollination network research. 
Chapter 12 describes a set of pollinator best management practices 
(BMPs) for US apple production. It first provides an overview of apple orchard 
pollinators, drawing specific attention to ground nesting bees, mason bees, 
small carpenter bees and wild bumble bee queens. The chapter moves on to 
provide an overview of the various pests and diseases that can affect apple 
production. This is then followed by a section that highlights the potential 
hazards to pollinators from apple pest management practices. The chapter also 
examines best management practices to promote pollinators as well as the use 
of integrated pest and pollinator management and pesticide application to 
manage apple pests and diseases. 
The final chapter of the book focuses on using pollinators to spread 
biocontrol agents via the use of entomovectoring technology. Chapter 13 first 
highlights the factors that are important for successful entomovectoring, such 
as the type of vector, the dispenser, the biocontrol agent product and biosafety. 
The chapter moves on to provide successful and failed attempts at using 
bumble bees as vectors for entomovectoring. This section is then followed by 
a case study that focuses on entomovectoring (also known as apivectoring) 
of microbial biological control agents by Bombus spp., especially B. terrestris, 
against grey mould Botrytis cinerea and other pests in strawberry production, 
drawing specific attention to the importance of tackling and controlling Botrytis 
cinerea infection in strawberries.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

1 Introduction
The Altamira cave system in northern Spain is renowned for the contemporary 
depictions of Paleolithic life that adorn its walls in vivid blacks, reds, and 
ochres. But tucked away from the main chamber’s iconic herds of bison is an 
inconspicuous painting in an unassuming side chamber. It depicts a gangly 
human figure climbing a winding structure – most likely, a ladder. At the upper 
end of the ladder are four thick, overlapping arches nested within each other, 
surrounded by thin winged figures – the nest of a wild honey bee colony, and 
the bees themselves. This painting at Altamira, dated 13500 years old, is a 
prehistoric account of beekeeping – the oldest one known to this day (Crane, 
1999). Similar paintings depicting ladders, bees’ nests, and bees are found in 
prehistoric art across the world: primarily in South Africa, but also in Australia, 
India, France, and Spain (Crane, 1986). They are a testament that even in the 
earliest chapters of human history, humankind has relied on the activities of 
pollinators.
Honey bees, their flower-visiting habits, and their industrious honey￾making skills have undoubtedly been appreciated by the humans of the 
ancient world, appearing in Aristotle’s History of Animals, Virgil’s Georgics,

and the Old Testament. The Romans and Greeks were well aware of the 
importance of pollination in the production of date palms (Ficus carica); the 
polymath Theophrastus (c 371–287 bc) described the plant’s ‘male and female’ 
flowers and the necessity of a ‘union’ between two flower types for the trees 
to bear fruit. But it was only much later, in the late seventeenth century, that 
Rudolf Jakob Camerarius (1665–1721) observed that male anthers and female 
stigmas were prerequisites to plant reproduction. His work was built upon by 
the investigations of several botanists, including Bradley (1731), Miller (1724), 
and Vaillant (1718); by the early eighteenth century, it was widely accepted that 
pollen, known as the Farina Fecundens, was the mode of sexual transmission 
of plants.
The work of Kölreuter (1733–1806) was fundamental in establishing the 
importance of insect vectors in the transport of pollen, the structure and 
mechanism of pollen, and the role of nectar in attracting pollinators. Sprengel 
(1750–1816) further examined the structure and function of flower parts, 
describing in detail a diversity of floral adaptations involved in attracting 
pollinators. Darwin’s (1809–1882) publication of The Origin of Species and 
his studies on pollination mechanisms (notably his work with orchids) were 
followed by a surge of interest in pollination; this included Hermann Müller’s 
(1829–1883) and Federico Delpino’s (1868–1875) investigations into a myriad 
of plant–pollinator systems and Knuth’s seminal Handbook of Flower Pollination 
series (Knuth 1906–1909). With the twentieth century came the advent of 
genetics, the discovery of DNA, and an explosion of interest in plant ecology. 
Such discoveries shifted the study of pollination toward understanding the 
molecular mechanisms, evolutionary history, and interspecies relationships 
that govern pollination. There are countless contributors to this recent era of 
pollination studies, in addition to others that were crucial in the discovery of 
pollination and its basic mechanisms. Their work is beyond the scope of this brief 
introduction; for further reading, Proctor (1996a) provides a comprehensive 
summary.
2 The basics of pollination
Pollination is a key first step in plant reproduction. But to understand pollination, 
one must first be familiar with how pollen is produced. Pertinent floral structures 
are shown in Fig. 1. The corolla, which is the shape and structure formed by a 
flower’s petals, serves chiefly to attract pollinators. The calyx (or sepals) protects 
the flower in the bud and serves as a structural support for the corolla. The 
androecium (or stamens) are the male reproductive structures of flowers 
consisting of anthers that each rest atop a structural filament. The gynoecium
is the collective female reproductive structure comprised of individual stigmas
resting upon a style that connects to the ovary, where the flower’s ovules reside.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 5
The anthers are the site of pollen production. At maturity, the inner cells 
of the anther undergo meiosis to produce individual pollen grains. The outer 
layers of the anthers then split open, or dehisce, to release pollen. Appearing as 
a powdery, fine substance to the naked eye, pollen is made up of microscopic 
grains, each surrounded by an outer wall, or exine, that gives the grains their 
distinct shape and rigidity. The aid of a microscope will reveal that the pollen 
exines are covered in pores. An inner wall of cellulose and pectin, known as an 
intine, further protects the interior of the grain, which contains the gametes in 
the form of a generative nucleus and a supplemental vegetative nucleus.
Pollination is simply the transfer of pollen from the anthers of the 
androecium to the stigmas of the gynoecium. Following pollination is 
fertilization, which begins as the pollen grain attaches to the stigma, imbibes 
water, and germinates to form a pollen tube that penetrates the stigma’s tissue 
and carves a path through the style to ovules in the ovary. The grain’s vegetative 
nucleus moves through the newly formed tube, mediating the movement of 
the generative nucleus (Zhou and Meier, 2014), which has now divided into 
two separate male gametes. Upon arrival at the ovule, the vegetative nucleus 
dissolves, and one of the male gametes fuses with the egg to form a diploid 
embryo. The second male gamete fuses with a diploid fusion nucleus in the 
ovary, forming the endosperm that provides nutrients for the newly formed 
seed.
In angiosperms (flowering plants), most species bear hermaphrodite 
perfect flowers, containing both pollen-producing and ovule-bearing structures. 
An obvious consequence of this hermaphroditism is autogamy, the self￾fertilization of a flower by its own pollen. Plants may also self-fertilize through 
Figure 1 Cross-section of a mature flower and its components.6 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?

geitonogamy, the fertilization of a flower by the pollen of another flower on 
the same plant. About 20% of angiosperms reproduce predominantly by self￾fertilization (Barrett, 2003), and many plants reproduce through self-fertilization 
to some degree (Barrett, 2003; Goodwillie et al., 2005; Charlesworth, 2006; but 
see Lande and Schemske, 1985; Igić and Kohn, 2006). Self-fertilization grants 
the advantage of guaranteed reproduction, especially in environments where 
mates or pollinators are scarce (Kalisz et al., 2004; Aizen and Harder, 2007; 
reviewed in Busch and Delph, 2012).
The alternative reproductive strategy is outcrossing, fertilization with non￾self-pollen. Darwin (1877) wrote that ‘[Nature] abhors perpetual self-fertilization’. 
Although inbreeding depression – the reduced survival and fertility of inbred 
offspring – is surprisingly uncommon in predominantly selfing plants (Husband 
and Schemske, 1996), self-fertilization is disadvantageous to outcrossing 
when considering gene flow, genetic variability, and diversification of plant 
lineages (Goldberg et al., 2010). Outcrossing plants employ mechanisms to 
minimize self-fertilization (Barrett, 2003). A common anti-selfing mechanism 
in plants is the spatial (herkogamy) and temporal (dichogamy) separation 
of pollen and stigma. In herkogamy, the anthers and stigma are physically 
separate, such that pollen cannot be passively transferred to the stigma. In 
dichogamy, the anthers mature asynchronously with the receptive period of 
the stigmas. Rather than relying on spatio-temporal separation, some plants 
separate anthers and stigmas into unisexual imperfect flowers, which can be 
a more effective mechanism to avoid self-fertilization. Monoecious plants bear 
both male and female imperfect flowers on the same plant (Fig. 2b); the plants 
are still hermaphroditic and may self-fertilize. Monoecious crops include corn, 
oil palms, and members of the Cucurbitaceae family (e.g. melons, pumpkins, 
cucumbers, and zucchini). Dioecious plants only bear flowers of one sex and 
must rely on a plant with opposite-sexed flowers to reproduce (Fig. 2c) – in 
this way, dioecy is the only mechanism that fully prevents self-fertilization. 
Dioecious crops are uncommon; some examples are asparagus, kiwi fruit, and 
hops. Finally, plants may prevent self-fertilization through self-incompatibility, 
a variety of biochemical barriers to the fertilization process. The mechanisms 
governing self-incompatibility vary widely across taxa; Glover (2014) provides 
a review. One mechanism of self-incompatibility is evident to many humans 
across the globe: the allergic response to pollen, commonly known as hay fever, 
is caused by self-incompatibility proteins that coat the pollen grain surfaces of 
some plant species (Proctor, 1996b).
Pollination vectors transport pollen from anthers to stigmas. Pollen transfer 
can be achieved abiotically, through wind (anemophily) or water (hydrophily). 
The vast majority of abiotically pollinated plants are anemophilous (Ackerman, 
2000), with nearly all gymnosperms (Faegri and van der Pijl, 1979) and 10% 
of all flowering plants transporting their pollen through the wind (Friedman © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 7
Figure 2 Floral traits and reproductive systems vary widely across plant taxa, including 
crop plants. (A) Brassica napus. The oilseed rape has bright, four-petalled flowers with 
four prominent anthers and two shorter anthers. Most other Brassica crops (e.g. kale, 
turnips, and bok choy) display similar four-petalled, yellow flowers. (B) Cucurbita pepo.
Cucurbit crops, such as squash, pumpkin, melons, and cucumber, are monoecious. 
Individual plants produce both pollen-producing male flowers and stigma-bearing 
female flowers. On female flowers, the stigma and style connect to the developing fruit 
at the flower’s base. (C) Actinidia deliciosa. Kiwifruit vines are dioecious, with male and 
female flowers occurring on separate plants. The male flowers bear numerous showy 
anthers. Prominently displayed in the centers of female flowers are fertile stigmas 
surrounded by a crown of sterile ‘false anthers’. (D) The floral head, or capitulum, of a 
sunflower, Helianthus annus, is made up of many small ray florets (rf), with yellow petals 
surrounding a head of disk florets (df). Composite flower heads are characteristic in 
Asteraceae plants. (E) Medicago sativa. The complex flowers of alfalfa are wholly reliant 
on pollinators. The flowers’ stigmas and anthers are sprung up inside two ‘keel petals.’ 
When a bee lands on the keel petal, it ‘trips’ the flower and the reproductive structures 
are explosively unfurled, releasing pollen. In the untripped flower (un), the intact keel 
petals enclose the reproductive structures. The exposed stigma and a remaining keel 
petal are visible on the tripped flower (tr). (F) Oryza sativa. Most major cereal crops, like 
rice shown here, are either self- or wind-pollinated. Characteristic of Poaceae plants: the 
inflorescence of rice bears dull, inconspicuous florets with many anthers.8 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?

and Barrett, 2009). Several key cereal crops, including maize (Zea mays), rye 
(Secale cereale), and foxtail millet (Setaria italica), are strictly anemophilous 
(Saunders, 2018). Anemophilous flowers follow an archetypal structure or 
syndrome: small, inconspicuous floral displays and copious production of 
dry, powdery pollen. Wind-pollinated plants maximize pollination success by 
producing large amounts of pollen. A single inflorescence of rye, for example, 
produces over 67000 pollen grains (Piotrowska, 2008). Furthermore, 
anemophilous flowers commonly bear stigmas with large surface areas, 
increasing the ‘target area’ for pollen to land on (Proctor, 1996c). There are 
no crops that are pollinated via hydrophily – hydrophily is relatively rare, 
occurring in about 2.7% of angiosperm families (Ackerman, 2000) and 
2% of plants (Faegri and van der Pijl, 1979). Unlike anemophilous plants, 
hydrophilous flowers do not follow a syndrome; this reflects the scattered 
and diverse origins, occurrence, and modes of hydrophily across plant 
taxa (Proctor, 1996c). Generally, hydrophilous pollen floats across or under 
water to reach mature stigmas. Hydrophilous plants are more diverse in their 
adaptations but generally rely on elongated stigmas and pollen modifications 
such as larger size or stickiness that allow grains to accumulate in ‘rafts’ (Cox, 
1988). Wind and water are commonly used but often unreliable modes of 
transferring pollen to another flower of the same plant species: relying on a 
fluid pollination vector is a game of chance, dependent on the direction and 
flow of the fluid. As a protein-rich substance, pollen is costly to make, and in 
abiotic pollination a very low proportion of pollen ends up fertilizing ovules. 
A vast majority of flowering plants have instead evolved to rely on animals as 
pollination vectors.
3 Pollinators and their diversity
Pollinators are biotic pollen vectors: animals that visit flowers and transfer 
pollen. The importance of animal pollination cannot be overstated: 87.5% of 
angiosperms are pollinated by animals in some form (Ollerton et al., 2011). 
Many animals visit flowers incidentally or occasionally to consume nectar or 
pollen. Although these visitors may sometimes transfer pollen – and are in a 
sense still ‘pollinators’ – their efficiency and significance as pollinators are 
negligible compared to those that regularly visit flowers and have co-evolved 
specialized structures and behaviors for collecting floral rewards and facilitating 
pollination. Pollinators’ visitations to plants can be described as generalist
– involving a wide array of flower taxa, or specialist – sharing pollination 
relationships with one or a few species of plants. But pollinators themselves are

What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 9
The pollination services provided by insects are undoubtedly the most 
consequential form of biotic pollination. Most insect pollinators are in the orders: 
Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Hymenoptera (bees, 
ants, wasps,) and Diptera (flies), but significant pollinators are also in the insect 
orders: Plecoptera (stoneflies), Hemiptera (bugs), Mecoptera (scorpionflies), 
and Thysanoptera (thrips). Incidental insect visitors have also been observed 
in nine other orders of insects (Yeo, 1996; Ollerton, 2017). However, by far 
the most prolific flower visitors and important insect pollinators are the bees 
(Anthophila), which have co-evolved a suite of specialized pollen-collecting 
structures and behaviors with a suite of flowering plant families (Neff and 
Simpson, 1996; Danforth, 2007). There are 20000 bee species worldwide, 
and with few exceptions, all are pollinators (Ascher and Pickering, 2018). 
Eusocial bees live in populous colonies with reproductive queens and males 
and sterile ‘workers.’ Eusociality can be found in many species in the family 
Apidae (honey bees, bumble bees, carpenter bees, and stingless bees) and the 
family Halictidae (sweat bees). But over 90% of bee species are instead solitary 
– females are fertile, build their own nests, and forage alone for floral resources 
for their offspring (Danforth et al., 2019a).
Significant pollinators are also found in the insect families Lepidoptera, 
Diptera, and Coleoptera. Dipterans are the second most frequent flower 
visitors after bees (Larson et al., 2001), with visitation observed in at least 
86 families of Diptera, especially in the families Syrphidae (hover flies), 
Bombyliidae (bee flies), Empididae (dance flies), Tabanidae (horse and deer 
flies), and Muscidae (muscid flies) (Winfree et al., 2011; Inouye et al., 2015). 
Dipterans are primary pollinators of cacao, mango, cashew, cherry, and tea; 
they have also been used to substitute hand pollination in small-flowered 
plants such as onions, parsnips, carrots, celery, and brassica crops (Free, 1970; 
Rader et al., 2012, 2016; Inouye et al., 2015). Nectar-feeding Lepidopterans 
are also prevalent pollinators, with over 140000 flower-visiting species; they 
are the most diverse group of pollinators (Ollerton, 2017). Flower visitors are 
prevalent in the butterfly families Hesperiidae (skippers) and Papilionidae 
(common butterflies). Moths are major nocturnal pollinators (Willmer, 2011), 
particularly those in the families Sphingidae (hawkmoths), Noctuidae (owlet 
moths), and Geometridae (geometer moths) (Winfree et al., 2011). In North 
America and Europe, Lepidopterans are likely not crucial to crop pollination 
but are essential in maintaining the biodiversity of agroecosystems by serving 
as pollinators of non-crop plants (Hahn and Brühl, 2016). Coleopterans are 
particularly important pollinators in tropical ecosystems, but compared to the 
insect groups discussed so far, their role as pollinators is least understood 
(Wardhaugh, 2015; Sayers et al., 2019). Flower visitors have been observed 
in 60 beetle families, with pollinators found in the families Cantharidae (e.g. 
soldier beetles), Cerambycidae (longhorn beetles), Chrysomelidae (leaf 10 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?

beetles), Curculionidae (weevils), Elateridae (click beetles), Melyridae (e.g. soft￾winged flower beetles), Mordellidae (tumbling flower beetles), Nitidulidae (sap 
beetles), Scarabaeidae (scarabs), and Staphylinidae (rove beetles) (Sayers et al., 
2019). They are primary pollinators of oil palms, sugar and custard apples, 
soursop, cherimoya, and nutmeg (Irvine and Armstrong, 1990; Westerkamp 
and Gottsberger, 2000; Rader et al., 2016).
Pollinators can also be found in various non-insect taxa including birds, 
mammals, reptiles, crustaceans, and marine worms (Ollerton, 2017). Of 
these, birds and bats are of particular importance for flowering plants. Bird 
pollinators contribute to the pollination of 65 flowering plant families and are 
important pollinators in situations with limited insect density, such as high￾altitude ecosystems, dry environments, winter months, and islands where 
insect colonization is poor (Cronk and Ojeda, 2008; Regan et al., 2015). An 
array of birds can be pollinators, but the specialized nectar-collecting tongues 
and flower-seeking behaviors typical in families Trochilidae (hummingbirds), 
Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and Nectariniidae (sunbirds and spiderhunters) 
make them especially effective as pollinators. Independent radiations of 
these nectar-eaters across the world have established a dominant group 
in each region: hummingbirds in the Americas, honeyeaters in Australasia 
and the Pacific, and the sunbirds and spiderhunters in Africa, southern Asia, 
and Australasia (Cronk and Ojeda, 2008). Birds are primary pollinators of 
pineapple guava (Acca sellowiana) and manila hemp (Musa textilis) (Itino 
et al., 1991; Macfarlane, 1995). Bat pollinators occur primarily in the Old World 
Pteropidae and the New World Phyllostomatidae (Kunz et al., 2011), collectively 
contributing to the pollination of 528 species across 67 plant families (Fleming 
and Sosa, 1994). As with birds, nectarivorous bats possess specialized nectar￾feeding morphologies, such as elongated snouts and long tongues (Kunz et al., 
2011). Bats are primary pollinators for wild bananas and durian (Vogel and 
Westerkamp, 1991; Westerkamp and Gottsberger, 2000).
4 The ecology and evolution of floral traits
4.1 The origins of flowering plants and their relationships with 
pollinators
The rapid development as far as we can judge of all the higher plants within recent 
geological times is an abominable mystery.
– Charles Darwin in a letter to James Hooker (Darwin, 1879)
Angiosperms, or flowering plants, comprise 79% of the estimated 374000 
listed plant species (Christenhusz and Byng, 2016) – a remarkable diversity 
that is crucial in the structure and ecology of terrestrial ecosystems (Friis et al., © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 11
1987). Equally impressive is the rate at which angiosperms have emerged: over 
half of angiosperm taxa are thought to have emerged no later than 77 million 
years ago (Mya), with all angiosperms descending from lineages that appeared 
no later than 130 Mya (Magallón and Castillo, 2009; reviewed in Doyle, 2012; 
Coiro et al., 2019). Darwin’s ‘abominable mystery’ is popularly used to refer 
to questions referring to this ‘angiosperm radiation’, as the seemingly sudden 
appearance of flowering plants in the fossil record must have been perplexing 
to his gradualist views toward evolution (Friedman, 2009; but see Buggs, 2021). 
What was the catalyst of such extraordinary radiation in angiosperms? Though 
many other factors such as climate and superior growth traits over gymnosperms 
have been implicated (reviewed in Augusto et al., 2014), it is widely accepted 
that insect pollinators were a substantial driver in the angiosperm radiation of 
the mid-Cretaceous (Grimaldi, 1999; Ollerton et al., 2011; van der Niet et al., 
2014).
The origins of the intimate relationships between flowering plants and 
their pollinators are equally unresolved. It is likely that insects had been 
pollinating gymnosperms before angiosperms were prevalent; this is bolstered 
by numerous amber specimens of insects with specialized pollen-collecting 
mouthparts, most with gymnosperm pollen on their bodies (Ren et al., 2009; 
Peñalver et al., 2012, 2015; Peris et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2018). Of these ancient 
gymnosperm pollinators, some inevitably went extinct, while others gave rise 
to extant gymnosperm pollinators (while most modern gymnosperms are 
primarily wind-pollinated, some taxa – including cycads and many species in 
Gnetales – are insect pollinated; Rydin and Bolinder, 2015). However, some 
ancient gymnosperm pollinators may have transitioned to angiosperms with 
the advent of the angiosperm radiation in the Cretaceous; along with insects 
that formed novel associations with angiosperms (such as the Anthophila, 
bees), they became the predecessors of modern angiosperm pollinators (Peris 
et al., 2017). By the mid-Cretaceous, insects were the dominant pollen vectors 
of angiosperms (Dilcher, 2000; Gandolfo et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2008), with the 
earliest direct evidence of insect-angiosperm pollination relationships dating to 
99 Mya (Bao et al., 2019). Phylogenetic studies suggest that insect pollination is 
the ancestral state of angiosperms, with anemophily and ambophily (dual wind 
and insect pollination) evolving as a response to pollinator limitation and other 
abiotic changes in the environment (Culley et al., 2002).
4.2 Floral traits and the ecology of pollination
Flower characteristics, or floral traits, in angiosperms are as diverse as the 
taxa itself – Figure 2 displays some examples in crops. Floral traits encompass 
the morphology of flowers (including the shape, size, and structure of the 
corolla; the quantity and arrangement of stamens and stigmas; and the 12 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?

form of the ovary), floral architecture (the arrangement of flowers on a 
plant), and secondary chemicals (color and fragrance). Floral traits serve 
chiefly as ‘advertisements’ that guide pollinators to floral rewards (pollen 
and nectar) and as facilitators of pollen transfer. The floral trait differences in 
monkeyflowers (Mimulus spp.) highlight the variation and role of several floral 
traits in attracting pollinators, even within a single genus. The pink flowers of 
the predominantly bee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii produce small amounts of 
nectar and have wide-petalled corollas that form ‘landing platforms’ for bees. 
In contrast, the red, slender, nectar-rich flowers of Mimulus cardinalis are 
more attractive to their hummingbird pollinators (Schemske and Bradshaw, 
1999). Furthermore, both species produced different fragrance profiles, with 
the scent of M. lewisii evoking significantly stronger neural responses in 
bumblebees (Byers, 2014). 
Floral rewards – primarily nectar and pollen – provide the incentives 
for animal pollinators to visit. Floral rewards provide nutrients that are 
essential for the growth, development, and reproduction of the pollinators 
that consume them. Nectar is primarily a carbohydrate source but can also 
be a source of inorganic ions and amino acids (Nicolson and Thornburg, 
2007); pollen is rich in lipids, proteins, and amino acids (Roulston et al., 
2000; Michener, 2007; reviewed in Brodschneider and Crailsheim, 2010; 
Vaudo et al., 2015). Nectar, which is derived from photosynthetic products, 
is relatively more economical to produce than pollen, whose production 
requires nitrogen and phosphorus, which are often limiting resources 
(Proctor, 1996b). Furthermore, pollen comes at a reproductive cost since 
it serves as both a floral reward and a carrier of the plant’s male gametes. 
Despite this, some plants, such as poppies (genus Papaver), solely produce 
pollen as a floral reward, which may have evolved to recruit pollen￾dependent bees (Proctor, 1996b). Finally, in place of pollen and nectar, some 
plants excrete oily substances or resins, which are collected by pollinators 
as an energy source or a nest construction material (Armbruster, 1984). 
Some bee species have niche uses for such rewards – honey bees display a 
rare instance of self-medication in invertebrates and collect plant resins to 
improve resistance to pathogens (Simone-Finstrom and Spivak, 2010). Male 
euglossine bees gather fragrant secretions of orchids, presumably to attract 
mates (Williams and Whitten, 1983; Ray and Vendrame, 2018). In brood-site 
pollination, the host plant serves as an ideal mating site or a place to lay eggs. 
For example, the decaying pods of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) are 
primary mating sites for the tree’s primary biting midge pollinators (Winder 
and Silva, 1972). A highly specialized brood-site pollination relationship 
occurs in most fig species (Ficus spp.), which bear male and female flowers 
in hollow receptacles. The wasp pollinators of figs lay their eggs inside galls 
that form from the ovaries of neutered female flowers. Wingless and eyeless © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 13
males emerge first, locating and fertilizing females before promptly dying. 
Fertilized adult females leave their galls and the receptacle, collecting pollen 
from male flowers positioned at the exit. They then find another receptacle 
to lay their eggs in, fertilizing fertile female flowers in the process (Kerdelhué 
et al., 1996).
Differences in floral reward quality and quantity can vary widely. For 
example, nectar volume in individual flowers can differ across and within 
species (Cruden et al., 1983; Potts et al., 2004; Farkas et al., 2012). For most 
angiosperms, sucrose, fructose, and glucose are the predominant sugars 
in nectar. But variation in the activity of the enzyme invertase, which cleaves 
disaccharide sucrose into monosaccharide fructose and glucose, results in 
interspecific differences in nectar ratios for the three sugars (Nicolson and 
Thornburg, 2007). Nectar concentrations – the amount of sugar in nectar – are 
also variable across species: for example, the nectar of pepper (Capsicum 
annum) has sugar concentrations of less than 6% weight by weight (w/w) 
compared to the average 76% w/w concentrations found in oregano (Origanum 
vulgare) (Pamminger et al., 2019). Nectar concentrations within species can 
also be highly variable: for example, sugar levels in Pima cotton, Gossypium 
barbadense, can range from 34% w/w to 62% w/w (Pamminger et al., 2019). 
Pollen displays similar inconsistencies in nutritional content across species, with 
interspecific differences in concentrations and diversity in amino acids, lipids 
(2–60%), and proteins (1–20%) (Roulston et al., 2000; Weiner et al., 2010; Russo 
et al., 2019; Vaudo et al., 2020).
Differences in the quality and quantity of floral rewards can have major 
ecological consequences. Pollinator species have specific nutritional 
requirements, and so their foraging decisions are affected by the nutritional 
quality of floral rewards (Behmer and Joern, 2008). The sugar ratios and 
concentrations of nectar, for instance, are often associated with the specific 
pollinators that visit the plant (Baker and Baker, 1990; van Wyk et al., 1993; 
Perret et al., 2001; Krömer et al., 2008; Abrahamczyk et al., 2017). Sugar 
concentrations may affect pollinator choice because it influences the viscosity 
of nectar. Nectar-eating birds and lepidopterans, which are suction feeders, 
prefer nectar concentrations of 30–40%, while most bees, which ingest nectar 
by ‘dipping’ their tongues, prefer more viscous nectars of 50–60% (reviewed in 
Kim et al., 2011). The evolution of sugar ratios is also closely tied to pollinator 
groups, but other factors, such as plant physiological constraints, may also play 
a role (Abrahamczyk et al., 2017).
Because pollen is the primary source of macronutrients for most bee 
species, its nutritional content can be a major force in shaping the foraging 
patterns and decisions of generalist bees seeking to optimize foraging bouts 
and balance nutritional intake (reviewed in Vaudo et al., 2020). For example, 
when presented with a variety of pollen sources, bumble bee workers more 14 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?

frequently visited plant species with higher pollen protein-to-lipid ratios (Vaudo 
et al., 2016). Oligolectic bees, which are obligate specialists that rely on pollen 
from closely related plants, even further demonstrate the interconnectedness 
between pollen nutrition and pollinator-plant relationships: the pollen of plants 
that host a particular oligolectic bee often have relatively uniform nutritive 
content, and pollen nutrition is thought to be a limiting factor in these obligate 
specializations (Weiner et al., 2010; Vanderplanck et al., 2017).
The properties of pollen can also act as limiting factors that impede pollen 
collection and digestion. The pollen grains of Malvaceae plants (such as cotton 
and okra), for example, are oily, exceptionally large (with grain diameters over 
100 µm), and covered in spines (Roberts and Vallespir, 1978; Gaglianone, 2000). 
While the pollen-collecting scopa of corbiculate generalist bees generally work 
well with most other pollen types, the physical properties of Malvaceae are an 
impediment to efficient pollen packing, and corbiculate bees have difficulty 
collecting such pollen (Vansell, 1944; Buchmann and Shipman, 1990; Vaissière 
and Vinson, 1994; Lunau et al., 2015; but see Konzmann et  al., 2019). Such 
large, sticky pollen is also common in Cucurbitaceae (which includes squash, 
melons, and cucumbers), Convolvulaceae (sweet potato), Onagraceae (evening 
primrose), and Cactaceae (prickly pear) (Roberts and Vallespir, 1978; Danforth 
et al., 2019a). Specialist pollinators that collect pollen from these taxa have 
evolved modified scopal hairs to efficiently collect unwieldy pollen. Oligolectic 
Eucera bees, for example, have widely spaced, smooth scopal hairs to collect 
the large, spiked, and oily pollen of Cucurbita plants (Roberts and Vallespir, 
1978). Pollen’s chemical composition can also limit pollinator visitors: the pollen 
of Asteraceae, Ranunculaceae, Boraginaceae, Fabaceae, and Cucurbitaceae is 
toxic or nutritionally limiting to the larvae of generalist bees, and Asteraceae 
pollen is also often spiny. Unsurprisingly, the specialist pollinators of these 
plants have physiological modifications to digest such pollen (Danforth et al., 
2019b). Pollen properties can thus restrict the diversity of pollinators that can 
access a host plant, and specialist pollinators that evolve mechanisms to 
overcome such physical and chemical impediments gain exclusive access to 
food sources unavailable to many other pollinators.
Other inherent traits of floral rewards can also have ecological effects 
on pollinators. Secondary chemicals, for example, are ubiquitously found in 
nectar and pollen. Though floral secondary chemicals are primarily related to 
attracting pollinators (i.e. pigments and fragrances), defense-related chemicals 
are often expressed in pollen and nectar, sometimes in concentrations similar to 
non-floral tissue (Adler, 2000; Adler and Irwin, 2005; Manson et al., 2012; Cook 
et al., 2013; Stevenson et al., 2017; Palmer-Young et al., 2019). Consumption 
of these floral secondary compounds can have various beneficial effects on 
pollinators: for example, caffeine and nicotine in nectar improve pollinator 
memory of floral rewards (Wright et al., 2013; Baracchi et al., 2017), while a © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 15
variety of floral chemicals ameliorate infections from pathogens and parasites 
(Baracchi et al., 2015; Palmer-Young et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2016; Egan 
et al., 2018). However, at higher concentrations, a range of compounds can 
have deterrent or toxic effects (Detzel and Wink, 1993). Similarly, the nutritional 
content of pollen can have repercussions on pollinator health – in honey bees, 
higher quality pollen diets increase resistance to parasites and regulate the 
development of hypopharyngeal glands and vitellogenin expression in nurse 
bees (Keller et al., 2005; Di Pasquale et al., 2013). The consumption of sunflower 
(Helianthus annus) pollen displays a trade-off between medicinal effects and 
nutrition: while consumption of pollen dramatically reduces infections of 
parasites in bumblebees (Giacomini et al., 2018), monofloral diets of sunflower 
pollen are considered a poor nutritional food source for honey and bumble 
bees (McAulay and Forrest, 2019).
4.3 The co-evolution of plants and pollinators
Certain floral traits, including colors, structures, fragrances, and rewards, can 
be associated with attracting specific pollinators (reviewed in Sheehan et al., 
2012; Rosas-Guerrero et al., 2014). Floral traits that predictably correspond 
to pollinator specificity are referred to as pollination syndromes, though the 
reliability of syndromes in floral ecology and evolution has been debated, 
especially when considering the roles of generalist pollinators (Waser et al., 
1996; Fenster et al., 2004; Ollerton et al., 2009; but see Rosas-Guerrero et al., 
2014). Regardless, it is undeniable that pollinators play a strong role in the 
evolution of their flowering plant partners. Pollinator preference is a strong 
selective force affecting floral traits, driving diversification at several stages 
of the speciation process, and acting synergistically with other pressures and 
evolutionary mechanisms – such as herbivory and genetic constraints – to 
promote reproductive isolation (Schemske and Bradshaw, 1999; Morgan, 2007; 
Kay and Sargent, 2009; van der Niet et al., 2014; Ramos and Schiestl, 2020).
Like all mutualisms, plant–pollinator relationships may be mediated by a 
conflict between two mutualistic partners; i.e. each partner in the interaction 
benefits by reducing the costs of the interaction. Such adaptations by one 
partner to minimize costs can drive reciprocal changes in the other, resulting in 
an ‘arms race’ and directional selection for more extreme traits. Flower nectar 
spurs reflect how this coevolutionary conflict between pollinators and plants 
can bilaterally shape their evolution. Flowers with nectar spurs limit access so 
that only pollinators with sufficiently long tongues can reach floral rewards. 
Selection favors longer nectar spurs because it forces pollinators to optimally 
contact the reproductive organs of the flower. The pollinator, in turn, is subject 
to selective pressure to evolve longer and longer tongues. Darwin famously 
referenced this ‘arms race’ hypothesis after the discovery of the Madagascan 16 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?

orchid Angraecum sesquipidale and its exceptional 22-cm-long nectar spur, 
predicting the existence of a pollinator with an equivalently long tongue 
(reviewed Arditti et al., 2012). (Such a pollinator was conclusively found 22 
years after his death: a hawkmoth aptly named Xanthopan morganii praedicta.) 
Alternatively, in populations where nectar spurs rapidly evolve to be longer, a 
novel mutualism can form as the plants’ original short-tongued pollinators are 
excluded and longer-tongued pollinators become the predominant pollinator 
visitors. Whittall and Hodges (2007) found evidence supporting both scenarios 
in the evolution of nectar spurs and speciation of columbines (Aquilegia spp.).
Instances of cheating in both plants and pollinators further illustrate 
potential conflicts of interest. Nectar larceny occurs when a pollinator takes 
floral rewards without providing any pollination services (reviewed in Irwin et al., 
2010). For example, in the flowers of alfalfa, the stamens and pistil are held under 
tension and must be unfurled or ‘tripped,’ by a visiting bee to be successfully 
pollinated (Fig. 2e; Bohart, 1957). Honey bees, having learned to take nectar 
while avoiding this ‘tripping’ mechanism, act as nectar thieves (Cane, 2002). 
Pollinators can also act as nectar robbers by chewing holes in flowers to access 
nectar (Maloof and Inouye, 2000). In blueberry flowers, honey bees can act as 
‘secondary’ robbers by stealing nectar from holes already chewed into flowers 
by robbing carpenter bees (Free, 1968). Robbing has various reproductive 
consequences for plants, who in response have evolved a suite of defenses 
to deter robbers; for instance, the thickening of calyxes and the allocation of 
secondary compounds in nectar (Irwin et al., 2010). On the other hand, orchids 
(family Orchidaceae) rely on a suite of tactics to deposit pollen on insects while 
minimally investing in floral rewards (Ray and Vendrame, 2018). Some orchid 
species, such as Ophrys apifera, are pollinated solely by male bees or wasps. 
These orchids bear structures that resemble the females of their respective 
pollinators, with many species enhancing the deception by mimicking sex 
pheromones (Schiestl et al., 2000; Bohman et al., 2014). As males attempt to 
mate with the female mimics, pollen is deposited on their bodies. Males then 
complete the pollination process when they are tricked by another orchid and 
deposit the pollen on its stigmas (Ray and Vendrame, 2018).
5 Domestication and its impact on plant–pollinator 
relationships
The development of agriculture was facilitated by human selection that resulted 
in a rapid evolutionary change in cultivated plant and animal species (artificial 
selection). During cultivation, species are further affected by natural selection, 
to some degree, through environmental factors such as resource limitation 
and disturbance. The result of such forces is domestication – the gradual 
geographical and/or genetic isolation of a founding population that eventually © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 17
distinguishes it from its wild relatives (Purugganan and Fuller, 2009; Milla et al., 
2015). An estimated 2500 plant species have undergone domestication to 
some degree (Zeven and de Wit, 1982; Dirzo and Raven, 2003). Some crops 
are domesticated to a light degree, divergent from their wild relatives by only 
a few major traits: for example, the only major genetic changes in African oil 
palms (Elaeis guineensis) relate to kernel development inside fruits (Gepts, 
2004). But some crops, including the world’s major cereals and crops in the 
Cucurbita family, are heavily domesticated and are almost unrecognizable from 
their wild relatives (Fuller et al., 2010; Lira et al., 2016). In this section, we focus 
on food crops; horticultural domestication also has interesting consequences 
for pollinators but is beyond our scope.
5.1 Domestication and its effect on plant traits
Artificial selection leading to domestication often favors traits that ease harvest 
work, increase yield, or enhance flavor and nutrition. Modern wheat (Triticum
spp.) highlights this: it produces 4.63 tons of grain per hectare (Langemeier 
and Yeager, 2019) compared to the 0.5–0.8 t/ha produced by their relatives in 
the Fertile Crescent (Harlan, 1967). In this section, we briefly review commonly 
shared traits in major crops (collectively referred to as the domestication 
syndrome), though we note that crops display a wide array of domesticated 
traits that are not mentioned in this section (Meyer et al., 2012). Crops are 
usually selected to have larger harvest organs: for example, compared to their 
wild relatives, grain crops dedicate up to 60% of their aboveground biomass 
to grains (versus 20–30% typical in wild relatives) and have seeds that are 5–10 
times larger (Evans, 1993). Many crops display relatively compact growth forms 
compared to their wild predecessors, resulting in improved productivity and 
higher densities (Donald, 1968). Maize (Z. mays) grows on a single stem, a stark 
departure from the highly branched growth forms of its wild teosinte (Zea spp.) 
relatives. Domestication shifts many crops toward increased self-fertilization 
(Rick, 1950; Sapir, 2009; Velázquez-López et al., 2018) or a switch to asexual 
vegetative reproduction, such as in bananas and cassava (Simmonds, 1960; 
Elias and McKey, 2000). This increases the ease of propagation and allows for 
crops to exist in areas where their native pollinators may be lacking (Gepts, 
2004). Furthermore, the removal of seeds increases palatability (e.g. bananas). 
Some crops (primarily cereals) are typically nonshattering, as opposed to their 
wild relatives that disperse their seeds at maturity. Such loss or reduction of 
seed dispersal allows for effective harvest by ensuring that crops hold on to 
grains when they ripen (Di Vittori et al., 2019). Finally, the flavor, quality, and 
handling of harvested organs can be improved through reduced defensive 
structures or secondary chemicals that are toxic or antinutritive (Vanderborght, 
1983; Benrey et al., 1998; Wilson and Dufour, 2002; Gols et al., 2008; Sujana 18 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
et al., 2012; Olsen and Wendel, 2013). The domestication of Cucurbita, for 
example, resulted in the decrease of toxic and bitter substances in the fruit and 
the reduction of silicified hairs in the leaves, stems, and fruit (Lira et al., 2016).
5.2 Domestication and its effect and plant-animal interactions
Gepts (2004) describes humans and crop plants in a ‘mutualistic’ relationship 
– crops have transformed the trajectory of human development, and in 
turn, crop plants have been propagated far beyond their native ranges 
but at a physiological cost. In transforming crops to favor harvest and yield, 
domestication often reduces their resilience, and many crops are unable to 
survive without human upkeep (Gepts, 2004; Purugganan and Fuller, 2011). 
Artificial selection is propagated through multiple genetic bottlenecks, and 
consequently crops are much less genetically diverse than their wild relatives 
(van de Wouw et al., 2010; Meyer et al., 2012).
Crop fitness is also affected by changing dynamics of their natural enemies. 
Cultivated plants are less herbivore-resistant than their wild counterparts 
(Whitehead et al., 2017) and are often subject to intense pressure from 
herbivore pests (reviewed in Macfadyen and Bohan, 2010; Chen et al., 2015). 
Increased vulnerability to herbivores may be the consequence of several 
outcomes of domestication: lower genetic diversity; human selection against 
distasteful, antinutritive, or unwieldy defensive structures and compounds; 
and increased quality and nutrition of harvested organs that herbivores favor 
(Newell-McGloughlin, 2008). Domestication-induced changes in secondary 
chemicals can even deter natural enemies of crop herbivores: unlike their wild 
relatives, domesticated maize and cabbage do not produce volatile attractants 
of parasitoid wasps and entomopathogenic nematodes (Gouinguené et al., 
2001; Köllner et al., 2008; Gols et al., 2011).
Many harvest organs of crops are flower-derived (e.g. fruits, nuts, grains, 
or flowers themselves), and strong selection can alter floral traits from their 
ancestral states. Fruit quality traits such as size, color, and antioxidant content 
are targeted during artificial selection (Kalt et al., 2001). Plants that are 
harvested for their flowers tend to have larger or different-colored flowers: 
many cultivars of domesticated sunflowers, for example, grow taller and have 
larger flower heads (Heiser, 1978). Major reproductive structures can also 
be changed: domesticated tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) and cowpeas 
(Vigna ungiculata) have shortened styles and stigmas, perhaps associated with 
higher inbreeding and more reliable fruit setting (Rick and Dempsey, 1969; 
Lush, 1979); while domesticated sunflowers used as cut flowers are often bred 
to have cytoplasmic male sterility and thus produce no pollen (Heiser, 1978). 
Furthermore, selection for larger fruits often relates to selection for larger flower 
traits – several floral morphological traits of domesticated squash (Cucurbita© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 19
spp.) were larger than their wild relatives (Glasser, 2020). Finally, the chemicals 
of flowers themselves may also be affected – plant-wide differences in volatile 
chemical profiles are responsible for the distinct flavors of different basil 
cultivars (Ocimum spp.) (Dudai and Belanger, 2008; Muráriková et al., 2017).
Domestication can affect a plant’s relationships with its herbivores, but 
do similar altered dynamics occur between crops and their pollinators? This 
would be expected, especially for specialist pollinators that heavily rely on 
their crop partners. For instance, squash and its relatives (Cucurbita spp.) are all 
monoecious and self-incompatible, relying heavily on pollinators to reproduce. 
The oligolectic squash bee Eucera pruinosa relies solely on the pollen of 
Cucurbita plants, and its expansion out of Mexico into temperate North America 
closely coincides with the domestication and subsequent wide-range cultivation 
of squash, pumpkins, and gourds in the Holocene (López-Uribe et al., 2016). 
Floral architecture is paramount in plant–pollinator dynamics, and changes in 
the floral structures of crops can also alter their ecological roles. For example, 
the taller growth forms and enlarged floral heads of domesticated sunflowers 
increase the likelihood of visitation from large- and medium-sized bees (Sapir, 
2009). Changes in secondary chemicals are the most common modifications 
associated with domestication (Meyer et al., 2012) and such alterations can 
affect pollinator-plant relationships. Pollen and nectar of cultivated blueberry 
plants (Vaccinium corymbosum) had markedly different chemical compositions 
than floral rewards of wild V. corymbosum (Egan et al., 2018). Furthermore, 
these differences could have consequences on pollinator health: while nectar 
from both wild and domesticated blueberries contained 4-O-caffeoylshikimic 
acid, a compound effective against the bumble bee parasite Crithidia bombi, 
only wild blueberries contained the compound in sufficient concentrations 
to reduce infections in bees. To our knowledge, these studies are the only 
published work directly measuring the effects of domestication on pollinators, 
and more work must be done to elucidate the influence of crop domestication 
on pollinator dynamics.
6 How do pollinators impact agriculture?
In terms of total production volume, 60% of the world’s crops (mostly grains 
and root crops) are not pollinator-dependent (IPBES, 2016). However, insect 
pollinators are crucial to the production of 70% of the world’s 124 main cultivated 
crops (about 35% of total agricultural output), including high commodity 
crops such as oilseed rape, cocoa, and coffee, which are worth an estimated 
100–351 billion USD per year (Delaplane and Mayer, 2000; Klein et al., 2007; 
Aizen et al., 2009; Lautenbach et al., 2012; Regan et al., 2015; Potts et al., 2016; 
IPBES, 2016). Pollinator-dependent crops are a key source of micronutrients, 
including vitamins A and C, calcium, fluoride, and folic acid (Smith et al., 2015). 20 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?

Furthermore, the economic benefit of pollination continues to rise each year 
since 1995 (Klein et al., 2007; Aizen et al., 2009; Lautenbach et al., 2012).
Pollinators may increase yield through multiple mechanisms. Pollinators can 
increase a plant’s fruit set, the proportion of the plant’s flowers that successfully 
develop into mature fruits or seeds. Increased outcrossing through pollination 
can also increase the size, attractiveness, uniformity, and quality of crops (Klatt 
et al., 2014; Cusser et al., 2016), as well as reducing the time to harvest. Reduced 
pollinator activity can often translate to decreased yield (Ashman et al., 2004; 
Benjamin and Winfree, 2014; Reilly et al., 2020). 
Wild pollinators in or around agricultural land can provide pollination 
services to the crops they visit. However, pollinators are often managed and 
purposefully introduced in agricultural land to enhance pollination. While 
other non-bee insects contribute significantly to the pollination of several 
agricultural crops (Rader et al., 2016), bees are by far the most ubiquitous and 
commonly managed pollinators. The western honey bee (Apis mellifera) – with 
its high densities, history of domestication, and ease of management – is the 
most widely managed pollinator used to improve crop yield globally (National 
Research Council, 2007) and is present on every continent except Antarctica 
(Whitfield et al., 2006). A. mellifera can supplement the production of 96% of 
the world’s major crops, with yield increases as high as 90% in some crops 
(Southwick and Southwick, 1992; Klein et al., 2007) and may even supplement 
the pollination services to surrounding wild plants (Klein et al., 2007). Other 
honey bees, such as the eastern honey bee (A. cerana), are also managed 
due to their resistance to certain pathogens and pesticides. Bumble bees (e.g.
Bombus terrestris and B. impatiens) are much easier to use in enclosed spaces 
and are employed in the greenhouse production of a variety of fruits and 
vegetables, such as tomatoes and cucurbits (Velthuis and van Doorn, 2006). 
Solitary bee species are also used for specialty crop production; for example, 
the leafcutter bee Megachile rotunda is primarily managed for alfalfa, 
blueberry, and clover production, and mason bees (Osmia spp.) are managed 
for a variety of orchard crops, including almonds and cherries (Delaplane and 
Mayer, 2000). Finally, Nomia melanderi is the only solitary ground-nesting bee 
that is intensely managed for agriculture; it is used to pollinate alfalfa in the 
western United States (Cane, 2002).
Crop pollination by wild pollinators is a significant ecosystem service 
to agriculture. Wild bees, for example, can complement pollination services 
provided by managed pollinators, improving production and yield (Morandin 
and Winston, 2005; Greenleaf and Kremen, 2006; Winfree et al., 2007; Garibaldi 
et al., 2013; Mallinger et al., 2015, 2019; Nicholson and Ricketts, 2019; Reilly et al., 
2020). Pollination by wild pollinators can compensate for losses in pollination 
services associated with declines in managed pollinators (Winfree et al., 2007) and 
provide equivalent or greater pollination than managed pollinators (MacKenzie © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 21
and Winston, 1984; Garibaldi et al., 2013; Mallinger et al., 2015, 2019; Averill 
et al., 2018; Reilly et al., 2020). Wild pollinators can often provide sufficient 
pollination without the use of managed pollinators (Winfree et al., 2007; Reilly 
et al., 2020), and in such cases the addition of managed pollinators can result in 
pollen saturation, with increasingly negligible or even negative effects on yield 
(Chacoff et al., 2008; Morris et al., 2010; Garibaldi et al., 2011). Furthermore, 
the reliance on a few managed bee species to produce pollination-dependent 
crops is risky, tying a third of global crop production to a few managed bee 
species (Klein et al., 2007). Wild pollinator species are also in decline, especially 
in agricultural lands (Kevan et al., 1990; Potts et al., 2010; Garibaldi et al., 
2011). While threatened bee species are rarely seen on crops and only a few 
wild pollinator species provide significant pollination services, the abundance 
of wild species that benefit yield is improved by management strategies that 
promote wild pollinator diversity overall (Kleijn et al., 2015). Wild pollinator 
diversity can also have synergistic effects on managed pollinators, increasing the 
effectiveness of their pollination (Brittain et al., 2013). Thus, promoting a diverse 
assemblage of wild pollinators serves the dual benefit of preserving biodiversity 
and increasing the efficiency of overall pollinator services (Burkle et al., 2017).
The relationship between agriculture and pollinators is deeply intertwined, 
and a loss of pollinators compromises the many benefits of pollination services. 
In the United States, a substantial portion of pollinator-dependent crops (39% of 
pollinator-dependent crop area) already lacks sufficient pollinator populations 
to fill the demand for pollinator services (Koh et al., 2016). The absence of 
pollinators would result in a 40–90% decrease in production for 91 of the world’s 
124 leading crops (IPBES, 2016), an associated economic loss of about US$200 
billion annually (Gallai et al., 2009), and a wildly disproportionate increase in 
the amount of land used for crop production; these effects will be of a greater 
magnitude in the developing world (Aizen et al., 2009). Hand-pollinated crops 
highlight the potential difficulties imposed by future pollinator losses – crops 
such as vanilla bean and oil palms require intense, time-consuming labor, 
often resulting in higher costs for consumers and poor working conditions 
for laborers (Wurz et al., 2021). The loss of pollination services would threaten 
global food security, and resulting deficiencies in macronutrient availability 
are estimated to increase global non-communicable and malnutrition-related 
deaths by 1.7 million annually (Tscharntke et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2015). Finally, 
pollinator decline is a threat to invaluable cultural institutions and practices that 
are dependent on pollinators (Potts et al., 2016; Dicks et al., 2021).
7 Modern agriculture and pollinators
The meteoric increase in human population in the mid-twentieth century was 
sustained by an equivalently rapid intensification of the world’s food production. 22 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?

In 1960, global grain production was 1 billion tons, but in a mere 40 years, that 
figure had doubled (Khush, 2001). This so-called green revolution was facilitated 
by revolutionary agricultural technologies, including the development of high￾yielding crop varieties, efficient irrigation, and increased use of agrochemicals 
(Matson et al., 1997; Khush, 2001). While recent agricultural intensification has 
prevented widespread famine in an increasingly populated world, it has also had 
serious consequences on ecosystems in and around agricultural lands (Matson 
et al., 1997; Ricketts et al., 2008). One such consequence is pollinator decline 
– global losses in wild insect pollinator abundance and diversity (Powney et al., 
2019; van Klink et al., 2020; Wagner, 2020) and increased colony mortality in 
managed pollinators (vanEngelsdorp et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2010). While 
pollinator decline is a multifaceted issue with many causal factors, agriculture 
and its landscape effects have been implicated as key (Kremen et al., 2002; 
Ollerton et al., 2014; IPBES, 2016; Dicks et al., 2021). In this section, we briefly 
discuss some of these factors; subsequent chapters will review individual 
threats to pollinators in depth. Furthermore, detailed reviews are provided in 
González-Varo et al., 2013; Potts et al., 2016; and Dicks et al., 2021.
7.1 Land use and management
A body of evidence has linked the global intensification of human land use 
and its environmental consequences as a major contributor to pollinator 
decline (Kennedy et al., 2013; Basu et al., 2016; Kovács-Hostyánszki et al., 
2017). In 2015, approximately 19.3 million km2 of land was used for crop 
production, comprising about 14.7% of Earth’s terrestrial surface. Total 
agricultural land (cropland and pastures) covered 54.3 million km2, or 41.2% 
of Earth’s land (Ellis et al., 2020). Agricultural land is only expected to increase 
further, with expected increases of about 10% of current ranges by 2030 
(Tilman et al., 2001; Haines-Young, 2009). Much of this new agricultural land 
will likely be created at the expense of uninhabited wildlands or through 
intensified use of currently inhabited landscapes (Ellis et al., 2020). The 
resulting habitat loss can disrupt pollination networks by limiting resources, 
foraging sites, and brood sites for pollinators (Potts et al., 2010; Roulston 
and Goodell, 2011; Baude et al., 2016). Human disturbance has generally 
reduced the richness and abundance of pollinator communities (Taki et al., 
2007; Ricketts et al., 2008; Steffan-Dewenter and Schiele, 2008; Spiesman and 
Inouye, 2013; Connelly et al., 2015); although the intensity of these effects 
can vary among different pollinator groups (Sjödin et al., 2007; Traveset 
et al., 2018). Furthermore, the large-scale planting of one or two crops, or 
monocultures, simplifies the landscape around them and decreases pollinator 
foraging resources, especially during periods when crops are not in bloom 
(Tscharntke et al., 2005; Kremen and Miles, 2012). Landscape simplification © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture? 23
can also decrease the pollination services provided by pollinators (Connelly 
et al., 2015) and have physiological effects: when the plant species diversity 
is limited, or only suboptimal resources are available, bees can experience 
nutritional stress that impacts their body size, population sizes, pathogen 
loads, immunocompetence, microbiota, and fertility (Carvell et al., 2006; 
Renauld et al., 2016; Parreño et al., 2021). 
7.2 Pathogens and pesticides
Pathogens are attributed as another major force in pollinator decline 
(vanEngelsdorp et al., 2008; Goulson et al., 2015; Dicks et al., 2021); the 
impacts of diseases on pollinators will be further discussed elsewhere in this 
volume. In this section, we briefly review the impact of pathogen spillover. In 
generalist pathogens that infect multiple hosts, some host species display 
higher resistance or tolerance and can thus be ‘reservoirs’ of infection that 
maintain high pathogen prevalence. Such reservoir species can then spread 
the pathogen to other hosts; this phenomenon is called pathogen spillover
(Daszak et al., 2000; Power and Mitchell, 2004). With the increased use of 
managed pollinators, evidence has shown that they can serve as pathogen 
reservoirs, spreading the infection to wild conspecifics (Graystock et al., 2013, 
2015). Managed bumble bees used in greenhouses, for example, can serve as 
reservoirs for the gut parasites C. bombi and Nosema bombi, spreading the 
pathogens to wild bumble bee populations, who can then radiate the infection 
away from the source (Colla et al., 2006; Krömer et al., 2008; Otterstatter and 
Thomson, 2008; Graystock et al., 2013; Murray et al., 2013; Schmid-Hempel 
et al., 2014). A. mellifera is another prime candidate for a reservoir species: it is 
widely distributed, dwells in dense colonies, is highly mobile due to migratory 
beekeeping operations, and can host a range of pathogens that can infect other 
Apoidea species (Fürst et al., 2014; Ravoet et al., 2014; Goulson and Hughes, 
2015; Glenny et al., 2017).
Concerningly, pathogen spread in pollinators is not limited to conspecifics. 
Bumble bees can spread the neogregarine parasite Apicystis bombi to honey 
bees, while a wide variety of pathogens, including N. ceranae, deformed 
wing virus, and black queen cell virus, can be transmitted from honey bees to 
bumble bees (Otterstatter and Whidden, 2004; Goka et al., 2006; Chen and 
Siede, 2007; Plischuk et al., 2009; Graystock et al., 2014; McMahon et al., 2015). 
Honey bee-specific diseases, including Varroa destructor mites, can spread from 
A. mellifera to other Apidae species (Plischuk and Lange, 2009; Guzman-Novoa 
et al., 2015; Manley et al., 2015; Purkiss and Lach, 2019; but see Gusachenko 
et al., 2020). Furthermore, evidence on the effects of pathogen spillover 
from managed bees to native bees is overwhelmingly negative (reviewed in 
Mallinger et al., 2017).24 What is pollination and what are pollinators in agriculture?

The impacts of pesticide use have further compounded the pressure 
imposed by pathogens (vanEngelsdorp et al., 2008; Sanchez-Bayo and Goka, 
2014; Goulson et al., 2015) and will be discussed in detail elsewhere in this 
volume. In brief, herbicides can reduce floral abundance and biodiversity of 
flowers in agricultural landscapes (Albrecht et al., 2007), while insecticides can 
cause a variety of direct effects on pollinators even at sublethal doses (reviewed 
in Sanchez-Bayo and Goka, 2014) and reduce pollinator abundance and 
species richness (Brittain et al., 2010; Mallinger et al., 2015; Woodcock et al., 
2017; Main et al., 2020).
7.3 Introductions of non-native bee species
Humans have inadvertently increased the range of managed pollinator species 
by introducing them to agricultural systems outside of their native ranges. Honey 
bees are established all over the world except Antarctica and are arguably the 
most widely distributed species after humans (Goulson and Hughes, 2015). 
Outside of western honey bees, Bombus terrestris was the earliest managed 
pollinator released outside of its native range, introduced in New Zealand in 
1886 and 1906 to assist in the production of red clover. In 1982, New Zealand 
populations of B. terrestris were used as a source for an introduction in Chile 
(Arretz and Macfarlane, 1986). The species then spread to Argentina, and today 
its range is expanding northward and southward (Schmid-Hempel et al., 2014). 
This introduction resulted in the widespread and precipitous decline of the 
native B. dahlbombi. More generally, B. terrestris became widespread after its 
popularity in greenhouse production; its escape from greenhouses established 
them in Japan, for example (Inoue et al., 2008). In North America, escaped B. 
impatiens from managed greenhouse colonies have been established in the 
Pacific Northwest and are expanding their range (Looney et al., 2019).
8 Conclusion
The mutualism between flowering plants and their pollinators is deeply 
intertwined: outcrossing flowering plants rely on pollinators to reproduce, and 
pollinators are provided with resources to survive and proliferate. Humanity 
is similarly dependent on crop plants; human society and its ever-increasing 
advancement are primarily fueled by agriculture. Humans are thus indebted to 
pollinators, and indeed, pollination ecosystem services have aided humanity 
even before the inception of agriculture – when humans relied on fruit from 
wild pollinator-dependent plants. But in recent decades, exponential human 
population growth has placed greater demand on agricultural production, with 
the potential to strain relationships between crops and pollinators. Mitigating

strategies on agricultural lands are necessary to safeguard pollinators in the 
face of agricultural intensification. The remainder of this book is dedicated 
to recent advances in understanding and preserving relationships that link 
humans, crops, and pollinators. Promoting pollinators and maintaining sufficient 
production to sustain human population growth are not mutually exclusive 
goals. In fact, both interests can be fittingly mutualistic: humans can quite 
literally reap the rewards from the services that healthy pollinator communities 
provide (Kleijn et al., 2015).
9 Where to look for further information
The Natural History of Pollination is a summary of the mechanisms that drive 
pollination, covering the floral adaptations of plants, the diversity of animals 
that pollinate plants, the evolution of plant–pollinator relationships, and much 
more. While the book is over 20 years old, it is still an excellent resource to 
begin understanding the rich relationships between flowering plants and the 
pollinators on which they rely. (https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the
-natural-history-of-pollination-collins-new-naturalist-library-book-83-michael

The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 
has published a detailed report that covers the importance of pollinators for 
global food production, pollinator decline and its drivers, and suggestions to 
policymakers for addressing risks and improving conditions for pollinators in 
agroecosystems. It is also an excellent source for papers regarding such topics: 
https://ipbes.net/assessment-reports/pollinators.
Finally, the US Department of Agriculture publishes an annual Strategic 
Pollinator Priorities and Goals Report. These reports synthesize current 
pollinator research and feedback from stakeholders and identify key priorities 
for promoting pollinators in agroecosystems. The most recent report (at the 
time of writing) can be accessed here: https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files

1 Introduction
Pollination by animals, especially insects, is important to the production of 
around three in four crops (Klein et al., 2007). Critical to this ecosystem service 
are the individual-level interactions between plants and their pollen vectors. 
The primary benefit of this interaction for the pollinator is obtaining a food 
reward, although in some plant families (and often through chemical deception) 
flower visitors also anticipate an opportunity to reproduce (Urru et al., 2011). 
Plants have developed mechanisms to distinguish themselves from others and 
attract an effective pollinator. In turn, pollinators must efficiently detect and 
decipher plant cues to compete for potentially limited resources. In this chapter 
we discuss some of the mechanisms that are important in underpinning these 
interactions in pollination systems and how understanding and manipulating 
these processes could contribute to more sustainable crop production.

1.1 Key issues
Other chapters have discussed the importance of pollination in agriculture and 
some of the constraints challenging pollen vectors. Recognition of a flower by 
a pollinator depends upon multimodal cues including odour. Understanding 
the role played by odour in crop pollination, how it can be manipulated and 
what might limit it could help establish sustainable pollination services in crop 
production. Some important considerations include:
• How attractive are the volatiles of crop flowers, and is pollination efficacy 
based on attractiveness per se?
• Has crop domestication influenced crop floral odours, and what are the 
implications of this?
• Which crops are most reliant on pollinators that orient or select flowers 
primarily via scent?
• Can the use of odour cues by pollinators be manipulated to increase visit 
frequency or efficacy, with the aim of improving fruit set?
• Can other non-floral odours enhance pollination?
1.2 How and why plants produce floral odours
Flowers of crops and wild plants produce odours primarily to communicate 
with pollinators, encouraging more visits and thus more pollen transfer, 
essential for fruit and seed set. Floral odour production can also confer wider 
benefits, such as selecting for specific pollinators or deterring herbivores, and 
in ornamentals, may be selected to please human consumers. The odour – 
usually a blend of compounds – is detected by a potential pollinator (normally 
with the antennae in the case of insects) and the pollinator uses this, along 
with other cues, to locate the flower and approach it. The effectiveness of floral 
odours at attracting pollinators is under the influence of environmental factors 
such as wind speed and direction and temperature; the result is that the odour 
does not disperse uniformly in all directions away from the source but moves 
according to air currents and can meander (Brady et al., 1990). Therefore, the 
detectability of a crop’s floral odour to potential pollinators is influenced by the 
wider context, not just the plant’s physiology and genetics and the identity of 
the pollinator. The effectiveness of agricultural technologies that use artificial or 
synthetic odour blends to manipulate pollinator attraction to crop flowers are 
similarly also susceptible to these environmental variations.
While some pollinators are innately attracted to specific volatile 
compounds (e.g. midges orient towards the odour blend containing extract 
from the headspace of cacao flowers (Arnold et al., 2019)), for many pollinators 
the exact nature of the odour is less important than the learned experience and © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions 49
associated or expected benefits. For example, generalist bumblebees such as 
Bombus terrestris will learn to visit flowers or other targets providing a food 
reward bearing a range of odours, from pleasant (e.g. peppermint or linalool) 
to less pleasant odours, as long as the cue is associated with an energetic or 
other reward (Sommerlandt et al., 2014). Naïve bees of various species do have 
innate preferences for some odours more than others (Haber et al., 2021) but 
almost any compound can be learned in association with food. Alternatively, 
some insects including bumblebees and wasps may be attracted to deceptive 
flowers emitting odours that mimic sex pheromones. In that case, the plants are 
presenting a strongly innate cue that may be difficult to avoid or adapt against 
because the pollinators depend upon responding to it in order to secure 
copulation.
Consequently, it is not possible to suggest a single, optimal odour 
composition for a crop flower to emit to maximise pollination. Which odours can 
assist in promoting flower visitation depends on the species of insect (or other 
organism) that pollinate it, the wider environmental context, including which 
other plant species are in flower and what the pollinators’ prior experience may 
have included.
However, a distinctive scent may benefit a crop plant, in a similar way 
to the role of floral colour and shape which are under selective pressure to 
make flowers distinguishable from each other within a community, allowing 
pollinators to discriminate among them. In a crop, mass flowering may produce 
a more profound cue that can attract potential pollinators from further away, 
because of the scale of odour emission. Alternatively, mass of flowering crop 
plants may require much lower levels of floral odour emission per flower than 
flowers in complex communities owing to the abundance of distinguishing 
compounds.
Floral volatiles are usually produced as secondary metabolic by-products 
from pathways deriving from primary metabolism, mainly the Calvin cycle. 
Benzenoid and phenylpropanoid compounds are produced via the shikimate 
pathway; terpenoids come from the MEP pathway derived from pyruvate 
(Muhlemann et al., 2014). They are usually emitted directly from epidermal 
cells in the flower. However, different parts of the flower can emit different 
odour compounds – for example, the nectar of courgette (Cucurbita pepo
var. Tosca, Chapin, Consul) emits high levels of 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene and 
1,4-dimethoxybenzene, but the petals, stigma and anthers do not; similarly, the 
anthers emit far more linalool and eucalyptol per mass unit compared to the 
stigmas (Mena Granero et al., 2005).
Some volatile organic compounds (VOCs) occur widely in floral odours 
(Table 1) whereas some crop flowers have distinctive and unusual flower 
bouquets, such as cacao (Arnold et al., 2019), which emits various straight￾chain unsaturated hydrocarbons. In cacao these compounds may distinguish 50 Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions

the flowers for pollinating Ceratopogonid midges. In orchids, alkenes are 
proposed to be a preadaptation in the evolution of deceptive odours (Schiestl 
and Cozzolino, 2008). Serapia orchids produce a range of long-chain alkanes 
that differ qualitatively among closely related species and may have a more 
direct influence on pollinator attraction (Pellegrino et al., 2012).
Selective breeding alters the odour composition of crops, such that 
modern cultivars may differ significantly from wild relatives. This could include

gain-of-volatile, but unless the selective breeding specifically selects for odour 
or pollinator attractiveness, loss-of-volatile is a risk. There is considerable cultivar￾specific variation among crop floral volatiles, which can impact attractiveness 
to pollinators (Klatt et al., 2013; Ceuppens et al., 2015). Enhancing pollination 
via odour lures should therefore consider whether the lure is simply fulfilling a 
function that in other cultivars would be done more effectively by the flower.
1.3 Intraspecific variation in floral volatiles in crops and crop 
relatives
The scent of a flower, including a crop flower, can vary within a species, over 
time and space, between subspecies and cultivars, the physiological condition 
of the plant, and between male and female flowers on the same plant.
1.3.1 Dioecious flower volatiles
Some species of plant, including some crops (cucurbits) and crop relatives 
(Ficus spp., Fragaria virginiana), possess separate male and female (or male/
hermaphrodite or female/hermaphrodite) flowers either on the same or 
separate plants. Where these plants are insect pollinated, they may employ 
mimicry to ensure visits of pollinators to both sexes of flower, raising the 
question of whether visually similar male and female flowers also possess the 
same volatile composition. While overlaps in the major compounds present 
often occur (Ervik et al., 1999; Grison-Pigé et al., 2001), it is common for flowers 
of different sexes to have measurable differences in volatile composition or 
abundance (Ervik et al., 1999; Grison-Pigé et al., 2001; Ashman et al., 2005). 
This can affect their attractiveness to insect pollinators (Ashman et al., 2005).
1.3.2 Spatio-temporal variability
The Araceae, which includes some important crop species such as taro, 
cocoyam and Mexican breadfruit, includes many species with sapromyophilous 
flowers that attract carrion insects and flowers that attract coprophilous species. 
Such flowers commonly produce compounds that smell like the usual food 
site, typically rotting meat or dung, of the pollinating insects, most commonly 
Diptera. For example, oligo dimethyl sulphides are produced in Titan Arum 
(Amorphophallus titanum) (Kite and Hetterschieid, 1997). Arum maculatum
is pollinated by female Psychoda phalaenoides (in Western/Central Europe) 
and both sexes of both P. phalaenoides and Psychoda grisescens flies in 
other regions (Gfrerer et al., 2021). It produces a hyperdiverse assemblage of 
compounds including indole and p-cresol which are also found in cow dung, 
the normal breeding microhabitat of the pollinator (Kite, 1995). A. maculatum52 Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions

floral odour varies across time and space and shows considerable variation 
within- and among-populations which have been proposed to be adaptations to 
distinct species of Psychoda (Gfrerer et al., 2021; Szenteczki et al., 2021). Both P. 
phalaenoides and P. grisescens have overlapping brood-site preferences (cow 
dung), but P. phalaenoides also uses sewage whereas P. grisescens does not 
(Satchell, 1947); so the A. maculatum odour variation may conceivably reflect 
differences in the substrate uses of the local species.
Floral odour variation in crops that are pollinator dependent can be 
influenced by the conflicting need to protect the plant and flower against 
damaging herbivory. For example, strawberry flower odours contain a range 
of compounds including green leaf volatiles that are associated with defence 
and those cultivars producing higher amounts of those compounds are visited 
less by bumble bees than cultivars producing lower amounts (Ceuppens et al., 
2015). In elder (Sambucus nigra), visitation by Thrips major is mediated by 
changing concentrations of floral volatiles including linalool that attract the 
pollinating thrips with peaks in abundance coinciding with pollen dehiscence 
and then declining after pollination to be replaced by deterrent cyanogenic 
glycosides, prunasin and sambunigrin (Scott-Brown et al., 2019). This example 
is discussed in further detail as a case study.
Spatio-temporal variation in floral odours within plants is common but 
association with pollinator-mediated selection is not always clear and other 
ecological explanations such as the role of natural enemies, environmental 
constraints, phylogenetic inertia or biochemical constraints could be drivers 
of variation (Delle-Vedove et al., 2017). That said, there are examples of plant–
pollinator interactions, especially with specialists, where floral odours attract 
pollinators (Milet-Pinheiro et al., 2013). However, these may be examples of 
pollinators adapting to floral cues associated with good reward rather than 
flowers producing odours for which pollinators have innate attraction. Floral 
odours enhance short-term pollinator specificity which benefits both pollinator 
and plant and influences the evolution of plant systems of reproduction by 
influencing floral visitation by pollinators (Wright and Schiestl, 2009).
1.4 Pollinator detection of floral odours
Most pollinators are insects and thus detect odours with their antennae. Within 
the insect brain, the mushroom bodies and antennal lobes play important roles 
in olfactory learning (Hu et al., 2010; Carcaud et al., 2016). The antennae have 
sensillae, chemical-sensitive cells, that are specific to a single compound or a 
set of closely related structures. In the case of vertebrate pollinators, the role of 
odour can vary from minor in birds to intense in rodents and bats (Bestmann 
et al., 1997; von Helversen et al., 2000; Fleming et al., 2009; Dellinger 
et al., 2019). Relatively few crop flowers are pollinated by vertebrates (the main © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions 53
examples are fruits such as dragon fruit and durian, and also Parkia spp. beans 
(Piechowski et al., 2010; Ratto et al., 2018)), but in cases where the pollinator is 
nocturnal or has poor eyesight, odour can play a key role in ensuring pollination 
(Ratto et al., 2018).
1.4.1 Assessing the ability of an insect to detect crop floral 
odours and respond to them
Electro-antennography (EAG), especially when coupled with mass spectroscopy 
(GC-EAG, also known as GC-EAD) enables researchers to evaluate an insect’s 
ability to detect the individual components of an odour blend taken from a 
headspace extraction from a crop flower. While EAG tests the response of 
the antenna overall, single-sensillum recording will indicate the presence and 
activity of individual chemical-sensitive cells on an insect’s antenna. Similar 
electrophysiology can take place on other organs involved in chemoreception, 
such as tarsae and mouthparts. However, although electrophysiological studies 
can provide information about whether an odour is detectable to an insect, 
they reveal nothing about the ecological significance of specific volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs). A detectable odour could induce attraction, deterrence, 
gustation, oviposition, aggression or can elicit different behaviours depending 
on context, concentration and the other volatiles present.
Once it has been established that an insect can detect specific floral 
volatiles, behavioural assay methods can permit evaluation of the insect’s 
responses to it. Various apparatus can be employed, including Y-tube and 
four-arm olfactometers, wind tunnels, feeding and flight arenas, and Y-mazes 
(Ceuppens et al., 2015; Solís-Montero et al., 2018). These allow the insect to 
make choices about where they choose to orient and land, providing insight into 
what they consider most attractive both with and without learning experience, 
and the data collected provide a starting point for determining attraction.
1.5 How insects learn about floral odours and the relevance to 
crops
Most insects pollinating crop flowers are not naïve to flowers. They are 
experienced foragers who have visited and sampled a range of flowers. Their 
decision to visit the crop in some cases may be based on instinct or innate 
attraction as is assumed to be the case for cocoa midges (Arnold et al., 2019) 
or Elaeidobius kamerunicus (Adaigbe et al., 2011), the pollinator of oil palm. In 
the case of insects showing sophisticated learning abilities such as generalist 
bees and hawkmoths, the decision to visit the crop is fine-tuned based on 
previous rewarding experiences with those flowers (Riffell et al., 2008; Wright 
and Schiestl, 2009). Where an insect receives nectar or pollen from the flower, 54 Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions

it forms a memory association between that reward and the cues associated 
with the flower, including its specific odour, and will seek out that odour more 
often in future. This benefits the plant, particularly for pollinators with relatively 
high floral constancy, because they will visit many conspecific flowers and thus 
transfer more conspecific pollen. Because distinctive and memorable odours 
are beneficial in this interaction (Wright and Schiestl, 2009), in addition to those 
that are innately attractive, more complex and recognisable floral blends may 
be favoured. Indeed, crop cultivars with more simplified odour composition 
can be associated with reduced visitation rates even from pollinators that learn 
well (Ceuppens et al., 2015). Similarly, reliable odours that do not vary too 
much within a species will favour more rapid learning and constancy (Wright 
and Schiestl, 2009).
Social insects also learn about floral odours in the nest. As nectar often 
bears the scent of the flower, nectar brought back to the nest will be consumed 
by other workers in the colony apart from the forager who collected it, thereby 
forming an odour-memory association without a direct flower visit. This can 
influence foraging preference outside the nest in stingless bees (Reichle et al., 
2010), honeybees (Farina et al., 2007) and bumblebees (Molet et al., 2009).
1.5.1 Context-specific use of odour information
Where a pollinator also interacts with a plant at other points in the insect’s 
life cycle, it may respond to odour volatiles present in the floral headspace, 
but in a different way according to the different context. Mated and unmated 
insects, insects under nutritional stress versus those that are satiated, and 
newly eclosed versus senescent individuals, respond differently to odour cues. 
Aphidophagous hoverflies may use plant wound volatiles and aphid alarm 
pheromones as oviposition cues (James, 2003; Yu et al., 2008). Some of those 
odours conceivably may also attract individuals towards the plant for flower￾visiting purposes, but this cannot be assumed without testing. Therefore, efforts 
to develop volatile attractants for hoverflies need to be mindful that a lure blend 
to stimulate attraction to the crop for oviposition may not function effectively 
to promote flower-visiting. Equally, a lure blend derived from oviposition 
behaviours may be wholly unattractive to male insects and have no influence 
on their tendency to visit the crop of interest.
2 Key challenges
2.1 Anthropogenic disturbance of pollination
Anthropogenic drivers of environmental change, especially large-scale habitat 
loss and global climate change, are implicated in pollinator declines (Powney © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions 55
et al., 2019) with severe implications for plants which rely wholly on interactions 
with these organisms for reproduction in natural systems (Biesmeijer et al., 
2006) or cropping systems. An insidious effect of such drivers is their potential 
to directly disrupt the fine balance of mutualisms between plants and 
pollinators at a local scale. Such effects are harder to detect than declining 
pollinator abundance or distribution, but may have equivalent impacts on plant 
reproductive success by reducing effective visitation rates.
Although anthropogenic constraints are reviewed in detail elsewhere in 
this book, the reliance of pollination systems on such complex interspecific 
plant-insect signalling mechanisms means that they are highly vulnerable to 
influence by their unique abiotic and biotic environments. Therefore, exploring 
the extent to which anthropogenic activity can influence the odour-based 
interactions between crops and their pollinators is worthy of consideration 
here.
2.1.1 Air: environmental pollution in the form anthropogenic 
volatile pollutants
Anthropogenic volatile pollutants (AVPs) derived from traffic and industrial 
processing activities can disrupt scent-based communication between flowers 
and pollinators (Macgregor and Scott-Brown, 2020). Increased levels of AVPs 
in the environment can disguise floral signals and increase degradation rates 
for floral volatiles (Girling et al., 2013; Fuentes et al., 2016; Cook et al., 2020), 
including ubiquitous scent components such as linalool (McFrederick et al., 
2008), limiting signalling range and ability to decipher. Other pollutants and 
contaminants, particularly pesticidal drift (Williamson and Wright, 2013) and 
heavy metals (Meindl and Ashman, 2013), relevant to agricultural production 
systems can interfere with the pollinators’ ability to detect and learn odours.
2.1.2 Soil: the physiological state of a crop can influence its 
production of floral volatiles
This can relate to factors such as nitrogen enrichment of habitats via atmospheric 
pollution and soil improvement processes exceeded through agricultural 
intensification (Galloway and Cowling, 2002; Fowler et al., 2013), which constitute 
a threat to biodiversity at all trophic levels (PÖyry et al., 2017). Soil nitrogen 
availability influences production and emission of a range of plant volatiles in 
some species, including those involved in plant-insect signalling (Kivimäenpää 
et al., 2016), though evidence of effects on VOCs in the floral scent of crop species 
is still limited (Majetic et al., 2017). Soil inorganic components may also influence 
the abundance and diversity of floral volatiles (Ormeño et al., 2008). However, 56 Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions

studies which specifically examine how these may negatively or positively affect 
interactions between pollen vectors and cultivated plants are few.
2.1.3 Climate and extreme weather events
Numerous studies have focused on the negative effects of climate change and 
extreme weather events on major cash crops and the stability of food production 
systems (Cogato et al., 2019). Although the general effects of elevated global 
temperatures on pollinators and cropping systems are reviewed in more 
detail in a previous chapter, it is important to note here the effect of extreme 
temperatures on the stability of olfactory cues and synchronisation of detection 
of crop plant flowers by their pollinators. To be effective at attracting pollinators, 
first, signals must not be altered or become less attractive under altered 
environments: drought, high precipitation, extreme temperatures (and shifting 
crop phenologies). Given that natural scent production emissions operate by 
increasing respiration rates at higher ambient temperatures, climate warming 
may lead to physiological limits to respiration rates, preventing the continuing 
maintenance of volatile production and altering the efficiency of olfactory 
sensitivity detection as a flower-visitation mechanism. Second, pollinator 
preference may itself change, with flower scents becoming less detectable or 
attractive when conditions change.
2.2 Competition
Few crops have a single specialist pollinating taxon or species (there are 
exceptions such as oil palm, fig, vanilla and arguably cocoa). As a result, it 
is rare that the crop itself is integral to the survival of the pollinator, even 
when pollinator visitors are critical for the crop’s fruit set (though a notable 
exception is the squash bees (Hymenoptera: Eucerini, Peponapis and 
Xenoglossa, which are oligolectic on Cucurbita pollen (Hurd et al., 1971)). 
In the case of most crops, the signals (visual, odour) displayed by the crop 
flowers to appeal to pollinators are competing with those of other plants 
in the surroundings. While there is benefit to the crop from mass flowering 
in presenting a large target area and more intense cues, the crops are still 
in competition with wildflowers (Holzschuh et al., 2011). Where selective 
breeding has unintentionally resulted in dilution or simplification of a crop’s 
odour bouquet, effective pollination may be more of a challenge. Conversely, 
the observation that cocoa is pollinated by locally native Ceratopogonid 
midges wherever the crop has been introduced, even far outside its native 
range, demonstrates that the plasticity of pollinator behaviour can be of great 
benefit to the crop.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

3 Case studies
3.1 Study 1: critical timing for optimisation of pollination in a 
tree crop
Coinciding the timing of the release of floral scent with the foraging activity 
of efficient pollen vectors is crucial for pollination precision, and studies have 
revealed that this energy-efficient strategy exists in many pollinator-reliant 
plant taxa (Hoballah et al., 2005; Prieto-Benítez et al., 2016; Chapurlat et al., 
2018; Powers et al., 2020). In natural systems multiple evolutionary pressures 
on plants and pollinators may determine the optimal timing for the attraction 
of a pollinator via release of floral scent and fertilisation to occur. For example, 
flowers that open at night may avoid pollinator-mediated competition, thus 
reducing the danger of sharing actively foraging pollinators with co-flowering 
species and potentially reducing pollination success (Macgregor and Scott￾Brown, 2020). Competitors for floral rewards may include less efficient pollen￾vectoring organisms and heterospecific pollen collectors (Morales and 
Traveset, 2008), herbivores (e.g. Theis and Adler, 2012; Schiestl, 2015; Nunes 
et al., 2016) and pollinator predators.
Thus, through processes of crop selection and breeding programmes 
and introduction of domesticated cultivars into new geographic ranges, the 
desirable components of floral scent may be downregulated, or timing of 
emissions may mismatch the activity of native pollinator guilds, resulting in less 
successful pollination in the short window of opportunity when plants are fertile. 
Furthermore, in such situations, crop plants may be detected and monopolised 
by ineffective pollinators and potentially destructive florivores.
In cases where crops are sustainably harvested from wild sources or 
landraces are retained there is evidence that crop plants may co-evolve 
partnerships where benefits for production arise. In this context, thrips 
(Thysanoptera) are of interest, with growing evidence that they are brood-site 
pollinators (Sakai, 2002), effective in transferring pollen within species that 
possess adaptations associated with wind pollination, such as many flowers, 
abundant powdery pollen and large stigmas (Tal, 2009). To demonstrate this, 
a recent study addressed the broad question, ‘Do native flower thrips have a 
role as pollinators in UK landscapes?’ Researchers used a combination of field 
and laboratory experiments to examine the behaviour and life cycle of native 
flower thrips, mapping these with changes in floral chemistry throughout the 
flower development stages in European elder, Sambucus nigra (Scott-Brown 
et al., 2019). Elderflower scent emissions containing β-(±)-linalool and (E)-β￾ocimene peaked as the flowers were opening (pre-anthesis stage), while levels 
of these VOCs were reduced or absent at bud and senescence stages, with 
the highest abundance of compounds corresponding with increased numbers 58 Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions

of thrips present in inflorescences. Further, recording the circadian emissions 
from young elderflowers over 24 h demonstrated that the abundance of volatile 
compounds increased between midnight to early morning, attracting the 
thrips to pollen-receptive flowers at night. Thrips, which are characteristically 
brood-site pollinators (Sakai, 2002), produced offspring which remained in 
the elderflowers feeding on pollen until concentrations of specific nitrogen￾storage/defence secondary metabolites (cyanogenic glycosides) increased 
in floral tissues to levels shown to deter the thrips from senescing flowers, 
thereby protecting newly forming fruit. The study additionally used pollinator￾exclusion experiments to confirm thrips’ visitation at the critical point in floral 
development increased the chances of fruit set in this species. In return for 
pollination services, the plant provides thrips with sites for oviposition and a 
food source for developing larvae.
The study provided new insight into the previously ambiguously defined 
pollination strategies of Sambucus nigra, a species in high global demand 
for elderflower syrup, herbal medicines and natural food colouring (Jones, 
2019) and draws attention to gaps in knowledge about the contribution of 
diverse pollinators to primary and secondary agricultural production systems. 
Elucidating olfactory mechanisms which underpin pollinator interactions in 
wild populations may steer future development of new breeding technologies, 
leading to the enhancement of pollination in high-value cropping systems, 
through focused studies on floral volatile organic compound emissions during 
floral development.
3.2 Study 2: caffeine to enhance learning of crop floral odours 
in commercial pollinators
The odours that social bees (both honeybees and bumblebees) encounter in 
their nest can influence their floral targets of choice outside the nest (Molet 
et al., 2009). This implies a mechanism in which the odours of worker-collected 
floral nectar or pollen brought back to the nest are detected by other workers, 
including those not yet actively foraging, and learned in association with food.
Several patents have been produced that seek to harness this process, 
by providing crop-specific floral odour blends to honeybees in the nest, with 
the intention that honeybees would be exposed to the crop floral odours early 
in their adult lives and then depart the nest already with a memory of these 
odours and a positive association. This would, then, be expected to result in 
enhanced forage focus on the crop of interest. Blends exist for apple (Farina 
et al., 2011a,b), pear (Farina and Díaz, 2020), almond (Farina et al., 2020b) and 
sunflower (Farina et al., 2012). There are also products that work using some 
mixture of floral odours and unspecified ‘bee attractants’ (Sasaki et al., 2008) 
that are applied both to the nest and the crop, for soybean (Apicultural Institute © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions 59
of Jilin Province, 2011) and linseed (Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden 
of CAS, 2009).
This can be taken still further. Research over the last decade, building on 
earlier work, has demonstrated that both honeybees and bumblebees have 
behavioural responses to caffeine (Couvillon et al., 2015; Thomson et al., 2015). 
Tethered honeybees formed longer-lasting memory associations with odour 
when provide with caffeine during training (Wright et al., 2013); caffeinated 
artificial flowers received more visits by bumblebees (Thomson et al., 2015). 
Thus, not only could caffeine enhance learning and memory of floral odours, 
but it could furthermore still have this effect when ingested by commercial 
pollinators in the nest, away from the target crop. It should be possible to 
enhance nest-based odour learning with caffeine, priming these pollinators 
with the scent of a crop’s flowers and resulting in commercial bumblebees or 
possibly honeybees having an initial stronger interest in visiting crop flowers 
than other flowers in the environment.
Indeed, this was demonstrated in Arnold et  al. (2021) in a laboratory 
experiment, in which bumblebees primed with a combination of synthetic 
strawberry crop floral odour, sugar solution and 0.1 mM caffeine proceeded 
to choose robotic flowers bearing that same odour more often, relative to 
distractor flowers with a different odour, than control bumblebees that had 
received uncaffeinated sugar solution alone, or the floral odour. While the 
effect was short-lived, this was to be expected in such a simplified setup where 
the targets were robotic, automatically refilling flowers, presented against 
an uncomplicated background, and both the strawberry floral scented and 
distractor targets provided an equal food reward in exchange for equal effort 
from the bees.
In a field situation, these types of commercial bumblebee boxes would 
be deployed in the crop, partway along polytunnels. A current challenge for 
growers of soft fruit and some salad products (e.g. tomatoes, bell peppers) in 
Europe is that commercial pollinators are insufficiently motivated to visit the 
crop; some bees will not forage at all, while other bees leave the tunnels and 
visit hedgerows, wildflowers and other non-crop plants around the site. As a 
result, on small farms, fewer pollination services are provided to the grower and 
wild and commercial bees compete for the same wild plant nectar and pollen 
resources, potentially impacting wild pollinators.
This may be less severe a problem in the United States, where field and 
farm sizes tend to be larger, and therefore bumblebees’ ability to leave the crop 
and visit alternative forage is limited. Caffeine technology has the potential to 
ameliorate some of these problems. It is likely that in such a field deployment, 
the short effect duration noted in the lab will be less pronounced because the 
field has a more complex environment, where the memory of odour may be 
more critical in locating rewarding flowers. Unlike in a laboratory, where the 60 Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions

target and distractor flowers are close, interspersed, easy to find and switch 
between and energetically require the same input to visit, the crop flowers in 
the field are closer to the nest and energetically less costly to visit, although 
they may be less rewarding depending on what other flowers are present in 
the broader vicinity.
A similar approach has been deployed in honeybees (Farina et al., 2020a; 
Marchi et al., 2021). This has the advantage of training many more workers to 
visit flowers and could be particularly valuable for this species that has such a 
large foraging range, and thus could choose to stray further from the crop. The 
disadvantage with honeybees is that if caffeine is applied to hives to enhance 
learning of crop floral odours, the honey in the hive could potentially become 
contaminated with caffeine and may be unsaleable, a consideration of special 
importance in regions where honey sales are a significant part of apiculturists’ 
income. This contrasts with monofloral honey from plants such as coffee and 
citrus, which contain naturally occurring caffeine.
3.3 Study 3: creation of odour lures
The concept of deploying odour lures to attract pollinators to a crop is one 
that must be considered carefully. Given the issues with spatial scales over 
which odour information is used, and the fact that the lure is a point source that 
cannot reflect the precise locations of the target flowers, there is a chance that 
it could result in pollinating insects visiting the lure more than the surrounding 
flowers.
The relevance of odour lures also depends on the foraging ranges of the 
insects. If odour lures draw insects away from other competing food sources 
(e.g. wildflowers) and on to the crop, their use only makes sense if non-crop 
foraging resources are present within the range of the targeted pollinating 
insect.
Lures and attractants that have been trialled broadly fall into two classes: 
those based on a pheromone relevant to the insect (e.g. a sex, foraging or queen 
pheromone), and those based on host plant odours. The main species that has 
been targeted is Apis mellifera, on pollinator-dependent fruit crops such as 
orchard fruit and melons. Examples of products and lures include Fruit-BoostTM
(based on the honeybee queen mandibular pheromone (Ellis and Delaplane, 
2009)) and Bee-Scent (based on Nasonov pheromone – a citral-geranial blend 
(Adams, 2014) – used by honeybee workers to communicate about foraging, 
alongside sugars). A few also use sugar mixtures (e.g. BeeLureTM), but spraying 
sugar on to crops risks proliferation of fungal antagonists in a similar that 
honeydew deposits left by sucking pests do, and sugar sprays can promote 
bees foraging from leaves rather than from the flowers themselves (Free, 1965).© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions 61
Where lures and attractants (e.g. Nasonov pheromone-based dispensers 
or Fruit-BoostTM) have been deployed over several trials in the late 1980s to the 
mid-1990s, there has often been no significant benefit to pollination (usually by 
honeybees, A. mellifera) and fruit set (Table 2). As such, this approach is seldom 
adopted in current agriculture and seems to yield unreliable benefits. Some 
more positive findings have come from Indian studies in Apis cerana and Apis 
dorsata, and stingless bees (Trigona spp.) have also been tested for responses 
(Patil et al., 2010).
More recently, numerous patents suggesting similar approaches (including 
with non-Apis bees) have been lodged (Guangde County Fotang Strawberry 
Planting Professional Cooperatives, 2015; Weifang Yourong Industry Co Ltd., 
2015a,b,c), reporting to improving pollination on crops such as raspberry. 
Some products also suggest providing the attractant to honeybees in the hive 
before deployment, using an odour-priming method similar to that previously 
discussed (Apicultural Institute of Jilin Province, 2011). These appear to 
be mostly based on honey-plant extract mixtures. While some of these new 
products may provide a reliable bee attractant with consistent benefits to the 
crop, results from previous research trials (Table 2) imply the performance 
of such products can be inconsistent. There are several potential reasons, in 
addition to the issues with spraying sugar solution indiscriminately on to plants, 
including:
• Bees’ formidable learning ability – if the odour itself does not reliably signal 
presence of a preferred food reward, bees will learn to stop responding 
to it.
• Concentration issues – volatiles can be interpreted differently at different 
concentrations so pheromones, may not induce behavioural responses at 
higher concentrations (close to the crop) or lower concentrations (edge of 
the field) compared to the ecologically relevant concentrations.
• Spatial distribution – encouraging foraging on the crop’s leaves, stems, 
etc. may not translate to visitation to the flowers.
However, there may be potential applications in more unusual pollinators that 
have not yet been exploited. Cacao suffers from low fruit set and visitation 
by a relatively small group of taxa that can effectively pollinate. The odour of 
the flowers is not strong, the insects most often do not disperse far, and the 
pollinating midges are often active early in the morning when the light levels 
around flowers may be low. Potentially, deploying odour lures on trees at the 
appropriate height may increase activity in the vicinity of flowers, or may result 
in the above-mentioned issues. While attempts have been made to synthesise 
the odour of cacao flowers (Arnold et al., 2019), the response of midges was 
unpromising; so creating an effective volatile blend would require more work.62 Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions

Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions 63
4 Summary
Pollination efficiency in crops needing pollen transfer via insect vectors 
requires first an understanding of the biochemical (olfactory) mechanisms of 
interactions between plant and pollinating organism. Unravelling all outcomes 
of interacting biotic/abiotic stresses on these mechanisms and translating this 
research to enable development of remedial biotechnologies (digital and 
gene-based) to alleviate pressure on pollination services is a crucial step to 
enable maintaining and supporting these valuable services for food production. 
Further, devising management options and harnessing nature-based solutions 
alongside the implementation of remedial biotechnologies will serve to ensure 
these important olfactory signalling mechanisms between pollinating taxa and 
crop plants are not compromised and food production levels are sufficiently 
and reliably maintained.
Improvements in the mechanistic understanding of a wider diversity of 
pollination contributors is needed. Visual and olfactory systems, and their 
relationship to flower-visiting activity, are well understood in some taxa (e.g. 
honeybee and bumblebee species) but not in others, so a broader mechanistic 
understanding would be valuable. In particular, the relative importance of 
different mechanisms in low-light conditions at night is not known and is likely 
to differ from mechanisms at play in diurnal pollination systems.
Importantly, all specialised olfactory detection and signalling mechanisms 
are liable to be directly or indirectly disrupted by anthropogenic environmental 
change (including air pollution, changes in soil chemistry, artificial light at 
night and climate change), with potential detrimental effects on pollination 
services, which have not been fully quantified. Increased understanding of 
the functioning of nocturnal pollination systems is critical for future efforts to 
conserve their ecological service.
5 Future trends
Future developments in the field of harnessing olfactory stimuli in crop 
pollination include methods of modifying the pollinators’ behaviour, including 
building on principles explained in the case studies presented earlier and 
employing precision techniques such as CRISPR to alter the crops themselves.
Future pollination attractants applied to the crop will need to overcome 
previously observed issues with point sources, pollinator learning and 
target misdirection; this will require precise regulation of concentration and 
understanding how that changes over space and time. To date, attractants 
focused on non-Apis bees have been rare, which may be a missed opportunity 
since honeybees are often not the optimal pollinator of many crops. However, 64 Olfaction in crop plant–pollinator interactions

new products are continually being developed and trialled and some more 
recent attractants have indeed focused on non-Apis bees.
Deployment of floral odours in contexts (primarily in the nest) where the 
aim is to prime or induce an odour bias, rather than attract directly, is a strategy 
showing considerable promise. This has now been demonstrated in principle 
in both honeybees (Marchi et al., 2021) and bumblebees (Arnold et al., 2021). 
So far primarily caffeine has been tested, but some work on honeybees has 
demonstrated a synergistic effect of caffeine and arginine on bee performance 
(Marchi et al., 2021), indicating that future olfactory-priming devices could 
incorporate this into the technology as well.
The limitations of floral attractants and priming devices will depend on 
context. In a completely open environment, the environmental factors discussed 
earlier (wind speed and weather affecting physiological state of crops) will 
be particularly important in influencing odour presence and dispersal. In 
a polytunnel, as used for many soft- and stone-fruits, odours are retained 
somewhat better but there are also adverse high temperatures influencing the 
pollinators. Conversely, in enclosed glasshouses, certain challenges such as the 
pollinators’ tendency to leave the crop and forage on surrounding vegetation 
become less significant so priming treatments are used more to increase 
motivation and activity on the crop.
Other technologies have the potential to grow in importance in future. Gene 
editing technologies offer great potential for future crop improvement, and 
this can extend to improving crop–insect olfactory interactions. The potential 
to restore functions of genes involved in VOC metabolism that may have been 
lost via selective breeding provides exciting opportunities to achieve better 
pollination activity and yield. While to date this has primarily been explored 
in ornamental crops (cut flowers) where floral fragrance is selected to please 
human consumers (Giovannini et al., 2021), the same principles could be 
applied to crop flowers to improve pollination.
6 Conclusion
Odour is one of a range of cue modalities that a plant can deploy in order 
to increase visitation and pollen transfer by floral visitors. However, the 
anthropogenic changes that have threatened populations of insect pollinators 
directly have wider implications as the very mechanisms by which crop plants 
and their pollinators communicate are vulnerable to disruption. Human activity 
has distorted pollinator–plant olfactory interactions, both by altering the plant’s 
odour production and the environment in which it operates. Understanding the 
nature of such disruptions is therefore important to develop effective mitigation 
strategies, and ultimately conserve olfactory-driven pollination services for © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

crop productivity. Solutions may lie in ‘precision pollination’, via behavioural 
manipulation of pollinators, or opportunities presented by biotechnology.
7 Where to look for further information
The biology of floral scent (Dudareva and Pichersky, 2006) provides a 
comprehensive description of the chemistry of flowers and their extraordinary 
diversity alongside, metabolic pathways for their biosynthesis and the 
genomics underpinning these biochemical processes. This book also provides 
a comprehensive description of the interactions floral chemicals drive especially 
with respect to pollinators. Insect olfaction (Hansson, 2010) deals with both 
olfaction as a model for a sensory system and the use of insect olfaction in 
mediating insect behaviour.
The 36th annual meeting of the International Society of Chemical Ecology 
(ISCE) (5–10 September 2021) provides a state of art snapshot of the science of 
floral volatiles and plant–pollinator interactions to give an indication of current 
key topics in this research area. The theme of the conference, ‘Chemical Ecology 
and Sustainable Development’, and abstracts were published online including 
two sessions on pollinator–flower interactions at all levels of ecological 
organisation in diverse taxa, and their evolutionary origins (https://isce2021
.carlamani.com/abstracts/Plant%20Pollinator%20Interactions%20combined
%20abstracts.pdf).
More information on the ecology of floral chemistry can be found in the
Journal of Chemical Ecology (https://www.springer.com/journal/10886) and

Chapter 3
The role of wind pollination in crop 
plants
Stephen Murphy, University of Waterloo, Canada
1 Introduction
Approximately 12% of flowering plants across the globe are wind pollinated 
(anemophilous) – with some species having both wind and animal pollinators 
(ambophilous) (Ackerman, 2000; Culley et al., 2002). Anemophily is important 
to about 60% of the world’s most important crop species – especially grasses 
(Poaceae) (Aizen et al., 2009; FAO, 2021). These include grasses, sedges, 
rushes, pecans, pistachios, hazelnuts, walnuts, coconut, mustards (e.g. 
canola), grapes, palms, coffee trees, and occasionally sunflowers and bamboo 
(see Cresswell et al., 2004; Ruiz-Sanchez et al., 2017; Saunders, 2018). 
Contemporary breeding programs have reduced the importance of open 
pollination in agricultural cultivars of some crops (e.g. wheat) (Zohary et al., 
2012).
2 Fundamental mechanisms of wind pollination
Wind pollination depends on three main factors: pollen production, release/
dispersal, and capture (Niklas, 1985; Ackerman and Kevan, 2005; Wilmer, 
2011; Timerman and Barrett, 2018). Floral and inflorescence architecture, 
together with factors such as plant height and movement (collector motion), 
are crucial to the efficiency of pollination and mating given the aerodynamics of 
wind pollination (Friedman and Harder, 2004; McCombe and Ackerman, 2018; 
Timerman and Barrett, 2021).

Wind pollination is facilitated by evaporation through the stomata in 
response to macro- and micro-meteorological conditions (Timerman and 
Barrett, 2018). Evaporation will cause anthers to dehisce and release pollen. 
While there are other mechanisms and other influences on anther dehiscence 
and pollen release, evaporation probably dominates because it reflects the 
macro-meteorological conditions better suited to pollen release (low relative 
humidity, high solar radiation, high temperatures, higher wind speeds, and 
turbulence).
3 Wind pollination and transgenic risks in grass crop 
species
Because grass crop species represent a large percentage of global food 
supplies, this section will focus on the mechanisms and transgenic risks.
3.1 Maize/corn
In the case of maize/corn (Zea mays), commercial production of seed corn relies 
on enforced cross pollination to produce single cross-hybrids (crossing two 
different inbred lines). This is done by artificially removing the male inflorescence 
(tassel) on the pollen recipient to ensure that two different genotypes cross 
to produce more vigorous hybrids with desired traits such as improved yield. 
Pollination in the field still depends on wind pollination because of the physical 
distance of the tassel at the tip of the maize plants versus the ears that are 
produced about halfway up the plant.
Research has focussed on understanding the mechanisms and timing of 
pollination to help farmers optimise success (Bechoux et al., 2000; Anderson 
et al., 2004). To increase proximate successful pollination between adjacent 
‘male’ and ‘female’ rows, cultivation practices can include deliberate planting 
patterns and manipulations of inflorescences. As an aside, if the goal is to 
harvest maize for silage/fodder, there is usually less focus on cultivation and 
enforced open pollination since the bulk of silage will come from the entire 
plant, not just the kernels.
The development of transgenic varieties of corn has renewed interest 
in processes of wind pollination, particularly the distances transgenic pollen 
might travel. This is because of the need to avoid the risk of ‘contaminating’ 
non-genetically modified corn with genetically modified pollen, given the 
concern of some consumers about consuming foods containing genetically 
modified ingredients, the risk to organic farmers of infringing certification 
rules for organic produce, and environmental risks such as the development 
of herbicide-resistant weeds due to pollination via pollen from transgenic 
herbicide-resistant corn varieties (Hernández-López, 2020).© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
The role of wind pollination in crop plants 75
These concerns have led to much work on detailed models of corn pollen 
emission, dispersal, and capture (e.g. Aylor et al., 2003; Bannert and Stamp, 
2007). While the rule of thumb that most corn pollen dispersal is leptokurtic 
and lands within 20 m or less seems to hold, the wealth of information on wind 
pollination has been immense. Studies like Klein et al (2003) have quantified, 
more precisely, how much and how far Zea pollen disperses. Comparisons 
of dispersal models like those of Klein et al. (2003) show that vegetation is – 
surprisingly – not a major barrier to pollen dispersal and the size, density, and 
aerodynamics of corn pollen mean that the probability functions of density 
and dispersal start becoming small even 5 m away, much smaller 20 m away, 
and smaller still after that. However, some studies have shown dispersal as 
far as 4 km, suggesting that recommended buffer zones of 20–30 m between 
transgenic and non-transgenic fields may not always be sufficient (Hofman 
et al., 2014). This suggests it is not possible to achieve zero risk unless one 
hermetically seals a field or has enormous guard rows.
The risk of weeds acquiring herbicide resistance from Zea may be lower 
because it has fewer wild weedy relatives – with the proviso that this risk cannot 
be ignored in its countries of origin. Its large (90 µm) pollen grain is less likely 
to be dispersed to any weedy relatives, and the weedy species that are in the 
margins near the end rows of corn often don’t flower concurrently. Further, their 
inflorescences and pistils will not allow corn pollen to alight, and the pollen 
usually will not germinate even if alight, and the species are not closely related 
so the chances of an intergeneric hybrid are very small.
3.2 Rice
It is not clear if rice (Oryza) presents a high risk for transgenic use because 
much of the pollination is more gravimetric - pollen falls from the male topmost 
flowers to the female ones below. The risk depends on how much lateral plant￾to-plant pollination there actually is. There are wild congenerics that can be 
considered weedy, increasing the risk of gene transfer that could create even 
more pernicious and invasive genotypes.
3.3 Wheat and other mainly self-pollinated grass crops
Triticum (wheat) may be less of a risk because it does not rely on outcrossing 
via wind pollination – the commercial varieties are mainly self-pollinated. 
However, there has been discussion of the advantages of new developing lines 
with open, receptive female flowers that can be cross-pollinated to produce a 
more genetically diverse wheat crop via wind pollination (Dixon et al., 2018). 
That may mean wind pollination may soon be a more important factor in 
wheat production, but it means more risk for transgenic contamination. This is 
probably the same for other mainly self-pollinating crops like barley and oats.76 The role of wind pollination in crop plants

3.4 Wind-pollinated hay/forage crops
Rather than focus on pollination or seed set, the trait targeted in breeding 
programs is usually producing palatable and nutritious leaves for livestock. 
Breeding focuses on reallocation of resources away from sexual reproduction, 
and this means allocation of resources away from flowers to improving leaves. 
There is a long history of plant breeding strategies and techniques, from the 
humbler origins of early cultivars of forage grasses to modern high-technology 
approaches (Barth, 2012).
Still, open wind pollination is an important consideration, and there is 
substantial use of crops like timothy (mainly Phleum pratense), fescues (Festuca), 
orchardgrasses (Dactylis), bromes (Bromus), Bermudagrass (Cynodon), 
bahiagrasses (Paspalum), blue/speargrasses (Poa), canarygrasses (Phalaris), 
redtops (Agrostis), sorghum (Sorghum), gamagrass (Tripsacum), millets/
panicgrasses (Brachiaria, Echinochloa, Urochloa, Panicum), and rye (Lolium).
While some species and cultivars are bred for self-pollination, many are 
open-pollinated, making for easier management from a mechanical and 
regulatory perspective since the ubiquity of pollen has meant little progress 
on transgenic applications in forage/hay grasses (Wang and Bremmer, 2012). 
Studies on pollination in forage grasses are sparse but, like many cash crops, 
there has been a focus on technologies from crossing inbred lines to transgenic 
approaches.
There are typical concerns about transgenic escapes. The main difference 
between forage grasses and a cash crop like maize is that most of the forage 
grasses have smaller pollen (20–40-μm diameter vs 90 μm). This means there 
is a greater risk (from the perspective of transgenes in pollen) of unwanted 
escapes and possible cross-fertilization if the donor and recipient are non￾sterile genotypes and not cleistogamous.
3.5 Wind-pollinated fruits and nuts
Studies on wind pollination in commercial production of fruits and nuts are 
found in the peer-reviewed literature (e.g. Polito et al., 2015), though there is an 
opportunity for a monograph on that subject. Chestnuts (Castanea), hazelnuts/
filberts (Corylus), pecans (Carya), walnuts (Juglans), pistachios (Pistacia), dates 
(Phoenix), olives (Olea), grapes (Vitis) are wholly or partially wind pollinated, and 
many nut trees (e.g. Macadamia) have anecdotal evidence of some importance 
of wind pollination. Much of the press around pollination and transgenics has 
focused on rescuing the chestnuts (e.g. Steiner et al., 2017) with the usual 
concerns over risk less prominent in this species because of its near-extirpation 
by blight. As transgenic research on chestnut proceeds apace, one can expect 
more interest in application to other wind-pollinated nut and fruit species, but © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
The role of wind pollination in crop plants 77
the transgenic debate will be more heated as most of those species are not 
imperilled.
3.6 Assessing overall transgenic risk in wind-pollinated crops
As Rong et al. (2012) noted in their study of risks of transgenic pollination and 
escape in rice (Oryza sativa), one of the challenges in experimental design and 
evaluation is trying to scale practical small-scale field scale studies up to the 
likely overall risk for crops planted over millions of hectares. If it is 1:1, then 
the smaller scale estimates are robust but, as Rong et al note, these can be off 
by a factor of 10 in those few studies that even scale up to 1–2 hectares. Rong 
et  al scaled to ~500 m2 and used a distance simulation model to show that 
there was low risk in their study on Oryza. This is consistent with the later study 
– that included size of pollen source – by Hu et al (2020).
Rong et al. (2012) note that one cannot assume a lower risk in outcrossing 
wind-pollinated crops like Z. mays or for Secale cereale (Rye) – which is both a 
crop and a weed (in Triticum). Zea is less likely to be vulnerable to transgenic 
escapes but S. cereale is a strongly outcrossing, wind-pollinated grass that has 
been transgenically modified, so the risk is likely greater with what smaller (40–
50 µm) and lighter pollen, though Kutlu (1982) noted that about 97% of the 
pollen is dispersed less than 20 m. The same issues arise with many other crop 
species (e.g. Hordeum) with the same general patterns of relatively low risk.
3.7 Assessing overall transgenic risk with wind-pollinated 
agricultural weed species
Wind-pollinated weed species include Ambrosia, Bromus, Setaria, Elymus, 
Amaranthus, Festuca, and Chenopodium. These genera represent many of 
the problematic cash crop weeds in North America. Studies like Friedman and 
Harder (2004) demonstrate that the evolutionary history of weed inflorescence 
architecture means they are prolific at emitting and capturing conspecific 
pollen, despite expected stochasticity. While dispersal can be affected by the 
weedy individual’s phenology relative to the growth of crops or other weeds 
and their height in taking advantage of wind, the wind-pollinated weeds seem 
to face few challenges in successfully setting seed in competition with crops. 
Since they do not depend much or at all on pollinators (though some may be 
ambophilous), even catastrophic acute or chronic losses of animal habitat and 
pollinators will not diminish their persistence.
If heterospecific pollen transfer occurs and the hybrids are formed 
between crops and weeds of different species or genera, the risk of transgenic 
escape and conference of pesticide resistance would be problematic. The null 
hypothesis is that this is less likely given barriers to forming intergeneric hybrids. 78 The role of wind pollination in crop plants

There is a higher risk that overuse of pesticides in resistant crops selects for 
pesticide-resistant weeds rather than a direct transfer of the genetic resistance 
from crop to seed. Since it does not appear that planting patterns of crops 
might sufficiently reduce pollen transfer between conspecific weeds and some 
of those weeds are clonal, wind pollination presents an intractable challenge in 
that it is not likely that farmers can thwart weed reproduction except by more 
interventionist management.
4 Promoting wind pollination in open-pollinated crop 
species
There are still many farms where open pollination to produce seeds for locally 
adapted genotypes is important. Traditional agriculture in Meso-America 
relies heavily on local land races of the three sisters – maize (anemophilous), 
beans (entomophilous), and squash (entomophilous) – grown in the milpa 
system. As an example, 30% of the farms in the author’s region of southwestern 
Ontario in Canada still have open-pollinated forage fields, partly due to a 
higher proportion of farms owned by the Mennonite religious community that 
deliberately eschews modern in favour of traditional farming techniques.
One way to maximize open-pollinated seed set in forage grass fields is to 
maintain (or restore) forest tracts/corridors or tall meadow tracts/field margins 
around each field. These areas (which are often unproductive and unprofitable 
for crop production) can then harbour a diverse ecosystem, helping to meet 
conservation goals and deliver ecosystem services other than pollination such 
as promoting natural enemies of crop pests, acting as a windbreak to protect 
crops and preventing erosion, etc. A particular benefit is the conservation 
of wind-pollinated native species. Research, for example, by the author and 
colleagues covering multiple kilometres of margins of farm fields in southern 
Ontario in Canada found substantive (>500 ramets) populations of over 150 
species of wind-pollinated grasses, sedges, and rushes, many of which were 
thought to have been locally extinct.
Marginal areas can provide a rich wind-pollination environment for native 
forbs and a reservoir of rare species (NSERC-CANPOLIN, 2015). From the 
pollination perspective, there is some risk of heterospecific pollen transfer 
potentially interfering with the forage crop, depending on whether the diurnal 
and seasonal phenologies of the forage crop overlap with other grasses. There 
is also a need to manage field margins so that they do not become a refuge for 
pest species – from crop pests like rusts that may have their alternative hosts on 
native plants (e.g. Thalictrum) to deer and crop-eating birds to weeds that may 
thrive in margins and then disperse into crop fields, especially no-till fields that 
resemble the environment of field margins.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
The role of wind pollination in crop plants 79
The big ‘win’ is the ability of tracts – especially forest tracts – to act effectively 
as an aerodynamic bell jar, sealing in the pollen so it increases the chances of 
successful pollen transfer within a defined area rather than becoming lost to 
the atmosphere or adjoining fields. This is more effective for night-pollinating 
species with a number of forage grass species that pollinate mainly at night 
such as the forage grass P. pratense (Murphy, 2000).
In fields enclosed by forest tracts, there usually exists a surface-based 
radiation inversion at night, which is caused by convection-mediated high 
temperatures in the field during the day (Murphy, 2000). Essentially, this 
prevents material, such as pollen, from leaving or entering a field until the 
inversion burns off after sunrise. Because most individuals of forage grasses 
like P. pratense flower before sunrise, most of the pollen would be deposited 
within the field in which it was originally dispersed prior to the burn-off.
Pollen is generally dispersed in a leptokurtic manner: most of the pollen 
is dispersed within 100 m of the parent plant. Should any pollen enter the 
atmosphere before the inversion has stabilised or any pollen enter after it burns 
off, it is most likely to be carried long distances (> 20 km) as the atmosphere 
above the fields tends to lift particles upwards at these times. Although there 
is some dispute over some aspects of theories on atmospheric stability and 
transport of pollen, other sources support these interpretations (Ogden et al., 
1969; Okubo and Levin, 1989; Di-Giovanni and Kevan, 1991; Giostra et al., 
1991; Jacobs and van Boxel, 1991; Tiriabassi et al., 1991).
5 Conclusion and future trends
The general milieu of pollination and specific mechanisms of wind pollination 
cannot be isolated from the larger forces that affect them and they, in turn, 
affect. The above ‘good news’ vignette on wind-pollinated native species in 
field margins is an exemplar of that embedded and recursive relationship. 
Symbolically, it should remind us that while humans have bred crops and made 
many grass-based crops less reliant on unmanaged open wind pollination, 
humans owe our existence in part to wind pollination. Wind pollination is one 
thread in the development of human civilisation.
The biggest threat to farming – wind-pollination issues included - is 
anthropogenic climate change (e.g. Kjøhl et al., 2011). Given the relative dearth 
of papers focused on wind pollination in crops, it is not surprising that there 
is even less on impacts of climate change. Research has focused on climate 
change impacts on wind-pollination species in vulnerable e.g. alpine habitats 
(Hoiss et al., 2013) or on broader topics, like impacts on forests and/or wind 
dispersal of seeds rather than pollen (e.g. King and Ackerly, 2021).
The response of wind-pollinated crops will be as varied as the pace 
and intensity of climate change impact on local habitats and on the factors 80 The role of wind pollination in crop plants

affecting pollination (e.g. humidity and wind). An increase in the frequency 
and persistence of higher local temperatures might facilitate wind pollination. 
However, that could be offset by increased precipitation that would wash the 
pollen away or if the relative humidity also increased drought or even simple 
rises in mean temperatures also can cause re-allocations or net decreases in 
biomass, hence less ability to produce even the smaller and less ‘expensive’ 
inflorescences and flowers in wind-pollinated species. It is possible that 
climate change might have a more immediate impact on animal pollination, 
potentially favouring wind-pollinated crops, but that is in the context of the 
overwhelmingly negative impacts if climate change continues on its present 
trajectory.

Chapter 4
Assessing climate change impacts on 
pollinators
Kit Prendergast, Curtin University, Australia
1 Introduction
Flower visiting insects are major components in ecosystems, including 
agricultural ecosystems, where their foraging on angiosperms results in 
pollination services. In most systems, the main pollinators are bees (James 
et al., 2008; Batra, 1995), with much research revealing a diversity of flower￾visiting taxa enhances pollination services (Dainese et al., 2019; Garibaldi et al., 
2013, 2016; Pérez-Méndez et al., 2020, Potts et al., 2016). As such, preserving 
this component of biodiversity, and its ecosystem services, is fundamental for 
sustainable agriculture and meeting nutritional demands of a growing human 
population (Kevan et al., 1990). Whilst pollinators face numerous threats in 
the Anthropocene, one of the major threats they face, which is a threat shared 
with biodiversity and human livelihoods (Reid and Huq, 2005; Battarbee et al., 
2008), is that of anthropogenic climate change. We can predict that climate 
change impacts will be particularly acute on pollinators, with multiple impacts 
of climate change impinging upon their survival. The challenges that climate 
change may pose to pollinators will be covered in the next section, along with 
what evidence is available to date to support or question these theoretical 
predictions on the impacts of climate change on pollinators. I will then highlight 
the gaps in research to date and recommend future research directions. Finally, 
I will cover some measures that may be adopted to enable pollinators to face 
ongoing climate change challenges.

2 Challenges anthropogenic climate change poses to 
pollinators
Flower-visiting insects may be particularly susceptible to climate change due 
to their small body size which limits migration, their reliance on flowers for 
nutrition, and how they face many other threats such as loss of wildflowers, 
pesticides and fragmentation.
2.1 The impact of rising temperatures on pollinators
In most regions of the planet, climate change, by enhancing the greenhouse 
effect, is resulting in global warming (National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, 2020). The rate of warming is unprecedented, and already as 
of 2020, combined land and ocean temperature have increased at an average 
rate of 0.08°C per decade since 1880, with average rates of increase since 1981 
(0.18°C) being more than twice that rate (National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, 2020). Pollinators are known to strongly structure communities 
(e.g. Mayr et al., 2020), and thus they are sensitive to increasing temperatures 
under climate change. It can be expected that increased temperatures caused 
by climate change will have numerous impacts on pollinators, and plant–
pollinator assemblages (Fig. 1).
Not all regions however experience equal degrees of warming, and 
within a given region, different microclimates will occur due to differences 
in tree cover, land-surface cover and topography (Lenoir et al., 2017). At a 
direct level, because many pollinators are invertebrates, they are ectotherms, 
and their activity levels are influenced by the temperature of their ambient 
environment. This relationship is also influenced by body size, shape, colour 
and insulation (Fig. 1), whereby larger, rounder-bodied, darker-coloured, ‘hairy’ 
animals absorb and retain heat to a greater extent than smaller, slender, light￾coloured, hairless animals. Consequently, big, dark-coloured, fuzzy bees like 
many Bombus would be more sensitive to hotter temperatures than tiny, light￾coloured, hairless Brachyhesma (Fig. 1).
Research on 24 Meliponini species revealed the importance of body size, 
colour and behaviour of bee thermal characteristics (Pereboom and Biesmeijer, 
2003). In accordance with biophysical principles, where diffusion, including of 
heat, occurs more rapidly for smaller objects with a higher surface area relative 
to volume, small bees reached lower temperature excesses and warmed up 
as well as lost heat more rapidly than larger bees. Both between species, and 
within species with colour morphs, bees that were darker (more black/brown) 
experienced a 28% higher temperature excess and has a 26% greater cooling 
constant, K, than similar-sized light-coloured (more yellow) species (Pereboom 
and Biesmeijer, 2003).© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

However, these experiments were on dead bees – when looking at 
foraging bees, differences between colour morphs were minimal (Pereboom 
and Biesmeijer, 2003). This is because live bees can alter their behaviour 
adaptively whilst foraging e.g. forage in cooler/warmer microenvironments. 
Differences in convective or evaporative heat loss, or production of metabolic 
heat during flight, can also override the influence of body colour on heat gain/
loss (Heinrich, 2013).
Behavioural adaptations also come into play and may represent a way for 
species to adapt to warmer temperatures: for example, large-bodied bees 
are known to commence foraging earlier, before the day heats up (Biesmeijer, 
1997). However, there may also be risks here such as being limited by low light 
(Theobald et al., 2007, Dorey et al., 2020). Dark-coloured bees may also avoid 
overheating by foraging in shady patches; however, if smaller bees also need 
to forage in shadier locations, competition may occur, and shadier patches also 
contain flowers with less concentrated nectar (Biesmeijer, 1997, Biesmeijer 
et al., 1999).
The current distribution of Meliponini in Central America suggests that 
body size and colour explain biogeographic distribution patterns through 
the bees’ thermal properties (Pereboom and Biesmeijer, 2003). Under climate 
change we may see shifts in the biogeography of species, and/or evolution 
towards lighter, smaller body sizes if standing genetic variation exists.
Experimental studies have demonstrated the negative impacts of warmer 
temperatures on bee fitness directly. Using eight rearing treatments, the effect 
of climate change on eight cavity-nesting solitary bees was investigated by 
manipulating fall and spring temperature, fall duration and timing of spring 
onset (Slominski and Burkle, 2019). Responses differed according to the 
diapausing strategy of the bees, with Osmia, which overwinter as adults, 
being more vulnerable than Megachile, which overwinter a pre-pupae. 
Osmia responded primarily to spring onset, with earlier spring onset causing 
increased pre-emergence mortality and weight-loss, reduced post-emergence 
lifespan and also caused unequal shifts in emergence timing for males vs. 
females. Megachile responded primarily to warmer spring temperatures, 
which results in decreased weight loss and increased lifespan. Variable 
responses to increased temperatures according to over-wintering strategy 
appear to be common. For example, storing cocoons of nine species of 
solitary, cavity-nesting bees (Osmia bicornis, O. cornuta, Megachile ligniseca,
M. versicolor, M. centuncularis, Chelostoma florisomne, Heriades truncorum, 
and the cleptoparasitic Coelioxys mandibularis (Megachilidae) and Hylaeus 
communis (Colletidae)) at different overwintering temperatures (1.5–9.5°C), 
resulted in significant differences between species in weight loss, weight at 
emergence, and emergence date (Fründ et al., 2013). Those overwintering 
as adults generally exhibited decreased weight and earlier emergence © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators 89
with increasing temperature due to increased energy expenditure, whilst 
species overwintering as pre-imaginal stages exhibited weaker, or opposite 
responses.
These differential responses indicate that some species are particularly 
vulnerable to the thermal effects of climate change, whilst others may 
even benefit, leading to shifts in the taxonomic composition of pollinator 
communities.
In addition to lab-based experimental manipulations, negative fitness 
impacts of increased temperatures have also been demonstrated through 
in situ field experiments. By altering the thermal properties of nesting boxes 
by painting them different colours to simulate cooler temperatures (painted 
white, approx. 1950 temperatures), control, and future warmer temperatures 
(painted black, approx. 2040–2099 temperatures), it was found that the solitary 
bee Osmia ribifloris exhibited delayed emergence phenology, and increased 
phenological variance in the warming treatment, as well as reductions in body 
mass and fat content (Caradonna et al., 2018). In addition, mortality drastically 
increased: bees in the warming treatment suffered 30–75% mortality, whereas 
those in the control and cooler treatment had negligible mortality. Taken 
together, these direct mortality costs, as well as indirect fitness costs through 
reduced body condition, and phenological asynchrony, means this species 
may risk extinction in warmer parts of its range under climate change.
Global warming has already had major detrimental impacts on wild bees. 
Using a long-term database of ~550000 georeferenced occurrence records of 
66 Bombus species across North America and Europe, increasing frequency 
of hotter temperatures predicted species local extinction risk, chances of 
colonizing a new area, and changing species richness (Soroye et al., 2020). 
The impact on population extinction-colonisation dynamics of increasing 
frequencies of temperatures that exceed historically observed tolerances 
was independent of land-use change. This demonstrates that climate change 
represents a major driver of Bombus declines.
2.1.1 The impact of changing rainfall patterns
Increasing temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns are also causing 
increased water stress and limitations for flowers, with flow-on effects on 
pollinators. The impact of climate change causing reduced rainfall has been 
extremely evident in Australia, where there has been an increasing frequency 
and intensity of drought which has caused dieback of key honey sources 
and reduced nectar flows (Hoffmann et al., 2019), leading to yield losses for 
beekeepers (Somerville, 2020). Drought impacts on Australian native bees 
have not been published to date.90 Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators

2.2 Loss of ground and moving around
Global climate change is predicted to affect habitat suitability and geographic 
distribution of pollinators. Under warmer temperatures, organisms can keep 
track of their current thermal niche by migrating to cooler regions so that they 
stay within their climatic envelope. This may mean shifting their distribution 
pole-wards, or upwards to higher altitudes. However, some species will 
be unable to respond adaptively, and instead climate change will lead to 
reductions in their fundamental niche, resulting in range reductions. A number 
of studies have modelled how climate change scenarios will alter the ranges of 
pollinator species. For example, ecological niche modelling (ENM) was used 
to estimate distribution changes in 18 Mesoamerican Bombus species using 
current and future climate emissions scenarios (representative concentration 
pathway 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) and models (CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, and MIROC￾ESM-CHEM) (Martínez-López et al., 2021). The sobering result was that all 
species were predicted to undergo a reduction in their potential distribution 
and habitat suitability due to projected climate change; even under a low 
emissions scenario, distribution losses of 7–76% were predicted by 2050. 
Species are also predicted to shift their distributions by a 100–500 m upslope 
in altitude and 1–581 km away from a species’ current geographic centroid of 
their distribution.
There are, however, not only ‘losers’ but also ‘winners’ under climate change. 
For example, some species are expanding their geographic distribution. 
Modelling has revealed that an already widespread, arid-adapted Australian 
bee Ceratina australensis (Apidae: Xylocopinae) under Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change conditions predicted for 2070 
will have an increased area of suitable habitat, including an increased range 
within protected areas (Dew et al., 2019).
2.3 Wrong place, wrong time? Temporal and spatial mismatches 
between plants and pollinators
2.3.1 Mismatches in phenology
Whilst species in tropical regions, and many eusocial bees, are perennially 
active, the majority of bee species have a limited flight season spanning only 
a few months (Prendergast, 2018). Similarly, most plants do not flower year￾round and have a short blooming period. For specialist bees especially, if they 
emerge before or after their host plant blooms, they may suffer from insufficient 
resources. The cues that mediate the onset of blooming, and emergence of bees, 
may also be different for the two partners. If there are phenological mismatches, 
bees can be expected to suffer fitness losses, and whilst natural selection would © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators 91
select for adaptations to increase synchronisation, climate change may outpace 
the rates of adaptation, causing decoupling and eventually extinction.
On the other side of the pollination equation, if a plant loses its host 
species due to mismatches in phenology, it will suffer pollination limitation, 
leading to loss in yields for crops species and potential local extinction for wild 
plant species (Fig. 1). For plants, the situation is likely less dire than for bees, for 
whilst there are numerous oligolectic bee species, there are few plants visited 
by a single pollinator (Jordano et al., 2006). However, in a given location, a plant 
species may indeed depend upon one or few species for pollination, which 
may occur for crop or horticultural species grown outside of their native range, 
or when the plant exists in a habitat that only supports one or a few pollinators. 
There are also examples of specialised bee–flower interactions exist (e.g. Cane, 
2018; Macior, 1968; Houston et al., 1993; Pauw, 2006), and pollination service 
declines associated with pollinators assemblage declines (Burkle et al., 2013). 
Modelling has revealed that under climate change, plant extinctions are likely 
to cause cascading extinctions throughout ecological networks (Schleuning 
et al., 2016).
The cues for plant flowering are better well known than cues for emergence 
for most bee species. A recent study into the phenology of bees over time 
using records of bee activity for 67 species collected over 9 years in the Rocky 
Mountains found that the main driver for phenology of bees was climate, with 
emergence advancing with earlier snowmelt timing, whilst later phenophases 
were best explained by functional traits, in particular overwintering stage and 
nest location (Stemkovski et al., 2020). Concerningly, looking at flower bloom 
phenology over the same period found that bee phenology was less sensitive 
to climate variation than flower phenology, pointing to the potential for reduced 
synchrony.
A number of studies have reported phenological mismatches between 
plants and their pollinators under climate change. A natural experimental study 
on two Osmia species (O. cornuta and O. bicornis) – a genus that is known 
to be an effective pollinator of stone fruits and apples – found that warming 
temperatures advanced flowering more strongly than bee emergences, and 
bee emergences were advanced in males, but not females (Kehrberger and 
Holzschuh, 2019). Moreover, this phenological mismatch was posited to lead 
to pollination limitations under climate change for the red-listed plant Pulsatilla 
vulgaris.
Another study has revealed that phenological mismatches due to climate 
change will impair fitness of both an important crop, Cucurbita pepo, and its 
main pollinator, the oligolectic Eucera pruinosa, with impacts already apparent 
at a northern part of the bee’s range (Willis Chan and Raine, 2021). Less than 
half of the bee population emerged by the time the crop flowering window 92 Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators

ended, and only 31.4% of the flowering period supported the period when 
both male and female bees were present to reproduce.
A large 4-year study of 132 plant species and 665 pollinating insect species 
in a Mediterranean plant–pollinator community also found that years of earlier 
flower bloom onset were associated with lower species richness, portending 
to losses in pollinators and pollination services under ongoing climate change 
causing phenological mismatches (Petanidou et al., 2014).
Experimental studies have found even short temporal mismatches 
can have severe fitness consequences. Using flight cages, mismatches in 
phenology in terms of earlier emergence of 3 solitary species of bees than 
flowers were simulated, in terms of (i) a mismatch of 3 days and (ii) a mismatch 
of 6 days and (iii) control: bees and flowers occur simultaneously (Schenk et al., 
2018). All species suffered major fitness losses under the 6-day mismatch, with 
females showing strongly reduced activity and reproductive output. Under the 
3-day mismatch, the late-spring specialist Osmia brevicornis produced fewer 
brood cells, and  although both the early-spring species  O. cornuta  and the 
mid-spring species  O. bicornis  produced the same number of brood cells, 
O. cornuta decreased the number of female offspring, and O. bicornis spread 
the brood cells over fewer nests, which may increase offspring mortality due to 
parasitoids.
One of the largest scale studies to model impacts on climate-change￾induced mismatches between plant and pollinator phenology revealed 
that up to half of pollinator species could suffer from resource shortages 
(Memmott et al., 2007). The study, using a highly resolved empirical network of 
interactions between 1420 pollinator species and 429 plant species, simulated 
how a doubling of atmospheric CO2 could be expected to cause phenological 
shifts between plants and pollinators. Depending on model assumptions, 
mismatches between activity periods led to 17–50% of pollinators having 
reduced floral resources, with up to half of the activity periods of flower visitors 
falling completely outside the time of their floral host blooms, as well as causing 
decreased diet breadth of pollinators. There has, however, also been research 
reporting no mismatch between bees and flowering plants. Long-term datasets 
have found that it appears that plants and bees are undergoing almost parallel 
shifts in phenology (Bartomeus et al., 2011).
2.3.2 Mismatches in distribution
As noted earlier, species may experience shifts in their current distribution 
under climate change. Of course, for pollinators, they must rely on their host 
plant(s) shifting to a similar extent. When it comes to agriculture, current 
locations where a crop is grown may no longer support the populations of 
its pollinator, or, conversely, if growers need to grow their crops elsewhere © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators 93
because the climate no longer supports the effective growth of that crop, its 
pollinators may not migrate to that new location.
Whilst range contractions under climate change are predicted, there have 
also been studies that suggest plants and pollinators will not experience spatial 
mismatches. For example, using species distribution modelling for 11 cactus 
species from the southern Central Andes and their spatial (mis)match with their 
pollinators (18 species and 11 genera of animals, including bees, birds, wasps 
and moths) under 2 future scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for the years 2050 
and 2070, an increase in the spatial match with their mutualists under future 
scenarios was actually predicted (Gorostiague et al., 2018).
Spatial mismatches are also predicted for plant species that provide human 
nutrition. Tomatoes are nutritious fruits high in lycopene, vitamin C and other 
nutrients (Canene-Adams et al., 2005). As a species that requires sonication 
(buzz pollination), the current main managed pollinator Apis mellifera cannot 
pollinate tomatoes, and thus this crop, as well as other plants with poricidal 
anthers, are entirely reliant on other alternative pollinators, and consequently 
are at risk of pollination deficits due to pollinator mismatches. Using baseline 
(1961–90) climate and future (2050s and 2080s) climatic projections in 
ecological niche models fitted with occurrences of 15 species of wild bees 
documented in the literature as pollinators of tomatoes, baseline and future 
potential distribution of suitable climatic conditions of targeted species were 
used to create maps of richness change across North America and how this 
corresponded with tomato growing regions (Carrasco et al., 2021). Not only 
did some species exhibit declines, but up to 11 of these species were projected 
to decline in the Eastern USA. Furthermore, this is anticipated to have impact 
on tomato pollination, as overlapping maps of species richness change with 
tomato crop regions, richness declines corresponded with areas with a high 
concentration of tomato crops.
2.4 Extreme events
Climate change is predicted to not only increase mean temperatures but also 
increase the frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as heat waves, 
droughts, floods, cyclones and fires (Banholzer et al., 2014). Compared with the 
more chronic aspects of climate change, these acute aspects which represent 
‘SHOCKs’ (events that are a Sudden, High-magnitude Opportunity for a 
Catastrophic ‘Kick’) are less well-studied, and, by their nature, are more difficult 
to study being erratic and unpredictable (Erenler et al., 2020; Van De Pol et al., 
2017). Bees appear to be particularly vulnerable to increased frequency of 
hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons; prolonged or extreme drought or floods; 
increased frequency or severity of wildfires, and temperature extremes (Klein 
et al., 2017). A meta-analysis involving 117 studies (74% being mensurative) 94 Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
on natural hazards  to pollinators and pollination in natural and cultivated 
systems found evidence of community and population-level impacts to plants 
and pollinators from climatological (extreme heat, fire, drought), hydrological 
(flooding), meteorological (hurricanes) and geophysical (including tsunamis) 
extreme events (Nicholson and Egan, 2020). Whilst the majority of cases did 
report negative impacts, 19% found no significant effect (Nicholson and Egan, 
2020).
The effect of heat waves has been experimentally studied on a number 
of Bombus species, and has revealed that responses are species-specific, 
with widespread species being relatively tolerant, whereas declining species 
are sensitive to hyperthermic stress (Zambra et al., 2020). Similar results 
of differential sensitivity of widespread, relatively ‘warm-adapted’ Bombus
and declining, cold-adapted Bombus have been reported in terms of how 
simulated heat waves impact fertility and attractiveness of Bombus males. 
Here, heat shock (40°C) had minimal impacts on the warm-adapted Bombus 
terrestris, but negatively impacted sperm viability and DNA integrity, as well 
as the structure of cephalic labial glands and the production of pheromones, 
potentially making males less ‘sexy’ for cold-adapted declining B. magnus and
B. jonellus (Martinet et al., 2021).
Whilst the impact of flooding on native bees has not been explicitly studied 
in a climate change context, extreme flooding has been found to devastate 
populations of the ground-nesting bee Andrena vaga (Fellendorf et al., 2004).
Even if studying impacts of these extreme ‘unreplicable’ events will fail to 
meet ‘gold standards’ of well-designed, well-replicated studies with controls, 
doing so nevertheless is highly valuable to better understand how populations 
may respond to extreme events, especially when they punctuate a long-term 
study, underscoring the need for ongoing, long-term monitoring of pollinator 
populations (Erenler et al., 2020).
2.4.1 Going up in flames
Fire is a natural part of many (but not all) landscapes; however, climate change 
is predicted to increase the severity, intensity and frequency of large, hot fires 
(Barbero et al., 2015, Aponte et al., 2016). Already, much of Australia and 
California (USA) have experienced widespread, catastrophic fires linked with 
climate change (Abram et al., 2021, Boer et al., 2020). The impact of fires on 
bees has been relatively understudied, especially in regions like Australia 
(Prendergast, in prep). Impacts are likely to range widely depending on the 
extent of the fire, the season, previous fire history, fire frequency and the 
dominant type of vegetation (Prendergast, in prep). In some regions, fire can 
benefit bees (Simanonok and Burkle, 2019), whereas in other contexts it can 
be a detriment to bees (Frankie et al., 1997). A very clear example of severe © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators 95
negative impacts of climate change-induced fires on a native bee species can be 
seen in the population of Xylocopa (Lestis) aerata on Kangaroo Island, off South 
Australia (Glatz et al., 2015). This species is strongly associated with Banksia
trees as a nesting substrate and if fires are too frequent, there is no renewal 
of this re-seeding species, which moreover takes decades to reach a maturity 
stage suitable for the bees to nest in. Whilst they also nest in Xanthorrhoea
stalks, these are only suitable 2–5 years after fire (Glatz et al., 2015). Large￾scale bushfires in 2007 resulted in the population dwindling (Glatz et al., 2015). 
Whilst installation of artificial nesting substrates aided in population recovery, 
breeding success declined after the first year of installation due to climate 
change: the next couple of years were characterised by low spring and summer 
rain, such that although artificial nesting habitat was now available, the food 
that the bees needed for survival and reproducing the next generation was 
not (Hogendoorn et al., 2021). X. aerata then suffered further losses as extreme 
large-scale bushfires again decimated its habitat in 2019–20 (Hogendoorn et al., 
2021). With climate change causing drier conditions, impacting flowering and 
leading to increased frequency and severity of extreme wildfire events, there 
is a real fear the Kangaroo Island population of X. aerata will become extinct 
(Hogendoorn et al., 2021). Nevertheless, in the absence of extreme fire events, 
using MaxEnt algorithms to model both the current distribution and effect of 
warming scenarios on the distribution of both X. aerata and its main host plants, 
suitable areas, whilst contracting towards the southeast, are not predicted to 
cause extinction (Santos et al., 2020). Although most other species of Australian 
bees have not been monitored to track how their populations respond to fires, 
using publicly available collection and GIS datasets, combined with life-history 
data, modelling extinction risk for 553 Australian native bee species from the 
2019–20 catastrophic Australian wildfires revealed marked impacts (Dorey 
et al., 2021). Based on fire overlap, intensity, frequency and life-history traits, 
two species are now eligible for listing as Endangered and nine as Vulnerable 
under IUCN criteria (Dorey et al., 2021).
2.5 Climate change altering pollinator cues
2.5.1 Not so attractive
Climate change may indirectly alter plant–pollinator relationships by causing 
changes in plant morphology or signals that pollinators use as cues to forage. 
This has seldom been studied explicitly in a climate change context; however, 
we can predict that climate change, through water stress, can induce decreases 
in plant height, flower number, size, bloom duration and colour, and alter 
olfactory signals may cause disruptive impacts (Descamps et al., 2021b). 96 Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators

However, CO2 enrichment may have beneficial impacts on bees by increasing 
investment in flower abundance (Jablonski et al., 2002).
2.5.2 Not so rewarding?
Climate-change-induced water stress and drought are known to impact flower 
blooming, leading to flower abortion. It can also further reduce food rewards 
offered by flowers by reducing nectar volume, concentration or composition 
(Descamps et al., 2021b). However not all plants respond uniformly, and nectar 
production or sugar amount or concentration may even increase under drought 
(Descamps et al., 2021b). Under elevated temperatures plants including crop 
species such as soybeans have been found to decrease pollen production 
(Scaven and Rafferty, 2013). Pollen viability has also been shown to decrease 
under drought conditions (Descamps et al., 2021b). Experimental research 
on a bee-pollinated plant, Impatiens glandulifera, revealed that both heat 
and water stress reduced flowering resources, pointing to potential negative 
impacts on bees: the number of flowers was reduced by 40–90% in response 
to drought, heat stress reduced flower longevity, and higher temperatures led 
to reductions in nectar volume and protein content (Descamps et al., 2021a).
2.6 Synergisms
Climate change and its multiple components (warming, extreme events, altered 
rainfall patterns, increased CO2) do not occur in isolation of other environmental 
(biotic and abiotic) and anthropogenic variables, which can act synergistically 
to amplify or counteract the impacts of one variable of climate change acting 
in isolation.
2.6.1 Warming, CO2 enrichment and nitrogen deposition
Climate change is associated with both global warming as well as high CO2
concentrations. In addition, many parts of the globe are experiencing increased 
nitrogen deposition. The combined impacts of climate warming, CO2 enrichment 
and N-deposition can alter plant chemistry, altering floral attractiveness and/
or nutritional rewards for pollinators. The interacting effects of these global 
environmental drivers were studied in a model system using pumpkins and 
their Bombus pollinators (Hoover et al., 2012). It was revealed that they non￾additively affect flower morphology, phenology, flower sex ratios and nectar 
chemistry (sugar and amino acids), which in turn altered the attractiveness 
of nectar to Bombus pollinators. This had fitness impacts, reducing Bombus
worker longevity. Surprisingly, Bombus responded maladaptively, being more © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators 97
attracted to and consuming greater amounts of nectar that reduced their 
survival by 22%.
2.6.2 Climate change and land-use change
Land cover is also predicted to shift under climate change. As a result, species 
may not only experience shifts in distribution but also may be constrained 
by the availability and distribution of suitable habitat. A study simulating 
future land-cover changes and temperature changes on the distribution of 
bumblebee species endemic to East Asia revealed stark and sobering results, 
with 17–27 (59–93 %) of the species exhibiting range contractions, leading to 
losses of species richness in areas, and warranting the status of species to be 
upgraded according to IUCN threatened species criteria (Naeem et al., 2019). 
Considering both climate and land-use change together is far more realistic, 
and has been shown to greatly alter predictions to species’ distributions 
compared with climate-only and static land-use models (Marshall et al., 2018). 
Modelling the combined impacts of dynamic land use and land-cover change 
along with climate change on distribution patterns of 48 species of European 
Bombus revealed that whilst there was considerable variation among species 
in their responses, the majority of species were predicted to lose considerable 
range, particularly under the extreme growth scenario (i.e. ‘Growth Applied 
Strategy’(GRAS) – IPCC A1FI; mean projected temperature rise in Europe at 
2100 is 5.6°C; a maximum change scenario driven by policies of deregulation 
and economic growth), with a number of local extinctions (Marshall et al., 2018).
2.6.3 Drought and competition
Loss in flowering resources due to drought means resources will become 
limiting, setting the stage for resource competition, resulting in fitness losses 
to the inferior competitor if two or more species share overlapping foraging 
niches. There is strong evidence that drought exacerbates competitive effect of 
introduced honeybees on wild bees. Ten years of data revealed that increased 
A. mellifera abundance corresponded with decreased Bombus use of the most 
abundant forage plant, reduced diet overlap and reduced Bombus abundances 
in the following year, with decreases in floral abundance from drought and 
reduced spring rainfall contributing to Bombus declines (Thomson, 2016, 
2021).
2.6.4 Pesticides
Climate change may exacerbate adverse effects from exposure to pesticides, which 
already threatens pollinators, especially in agricultural landscapes (Stuligross 98 Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
and Williams, 2020). A semi-natural experiment with B. terrestris exploring the 
interaction between exposure to sublethal levels of the neonicotinoid insecticide, 
clothianidin and temperature found that bees exposed to the pesticide and 
higher temperatures exhibited decreased foraging bouts, whereas bees without 
exposure to the pesticide were unaffected by temperature (Kolano et al., 2021).
2.6.5 Pathogens and parasites
By altering the distribution of species, climate change may bring new species 
into contact with pathogens that they have not evolved tolerance to, making 
them highly susceptible to severe negative impacts of novel viruses, bacteria 
and parasites. Additionally, when organisms are under stress, such as thermal 
stress, they can have lowered immune defences, leading them more vulnerable 
to infection or adverse impacts from pathogens. The majority of research on 
interactions between climate and disease has, similar to most threatening 
processes, focused on the non-threatened, domesticated A. mellifera. Whether 
we can extrapolate to other bees is questionable given their largely different 
life-history strategies. Climate change may facilitate shifts in honeybee pest 
distribution, such as the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida), or cause changes 
in the developmental cycle leaving it vulnerable to Tropileaps mite (Le Conte 
and Navajas, 2008).
Considering inter-species interactions is particularly important, as research 
has found that whilst some pollinators may benefit from the direct effects of 
warmer temperatures, this is nullified by the detrimental impacts warming has, 
thereby favouring predators, pathogens or parasites. This was demonstrated 
in research conducted over 3 years on the subalpine solitary cavity-nesting 
oligolectic bee,  Osmia iridis. Whilst increased ambient temperatures were 
correlated with increased availability of floral resources leading to increased 
rates of nest provisioning, this did not translate to increased reproductive 
output. This was because reproductive output was most strongly constrained 
by increased rates of brood parasitism by Sapyga wasps under increased 
temperatures (Forrest and Chisholm, 2017).
3 Advancing our understanding of climate change 
impacts on pollinators
To date, most information on the impacts of climate change has been biased 
towards Bombus species. Solitary bee species, despite comprising the majority 
of bee species, have been less well researched. There has also been a strong 
Northern Hemisphere bias.
Whilst a challenge, understanding how climate change impacts whole 
communities is needed as species do not exist in single plant–pollinator pairs, © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators 99
but rather interact within a network. Climate change impacts on plant–pollinator 
networks are relatively understudied, but studies looking at natural variation 
have found that during dry seasons, networks become more vulnerable to 
disturbance due to the smaller pool of floral hosts available to pollinators 
(Rabeling et al., 2019). To prevent cascading extinctions, identifying keystone 
species that maintain robustness in the face of drought and climatic extremes 
may help target conservation efforts.
As has been evident in my review here, species do not respond uniformly 
to climate change. Trait-based approaches have provided insights into which 
guilds of bees respond differentially to threatening processes or environmental 
variables (Prendergast et al., 2021, De Palma et al., 2015), and will be valuable 
in identifying ‘winners’ and ‘losers’, so as to target conservation at the most 
at-risk species or predict shifts in pollinator community composition.
Common to wild bee conservation as a whole, for many pollinator species 
predicting the population-level impacts of climate change remains an extreme 
challenge as we lack basic baseline information regarding what variables limit 
populations. Greater investment into natural history observations of species, 
such as the cues that trigger emergence, or the suite of floral resources a 
species uses would be helpful and a greater understanding of the distribution of 
species is required. Again, whilst this information is relatively well documented 
in Europe and the USA, it is extremely poorly documented in other regions 
such as Australia, South America, Asia and Africa. Long-term monitoring with 
appropriate methods, and investment in taxonomic expertise (Prendergast 
and Hogendoorn, 2021), is also necessary to accurately document changes in 
populations sizes or assemblage composition under climatic changes.
A review of impacts of climate change on insects concluded that what 
matters is not just the trends in climate parameters, such as average warming, 
but also the variance, as well as frequency and intensity of extreme events 
(Boggs, 2016). As such, more dynamic models may be required.
Climate-change-induced altered timing, distributions, population declines 
and changing interactions of flower-visiting taxa may impair pollination 
services. Of greatest concern are flora with restricted ranges, and highly 
specialised pollination mutualisms. This has been studied in the sexually 
deceptive orchid Leporella fimbriata, which relies on a single pollen vector, an 
ant Myrmecia urens (Kolanowska et al., 2021). Modelling the niches of both 
plant and pollinator under climate change, whilst the orchid’s distribution will 
be relatively unaffected, that of the ant will be considerably reduced, leading 
to a decrease in spatial overlap. Given that there are no alternative pollinators 
to fill this niche, this could pose a major threat to the persistence of L. fimbriata
and lead to local extinctions.
Economically important plant species may also suffer from reduced 
pollination services under climate change, with research again emphasising 100 Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators

that predicting impacts of climate change on any given species must include 
its ecological partners. Combining ecological niche models with simulations of 
tree cover loss and dispersal constraints, the forecasted distribution of Brazil 
nut tree (Bertholletia excels) was expected to increase by up to 6% by 2090. 
However, the Brazil nut tree was projected to suffer from reductions in the 
co-occurrence of its pollinator taxa (16 wild bee species) by up to almost 80%, 
with these mutualists suffering a loss of almost 50% of suitable habitat (Sales 
et al., 2021). Pollinator richness was also projected to decrease by 20%, which 
may also cause losses in pollination services due to loss of redundancy and 
resilience on pollination networks.
Already climate change mismatches between plants and pollinators are 
having consequences for plant reproduction. Earlier snowmelt in Japan is 
advancing flower onset of the spring ephemeral Corydalis ambigua and the 
emergence of queen Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis, a major pollinator. However, 
the plant was responding to a greater extent than the bee; so the earlier the snow 
melts, the greater the phenological mismatch, whereby flowering of C. ambigua
commenced up to 1 week earlier than bee emergence (Kudo and Cooper, 
2019). This had direct impacts on plant reproduction, where seed set in natural 
populations was approximately 60% with a minimal mismatch, but dropped to 
approximately 30% with a week mismatch. Experimental manipulations revealed 
this phenological mismatch arose due to plants and pollinators responding to 
different cues: flowering phenology of C. ambigua was determined by snowmelt 
date and subsequent ambient temperature; in contrast, bee emergence 
responded to belowground temperature, and following emergence, foraging 
activity was influenced by air temperature. It can be anticipated this mismatch 
will not only detriment plant fitness but also pollinator fitness: although Bombus
are polylectic, spring ephemerals like C. ambigua are important for queens 
emerging from hibernation and produce large volumes of nectar.
Species can adapt and evolve in unexpected ways to climate change, 
including altering their morphology. Whilst this may be adaptive for the 
pollinator or the plant, it may harm the other partner in the mutualism. These 
complex responses were demonstrated in a study looking at morphological 
changes in two long-tongued bees, Bombus balteatus and Bombus sylvicola, 
from specimens collected from 1966 to 1980 and from 2012 to 2014 in the 
central Rocky Mountains (Miller-Struttmann et al., 2015). Between these two 
periods, over the 40 years, tongue length decreased by 0.61% annually and 
24.4% cumulatively. These decreases in tongue length were not correlated 
with decreasing body size, competition from subalpine invaders, nor, as could 
be anticipated, coevolution with floral traits. Instead, the reduction in tongue 
length was associated with decreased floral resources occurring under warmer 
summers, which favoured a more generalised foraging strategy, with the species 
expanding their foraging niches compared with historical data. This strategy © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators 101
may enable the Bombus species to cope with climate change; however, it may 
have implications for flowers in the community which have long corollas, as 
they may suffer reduced pollination services.
4 Conserving pollinators under climate change
There has been scant research into testing how management actions may aid 
in protecting pollinators under climate change. Research has emphasised that 
providing good foraging resources (in quantity and quality) may ameliorate 
the negative impacts of climate change (and other stressors in general). An 
experiment with B. terrestris colonies demonstrated that whilst heat stress 
reduced colony development, resulting in a lower investment in offspring 
production, especially for small colonies, when small colonies were fed with high￾quality diets (dominated by Salix, demonstrated as an excellent resource for B. 
terrestris colony development, with high total amino acid content), the adverse 
effects of heat stress were much less pronounced (Vanderplanck et al., 2019).
Given that research has found climate change and other threats can 
interact synergistically, reducing other stressors such as exposure to toxic 
pesticides, crop monocultures, lack of suitable wildflowers and nutritional 
stress, and pathogens may allow bee populations to be more resilient to 
ongoing climate change pressures. Species can also evolve adaptively under 
the natural selection pressures climate change poses, but this has been little 
studied, and how evolution will occur among multiple, interacting partners 
is challenging to predict (Gilman et al., 2012). Nevertheless, so that genetic 
drift does not counteract positive natural selection, we can assist populations 
to adapt to climate change by ensuring they have higher effective population 
sizes (enhancing population abundance and ensuring populations do not 
become isolated and inbred) (Packer and Owen, 2001).
As outlined earlier, one major way that organisms can respond to 
climate change is to migrate to stay within their climatic envelope. Such 
adaptive shifts in distribution rely upon suitable, continuous habitat, which is 
becoming increasingly rare as humans fragment natural landscapes through 
anthropogenic land use – namely urban and agricultural development (Aizen 
and Feinsinger, 1994, 2003; Botsch et al., 2017; Brosi et al., 2008; Donaldson 
et al., 2002; Hung et al., 2017). To provide pollinators with the best chance 
to migrate, habitat needs to be preserved and restored. There have been 
no explicit climate change pollinator corridors established; however, there 
are increasing incentives in agricultural and urban areas to create pollinator 
corridors. Such corridors, or pollinator highways, are important for connecting 
high-quality habitats, and enabling species to move through otherwise 
inhospitable landscape matrixes (Griffin and Haddad, 2021, Gutiérrez-Chacón 
et al., 2019).102 Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators

Shifts in species’ distributions under climate change, and changes in 
habitat suitability, means we cannot be assured that protecting habitats 
where species currently occur will remain important habitats for them in the 
future. Increasing the overall area of legislatively protected habitat therefore 
is needed.
At present, efforts to predict the impacts of climate change have largely 
relied on retrospective studies looking at shifts in historical to contemporary 
distributions or phenology, lab-based manipulations or modelling approaches. 
Translocation approaches also have drawbacks, but experiments translocating 
plants and/or pollinators outside of their current ranges in space and time may 
allow proactive management, and empirically test model predictions on how 
populations will fare in novel niche spaces (Morton and Rafferty, 2017).
Furthermore, in the vertebrate and plant realm, assisted migration or 
assisted translocation has been advocated as a proactive measure to enable 
species to stay within their climate envelope (Gallagher et al., 2015). Such 
proposals are not without dissidents, especially when species are moved 
outside their historic range; however, they also hold great promise (Prendergast, 
2020b). There have been no plans for assisted migration of wild pollinators, 
but provided risks of disease and disruption of plant–pollinator networks of 
the resident community are considered, this may be a vital tool to prevent 
climate-change-mediated extinction of vulnerable species. However, any 
assisted migration must be approached with scientific vigour and should not 
be undertaken without a careful appraisal of the potential risks (Prendergast, 
2020b), such as introduced species becoming invasive and exerting negative 
impacts on the recipient community (Mueller and Hellmann, 2008).
Given known reductions in rainfall, a common call to action for conserving 
pollinators is to put out water. However, this may not accrue any major benefits 
since most bees obtain all the moisture they need from nectar, instead favouring 
the competitive honeybees, which need water to evaporatively cool their hive.
Conservation of biological diversity will provide insurance and resilience 
for pollination services under climate change (Senapathi et al., 2021, Bartomeus 
et al., 2013). Because species do not respond uniformly to the various 
components of climate change, it is imperative to conserve biological diversity, 
at the species level as well as intraspecific genetic diversity.
Climate change has been noted to exacerbate the impact of competition, 
and therefore minimising these adverse inter-species interactions for at-risk 
species should be a priority. A. mellifera has received much public, financial 
and media attention due to its economic importance, and the fact that it is a 
widespread, adaptable species (Wood et al., 2020, Iwasaki and Hogendoorn, 
2021). However, this mass-managed species can outcompete wild bees 
and have disruptive impacts on plant–pollinator networks (Prendergast and 
Ollerton, 2021a, Prendergast et al., 2021, Geslin et al., 2017, Thomson, 2016, © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators 103
Aizen and Feinsinger, 1994, Aizen et al., 2008). During ‘crunch’ times when 
resources become scarce due to drought, these competitive impacts may 
be particularly detrimental to native bee fitness. Consequently, regulating 
honeybee densities, and ensuring there are areas dedicated to native bee 
needs can help mitigate the potential for adverse impacts of competition from 
honeybees under climate change.
Of course, the greatest action that we can all take is addressing climate 
change itself by reducing humanity’s carbon footprint. This means less land 
clearing, and planting more plants, especially trees which capture large amounts 
of carbon (Donkersley, 2019) e.g. through agro-forestry (Kay et al., 2020). This 
can be a win-win if trees are planted that are highly attractive to bees, such 
as Eucalyptus and Corymbia in Australia (Prendergast and Ollerton, 2021b), 
Croton floribundus in Brazil (Ramalho, 2004), or Acer platanoides in Germany 
(Hausmann et al., 2015). Reducing the demand for environmentally destructive 
practices is also important, and as consumers, we can all do this by reducing 
or eliminating meat consumption, given how livestock farming is a major driver 
of land clearing, especially meat production that results in replacement of 
forested habitats and wildflower fields with non-entomophilous grasslands and 
grain pastures, and livestock’s major contribution to greenhouse gas emissions 
(Prendergast, 2020c, Poore and Nemecek, 2018).
Climate change may be the greatest threat jeopardising wild bees. 
Indeed, a recent study analysing a long-term dataset of wild bee occurrences 
across three states in Northeast USA revealed that climate factors emerged as 
being even more significant drivers of wild bee abundance and richness than 
landscape composition and quality (Kammerer et al., 2021). In particular, spring 
and summer/fall wild bee abundance and species richness were influenced to 
a greater extent by temperature and precipitation than landscape composition, 
quality or topography. Climate change predictions of warmer winters, a greater 
intensity of rainfall in winter and spring, and higher maximum temperatures 
are expected to decrease bee abundance and have variable effects on species 
richness. Not all taxa were equally sensitive, with Osmia (spring bees) being 
particularly associated with lower abundance under higher precipitation. For 
the summer/fall bee community, solitary bees were more susceptible than 
eusocial bees to decline in abundance following hot summers and to decrease 
in species richness under drought conditions.
5 Conclusion
Climate change is one of the greatest threats biodiversity is facing now and into 
the future. The impacts on pollinators have the potential to be dire, with flow-on 
effects for the wider ecosystem, including agroecosystems that humans depend 
on for nutrition. In the worst-case scenario, populations and species of pollinators 104 Assessing climate change impacts on pollinators

will become extinct, which may result in pollination deficits, but most importantly, 
a loss of unique, irreplaceable components of the diversity that has evolved on 
earth (Prendergast, 2020a). There is, however, the potential for pollinators and 
pollination networks to be buffered by plastic or genetic responses, or for novel 
interactions to occur, and some species will even benefit from climate change.

Chapter 5
Assessing the impact of disease 
on pollinators
Patrycja Pluta and Robert J. Paxton, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany
1 Introduction
Spurred by the report of a sensational 75% loss of insect biomass over a period 
of 27 years around the city of Krefeld in northwest Germany (Hallmann et al., 
2017), more recent analyses of insect trends strongly support a worldwide 
decline in terrestrial insect biodiversity as well as biomass (van Klink et al., 
2020; Wagner et al., 2021). As insects, particularly bees, are the most important 
pollinators of the majority of crops requiring pollination (Klein et al., 2007) and 
as there is an ongoing agricultural expansion of pollinator-dependent crops 
(Aizen et al., 2019), the decline of insects has obvious negative implications for 
pollination and crop yields in agricultural settings.
Insect decline is often seen as a multifactorial problem, itself associated 
with agricultural expansion (Raven and Wagner, 2021). Chief among the factors 
causing the decline of insect pollinators are thought to be (i) lack of habitat and 
associated essential resources (flowers providing pollen and nectar, suitable 
nesting sites), (ii) pesticides and (iii) disease organisms (Brown and Paxton, 
2009; Vanbergen and the Insect Pollinators Initiative, 2013; Goulson et al., 
2015; Potts et al., 2016). The relative importance of these three likely varies from

pollinator species to pollinator species, though pests and pathogens feature 
prominently (Dicks et al., 2021).
In agricultural settings, where managed bees such as the ubiquitous western 
honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) are typically employed for pollination (McGregor, 
1976; Kevan et al., 1990; Free, 1993; Delaplane and Mayer, 2000), two factors 
may promote the impact of pathogens: host density and host dispersal. Firstly, 
elevated densities can facilitate pathogen transmission and theoretically result 
in higher disease prevalence (Anderson and May, 1981). Pollinators are often 
promoted in or near crops requiring pollination (Free, 1993), and their increased 
density clearly represents a threat in terms of enhanced disease transmission 
to conspecifics and, through pathogen spillover, to heterospecifics (Gisder 
and Genersch, 2017). Secondly, translocation has led to the dispersal and 
subsequent emergence of many pathogens in plants, animals and humans 
(Daszak et al., 2000). Pollinators are not exempt. The transport of managed 
pollinators, particularly Apis mellifera and the bumble bee Bombus terrestris, 
is likely to blame for the dispersal and emergence of infectious diseases that 
threaten conspecifics and heterospecifics (Cameron et al., 2011; Schmid￾Hempel et al., 2014; Wilfert et al., 2016) alike, with knock-on consequences for 
the supply of pollination services to crops.
In this chapter we focus on diseases and their impact on insect pollinators; 
the direct impacts of habitat (degradation and loss) and pesticides are dealt 
with elsewhere in this book. We furthermore focus on bee pests and pathogens 
(disease-causing organisms) because of the importance of bees in crop 
pollination (Klein et al., 2007) and because most is known about their pests and 
pathogens.
2 A bestiary of honey bee diseases
Apis mellifera is arguably the best monitored of insects and numerically the 
most important commercial pollinator worldwide. The world stock of beehives 
(colonies) has grown consistently over the past 6 decades to around 90 million 
in the last 4 years (2016–2019; see Fig. 1a), likely driven by the agricultural 
expansion in pollinator-dependent crops (Aizen et al., 2008; Aizen and Harder, 
2009). The logic of the argument is that farmers growing more, or a greater 
area of, pollinator-dependent crops like almonds and apples may pay for 
pollination services, encouraging beekeeping as an economic activity and 
thereby boosting the number of managed honey bee colonies.
Although these data might suggest that we should not be concerned 
about the world’s population of honey bees, they belie the high annual colony 
losses suffered by beekeepers over the past 2 decades, particularly in Northern 
temperate regions of the world (Osterman et al., 2021). The massive die-off of 
US honey bees in the winter of 2006/2007 brought the issue of colony losses to © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

world media and political attention (Oldroyd, 2007). Since 2007, North America 
has reported annual (overwinter) colony losses of 26%, including >40% losses 
in the last 3 years (2017/2018, 2018/2019, 2019/2020; https://beeinformed
.org/citizen-science/loss-and-management-survey/) whilst those in Europe 
since 2007 have been around 16%, all well above 11% elsewhere in the world 
(Osterman et al., 2021) or the ‘normal’ expected mortality of ca. 10% (Chauzat 
et al., 2016). Part of the apparent discrepancy between the upward trend in the 
standing stock of honey bee colonies and high annual losses is because colony 
gains are in subtropical or tropical regions of the world (China, South America; 
Fig. 1b), whereas losses are in Northern temperate regions (Osterman et al., 
2021), part is because beekeepers make up for colony losses by multiplying 
their surviving colonies.
Regardless of these arguments over global colony dynamics, there is 
widespread consensus that disease organisms (pests and pathogens) are 
a major cause of elevated honey bee colony mortality (Cox-Foster et al., 
2007; Genersch et al., 2010; Johnson, 2010; Staveley et al., 2014; Barron, 
2015; Chauzat et al., 2016). We now describe the major disease organisms 
of honey bees and their impact on hosts (for summary, see Table 1). Our 
list is not comprehensive; e.g. we have not addressed the havoc currently 
wreaked on honey bees by Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) predation in NW 
Europe (Keeling et al., 2017). Rather, we focus on pests and pathogens with 
a broad distribution or with the potential to cause considerable harm in the 
near future.

2.1 Ectoparasitic mites
Social insects have long been known to harbour a diversity of parasitic mites, 
and the honey bee is no exception (Eickwort, 1990). We briefly detail three 
ectoparasitic mites of honey bees that are particularly well studied, in part 
because of their very serious impact on honey bee health.
2.1.1 Varroa destructor
The exotic mite Varroa destructor is a well-known ectoparasite of honey bees, 
present in almost every apiary worldwide, with the exception of Australia 
(Traynor et al., 2020). Successfully tolerated by its original host, the eastern honey

bee Apis cerana, after jumping over to Apis mellifera the mite has been held 
responsible – directly or indirectly – for the elevated colony losses of managed 
honey bees (Cox-Foster et al., 2007; Genersch et al., 2010; Rosenkranz et al., 
2010; Nazzi and Le Conte, 2016).
A direct, detrimental effect of the mite is caused by its feeding behaviour. 
The parasite invades host pupae in brood cells as well as adult honey bees and 
feeds on their haemolymph and fat bodies (Ramsey et al., 2019), resulting in 
lowered body weight and water content. Heavy infestation of the brood cells 
may result in the death of pupae. Low body weight is associated with decreased 
sperm production in drones, which hampers their reproductive performance 
(Duay et al., 2002) and subsequently queen reproductivity. Feeding by mites on 
adult workers results in flight impairment of the host (Duay et al., 2002) and loss 
of orientation, thus severely affecting homing (Kralj and Fuchs, 2006). Besides 
the effects inflicted on individuals, varroa mites compromise the colony; 
the decreased number of emerging honey bees, coupled with the lower 
performance of foragers and reproductives (queens and drones), inexorably 
leads to colony decline (Neumann and Carreck, 2010).
Although varroa mites alone can potentially impair colony fitness, the major 
threat they pose arises from the pathogens – particularly viruses – they transmit 
whilst feeding on hosts (Yang and Cox-Foster, 2005; Neumann and Carreck, 
2010). To date, a plethora of viruses is thought to be vectored by varroa mites 
(Levin et al., 2019; Beaurepaire et al., 2020; Yañez et al., 2020), some of which elicit 
severe disease. The presence of V. destructor has therefore shaped the current 
distribution of mite-transmitted viruses across the world, facilitating viral spread 
and, through a change in the route of viral transmission, leading to increased 
severity of viral disease (virulence) (Martin et al., 2012; Mondet et al., 2014).
Three other Varroa species, jacobsoni, rindereri and underwoodi, are 
known from south and east Asian honey bee species, though they are rarely 
associated with Apis mellifera (Chantawannakul et al., 2016). The exception is 
V. jacobsoni that parasitises Apis mellifera colonies in Papua New Guinea. Two 
Euvarroa species, sinhai and wongsirii, are hosted by Asian honey bees and 
occasionally by Apis mellifera imported into the region, though the biology of 
these mites is less well known (Chantawannakul et al., 2016) and their impacts 
on hosts are likely modest.
2.1.2 Tropilaelaps spp.
Tropilaelaps is a genus of ectoparasitic mite whose primary hosts are honey 
bee species native to tropical and subtropical south and east Asia, but which 
can now also be found on Apis mellifera imported into the region (de Guzman 
et al., 2017). Despite their high rates of reproduction than can exceed those of 
varroa mites, they have not (yet) been recorded widely outside of their native 118 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

range. Of four known species in the genus Tropilaelaps, namely mercedesae, 
clerae, thaii and koenigerum, the first two are the most prevalent and have 
successfully jumped over to Apis mellifera after its introduction to South and 
East Asia (Chantawannakul et al., 2016). The primary host of T. mercedesae
is Apis dorsata, a widely distributed honey bee species of South and East 
Asia (Smith, 1991). Contrastingly, T. clerae and its primary hosts, Apis dorsata 
binghami and Apis breviligula, are restricted in distribution, and thus the mite is 
less prevalent than T. mercedesae. Tropilaelaps thaii and T. koenigerum are less 
well known (for further details, see Chantawannakul et al., 2016).
Tropilaelaps spp. and V. destructor share similarities in the life cycle, 
feeding behaviour and negative effects on honey bee hosts. An important 
distinction between these two mite genera is the inability of Tropilaelaps spp. 
to feed on adult honey bees due to their soft chelicerae (mouthparts) (Koeniger 
et al., 1988). This drastically shortens mite survivorship outside brood cells. This 
difference in biology means that Tropilaelaps spp. may not be able to spread 
to temperate regions of the world where honey bees enter a broodless period 
during the winter months.
Colonies infested with Tropilaelaps spp. mites suffer from a decreased 
number of emerging workers; those that do emerge are often crippled and 
weakened. The immunity of individual hosts is diminished due to direct 
damage by mite feeding and the lack of proteins that are harvested by the 
mite from pupal haemolymph (Khongphinitbunjong et al., 2015). The health 
status of a single, parasitised honey bee projects onto the general fitness of 
the colony and heavy infestation can lead to colony collapse. Tropilaelaps
spp. mites, such as varroa mites, vector honey bee viruses (Dainat et al., 2009; 
Forsgren et al., 2009).
2.1.3 Acarapis woodi
Acarapis woodi is a microscopic parasitic mite inhabiting the tracheal tubes of 
young honey bees and the base of the wings of older honey bees, whose stiff 
tracheal hairs are too hard for the mite to penetrate into the host’s tracheae. 
Initially discovered in the United Kingdom in the early 1900s, the mite has been 
reported across all continents (Matheson, 1993), although in many countries 
Acarapis woodi outbreaks occur only sporadically. Currently, it is not widely 
reported (Traynor et al., 2016), possibly because of widespread miticide use to 
treat colonies against varroa mites. The life cycle of Acarapis woodi is limited 
(exclusively for males and almost exclusively for females) to tracheal tubes, 
where mites pierce the tracheal tubes to feed on host haemolymph, with a short 
outside phoretic period reserved for post-mating host switching by females. 
Acarapisosis usually proceeds covertly and elicits symptoms only after heavy 
infestation. Affected honey bees are unable to fly and can be seen crawling © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

around the hive floor, the wings may be displaced and the abdomens are 
elongated.
2.2 Viruses
Honey bees host a rich diversity of viruses. To date, over 70 have been associated 
with them (McMenamin and Genersch, 2015; Grozinger and Flenniken, 2019; 
Beaurepaire et al., 2020), though only a small fraction of them has been studied 
in any depth. Most honey bee viruses are short (ca. 10 kb), positive sense, single￾stranded RNA or (+)ssRNA viruses that produce a negative RNA strand using 
the machinery of the host cell to replicate. Because of their small genome size, 
they lack a good mechanism of RNA repair during replication and therefore 
have high mutation rates and likely a high capacity to evolve and adapt, e.g. to 
a change in transmission pathway or to novel hosts (Holmes, 2009).
2.2.1 Deformed wing virus
The best-studied (Martin and Brettell, 2019) and arguably the most important 
virus in terms of its impact, deformed wing virus (DWV), has long been reported 
in honey bees, even before varroa infestation (Bailey and Ball, 1991). The mite’s 
presence changed DWV’s main route of transmission from (presumed) faecal–
oral to indirect via the varroa mite as a vector (Yañez et al., 2020). This change 
precipitated a dramatic increase in DWV’s prevalence (number of infected 
colonies) and pathogen load (amount of virus per honey bee) (Martin et al., 
2012; Mondet et al., 2014) as well as virulence (harm caused to the host) (Bowen￾Walker et al., 1999; Nazzi et al., 2012; Di Prisco et al., 2016). DWV is notoriously 
found in collapsing colonies and is associated with high overwinter mortality 
rates in honey bees (Dainat et al., 2012; Francis et al., 2013; Natsopoulou et al., 
2017). DWV and its transmission by varroa mites are therefore the leading 
causes of elevated honey bee colony mortality in the past 2 decades, at least in 
temperate regions of the world.
DWV, a (+)ssRNA virus, belongs to the family Iflaviridae (Picornavirales) and 
comprises three variants or genotypes: the first detected genotype A (Bailey 
and Ball, 1991), genotype B, previously known as Varroa destructor virus 1 (VDV￾1) (Ongus et al., 2004), and genotype C, the most recently discovered although 
rarely reported (Mordecai et al., 2016). Current opinion is that DWV-genotype 
A (DWV-A) is merely mechanically transmitted to honey bees, whereas DWV￾genotype B (DWV-B) can also replicate inside V. destructor and therefore 
the mite acts as a biological vector for it (Gisder and Genersch, 2021). These 
subtleties aside, it is important to bear in mind that both DWV-A and DWV-B 
are virulent when vectored by varroa mites and can lead to colony collapse 
(McMahon et al., 2016).120 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
In line with the nature of other RNA viruses, DWV is characterised by 
high rates of mutation and recombination, which potentially result in the 
development of new variants and recombinants (Moore et al., 2011; Ryabov 
et al., 2014). The comparative virulence among DWV genotypes is currently 
unclear. Whilst laboratory experiments demonstrate higher virulence of DWV-B 
over that of genotype A in adults (McMahon et al., 2016; for field experiments, 
see also Norton et al., 2021), there is no obvious fitness or mortality differences 
between genotypes in pupae (Tehel et al., 2019). Initial mild and covert 
infections transmitted via the oral route are aggravated when the virus is 
injected directly into the haemolymph/haemocoel of honey bee pupae 
or adults by the mite. The classic symptom of DWV is the presence of wing 
deformities in emerging honey bees when these have been infected as pupae 
(by varroa feeding), although the pathogenesis of DWV remains unclear; high 
viral titres can also be found in freshly emerging honey bees with normal wings 
(Tehel et al., 2019; Gusachenko et al., 2020). Honey bees infected as adults 
clearly cannot exhibit deformed wings because their wings were already fully 
formed during pupation. The lack of penetrance of the trait ‘deformed wings’ in 
freshly emerging honey bees and the lack of other clear DWV symptoms make 
it difficult to recognise that a colony of honey bees is suffering from a DWV 
infection. DWV prevalence is typically very high (Genersch et al., 2010; Traynor 
et al., 2016); potentially all colonies are infected when infested by varroa mites.
2.2.2 Acute bee paralysis virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus and 
Kashmir bee virus
Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and Kashmir 
bee virus (KBV) are a group of very closely related (+)ssRNA viruses in the 
family Dicistroviridae (Bailey et al., 1963; for review: de Miranda et al., 2010). 
All three may cause covert infections and maintain low viral titres. However, all 
three, like DWV, can be transmitted by varroa mites (Chen et al., 2004; Ball and 
Allen, 1988); varroa mite transmission serves as an activator of viral replication, 
leading to acute onset with a dramatic increase in mortality and colony loss 
(Ball and Allen, 1988).
Typical symptoms of infection by these Dicistroviridae include impaired 
flight, trembling progressing to paralysis and loss of hair, which gives honey bees 
a dark appearance. These characteristics, however, can be difficult to notice at 
the colony level due to the rapid death of diseased individuals. ABPV has been 
suggested as a cause of high honey bee mortality since the host shift of varroa 
mites to Apis mellifera (Ball and Allen, 1988; Bakonyi et al., 2002). Moreover, 
IAPV was one of the main suspects of so-called Colony Collapse Disorder (the 
mass die-off of colonies) that took North American beekeepers and scientists 
by surprise with a sudden wave of colony depopulation in winter 2006/2007 © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 121
(vanEngelsdorp et al., 2009). However, these three viruses are so virulent when 
transmitted by varroa mites that they kill pupae in the pupal stage, where they 
die un-opened. In the short term, then, these viruses can lead to colony loss. But, 
in the long term, they are so virulent when vectored by varroa mites that they 
are not transmitted by infected pupae because pupae die in their sealed brood 
cells. In effect, these viruses eliminate themselves from a honey bee population 
(Martin, 2001; Sumpter and Martin, 2004; McMahon et al., 2018) and their 
prevalence is typically very low (Genersch et al., 2010; Traynor et al., 2016).
2.2.3 Slow bee paralysis virus
Slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV) is a (+)ssRNA virus of the family Iflavirus 
infecting a variety of bees, managed and wild (de Miranda et al., 2010). 
Transmission by varroa mites results in high viral titres and subsequent high 
colony mortality (Carreck et al., 2010). Other routes of transmission result in 
only covert infections. Affected honey bees exhibit paralysis in two anterior leg 
pairs 10 days after infection. After a spike in mortality closely following varroa 
introduction (Carreck, 2005; Carreck et al., 2010), SBPV is now considered a 
rare virus (McMahon et al., 2015) and has not been detected in a multi-year 
survey of honey bees in the United States (Traynor et al., 2016).
2.2.4 Chronic bee paralysis virus
Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) is an unclassified (+)ssRNA virus with wide 
distribution and apparently increasing prevalence (Traynor et al., 2016). It 
has a distinct set of symptoms comprised of two syndromes that may occur 
simultaneously in the colony; type 1 syndrome is characterised by trembling, 
paralysis, distended abdomen and loss of flight ability (crawling). Type 2 
syndrome results in loss of hair on the abdomen, which gives honey bees a 
black, shiny appearance (Dittes et al., 2020a). Moreover, affected honey bees 
are refused entry to the hive and can even be attacked by healthy hive-mates, 
which may create an illusion to beekeepers of robbing. The symptomatic 
similarity to ABPV lessens with the length of host survival; CBPV-affected honey 
bees can live for several days, whereas honey bees infected with ABPV die 
already after 1–2 days. Despite its noticeable symptoms, CBPV is rarely thought 
to result in the collapse of a colony but can impair its performance due to a lack 
of healthy, capable worker honey bees.
2.2.5 Sacbrood virus
Sacbrood virus (SBV) is another varroa-transmitted (+)ssRNA virus in the family 
Iflaviridae (Shen et al., 2005). Its name derives from the typical appearance of 122 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

infected honey bee larvae which fail to pupate, accumulating fluid within the 
unshed skin, which resembles a sac. Subsequently, the dead larvae dry out 
and darken, acquiring a gondola-like shape and forming a scale at the base 
of the brood cell. Loss of brood at the point of pupation places the colony in 
a disadvantageous position; not enough new worker honey bees emerge to 
provide care and supplies (pollen and nectar) for the colony. Covert infections 
in adult honey bees facilitate the spread of the virus to other larvae through 
feeding (Beaurepaire et al., 2020). Similar to DWV, SBV is prone to mutation and 
recombination, which results in the emergence of different variants with altered 
virulence (Huang et al., 2021b). Despite its global distribution (Beaurepaire 
et al., 2020) and the damage it inflicts on brood, SBV is not considered a major 
factor in the loss of Apis mellifera colonies.
2.2.6 Black queen cell virus
Black queen cell virus (BQCV) is a (+)ssRNA virus in the family Dicistrovirus that 
is widely distributed (Beaurepaire et al., 2020) and at high prevalence in honey 
bees (e.g. McMahon et al., 2015; Traynor et al., 2016). It has a primarily faecal–
oral transmission route and is apparently not transmitted by varroa mites. As 
suggested by the name, BQCV poses a threat to the queen-rearing industry, 
with high titres responsible for elevated mortality of queen larvae. Following 
their death, remnants of queen larvae acquire a black colour that stains the 
queen brood cell.
Although BQCV rarely results in symptomatic infections in managed hives, 
experimental infection of worker larvae results in high host mortality (Doublet 
et al., 2015), suggesting that the virus might exert a significant impact on colony 
health. BQCV, like the other Dicistroviridae ABPV, IAPV and KBV, is highly 
virulent when experimentally injected into host pupae and adults (Remnant 
et al., 2019; Al Naggar and Paxton, 2020). Research suggests a connection 
between infection of BQCV and the Microsporidian Nosema ceranae in 
adult honey bees; mixed infections result in higher mortality of adult workers 
(Doublet et al., 2015).
2.2.7 Novel viruses
Due to advances in molecular biological methods, and especially next￾generation sequencing technologies, myriad novel viruses have been detected 
in honey bees (Beaurepaire et al., 2020). Although distinguishing between 
viruses causing active infections and viruses passively present on or within 
honey bees is problematic, recent discoveries shed light on how abundant and 
diverse is the world of bee viruses.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

2.3 Fungi: Nosema spp. and chalkbrood
Nosema spp. are Microsporidia, highly derived spore-forming fungi that are 
intracellular parasites of animal hosts. The genus contains two highly honey 
bee-pathogenic species: Nosema apis, whose primary host is Apis mellifera, 
and Nosema ceranae, whose primary host is Apis cerana of south and east Asia 
but which has jumped host to Apis mellifera and is nowadays found across 
the world (Klee et al., 2007). Note that N. apis and N. ceranae have recently 
been reclassified to the genus Vairimorpha (Tokarev et al., 2020). Of many 
possible colony collapse culprits, Nosema spp. seconds the varroa mite and 
its associated viruses in the number of reported cases (e.g. Higes et al., 2008).
Nosema ceranae in Apis mellifera originally appeared better adapted to 
higher temperatures and to dominate in warm climates whilst N. apis retained 
its reign in cool temperate climates (Natsopoulou et al., 2015). More recent 
evidence suggests that N. ceranae may even dominate N. apis as a parasite of 
Apis mellifera in Canada’s cooler, northern climate (Emsen et al., 2016). Both 
species are characterised by seasonality, with higher incidence and spore loads 
reported in the spring. Both parasitise the adult host’s ventriculus (part of the 
gut), resulting in dysentery and within-hive defaecation, though experimental 
evidence suggests that N. ceranae may also infect larvae (Urbieta-Magro et al., 
2019). The disease may also progress furtively, with a sudden collapse of the 
colony. Symptoms such as a distended abdomen and loss of flight ability, which 
results in crawling behaviour, are often found in colonies heavily infected with 
N. ceranae. The comparative virulence of these two Nosema species in Apis 
mellifera varies across studies from slight to moderately higher virulence of N. 
ceranae (Milbrath et al., 2015; Natsopoulou et al., 2016). Nevertheless, both 
species may have deleterious effects on colony fitness and ultimately lead to its 
collapse (Higes et al., 2008).
A more recognisable fungal pathogen of honey bees is the spore-forming 
Ascosphaera apis, the causative agent of chalkbrood (Aronstein and Murray, 
2010). If spores are ingested by a honey bee larva, it then succumbs to the 
developing fungus, drying out to form a ‘mummy’ that seems to be covered in a 
white or mottled black-and-white ‘chalk’. Ascosphaera apis is likely omnipresent 
in Apis mellifera colonies, at least in temperate regions, and is thought to break 
out only under conditions stressful for larvae, particularly if they are chilled 
below 35°C during development.
2.4 Bacteria: American and European Foulbrood
The two most economically important bacterial diseases of honey bees, 
American Foulbrood (AFB) and European Foulbrood (EFB), are exclusively 
diseases of brood (larvae).124 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
AFB, caused by the Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium Paenibacillus 
larvae, is a worldwide disease of Apis mellifera known for its detrimental effects 
on colonies during, usually sudden, outbreaks (Hansen and Brødsgaard, 
1999; Genersch, 2010). It consists of four genotypes (ERIC I-IV), of which 
the first two are the most prevalent. Spores, the infectious form of P. larvae, 
are extremely resilient and capable of surviving for 60 or more years under 
harsh environmental conditions. AFB is highly contagious; less than a dozen 
spores are required to elicit an infection in a honey bee larva. Upon ingestion, 
the pathogen germinates and massively proliferates in the midgut. Typical 
symptoms are observed in capped brood, in which the cap sealing the cell 
is dark and concave. Excreted proteases decompose the larval body within, 
which transforms into a brown, colloid-like mass known as the ropey stage 
(with a fishy or foul smell, hence the name ‘foulbrood’). The remnants of the 
larva then dry, forming a scale that adheres to the floor of the brood cell, 
called the foulbrood scale. The classic symptoms are often obscured during 
infection with highly virulent strains (ERIC II-IV) by the rapid death of infected 
larvae before capping. Dead larvae are removed by worker honey bees and 
do not form foulbrood scales, producing an irregular brood pattern (so-called 
‘shotgun’ pattern), though this pattern can have a number of other causes, too 
(e.g. queen infertility). All four genotypes of AFB lead to almost 100% mortality 
in honey bee larvae, with the time of death varying from 7 to 12 days post￾infection. Infection can profoundly affect colony strength and lead to complete 
colony collapse.
EFB is caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Melissococcus plutonius, 
frequently accompanied by infection with other bacteria: Enterococcus faecalis, 
P. alvei and Achromobacter Euridice, the latter also commonly occurring in 
healthy honey bees (White, 1912; Forsgren, 2010). Affected honey bee larvae 
may die before capping and be removed from the hive or die post-capping, 
where the contagious material is preserved (and, when fresh, has a foul smell). 
The disease does not inflict 100% mortality; honey bee pupation, although 
delayed, may occur and result in the emergence of small, asymptomatic adults 
which serve as a bacterial reservoir. Sudden outbreaks of EFB disease are often 
followed by equally sudden recovery. The onset of symptoms may mirror a 
period of unfavourable weather conditions or lack of food resources. Similar to 
ABF, if EFB-infected larvae die, they first form a dark colloid-like mass which then 
dries into a scale. Co-infection with other bacteria may alter the characteristics 
of the disease, most notably changing the scent of decomposing larvae.
2.5 Trypansomes: Crithidia mellificae and Lotmaria passim
Despite growing interest in the Trypanosomatidae of honey bees, the pathogenicity 
of the two most prevalent members, Crithidia mellificae and Lotmaria passim,© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 125
remains elusive. The former seems well adapted to the warm and acidic gut of 
adult honey bees, whereas the latter may spill over from other hosts into honey 
bees (Palmer-Young et al., 2021). These gut-infesting kinetoplasts occur in two 
forms: flagellated, motile choanomastigote and non-flagellated amastigote. 
Studies report contradictory results regarding their impact on infected honey 
bees, although the outcome of disease might be highly dependent on the dose 
and the phase of the pathogen’s growth, which influences its infectivity (Gómez￾Moracho et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Few studies have linked trypanosomatids 
to colony collapse, although this needs further investigation (Cornman et al., 
2012; Ravoet et al., 2013). Crithidia mellificae and L. passim are often found in 
colonies infected with N. ceranae (Runckel et al., 2011), yet the nature of the 
interaction between these pathogens remains unclear.
2.6 Common pests: the small hive beetle and wax moths
The small hive beetle (Aethina tumida), a minor pest of African Apis mellifera (for 
review: Neumann and Ellis, 2008), came into the spotlight after its discovery in 
US honey bee hives in 1996. Although African honey bees seem to be resistant 
to infestation, European Apis mellifera in temperate climates seem to lack vital 
behavioural hygienic traits that can either prevent the beetle from entering the 
hive or facilitate its eradication (Ellis et al., 2004).
The life cycle of the small hive beetle is divided into the within-hive phase, 
when reproducing adults and wandering larvae feed on honey bee resources 
(honey and pollen stores), and a phase outside the hive in the soil, where larvae 
undergo pupation. The beetle can also survive and reproduce outside the hive 
by feeding on fruit. Even the strongest European Apis mellifera colonies seem 
to be powerless against the voracious beetle, with reports of colony collapse 
only 2 weeks after infestation.
Two species of wax moth (Lepidoptera and Pyralidae; see Table 1) infest 
old wax combs, which their larvae consume. They cause considerable damage 
to combs stored by beekeepers but do not usually represent a problem inside a 
hive because honey bee workers can effectively defend their nest against moths.
2.7 Measuring disease impact on honey bee colonies (and 
pollination)
A healthy colony can grow in size, and a large colony with a numerous worker 
force is likely to have a considerable number of forager honey bees that can 
act as pollinators. The size of a colony can be measured directly by visually 
quantifying the number of honey bees, brood, pollen and honey reserves, 
e.g. using the so-called Liebefeld method (Dainat et al., 2020), which can be 126 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

semi-automated through digital photography linked to AI-informed recognition 
software. Numerous fully automated devices that can operate remotely are 
nowadays also available on the market that record the weight of a colony and 
send the information in real time over the internet to a beekeeper’s digital 
device to report on colony health (Rafael Braga et al., 2020). Poor colony growth 
might suggest disease impact, which can be investigated through veterinary 
inspection (Dittes et al., 2020b), incorporating the use of molecular methods 
for pathogen detection so that the cause of poor colony health can be correctly 
diagnosed and an appropriate remedy deployed.
The regular inspection of honey bee colonies is an obligatory part 
of beekeeping, all the more so for commercial colonies managed for the 
pollination of crops. During the swarm season, which usually coincides with 
the spring/early summer flowering of many crop plants in temperate regions, 
hive inspections every 9 days are recommended so as to ensure that a colony 
does not swarm before the next inspection (Hooper, 1976). A hive inspection 
should include not only a check (i) on whether the colony is about to swarm 
(e.g. building of queen cells) but also (ii) for the presence of the queen (iii) 
that there are sufficient reserves of honey and (iv) sufficient space to store 
additional honey as well as (v) for diseases, i.e. through visual inspection of 
adult honey bees (for symptoms of viral infection – discoloration, trembling 
and deformed wings – and for varroa mites), of the brood (for foulbrood, 
chalkbrood, other fungal and viral diseases), of the stored honey and pollen 
(for the small hive beetle) and of hive debris on the hive’s bottom board. If 
disease is suspected, a full veterinary inspection can be undertaken (Dittes 
et al., 2020b).
Across temperate parts of its native range, most colonies of Apis mellifera
are managed and can be inspected as described above. Tropical parts of A. 
mellifera’s native range maintain large populations of wild colonies (Jaffé 
et al., 2010). This is also likely true of feral Africanized Apis mellifera in Latin 
America, where the feral population may exceed that of managed colonies 
even in localities such as the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, with one of the 
world’s highest densities of managed Apis mellifera colonies (Moritz et al., 
2013). It is very challenging to monitor the health of wild or feral colonies 
because the colony’s brood is often protected within a tree trunk or rock 
face. In such cases, disease presence can be determined by the molecular 
quantification of pathogens in honey bees collected from the hive entrance 
or its drones where they assemble for mating, high in the sky (Yañez et al., 
2012; Forfert et al., 2016). But measuring disease impact on colony size or 
performance per se (as in the number of exiting forager honey bees) can 
only be evaluated indirectly by quantifying the flow of honey bees into and 
out of a colony.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 127
3 The poorly known wild bee diseases
Concern over the decline of pollinators (and pollination) was initially focussed 
on wild species of insect and vertebrates such as wild bee species, humming 
birds and bats, and the wild plants they pollinate (Buchmann and Nabhan, 
1996). In-depth analysis of museum records subsequently revealed that wild 
bees have declined in diversity in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom 
(Biesmeijer et al., 2006). Garibaldi et al.’s (2013) landmark paper, highlighting 
the important role of wild bee (and other insects) species in the pollination 
of crops, has only served to draw more attention to the fate of wild bees and 
their conservation. A recent analysis of records held by the Global Biodiversity 
Information Facility (GBIF) has revealed that the decline in wild bee species 
diversity is a worldwide phenomenon (Zattara and Aizen, 2021).
Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are a social subset of ca. 260 of the world’s 
total ca. 20000 wild bee species that are rather charismatic because of their 
large size and characteristic, sometimes species-specific colour patterns. Of all 
wild bee taxa, they have therefore been relatively well studied. Monitoring data 
reveal that many Bombus spp. have declined in range over the past decades 
(Williams and Osborne, 2009; Cameron and Sadd, 2020), both in North America 
(Cameron et al., 2011) and in Europe (Nieto et al., 2014).
Another large group of wild bees, the eusocial (colony-forming) and 
pantropical stingless bees, are also considered important pollinators of 
numerous crop plants (Heard, 1999). There is a long history of management 
of some of these species back into antiquity; e.g. archaeological evidence 
suggests the Maya peoples have managed the Neotropical stingless bee 
Melipona beecheii for well over 2 millennia, and this and many other stingless 
bee species continue to be managed nowadays (Osterman et al., 2021). 
Stingless bee populations are thought to be in decline largely through habitat 
deterioration and destruction (Freitas et al., 2009); their pests and pathogens 
are less well known and deserve greater scrutiny. Because of the paucity of data 
on their diseases, we do not address them further in this chapter.
To what extent are pests and pathogens to blame for the decline of wild 
bees? In contrast to the relatively good knowledge of honey bee pests and 
pathogens, the disease organisms of wild bees are poorly researched, and 
there is little knowledge of the impact they may have on wild bee populations 
(Brown and Paxton, 2009). Exceptions are the few wild bee species that are 
managed for use in crop pollination: currently eight solitary bee species and 
nine Bombus taxa (Osterman et al., 2021). The scrutiny to which Bombus spp. 
have been subject to basic ecological and evolutionary research has also 
provided deeper insight into their pests and pathogens, comprehensively 
reviewed in Schmid-Hempel (1998). Evidence points to the important role of 
pathogens in wild bee decline (Dicks et al., 2021), particularly in the decline 128 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

of bumble bees (Cameron et al., 2011; Arbetman et al., 2017; Cameron and 
Sadd, 2020).
We now overview the major known pests and pathogens of (i) bumble 
bees (Table 2) and (ii) other managed and wild bee species (Table 3), which we 
collectively term solitary bees.
3.1 Bumble bees
Bombus comprises a genus of large-bodied social (or socially parasitic) bee 
species that are frequent visitors to flowers in temperate and cooler regions 
of the world (e.g. the Andes of South America), where they are considered 
important pollinators (Goulson, 2009). In addition, their large size and often

colourful adult patterns have attracted the attention of lay and scientists alike, 
contributing to the knowledge of their pests and parasites. Major diseases of 
bumble bees and their respective causative agents are given in Table 2.
3.1.1 The Microsporidia: Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae
Bumble bees are parasitised by a species-specific Microsporidian, Nosema 
bombi, which can be responsible for a drastic reduction in fertility (Otti and 
Schmid-Hempel, 2007). Its route of infection is faecal–oral, and ingested N. 
bombi spores can colonise the adult host’s intestine, Malpighian tubes and 
reproductive organs, causing diarrhoea, limiting sperm production in males 
and elevating mortality (Otti and Schmid-Hempel, 2007). Heavily diseased 
gynes (queen-destined females) and males have scarcely a chance of successful 
mating.
The honey bee Microsporidian Nosema ceranae is known to infect bumble 
bees, e.g. the common and widespread Bombus terrestris (Fürst et al., 2014), 
although consensus has not been reached yet on whether the detection of N. 
ceranae is mere contamination (the host may act as a mechanical vector) or 
reflects an actual infection (Gisder et al., 2020).

3.1.2 Widespread Protozoa: Crithidia bombi and Apicystis 
bombi
The trypanosomatid Crithidia bombi is a gut parasite of adult Bombus spp., 
transmitted by the faecal–oral route and often rising to high prevalence (Ruiz￾González et al., 2012). Although it does not inflict direct negative effects on the 
reproductive system of its hosts, infection leads to higher mortality of gynes, 
and their success rates are lower (Rutrecht and Brown, 2008). Furthermore, C. 
bombi can impair the cognitive function of worker bees and reduce foraging 
effectiveness. C. bombi often occurs in combination with other parasites, which 
further aggravates the effects of infection.
Apicystis bombi is a gregarine parasite of various bee species, with 
bumble bees considered to be its primary host. Oral ingestion of spores results 
in colonisation of the gut and fat body. Parasites reproduce in fat cells, causing 
the organ to lose its cream colour and become hypertrophic (swollen). It is 
considered a serious disease organism of adult bumble bees; affected gynes 
have a shortened lifespan, which hinders successful mating and thus colony 
establishment (Schoonvaere et al., 2020).
3.1.3 Viruses: Deformed wing virus, black queen cell virus and 
others
In recent years, increasing attention has been given to emerging infectious 
diseases in wild pollinators, including bumble bees (Fürst et al., 2014; Nanetti 
et al., 2021). Advanced molecular techniques have led to the discovery of 
typical honey bee viruses in bumble bees and other wild bees (Table 2), as well 
as the presence of a range of novel viruses that are seemingly associated with 
Bombus spp. (Pascall et al., 2019). Of the various honey bee-associated viral 
pathogens, two appear to be the most prevalent in Bombus spp., namely DWV 
and BQCV (Fürst et al., 2014; McMahon et al., 2015). Although not apparently 
as pathogenic as in their reservoir host Apis mellifera, DWV inflicts negative 
effects on Bombus spp. and has been reported to cause overt infection with 
characteristic ‘deformed wing’ symptoms (Genersch et al., 2006).
3.1.4 Other Eukaryote pests and parasites
The nematode Spherularia bombi is a serious parasite of Bombus spp. 
queens; it is not known to infect worker bumble bees. Queens are exposed 
to S. bombi during winter hibernation in the soil, when juvenile nematodes 
enter overwintering females and colonise the host’s haemocoel, draining 
host resources during and after hibernation. Infection results in impaired 
development of the host’s corpora allata and ovaries, usually terminating a © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 131
queen’s reproduction. Affected queens do not find nests after winter diapause 
but seek new places to overwinter, where they shed large numbers of juvenile￾stage S. bombi into the soil (Poinar and van der Laan, 1972). Infection with S. 
bombi is common in many Bombus spp. queens.
Bumble bees are associated with many mite species that vary in their 
supposed impact from parasitic (i.e. detrimental to host health) to beneficial 
(Alford, 1975). One relatively well-characterised mite is Locustacaris buchneri
(Table 2), a widely prevalent parasite of multiple bumble bee species which 
is found in the tracheal tubes of both queens and worker bees, where it feeds 
on the haemolymph of the host (Rutrecht and Brown, 2008). Yet the scarcity of 
research about L. buchneri means that little is known about its true impact on 
colony fitness and reproduction. This is true for many of the numerous mite 
species associated with bumble bees.
The parasitic wasp Syntretus sp. is considered a rare parasite of bumble 
bees. Females lay eggs within Bombus individuals, thereby developing 
offspring feed on the tissues of the host, quickly leading to its death. Syntretus
spp. may infest queens as well as workers, shortening their lifespan, reducing 
colony performance and potentially resulting in colony failure (Rutrecht and 
Brown, 2008).
The wax moth Aphomia sociella is considered a pest of bumble bee nests, 
especially those managed in artificial boxes. The ravenous larvae of A. sociella
feed on various resources of the colony, from pollen and wax to bee eggs and 
larvae. Heavy infestation can cause the death of the colony due to a lack of 
stored resources (pollen and honey) and workers.
Conopidae are a group of true flies (Diptera) that lay their eggs inside their 
hosts, usually other insects; the conopid egg hatches and consumes the host 
from inside, eventually killing it. Some conopid species specialise in parasitising 
Bombus spp., manipulating their host so that it digs underground to die, where 
the conopid can more successfully hibernate (Müller, 1994). They clearly exert 
a cost on host populations which can be quite profound in temperate regions 
as summer progresses, with up to 47% of host workers infected in one study 
(Schmid-Hempel et al., 1990).
3.1.5 Social parasites (cuckoo bumble bees of the subgenus 
Psithyrus)
Social parasitic bumble bee species (genus Bombus, subgenus Psithyrus; also 
known as cuckoo or inquiline bumble bees) usurp nests of other Bombus
species (termed ‘true’ bumble bees), often killing the host queen; host workers 
are thereby enslaved and provision the sexual offspring of the social parasite. 
Though socially parasitic Bombus (Psithyrus) spp. could theoretically regulate 
host populations, evidence from multiannual records in Great Britain suggests 132 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
little temporal fluctuation in social parasitism (Antonovics and Edwards, 2011). 
In New Zealand, where only true bumble bee species (but not their social 
parasites) have been introduced, spring foundress queens are encouraged to 
nest around crop fields requiring pollination by offering them underground 
nesting chambers (Donovan, 2007). The efficacy of this method of boosting 
Bombus colonies for crop pollination may be substantively reduced elsewhere 
in the world where cuckoo bumble bees are found, e.g. northern temperate 
regions, because of frequent nest usurpation by cuckoo queens.
3.2 Solitary bees
Under this heading, we include the managed solitary bees, of which 22 species 
are or have been trialled for pollination management (eight species are 
currently in use; Osterman et al., 2021), and all other wild bee species are not 
subsumed within honey bees and bumble bees. This includes ca. 20000 species 
of bee, 10% of which are not solitary but possess some degree of sociality and 
between 10% and 30% of which are cleptoparasitic (brood parasitic) on other 
wild bee species (Wcislo, 1987; Danforth et al., 2019).
Though the recent review of solitary bees by Danforth et al. (2019) is very 
informative on solitary bee pests and parasites, we still largely lack detailed 
information on their impact on host populations, with the most detailed 
knowledge derived from the foremost commercial solitary bee pollinator, 
Megachile rotundata (Pitts-Singer and Cane, 2011). Other knowledge on 
solitary bee parasites is largely derived from autecological studies of a single 
host species at a single field site (e.g. Paxton et al., 1996). Major diseases of 
solitary bees and their respective causative agents are given in Table 3.
3.2.1 Fungi: Microsporidia and chalkbrood
Microsporidia have been detected in various solitary bees (Grupe and Alisha 
Quant, 2020; Martínez-López et al., 2021), although their effects on fitness and 
mortality are poorly researched. Artificial infection of Osmia bicornis larvae 
with N. ceranae resulted in poor rates of infection, but treated larvae suffered 
apparent survival costs (Bramke et al., 2019). The Lepidopteran parasite Nosema 
thomsoni has been found in solitary bees (Ravoet et al., 2014; Schoonvaere 
et al., 2018), but we lack studies providing an in-depth analysis of its course 
of infection. Genetic examination of museum specimens of the hoary squash 
bee (Eucera pruinosa) revealed the presence of Nosema sp. in over a decade￾old pinned specimens (Vaudo et al., 2018). The North European Andrena 
scotica (synonym carantonica) harbours the Microsporidian Antonospora 
scoticae (Fries et al., 1999); there is likely a diversity of yet-to-be-discovered 
Microsporidia within other solitary bee species.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 133
A prominent fungal disease of wild bees is chalkbrood, caused by 
Ascosphaera spp. and closely related to A. apis that infects honey bees. Wild 
bees, especially those of the family Megachilid, are known to be susceptible 
to Ascosphaera spp. infection. Chalkbrood spores are ingested by a larva 
with stored brood food (the ‘bee bread’ deposited by its mother bee in an 
offspring’s natal cell). Spore germination, penetration and subsequent growth 
of the fungus inside the larval host’s body cavity cause lethal mechanical and 
enzymatic damage to the larva that becomes swollen and which, after drying 
out, resembles a ‘mummy’ of chalk-like consistency. The high pathogenicity of 
Ascosphaera spp. can lead to the death of 60% of brood. It is therefore a serious 
pathogen of commercial rearing facilities of Megachile rotundata (Richards, 
1984).
3.2.2 Other microparasites (those not visible to the naked eye) 
of wild bees
Two Crithidia spp. have been found in solitary bees: Crithidia mellificae
(reservoir host: honey bees) in Osmia cornuta and Crithidia bombi (reservoir 
host: bumble bees) in both Osmia lignaria and M. rotundata. Similar to their 
impact on their reservoir hosts, trypanosomatid infections tend to be mild and 
only subtly affect the mortality of solitary bee hosts (Figueroa et al., 2021).
Infection by Apicystis bombi has been documented in Osmia bicornis, 
considered a model solitary bee species; infected individuals, both females and 
males, show significantly reduced rates of survival, and sublethal effects might 
include compromised mating and reproductive success (Tian et al., 2018).
We know less about other solitary bee microparasites, such as bacteria, and 
therefore of their role as drivers of host decline. In some instances, for example, 
the microorganisms associated with the bee bread provisions of larvae, these 
microorganisms may play a positive and important role in protecting the 
provisions from decay and in supporting larval nutrition (Dharampal et al., 
2019; Steffan et al., 2019). Increasing awareness of the viruses of honey bees 
has, though, prompted investigation of the role of these same viruses in the 
decline of solitary bees, revealing the presence of many of them across the 
community of flower visitors (Nanetti et al., 2021). We take up this topic more 
fully below (section: disease transmission, spillover and spillback), though note 
here that definitive evidence that these ‘honey bee’ viruses are parasitic (i.e. 
reduce host fitness) is in many instances lacking.
3.2.3 Macroparasites (those visible to the naked eye)
Close investigation of a solitary bee species often reveals a rich diversity of 
symbiotic organisms, some parasitic, some potentially beneficial. A case 134 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

study of one solitary bee, Andrena scotica, revealed adults to be parasitised

mermithid nematodes and diplogasterid potentially beneficial nematodes in 
intersegmental glands whilst brood cells were parasitised by bee flies (Diptera, 
Bombyliidae), satellite flies (Diptera, Anthomyiidae), oil or blister beetles 
(Coleoptera, Meloidae) and cleptoparasitic nomad bees (Nomada marshamella; 
Hymenoptera, Anthophila) (Paxton et al., 1996). This rich assemblage of pests 
and parasites associated with this one solitary bee species, many with highly 
specialised life histories tied to just one or a few host bee species, is by no 
means unusual (Danforth et al., 2019). Though up to 40% of adults were 
parasitised by deadly conopid flies and a further 10% of brood cells (offspring) 
had been replaced by nomad cleptoparasitic bees (Paxton et al., 1996), it is 
unclear whether these parasites in any way regulated host A. scotica population 
dynamics (and therefore provision of pollination). A recent review of the 
literature (Danforth et al., 2019) comes to the same conclusion; i.e. we lack the 
data to know whether pests and parasites cause the decline of solitary bees.
3.3 Assessing impacts of disease on bumble bees and other 
wild bee species
Honey bees are eusocial, living in perennial colonies that are usually maintained 
in a beehive and managed by a beekeeper, features facilitating their inspection 
and assessment of the impact of pests and pathogens on them. The same may 
be said for managed (commercial) bumble bee colonies. For wild bees, most 
of which are solitary, with a single generation per year (Michener, 1974), and 
nesting in hidden cavities above or below ground, assessment of the impact on 
their populations of pests and diseases is all the more complicated.
One option to assess the impact on them of disease agents is to undertake 
long-term monitoring of their populations coupled with an independent 
assessment of their pests and parasites, including the use of molecular 
techniques to assay microparasites (as for honey bees: Dittes et al., 2020b). 
Multi-generation (multiannual) monitoring of wild bees through destructive 
sampling, e.g. using pan traps/bowls, though costly, is a standard technique 
for monitoring wild bee species (Westphal et al., 2008) that, from a cost-benefit 
perspective, pays its way (Breeze et al., 2021), though is not without its critics 
(Tepedino and Portman, 2021). A downside is that this approach is merely 
correlational; it can inform about changes in the population size of wild bees 
and even about the association of a change in population size with a pathogen, 
but it cannot demonstrate the cause of a decline.
A case study of Andrena scotica and its novel Microsporidian Antonospora 
scoticae reveals some of the problems (for details of the study, see Paxton et al., 
1997, supplemented by personal observation, RJP). At one nesting aggregation © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 135
at Törnbottens Stugby on Öland in South Sweden, over 85% of adults emerging 
in 1995 were infected with A. scoticae, some with over 109 spores concentrated 
in the bees’ fat bodies. Nesting females were generally uninfected or with a low 
spore count, suggesting that A. scoticae exerts a heavy fitness cost on hosts. 
Though the population of this wild bee species at Törnbottens Stugby was 
studied by RJP over 5 intensive years of fieldwork (1993–1997), formal estimate 
of its size by mark-recapture was only undertaken in 1994 and 1995, when the 
population comprised ca. 5000 females; however, by 1997 the field site was 
devoid of A. scotica (RJP, unpublished data). The Microsporidian could have 
caused the death of the Törnbottens Stugby population of Andrena scotica, 
but it is not possible to exclude other factors such as inclement weather 
during a critical phase of the life cycle, either alone or in combination with the 
Microsporidian; correct diagnosis of a decline is necessary to devise effective 
remedies to restore a population. As the Microsporidian was at the time an 
undescribed species infecting a little researched host that nests underground, 
it was difficult to conceive of control measures that could have rescued the 
population from extirpation. Moreover, the Microsporidian was seemingly host￾specific; monitoring of all wild bees by pan-trapping might not have alerted to a 
decline of A. scotica, or its decline might have been ignored as an idiosyncrasy 
of the species (which is most likely the case).
Cutting the Gordian knot of demonstrating causation requires experimental 
studies, but these are difficult with non-model species such as the vast 
majority of wild bees. In lieu of experimentation, next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) approaches might provide a high-resolution means to infer causation 
(Grozinger and Zayed, 2020); for example, Tsvetkov et al. (2021) have recently 
demonstrated that the declining North American Bombus terricola often 
harbours the parasites Nosema ceranae, Crithidia bombi, Lotmaria passim as 
well as the viruses BQCV and SBV, whereupon bees were also associated with 
an up-regulation of genes employed in defence against these parasites.
4 Disease transmission, spillover and spillback
Many routes of transmission exist for pathogens and pests of the honey bee 
that are possible because of the host’s eusocial colony organisation and 
perennial lifecycle (Schmid-Hempel, 1998). Intraspecific transmission can occur 
horizontally through within-hive interactions such as trophallaxis, grooming, 
cannibalism and direct contact augmented by the constricted space within a 
hive. Transmission between colonies occurs via hive robbing (honey bees from 
one colony removing resources from another, usually adjacent, colony), by 
bee drifting (a returning forager entering the wrong colony), at shared flower 
resources as well as by human-induced contamination of beekeeping tools, 
clothing, hive frames, honey or beeswax. Introduction of an infected queen to a 136 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

colony may result in the horizontal spread of a disease agent among other colony 
inhabitants and its vertical spread to offspring, with the route of transmission of 
considerable significance for disease epidemiology (Schmid-Hempel, 1998; 
Fries and Camazine, 2001). Though differences in apiary size (number of honey 
bee colonies per apiary) have been shown theoretically to have little impact on 
disease prevalence and epidemiology (Bartlett et al., 2019), empirical evidence 
suggests that disease prevalence increases with colony density, presumably 
because of greater opportunities for between-colony (horizontal) transmission 
(Forfert et al., 2016). Maintaining colonies in hives may itself lead to persistent 
infection within the colony (Bartlett et al., 2021).
Less is known about the transmission and epidemiology of the pests and 
parasites of wild bees. An exception is Crithidia bombi, which parasitises multiple 
bumble bee species (Ruiz-González et al., 2012) and has been demonstrated 
to be transmitted through shared use of the same flower (Durrer and Schmid￾Hempel, 1994). Even hover flies may pick up C. bombi from infected flowers 
and transport it onwards, acting as mechanical vectors (Davis et al., 2021). This 
example highlights the important role that flowers play as transmission hubs 
for a range of parasites across a diversity of pollinator (flower-visiting) insect 
species (McArt et al., 2014; Graystock et al., 2015), in which one insect deposits 
(by defecation, by regurgitation, by other forms of excretion or by mere physical 
proximity) a pathogen propagule onto a flower and from which a subsequent 
insect visitor to the same flower acquires the pathogen (Fig. 2). It also brings to 
Figure 2 Two or more bee species may sequentially visit the same flower, offering ample 
opportunity for pathogen transmission (spillover).© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 137
the fore the question of whether a transmitted pathogen leads to an infection 
in a recipient host, with the host potentially acting as a biological vector (in 
which case the host is defined as being competent), or whether the transmitted 
pathogen merely resides in or on a host without replicating, with the host acting 
either as a form of horizontal vector or as a dead-end host. These differences are 
important because they impact the parasite’s epidemiology and evolutionary 
trajectory as well as host population fitness (McMahon et al., 2018).
The global distribution of managed honey bees, even in otherwise non￾native regions (Hung et al., 2018), their increasing abundance (Osterman et al., 
2021) and the ubiquity of many of their parasites (see Section 3.1.3) have 
consequences for wild pollinator species. Pathogen spillover (interspecific 
disease transmission) from honey bees as reservoir hosts to wild bee species 
as recipient hosts has been increasingly researched because the potential 
negative effects of honey bee pathogens could undermine the already fragile 
health status of wild bee species (Fig. 3).
Spillover has been documented for several honey bee pathogens (e.g. 
Ravoet et al., 2014; Graystock et al., 2020), with increasing attention now 
being given to viral spillover. Experimental evidence using flight cages first 
demonstrated that IAPV can be transmitted from honey bees to bumble bees 
(Singh et al., 2010). Correlational evidence strongly supports the ongoing 
viral transmission of DWV and BQCV from honey bees to bumble bees in 
Figure 3 Schematic landscape describing pathogen spillover and spillback among honey 
bees and wild bee species at shared flowers, a phenomenon that may be promoted by 
agricultural practices and other global change pressures.138 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

Europe (Fürst et al., 2014; McMahon et al., 2015; Manley et al., 2019), where 
the honey bee is native, as well as in North America (Alger et al., 2019; 
Pritchard et al., 2021), where the honey bee is not native. Honey bee viruses 
have been detected in a large number of wild bee species (Nanetti et al., 
2021), suggesting that viral spillover may be a very common phenomenon. 
Though evidence for the impact of DWV on bumble bees is equivocal (cf. 
Fürst et al., 2014; Tehel et al., 2020), this and other RNA viruses have high 
adaptive potential (Holmes, 2009), thereby posing a serious threat to wild 
pollinator health. Viruses that have spilled over from a reservoir to a novel host 
may subsequently spill back to the original host with altered virulence due to 
adaptation to the novel host environment, though we currently lack evidence 
for this phenomenon.
Spillover is not solely attributable to the honey bee as a reservoir host. 
Apicystis bombi, a pathogen of bumble bees, has been increasingly found in 
managed honey bee colonies (Plischuk et al., 2011; Schulz et al., 2019), though 
the consequences of the spillover of A. bombi for pathogen epidemiology and 
recipient honey bee host fitness remain open conjectures. Pathogens may also 
spill over from managed bumble bees used for commercial pollination to wild 
bumble bees, both in North America (reservoir host Bombus impatiens: Colla 
et al., 2006) and Europe (reservoir host Bombus terrestris: Murray et al., 2013). 
In Chile and Argentina, the deployment of commercial Eurasian B. terrestris
in the past 3 decades is associated with the introduction of Eurasian variants 
of bumble bee parasites (A. bombi and C. bombi), which have likely caused 
population collapse of the native giant bumble bee of South America, Bombus 
dahlbombi (Arbetman et al., 2013; Schmid-Hempel et al., 2014).
Hopefully, it is clear from this section that pathogen spillover is a major 
determinant of the health of pollinator populations and therefore the provision 
of the ecosystem service of pollination. It needs to be seriously considered 
in the management of pollinators. Before transporting a pollinator species, 
whether native or not, to a crop requiring pollination, one should evaluate 
the risk of pathogen spillover. Encouragement of local pollinators that already 
exist in or around a crop ought to be favoured in the first instance as a more 
sustainable approach to pollination service provision.
5 Defence mechanisms of bees
Though challenged by a wide diversity of pests and pathogens, large and 
small, bees have evolved an impressive array of response mechanisms to fight 
their foes. We divide these into ‘individual immunity’, mechanisms possessed 
by each individual and which function equally in social and solitary insects, and 
‘social immunity’, describing the behavioural and physiological traits employed © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 139
by a group of two or more social bees to fight pests and pathogens (Cremer 
et al., 2007).
5.1 Individual immunity
Despite their vulnerability to infectious diseases, bees have developed 
well-functioning pathogen defence responses, comprising mechanical, 
behavioural and physiological (immune) mechanisms (Evans and Spivak, 
2010). A hard exocuticle with a waxy epithelial covering provides insects with 
a barrier against mechanical damage and limits entry points for pathogens. 
Bees employ a range of behaviours to defend themselves against their 
macroparasites. A well-studied case in point is the interaction between bumble 
bees and conopid fly parasitoids (Müller and Schmid-Hempel, 1993). A worker 
bumble bee normally spends the night in its warm hive. If a concopid fly has 
laid an egg within its abdomen, it is more likely to spend the night outdoors at 
a lower temperature, which arrests the development of the conopid egg/larva 
and may even kill it, thus extending the bumble bee’s lifespan. In a wicked 
twist of coevolution, if the conopid larva does succeed in developing inside 
its bumble bee host by eating it from the inside out, it manipulates its host to 
dig itself underground just before host death, where the conopid can pupate 
with a higher probability of survival than if the bumble bee had died in the 
open.
Although bees (like other invertebrates) do not possess an adaptive 
immune response as found in all vertebrates including ourselves, their innate 
immune mechanisms provide a wide range of physiological and other molecular 
defences that protect them from bacteria, fungi and viruses. For example, 
melanisation, encapsulation, nodulation and phagocytosis are performed by 
haemocytes in response to septic or aseptic trauma. These cellular responses 
are rapid, in contrast to the humoral mechanisms which deploy the production 
of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In detail, canonical innate immune defence 
employs pathogen recognition and signalling cascades (e.g. Toll, Imd, JAT/
STAT and JNK pathways), leading to the production of AMPs to fight against 
bacteria and fungi by altering the structure of a pathogen’s cell membrane and 
leading to its destruction. Haemocytes and AMPs are produced by the bee’s 
fat body, a factory for various immune-related compounds (Evans et al., 2006).
For fighting viruses, the best-described dimension of the honey bee’s 
innate immune system is the RNAi (RNA interference) pathway (McMenamin 
et al., 2018), which is also found in bumble bees (Barribeau et al., 2015) and 
likely all bee species. In essence, the host cell recognises and then degrades 
dsRNA (double-stranded RNA), thereafter degrading (knocking down or 
silencing) other intracellular RNA with the very same sequence, including RNA 
viruses.140 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

The honey bee’s gastrointestinal tract harbours a rich diversity of 
commensal microorganisms dominated by five major bacterial phylotypes that 
are very consistent within and between hives (Kwong and Moran, 2016). Their 
social life enables all individuals in a hive to become colonised by the same gut 
flora, which are thought to have a major beneficial impact on the health and 
fitness of the individual by maintaining an optimal gut environment, enabling 
proper nutrition, detoxification and stimulation of immune pathways (Emery 
et al., 2017) as well as defending the bee against pathogens (Forsgren et al., 
2010). Solitary bees also possess a rich gut microbiota, though it is much more 
variable in composition compared to that of social bees (Martinson et al., 2011).
5.2 Social immunity
Many behaviours of social bees are considered to be acts of collective defence 
against pathogens. Through grooming, honey bees can remove external 
parasites from either their own body or other colony members’ bodies (Pritchard, 
2016). Collective ‘balling’ of predatory wasps allows the Eastern honey bee (A. 
cerana) to kill (through heat exhaustion) yellowjackets and hornets much larger 
than an individual honey bee (Ono et al., 1995). Antimicrobial excretions can 
be passed to other honey bees together with food via trophallaxis to protect 
all colony members. This practice is a double-edged sword as pathogens that 
have escaped the effects of AMPs may also spread rapidly within the colony 
(Naug, 2008). Hygienic behaviour deploying removal of parasitised brood from 
the hive can help with parasite management, especially in reducing Varroa 
destructor invasion (Wilson-Rich et al., 2009). When faced with severe conditions 
(shortage of food and extreme temperatures), bees can cannibalise their brood 
to provide nutrition for the colony and limit the spread of pathogens (Schmickl 
and Crailsheim, 2001). Reducing pathogen dispersal among brood can also 
be achieved through social fever, when adult bees raise the temperature of the 
brood above the tolerance limit of pathogens, e.g. Ascosphaera apis (Starks 
et al., 2000). Finally, infected individuals may abandon the colony in the act 
of self-sacrifice to prevent the transmission of pathogens to other nestmates 
(Schmid-Hempel, 1998).
6 Synergies with other risk factors
The interaction between a host bee and its pests and pathogens is, in many 
instances, context-dependent, being modulated by, for example, host resource 
supply, human activities such as agricultural intensification and the associated 
use of pesticides and climate. Global change pressures may therefore drive 
altered pest and pathogen epidemiology and virulence (Proesmans et al., 
2021).© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 141
Nutrition represents an important factor that can alter the host-parasite 
relationship. Honey bee hosts with adequate resources or an intact microbiome 
are better able to tolerate viral pathogens than hosts with a depleted 
microbiome (Dosch et al., 2021). Under a scenario of agricultural intensification, 
floral scarcity in farmland threatens the provision of an adequate nutritional 
supply (Jha and Kremen, 2013), which is needed for the maintenance of a well￾functioning immune system (Smith, 2007). A mass-flowering crop that increases 
floral abundance may alleviate nutritional shortage within the agricultural 
landscape, but it may also lure in pollinators, creating a perfect opportunity 
for horizontal pathogen transmission (spillover), increasing the prevalence of 
pathogens among the community of bees (Piot et al., 2019). Alternatively, a 
superabundance of flowers may dilute pathogens, reducing transmission and 
prevalence (Graystock et al., 2020).
Pesticides impair a honey bee’s detoxification capacities and immune 
response, increasing its susceptibility to pathogen infection (di Prisco et al., 
2013). In the laboratory, synergy is seen between Nosema spp. and neonicotinoid 
insecticides used in farming, aggravating the negative effects of both agents 
on honey bees (Doublet et al., 2015). A recent, comprehensive review of 
the impacts of pesticides on bees (Siviter et al., 2021) highlights synergistic 
interactions between two or more pesticides on host health; the data on pest/
pathogen-pesticide interactions on bee health, whilst generally suggesting an 
additive or synergistic impacts, currently do not permit a definitive statement. 
This is an area that deserves great research attention across a range of managed 
and wild bee species.
Climate change, similar to agricultural intensification, may lead to the loss 
of natural habitats for wild and managed pollinators, depriving them of food 
resources and niches (Walter, 2020), with knock-on consequences for the impact 
of pests and pathogens on bees. Climate warming may allow for the expansion 
of exotic pathogens into new regions, e.g. Nosema ceranae (Natsopoulou et al., 
2015), which may be especially dangerous due to the lack of adaptation of 
naïve species to the new threat. Heat per se has an ambivalent role in pathogen 
susceptibility, on the one hand, potentially lowering host immune response 
(Laughton et al., 2017), on the other, lowering the survivorship of some 
pathogens (Zaragoza-Trello et al., 2021).
7 Prevention of diseases
Disease prevention in managed pollinators poses many challenges. One is their 
unrestricted movement from one crop to another for pollination. For example, 
the transport of ca. 2 million honey bee colonies from across the United States 
to California every February for almond pollination risks rapid transmission of 
pests and pathogens within the stock of US honey bees (Cavigli et al., 2016). 142 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
For honey bees and potentially also other bee species, drifting of workers from 
one colony to the next or the robbing by one colony’s members of another, 
diseased colony’s resources represent very efficient routes of transmission. 
Another challenge is the shared use of flowers such that pathogens can easily 
be transmitted within and between bee species. A honey bee forager visits 
hundreds to thousands of flowers every day, which creates ample opportunities 
for pathogen transmission. Since it is not possible or sensible to restrict 
foraging, disease prevention must be limited to the management or treatment 
of the hive itself. For social species such as honey bees, a third challenge is their 
size and dynamism; it is difficult to treat effectively all individuals of a colony 
that may comprise over 40000 individual worker honey bees, each replaced 
on a 3- to 6-week schedule.
Typical disease prevention for honey bees therefore aims at certain 
hygienic beekeeper standards (for one beekeeping hygiene manual, see: Tyl 
et al., 2014). In addition, low honey bee density (Forfert et al., 2016), small hive 
size and periodic brood breaks may further aid in disease control and diminish 
disease spread, though we note that maintaining a small hive size (and a small 
number of workers) likely diminishes the pollination potential of a honey 
bee colony and its likelihood of surviving the winter in northern climates like 
experienced in Canada.
Given the risk of disease spillover from managed to wild bumble bees 
(Colla et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2013), some countries or regions have imposed 
restrictions on the importation of non-native species or subspecies of Bombus, 
e.g. the United Kingdom and the Canary Isles. It is unclear whether these 
retrospective measures have prevented disease spread, though evidence from 
South America clearly points to the introduction of the non-native Bombus 
terrestris as the cause of disease spread among native bumble bees (Arbetman 
et al., 2013; Schmid-Hempel et al., 2014).
Every year, US alfalfa farmers import cocoons of M. rotundata from 
further north (Canada), where Ascosphaera spp. are absent. The widespread 
proliferation of chalkbrood in US facilities does not permit a sustainable US M. 
rotundata industry. This is not so much ‘prevention’ as ‘mitigation’ by the annual 
replacement of diseased bees.
Next, we address additional topics in disease prevention, though note that 
they largely relate to the honey bee and its diseases.
7.1 Varroa control
Given the importance of the varroa-virus nexus for honey bee health, it is 
understandable that the most commonly applied measures to control honey 
bee diseases are associated with the reduction in varroa mite infestation. Since 
V. destructor is a vector and ‘virulence amplifier’ of multiple viruses, managing © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 143
varroa infection in the hive contributes greatly to maintaining the vitality of the 
colony. Purchasing varroa-free colonies is not a long-term solution as honey 
bees will eventually acquire the mites from other hives through robbing and 
drifting.
Chemicals (miticides) are frequently used to control varroa and are often 
unavoidable as the infestation progresses and may lead to a collapse of the 
colony if untreated after 3–4 years (e.g. McMahon et al., 2016). The choice 
of chemical substances used to control mite infestation is vast, ranging from 
essential oils, propolis extracts and algal preparations to synthetic miticides 
(Box 1). Beekeeping management may also help reduce the number of varroa 
mites in a hive; examples include artificial swarming and the removal of capped 
drone brood. Varroa control is a vast topic comprehensively described by Jack 
and Ellis (2021).
Box 1. Differences between ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ 
chemicals used to control varroa mites in honey 
bee colonies
Beekeepers often resort to chemical control of Varroa destructor mites 
in their honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies because it is often difficult 
to otherwise reduce mite numbers. If not controlled, varroa mites (and 
the viruses they transmit, especially the deformed wing virus) lead to 
the collapse and death of the colony. Two classes of chemicals (‘hard’ 
and ‘soft’) are often employed in varroa control, each with their merits 
and demerits, which we bullet point here.
‘Hard’ chemicals:
• Synthetic compounds
• Examples include amitraz, coumaphos, flumethrin, tau-fluvalinate
• Advantages
º Well-established efficacy
º Convenience to use
º Low in cost
º Climate-independent efficiency
• Disadvantages
º Lead to mite resistance of a chemical
º Negative effects on bee reproduction and memory
º Accumulation in bee products, potential to enter the human 
food chain
‘Soft’ chemicals:
• Compounds found naturally in the environment, even in the hive
• Thymol, formic acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid144 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

• Advantages
º No resistance yet reported
º Impact varroa on adult bees but also in capped brood cells 
(formic acid)
º Minimal accumulation in bee products
• Disadvantages
º Limited use in temperate regions (e.g. formic acid at lower 
temperatures)
º Use limited to broodless conditions (e.g. lactic and oxalic 
acids)
º Lower and poorly quantified efficiency compared to ‘hard’ 
chemicals
See Jack and Ellis (2021) for a complete review of methods of varroa 
control in the beehive.
7.2 Viruses
The prevention of viruses in honey bees, at least those transmitted by varroa 
mites, is best achieved by controlling varroa mites (see above). For viral diseases 
of honey bee brood, namely those caused by SBV and CBPV, a break in brood 
rearing, e.g. by generating an artificial swarm or by re-queening the colony, 
is an effective means of reducing viral titres and relieving or eliminating overt 
disease symptoms (Dittes et al., 2020b). For viruses in wild bees (bumble bees 
and solitary bees) that spill over from honey bees, two plausible options are 
to decrease honey bee density (by relocating honey bee hives) and increase 
flower density, which is likely to diminish the force of infection (the probability 
that a honey bee and a wild bee visit the same flower); the latter effect has 
been inferred for protozoan parasites (Graystock et al., 2020). However, we lack 
direct tests of their effectiveness.
Given that bees, like other invertebrates, lack an adaptive (acquired) 
immune system, they cannot be ‘vaccinated’ in the way that humans can so as 
to fight viral disease. As described in Section 5, they do, though, possess an 
innate immune system, which includes the RNAi (RNA interference) pathway. By 
administering dsRNA with a specific sequence, one can efficiently knock down 
a gene’s expression or, in the case of RNA viruses, induce host cells to destroy 
viral RNA. This approach has been used with apparent success to control a 
range of pathogens in honey bees, including varroa mites and DWV (Desai 
et al., 2012; Leonard et al., 2020), though successful dsRNA administration 
requires refinement and its efficacy in the field has not yet been demonstrated 
(Paxton, 2020). RNAi does, though, offer a breakthrough in the control of 
pernicious viral diseases such as DWV.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators 145
Chemical control of bee viruses such as DWV is an additional approach 
(e.g. Tang et al., 2021), though contamination of honey (for honey bees) and 
efficacy in the field remain open questions.
7.3 Breeding
Some honey bee colonies express higher tolerance to varroa mites or viruses, 
withstanding invasion without treatment (Locke, 2016). Resistance or tolerance 
characteristics of honey bees can be maintained or enhanced by targeted 
breeding (Rinderer et al., 2010). Promoting colonies that display resistance 
against or tolerance to parasites and express social immunity traits, such as 
hygienic behaviour and grooming that are known to be genetically determined, 
is highly desirable in order to improve the intrinsic defence mechanisms of 
honey bees (Rothenbuhler, 1964; Arechavaleta-Velasco et al., 2012).
7.4 Novel methods of diagnosis and treatment
With rapid progress in molecular biology, research on bee diseases has advanced 
quickly, giving rise to novel methods of disease prevention and treatment. One 
possible option for varroa control is the use of gene drives (Faber et al., 2021). 
Promotion of genes reducing mite reproduction, survival rates or resistance to 
miticides would help immensely with effective varroa management, although 
successfully establishing gene drive in varroa population poses multiple 
obstacles, such as mite inbreeding and haplodiploidy, to be first overcome.
Extensive research into the honey bee microbiome has uncovered the 
positive effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on honey bee health (Royan, 
2019). Additionally, LAB has been reported to inhibit the growth of P. larvae, 
the causative agent of AFB (Forsgren et al., 2010); their inclusion in honey bee 
nutritional supplements may be a powerful means of enhancing honey bee 
immune defence.
Bee disease diagnosis poses another challenge; two major problems are 
the great number of asymptomatic individuals in an affected honey bee colony 
and the very circumstantial switch to overt infection that precludes proper visual 
detection of a disease. Moreover, due to the small size of individuals, bees 
often need to be sacrificed in order to identify efficiently an internal pathogen. 
To circumvent this latter problem, several means of non-lethal collection and 
detection of infectious agents from individual honey bees have been proposed, 
with notable successes in haemolymph collection (in which disease agents can 
be detected by molecular approaches) from antennae (Borsuk et al., 2017) and 
via a needle (Huang et al., 2021a).
Insight into disease pathogenesis is crucial in order to establish methods of 
treatment and prevention. A big step for honey bee viral research was the recent 146 Assessing the impact of disease on pollinators

construction of DWV tagged with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Evans et al., 
2021). Bees infected with GFP-DWV can be non-lethally screened in real time 
via camera recording. Fluorescence-marked viruses open new opportunities for 
research on this pathogen, such as DWV propagation, tissue specificity, host 
species specificity, interference with other pathogens and many others.
8 Future trends
The charm of bees and their various, often peculiar, methods of immune 
defence does not negate the fact that they suffer considerable annual losses 
from pathogens. The most important disease agents of honey bees are 
varroa mites and the viruses they transmit. Both are at high prevalence and 
act synergistically (Nazzi et al., 2012), often resulting in the death of affected 
colonies. Despite the lower number of known wild bee parasites, wild bees also 
face grave consequences from well-established pathogens and others spilling 
over from heterospecifics.
Notable progress in the detection of bee pathogens has brought to light 
the desperate need for new and effective methods for disease control, e.g. to 
treat honey bee viruses, especially DWV. Well-known disease-causing agents 
and newly emerging pests and pathogens, in interaction with climate change 
and agricultural practices, reduce pollinator survival. On a more upbeat note, 
it is important to emphasise that the initial dramatic effect of an emerging 
exotic pathogen may lessen with time as the host adapts and evolves greater 
resistance or tolerance towards the disease agent.
Human interference in honey bee colony life (disease treatment, food 
supplementation, swarm prevention and breeding focussed on production 
traits) may impede the process of natural selection and leaves the managed 
hive vulnerable to infestation and disease outbreak. Moreover, pathogens 
do not remain evolutionarily stagnant, undergoing change through mutation 
and selection, not only adapting to new hosts but also to new vectors. This 
scenario may be tempered, however, by human practices aimed at appropriate 
conservation efforts and bee management that aim at reducing pathogen 
virulence.
Together with changes in hosts and parasites, future research and 
monitoring techniques may be better able to capture data on honey bee 
diseases in real time (Rafael Braga et al., 2020). The use of NGS (genomics 
and metagenomics) marks a new standard in bee molecular research and may 
prove invaluable in elucidating the genetic diversity of bees, their parasites 
and their interactions as drivers of their diversity (Tsvetkov et al., 2021). The 
obscure pathogenesis of many honey bee diseases is now being challenged by 
means of reverse genetics (Gusachenko et al., 2020). Novel methods of disease © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

treatment arising from recent research, such as the use of LAB, RNAi and gene 
drive, promise hope for limiting pathogen spread and mitigating bee decline.
9 Where to look for further information
9.1 Honey bees
COLOSS (https://coloss.org) is a worldwide network of researchers interested in 
the health and well-being of honey bees, with numerous working groups (‘task 
forces’) addressing pressing issues in honey bee health. Membership is open to 
all. As well as organising two conferences per year, they have co-published with 
the International Bee Research Association (https://ibra.org.uk) the BeeBook, a 
compendium of (open access) chapters addressing all matters related to honey 
bees and bee research; volume II, titled Standard Methods for Apis mellifera
Pest and Pathogen Research, contains chapters on each major taxon of a honey 
bee disease-causing organism (https://coloss.org/beebook/volume-2/).
9.2 Wild bees
Schmid-Hempel’s (1998) Parasites in Social Insects is a tour de force of the 
major pests and pathogens of social insects, with much emphasis on bumble 
bees, whilst Richards’ (1984) pamphlet on managing the alfalfa leafcutter bee 
(Megachile rotundata) reviews the diseases and control measures for this 
species, the most important managed solitary bee. The literature on the pests 
and pathogens of other wild bees is scattered, though Danforth et al. (2019) 
provide an excellent overview in their book The Solitary Bees.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has a wild 
bee specialist group (WBSG) tasked with the development of best practice 
guidelines for the implementation of conservation measures for wild bees 
(https://www.iucn.org/ssc-groups/invertebrates/wild-bee/aims-wbsg). Initiated 
in 2021 and set to run till 2025, at the time of writing this chapter, WBSG’s 
website promises to provide details on how best to conserve wild bees.

Chapter 6
How neonicotinoid insecticides 
affect bees and other pollinators
D. Susan Willis Chan, University of Guelph, Canada
1 Introduction
Agricultural production faces a dilemma that pits the practice of using pesticides 
to protect crops against the need to protect the insect pollinators that provide 
crop pollination services from exposure to those pesticides (Knapp et al., 2022). 
Among pesticides (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides), insecticides pose the 
greatest, though not the only, risk to insect pollinators simply because they are 
engineered to kill insects (Sánchez-Bayo and Goka, 2014).
The pesticide regulatory system that exists in many countries is designed 
to balance protection of crops from pests with protection of pollinators from 
pesticide exposure and resulting negative impacts (see Chapter 7 of this book). 
In a farming context, the question is not if neonicotinoids are toxic to individual 
pollinators but rather if the approved agricultural uses lead to negative 
consequences for desired crop pollination services, pollinator populations, or, 
more broadly, biodiversity, which are not fully captured by the regulatory risk 
assessment process.

2 What are neonicotinoids?
The neonicotinoids are a group of broad-spectrum insecticides related to 
botanical nicotines that are used extensively across the world to control insect 
pests (Jeschke et al., 2011). They are applied on plant foliage, by injection into 
tree trunks, as soil drenches, in irrigation water (chemigation), and as coatings 
on seeds, with seed and soil applications dominating (Jeschke et al., 2011).
There are currently seven neonicotinoids commercially available as 
active ingredients in crop protection products: acetamiprid, clothianidin, 
dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam, starting 
with the introduction of imidacloprid in 1991, followed by clothianidin and 
thiamethoxam in the early 2000s (Jeschke and Nauen, 2008; Thompson 
et al., 2020). Thiacloprid, the least toxic of the neonicotinoids, was voluntarily 
removed from the US market by registrants in 2016 (Minnesota Department of 
Agriculture, 2016). Neonicotinoid insecticide products are sold under a broad 
range of brand names by many companies, and brand names may vary from 
country to country (Elbert et al., 2008). A good summary of the properties, 
producers, and brand names of neonicotinoids sold in the United States 
is provided at: https://www.mda.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/inline-files/
neonicreviewrpt2016.pdf.
All neonicotinoids are regulated where regulatory bodies exist. However, 
in most jurisdictions, including Canada, Europe, and the United States, seeds 
treated with neonicotinoids are not classified as pesticides but as ‘treated 
articles’ (like treated lumber), thereby avoiding some regulations. However, in 
one jurisdiction in Canada (i.e. the province of Ontario), this approach has been 
revisited, and neonicotinoid-coated corn and soybean seeds are considered a 
pesticide class that can only be used if the user demonstrates that pest pressure 
exceeds an established integrated pest management threshold on their land 
(Government of Ontario, 2012).
Although neonicotinoids exhibit relatively low toxicity to mammals, 
including humans, most are highly toxic to insects, including pollinators, 
causing death at concentrations less than 2 ug ai/bee (Minnesota Department 
of Agriculture, 2016). They act as insect neurotoxins by binding strongly to 
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the nervous system of insects, causing 
overfiring of neurons followed by shaking and eventual paralysis and death 
at lethal doses (Jeschke et al., 2011; https://ncceh.ca/environmental-health-in
-canada/health-agency-projects/neonicotinoid-pesticides).
Although they are not the focus of this chapter, mention should be made of 
other insecticides that share the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, such 
as flonicamid, flupyradifurone, and sulfoxaflor, and these substances have been 
referred to as neonicotinoid-like (Thompson et al., 2020). These insecticides © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

are being used as alternatives to neonicotinoids but have been described as 
‘regrettable substitutions’ (Maertens et al., 2021).
3 Why are neonicotinoids such a concern for 
pollinators?
Neonicotinoids are particularly important in any discussion of pollinators in 
an agricultural context because of their use patterns, physical properties, 
environmental persistence, and their high toxicity to bees, making them stand 
apart from other pesticides in relation to pollinators (Simon-Delso et al., 2015). 
These characteristics, including their versatility and ease of application, make 
neonicotinoids the most extensively used group of insecticides across the globe 
on a wide variety of crop plants (Jeschke et al., 2011). Their water solubility 
makes them easy for farmers to apply but also increases the risk of leakage into 
the environment through water (Schaafsma et al., 2015). Their systemic uptake 
in both wild and crop plants often results in contamination of pollen and nectar 
in those plants (Dively and Kamal, 2012; Botías et al., 2015; Traynor et al., 2021). 
Their relative stability makes them persistent in the environment, especially in 
soil where 70% of solitary bees nest (Bonmatin, et al., 2015; Willis Chan et al., 
2019). Their broad toxicity to insects may cause unintended negative impacts 
on non-target beneficial insects including bees and most other pollinators such 
as hoverflies, butterflies, and moths (reviewed in, e.g. Godfray et al., 2014; Pisa 
et al., 2014; Hladik et al., 2018).
The bee-related risks of neonicotinoids were first brought to broader 
public attention when German (Pistorius et al., 2009) and Italian (Mutinelli et al., 
2009) beekeepers observed weakening and loss of colonies during planting 
of neonicotinoid-treated maize seeds in 2008. Dust from the neonicotinoid￾coated seeds landed on and contaminated flowers in the surroundings of the 
planted maize fields (Greatti et al., 2006; Krupke et al., 2012). Pollinators that 
visit crops or live in the vicinity of crops are especially likely to be exposed to 
neonicotinoids used in agriculture, especially those pollinators that nest within 
cropping areas (Willis Chan et al., 2019; Rondeau et al., 2022). In North America, 
739 of the estimated 3500 species of bees have been found in association with 
crops, including crops such as corn or soybean that are not insect pollinated, 
59% of which visit crop flowers and 54% of which nest in the ground (Rondeau 
et al., 2022).
Most knowledge about both acute exposure and toxicity of neonicotinoids 
to insect pollinators comes from bioassays on western honey bees (Apis 
mellifera) to determine mortality endpoints (i.e. median lethal dose-LD50) and 
other effects on individual bees and from studies on honey bee colonies to 
determine colony-level impacts. However, sensitivity to neonicotinoids may 
vary greatly among pollinators, especially for small bees (Arena and Sgolastra, 168 How neonicotinoid insecticides affect bees and other pollinators

2014; Hayward et al., 2019). This discrepancy can be mitigated to some degree 
by applying a 10x safety factor applied to the honey bee LD50 (Arena and 
Sgolastra, 2014).
Extra caution is needed in interpreting the results of honey bee colony 
studies because the western honey bee is a highly unusual bee species that 
forms large, perennial colonies that enjoy a functional redundancy of labor that 
can buffer short-term impacts (Wu-Smart and Spivak, 2016). This natural buffer 
against colony or population-level impacts of neonicotinoid exposure on honey 
bees is not enjoyed by bumble bees who form smaller, annual colonies with a 
solitary queen stage or by solitary bees that do not form colonies (Franklin and 
Raine, 2019).
As such, the western honey bee is likely a useful model for evaluating direct 
acute contact or oral exposure for individual bees in laboratory conditions 
(Thompson and Pamminger, 2019), but it is probably less useful as a model for 
evaluating field exposure and population-level effects among other species of 
bees or pollinator taxa, depending on the diversity and variation in life histories 
(Boyle et al., 2018; Sgolastra et al., 2019). The variation in exposure routes 
and levels as well as toxicity and resulting risks for other bee species or insect 
pollinators is still not well understood and deserves serious attention (Pisa et al., 
2017; Lundin et al., 2015; Boyle et al., 2018).
Although acute toxicity is important, cumulative chronic exposure to 
low doses of pesticides over time can also result in mortality and is poorly 
understood and poorly represented in existing regulatory protocols (Sánchez￾Bayo and Tennekes, 2020; Pisa et al., 2017). Because of their physical-chemical 
properties, neonicotinoids pose a special risk to pollinators of chronic low￾level exposure with an associated potential for serious sublethal impacts 
on individuals and populations over time (Sánchez-Bayo and Goka, 2014; 
Willis Chan and Raine, 2021a) and carryover effects on reproduction across 
generations (Stuligross and Williams, 2020). Long-lived pollinators with annual 
social colonies such as bumble bees or bees such as squash bees that collect 
pollen only from crop plants may suffer more severe consequences (Gill and 
Raine, 2014; Willis Chan and Raine, 2021a), but such consequences have also 
been demonstrated for generalist solitary bee species (Stuligross and Williams, 
2020).
4 Environmental contamination and pollinator 
exposure
The water solubility and systemic uptake and dispersal of neonicotinoids in 
plants results in residues in plant tissue, nectar, and pollen – all major routes of 
pesticide exposure to pollinators (Kopit and Pitts-Singer, 2018; Main et al., 2018). 
The ubiquity of neonicotinoid residues in the environment is well illustrated by © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
How neonicotinoid insecticides affect bees and other pollinators 169
the detection of one or more neonicotinoids in 75% of 198 honey samples 
from around the world (Mitchell et al., 2017). Even if neonicotinoids account 
for only a small fraction of the detected pesticides in pollen collected by honey 
bees across the United States, those residues are often more hazardous than 
other detected residues (Traynor et al., 2021). In a study of pollen, nectar, and 
soil samples taken from cucurbit growing systems in Ontario, Canada, 99% of 
the calculated hazard from insecticides in soil to adult ground-nesting bees 
was from neonicotinoids, with 100% of hazard in cucurbit pollen and 40% of 
hazard in cucurbit nectar (Willis Chan et al., 2019). In other cropping systems, 
neonicotinoid residues are commonly found in soil at concentrations that can 
cause mortality in small ground-nesting bees (Willis Chan et al., 2019).
Estimates suggest that when seeds are coated with neonicotinoids, only 
2–20% of the neonicotinoids are taken up by the crop (Sur and Stork, 2003; Alford 
and Krupke, 2017), leaving the remaining residues in the soil where they can be 
further distributed in the environment. The water solubility of neonicotinoids 
means they may leak from soil via runoff or leaching into water systems and 
potentially expose the aqueous life stages of some pollinators (Hallman et al., 
2014; Hladik et al., 2018). Within cropping systems, neonicotinoid residues can 
persist in the soil from season to season at levels that represent a high acute 
and chronic risk to bees that nest in the ground in some scenarios (Goulson, 
2013; Willis Chan et al., 2019). Soils in orchards and other perennial crops can 
be particularly polluted because pesticide use is intensive and no tillage or 
crop rotation occurs in those contexts (Tang and Maggi, 2021).
Honey bees and their colonies encounter a mixture of pesticides in 
agricultural landscapes For example, 120 pesticide residues including 
herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides were detected in thousands of pollen 
samples collected by honey bees over seven years in the United States with 
only 18% of pollen samples being pesticide free (Traynor et al., 2021). Similar 
evidence is emerging for other pollinators such as wild bees (David et al., 2016; 
Hladik et al., 2016; Willis Chan et al., 2019) or butterflies (Olaya-Arenas and 
Kaplan, 2019). This raises concerns about the potential for synergism between 
neonicotinoids and their metabolites and other pesticides and chemicals. 
For example, neonicotinoids are often applied alongside fungicides in seed 
treatments with possible potentiation of neonicotinoids with some fungicides 
(e.g. Tsvetkov et al., 2017; Carnesecchi et al., 2019; Iverson et al., 2019).
Occurrence of neonicotinoids in the environment is the outcome of 
grower use practices and patterns, with pollinator exposure to neonicotinoids 
and other pesticides the result of the intersection of grower use and pollinator 
activity in space and time (Sponsler et al., 2019). This intersection is determined 
by life-history traits of the pollinators with expected variation among and within 
pollinators groups (reviewed for solitary bees: Kopit and Pitts-Singer, 2018; 
Sgolastra et al., 2019; bumble bees: Gradish et al., 2018; butterflies: Braak 170 How neonicotinoid insecticides affect bees and other pollinators
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
et al., 2018; non-target terrestrial arthropods: Main et al., 2018). For example, 
for pollinator species that nest or overwinter in soil, that intersection includes 
not only crop nectar and pollen available during the growing season but also 
residues present in soil during all seasons (Willis Chan et al., 2019; Rondeau 
et al., 2022).
In summary, to accurately understand the risk and potential impact of 
neonicotinoids, the acute toxicity of each neonicotinoid as well as the exposure 
time (acute or chronic), exposure route (oral or contact), and the synergistic 
toxicity of co-exposures to neonicotinoids and other pesticides must be 
considered (Sánchez-Bayo and Goka, 2014).
5 Toxicity and effects across pollinator taxa and 
contexts
Pollinators can be exposed to neonicotinoids topically through contact with 
residues on their cuticle or through their breathing spiracles, and/or they can 
be exposed orally through ingestion of residues in the food they consume. 
Toxicity of neonicotinoids is generally greater for oral exposure versus topical 
(contact) exposure (Alkassab and Kirchner, 2017).
5.1 Topical exposure
Topical neonicotinoid exposure routes for pollinators include overspray, dust, 
contaminated air breathed in through spiracles, soil and plant material, and 
also water for aquatic life stages (e.g. some fly larvae: Morrissey et al., 2015; 
Hladik et al., 2018). Since pollinators are engaged in the transfer of pollen from 
anthers to stigmas (see Chapter 1 of this book), all pollinators can be topically 
exposed to neonicotinoid residues in pollen (Willis Chan et al., 2019). Pollinators 
can also be topically exposed to pesticide residues as they collect other 
resources (nectar, resins), find mates, collect nesting materials, excavate soil to 
make ground nests, and care for their offspring – with variability in importance 
among routes of exposure related to pollinator life history traits (Sgolastra 
et al., 2019). The relative importance of these different routes of exposure is not 
well understood among species and groups of pollinators despite attempts to 
quantify this among bees for their adult and larval life stages (e.g. Boyle et al., 
2018; Willis Chan et al., 2019).
5.2 Oral exposure
Pollinators can be orally exposed to neonicotinoids primarily through 
consumption of pollen and nectar at both adult and larval stages, although 
exposure can also occur for some pollinators through water, honey dew, plant © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
How neonicotinoid insecticides affect bees and other pollinators 171
materials, resins, or prey. For example, plant material, including resins, is an 
especially relevant oral exposure route for butterfly larvae (Braak et al., 2018) 
and leafcutter and resin bees (Kopit and Pitts-Singer, 2018). Furthermore, 
predatory pollinator species such as phidophagous hover fly larvae (Dunn 
et al., 2020) may be exposed through their prey, which are routinely controlled 
in crops by neonicotinoids.
6 Sublethal effects on bees and interactions among 
multiple stressors
Neonicotinoids can also have sublethal effects below the lethal dose, which 
impair the health of pollinators as individuals or populations but may not 
cause mortality outright (Alkassab and Kirchner, 2017). The sublethal effects 
of neonicotinoids are increasingly well understood for bees, with most studies 
conducted on honey bees and to a lesser extent on bumble bees, stingless 
bees, and solitary bees (Table 1).
Effects of exposure to neonicotinoids on bees occur at the cellular or 
subcellular level with knock-on effects at individual, colony, and population 
levels (Godfray et al., 2014, 2015; Lundin et al., 2015; Alkassab and Kirchner, 
2017), and these effects can be detected across generations (Stuligross 
and Williams, 2020). These include negative impacts on gene expression, 
learning, locomotion, memory, foraging, hygienic behavior, queen viability, 
reproduction, growth, nest initiation, colony establishment, population stability, 
and crop pollination services (Decourtye and Devillers, 2010; Godfray et al., 
2014, 2015; Stanley et al., 2015a,b; Rundlöf et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2015; 
Alkassab and Kirchner, 2017; Baron et al., 2017; Tesovnik et al., 2017; Tison 
et al., 2017; Jacob et al., 2019a,b; Willis Chan and Raine, 2021a; Stuligross 
and Williams, 2020). A meta-analysis of sublethal effects on non-Apis bees 
from ‘field-realistic’ neonic exposure is provided by Siviter and colleagues 
(2021).
6.1 Interactions among multiple stressors
Clearly, the pollinator species, the exposure route (topical or oral), the exposure 
concentration (lethal or sublethal), the length of exposure (acute or chronic), 
and whether synergism is occurring with other pesticides all contribute to the 
severity of effects of neonicotinoids to pollinators (Decourtye and Devillers, 
2010; Arena and Sgolastra, 2014; Sánchez-Bayo and Goka, 2014; Tsvetkov 
et al., 2017; Sgolastra et al., 2019). However, effects may be further complicated 
by the additive or synergistic effects of neonicotinoids on other stressors such 
as nutritional stress or parasite and disease pressure that also impair pollinator 
health (e.g. meta-analysis by Siviter et al., 2021 and Tosi et al., 2022).172 How neonicotinoid insecticides affect bees and other pollinators

How neonicotinoid insecticides affect bees and other pollinators 173
7 Case studies illustrating consequences for pollinator 
populations and pollination
7.1 Consequences for bumble bees, solitary Osmia sp. and 
honey bees in field conditions
The effects on bees of direct exposure to neonicotinoids do not necessarily 
reflect exposure in the field where exposure may be via interaction with a 
treated crop. To test the effect of indirect exposure via a crop, a study that 
examined the effect of neonicotinoid exposure on bumble bees (Bombus 
terrestris), solitary bees (Osmia bicornis), and honey bee colonies (A. mellifera) 
under field-realistic conditions was carried out (Rundlöf et al., 2015). The study 
used eight pairs of replicated study sites in matched landscapes in which bees 
were either exposed to oilseed rape crops that were treated or untreated with 
clothianidin as seed coatings. In landscapes where oilseed rape was grown 
from neonicotinoid-treated seed, the overall density of wild bees visiting the 
crop was lower even when crop flowering density was considered. Results also 
showed a clear reduction in colony growth and reproduction for bumble bees 
and reduced nesting activity by solitary bees. However, no effects were seen 
on the colony strength of honey bees. This suggests that crops grown from 
clothianidin-treated seed have a negative impact on wild bees and that honey 
bees are not necessarily a reliable model for testing population-level effects on 
wild bees in field conditions.
7.2 Effect of exposure to soil-applied imidacloprid on solitary 
ground-nesting squash bees in semi-field conditions
The ground-nesting solitary hoary squash bee (Eucera pruinosa) is an important 
pollinator of pumpkins and squash (Cucurbita species) in North America. The 
hoary squash bee is unusual because it is a specialist on wild and cultivated 
Cucurbita, and across most of its range, its sole source of pollen is from 
pumpkin and squash crops (López-Uribe et al., 2016). As such, it is particularly 
vulnerable to exposure to pesticides used on those crops. In Canada, over a 
3-year period, the effects of exposure to a soil-applied imidacloprid or a seed￾applied thiamethoxam on hoary squash bee populations were evaluated (Willis 
Chan and Raine, 2021b). Measures of nest initiation, pollen harvesting, and 
offspring production by the hoary squash bee were evaluated in field-realistic 
conditions in large enclosures. In the enclosures, the bees were exposed to 
squash plants that had been treated with neonicotinoids 8 weeks prior to bee 
activity on the flowers. Over 3 generations, bees exposed to plants treated 
with imidacloprid harvested much less pollen, initiated 86% fewer nests, and 
produced 89% fewer offspring than did unexposed bees. Bees exposed to 174 How neonicotinoid insecticides affect bees and other pollinators

plants grown from seed treated with thiamethoxam showed no difference from 
unexposed bees in pollen harvesting, nest initiation, and offspring production.
7.3 Effect of oral exposure to thiamethoxam on establishment 
of bumble bee nests
Founding queens of bumble bee colonies represent a vulnerable yet critical 
stage of the bumble bee lifecycle. In the spring, founder queens emerge 
from overwintering sites, locate a suitable nesting site, and begin to initiate a 
colony by creating brood cells within the nest, foraging for nectar and pollen, 
and laying eggs. The success of the subsequent colony and the bumble bee 
population in a location depends upon the founding queen’s ability to initiate 
a nest and lay eggs. A study done in the UK with the bumble bee Bombus 
terrestris exposed founding queens to a field-relevant dose of the neonicotinoid 
thiamethoxam while exposing the queens to two natural stressors: the parasite 
Crithidia bombi and varying lengths of hibernation (Baron et al., 2017). For 
queens treated with thiamethoxam, the proportion of founding queens that 
laid eggs was reduced by 26%. When this reduction in egg laying was modeled 
mathematically, it revealed a dramatic increase in the likelihood of population 
extinction for founding queens exposed to thiamethoxam.
7.4 Intergenerational reproduction effects of soil-applied 
imidacloprid on the above-ground cavity-nesting solitary 
bee Osmia lignaria
Although the direct impacts of exposure to neonicotinoids on pollinators are 
of great importance, the carryover effects from one generation to another, 
especially for solitary bees, can have implications for long-term population 
persistence.
In a study over 2 years on the solitary orchard bee, Osmia lignaria, 
researchers evaluated the effects of exposure to the neonicotinoid 
imidacloprid on individual vital rates and the carryover effects on population 
growth in subsequent generations (Stuligross and Williams, 2020). In the study, 
populations of orchard bees were either exposed by foraging on imidacloprid￾treated wildflowers in a flight cage or not exposed in year one. In year 2, bees 
exposed in year 1 were either exposed to imidacloprid again or not exposed, 
and unexposed bees were either unexposed again or exposed to imidacloprid. 
Bees directly exposed produced 30% fewer offspring and the following 
unexposed generation produced 20% fewer offspring than bees that had never 
been exposed directly or in a previous generation. Bees exposed in both years 
produced 44% fewer offspring than unexposed bees, and the proportion of 
female offspring they produced was reduced.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

7.5 Consequences for bumble bees on apple pollination
Providing pollination services to crops is often cited as the most important 
role that pollinators play in agriculture. In a study in the UK, researchers 
demonstrated that bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) exposed to the 
neonicotinoid thiamethoxam visited apple flowers at a lower rate and collected 
pollen less often than unexposed bees (Stanley et al., 2015b). The resulting 
apples contained fewer seeds indicating that pollination services were impaired 
by exposure to thiamethoxam and that exposure of individuals led to a colony￾level effect on pollination services.
8 Conclusion
Neonicotinoids clearly have the potential to pose health risks to agricultural 
pollinators, including both managed and wild populations, based on a range 
of laboratory, semi-field, and field studies. As such, a re-evaluation of their use 
in agriculture is warranted, especially because they are so widely used on a 
broad range of crops. Although neonicotinoids are highly regulated, because 
of differences in exposure, sensitivity, and life history between the western 
honey bee and other important bee and non-bee pollinators, the use of honey 
bees as the sole insect model to represent other pollinators in risk assessments 
of neonicotinoids may be a flawed approach that needs improvement. 
Although neonicotinoids are the focus of this chapter, other closely related 
systemic insecticides such as flonicamid, flupyradifurone, and sulfoxaflor may 
also pose risks, and their use should be guided by the lessons learned from 
neonicotinoids.
9 Where to look for further information
Future research is needed to more fully understand the consequences of 
long-term exposure to neonicotinoids and other pesticides on a broader 
range of pollinator taxa. The importance of exposure via soil needs to be more 
fully documented for ground-nesting bees, with particular emphasis on the 
mechanism of translocation of residues from soil to the bees. Also needed is 
evidence supporting specific ways of mitigating or reducing exposure to all 
systemic pesticides for all pollinator groups. For more information about this 
topic, the European Academies Science Advisory Council's (EASAC) 2015 
Report on ecosystem services, agriculture and neonicotinoids (https://easac.eu
/publications/details/ecosystem-services-agriculture-and-neonicotinoids/) is 
an excellent resource. For more information about how to protect pollinators in 
specific crops see Pollinator Partnership Canada's Agricultural Guides (https://

1 Introduction
In agriculture, pesticides are widely used to control hazardous pests, diseases, 
and weeds which would otherwise affect the health of crops and agricultural 
productivity (Popp et al., 2013). The need to control these factors varies across 
crops and regions, depending on pest pressure, crop variety and its tolerance 
to stress, and local agronomic and climatic conditions. However, where no or 
insufficient control is provided, yield losses of up to more than 80% may be 
the consequence (Oerke, 2006). On the other hand, pesticides are designed 
to control target populations of organisms which are damaging crops (e.g. 
insect pests, fungi, weeds) by killing individuals of these organisms or acting 
on their development or presence in a field. Due to these inherent properties, 
pesticides may have undesired side effects to the environment if they are not 
applied with the necessary caution.
The selectivity of pesticides to a group of target organisms is variable 
and depends on a number of factors such as mode of action, mechanisms of

uptake, metabolization, and administration. The inclusion of a large number of 
screening tests in the product development has overall improved the selectivity 
of pesticides over time. However, only very few pesticides are so selective 
that they inherently would only affect pest species and would not have the 
potential to harm non-target species taxonomically related to pests. Therefore, 
environmental safety requirements, along with regulatory systems to enforce 
them, have been established for the registration of pesticides to ensure that the 
use of all pesticide products in the field will not cause unacceptable effects to 
the environment. For this purpose, the use and commercialization of pesticides 
is subject to the most stringent regulatory systems which are globally in place 
for chemicals, which are defining principles and requirements of environmental 
risk assessment and management, and directions for the implementation of 
environmental risk assessment and management. One of the most debated 
and most intensively researched examples of non-target organisms and their 
protection from unwanted pesticide side effects in this regulatory context are 
bees and other pollinators.
The reasons for this are diverse: first, bees are important pollinators and, 
as an organism group exhibiting mutually beneficial trophic interactions 
with crops, an essential production factor in agriculture (e.g. IPBES, 2016). 
Therefore, growers have a genuine interest in having them protected from 
possible pesticide side effects. Second, honey bees are managed as livestock, 
especially in regions like Europe and North America (e.g. Pirk et al., 2017), and 
for managed colonies, there is a beekeeper attending them who is concerned 
about their health and safety, which fostered the specific attention of pesticide 
safety to bees earlier than for many other organisms of the environment. Finally, 
honey bees can be readily bred and managed, and there is long-standing 
experience with handling their colonies (van Engelsdorp and Meixner, 2010). 
As such, they could be used for tests under semi-natural conditions from the 
beginning of ecotoxicological research, without having to upfront develop 
techniques for breeding and handling.
These specific features ensure a special position of the honey bee in risk 
assessment systems. Whereas most other standard testing organisms in risk 
assessment have from the beginning been established as surrogate species, 
representing a more or less broad spectrum of other species that could not be 
directly tested, the honey bee was, at least initially, considered as a standalone 
species, representing in the first place itself rather than other taxa. Although 
in the meantime honey bees are debated as surrogate organisms for other 
pollinators, especially solitary bees and bumblebees (e.g. European Food 
Safety Authority, 2013a, United States Environmental Protection Agency et al., 
2014), this unique feature still involves specificities in the risk assessment (e.g. 
the Hazard Quotient), which will be discussed in more detail in subsequent 
sections.Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.

2 History of bee testing and risk assessment
The first steps to investigate the side effects of pesticides on bees started early 
in the history of ecotoxicology. The historic development of bee testing and risk 
assessment in Germany and in the European Union, which is well-documented, 
serves as a case study, yet the prerequisites and processes which governed 
these developments were basically comparable in other countries.
When the use of pesticides became prevalent in agriculture in the early 
twentieth century, many of the products used to control insect pests contained 
highly toxic substances like arsenic or lead. Their application in flowering crops 
led in some cases to bee kills, and subsequently to complaints from beekeepers, 
which prompted authorities to develop solutions for this issue. As an example, in 
Germany, a Testing Center for Pesticides (‘Prüfstelle für Pflanzenschutzmittel’) at 
the Imperial Institution for Biology (Biologische Reichsanstalt) was established 
in 1920, which dealt with the assessment of pesticide side effects to bees, 
initially on the basis of simple oral, and later also contact acute tests. At this 
time, a specific registration process for pesticides with integral environmental 
safety assessment was not in place and thus bee testing was not mandatory. 
The Testing Center issued, based on their findings, recommendations for risk 
mitigation measures to protect bees (Brasse, 2007).
Later, testing approaches became more sophisticated, and tent tests with 
bee colonies were used in safety assessments (e.g. Finkenbrink, 1940). The 
1950s saw an increasing need to further optimize the approaches to protect 
bees from potential pesticide side effects, and, in this context, to generate 
accurate figures describing intrinsic bee toxicity. In 1956, the International 
Commission on Bee Botany organized a meeting in Bern (Switzerland) on the 
theme of the protection of bees from pesticide effects (Pettinga, 1980), which 
triggered further work and follow-up consultations and congresses by various 
organizations to further elaborate approaches for testing solutions. At the 
same time, approaches to systematically compile methods to analyze pesticide 
residues in dead bees were initiated (Stute, 1956).
In the 1970s, the progressive development of testing methods triggered 
the need for method harmonization between European countries and research 
organizations. The Symposium on the Harmonization of Methods for Testing the 
Toxicity of Pesticides to Bees took place in 1980 in Wageningen (The Netherlands) 
(Pettinga, 1980, Stevenson, 1980). Further international consultations on the topic 
followed, and a few years later, Oomen (1986) published a sequential scheme 
for evaluating the hazard of pesticides to bees. On the basis of the fundamentals 
elaborated during these exchanges, the European and Mediterranean Plant 
Protection Organization issued harmonized testing guidelines (EPPO, 1992) and 
a risk evaluation scheme (EPPO, 1993) for honey bees in the early 1990s. The 
EPPO Guidelines and Schemes have been subject to revisions since that time, 186 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
reflecting scientific knowledge and experience gained from their use. The latest 
version was issued in 2010 (EPPO, 2010a,b). The EPPO Risk Assessment Scheme 
was officially withdrawn in 2018 (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection 
Organization, 2021) but is effectively still in use in the European Union.
In 2012, the European Food Safety Authority took over the review of risk 
assessment guidance for bees and proposed a new Guidance Document 
(EFSA, 2013a). The document expands the risk assessment to bumble bees and 
solitary bees but so far could not be fully implemented, among other reasons 
because of the lack of complete testing schemes for these groups and the lack 
of methods to experimentally measure the protection goals proposed in the 
document. A revised version has been prepared by EFSA (EFSA, 2019) and is 
up for public commenting (EFSA, 2019).
3 Testing pesticide effects to pollinators
In order to evaluate the risk of a pesticide to pollinators, one of the essential 
steps is determining the intrinsic toxicity of the pesticide to the pollinator. In 
regulatory ecotoxicology, this is done by means of an elaborate system of 
testing methods and approaches, which are described in the following.
3.1 Test species
Assessing the effects of chemicals on non-target species populations and 
communities is not a simple task. Evaluating effects on the environment, 
biodiversity and ecosystems must concede that testing every species in any type 
of ecosystem is impossible. Thus, risk assessments, and particularly regulatory 
risk assessments that support regulatory decision making, typically rely on a 
set of standardized and reliable data aimed at providing a representative 
indication of a chemical’s potential effects on the environment, with a high level 
of certainty.
In this context, standardized ecotoxicity testing has seen an increased 
development in the last decades, offering a range of testing methods on 
standard species that provide a sensitive assessment of the intrinsic toxicity of 
chemicals, in a reproducible and robust way (OECD, 2021a).
For pollinators, most regulatory studies are performed on the honey bee, 
Apis mellifera. The choice of the honey bee as a standard or surrogate species 
in the risk assessment of chemicals has been extensively discussed (e.g. Boyle 
et al., 2018, Hinarejos et al., 2018) and is based on several rationales as follows:
• Historically, honeybees appear to be the first non-target insect species 
farmers and beekeepers were adamant to protect in a crop, because of its 
role in pollination and the provision of hive products such as honey.Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators 187
• Non-intentional effects of pesticides on honeybees have hence been 
studied since the early twentieth century (e.g. Brasse, 2007, Palmer-Jones, 
1958, Everts, 1990) even before testing methods on non-target arthropods 
used in biocontrol were developed (Barrett et al., 1994).
• Testing methods could be rapidly developed, as honeybees are easy 
to raise and maintain under human management, and well suitable for 
the development of accurate, reproducible, and measurable exposure 
dosing, such as controlled oral administration and topical application of a 
test item in the laboratory.
• Honey bee behavior enabled testing under confined laboratory conditions, 
in tunnels in the field, and in the open field, allowing testing of effects 
in a broad range of scenarios and testing tiers from the laboratory at an 
individual level to the field scale at the colony level.
• Individual bees can learn to respond to a stimulus and thus testing can 
involve behavioral effects such as foraging behavior (OECD, 2021c, 
Decourtye et al., 2005) or learning capacity.
• The biology of the honey bee is well described which allows for an easy 
interpretation of testing results.
• Ecotoxicity data indicate that the honey bee is usually an inherently 
sensitive species to pesticides, and thus a good indicator of pesticide 
intrinsic toxicity. Exceptions exist that usually relate to differences in 
body weight and/or differences in the metabolic pathways that degrade 
pesticides (Arena and Sgolastra, 2014, Pamminger, 2021).
Differences in biology and behavior between bee species may greatly 
influence their factual sensitivities to pesticides under field conditions, which 
has stimulated the development of new testing methods on bee species other 
than the honey bee. To date, acute oral and contact toxicity testing guidelines 
have been developed for bumblebees Bombus terrestris (OECD, 2017b,c). 
Method development is ongoing for a chronic bumblebee laboratory test 
(Exeler et al., 2020), an acute contact (Roessink et al., 2018) and oral (Hodapp 
and Kimmel, 2018, Roessink et al., 2018, 2020) laboratory test with the mason 
bee (Osmia spp.), a larval laboratory test with Osmia cornuta (Exeler and 
Quambusch, 2020), and an acute laboratory contact test (Nocelli et al., 2020) 
as well as a larval laboratory test (Rosa-Fontana et al., 2020) with stingless bees 
(Meliponini). Moreover, higher-tier testing methods are under development 
for bumble bees and solitary bees (Cabrera et al., 2015, Knaebe et al., 2018, 
Franke et al., 2020).
Overall, the robustness of a risk assessment to pollinators relies on the 
possibility to assess whether the effects that were observed in laboratory 
studies for a tested species will express under higher-tier testing conditions 
reproducing the conditions of exposure expected after the intended use, 188 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
addressing the uncertainties identified in lower-tier studies, and enabling 
extrapolation to other (untested) species. While ideally complete testing 
schemes for each species could reduce uncertainties in the risk assessment 
and adapt the testing requirements to the most representative pollinator of a 
cultivated crop, alternative ways to perform the risk assessment are necessary in 
real life, since testing each possibly exposed species is impossible in practice. 
A possible way forward is to design risk assessment scenarios according to 
the concept of ‘focal species’, based on the model developed for example in 
the risk assessment performed for birds and mammals (European Food Safety 
Authority, 2009). In such systems, effect testing is performed through methods 
developed on two standard species of different bird groups. The risks to the 
bird species expected to use a specific crop as a habitat and thus being the most 
likely to be exposed are evaluated through exposure scenario and biological 
traits defined for those species, to account for differences in traits, diet, and 
behavior. The possibilities to develop such a system for pollinators were 
discussed in a dedicated workshop, and recommendations were published by 
Boyle et al. (2018).
3.2 Testing methodologies and designs
Ecotoxicological tests with bees expose bees or bee colonies to a pesticide in 
a standardized and defined way and include regular observations to evaluate 
whether effects are induced and which effect the tested substance may have on 
the test organisms. All testing types include an untreated control group, one or 
several treatment groups which mostly evaluate different test concentrations, 
and a toxic standard group with a substance that causes known, defined, 
and reproducible effects to the test organisms. Only in open field tests, a 
toxic standard is usually not applied to avoid the deliberate release of toxic 
concentrations of pesticides into the environment (see e.g. Lewis et al., 2001, 
2009). Mostly, tests are conducted in a replicated design (i.e. each treatment 
group is run in a number of replicates) to allow for statistical evaluation.
For all tests, there are defined parameters to be evaluated, which may be 
affected by the test substance. Typical parameters measured in laboratory tests 
are mortality, food uptake, and behavior. In more complex tests involving entire 
honey bee colonies, other parameters such as flight and foraging activity, colony 
strength, hive weight, nectar and pollen storage, breeding activity and hatching 
success, or even overwintering success can additionally be tested. The more 
complex a test design is, the more parameters can generally be assessed. The 
values of these parameters measured for the test substance are subsequently 
evaluated by comparison with the data from the control and the toxic standard 
groups. From those measured parameters and their comparative evaluation, a 
study endpoint is derived (for a more detailed definition, see e.g. United States Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators 189
Environmental Protection Agency, 2003). Each test type has a defined endpoint, 
e.g. an LD50 (concentration that is lethal for 50% of the test organisms), a 
Non-Observable Effect Concentration (NOEC) (concentration that causes 
no observable effects), an NOED (individual dose that causes no observable 
effects), or an NOER (application rate that causes no observable effects).
Most risk evaluation systems are based on studies of different complexity. 
Studies of lower complexity are characterized by a simplified design, whereas 
the more complex studies reflect more realistic exposure scenarios. These 
different levels of complexity are referred to as study ‘tiers’. Lower-tier studies 
are mostly conducted in the laboratory under artificial exposure conditions, 
and, in the case of honeybees, usually with individual worker bees. By their 
simplistic design, they exclude as far as possible factors that may influence 
exposure and therefore generate variability in the results. These studies focus 
on the test organism and its intrinsic biological traits, and on the test substance, 
and are typically well standardized. Lower-tier studies have the advantage that 
they can usually be conducted relatively easily and frequently without great 
efforts and that their interpretation is accordingly straightforward.
Higher-tier studies, in contrast, are typically exposing bees under more 
realistic conditions in the semi-field or field, in the case of honeybees with entire 
colonies. They assess the effects of a substance in a field-relevant scenario, 
considering additional relevant factors other than the test organism and the 
substance. The bees are typically exposed to the test substance through 
matrices that are exposed to the treatment, such as flowers, nectar, or pollen. 
However, in certain study types, e.g. colony feeding studies, artificial standard 
exposure designs can be employed in order to achieve controlled exposure 
conditions (e.g. Oomen et al. 1992).
In honey bee risk assessment, the following study tiers are distinguished 
(United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2021a):
1 Tier 1: laboratory testing (individual bees tested, simplistic design, 
artificial exposure).
2 Tier 2: cage studies, semi-field and colony feeding studies (bee colonies 
tested in a compartment (tunnel/tent) and exposed to a realistically 
treated crop, or free-flying colonies exposed to an artificially spiked 
diet).
3 Tier 3: field testing (free-flying bee colonies exposed to realistically 
treated crops in a controlled design).
4 Tier 4: post-registration field monitoring studies, involving observations 
under practical use conditions without a controlled design.
The progression across the tiers from 1 to 3 in a risk assessment is illustrated 
in Fig. 1.190 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
A broad spectrum of different study types has been developed, which 
are testing different endpoints at different testing tiers. Some important study 
types for honey bee and bumblebee tests are listed in Table 1.
3.3 Testing guidelines and risk assessment guidance 
documents
In order to generate test results that are comparable to each other and with 
benchmarks relevant to the safety assessment, ecotoxicological tests have to 
be conducted in a standardized way, according to defined testing guidelines. A 
testing guideline is a detailed, officially approved method description for a test 
procedure. The degree of detail with which a guideline stipulates test design 
and procedures depends on type and complexity of the test; the simpler 
the test setup (e.g. laboratory tests), the more detailed and prescriptive the 
guideline can be, whereas in more complex setups (e.g. field testing), more 
flexibility is needed to adjust the design for specificities of the crop, the tested 
product, and prevailing environmental conditions.
The studies to be used for the pesticide safety assessment usually have 
to follow an officially recognized guideline which sets out the test design 
and procedure, but also the prerequisites under which a test and its results 
can be considered valid (so-called Validity Criteria). Guidelines are issued 
or approved by international organizations, for example, the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) or the European and 
Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO), or authorities (e.g. United 
States Environmental Protection Agency). Some important testing guidelines

are compiled in Table 1. Besides internationally accepted testing guidelines, 
there are also some specific guidelines on a national level in certain countries 
(e.g. the Foliar Residues Test according to OCSPP 850.3030 (USA, Brazil, South 
Korea) or the semi-field test according to CEB 230 (France)).
3.4 Test method development and validation
For a test design to be useful in risk assessment, it must be capable of 
yielding reproducible and consistent results. This means that wherever and by 
whomever a study of a certain type with given parameters like test substance 
and test concentrations is conducted, it must be assured that the results are 
always the same or at least do not exceed a defined range of variation (e.g. a 
certain maximum control mortality). This sounds trivial but is not. Experience has 
shown that it is relatively straightforward for a testing laboratory to implement 
and successfully apply a new testing design; however, using a new method in a 
way that ensures results consistent with those of other testing facilities is much 
more difficult, and in most cases, it has taken years for experienced laboratories 
to implement new methods according to consistent standards. This is because 
even small details in the test design (e.g. air humidity, light regimen, food 
composition, etc.), the relevance of which may not be initially evident, can have 
a substantial influence on the results of a study. In order to address this, new

Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators 195
testing guidelines normally go through a validation process called ring testing 
(OECD, 2005) before they can be finalized and officially endorsed. Ring testing 
is a stepwise process where different testing facilities apply a new test design 
in a coordinated way in parallel and compare the results. When the results 
between the different laboratories are not consistent, parameters are identified 
which may be causing this variability, and eliminated to harmonize the design. 
This is done iteratively until consistently reproducible results can be produced 
by all participating testing units. Considering the importance of validation for 
the generation of significant results, risk assessment should always be based on 
validated test methods.
3.5 Good Laboratory Practice compliance ensuring quality 
standards for regulatory studies
To ensure that safety studies are conducted according to globally comparable 
quality standards and to ascertain that study procedures and study results are 
clearly traceable and reproducible, the principles of Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) have been developed and established as a framework for conducting 
and reporting studies. The principles of GLP set out clear regulations for 
responsibilities and documentation in the course of study conduction and 
evaluation. Adherence to the GLP regulation prevents unreproducible study 
Figure 7 Field test with honey bees in oilseed rape according to EPPO 170.196 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
results and precludes data falsification and fraud. The principles of GLP were 
established in the 1970s and adopted in many countries around the world 
in the 1980s and 1990s under the auspices of OECD (OECD, 1998c, 2021d). 
Pesticide studies for regulatory purposes must be conducted under GLP in 
most countries.
4 Ecotoxicological risk assessment for pollinators
Once the intrinsic toxicity of a pesticide to a pollinator has been determined, 
the risk posed to the pollinator by the use of the product can be determined 
by respective risk assessment approaches. One of the basic features of these 
risk assessment approaches is that it compares effect data and exposure data 
(see e.g. European Food Safety Authority, 2012). This step is essential, since not 
only the intrinsic toxicity of a substance but also the exposure to the substance 
drive the risk. In the risk assessment, both parameters are brought together and 
integrated.
4.1 Fundamental principles of risk assessment
In the registration process for pesticides, studies that have been conducted 
to assess the toxicity of a product are followed by procedures that assess 
the product for its risk to pollinators. Risk assessment is based on some 
fundamental principles and follows respective rules and procedures which 
have been stipulated by the legislator. Principles, details, and backgrounds of 
the most important risk assessment approaches are outlined in the following 
sections.
4.1.1 Protection goals
Protection goals are the benchmarks used to interpret the outcome of a risk 
assessment for regulatory decision-making purposes.
In the pesticide regulatory process of the European Union (European 
Parliament and Council of the European Union 2009, Article 4 (3)(e)), uniform 
principles for the placing of pesticides on the market are defined. They stipulate 
that ‘a pesticide must not have unacceptable effects on the environment, and 
no impact on biodiversity and ecosystems’. The compliance of a pesticide to 
these protection goals is verified by the risk assessment, according to dedicated 
guidance documents. The data needed to perform a risk assessment are also 
listed as regulatory data requirements (European Commission, 2013a,b) in the 
regulation itself. Adherence to this list is part of a completeness check process 
for the active substance, its metabolites or degradation products and the Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators 197
formulated product.1 A risk assessment is performed for each anticipated use 
of a pesticide and thus for each use, the outcome of the risk assessment is 
compared to ‘Specific Protection Goals’.
Specific Protection Goals for pollinators are defined to ensure a high level 
of protection for each intended use. More specifically, they describe what to 
protect, where to protect it, and the timescale over which transient effects might 
be tolerated without affecting the protection goal, where relevant.
In the European Union, the Specific Protection Goals developed for 
pollinators are based on ecosystem services that need to be preserved in 
cultivated areas, such as pollination, the production of hive products (for 
honeybees only), and biodiversity (specifically addressed under genetic 
resources and cultural services). This approach was also proposed by experts of 
the Pellston Workshop on the Risk Assessment to Pollinators in North America 
(Fischer and Moriarty, 2014), and in most regions globally (e.g. APVMA, 2017, 
Cham et al., 2017, United States Environmental Protection Agency et al., 2014).
Protection goals valid for pollinators (and other insects) always relate to 
entities like the colony (in the case of honeybees), or the population (in the 
case of solitary bees), or to services like pollination, but never to the individual. 
This means that the individual bee is not the target of the protection goals, 
and effects on individual bees can be considered acceptable, as long as the 
population, the colony, or relevant functional endpoints are not affected. This 
is because organisms like insects are characterized by an intrinsically high loss 
rate (and colonies by an intrinsically high turnover of individuals), therefore 
effects on individuals will not necessarily result in biologically relevant effects at 
the population or colony level.
In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) defines 
the Specific Protection Goals attributes, such as survival and development of 
honey bee colonies and effects on larvae and bee behavior to preserve those 
ecosystem services (European Food Safety Authority Scientific Committee, 
2016).
For those attributes, experts have derived the magnitude of effects that 
must be met for the ecosystem services to be protected and thus for the risks 
to be acceptable. Effects can e.g. be defined as a percentage of colony size 
affected (e.g. 10%, 15%, or 20%). Exposure also enters in the Specific Protection 
Goals definition, through a given percentage of colonies located at the edge of 
a field whose exposure is to remain below the levels of exposure calculated in 
the risk assessment.2 Specific Protection Goals can be defined for other groups 
such as solitary bees and can be similar to that for the honey bee or adapted to 
their particular conditions.
1 A dossier typically counts ca 450–500 studies, 150 of which are ecotoxicological studies.
2 Specific Protection Goals were, for example, set to 7% colony size, and 90th of colonies at the edge of a field would 
be exposed to lower levels than the calculated exposure levels for a particular use.198 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
An important criterion in defining Specific Protection Goals and in particular 
the magnitude of effects to be used is the distinction of effects induced by the 
exposure to a pesticide from other effects and thus to be able to measure the 
compliance of a pesticide use to the Specific Protection Goal in situ/in the field. 
While Specific Protection Goals can be directly assessed in a field study, it may 
be necessary to define benchmark, or trigger values, to be used when the risk 
assessment relies on laboratory studies and on a comparison of ecotoxicological 
reference values derived in laboratory studies to calculated or expected 
exposure levels. Those benchmark or trigger values are then calibrated based 
on the magnitude of effect for acceptable risks. These benchmark or trigger 
values become an indicator that the acceptability criteria of the regulation are 
met on the basis of the outcome of a screening risk assessment, relying on 
screening data, and a high level of conservatism in the exposure assessment.
4.1.2 Hazard vs. risk
One of the fundamentals of each ecotoxicological risk assessment is the 
interrelation between hazard, exposure, and risk. Hazard is the potential of 
a substance to cause an effect in certain organisms; it is determined by the 
intrinsic toxicity of the substance. Risk is the product of hazard times exposure. 
Consequently, the risk may be low when exposure is lower than the thresholds 
for effects, even in case of inherently toxic substances, whereas, when exposure 
is higher than these thresholds, there may be a risk even in case of low intrinsic 
toxicity. When exposure is zero or negligible, the risk is negligible too. As for 
any other chemistry including pharmaceuticals as well as for foodstuffs, this 
also means that toxicity does not equal risk. This is commonly and intuitively 
understood for things we consume (e.g. sodium chloride, fluoride, sugar, 
caffeine, and ethanol). Paracelsus captured the concept well, ‘All things are 
poison, and nothing is without poison, the dosage alone makes it so a thing 
is not a poison’, but in the public discussion of pesticide risks, the difference 
between hazard and risk is frequently misconceived.
4.1.3 Effects and exposure
As in all risk assessment approaches, the ultimate goal of a pollinator risk 
assessment is to compare the exposure of the pollinator species under 
consideration to a substance under defined use conditions with the respective 
toxicity thresholds of the substance to the species under evaluation (e.g. 
honeybees) and to derive from this comparison the risk that the use of products 
containing the substance poses to the evaluated species.
In the case of laboratory data, measured toxicity data are compared to 
practically measured or mathematically modeled exposure data. Exposure can Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators 199
be expressed in different dimensions, e.g. concentration (quantity of substance 
per unit of a medium (e.g. diet, water, or soil)), dose (quantity of substance 
taken up per individuum of the assessed species (or per body mass unit of 
the individuum)), or rate (quantity of substance applied per area unit). Which 
dimension is relevant depends on the test design. For instance, in studies where 
animals can be individually dosed, a specific dose can be tested, whereas 
where the exact exposure per individual cannot be accurately determined 
(e.g. in water for aquatic organisms, or in honey bee colony feeding studies), 
exposure is expressed as a concentration. Where the test substance is applied 
by overspray, a relevant application rate can be established (Fig. 1). Likewise, 
effects can be measured by a variety of parameters and endpoints, the most 
important of which have been described above (Section 3.2). In higher￾tier studies, where the exposure of the test organism according to realistic 
scenarios is already a part of the study design, a quantitative comparison 
between exposure and effects can be omitted since both elements are already 
integral parts of the study design (Fig. 1).
4.1.4 Assessment factors and risk quotients
The result of a study is expressed as an endpoint, i.e. an exposure concentration, 
dose, or rate which is causing a defined effect (or no effect) to the test organism. 
In risk assessment, there are frequently additional assessment factors (or safety 
factors) applied against an endpoint. Assessment factors serve to introduce 
an additional margin of safety, to account for natural variability of the test 
system, and to compensate for inter-species variabilities where a test organism 
is a representative surrogate organism, covering other species too. Typically, 
the lower the tier of the study used to generate an endpoint, the higher the 
assessment (safety) factor. Lower-tier study endpoints may not be directly 
defined as a safe concentration in the assessment unless an assessment factor 
(or safety factor) is applied against them. In toxicology and ecotoxicology in 
general, assessment factors span from one up to 1000, depending on the 
study type, the number of studies that have been performed of the respective 
type, and the test organism.3 LD50 endpoints are almost always used in the 
connection with a substantial assessment factor, accounting for the fact that 
the underlying studies are lower-tier, and to account for the relevant protection 
goals in the risk assessment. Endpoints derived from higher-tier studies can 
typically be directly used in the risk assessment and mostly do not require an 
assessment factor since their design is close to realistic field conditions.
3 For example, the derivation of a PNEC or Predicted No Effect Concentration for aquatic organisms uses a factor of 
1,000 when a limited number of acute toxicity studies is available, 100 and 10 for acute and chronic studies where 
both are available and the PNEC will be the lower of the two values (European Chemicals Agency 2008).200 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Especially in lower-tier risk assessment, the application of an assessment 
factor against a toxicity endpoint is frequently done in the calculation of a 
risk quotient. Risk quotients include the Hazard Quotient (HQ), the Exposure￾Toxicity Ratio (ETR), and the Toxicity-Exposure Ratio (TER). All these quotients 
are based on a division of an exposure value by a toxicity value (HQ, ETR) or 
reversely (TER). These are compared to a trigger value reflecting the protection 
goal or can directly include the assessment factor.4
Whether the outcome of this calculation is above or below a pre-defined 
trigger value indicates whether the evaluated use can, at the respective tier of 
the risk assessment, be considered safe, or whether a risk cannot be excluded 
at this tier. For example, in the assessment of chronic risks to adult bees, with a 
TER trigger of 10, a dietary concentration of the evaluated substance of 2 mg/
kg diet, and an NOEC of 30 mg/kg diet as the relevant toxicological endpoint, 
the TER would be calculated as 30 divided by 2, i.e. 15, meaning that the 
exposure is 15 times lower than the threshold for toxicity. In such a case the use 
could therefore be considered safe.
Where the dimensions of the toxicity endpoint and the exposure endpoint 
are not the same (e.g. effect data expressed as mg substance ingredient/bee 
and exposure data expressed as mg active substance/kg diet), conversion 
factors have to be included in the equation in order to make them directly 
comparable. A specific case is the HQ as used in the EPPO Risk Assessment 
Scheme (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization, 2010b). 
In this approach, exposure (expressed as an application rate of the product 
or substance under evaluation in g/ha) is divided by an effect endpoint (an 
LD50 expressed in µg/bee). Here, the different dimensions of numerator and 
denominator are not adapted by an adjustment factor. In contrast, the approach 
is based on a systematic evaluation of historic incident data undertaken by 
Aldridge and Hart (1993) that established a relationship between the HQ and 
the likelihood of a respective pesticide use to be involved in bee intoxications 
in the field. Pesticide uses with a HQ greater than the trigger value of 2500 were 
frequently implicated in incidents. Uses with an HQ smaller than 50, however, 
can be considered intrinsically safe according to their analysis. Thus far, the HQ 
in this approach is one of the few evaluation factors in ecotoxicology which 
have been validated against realistic field data.
4.2 Tiered risk assessment systems
A risk assessment system based on studies of different tiers is called a tiered risk 
assessment system. Therein, the different study tiers as described in the previous 
4 Note that additional refinement or correction factors may be included in the expression of exposure in the risk 
equation.Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators 201
section are mirrored, and their specific strengths and limitations accordingly 
inform the respective risk assessment steps or tiers (see e.g. Alix and Lewis, 
2010) (Fig. 1). Lower-tier (especially laboratory) studies are most suitable to 
determine the intrinsic toxicity of a substance to a test organism; on the other 
hand, they are normally not appropriate to directly deduce information about 
the existence of a risk that a substance may pose under realistic conditions. Since 
they exclude all naturally mitigating factors, their results, if directly extrapolated 
to field conditions, would frequently lead to an overestimation of risks. Higher￾tier studies, in contrast, are suitable for directly deducing information about 
potential risks of a test substance; the more realistic the scenario is, the better. 
Especially field studies are complex in their setup, their conduction requires 
significant efforts and resources, and the interpretation of their results needs 
to be based on expert judgment. Whereas lower-tier studies, since focusing 
on intrinsic features of the test substance and the test organism, are universally 
valid, the extrapolatability of higher-tier studies may be more limited, especially 
when they do not represent worst-case conditions in all parameters, or when 
specific scenarios (e.g. in terms of crop, environmental conditions, application 
of the test substance) are tested, which do not reflect standard conditions.
Risk assessment systems in which lower-tier and higher-tier studies are 
related to each other in a hierarchical configuration are called tiered, hierarchical 
systems (Fig. 1). They aim at assessing the compliance of pesticide products with 
defined protection goals, based on a stepwise approach to assessing effects 
and risks, from highly standardized laboratory-derived parameters to realistic 
field studies. All existing major risk assessment schemes for bees belong to this 
category. The rationale of such a system is that different studies and their results 
have a different weight and a different significance for the understanding of a 
potential risk. The more realistic a study design and an exposure regime is, the 
higher weight is assigned to a study tier, and the results of a higher-tier study 
can override the results of a lower-tier study.
In terms of study conduction in the framework of a risk assessment scheme, 
most systems are operating as follows: the first studies to be conducted are 
lower-tier studies. In the case of substances that are intrinsically non-toxic to 
bees (as many herbicides and fungicides), there are no adverse effects seen 
even under the extreme conditions of lower-tier studies. In such cases, testing 
can stop, if the findings of the toxicity test in connection with the expected 
exposure under field conditions clearly suggest the absence of a risk. If the 
results of the tested tier do not attest to the absence of a risk, the next testing 
tier is triggered. This process continues up to the tier where the safety of the 
product can be demonstrated, including risk mitigation measures where 
needed. In other words, if the outcome of the risk assessment does not meet 
the benchmark or trigger value indicating a safe use, this suggests that a refined 
risk assessment is needed, which assesses whether or not the pesticide meets 202 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
the Specific Protection Goals under the proposed conditions of use, based on 
high-tier studies in tunnels or open field (European Commission, 2011a).
To some degree, studies of a lower-tier may be waived, if studies of the 
next higher-tier are available (e.g. Alix and Lewis, 2010). For instance, if a field 
study is provided, a corresponded semi-field study may not be necessary. 
If there are adverse effects even in the highest tiers, use restrictions for the 
product to minimize exposure need to be designed, or the product cannot be 
registered for the respective use.
The advantage of the tiered system is that intrinsically low-toxic 
substances can be filtered out early and with a limited effort, so that the focus 
can be directed to substances that have a higher intrinsic toxicity, allowing 
unnecessary complex higher-tier tests on intrinsically safe substances to be 
avoided.
An example of the application of the tiered system is provided in Box 1. 
Box 1 Case study: Honey bee safety of the 
neonicotinoids
One of the most controversially discussed topics related to 
pesticide environmental compatibility is the honey bee safety of the 
neonicotinoids (e.g. Eisenstein, 2015). This is a class of insecticides 
which selectively act on insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and 
which are on the market since the 1990s (Jeschke and Nauen, 2010). 
Due to their efficacy against pest insects, their systemicity in plant 
tissues, which allows their use as seed and soil treatment, and their 
high level of operator safety, they are widely used in a broad variety of 
crops (Jeschke and Nauen, 2010). A sub-class of the neonicotinoids, 
the so-called nitro-substituted neonicotinoids exhibit a high intrinsic 
toxicity to bees, yet of a comparable order of magnitude as other 
insecticide classes; imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin for 
instance belong to this group (Iwasa et al., 2003).
In the mid-1990s, seed treatment applications of imidacloprid in 
sunflower in France were suspected as a cause of honey bee colony 
losses due to systemic residues in nectar and pollen (Maus et al., 
2003). In 2008, a severe incident took place in Germany where a 
significant number of bee colonies were intoxicated by dust particles 
from clothianidin-coated corn seeds of deficient seed treatment 
quality (Forster, 2009, Nikolakis et al., 2009). In the early 2010s, some 
studies about sublethal effects of neonicotinoids to bees attracted the 
attention of the public and the scientific and regulatory communities 
(Henry et al., 2012, Whitehorn et al., 2012), which triggered political and 
regulatory processes which eventually led to far-reaching regulatory 
restrictions for imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin in the 
European Union (European Commission, 2013c, 2018a,b,c), whereas 
they are continued to be used in other regions of the world, yet in Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators 203
some countries with use adaptations in order to optimize their bee 
safety.
The regulatory risk assessment for the neonicotinoids under discussion 
is driven by higher-tier data, which exemplifies the principles of risk 
assessment as outlined in this chapter. The substances usually do not 
pass the lower-tier risk assessment due to their intrinsic toxicity to bees. 
Therefore, higher-tier studies had to be performed, or risk mitigation 
measures minimizing exposure were stipulated. For seed treatment 
uses which can lead to trace level residues in nectar and pollen of 
treated crops (and, to some degree also of succeeding crops), the 
regulatory risk assessment is largely based on colony feeding study 
data in combination with residue data from bee-relevant matrices in 
treated and succeeding crops (second tier), and field data (third tier). 
These data largely revealed no or little concern about exposed honey 
bee colonies (e.g. Maus et al., 2003, Schmuck and Keppler, 2003, 
Schmuck et al., 2005, Pilling et al., 2013, Thompson et al., 2019).5 In the 
case of foliar uses, the risk to bees can in practice be easily mitigated 
by the avoidance of application during flowering of the crop and the 
restriction of pre-flowering applications.
Public concerns about the neonicotinoids were predominantly 
triggered by studies on sublethal effects which were conducted off 
the regulatory study system and mostly off the regulatory standards 
for safety studies. Hundreds of studies on neonicotinoid sublethal 
effects have been published (e.g. by Godfray et al., 2014, 2015, Siviter 
et al., 2021). The existence of sublethal effects as such is neither 
new nor unexpected, since any intrinsically toxic substance which 
is administered at a non-lethal level will inherently cause sublethal 
effects at certain exposure concentrations. This principle is well 
known to us from substances of our everyday life (caffeine, sodium 
chloride, ethanol, glucose). However, it is important to consider 
that most of the studies which have been conducted on sublethal 
effects were done in the laboratory (or under otherwise unrealistic 
exposure conditions) and with individual honeybees rather than 
with honey bee colonies. Moreover, exposure concentrations were 
not reflecting realistic field exposure scenarios in the vast majority 
of cases (see e.g. Carreck and Ratnieks, 2014). Accordingly, most of 
these studies would in a regulatory system be categorized as first￾tier studies (see Fig. 1), which can inform about the intrinsic toxicity 
of the test substance, but which do not allow conclusions about the 
safety of a product under realistic conditions. Interestingly, a majority 
of studies which were conducted off the regulatory system but would 
correspond to higher-tier studies largely confirmed the conclusions 
of the regulatory risk assessment: most field studies either showed 
no or only insignificant, or only inconclusive effects to exposed honey 
bee colonies (Stadler et al., 2003, Cutler and Scott-Dupree, 2007, 
Nguyen et al., 2009, Cutler et al. 2014, Rundlöf et al., 2015, Rolke et 
al., 2016, Woodcock et al., 2017). This conclusion has in the meantime 
been confirmed by a comprehensive meta-analysis of available data 
5 The EFSA risk assessment came to a different conclusion since, among other reasons, large part of the available 
higher-tier studies was not taken into consideration (European Food Safety Authority 2013b, c, d).204 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators

on the honey bee safety of the neonicotinoids (Stephenson and 
Solomon, 2017, Solomon and Stephenson, 2017a,b). This case study 
illustrates the critical importance of interpreting individual studies in 
their context and according to their purpose and context, which can 
be fundamentally different between the regulatory framework and 
academic research.
4.3 Risk assessment schemes and guidance documents
Risk assessment schemes or guidance documents provide guidance on the 
types of studies to conduct depending on the uses or product type, which 
procedures are to be used, how the study results are to be interpreted, and 
how the different study types and their results relate to each other in the risk 
assessment.
Like guidelines, risk assessment schemes and guidance documents are 
issued by international organizations or authorities. Examples are the EPPO 
Risk Assessment Scheme (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection 
Organization, 2010b) (Europe), the EFSA Guidance Document on the Risk 
Assessment of Plant Protection Products on Bees (European Food Safety 
Authority, 2013a) (European Union), the Guidance for Assessing Pesticide Risks 
to Bees (United States Environmental Protection Agency et al., 2014) (USA, 
Canada), the Guidance on Exposure and Effects Testing for Assessing Risks to 
Bees (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2016) (USA, Canada), the 
Manual de Avaliação de Risco Ambiental de Agrotóxicos para Abelhas (Cham 
et al., 2017) (Brazil), and the Roadmap for Insect Pollinator Risk Assessment 
in Australia (Australian Pesticide and Veterinary Medicines Authority, 2017) 
(Australia).
Since the publication of the first risk assessment scheme for pollinators 
by EPPO in 1992 (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization, 
1992), various countries and geographical regions have developed their own 
guidance documents for pollinator risk assessment. A summary of their main 
contents including protection goals, testing requirements, and risk assessment 
principles are outlined in Table 2 for the European Union, North America, Brazil, 
and Japan, which taken together represent the diversity that may be observed 
in the existing risk assessment schemes. The risk assessment schemes in 
other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Mexico 
have adapted and updated the North American standards to meet their own 
specificities.
Risk assessment schemes in all regions are based on comparable 
protection goals and thus share similar perspectives on the role and 
importance of pollinators to agriculture, beekeeping, and biodiversity. For Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.

a The EPPO Risk Assessment Scheme has officially been withdrawn in 2018 (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization 2021), but is effectively still

study requirements, OECD guidelines remain the standard for all regions to 
address intrinsic toxicity assessments. For risk assessment calculations, most 
schemes primarily focus on direct exposure to a treated crop through oral and 
contact exposure routes, though e.g. in the European Union other possible 
exposure routes have been added to the scheme (see Chapter 15). Trigger 
values, also called levels of concern in North America, usually distinguish acute 
and chronic risk assessments. The EFSA Scheme has introduced additional 
distinctions between bee life stages and species, based on the models and 
calculations used to derive those trigger values.
Despite the differences between the approaches, the systems are based 
on the same principles and fundamentals, and theoretically lead to largely 
similar results in most cases, yet the margin of discretion which is granted in 
all systems may in practice lead to diverging conclusions in individual cases. 
All systems consider higher-tier tests under realistic exposure conditions, 
which are mostly required for intrinsically toxic substances, as overriding 
other study types. In contrast to the other systems, the EFSA system does not 
discriminate and filter out intrinsically non-toxic products in the first tiers, while 
simultaneously complicating higher-tier testing options by extremely rigorous 
requirements for study validity. The EFSA Scheme has so far not been fully 
implemented in the European Union, among other reasons because methods 
to experimentally measure the protection goals proposed in the document are 
lacking. A revised version has been prepared by EFSA (EFSA, 2019) and is up 
for public commenting (EFSA 2022).
5 Indirect and sublethal effects
Indirect effects are an important source of uncertainty in the risk assessment. For 
pollinators, indirect effects may result from effects of pesticides on habitat and 
food resource or quality. Hence weed management (chemical or mechanical) 
could result in indirect effects that affect the survival of a colony to a similar 
extent as direct effects.
In the regulatory risk assessment of pesticides, indirect effects on pollinators 
are addressed through the risk assessment performed for non-target plants 
that are present at the edge of a field and may be exposed to spray drift, for 
example. This risk assessment is performed for all types of products including 
herbicides and plant-growth regulators, and guidance documents are available 
that provide detailed recommendations on how to perform laboratory and field 
studies (European Commission, 2002, Arts et al., 2017).
Besides effects on mortality or reproduction, pesticides may affect other 
parameters such as behavior, longevity, immune defense, sensory perception, 
cognitive skills, and many others. Such effects are referred to as sublethal 
effects. Relatively little is known about how far sublethal effects may affect bee Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators 207
colonies or populations in a way that would be measurable on the basis of 
population parameters. In fact, there are very few documented cases where 
an adverse impact at the honey bee colony level has been seen to be caused 
by sublethal effects in a field-realistic scenario. Therefore, sublethal effects that 
are measurable at the level of individual honeybees may not necessarily be 
biologically relevant effects, or do at least not necessarily affect the protection 
goal ( see e.g. Henry et al., 2015, Siede et al., 2017). In existing risk assessment 
systems, sublethal effects are mostly accounted for in the same study types 
that are also assessing mortality and other standard endpoints (e.g. Thompson 
and Maus, 2007). Some study designs have been developed to test for specific 
sublethal effects (e.g. OECD GD 332, effects on homing capability (OECD, 
2021c)), but they are not mandatory in most risk assessment schemes, as our 
understanding of the biological significance of sublethal effects is limited. 
However, sublethal effects can generally be considered to be essentially 
covered by the existing testing methods, as they would either manifest in 
effects on other endpoints (e.g. mortality, foraging, reproduction, and colony 
performance) or alternatively would not be relevant in relation to the protection 
goal.
6 Risk mitigation
Where the outcome of the risk assessment does not exclude the presence of 
risks to pollinators under practical use conditions of a product, risk mitigations 
have to be defined to ensure a safe use by minimizing exposure. The 
registration process for pesticides in the European Union defines specific risk 
mitigation measures to accompany the registration of pesticides where they 
are triggered by the outcome of the risk assessment (European Parliament 
and Council of the European Union, 2009). Risk mitigation measures for 
pesticides may be implemented at various levels. The regulations stipulate a 
range of precautionary or safety phrases describing appropriate conditions 
of use on the product’s labeling (European Commission, 2011b). Labeling 
recommendations can hence reduce exposure of both managed and wild 
bees (for examples see Box 2 Safety phrases on product labels). For managed 
species, beekeepers can also efficiently manage colonies in space and time 
thanks to adapted recommendations. Mitigation measures may include a 
variety of crop or hive management approaches that reduce the exposure 
of bees to the treatment, and which are defined on a case-by-case basis, 
considering the intrinsic properties and characteristics of the product, the 
crop, and pollinator species of concern in the mitigation measure. Examples 
are avoiding applications during flowering and during pre-flowering safety 
intervals depending on the residual toxicity of the product, applications in the 
evening after daily bee flight, avoiding spray drift to bee-attractive crops or 208 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
weeds, removal of flowering weeds in the crop’s understory before application, 
or covering or removal of bee hives in or nearby the crop prior to the treatment 
(see e.g. Australian Government – Rural Industries Research and Development 
Corporation, 2012, Hooven et al., 2013, CropLife International, 2017, Johansen 
and Wu-Smart, 2021). Label information is mandatory and is implemented 
in all countries, adapted to national situations and farming practices, and 
designed specifically for each product. These mitigation methods have been 
developed with a focus on honeybees and may not in all cases applicable to 
wild pollinators.
Box 2 Safety phrases on product labels
Examples of safety phrases on product labels to protect pollinators
European Union (European Commission, 2003):
SPe 8: Dangerous to bees./To protect bees and other pollinating 
insects do not apply to crop plants when in flower./Do not use 
where bees are actively foraging./Remove or cover beehives during 
application and for (state time) after treatment./Do not apply when 
flowering weeds are present./Remove weeds before flowering./Do 
not apply before (state time).
Australia (Australian Pesticide and Veterinary Medicines Authority, 
2018):
Mandatory label for ‘Protection of Livestock’ with the precaution to 
not spray onto bees or beehives and the mention that ‘once the spray 
deposit has dried, foraging bees will not be affected’.
New Zealand (New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries, 2020):
‘POLLINATORS: When applied during non-foraging periods the 
Product will not interfere with the activity of honeybees once the 
spray has dried. At least 3 hours drying time should occur before 
bee foraging is expected. At times when bees aggregate in large 
numbers outside the hive, ensure they are not directly contacted by 
the spray.’
United States (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2021b):
‘This product is toxic to bees exposed to treatment during the 3 hours 
following treatment. Do not apply this pesticide to blooming, pollen￾shedding or nectar-producing parts of plants if bees may forage on 
the plants during this time period.’
Besides labelling of pesticides, crop management practices adopted by 
farmers at the farm scale may greatly reduce exposure of pollinating species 
visiting crops (Alix and Garrido, 2015, Alix et al., 2017). A range of farm 
management tools beneficial to pollinators has been identified, ranging from Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators 209
establishing natural and semi-natural field margins to managed field margins, 
dedicated pollen and nectar seed mixes, wildflower sown margins, grass 
strips, or conservation headlands. Each provides advantages to pollinating 
insects, either as a refuge area or in providing a dedicated source of food or 
nesting habitat. A ranking of the benefits represented by each type of farm 
management was provided by the MAgPIE Project.
An inventory of mitigation measures for pollinators has been compiled 
by the OECD-PEIP working group (OECD, 2021e). The inventory includes 
regulatory risk mitigation recommendations as communicated through 
the information on pesticide labels, and education and training programs. 
Education and training programs for farmers and beekeepers are also key 
components of risk management as they drive the accuracy with which risk 
mitigation measures are implemented. These programs may be organized by 
any stakeholder and are most often voluntary initiatives, thus indicating a real 
commitment of countries.
7 Pesticide incident monitoring
Monitoring approaches aim to assess the potential effects of pesticides used in 
crop protection according to label recommendations under practical conditions 
on specific populations and communities. These studies complement the risk 
assessment performed under relevant regulations (European Parliament and 
Council of the European Union, 2009) and describe the conditions of exposure 
of organisms in their environment, the conditions of occurrence of risks, and 
provide in situ assessment of the efficacy of risk mitigation measures that 
were recommended thus enabling further adaptation based on the collected 
information.
Despite an increasing interest in field observations of pesticide impacts on 
pollinators, there is to date no harmonized regulatory guidance or monitoring 
methodology for honeybees or other pollinating species, nor is there regulatory 
guidance on the use of generated data in support of risk assessment or decision 
making. An inventory of published monitoring studies was undertaken by the 
International Commission on Plant-Pollinator Relationship (ICPPR) a few years 
ago (Alix and Garrido, 2015), which analyzed 24 monitoring studies and was 
further expanded to 56 studies in 2016, as a basis for a possible guidance 
on good monitoring practices. The analysis of the data revealed distinct 
approaches depending on the species monitored and on the purpose of the 
study. For managed species, the baseline can be defined at the introduction 
or release of pollinators in the cultivated system whereas wild bees require 
setting study designs reflecting ecological approaches to first define the 
expected occurrence and diversity from the collected environmental features 
of the ecosystem. In both cases, a dedicated description of the environment 210 Assessing the impact of pesticides on pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
is critical to the interpretation of the data. There is a need to gather existing 
knowledge on the specific landscape management initiatives and their benefits 
to pollinators in cropping systems in order to build a decision tree to assess 
the potential of a crop to induce pollinator exposure and to identify the risk 
mitigation measures and crop management actions with the highest potential 
to limit exposure. However, limited knowledge is available on species traits and 
relationship to specific flora to accurately predict the expected community in a 
particular crop system, which would define which species need to be protected 
and where.
Projects that are initiated should allow a better implementation of 
monitoring data collection, as for example in the European Union (European 
Commission, 2021) and propose protocols. A first financial analysis shows 
that despite the relatively high financial costs of systematic monitoring data 
generation, the benefits to pollinated crops and systems from the resulting 
learning can largely compensate these expenses (Breeze et al., 2020). Besides 
a harmonized method to collect data that can be compared and used to 
feedback to regulatory processes, basic ecological data are needed to better 
understand plant-bee relationships and depict the species and assemblage of 
species that can be expected in particular systems, to inform protection goals 
and design risk assessments and monitoring.
In some countries, there are passive monitoring systems in place, where 
reported incidents of bee intoxications are investigated by official institutions to 
analyze whether an incidence of mortality was caused by pesticide intoxication 
and, if so, which products and application practices were involved. Examples 
for such incident monitoring approaches are the British Wildlife Incident 
Investigation Scheme, the Incident Monitoring of the Julius Kühn Institute in 
Germany, and the Pesticide Incident Reporting Program in Canada (Seefeld, 
2006, Barnett et al., 2007, Thompson and Thorbahn, 2009, Mineau et al., 2008, 
Julius-Kühn-Institut, 2021a,b, Government of Canada, 2018, 2021).
8 Conclusion
Overall, the development of the described approaches and efforts, which have 
been continuously extended and refined over the last decades, underscores the 
importance of bees and other pollinators for agriculture and crop protection. 
Incident monitoring systems confirm that in countries where systematic long￾term figures are available, numbers of bee intoxications with pesticides have 
shown a decreasing trend over the last decades and are currently on low 
absolute numbers (e.g. Thompson and Thorbahn, 2009, Carreck and Ratnieks, 
2014). This reflects the improvement in the level of protection provided 
by regulatory systems developed over the years as well as the increasing 
awareness of the importance of pollinator protection among the involved Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.

stakeholders. Nonetheless, environmental safety testing and risk assessment 
schemes in regulatory ecotoxicology are not static constructs, but dynamic 
systems, which can be constantly optimized to always reflect the latest state of 
science and address emerging research issues; in so far, we can expect further 
new developments and optimizations in the years to come.

1 Introduction
A species introduced outside of its native range, voluntarily or not, is defined 
as an alien species (Blackburn et al., 2011). These alien species may become 
invasive if their establishment and spread negatively affect biodiversity, 
ecosystem functioning, and/or the economy (Diagne et al., 2021). Biological 
invasions are among the most important threats to biodiversity worldwide 
(Kumschick et al., 2015). Frequently pointed out as the second cause of 
species extinction (Bellard et al., 2016a), the magnitude of negative effects 
of invasive alien species on biodiversity is nevertheless still regularly debated 
in the literature (Courchamp et al., 2017). With the exponential rise in global 
trade, the number of alien species has increased in the past few years (Bellard 
et al., 2016b), and projections forecast a continuous growth in the number of 
introductions in the following 30 years (Seebens et al., 2017, 2020).
Among alien species, insects have been less studied (Kenis et al., 2009) 
despite the importance of their reported negative effects on biodiversity 
components, especially the ones exerted by social insects such as termites or 
ants (Bertelsmeier, 2021). Notably, this is the case for bees, be they social or 
solitary, managed or wild (Russo, 2016; Geslin et al., 2017; Russo et al., 2021). 
Indeed, bees are generally well-perceived by the public (Sumner et al., 2018)

mostly because of their important role in the reproduction of wild (Ollerton 
et al., 2011) and cultivated plants (Klein et al., 2007; Gill et al., 2016). Therefore, 
because of this beneficial role, little attention is paid when an alien bee species 
enters a new ecosystem.
However, to date, Russo (2016) recorded 80 bee species introduced out 
of their native range (Fig. 1). Among these, Apis mellifera (L.) and Bombus 
terrestris (L.) are the two species that have been the focus of attention (Geslin 
et al., 2017; Mallinger et al., 2017; Goulson, 2003). These two social and 
domesticated species have mostly been introduced either to produce honey 
(for Apis mellifera) or to improve pollination services to crops (Aizen et al., 
2020), sometimes doing more harm than good (Aizen et al., 2014, 2019; Sáez 
et al., 2014). Of course, not all 80 alien species described by Russo (2016) 
have become invasive, but the literature report many examples of deleterious 
consequences of the introduction of bees outside their native range (Aizen 
et al., 2019, 2020; Geslin et al., 2017; Mallinger et al., 2017; Traveset and 
Richardson, 2014; Goulson, 2003).
Hence, alien bees can directly or indirectly affect native ecosystems and 
therefore become invasive (Dafni et al., 2010; Russo et al., 2021, Fig. 2). They 
can compete with native bees for the acquisition of food resources (nectar and 
pollen) or nesting sites potentially affecting local populations (Geslin et al., 
2020; Hung et al., 2019; Ollerton, 2017; Schaffer et al., 1983). Alien bees can 
transport parasites and diseases, which can, in turn, affect native populations

(Aizen et al., 2020; Goulson et al., 2015; Graystock et al., 2013). Alien bees can 
also disrupt plant–pollinator networks by robbing flowers, therefore decreasing 
their reproductive success (Dafni et al., 2010; Dohzono et al., 2008), modifying 
the amount or the nature of the pollen deposited (Agüero et al., 2020), or by 
reinforcing the pollination of particular plant species (Sanguinetti and Singer, 
2014). In some cases, alien bees can even interact preferentially with alien or 
invasive plants, potentially enhancing their spread and negative impacts, a 
phenomenon called invasional meltdown (Zakardjian et al., 2020; Traveset and 
Richardson, 2014; Beavon and Kelly, 2012).
Despite these reported effects, the impacts of alien bees on native 
ecosystems are little considered on a global scale. For example, despite the 
devastating consequences of multiple introductions of Bombus terrestris
Figure 2 Positive and negative interactions (respectively green and red links) between 
alien and native species may disrupt native plant–pollinator systems. First, alien bees 
may compete for floral resources and/or nesting sites, spread parasites and pathogens 
and hybridize with native bees (A). Then, alien bees may also not be efficient pollinators 
of some native plants (e.g. due to morphological mismatch) and could thus alter their 
reproductive success (B). Second, alien plants may compete with native ones for soil 
resources (C) and corner all or part of their pollinators (D). Finally, it seems that alien 
plants tend to promote the presence of alien bees and in some cases alien bees visit 
preferentially those plant species. Thus, alien species may promote the establishment 
and spread of each other, potentially leading to invasional meltdowns (E). All these 
interactions may lead to a local decrease of abundance and richness of native species.228 Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones

worldwide (e.g. Acosta et al., 2016), the commercial trade of Bombus species 
outside of their native range continues (Aizen et al., 2019) to the point that 
the international trade of bees, mostly bumblebees, is nowadays an important 
conservation issue for global biodiversity (Sutherland et al., 2016). Therefore, it 
is important and timely to assess the impact of alien bees on native pollinators.
This chapter focuses on the direct and indirect impacts of alien bees 
on native pollinators. We will not explore the effect of alien bees on plant 
communities or plant–pollinator networks to focus solely on their effect on native 
bees. Also, because we focus on alien bees, we will not provide examples of 
competitive interactions between wild and domestic bees in the native range 
of domestic bees. In the second part, we will focus on a case study, the invasion 
of the alien bee Megachile sculpturalis in North America and Europe. We will 
then delineate some of the main shortcomings and directions for future studies 
and guide land managers to prevent future introductions.
2 Assessment of key issues related to the introduction of 
alien bees
2.1 Direct interactions: interference competition
Interference competition is a direct interaction, generally by aggressive contact, 
through which a resource that an individual should have used is made available 
by and for another individual (Case and Gilpin, 1974). Among alien bees, 
interference competition may be used to acquire food resources, nesting sites, 
or defend mating territories. Although rare, interference competitions between 
alien and native bees have been reported in other literature.
In Yucatan (Mexico), the Africanised honey bee (Apis mellifera scutellata) 
has aggressively displaced stingless bees from floral and water resources. 
In this region, some native stingless bees appear to have declined from 
anthropogenic pressures. Interference competition by honey bees could have 
compound effects on the most vulnerable native species (Cairns et al., 2005). 
In Indiana (US), honey bees have also been observed to steal pollen loads 
directly from the body parts of several native bees such as Bombus impatiens, 
Megachile montivaga, and Melissodes desponsa (Jean, 2005). As not all 
pollen loads were removed and those events remain rare, this kind of physical 
interaction is unlikely to severely impact native bees’ fitness.
Anthidium manicatum, the most widespread unmanaged alien bee species 
worldwide (Strange et al., 2011), uses interference competition to defend floral 
territories and thus assuring mating opportunities (Starks and Reeve, 1999; 
Severinghaus et al., 1981). In New Zealand, Anthidium manicatum aggressively 
interferes with native Lasioglossum spp. (Soper and Beggs, 2013). However, 
in this study, native bees were less contacted than conspecific individuals and © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones 229
two other alien species, Apis mellifera and Bombus spp. Native Lasioglossum 
spp. shared fewer floral resources than Apis mellifera and Bombus spp. with 
Anthidium manicatum, thus reducing the probability of interference events 
(Case and Gilpin, 1974). Although the impact of these interactions was not 
tested, the authors concluded that Anthidium manicatum posed a minor threat 
to the native bee fauna of New Zealand.
In North America, Megachile spp. in an urban area experienced reduced 
visitation frequencies in the presence of Anthidium manicatum (Taggar et al., 
2021). Unfortunately, in this study, alien and native Megachile spp. were not 
discriminated and it was therefore complicated to state whether this decrease 
was due to interference or exploitative competition. A native bee, Bombus 
impatiens, was shown to avoid floral enclosures where Anthidium manicatum
was present. Even if the authors did not discriminate between interference and 
exploitative competition to explain their results, no effect was shown on the 
colony fitness of the native bumblebee (Graham et al., 2019).
In Europe and North America, several events of aggressive behaviour have 
been documented for Megachile sculpturalis. This species is likely to interfere 
with native species with similar nesting habits (see the case study below).
Physical interaction events appear to be uncommon between alien and 
native bees. Thus, interference competition is unlikely to have a deleterious 
impact on native bee populations. However, such behaviours could increase 
the potential of a species to become established or spread if coupled with 
other characteristics such as a high capability of exploitative competition for 
floral resources and nesting sites.
2.2 Exploitative competition
Alien bees may overlap with native bees in floral resource use (Fig. 3) and/
or nesting sites. Exploitative competition occurs when shared resources are 
limiting and implies negative impacts on the fitness of native bees.
2.2.1 Exploitative competition for floral resources
Managed eusocial bees, such as Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris, have 
a strong competitive potential over native wild bees. Indeed, the number of 
workers per managed colony compared to solitary bees and the regular renewal 
of populations by beekeepers (when needed) make them prone to exploit 
efficiently floral resources with potential impacts on native bees. Their impacts 
on native and invaded areas have already been reviewed by several authors 
(e.g. Aizen et al., 2020; Geslin et al., 2017; Mallinger et al., 2017; Osterman 
et al., 2021; Russo et al., 2021; Vanbergen et al., 2018), but we present here 
some examples of exploitative competition.230 Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones

A 2-year experiment conducted in Western Australia showed that the 
monolectic resource used by a native bee, Hylaeus alcyoneus, was also used 
by honey bees for pollen and nectar provision. This resource overlap appears 
to explain the decrease in native bee fecundity (measured as the number of 
nests constructed) in sites with increasing honey bee density (Paini and Roberts, 
2005). In this case, the monolectic behaviour of the native bee likely made it 
more vulnerable to exploitative competition exerted by honey bees. Another 
negative impact of honey bees on native bees was demonstrated in Tenerife 
(Canary Islands), where the number of pollinator species and that of visits by 
some native bees were lower after the setup of beehives (Valido et al., 2019). 
In this case, exploitative competition from honey bees had a negative impact 
on the richness and abundance of generalist native bees, with implications for 
pollination ecosystem services and plant reproductive success.
Conversely, some studies did not find any evidence of a detrimental effect 
of the exploitative competition exerted by alien honey bees on native bees. 
For example, the experimental increase in honey bees in a Patagonian Forest 
ecosystem did not affect the number of visits made by native pollinators but 
rather induced exploitative competition with two other invasive alien species 
(i.e. Bombus ruderatus and Bombus terrestris; Agüero et al., 2020). However, 
in this study, native pollinators were studied as a group, and contrasting 
responses between pollinator species may not have been highlighted. In an 
urban ecosystem in Montreal (Canada), an increase in honey bee capture rate 
did not affect the abundance of wild bees (McCune et al., 2019). The authors 
expected a negative effect and hypothesised that the abundance of floral

Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones 231
resources and the very low density of beehives compared with other cities (e.g. 
see Ropars et al., 2019) mitigated competition. In addition, in the Ogasawara 
islands (Japan), Apis mellifera appears to have a competitive advantage over 
native bees (Kato et al., 1999), but the decline of native pollinators is mostly due 
to an invasive predator (Abe et al., 2008). Finally, in Ontario (Canada), within 
an agroecosystem (Cucurbita spp.), Willis Chan and Raine (2021) found no 
negative impact of the alien bee Apis mellifera on the wild oligolectic hoary 
squash bees (Eucera Peponapis pruinosa) foraging on Cucurbita spp., likely 
because of an intra-day phenological difference in bees’ activities (honey bees 
were foraging later than hoary squash bees).
Another managed eusocial bee, Bombus terrestris, has been massively 
introduced worldwide and is known to have caused disastrous impacts on 
native bee populations (see below, e.g. Acosta et al., 2016; Aizen et al., 2008, 
2014, 2019; Morales and Aizen, 2006; Morales et al., 2013). In Japan, Bombus 
terrestris may be an efficient competitor for floral resources over some native 
bumblebees. For example, an experiment demonstrated that Bombus terrestris
harvested more pollen per unit time and per unit body mass than the native 
Bombus ignitus (Inoue et al., 2010). However, the evidence of exploitative 
competition effects on native bees is unclear. Indeed, an experiment failed 
to detect a negative impact of Bombus terrestris on two native Japanese 
bumblebees (Bombus ardens and Bombus hypocrita; Nagamitsu et al., 2007a). 
Nevertheless, field removal of Bombus terrestris queens from an urban area led 
to an increased number of these two native bumblebee queens among five 
native bee species captured in the study area (Nagamitsu et al., 2009). Bombus 
ardens and B. hypocrita are likely to overlap for floral resource use with Bombus 
terrestris due to their tongue length (Nagamitsu et al., 2007). Thus, although 
the effect of competition for nesting sites could not be discriminated, the 
release of exploitative competition for floral resources was a major hypothesis 
to explain these results. Corroborating this hypothesis, Bombus terrestris may 
be responsible for the increase in robbed flowers of a native plant (Corydalis 
ambigua) and the subsequent decrease in visitation by B. ardens (Dohzono 
et al., 2008).
However, in an alpine-montane ecosystem in New Zealand, alien bees 
mostly composed of Bombus terrestris did not overlap with native bees for 
floral resource use (Iwasaki et al., 2018). Indeed, Bombus terrestris preferentially 
visited alien plants when native bees were mostly observed on native ones, 
suggesting a low potential for exploitative competition for floral resources. In 
addition, 3-years monitoring conducted in Japan did not show any evidence of 
an impact of shared plant resources between Bombus terrestris and the native 
species B. pseudobaicalensis (Inoue et al., 2008).
Notably, the introduction and invasion of B. terrestris and B. ruderatus in 
South America had notorious negative impacts on native ecosystems, including 232 Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones

the decline and local extinction of B. dahlbomii, a Patagonian native bumblebee 
(Aizen et al., 2019; Geslin and Morales, 2015; Morales et al., 2013; Morales, 
2007). In particular, B. ruderatus overlaps with B. dahlbomii for floral resources 
(Aizen et al., 2008; Morales and Aizen, 2006). However, Aizen et al. (2011) found 
no evidence of exploitative competition for floral resources between these two 
species, and the spread of pathogens is a favoured hypothesis to explain the 
decline of B. dahlbomii (see Section 2.3).
When first recorded in a new environment, alien solitary bees generally raise 
concerns about potential negative impacts on native species. Unfortunately, 
for most of these species, field studies following their detection rarely test for 
their effect on the fitness of native bee populations. However, a recent study 
analysing historical pan trap records in the US showed that the arrival of two 
alien bees, Osmia cornifrons, and especially Osmia taurus, was followed by 
a decline in six native Osmia spp. (LeCroy et al., 2020). Several factors have 
been hypothesised to explain this result, including exploitative competition, 
either for floral resources or nesting sites. Another study conducted in the US 
showed that urban sites with a high density of alien bees were associated with 
a lower abundance of native bees (Fitch et al., 2019). Once again, exploitative 
competition for floral resources, nesting sites, or spillover of pathogens were all 
hypothesised to explain these observations.
The effects of wild alien bees on native bees are also context-dependent. 
A study conducted in an insular system in the Southwest Pacific showed 
that the presence of alien bees did not affect the number of visits realised 
by native ones (Zakardjian et al., 2020). However, this result was explained 
by the generalist foraging behaviour of some insular native bees. In Brazil, a 
study conducted in an urban area found no impact from two alien bee species 
(Apis mellifera and Anthidium manicatum) on the structure of the native bee 
community (Graf et al., 2020), suggesting that no exploitative competition 
occurred. The authors proposed two hypotheses to explain this result. First, 
it is possible that these two alien bees, which were introduced a few decades 
ago, had an impact at the beginning of their establishment. Second, the urban 
environment may not be suitable for the species that are the most vulnerable 
to competition.
Most studies estimate niche overlap and the displacement of visits without 
measuring the impact of competition on native bee fitness. However, these 
metrics still reveal an effect of the competitive pressure exerted by alien bees 
on native ones. Mixed responses of native bees to exploitative competition 
by alien ones reveal that competitive pressure is context-dependent, varying 
according to the ecosystem (number of floral resources), the capacity of native 
bees to adapt their foraging preferences, and the characteristics of alien bees, 
such as their level of generalism and their reproductive success.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

2.2.2 Exploitative competition for nesting sites
Bombus terrestris has the potential to compete with native bumblebees for 
nesting resources. In Japan, 3 years of monitoring studied the abundance 
of three native bumblebees, along with the abundance of Bombus terrestris
queens. The results showed that a native species using the same nesting 
resources as Bombus terrestris declined with an increase in Bombus terrestris
queens, suggesting exploitative competition for nesting sites between these 
two species (Inoue et al., 2008).
Concerning wild alien bees, Megachile sculpturalis has been reported 
to be a potential competitor for nesting resources (see above). In Marseille 
(France), near its first detection point, the presence of Megachile sculpturalis in 
bee hotels reduced the probability of occupation by native Osmia spp. (Geslin 
et al., 2020).
2.3 Apparent competition (pathogens spillover)
Parasites and pathogens may be transferred among bee species when infected 
individuals are abundant and share floral resources or nesting sites with other 
species. Thus, bees are ideal candidates for the transmission and dispersion of 
pathogens.
In New York State (US), the presence of the deformed wing virus (DWV; 
Fig. 4) in some native Melandrena spp. was linked to honey bee abundance 
(Murray et al., 2019). Even if there was no correlation with two other pathogens 
(black queen cell virus and sacbrood virus), these results indicate that honey 
bees may be a source of infection for solitary native bees, potentially increasing 
viral incidence for at least DWV. Still in North America, wild pollinators found 
close to beehives with honey bees infected with Israeli acute paralysis virus 
also presented this virus, contrary to wild pollinators captured close to healthy 
beehives (Singh et al., 2010). Similarly, Alger et  al. (2019) found a strong 
prevalence of DWV in wild bumblebees foraging close to apiaries, whereas no 
DWV was found in bumblebees in the absence of honey bees.
In Argentina, Apicystis bombi, a parasite that especially infects bumble￾bees, was possibly co-introduced with Bombus terrestris or B. ruderatus
(Arbetman et al., 2012; Plischuk et al., 2011) and is now also present in 
Colombia (Gamboa et al., 2015) and Patagonia (Arbetman et al., 2012). In 
Patagonia, it appears that the alien B. ruderatus and the native B. dahlbomii
were free of this parasite before the invasion of Bombus terrestris (Arbetman 
et al., 2012). Thus, A. bombi likely arrived with and spilt over from Bombus 
terrestris to these two bumblebee species. The severe decline of B. dahlbomii
is potentially linked to this parasite spillover (Arbetman et al., 2012).234 Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones

2.4 Mating interference
In Korea, laboratory experiments demonstrated that interspecific hybridisation 
may happen between Bombus terrestris and two native bumblebees (B. ignitus
and B. hypocrita). Males of the two native species mated with Bombus terrestris
queens (Yoon et al., 2011, 2009). Thus, Bombus terrestris may interfere with 
native bumblebees for mating males, with potential negative impacts on native 
bees’ fitness. In addition, during this experiment, Bombus terrestris males mated 
with native bumblebee queens, highlighting a risk of genetic contamination.
3 Case study: Megachile sculpturalis
3.1 History of introduction and spread
Megachile (Callomegachile) sculpturalis Smith (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) 
– (Msc) is a wild bee species native to Southeast Asia (Korea, China, Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, and Japan; Fig. 5). We chose this species as a case study because 
it was the first alien bee to enter the European continent in 2008 (Vereecken 
and Barbier, 2009), and its spread and impacts have been carefully followed 
since (Le Féon et al., 2018, 2021). Before arriving in Europe, however, Msc
colonised the North American continent. The first mention of Msc outside of 
its native range dates from 1994 in North Carolina (US; Magnum and Brooks, 
1997). Since then, the species has rapidly been detected in other US states, up

Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones 235
to Texas in 2011 (Parys et al., 2015; Hinojosa-Díaz, 2008). Besides the US, Msc
has also expanded its range to Canada, especially in Ontario (Paiero and Buck, 
2003).
In Europe, Msc was first detected in Allauch, a small city close to Marseille 
(France; Vereecken and Barbier, 2009). Between 2008 and 2021, Msc has 
remarkably extended its range in France, with a reported presence in 259 
different cities, with the most northern location being approximately 800 km 
from Marseille, in the northeast of Paris (near Reims, Le Féon et al., 2021). Msc
now occupies approximately half of France, from the Atlantic coast to the Alps 
(Le Féon et al., 2018, 2021; Le Féon and Geslin, 2018). Besides France, Msc has 
also spread to many European countries, starting with Italy in 2009 (Quaranta 
et al., 2014), Switzerland in 2010 (Amiet, 2012), Germany (Westrich et al. 2015), 
and Hungary in 2015 (Kovàcs, 2015), Slovenia in 2016 (Gogala and Zadravec, 
2018), Austria (Westrich, 2017) and Serbia (Ćetković et al., 2020) in 2017, Spain 
(Ortiz-Sánchez et al., 2018) and Crimean peninsula (Ivanov and Fateryga, 2019) 
in 2018, Croatia (inaturalist.org) and Lichtenstein (Lanner et al., 2020a) in 2019, 
and finally in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2020 (inaturalist.org; Fig. 6). Megachile 
sculpturalis is therefore now widespread in Europe and occupies several 
habitats from very urbanised ones such as Marseille, Lyon, or Vienna (Geslin 
et al., 2020; Lanner et al., 2020b; Fortel et al., 2016), to montane habitats (up to 
1846 m above sea level; Le Féon and Geslin, 2018).
The spread of this species is remarkably fast even if similar dispersal 
rates have been reported for other invasive hymenopterans such as Bombus 
terrestris in South America (Schmid-Hempel et al., 2014) or Vespa velutina in 
Europe (Robinet et al., 2017). One of the hypotheses explaining this fast spread

Westrich et al., 2015; Westrich, 2017). The homogeneous colouring of national territories can be misleading. For example, concerning the islands, 
Msc is so far unknown in Corsica, Sicily, and Sardinia. However, it has been recorded on the island of Elba and in Majorca, islands that we have 
circled in red. Map made with QGIS version 3.14. Base map downloaded from Natural Earth (naturalearthdata.com).© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones 237
lies in the nesting preferences of Msc (in deadwood and cavities, see below), 
and Msc may have benefited from the timber trade through human-mediated 
transportation (e.g. Le Féon et al., 2018). Using the species distribution model 
(Lanner et al., 2022) recently showed that the spread of Msc is largely explained 
by anthropogenic factors and particularly facilitated by roads and maritime 
traffic. Through genetic analysis, Lanner et al. (2021) have also emphasised that 
several introductions may have occurred in Europe, partly explaining the rapid 
geographical expansion of Msc.
3.2 The morphology and ecology of Megachile sculpturalis
One of the vernacular names of Megachile sculpturalis is the giant resin bee. 
This appellation comes from the nesting biology of Msc, which closes its nest 
and brood cells with resin mainly collected from coniferous trees. Megachile 
sculpturalis is a large bee species (male 14–19 mm; female 22–27 mm; Batra, 
1998), with orange to brown hairs on the thorax and infuscated wings (Fig. 5). 
The head is dark, with large mandibles used by females to carry mud and resin 
to build their nests (Fig. 7). Females carry pollen for their larvae in their ventral 
scopa.
Bees forage on flowers to gather pollen and nectar. While nectar is useful 
as a direct energy source for both adults and larvae, pollen is the principal 
source of protein and is gathered mostly to feed the larvae. Bees can be

a generalist when seeking for nectar but can be more of a specialist when 
foraging for a particular pollen. Megachile sculpturalis is a generalist species 
when it comes to nectar, meaning that this species can visit many different 
plant families. For example, in France, Msc has been observed foraging on 
20 different plant species from 8 families, including Asteraceae (i.e. Cirsium 
arvense), Capriofoliacea (i.e. Scabiosa columbaria), and Lamiaceae (i.e. 
Lavendula) (Le Féon et al., 2018). However, for pollen, Msc appears to be more 
specialist with strong preferences for alien woody species also originating from 
Asia. In Europe, Msc is known for gathering pollen from alien tree species such 
as Sophora japonica (Fabaceae; Andrieu-Ponel et al., 2018) and collecting 
nectar from Ligustrum lucidum (native to Asia) and Ligustrum vulgare (native to 
Europe) (Oleaceae; Aguado et al., 2018).
Megachile sculpturalis nests in pre-existing cavities, mostly in deadwood, 
bamboo, or reeds. As stated earlier, Msc closes its nest entrances with resin, 
vegetal fibres, mud, and clay. Female Msc widely uses insect hotels (or bee 
hotels) to lay eggs, with much evidence in North America (MacIvor and Packer, 
2015) and Europe (Díaz et al., 2021; Geslin et al., 2020; Le Féon et al., 2018; 
Fortel et al., 2016; Quaranta et al., 2014, Fig. 7). This propensity to nest in 
human-made structures may also be the reason for the rapid spread of Msc in 
Europe (Lanner et al., 2022).
3.3 Impacts on native bees
The first insight into the potential impacts of Megachile sculpturalis on native 
fauna was published in 2012 (Roulston and Malfi, 2012). The authors reported an 
aggressive eviction of a native carpenter bee (Xylocopa virginica) from its nest 
by Msc in Virginia (US). In the same year, Laport and Minckley (2012) reported 
the occupation of a nest of an active X. virginica by Msc. Both observations 
suggest potential nest competition between Msc and local fauna, together 
with aggressive territorial behaviours. Similar observations were obtained a 
few years ago in Europe, with (a) aggressive evictions, (b) occupation of nests, 
and (c) emptying of native bee nests, including Osmia bicornis, O. cornuta, 
and recently, Anthidium septemspinosum (Le Féon et al., 2018, 2021). In 2020, 
Geslin et al. conducted a study in urban parks of Marseille (France) to assess 
the impact of Msc on wild bees. They installed 96 bee hotels in 12 parks in the 
city and explored the relationship between the abundance of Msc and native 
bees emerging from bee hotels. First, they found that the most abundant bee 
nesting in bee hotels was Msc, with more than 40% of individuals. Second, 
they discovered a negative correlation between the presence of native bees 
and that of Msc within insect hotels, suggesting a negative impact of Msc on 
local native populations of wild bees. Two recent publications have provided 
new information on the impact of Msc on wild fauna. First, Lanner et al. (2020a) © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones 239
reported the killing of several Heriades spp. individuals, a French native species, 
by Msc, thereby documenting another direct impact of the alien bee species 
on native ones. Finally, Díaz et al. (2021) documented the occupation by Msc
of Osmia cornuta nests without entirely emptying the nests. This means that 
Msc females laid eggs close to the cavity entrance, blocking this entrance with 
mud and resin. Osmia cornuta is active in spring, unlike Msc, which is active 
during summer (from June to September in Europe). Emerging individuals of 
O. cornuta are therefore blocked by this resin, incapable of exiting the nest, and 
may ultimately die from starvation or exhaustion.
Taken together, these findings show that Msc could have a deleterious 
impact on local wild bee populations (Fig. 8). However, the magnitude of 
these impacts remains poorly understood. For now, it does not appear easy 
to determine whether Msc could profoundly modify the structure of local 
bee populations, for example, by causing local extinctions of some species. 
The extent to which Msc disrupts native pollinators remains to be carefully 
evaluated, and future research will help us explore this question.
3.4 Other impacts
To date, there has been no documentation of other potential impacts of Msc
on ecosystems or human economy and infrastructures. As stated earlier, Msc
Figure 8 Megachile sculpturalis female emptying the nest of a female of Anthidium sp.

appears to preferentially forage for pollen from alien plant species, potentially 
helping their spread. However, there is currently no evidence for such an effect. 
In addition, Díaz et al. (2021) showed that Msc could be affected by common, 
widespread generalist macro parasites without a substantial effect on the 
emerging success of Msc. At this stage, it appears difficult to determine whether 
Msc could reinforce parasite populations which could in turn affect native wild 
bees, and this remains to be explored. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, 
there is no reported effect of Msc on human economy and infrastructures. Msc
is an opportunistic species that nests in pre-existing cavities and does not dig 
holes in wood by itself, reducing its potential impact on infrastructure.
Regarding the economy, a single example has been reported in the 
literature regarding the potential positive impact of Msc on agriculture: the 
pollination of Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.: Fabaceae) in Florida (Hall and 
Avila, 2016). Msc has been associated with a higher seed set for this cover 
crop, which contributes to soil nitrogen enhancement (Hall and Avila, 2016). 
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that C. juncea is an alien plant in the US. 
Moreover, this species is classified as invasive in some Pacific islands (see Hall 
and Avila, 2016); therefore, it is difficult to classify the interaction between Msc
and C. juncea as positive or negative.
4 Conclusion
In this chapter, we have presented an overview of the known impacts of 
alien bees on native ones. As emphasised in the introduction, we voluntarily 
excluded the other known impacts of alien bees on native ecosystems, such as 
the disruption of native plant–pollinator networks, the population enhancement 
of alien plants (invasional meltdown), or the impact on crop production (except 
for the case study, for a comprehensive review on this subject see Aizen et al., 
2020). As shown here, the potential effects exerted by alien bees on native 
bees are important and could, in extreme cases, be responsible for dramatic 
population losses of native bees (the case of Bombus dahlbomii in South 
America; see above). To date, 80 bee species have been recorded outside their 
native ranges (Russo, 2016). The different cases we exposed in this chapter are 
among the most iconic, with the strongest recorded negative impacts. Overall, 
however, the global impact of alien bees on native bees and ecosystems is 
largely unknown. Very few cases of introductions have been carefully studied, 
and for some of the recorded alien bees, little is known regarding their impacts 
on native bees and ecosystems. The case of Msc is an exception, being one of 
the single invasions that is relatively well documented (as is the case of Bombus 
terrestris in South America, Japan, and Tasmania).
Hence, we need to amplify our efforts to document new introductions, 
the geographic spread of alien bees, and their impacts. The number of new © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones 241
introductions is not expected to drop in the coming years (Seebens et al., 
2017), and we need to anticipate the potentially dramatic consequences 
of these introductions to avoid them. For example, in 2018, Bortolotti et al. 
reported the presence of a second alien bee species in continental Europe, 
Megachile disjunctiformis. This species resembles Msc morphologically 
(Fig. 9) and has a similar native geographical repartition. To date, M. 
disjunctiformis has only been detected in Italy and has not yet extended its 
geographical range to neighbouring countries. However, we believe that 
this is likely to occur soon. We have little information about the ecology of 
this new alien species, and the consequences of its introduction should be 
closely observed in the future.
As stated earlier, the introduction of a new bee species in an ecosystem 
is often disregarded because of its role in the pollination of plants. However, 
we should change the way we perceive bee introductions. Like any other 
introduced species, alien bees can become invasive and affect native pollinators 
and ecosystem functioning. Introducing a new species into an environment is 
never a zero-sum game, and such practices must be abolished. Instead, native 
ecosystems should be preserved, and native bees allowed to thrive. Friendly 
practices favouring bees, such as the exclusion of pesticides, planting native 
flowers, and reduced mowing frequency (see Kawahara et al., 2021), should 
be encouraged. To prevent new invasions, biosecurity between countries must 
be reinforced and cross-border legal instruments homogenised (Diagne et al., 
2021; Aizen et al., 2019; see Section 5).

5 Future trends in research
In this section, we have identified five major gaps that should be addressed in 
future research:
1 Even if some new data have been accumulated since, the first simple 
recommendation we can provide is to amplify research efforts on alien 
bees. We advocate for a new review of bees introduced worldwide 6 
years after the one of Russo (2016). The cases of M. disjunctiformis in 
Italy (Bortolotti et al., 2018) or Xylocopa pubescens in the Canary Islands 
(Ruiz et al., 2020) are examples of introductions that occurred after the 
review of Russo (2016).
2 We should estimate the ecological impacts of alien bees more accurately, 
be they positive or negative. For example, Russo (2016) determined 
that 11 out of 80 species could positively affect native ecosystems, 
but no review on these effects exists to date. Of course, fieldwork and 
experiments to estimate impacts are costly (Goulson, 2003), but they 
provide valuable information for estimating impacts (e.g. see Díaz et al., 
2021; Geslin et al., 2020).
3 We need to estimate the agronomic costs of alien bees. In their recent 
review, Aizen et  al. (2020) provided convincing examples of the 
deleterious impacts of alien bees on agroecosystems. For example, the 
invasion of Bombus terrestris in Argentina affected the production of 
raspberries (Sáez et al., 2014, 2017, 2018). One underlying mechanism 
is the over-visitation of raspberry flowers by Bombus terrestris, leading 
to flower damage, such as style breakage (see Badano and Vergara, 
2011 for an example on coffee plantations).
4 The economic cost associated with alien bees must be estimated. In 
addition to the costs related to agricultural production, it has been 
suggested that some wood-nesting bees can potentially represent 
a problem for wooden structures as nest excavation may generate 
structural weakness in lumber (Rust et al., 2004). In their recent review 
on the global economic costs of invasive species, Diagne et al. (2021) 
estimated a mean annual cost of invasive invertebrates of US$ 8.7 
billion from 1970 to 2017. However, this review also highlights the 
critical need for more research on the economic costs of invasive 
insects.
5 If possible, we should provide stakeholders with management 
techniques to avoid the spread of alien bees. For example, Geslin et al. 
(2020) showed that Megachile sculpturalis rarely nests in bamboo with 
a hole diameter < 8 mm. This observation could help land managers 
install and build insect hotels to avoid the nesting of Msc.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

6 How to improve biosecurity
Among the new pathways of invasions, the increase of commercial offers for 
the public of both managed and wild bees is of great concern (Geslin et al., 
2017). Over the past 30 years, we have seen an exponential development 
of pollination supplementation practices in order to fight against pollinator 
declines and to compensate the limitation of pollination service delivered to 
entomophilous crops and ornamental species which may limit their yields. 
Since the 1970s, this has led to the first wave of global trade in social bees 
and bumblebees, initially for greenhouse use. As we have previously seen in 
this chapter, many reports of escapes of these imported bees into the wild 
have occurred. More recently, the second wave of the commercial trade of 
wild bees is emerging. In Europe or in North America, various commercial 
companies are selling wild solitary bees to promote better pollination service 
in gardens and field crops, arguing that these bees offer a much greater 
pollination service than domesticated social bees. Several mason bees and 
leaf-cutting bees have been selected for commercial purposes according to 
their nesting habits in cavities, offering an easy way to ship living cocoons in 
bamboo twigs. However, in the US and Canada, this may also promote the 
spread of some alien bees (e.g. Osmia cornifrons). These new commercial 
practices bring new pathways for alien pollinators to spread as the business 
may be done worldwide. For example, by June 2021, a wild bee package 
shipped from France to Seattle (US) was intercepted in New Caledonia by 
biosecurity services. Inside the package, we found bamboo twigs containing 
23 lived cocoons of Osmia bicornis and two recently emerged females (H. 
Jourdan, pers. obs.). This illustrates the tremendous risk of moving large 
numbers of alien pollinators to a wide range of regions without any biosecurity 
rules implemented.
Beyond this specific pollinator trade, there are still other pathways for the 
involuntary spread of alien pollinators associated with global trade. The rule 
that the more the volume of traded commodities increases between distant 
countries, the more the biosecurity risk increases for alien arrivals (Hulme, 
2009), is also valid for pollinators. Mason bees (including resin bees and leaf￾cutting bees) and carpenter bees (including hollow stem nesting species) 
appear more likely to be propagated by human trade.
To deal with these new threats, enforcement of biosecurity regulations 
and practices against the transfer or arrival of alien bees is urgently needed. 
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
standards, biosecurity is defined as ‘a strategic and integrated approach that 
encompasses the policy and regulatory frameworks (including instruments 
and activities) for analysing and managing relevant risks to human, animal and 
plant life and health, and associated risks to the environment’. It appears critical 244 Assessing the impact of alien bees on native ones

in the context of biological invasions (Hulme, 2010). Islands are particularly 
at risk and deserve special attention (Cox and Elmqvist, 2000; Moore et al., 
2010). But since the late 1980s, most of the biosecurity efforts have focused on 
preventing the spread of parasites and pathogens of managed bees and not 
alien bees in general.
In recent decades, Australia has appeared as a good example of biosecurity 
measures enforced to protect native pollinators. Even if it was established 
mostly for protecting the bee industry with highly enforced regulation and 
surveillance against the introduction of Varroa destructor, tracheal mites with 
European (Apis melifera) or Asian (Apis cerana) beehives, it is also focusing 
on some bee diseases to avoid possible spillover between managed bees 
and wild bees (Heersink et al., 2016; Robert et al., 2017; Dalmon et al., 2021). 
These biosecurity efforts rely on a national network of sentinel beehives. Such a 
sentinel coordinated approach is also applied to the larger Pacific region (New 
Zealand – despite Varroa installation – New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and to 
a lesser extent Fiji).
Another alternative solution to reduce the unfortunate trade of alien 
pollinators relies on the valuing and promotion of local wild pollinators for 
pollination effectiveness. This implies the conservation and restoration of 
‘green infrastructures’ across landscapes that enhance wild bee populations. In 
Australia, native stingless bees are promoted in a commercial way to enhance 
pollination service, and troubles in Tasmania linked to the European Bumblebee 
(Bombus terrestris) have led to research for local alternative pollinators. Thus, 
native Amegilla spp. were identified as highly efficient pollinators in gardens, 
especially for Solanaceae (McQuillan and Hingston, 1999; Hogendoorn 
et al., 2000, 2007). But without awareness of the public, a new biosecurity 
concern may develop, as people may deliberately introduce Amegilla spp. 
into neighbouring oceanian territories, mostly archipelagos, for agricultural 
purposes. This has been suspected of Amegilla pulchra in Fiji, French Polynesia, 
and New Caledonia (Groom et al., 2017; Zakardjian et al., 2020). However, once 
introduced, Amegilla spp. may not limit their foraging to valuable crop species 
and are likely to visit alien plants. If those alien plants are usually poorly visited 
by native pollinators, the arrival of alien bees such as Amegilla spp. could result 
in the spread of those plant species.
Finally, there is an emerging corpus of methodology and theory to 
better implement efficient biosecurity measures in a changing world 
(climate change and global trade), especially urgently needed on islands, 
which could be applied to pollinators (Moore et al., 2010; Aizen et al., 2019; 
Proesmans et al., 2021). As pointed out by Hulme (2015), pathways for alien 
species introductions fall into six broad classes: deliberate release; escape 
from captivity; contamination of a commodity; stowaway on a transport © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

vector; via an infrastructure corridor (without which spread would not be 
possible) or unaided from already invaded regions. Each of them should 
be examined carefully in the context of alien pollinators spread, resulting 
in enforcement of regulation policies and ad hoc surveillance to prevent 
further biological invasions. More specifically, in the context of safeguarding 
pollination services, ten general rules have already been promoted as 
guidelines to improve governmental regulation, including an emphasis 
on the regulation of movement of managed pollinators and development 
of long-term monitoring of pollinators and pollination (Dicks et al., 2016). 
However, movement regulation should be extended to the wild bee trade 
and closest links should be developed with scientific research for robust 
long-term monitoring of pollinators and pollination at a global scale across 
a variety of landscapes. Hulme (2020) also promotes a ‘one biosecurity 
approach‘ relying on multidisciplinary input from ecology, social sciences, 
and economics. Such a global biosecurity approach should be promoted 
for pollination service, which is critical to ecosystem’s maintenance and 
human well-being in our changing world (Hulme, 2020; Proesmans et al., 
2021).

1 Introduction
The world’s biomes (temperate and tropical forests, deserts, tundra, boreal 
forests, grasslands and savannas), and the many local ecosystems and habitats 
they contain, are rapidly losing biodiversity. This has been termed the sixth 
mass extinction during the Holocene epoch (sometimes referred to as the 
Anthropocene) due to the results of planet-wide human activity. Ongoing 
extinction rates for various species are estimated to be about 100 times greater 
than background extinction rates during the past million years or so (Pimm 
et al., 2014).
Especially alarming, due to many keystone species involved and the 
ecosystem services they provide, are losses of invertebrates. These include 
pollinators of both wild plants and about 1400 species of crop plants grown 
within agricultural ecosystems (Roubik, 2018; Wagner et al., 2021). The majority 
of the world’s approximately 350000 flowering plant species (angiosperms) 
are engaged in largely mutualistic relationships with animal pollinators. 
Estimates suggest that 82% of angiosperm species are pollinated by insects 
(mostly bees), while 6% are pollinated by vertebrates (birds, bats and non￾flying mammals) and about 12% are pollinated by wind dispersal (Winfree, 
2008; Winfree et al., 2008, 2011; Ollerton et al., 2011; Aslan et al., 2013). A new

meta-analysis of 1174 angiosperm species indicates that, without pollinators, 
one-third of flowering plant species would produce no seeds, while about half 
would suffer a drastic and unsustainable 80% reduction in fertility (Rodger et al., 
2021). Pollinating animals are thus essential for the maintenance of healthy 
flowering plant communities and the myriad species that depend upon plants 
for food, reproduction and shelter.
Factors such as climate change, deforestation, desertification, pollution, 
pesticide use, invasive species, habitat modification and loss have all 
contributed to the recent dramatic losses of insect, bird, bat and other 
mammalian pollinators (Potts et al., 2010). A review of over 70 studies of insect 
decline suggests widespread insect losses (Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 
2019). Since humans are dependent upon insect-pollinated crops for around 
one-third of their diets, this is a crucial issue for all of us. Many global pollinator 
initiatives have called for immediate action to better understand and address 
these alarming declines (Buchmann and Ascher, 2005; Harvey et al., 2020; 
Marselle et al., 2020).
2 Bees as pollinators
There are 20000 bee species worldwide, the majority of which are pollinators 
(Danforth et al., 2019). Eusocial bees live in populous colonies, each with 
a reproductive queen, a small number of drones (males) and many sterile 
female workers. Eusociality can be found in many species in the family Apidae 
(honeybees, bumblebees, carpenter bees and stingless bees) and the family 
Halictidae (sweat bees). Among eusocial bees, the western honeybee (Apis 
mellifera) is the most widely managed pollinator species used globally to 
improve crop yields (Whitfield et al., 2006; Klein et al., 2007). Commercialized 
bumblebees (e.g. Bombus terrestris and B. impatiens) are employed in the 
greenhouse production of fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, strawberries 
and cucurbits (Velthuis and van Doorn, 2006). While wild honeybees nest 
above ground (e.g. in hollow tress), bumblebee species vary, with some nesting 
belowground, e.g. in ditch banks, hillsides or old mammal burrows such as 
mouse nests, while others nest above ground, e.g. in grasses or trees (Fussell 
and Corbet, 1992a). A UK survey found that bumblebee nest densities were 
highest in gardens (36 nests/ha), lower in countryside habitats (fence lines, 
hedgerows and woodland ecotones (edges)) (20–37 nests/ha) and lowest in 
woodlands and grassland areas (11–15 nests/ha) (Osborne et al., 2007).
However, in contrast to better-known eusocial species such as honeybees, 
over 90% of bee species are solitary. Among solitary bees, all females are 
reproductive, building their own nests and foraging for floral resources for 
their offspring without the help of other individuals (Danforth et al., 2019). 
Commonly observed solitary genera in the USA include leaf-cutter (Megachile), © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators 261
mason (Osmia), squash (Eucera), metallic green sweat (Agapostemon), 
Lasioglossum spp. and small carpenter bees (Ceratina), among others. Nest 
sites used by solitary bees include holes, burrows or tunnels in the soil, hollow 
plant stalks and gaps in wood or mortar structures such as walls (Danforth et al., 
2019). Solitary bee species often provide pollination services in specialty crop 
production (e.g. for alfalfa seed, pumpkins, tomato, eggplant and blueberries). 
The leaf-cutter bee (Megachile rotunda) is used for pollination in alfalfa and 
clover seed production as well as blueberry production, while mason bees 
(Osmia spp.) are managed for a variety of orchard crops, including almonds and 
cherries (Delaplane and Mayer, 2000). The alkali bee (Nomia melanderi) is used 
to pollinate alfalfa for seed production (Cane, 2008a,b). Squash bees (Eucera 
pruinosa) are important pollinators of cucurbit crops, especially pumpkin, 
squash and watermelon (Willis Chan and Raine, 2021). Alkali and squash bees 
are unusual among solitary bee species in that they can form dense nesting 
aggregations with thousands of individual nests in close proximity to each 
other and to crops and some solitary bees locate their nests within cropping 
areas (e.g. squash bees and Dieunomia triangulifera) (Minckley et al., 1994; 
Willis Chan and Raine, 2021). In addition to pollination, solitary bees perform 
other ecosystem services such as soil bioturbation and water infiltration and 
nutrient cycling and also serve as food for species such as insect predators, 
spiders, birds, lizards and mammals (Christmann, 2020).
It is generally recognized that pollination and other ecosystem services 
are optimized by promoting a diverse range of bee species. For pollination￾dependent crops, wild bees can complement services provided by managed 
pollinators, improving production and yield (Morandin and Winston, 2005; 
Greenleaf and Kremen, 2006; Winfree et al., 2007; Garibaldi et al., 2013; Mallinger 
et al., 2019; Nicholson et al., 2019). Promoting a diverse assemblage of wild 
pollinators serves the dual benefit of preserving biodiversity and increasing the 
efficiency of overall pollinator services (Burkle et al., 2017; Christmann, 2022).
However, the wide range of nesting habits and habitats used by bees can 
complicate attempts at habitat conservation or restoration, e.g. in reestablishing 
lost populations of wild ground-nesting solitary bees. There have been 
examples of moving colonies of bumblebees or highly social stingless bees 
near or within crops to promote pollination (Button and Elle, 2014). However, 
these are temporary measures designed to provide pollinators only while 
crops are blooming. These social bee domiciles are removed following the 
bloom of the crop and are not intended to conserve or restore populations 
of bees that formerly lived in the area. The example and case history of the 
USA alkali bee industry are examined as one success story for the active/
managed reintroduction of a native bee to its former rangelands, although as a 
pollinator of an introduced highly valuable crop, alfalfa, which originated in the 
Mediterranean basin.262 The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators

3 Challenges in habitat restoration
Attempts at habitat restoration must consider the range of threats facing bee 
species. Habitat loss due to urban development or agricultural intensification has 
frequently been highlighted as a leading cause of bee species decline (Wilcove 
et al., 1998; Venter et al., 2006). One meta-analysis found that fragmentation 
and outright loss of habitat negatively affected both species richness and the 
overall abundance of wild bees (Winfree et al., 2009). One relatively neglected 
aspect of habitat loss is the impact of roads and highways (Bennett, 1991). By 
2019, the highway network in the USA had a total length of about 4.2 million 
miles. Such road networks kill millions of insects, including bees, every year 
(Muñoz et al., 2014; Moller, 2019). Roads have other negative effects such as 
pollution from traffic as well as acting as barriers to the movement of bees and 
other species (Forman, 2003).
However, it is important to note that not all habitat changes are detrimental. 
It has been shown that native solitary bee populations can survive in gardens, 
parks and other urban settings (Hall et al., 2017). In Tucson (in the US state 
of Arizona), native bee visitors were studied at urban sites colonized by the 
creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). Perennial creosote bushes bloom during 
both the spring and summer and are a prolific floral host for about 125 species 
of native bees, occurring as habitat islands as small as one hectare. Even the 
smallest patches of creosote bushes supported healthy populations of native 
ground-nesting desert bees (Cane et al., 2005, 2006).
Research suggests that wild bee density can be affected by tillage, with 
farms practicing no-till techniques having significantly higher populations of 
ground-nesting bees (Schuler et al., 2005). It has also been suggested that 
agricultural activities such as tilling and grazing may have a limited impact on 
some ground-nesting bee species (Winfree et al., 2008). Tilling, for example, 
may remove stems used by cavity-nesting bees or non-crop weeds or native 
plants that provide pollen and nectar sources. However, while tillage may 
reduce belowground brood cells for many bees, deeper-nesting species may 
not be affected and some species (i.e. squash bees) may prefer to nest in tilled 
soil on farms (Ullmann et al., 2016).
Invasive species also impact the availability of nesting sites and flowering 
plants for pollen and nectar. Weedy plants can ‘smother’ native and agricultural 
habitats with dense mixed or unifloral stands of non-native flowering plants, 
obstructing the ability of native vegetation to flower and thrive. Examples 
from the USA include yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis) in southern 
and central California (also considered a prime honey source by beekeepers), 
various knapweeds including C. stoebe and leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula). 
Invasive grasses include downy brome or cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and 
foxtail buffalo grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), the latter presenting an ever-increasing © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators 263
problem in Arizona, USA and Mexico (Di Tomaso, 2000; Lyons et al., 2017). 
Invasive grasses such as foxtail buffalo grass (which forms dense mats) can also 
increase the risk of wildfires in arid regions such as the Sonoran Desert in Arizona 
(Wilder et al., 2021). Effects on ground-nesting bees of wildfires are mixed: bee 
brood cells less than 5 cm deep are at high mortality risk from fires, those from 
5 cm to 10 cm deep are at low risk and those bees nesting below 10 cm are 
essentially at no risk from fires passing overhead (Cane and Neff, 2011).
There are about 23 species of alien bees that have been accidentally or 
purposefully introduced into the USA (Ascher, 2001; Cane, 2003; Sheffield 
et al., 2013). Introduced bees in the USA include species of Andrena, 
Anthidium, Chelostoma, Hoplitis, Hylaeus and especially Megachile (leaf-cutter 
bees). Most accidentally introduced bees in the USA are stem-nesting bees 
(Hylaeinae, Megachilidae and Xylocopinae), probably introduced via imported 
plant materials. Although introduced bees only make up about 0.5% of the 
North American bee fauna (Ascher, 2001), they can cause significant harm. If 
they become established, introduced non-native bees can compete with native 
bees (Cane, 2003). An example is the introduced giant resin bee (Megachile 
sculpturalis) which competes with the eastern carpenter bee (Xylocopa virginica) 
in the Eastern United States for nesting sites and floral resources (Laport and 
Minckley, 2012). Honeybees may also compete with native bees and other 
pollinators for limited floral resources and nesting sites (Goulson, 2003; Paini, 
2004). Invasive species have also been found to cause mating disruption in 
some anthidiine solitary bees in the Eastern United States (Stout and Morales, 
2009). Additionally, there are native cuckoo (cleptoparasitic) bees (genera 
including Nomada and Triepeolus) that lay their eggs in the nests of other 
bees, with their larvae then consuming the host eggs or larvae and the food 
meant for the host larvae (Danforth et al., 2019). Other common parasites of 
many ground-nesting bees are rhipiphorid beetles, shiny black blister beetles 
(Meloidae) and velvet ants (wingless female wasps in the family Mutillidae).
Both native and introduced parasitic organisms create further problems for 
the health and well-being of native bees. Bees are routinely attacked by at least 
124 species of entomophagous fungi (Batra, 1984; Omuse et al., 2021), at least 
four kinds of nematodes (Quinn, pers. comm.), many bacteria and viruses, at 
least three species of parasitic mites on honeybees and many more on solitary 
bees (Sammatraro et al., 2000). Common diseases of social and some solitary 
bees include chalkbrood (Ascosphaera apis), American foulbrood (Paenibacillus 
larvae) and sacbrood virus. Many of the disease organisms associated with 
solitary ground-nesting bees have not yet been identified. A particular threat is 
pathogen spillover. Honeybees and commercialized bumblebees can harbor 
microorganisms and diseases, which then may infect other wild bees (Colla 
and Packer, 2008; Colla et al., 2005). This occurs when microbial pathogens 
(especially Nosema bombi and Crithidia) infecting honey and commercialized 264 The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators

bumblebees are deposited on flowers by the bees (Cordes et al., 2011; Murray 
et al., 2013). These pathogens can easily infect female and male solitary bees 
as well as wild bumblebees visiting these blooms (Colla and Packer, 2008; 
Otterstatter and Thomson, 2008; Cameron et al., 2011; Szabo et al., 2012). This 
infection route has been linked to the demise of several US bumblebee species 
(e.g. Bombus affinis, B. terricola, B. pennsylvanicus and possibly B. occidentalis
and B. franklini) (Szabo et al., 2012). It is also important to note that there are 
many bacteria, archaea and yeasts that inhabit the guts of bee adults and larvae 
(Danforth et al., 2019). Many now appear to be mutualists which promote 
digestion and combat coinhabiting pathogenic microbes, especially in solitary 
bees (Dharampal et al., 2019).
Changes in global temperature and precipitation are likely to have drastic 
effects on bees, their metamorphosis, sociality, emergence and interactions 
with other bees and other species (Radmacher and Strohm, 2010; Davison 
and Field, 2018; Bartomeus et al., 2011; Straka et al., 2014). Most studies 
examining the effects of climate change on bees have been done in trap 
nest blocks or laboratory colonies with few direct measurements in nature for 
ground-nesting bees (Forrest and Chisholm, 2017; Vinchesi et al., 2013). Many 
researchers have suggested that the early arrival of spring, which affects the 
blooming phenology of plants, is already causing a mismatch between when 
flowers bloom and when bees, especially specialist bees, emerge (Forrest and 
Chisholm, 2017). Increases in air temperature and changes in winter conditions 
will affect soil temperatures and the flowering of plants that provide bee food 
and nesting materials (Anderson and Harmon-Threat, 2016). A recent study 
of 66 bumblebee (Bombus) species across the UK and North America, which 
compared the period 1901–1974 with the period 2000–2014, concluded that 
bumblebee species richness declined in areas particularly affected by climate 
change (Soroye et al., 2020). They suggest that climate change has been the 
cause of greater declines of European bumblebee species than was previously 
assumed.
However, there is evidence that certain ground-nesting bees may be 
resilient to some effects of climate change. Some bee species have been found 
to be resilient to hurricanes (Cane, 1997) and may survive complete inundation 
of nesting sites (Stephen, 1966; Visscher et al., 1994), fires (Cane and Neff, 2011) 
and drought conditions (Minckley et al., 2013). To date, extreme and prolonged 
cold is one factor that has received limited study. Warming environments in 
northern regions may encourage range expansions and concomitant increasing 
species richness (Deutsch et al., 2008; Sirois-Delisle and Kerr, 2018). It has been 
found that ground-nesting bees typically nest at depths of 9 cm to 23 cm (Cane 
and Neff, 2011; Harmon-Threatt, 2020). One way bees have adapted to adverse 
climatic conditions (e.g. drought) is to remain underground and in diapause, in 
one case for up to 10 years (Torchio, 1976). Some ground-nesting bee species © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

are able to tolerate high temperatures (40°C) at the depths at which they nest 
(Visscher and Danforth, 1993).
4 Assessing the effectiveness of habitat restoration
There are a range of approaches to foraging habitat restoration that may benefit 
wild bee populations. These include the use of burning and grazing to improve 
floral diversity in grasslands, planting of hedgerows, creating field margins as 
well as the use of mowing, weeding of invasive species and reseeding to create 
more ecologically diverse and rich landscapes. Some studies have highlighted 
how quickly bee populations can recolonize restored sites, though factors such 
as proximity to existing wild bee communities are important to recolonization 
success (Exeler et al., 2009; Richards et al., 2011; Kutby, 2013).
A study by Winfree (2010) found that agri-environmental restoration 
projects in the European Union using such techniques significantly benefitted 
bee communities in both species richness and abundance compared with 
conventionally cultivated sites. However, the author also highlighted the range 
of challenges in delivering successful outcomes for wild bee populations. These 
included gaps in our understanding of the complex range of wild bee needs, 
a corresponding focus of many projects on restoring floral resources (often 
with limited information on what floral resources might be appropriate) with 
less focus on nesting sites, challenges in establishing appropriate benchmarks 
to measure restoration outcomes, issues in accurately measuring changes in 
bee numbers and behaviors in response to changes in management, limited 
monitoring of the long-term impacts of some projects as well as challenges in 
isolating what factors in a particular restoration project had the greatest impact. 
The challenges of the effective study of wild bee populations and of assessing 
the effectiveness of restoration projects have been highlighted by Colla et al. 
(2012) and Menz et al. (2011).
A more recent meta-analysis has examined the impact of habitat 
enhancement in agricultural settings for wild bee populations (Tonietto 
and Larkin, 2018). The authors analyzed 28 studies across 11 habitat types 
and 7 restoration techniques. Overall, they also found strong evidence that 
ecological restoration projects significantly advanced wild bee conservation 
in improving native bee species richness and abundance across habitat 
types. However, among other challenges, they also highlighted a continued 
focus of restoration projects on enhancing floral resources to improve overall 
biodiversity, with few studies considering wild bees specifically or issues such 
as habitat (nesting site) requirements for ground- or cavity-nesting bees.
Similar results have been obtained when looking at the restoration of 
particular habitat types such as prairie ecosystems. A study of restored tallgrass 
prairie sites in Ontario (Canada) found they supported twice as many bee 266 The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators

species and three times more bees than unrestored prairies, an improvement 
the authors associated with a wider diversity of floral resources (Paterson 
et al., 2019). Another study of eight restored prairie sites in Minnesota (USA) 
also found they provided sufficient pollen resources to maintain wild bee 
populations despite the continued use of intensive cultivation in adjacent fields 
(Ritchie et al., 2020). A study of restored grassland–wetland complexes in North 
American prairies also found that bee diversity increased rapidly following 
restoration compared to reference sites, with bee numbers and diversity of 
species linked to floral species composition (Purvis et al., 2020). However, a 
recent study of 14 restored tallgrass prairie sites across North America found 
that wild bees responded best to soil disturbance by grazing bison and the 
overall amount of prairie and forest across the landscape rather than to the 
greater availability of local floral resources in restored sites (Griffin et al., 2020). 
They also found a high sensitivity of bees to agricultural land use (adjacent row￾crop agriculture).
One approach to ecological restoration in North America and particularly 
in Europe has been to reverse the destruction of hedgerows (a centuries￾old feature in many European rural landscapes) resulting from agricultural 
intensification, a loss which has been linked to pollinator decline (Park, 1988; 
Osborne et al., 1991). Hedgerows provide safe resting and feeding areas 
for numerous species of insects and vertebrate wildlife, including wild bees 
(Kremen et al., 2018; Bentrup et al., 2019). Perennial plants in the UK hedgerows 
that are important for bees include hawthorn (Crataegus), brambles (Rubus) and 
lime (Tilia). As a result, there has been a range of initiatives to restore or replant 
hedgerows to create more biodiverse agricultural landscapes (Hopwood, 
2013; Garratt et al., 2017; Kremen and Merenlender, 2018).
Recently, land managers, state and federal agencies in the United States 
have expressed an interest in monitoring the effects of electrical transmission 
line rights of way on honey bee and unmanaged native bees and other 
pollinators. A review of these concerns and studies is found here (see Wojcik 
and Buchmann, 2012).
Analyzing the results of over 300 surveys of 15 Californian sites across an 
8-year period, M’Gonigle et  al. (2015) concluded that hedgerow restoration 
promoted enhanced colonization and persistence of wild bee populations 
compared to unrestored field edges. Another study of Californian hedgerows 
by Morandin and Kremen (2013) found that they played a significant role in 
promoting less common native bee species, confirmed by Ponisio et al. (2016), 
who highlighted the role of hedgerows in promoting bee species diversity. 
Research by Kremen et al. (2018) found that pollinator numbers and species 
diversity responded most to the growth in floral diversity as hedgerows matured 
and that the surrounding natural habitat also played a key role in promoting 
pollinators. However, a recent study of field margins and hedgerows in Canada © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators 267
by Clausen et  al. (2022) concluded that, overall, grass margins contributed 
more to wild bee abundance and diversity than remnant or planted hedgerows, 
findings supported by other European studies (e.g. Pywell at al., 2005, 
2012; Haaland et al., 2011). A study of riparian forest restoration projects by 
Williams (2010) also found that they promoted diverse and abundant wild bee 
communities, though community structure differed compared to remnant sites.
One potential challenge that potentially limits the effectiveness of 
restoration projects is the selection of the right floral and other resources for 
particular wild bee species. Bees need flowering plants to survive. Even the 
approximately 10% of bees that are cleptoparasites ultimately depend upon the 
nutrients ingested by the hosts on which they depend. Angiosperms provide 
pollen, nectar, floral oils and other nutritive substances. Certain bee species 
(leaf-cutter bees, orchid bees and stingless bees) also require leaves, saps, 
resins and volatiles from other plants as nest-building materials or precursors 
for mating attractant blends. Long-lived bee colonies or individuals need a 
mixed array of flowering plants on a daily and seasonal basis. This is especially 
true for honeybees (Apis), bumblebees (Bombus), stingless bees (Melipona, 
Trigona and other genera) and carpenter bees (Xylocopa) (Lawson et al., 2021). 
Consuming a mixed pollen diet offsets unfavorable properties of any one 
pollen source including low protein content or outright toxicity (Eckhart et al., 
2014). Restoration ecologists, conservationists and gardeners agree that using 
a diversity of different annuals and perennials with overlapping bloom times 
during the season is beneficial to providing a regular and nutritious food supply 
(Majewska and Altizer, 2020). Many solitary bee species are specialist foragers, 
preferring to collect pollen from a narrow group of plants (Cane and Sipes, 
2006; Wright, 2018; Fowler and Droege, 2020; Fowler, 2020a,b). Restoring 
habitat for these species requires planting specific plants that meet the needs 
of their pollen specialization. For example, the squash bees only collect pollen 
from wild or cultivated plants in the genus Cucurbita, and between 25% and 
35% of bee species in the USA are pollen specialists, many on species of 
goldenrod (Asteraceae) (Fowler and Droege, 2020; Fowler, 2020a,b).
Selecting the right plants for a garden or large-scale restorative planting 
depends upon a number of factors (Menz et al., 2011). Firstly, in garden 
and urban landscapes, it is important to select and use native plants that 
are adapted to local edaphic and climatic conditions so that less watering, 
fertilization and maintenance are required. Secondly, it is important to choose 
heirloom varieties and non-hybridized flowers. This is because the hybrids of 
many flowers have been selected by plant breeders to appeal to human visual 
sensibilities or to reduce messiness in cut flowers (i.e. pollenless sunflowers) 
rather than pollinator dietary and other requirements. Pollinator attractiveness 
tests for garden flower varieties have been conducted in the UK and elsewhere 
(Corbet et al., 1984).268 The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators

The importance of the correct selection can be seen in the activities of 
the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) whose responsibilities include 
the planting of seed mixes to control erosion and restore floristic diversity to 
rangelands after over-grazing or fires. One such area is the American sagebrush 
steppe which stretches across the Great Basin and adjoining region of the US 
Intermountain West, covering much of Nevada, Utah and Oregon, and which 
is at increased risk of wildfires due to climate change. The bulk seed purchases 
made by the BLM have included non-native Eurasian species together with 
species such as western yarrow (Achillea millefolium) and Lewis’ flax (Linum 
lewisii), which do not provide ideal resources for wild bees. Recognizing this 
problem, the White House issued a National Pollinator Health Strategy in 
2015 which required federal land management agencies to adapt programs to 
target the protection of managed honey and native bee populations.
In response to the new strategy, the BLM conducted walking scans of 
native bees, and their densities, across 219 locations together with surveying 
17 wildflower species within the Intermountain West to determine the most 
important bee plants that should be used for reseeding (Cane and Love, 2016). 
Over 35 000 plants were sampled, and 3500 bees were collected in this study. 
Few bees were observed on the traditionally used yarrow and flax. Instead, 
most bees were observed on and collected from plants including Phacelia, 
Lomatium, Sphaeralcea, Balsamorhiza and Dalea (Cane and Love, 2016). These 
findings are being used to redesign seed mixes to better target and benefit 
wild bee populations.
5 Case studies
5.1 Case study: managing alkali bees (Nomia melanderi)
Fewer than a dozen species of bees are managed commercially as crop 
pollinators. These are honeybees (A. mellifera and A. cerana) typically for field 
crops and bumblebees (Bombus spp.) mainly for the pollination of greenhouse 
crops like tomatoes and strawberries. The alfalfa leaf-cutter bee (M. rotundata) 
is used for pollination of alfalfa (lucerne) in the USA and Canada. The only native 
US solitary bee that has been managed commercially for pollination services 
is the alkali bee (Nomia melanderi) (Cane, 2021). The alkali bee is native to 
the Pacific Northwest, especially within the intermountain basin regions of 
Washington and Oregon but extending into California’s Central Valley. The 
species is a gregarious ground-nesting solitary bee. Females nest in close 
proximity (hundreds per square meter). Each female digs and provisions her 
own nest.
In the 1940s, after noticing this species collecting pollen from alfalfa 
blossom more actively than other bees, some farmers began experimenting © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators 269
with locating bee-nesting beds in alkaline flats and then planting alfalfa crops 
adjacent to them for pollination (Stephen, 2003). Farmers have found that while 
yields using honeybees for pollination achieved seed yields of 200 kg/ha, use 
of alkali bees has increased seed yields to 1300 kg/ha or more (Olmstead and 
Wooten, 1987; Cane, 2021). In the Walla Walla region of Washington state, at 
least 17 million alkali bees are managed in dozens of artificially created nesting 
sites, the oldest established 60 years ago and the largest home to some 
5 million bees (Cane, 2008a).
The first commercial alkali nesting beds were long narrow beds dug 
about 1 m deep and lined with plastic. A layer of gravel was placed over the 
plastic, and then about a meter of silty-loam soil added. Plastic standpipes 
were inserted at intervals into the soil bed. A surface treatment of rock salt was 
added to cap the bee-nesting site. The salt draws water up by capillary action 
in a way that mimics the wild nesting sites of this halictid bee. Today subsurface 
drip irrigation tubing performs this role. New bee beds are ‘inoculated’ with 
brood cells (containing dormant pupae) from other artificial beds or natural 
nesting sites. Backhoes with metal attachments punch into the soil and remove 
cubes of soil containing brood cells. These are placed in cardboard inserts then 
carefully set into waiting holes. An operator can remove and transplant up to 
1000 bee cubes (Cane, 2021). Some growers use spiked rollers across beds to 
create starter nest holes which are adopted by nesting females (Cane, 2008b).
Surprisingly, given their dense nesting aggregations, alkali bees are not 
subject to parisitization by cleptoparasitic bees. Instead, they are predated by 
bee flies (Bombyliidae) along with meloid (blister) beetles and mutillid wasps. 
The greatest mortality can occur from spoiled pollen ball provisions of nectar 
and pollen upon which eggs are laid, with up to 32% of nest cells affected in 
this way (Batra et al., 1973). Forty-six species of fungi (including yeasts) have 
been isolated from alkali bee brood cells, though it is still not clear which are 
pathogenic, saprophytic or beneficial mutualists (Danforth et al., 2019).
Alkali bees are an unusual case of a ‘domesticated’ native solitary ground￾nesting bee used for agricultural pollination. No other ground-nesting bees 
anywhere in the world have been managed due to the difficulty of managing 
underground brood cells. Although alkali bees are not endangered and 
provide commercial crop pollination services, this example shows the potential 
for supporting other solitary, ground-nesting bee species once their nesting 
biology is better understood.
5.2 Case study: promoting stem- or cavity-nesting bees
About 10% of the nearly 4000 species of native bees in the USA are stem￾or cavity-nesting bees. Commonly observed genera include leaf-cutter 
(Megachile), mason (Osmia) and carpenter bees (Xylocopa and Ceratina). 270 The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators

Many practitioners have also advocated for installing drilled board or straw￾containing wooden boxes to attract and house nesting leaf-cutter and mason 
bees (Frankie et al., 1998; MacIvor and Packer, 2015).
These bees can be supported by providing nesting wood substrates such 
as leaving dead trees (snags) or uncut dead branches as potential nest sites. 
Dead trees and branches provide habitats for beetles, bees, birds and other 
wildlife. When the larvae of many beetle species chew through dead wood, 
they create galleries leading to the surface. Once beetles pupate and emerge, 
these empty tunnels provide nest sites for many megachilid bees since stem￾nesting species cannot excavate burrows of their own. These beetle burrow 
nests may be reused over many years by multiple generations of a diverse 
assemblage of bees in this beetle–bee ecosystem. Evidence from leaving 
dead specimens of Indian White Teak (Gmelina arborea) after teak logging 
in Costa Rica suggests their potential as a habitat for bees (Galbraith et al., 
2015). Research on cavity-nesting bee and wasp species in southern Amazonia 
looked at the effects of different types of forest regeneration (pastures, teak 
reforestation, fig and mixed native species, naturally regenerated secondary 
forest) compared to sites with intact primary forest (Araujo et al., 2020), 
concluding that the most ‘complex’ vegetation structure supported the most 
diverse bee and wasp communities.
Holes can also be drilled into dead trees, upright wooden fence posts, 
wooden outbuildings or small towers mimicking dead trees. These holes should 
be spaced about 10–20 cm apart and drilled to a depth of 5–10 cm if possible. 
To encourage the greatest diversity of twig-nesting bee genera and species, 
hole diameters should include holes from 2 mm up to 8 mm in diameter. Paper 
straw liners can also be added. However, a recent work by MacIvor and Packer 
(2015) in Ontario, Canada, has shown that artificial nests such as these may 
attract more wasps and exotic bee species than native bee species.
5.3 Case study: providing underground-nesting boxes for 
bumblebees
Globally, there are around 250 species of bumblebees (Bombus), with about 
a dozen species that have been reared within insectaries and used for the 
pollination of agricultural crops, especially tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers 
(Goulson, 2003, 2010; Kevan et al., 1990). They are especially valued for their 
ability to vibrate flowers with pored anthers, also known as buzz pollination 
(Buchmann, 1983: De Luca and Vallejo-Marin, 2013). Agricultural crops 
requiring buzz pollination include tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, blueberries, 
cranberries and kiwi fruit. Honeybees are sometimes used to pollinate 
blueberry or cranberry crops but are generally less effective than bumblebees 
(Buchmann, 1983; Cane and Payne, 1988; DeLuca and Vallejo-Marin, 2013).© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators 271
Bumblebees typically nest underground, especially in ditch banks or 
hillsides, in old mammal burrows, especially mouse nests (Fussell and Corbet, 
1992a,b). In areas where bee colonies are lacking, it is possible to encourage 
wild bumblebee queens to make their nests inside wood or plastic boxes 
provided for them at the edges of fields situated in ditch banks. Bumblebee 
boxes have been developed and tested in several countries (Lye et al., 2011). An 
early study developed polystyrene nesting boxes for four species of introduced 
bumblebees in New Zealand for crop pollination (Donovan and Wier, 1978). 
Over a period of 3 years, for 340 nest boxes placed, 84 (24.7%) were occupied 
by all four introduced bumblebee species (B. hortorum, B. uderatus, B. 
subterraneus and B. terrestris). Other initiatives have experienced low levels of 
occupancy. Since bumblebee species have declined drastically across the UK 
(Goulson et al., 2008; 2015), partly due to habitat loss from intensive farming, 
artificial nest boxes have been used to help reverse the decline. However, one 
study of underground Bombus boxes in garden settings found occupancy as 
low as 1.5% (Fussell and Corbet, 1992a). Another study found that only 23 of 
736 domiciles deployed (3.1%) were occupied by queens (Lye et al., 2011).
6 Conclusion
Bee species, especially ground-nesting ones, can vary in their resilience to 
human-caused and other disturbances. Deeper nesting species, for example, 
are relatively immune to the effects of wildfires, insulated by the soil above 
their brood cells, whereas cavity-nesting bees living at or with a few meters 
of the ground are at greater risk. Habitat loss and degradation are the most 
severe threat to native bee populations, followed by invasive plants and bee 
species. Parasites, diseases and predators take their toll but are generally at 
sufficiently low levels to allow local bee populations to be sustained. A major 
exception is pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bee species affecting 
five at-risk species of bumblebees within the USA and a similar suite of 
endangered bumblebee species in Great Britain and other European countries. 
Agrochemicals including insecticides and herbicides are an omnipresent threat 
to all bees. Systemic insecticides are especially dangerous because they are 
secreted in nectar used by bees. Bees that have ‘wax furniture’ (honeybees, 
stingless bees and bumblebees) are at risk of falling prey to something akin 
to sick building syndrome since these persistent toxic chemicals become 
incorporated into these waxes and can persist for years. Attention needs to 
be paid to invasive bees like the Giant Resin Bee, which competes for floral 
resources with many native bees and for nesting holes with native carpenter 
bees. Urbanization effects seem to have helped certain bee species (e.g. 
Megachile) by providing abundant holes and cracks in human structures along 
with floral resources available the year-round. Habitat islands within cities have, 272 The role of habitat conservation and restoration in protecting pollinators

for example, shown to be refugia for Sonoran Desert bee species that visit 
patches of creosote bush (Larrea) within the city limits of Tucson (in the state 
of Arizona, USA).
Habitat restoration for plant communities is at a more advanced stage than 
for the restoration of wild bee communities in all habitats. Some success has 
been achieved, but long-term studies and careful bee monitoring are needed 
to properly gauge the permanent effects of restoration programs for wild bee 
populations. Importantly, land managers and restoration ecologists should 
become familiar with the entirely of bees’ needs, not just flowers. In the case 
of solitary bee species, they should make attempts to provide bare ground, 
vertical banks, water and mud sources along with plants that provide stems for 
cavity nests and resins and leaf pieces as nest building materials.
7 Where to look for further information
Students, professors, land managers and conservation biologists are 
encouraged to search for additional and more modern references in the 
primary scientific literature. One excellent way of doing this is simply to do 
keyword searches in Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com) or JSTOR 
(a digital library founded in New York City in 1995). Advanced key word 
searches can be easily made in its online database (www.jstor.org/action/
showAdvancedSearch). Looking in the literature citations of recent review 
papers (e.g. in Annual Reviews of Entomology or Ecology and Systematics: in 
Annual Reviews: https://www.annualreviews.org) is another excellent way to 
mine the historical and modern literature to find more articles on topics of your 
choice.

1 Introduction
Agricultural intensification, or the increase in crop production per unit land 
area, has resulted in high-input, large-scale monoculture cropping and 
overall declines in crop diversity in the USA (Aguilar et al., 2015) and greater 
homogeneity in the crops grown across regions at a global scale (Martin 
et al., 2019). This has often resulted in agricultural landscapes devoid of the 
habitat and floral resources needed to sustain pollinators. In addition to a 
reduction in crop diversity, the intensified use of agrochemical inputs reduces 
populations of flowering weeds that can provide floral resources for pollinators 
and introduces compounds into the environment found to be toxic to sensitive 
pollinator species (van der Slujis et al., 2013). Modern crop production systems 
are, thus, thought to contribute to declines in pollinator populations that we 
rely on for the pollination of economically important crops and wild plants.
To address this pressing issue, agriculture must develop practices that 
diversify the agricultural landscape to enhance the availability of floral resources 
and habitat within the crop production space. This approach, known as land 
sharing, is in contrast to the land sparing paradigm where natural lands are 
set aside for conservation purposes and are distinct management units from 
agricultural lands (Phalan et al., 2011). The land-sharing paradigm, however, 
is thought to be a more realistic approach given the demands a growing

population has placed on agricultural lands and the benefits that increased 
biodiversity has on agroecosystems and agricultural production (Tscharntke 
et al., 2005, 2012).
Another chapter discusses in more detail the management of field margins, 
wildflower strips, or other adjacent and surrounding habitat to crop fields that 
contribute to landscape diversity and enhanced pollinator resources. In this 
chapter, the focus is on approaches to enhance plant diversity within the crop 
production space. Approaches by which this can be achieved include in-field 
practices such as the planting of flowering cover crops between crop rotations, 
intercropped with cash crops, or in place of a cash crop, planting of diverse 
perennial forages that also provide floral resources, and maintaining flowering 
weed communities if they pose little threat to crop production.
2 Approaches to managing production space for 
pollinators
2.1 Cover crops
Cover crops play a critical role in providing habitat and floral resources to 
promote pollinators and pollination within the crop production space or 
field, i.e. not only field edges or margins as discussed in a previous chapter. 
Integrating flowering cover crops is challenging due to the need to reduce 
competition for space and other resources with the primary cash crop. 
However, there are a number of ways in which this can be achieved, including 
planting overwintering (cold-hardy) cover crops that provide early-season floral 
resources prior to a cash crop, planting full-season cover crops in lieu of a cash 
crop or fallow ground (bare ground not planted to a cash crop), or strip or 
companion plantings between crop rows or on orchard floors.
Planting overwintering cover crops in the fall for early spring flowering can 
be an effective way to reduce competition with the primary cash crop while 
providing floral resources at a time when few are available across the landscape 
(Bretagnolle and Gaba, 2015). Examples of cold-hardy species that also flower 
early the subsequent year, which is particularly important in northern growing 
zones, are winter camelina (Camelina sativa L.), winter canola (Brassica napus
L.), and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) (Eberle et al., 2015). Other cover crops 
that overwinter, though to varying extents depending on planting date and 
climate, include red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and Austrian winter pea (Pisum 
sativum subsp. arvense L.; Ellis and Barbercheck, 2015). In warmer climates 
or southern growing zones, additional cover crops will likely overwinter, but 
the timing of flowering may limit their use if impacts on the subsequent cash 
crop are a primary consideration. Further, if the cover crop is to double as 
an economic crop (winter camelina and pennycress, for instance, are being Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators 285
developed as oilseed crops; Cubins et al., 2019), adjustments to the crop 
rotation and agronomic management would be necessary to accommodate 
cover crop seed harvest for a relay- or double-crop system (Patel et al., 2021; 
Ott et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2017; Gesch et al., 2014).
Cover crops may be planted as full-season crops for a variety of reasons. 
They may be planted in fields that would otherwise remain fallow or in fields 
where adverse conditions such as drought or excess moisture result in a failure 
to plant an insured crop by a certain date (also known as prevented planting; 
2013 Crop insurance handbook, USDA-RMA, 2013). Though not as common, 
full-season cover crop mixtures may also be integrated into a crop rotation to 
achieve soil health benefits and provide a forage source for livestock (Housman 
et al., 2021; Sanderson et al., 2018). With the inclusion of flowering species in 
full-season cover crop mixtures, season-long floral resources that support both 
managed and wild pollinators may be achieved, though cover crop species 
selection and mixture composition will influence the species of pollinators 
attracted (Mallinger et al., 2019).
Companion planting with flowering cover crops in intercropping 
systems is another approach that can sustain pollinator communities within 
crop production fields (Kordbacheh et al., 2020; Norris et al., 2018). In some 
instances, intercropping with flowering species does not only attract beneficial 
insects strictly for pollination services, but, as is the case with alyssum (Lobularia 
maritima (L.) Desv.) in organic lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and broccoli (Brassica 
oleracea L. var. italica Plenck) production fields, it may also attract predatory 
insects such as hoverflies that reduce pest populations (Brennan, 2013, 2016). 
Intercropping with non-flowering ground covers that release volatile organic 
compounds such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita) can also support pollinators 
and other beneficial insects (Gowton et al., 2021). Further, orchard production 
systems with cover crop ground covers can also act as a companion planting 
system to provide a number of benefits including habitat and floral resources 
for pollinators (Van Sambeek, 2017; Saunders et al., 2013). Companion or 
intercropping systems should, however, be managed with a holistic approach 
that reduces reliance on commercial inputs, as pesticide exposure, which is a 
well-documented source of bee declines, is an ever-present risk to pollinators 
(Nicholls and Altieri, 2013).

Within the production space, floral resources for pollinators can be provided by 
commercial crops, cover crops, intercrops, and even flowering weeds. Where 
flowering weeds do not significantly compete with and reduce crop yields, 
they can be an effective and affordable way to provide pollen and nectar 
for pollinators. Flowering weeds can supplement the crop plant during crop 286 Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators

bloom, as an alternative source of nectar and pollen, or, more importantly, 
extend the flowering season to provide floral resources for pollinators outside 
of crop bloom. Weeds often flower in high density and require few inputs, thus 
offering a cost-effective way to enhance or conserve pollinator communities.
Weed communities within crop fields have shifted with increasing 
agricultural intensification to favor weeds that are resistant to herbicides or 
germinate late to escape herbicides, with resulting on-farm weed community 
simplification (Bretagnolle and Gaba, 2015). Nonetheless, on-farm weeds can 
provide equal or even better floral resources for pollinators as compared to 
adjacent natural/semi-natural habitat as the open canopy of crop fields facilitates 
high flower density (Gemmill-Herren and Ochieng, 2008). Furthermore, weeds 
are often top nectar and pollen producers, outproducing intentionally grown 
plant species that are typically present in lower densities (Hicks et al., 2016). 
For honey bees, in particular, flowering weeds have been found to be a major 
source of food (Requier et al., 2015).
Flowering weeds can enhance pollination services through increasing 
crop flower visitation rates via a spillover effect in which pollinators attracted 
to flowering weeds move over to pollinate the crop plant, or they can enhance 
pollinator abundance and/or diversity via increased season-long resource 
availability. In the case of the former, effects on crop pollination could be 
realized immediately, while in the case of the latter, effects are typically seen 1–3 
years following resource enhancement. Examples from sunflower crop fields 
have illustrated the benefit of weeds for pollinator communities and pollination 
services. For example, higher on-farm weed diversity in sunflower fields was 
correlated with a higher diversity of pollinators visiting sunflowers, and seed 
mass increased with flowering weed species richness. In a different example, 
the diversity of weed flowers had a positive impact on the species richness 
of pollinators visiting sunflowers and on sunflower seed set (Carvalheiro 
et al., 2011). Additionally, the presence of flowering weeds within sunflower 
fields mitigated some of the negative effects of reduced natural habitat in the 
surrounding landscape on pollinator diversity (Carvalheiro et al., 2011). These 
examples from sunflowers illustrate how flowering weeds can benefit not only 
pollinator communities but pollination services and crop yields as well.
However, weeds can compete with the crop plant for space, nutrients, 
and water, thereby reducing crop plant densities and overall yields (Sidemo￾Holm et al., 2021). They can also compete for pollinators if bloom time overlaps 
and if they are more attractive than the crop plant. To reduce competition for 
pollinators, weeds can be mowed or spot treated during bloom, but allowed to 
flower outside of bloom. Another cost is greater pesticide risk to pollinators; the 
presence of flowering weeds could increase pollinator exposure to pesticides 
applied outside of crop bloom with significant negative effects on pollinator 
populations (Larson et al., 2013). To prevent exposure to pesticides, flowering Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators 287
weeds should be mowed or treated prior to insecticide applications when 
possible.
2.3 Flowering crops
Large homogeneous row crop systems dominated by corn and soybean, often 
representative of agriculture in the US Midwest, do not provide the nectar and 
pollen resources needed to support many pollinator populations. Declines 
in crop diversity in US cropland (Aguilar et al., 2015) have resulted in fewer 
flowering crops that sustain pollinator resources. Therefore, diversification 
strategies are needed to restore plant diversity and re-introduce flowering 
economic crops into crop rotations that can improve habitat and foraging 
resources for pollinators (Nicholls and Altieri, 2013).
Crops such as sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum 
esculentum Moench), flax or linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), canola, and 
other flowering (forbs) crops can provide floral resources that attract diverse 
species of pollinators at varying times of the growing season (Mallinger et al., 
2019; Campbell et al., 2016; Eberle et al., 2015) and, in some instances, may 
also benefit from insect pollination (Mallinger et al., 2018; Witter et al., 2015). 
Forage crops such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and clovers (Trifolium spp.) 
have also been shown to provide floral resources attractive to some pollinator 
species (Butters et al., 2022; Bryan et al., 2021), though these crops are typically 
harvested prior to mass bloom events.
Other lesser known but emerging forage crops such as silflower (Silphium 
integrifolium Michx.) and cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) support a high 
abundance of diverse bees when planted as crop borders (Butters et al., 2022), 
but more work is needed to develop breeding and agronomic management 
strategies to successfully integrate them into crop production systems (Van 
Tassel et al., 2017; Lehmkuhler et al., 2007). It is likewise worthy to note 
the potential for extreme climate scenarios, i.e. drought, to reduce nectar 
production of crops such as buckwheat and cup plant, thereby reducing the 
benefit of these flowering crops for pollinators (Rering et al., 2020; Mueller 
et al., 2020).
2.4 Crop rotations
Rotating crops across growing seasons and years can mean temporally 
inconsistent resources for pollinators, especially when nectar and pollen-rich 
crops, such as melons, are rotated with less attractive and resourceful crop 
such as grains. However, crop rotations can be designed to allow for pollinator 
populations to persist in heterogeneous and disturbed environments. It may 
be particularly important to consider how crop rotations affect pollinator 288 Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
population persistence when animal-pollinated crops are used in rotation 
with non-flowering crops or crops that are wind-pollinated. Examples include 
oilseed crops such as sunflowers, oilseed rape, and flax, which are typically 
grown on 3–4-year rotations with wind-pollinated crops including wheat or 
barley, or with fallow fields. Additionally, pollinator-dependent melons, squash, 
and other cucurbits are grown on a 3+-year rotation with a variety of crops 
including many that do not provide significant floral resources for pollinators 
(e.g. greens, root vegetables, legumes, oats, and wheat) or with fallow fields.
Rotated crops pollinated by specialist pollinators are at particular risk 
of experiencing reduced pollination services due to inconsistent and small 
pollinator populations. For example, sunflowers in North America receive 
significant pollination services from specialist bees including long-horned 
bees in the tribe Eucerini that rely on sunflowers or other Asteraceae species 
(Mallinger et. al., 2018). Squash is also pollinated by a few species of specialist 
squash bees that rely on squash and related Cucurbitaceae plants (Tepedino, 
1981). For specialist sunflower and squash bees, the absence of their 
preferred or required plant hosts in some years may limit population growth 
and persistence. Unlike with generalist pollinators, these specialists cannot 
take advantage of other crops in the rotation or flowering weeds in the crop 
fields. Thus, particular attention needs to be given to designing crop rotations 
to ensure some resource availability within the specialist pollinator’s foraging 
range.
Limited research on crop rotation effects on pollinator populations has 
been conducted, and therefore recommendations are also limited. Rotating 
crops at the level of individual fields, and staggering rotation cycles across 
adjacent fields, can achieve the benefits of crop rotations for disease pressure 
and soil health while still ensuring that the pollinator resources provided by 
certain crops are present in the broader landscape. Larger-bodied pollinators, 
including some specialist sunflower and squash bees, may forage a few 
hundred meters and up to 1 km from their nests (Gathmann and Tscharntke, 
2002; Greenleaf et al., 2007), though other studies suggest most bees forage 
locally within a small radius (Sardiñas et al., 2016). Thus, rotations would need 
to be designed to ensure resource availability within a few hundred meters, 
which may not be feasible in many landscapes. However, some studies suggest 
that consistent and high presence of the focal pollinator-dependent crop in the 
landscape does not improve pollination services to the focal crop (Andersson 
et al., 2014). Alternatively, including some flowering forbs in the landscape each 
year or growing season, especially for generalist pollinators that are able to 
take advantage of a diversity of floral resources, can reduce negative effects of 
crop rotations. These floral resources could be provided by other crops in the 
rotation or by stable, flowering field margins and flower strips. In some studies, 
generalist pollinator abundance was affected by crop rotation schemes, but Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators 289
stable crop boundary features mitigated the negative effects of crop rotations 
on floral resource availability and pollinator populations. Thus, having larger 
and more stable areas of pollinator habitat near crop fields may be the best way 
to ensure temporally consistent resources in rotational landscapes (Marja et al., 
2018; Gardner et al., 2021).
2.5 Providing protected nesting areas within the production 
space
Many pollinators need nesting habitat in addition to floral resources. For 
example, the majority of bees nest belowground and require soil of suitable 
texture, slope, and accessibility, and with minimal disturbance (Danforth et al., 
2019). For bees that nest aboveground, the majority are considered renters 
and need hollowed cavities, while a minority will excavate nests in a substrate 
such as wood (Danforth et al., 2019). While the majority of research, particularly 
for wild bees, has focused on nest habitat adjacent to the field within field 
margins or hedgerows, in this section we cover agronomic practices to provide 
or enhance nest habitat within the production space. In fact, some wild bees, 
such as specialist squash bees, preferentially nest within crop fields over areas 
adjacent to the field (Julier and Roulston, 2009).
Agronomic practices that can affect nesting habitat for bee pollinators 
include irrigation and tillage, inclusion of trap nests for aboveground nesting 
bees, and manipulation of soil to intentionally create belowground nesting 
habitat. Squash bees, important solitary bee pollinators of Cucurbita spp., 
have been shown to prefer irrigated soils (Julier and Roulston, 2009), and thus 
regular irrigation within these fields may enhance their nesting rates. However, 
little is known about how irrigation affects other bee species. The effects of 
tillage are better documented, though the focus is largely on squash bees, 
and results are mixed. In some contexts, squash bee abundance did not vary 
across farms differing in tillage intensity (Julier and Roulston, 2009), but in other 
studies, populations were more abundant in no or reduced tillage systems 
(Shuler et al., 2005; Appenfeller et al., 2020). In a more controlled study, tillage 
moderately reduced and delayed offspring emergence but did not completely 
eliminate emergence or destroy nests (Ullmann et al., 2016). However, squash 
bees also seem to prefer nesting in tilled soils (Skidmore et al., 2019) despite 
the impacts that tillage may have on future offspring emergence. And, in the 
lone example conducted in other agricultural systems (perennial vineyards), 
alternating tillage systems had a positive effect on bee pollinator abundance 
and diversity as compared to no tillage, suggesting that some amount of soil 
disturbance can increase nesting rates and bee populations (Kratschmer et al., 
2019). These studies suggest overall that there may be benefits to reduced 
tillage, especially for squash bees and within agroecosystems with significant 290 Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
tillage intensity, though soil accessibility is also important for bee nesting rates 
and can be achieved through occasional or alternating tillage practices.
Intentionally creating nesting space for wild bees within the production 
space is not common and limited to a few specific agroecosystems. Perhaps 
the most well-known example of creating ground-nesting habitat is with the 
alkali bee, an important pollinator of alfalfa in western North America. While 
this bee is solitary, it nests in aggregations underground within soil of sufficient 
alkalinity, texture, and moisture (Danforth et al., 2019). These soil attributes 
have been successfully manipulated in nest boxes or artificial bee beds at 
ground level through the addition of soil, salt, and irrigation, and have been 
shown to increase local populations (Stephen, 1960; Cane, 2008). Another 
opportunity for providing ground-nesting habitat is for the Southeastern 
blueberry bee Habropoda laboriosa, an important pollinator of blueberries in 
the Southeastern USA. It has been shown to readily nest in manmade holes in 
the ground, suggesting that nest habitat could be created but is also highly 
sensitive to changes in visual cues associated with the nest site (Cane, 1994). 
Finally, the use of trap nests within the crop field to provide nesting habitat for 
both wild and managed aboveground cavity nesters has been done in alfalfa 
for the managed alfalfa leafcutter bee (Pitts-Singer and Cane, 2011), in almonds 
for the managed orchard mason bee (Boyle and Pitts-Singer, 2019), and in 
oilseed rape fields for wild bees (Dainese et al., 2018).
3 Case studies
3.1 Annual row crop systems
Increasing plant diversity within row crop production fields can be achieved 
by integrating cover crops or native species within a crop rotation using four 
primary strategies: (1) intercropping (mixed, strip, or otherwise) or companion 
cropping with cover crops, forages, or native species that provide floral 
resources and habitat for pollinators; (2) strategic placement of flowering 
cash crops (including forages) across the landscape; (3) replacement of a 
monoculture cash crop, fallow fields, or in prevented plantings scenarios with 
cover crops in the rotation; and (4) adding overwintering cover crops that 
provide floral resources early in the season and do not compete with cash crops. 
The examples provided in this section will focus on the two latter strategies.
In North Dakota, USA, annual cover crops planted specifically for the 
purpose of providing full-season ground cover and floral resources were 
shown to support diverse bee populations (Mallinger et al., 2019). Flowering 
cover crops such as buckwheat, sunflower, and phacelia were planted in 
single-species stands, i.e. monocultures, and in mixtures of two, three, and six 
species (with cowpea, hairy vetch, and kale/mustard). Low-diversity mixtures Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators 291
with phacelia and buckwheat provided season-long floral resources at high 
densities that supported honey bees and generalist bumble bees. Adding 
sunflower into the mixture increased visitation by more rare wild bees but 
reduced visitation by managed and generalist bees due to lower floral density 
of buckwheat and phacelia flowers. Thus, more diverse mixtures increased bee 
species richness but resulted in reduced visitation by more common species. In 
addition, the cover crops evaluated in this study attracted several bee species 
considered to be in decline, many of which were also recorded in adjacent 
rangeland (minimally managed grazing areas).
Providing early-season floral resources in crop production fields lacking 
in plant diversity to sustain pollinators during this critical time of year is also 
crucial. Planting cold-hardy, overwintering cover crops may play an important 
role in filling this niche. In Pennsylvania, USA, increasing cover crop diversity to 
include flowering crops such as canola (an early flowering crop, April–May) can 
support diverse populations of pollinators including honey bees, native bees, 
and Syrphid flies (Ellis and Barbercheck, 2015). However, crop rotations restrict 
the flowering window and effectiveness of other flowering service crops such as 
red clover and Austrian winter pea that flower later in the season (May–July). This 
study also demonstrated the importance of fall planting date on winter survival 
and spring flowering, with cover crops planted earlier (August–September) 
generally resulting in increased overwintering as well as earlier flowering in 
the spring. Work in South Dakota and Minnesota, USA, also found variability in 
winter survival of fall-planted flowering cover crops (Eberle et al., 2015). In this 
study, pennycress, winter canola, and, in particular, winter camelina provided 
floral and nectar resources early in the season to support pollinators in a corn￾soybean crop rotation. The extent to which these floral resources benefit insect 
pollinators, however, may be impacted by weather variability, particularly in the 
spring when conditions are often cool and wet in this region of the USA and 
may have variable impacts on pollinator populations (Forcella et al., 2020).
3.2 Annual specialty crop systems
Within annual cropping systems, intercropping and on-farm crop diversification 
are the primary ways in which the production system can be modified for 
pollinators and pollination services. As compared to perennial systems and 
annual row crops, there are fewer examples of altering crop management 
practices within the production space for annual specialty crops, likely because 
their high value discourages modifications within the production space in favor 
of modifications adjacent to the crop field (i.e. field margins). Additionally, 
there is minimal vertical structure to manipulate as in perennial orchard crops, 
and many specialty annual crops (e.g. vegetable crops) are not pollinator￾dependent. Here, we present three examples from annual specialty crops.292 Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
In strawberries, intercropping with Coriandrum sativum  or  Mentha 
arvensis increased flower visitor frequency overall within the field but reduced 
pollinator visitation specifically to strawberry flowers, suggesting that the 
intercrops competed with the strawberry flowers for pollinators (Hodgkiss 
et al., 2019). Treatments in which strawberries were intercropped with C. 
sativum or M. arvensis did not show improved pollination or yields. However, in 
a different system, intercropping bell peppers with basil increased pollinator 
visits to the bell peppers specifically, with resulting increases in pepper fruit 
and seed production (Pereira et al., 2015). Combined, the research to date 
suggests mixed effects of intercropping on pollination of annual specialty 
crops likely dependent on both the attractiveness of the specialty crop and 
the intercrop. Intercrops should be attractive enough to draw in or enhance 
pollinator populations, but not significantly more attractive than the specialty 
crop so as to compete for pollinators. Intercrops with peak bloom time 
slightly before the peak bloom of the specialty crop may be most effective 
for facilitating pollination. Finally, in an example of crop diversification, more 
bees were found on diversified polyculture farms than on monoculture farms, 
including more specialized bees such as the squash bee, but there was 
no assessment of how these higher bee abundances affected crop yields 
(Guzman et al., 2019).
3.3 Perennial orchard systems
While within annual specialty crops, intercropping and on-farm crop 
diversification were the primary management strategies examined, for 
perennial orchard systems, research focuses primarily on cover crops or living 
ground cover with examples from almonds, vineyards, and apples. Flowering 
ground cover within almond orchards can increase pollinator abundance 
and richness as well as fruit set. On small farms in Egypt, more abundant 
and species-rich ground cover provided by both crops and wild plants was 
associated with a greater abundance and diversity of pollinators within the 
orchard (Norfolk et al., 2016). Importantly, the abundance and species richness 
of ground vegetation were also directly associated with increased almond fruit 
set (Norfolk et al., 2016). In Spanish almond orchards, flower abundance on 
the orchard floor positively predicted wild pollinator visitation to almonds and 
pollinator species diversity and was associated with increased almond set both 
via direct effects and indirect effects mediated through increasing pollinator 
diversity (Alomar et al., 2018). Finally, in Australia, the richness of ground cover 
plants in almond orchards was associated with greater native bee abundance 
(Saunders et al., 2013), though effects on yield were not examined. Additionally, 
no examples from the primary almond production region (California, USA) link 
within-orchard vegetation to pollinators, pollination, or yield.Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators 293
Within European vineyards, greater interrow floral resource availability and 
percent vegetation cover increased wild pollinator abundance and diversity 
(Kratschmer et al., 2019), but effects on crop production were not evaluated. 
Finally, while the aforementioned studies all examined existing gradients in 
ground cover floral resources, one study found that planting cover crops within 
vineyards, including a mix of Phacelia tancetifolia, Ammi majus, and Daccus 
carota, resulted in higher abundance and diversity of wild bees as compared to 
control plots (Wilson et al., 2018). The abundances of numerous individual wild 
bee taxa, including A. mellifera, Bombus spp., Halictus spp., and Lasioglossum
spp., were all higher in vineyard blocks with cover crops as compared to control, 
though again effects on crop production were not examined (Wilson et al., 
2018). Yields in these vineyard studies were likely not examined in part because 
wine grapes have overall minimal dependence on insect pollinators (Klein 
et al., 2007), though in some cases insect pollination can improve yields and 
grape quality (Sampson et al., 2001).
3.4 Perennial forage systems (pastures and rangelands)
Perennial forage systems offer perhaps the greatest opportunity for improving 
agroecosystems for pollinators due to the large land area that they comprise and 
the diverse plant communities that they can contain. Perennial forage systems, 
including pasture and rangeland, are a major land use in North America and 
globally. Pastures and rangelands constitute approximately 22–26% of global 
ice-free land surface area and represent more land than is in forest or cropland 
(Ellis et al., 2010; Ellis and Ramankutty, 2008; Klein Goldewijk and Ramankutty, 
2004). Therefore, changes to perennial forage systems could have significant 
impacts on pollinator communities and pollination services.
Perennial forage systems can be improved for pollinators through plant 
diversification and alteration of management practices including grazing 
intensities and regimes. Adding flowering plants to forage systems has 
been shown to increase the diversity of bees and other pollinators, and with 
consequences for pollination services provided to wild and crop plants. For 
example, in a study comparing forage systems with (1) bluestem grass only, (2) 
bluestem grass mixed with alfalfa, (3) alfalfa only, and (4) mixed native grasses, 
there was a higher insect pollinator abundance and richness in the plots with 
alfalfa and native grasses as compared to bluestem only plots, and this trend 
was driven largely by native sweat bees (Bhandari et al., 2018). Additionally, 
on working grasslands, increasing plant richness by adding legumes and forbs 
resulted in increased functional diversity of pollinator communities (Orford et al., 
2016). Higher pollinator functional diversity in turn reduced variation in flower 
visitation rates to two of three sentinel crop species, including strawberry and 
red campion, that were placed within the pastures (Orford et al., 2016). These 294 Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
results conclusively show the benefits of increased forage plant diversity on 
pollinator abundance and diversity, with potential benefits for the pollination 
of adjacent crop fields.
However, one limitation to the adoption of plant diversification for 
pollinators in perennial forage systems is the perceived lack of benefits for 
the farmer given that forage system productivity is not generally thought to be 
pollinator-dependent. There is also limited information on how diverse forage 
plant communities specifically designed for pollinators could improve animal 
production or the health and productivity of the pasture. Increased pollinator 
activity and diversity could improve pollination services to flowering forage 
species, thereby reducing the need to reseed forage each year, but this has 
not been well studied. If benefits for either animal production or long-term 
forage quantity and quality could be demonstrated, the adoption of plant 
diversification for pollinators within perennial forage systems may be increased.
Along with plant diversification, altering the grazing intensity and stocking 
levels of pastures can influence floral resource availability and pollinator 
communities. However, the direction of the relationships between grazing 
intensity, floral resources, and pollinators is variable. While some studies show 
that high-intensity grazing can have negative effects on floral resources and bee 
abundance and diversity (Kearns and Oliveras, 2009; Kruess and Tscharntke, 
2002; Xie et al., 2008), other studies show no or even positive effects of high￾intensity grazing on flowers and bees (Vulliamy et al., 2006; Wallen, 2010). 
Some of this variability may be due to variable responses to grazing intensity 
across bee taxa, with bumble bees showing greater sensitivity to increased 
grazing intensity, particularly in the early season, as compared to sweat bees 
(Kimoto et al., 2012). Additionally, the relationship between grazing intensity 
and floral resources may be hump-shaped, suggesting that intermediate levels 
of grazing may be optimal for maintaining abundant and diverse pollinator 
communities (Lázaro et al., 2016). As with plant diversification, modifying 
pasture management for pollinators is unlikely to be widely adopted unless it 
can show benefits for animal production or system sustainability.
4 Assessing efficacy of alternative agronomic practices
Assessing the impact of agronomic practices on pollinators and farm productivity 
is crucial for identifying best management practices and encouraging adoption. 
However, most studies examined the responses of pollinator abundance and 
diversity to agronomic practices but did not include crop productivity and yield 
responses. In notable exceptions to this trend, Norfolk et al. (2016) and Alomar 
et  al. (2018) were able to link increased ground cover diversity and flower 
abundance to increased almond production via direct effects and indirect 
effects on increased pollinator abundance and diversity. Other work including Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators 295
yield measures found contrasting conclusions with intercropping having no 
effect on strawberry production (Hodgkiss et al., 2019) but a positive effect on 
bell pepper production via increased pollinator activity (Pereira et al., 2015). 
In all these cases, the focal crop was a pollinator-dependent crop. Examples 
of agronomic practices for pollinators benefiting crop productivity and yields 
are more limited for crops perceived to have little to no benefit from insect 
pollinators, including vineyards (Kratschmer et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2018) 
and perennial forage systems. For crops with little to no dependence on 
pollinators, farmer motivation to conserve or enhance pollinators within the 
production space may be out of general conservation principles or because 
such practices provide other tangible benefits to production.
Additionally, the scale at which these agronomic practices were 
assessed may influence the applicability of study conclusions to real-world 
agroecosystems. Many of the previously-described studies were conducted 
in small plots (Hodgkiss et al., 2019; Pereira et al., 2015; Orford et al., 2016; 
Wilson et al., 2018; Bhandari et al., 2018), and those that were done at the 
farm scale relied on existing gradients in floral resources, including weeds 
and intentionally planted species (Norfolk et al., 2016; Saunders et al., 2013; 
Guzman et al., 2019; Kratschmer et al., 2019). Few to no studies manipulated 
agronomic practices at the farm scale. These limitations can make it challenging 
to draw conclusions or make predictions for working farms. When using existing 
gradients, treatments are not randomly assigned, and variables of interest such 
as floral resource availability and diversity are likely correlated with other factors 
that vary across farms. For example, farms with greater cover crop diversity 
may also have reduced chemical inputs or a greater diversity of crop plants, 
which could additionally impact pollinator abundance and diversity. In small 
plot studies, treatments are typically randomly assigned and other variables are 
better controlled, but these results may not scale up the level of the whole farm. 
Thus, analyzing the scale at which the study was conducted, and correlations 
among different agronomic practices, is crucial for developing management 
recommendations from study results.
5 Conclusion
To summarize, agronomic strategies that seek to diversify crop and forage 
production to support pollinators and the services they provide continue to be 
evaluated, but we must be intentional and strategic in how we integrate them. 
Overall, given the large land area occupied by perennial pasture and rangeland 
along with their relatively more diverse plant communities (as compared to 
crop production systems), these areas may provide the greatest opportunity for 
altering management practices to support pollinators. However, acreage of row 
crops such as corn and soybean, which typically are characterized by large-scale, 296 Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators
Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
monoculture, input-intensive practices, has steadily increased over the last year 
30 years (USDA NASS, 2020). In 2021, corn and soybean, along with all types of 
wheat, were grown on 227 million acres in the USA alone (USDA NASS, 2021), 
and additional acreage is dedicated to other row crops, specialty crops, and 
orchard production. Thus, agricultural lands overall represent opportunities to 
not only reduce adverse impacts on pollinators but also support and sustain 
pollinator populations through strategic design and management modifications.
One challenge associated with these approaches, particularly where 
agrochemicals are heavily used, is the exposure of sensitive pollinator species 
to toxic pesticide residues. Therefore, for these strategies to be effective 
within the crop production space, use of agrochemical inputs would need 
to be reduced in order to prevent the agroecosystem from functioning as a 
population sink. Integrated pest management (IPM) and holistic approaches 
would need to be implemented more broadly to reduce adverse impacts 
on diverse pollinator populations. Conversely, IPM approaches that reduce 
insecticide applications may support greater populations of wild pollinators 
and maintain or enhance crop yields (Pecenka et al., 2021), contributing to both 
ecosystem and agronomic resilience.
Certainly, as is the case with other ecosystem services such as carbon 
markets and water quality credits, payments for pollinator provisioning and 
habitat conservation services may be one of several approaches integrated 
into a system that further incentivizes many of the practices discussed in this 
chapter. Globally, payments for ecosystem services have increased, with 
hundreds of programs now in existence, but with biodiversity PES lagging 
behind other sectors (Boetzl et al., 2020; Geppert et al., 2020; Salzman et al., 
2018). Programs and structures that support biodiversity would, by default, also 
promote pollinators. Finally, if crop rotations are to include more flowering, 
pollinator-dependent crops, crop diversity must simultaneously be maintained 
to support greater biodiversity, sustained pollination services, and the long￾term sustainability of agriculture (Aizen et al., 2019).
6 Future trends in research
Altering agronomic management practices, particularly within the crop 
production space, is challenging and poses more questions than we currently 
have answers to. For example, the literature is scant on data that quantifies 
the agronomic (e.g. yield, return on investment) and ecosystem (biodiversity) 
tradeoffs involved when implementing the approaches described in this 
chapter. Can we achieve an optimal state whereby both food production 
and farm economics are balanced with pollinator habitat and floral resource 
provisioning? What are the long-term impacts of these practices compared 
to business as usual (current) farming practices and how do they impact Published by Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023.
Altering crop management practices to promote pollinators 297
agroecosystem functioning? How do fluctuations in crop commodity prices 
and the development of new or emerging markets impact farmer willingness 
to alter their crop management practices? What other ecosystem services can 
be bundled with pollinator services to increase the use of conservation-focused 
agronomic practices across the agricultural landscape?
Future research should address these and other relevant questions if we are 
to transition from conventional production practices to more agroecologically 
based approaches. Additionally, within the context of different cropping 
systems and farming practices, research has yet to address how different 
pollinator populations will respond to these changes under current and future 
climate scenarios, and how they respond to landscape-level changes beyond 
the crop production space. These uncertainties can only be addressed and 
implemented at a transformative level by more transdisciplinary research 
that bridges disciplines in the biophysical and social sciences and invites 
co-production of research with farmers and other stakeholders.

1 Introduction
We know much about biodiversity in many parts of the world, but still 
understand very little about how species interact with each other, both directly 
and indirectly. This is important as species interactions are as fundamental as 
species richness for understanding biodiversity dynamics and the response of 
ecosystems to global environmental change (Montoya, 2015). All organisms 
are embedded within complex networks of ecological interactions, ranging 
from antagonistic processes such as predation, through to mutualisms between 
plants and pollinators. What happens to one species or community can have 
knock-on effects for other species within an ecosystem. This in turn can affect 
ecological processes, such as pollination, that are a result of the complex ways in 
which species interact with each other through coevolution. These patterns can 
be studied through the lens of ecological networks, which are representations 
of the interactions that occur between species within a community, allowing 
properties of the network, such as structure and stability, to be examined.
Within an ecological network context, pollination can be studied as a 
mutualism between animal-pollinated plants and flower-visiting animals (i.e. a 
bipartite, mutualistic network). Although ecological networks can represent a

range of interaction types across multiple trophic levels (e.g. an ocean food 
web), it is the burgeoning study of plant–pollinator interactions in particular 
that has significantly contributed to our overall understanding of the structure 
and dynamics of mutualistic networks (Bascompte and Jordano, 2013). Indeed, 
many empirical plant–pollinator networks to date have been constructed in 
agro-ecosystems, even if not formally acknowledged, and offer a range of 
applications for understanding and enhancing pollination in agriculture.
Ecological networks can be used to assess: the effects of farm management 
intensity on plant–pollinator interactions, the importance of in-crop and off￾crop plants as nectar and pollen sources; the contribution of non-crop habitats 
on farms; which species are ‘important’ (see later); the fragility of the network 
to species extinctions; and whether management interventions have been 
successful. Networks can also be used to plan management interventions 
and restoration schemes for promoting pollinators through the management 
of plants within the crop (e.g. weeds), in adjacent semi-natural habitats (e.g. 
pollinator-friendly strips via an agri-environment scheme) and/or in natural 
habitats that provide a source of pollinators within a wider farmed landscape.
In this chapter, we focus on pollination as a network-based phenomenon 
in agricultural systems. Starting with the first principles of plant–pollinator 
interactions, we describe how networks can be used to understand important 
ecological processes in agricultural environments. We demonstrate how 
concepts from the field of network ecology can be applied to develop strategies 
for sustainable management at different scales, from a single field to national 
landscapes. However, gaps in our understanding of pollination networks – for 
instance, the importance of nocturnal pollinators – limit the extent to which we 
understand the influence of pollinators in agricultural systems. We highlight 
areas that need further research and suggest ways to better understand plant–
pollinator interactions and how they can be used to promote sustainable 
agriculture.
2 Plant–pollinator networks
2.1 Basics of pollination networks
Biotic pollination involves two groups of organisms, plants and animal 
pollinators, interacting with one another in a mutually beneficial manner. These 
interactions are generally considered to be trophic (i.e. organisms feeding on 
pollen and nectar), yet they have not often been included in food web studies 
(Hale et al., 2020). As such, it is common in community ecology to represent 
the interactions between plants and pollinators as bipartite networks (Fig. 1). 
A qualitative network simply shows which pollinator species (both vertebrates 
and invertebrates) are interacting with different plant species in flowers (Fig. © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 307
1a), whereas a quantitative network shows the density of flowers, insect visitors 
and the frequency of the interactions between them, in common units (Fig. 
1b). Seminal work by Memmott (1999) showed that the vast majority of plant–
pollinator interactions are embedded in a complex ecological network, which 
can be studied in the same manner as conventional food webs. Focusing on 
an English meadow, she described how a quantitative plant visitation network 
was constructed for the plants and pollinators in the community (similar to the 
visualisation in Fig. 1b). Briefly, flower-visiting insects were sampled in a meadow 
plot (250×150 m in size) by walking transects lengthways and recording the 
identity of the species in each observed flower–insect interaction. Interactions

the network. (b) A quantitative representation of the network where the width of the bars 
represents the abundance of the insects and plants, and the width of the links represents 
the strength of the interactions (i.e. the frequency of visitation by each species of insect).

letter. The latter are shaded differently to represent different insect orders.308 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

were recorded in a swath 2  m wide along each transect, and an average of 
two transects per day were studied. Insects were either identified in the field 
or were collected and identified in the laboratory. In just a 1-month period, a 
total of 2722 interactions were recorded among 26 species of flowering plants 
and 79 species of pollinators, yet Memmott was quick to point out that this was 
only a small proportion of the expected total flower–insect interactions over 
a complete flowering season. Thus, we can see that although plant–pollinator 
networks can be relatively quick and straightforward to generate, important 
questions regarding sampling methodology, effort and other biases need to 
be considered before they can be formally analysed.
It is worth noting at this point that many studies of flower–visitor interactions 
refer to them as plant–pollinator networks, but this is technically incorrect unless 
pollination effectiveness is measured (e.g. direct contact with reproductive 
tissues of the flower and the transport and deposition of pollen), as flower 
visitation is generally considered to be a poor proxy for pollination (King et al., 
2013). Thus, more informative and realistic plant–pollinator networks can be 
created by combining visitation data with pollen deposition measurements 
(Ballantyne et al., 2015), although most, to date, do not.
There are a range of different methods for constructing flower–visitor 
networks, some of which we cover in this chapter. All approaches have some 
inherent biases, which could have important implications for researchers and 
practitioners (i.e. farmers and land managers) depending on their questions. 
In particular, a whole range of interactions with flowers can be missed if the 
sampling window is too brief, or flowers and insects can be missed during 
surveys because they are too small to see and catch. Similarly, pollinating 
animals may operate at much larger scales than the focal plants within a 
defined study plot, so the full range of interactions are missed. To investigate 
the potential for variation in the structure of plant–pollinator interactions 
arising from different construction techniques, Gibson et al. (2011) compared 
plant–pollinator networks using two different methods (25 m transects versus 
timed observations that involved watching an approximately semi-circular area 
containing at least one individual of a single plant species for 15 min) at a single 
site and over three field seasons. Not surprisingly, these methods differed in 
the evenness of observation effort among plant species in the community, 
and this was shown to significantly affect the number of unique interactions 
observed in the network. The different sampling techniques ultimately altered 
some aspects of the network structure (see Section 2.2), which has implications 
for plant–pollinator studies. Perhaps not surprisingly, to obtain more complete 
and highly resolved species-interaction networks, studies are increasingly 
advocating a combination of sampling methods. Quintero et  al. (2021) 
provide a good methodological overview of data-merging approaches for the 
construction of mutualistic networks pertinent to plant–pollinator interactions.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 309
In addition to standardised transect surveys and timed observations of focal 
plants, there are a number of other methods and tools that can be implemented 
to collect data on plant–pollinator interactions. The most recent advances use 
DNA-based methods to decipher interactions by collecting samples and/or 
environmental DNA (eDNA) from insects and plants (Evans and Kitson, 2020). 
For example, Thomsen and Sigsgaard (2019) performed eDNA metabarcoding 
of flowers from several different plant species (i.e. a phytocentric approach) 
in Denmark using two sets of generic arthropod primers (targeting the 16S 
rRNA and COI mitochondrial genes). They found at least 135 arthropod species 
in 67 families and 14 orders, together representing diverse ecological groups 
including pollinators, parasitoids, gall inducers, predators and phytophagous 
species. Using an insect-focused (i.e. zoocentric) approach, Macgregor et al. 
(2019) constructed and compared moth pollen-transport networks using two 
methods: light microscopy and DNA metabarcoding. DNA metabarcoding 
detected pollen on more individual moths and detected multiple pollen 
types on more individuals than microscopy. After aggregating individuals of 
each species, metabarcoding detected more interactions per moth species. 
Importantly, they found that pollen-transport network metrics differed between 
methods because of variation in the ability of each to detect multiple pollen 
types per moth and to separate morphologically similar or related pollen. The 
DNA approach also detected unexpected but plausible moth–plant interactions, 
revealing new detail about nocturnal pollination systems.
Advances in computer vision and deep learning have a range of 
applications for studying plant–pollinator interactions. Cameras and other 
sensors can effectively, continuously and noninvasively perform entomological 
observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles (Høye et al., 2021). The 
physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging 
in the laboratory and when trained on these data, deep learning models can 
provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass and diversity. Thus, there is 
considerable promise for not only counting and identifying insects in the 
field using this technology but capturing information on the plants they are 
interacting with (and going beyond simply observing which insects are visiting 
the flowers).
Before formal network analysis can begin, complete, highly resolved plant–
pollinator networks are required. There are a number of ways in which this can 
be achieved for plant–pollinator networks. First, as already described, merging 
different sampling methods (e.g. plant and insect-focused approaches) is likely to 
produce the most complete networks and compensate for biases inherent to some 
of the methods described earlier (Quintero et al., 2021; Evans and Kitson, 2020; 
Wirta et al., 2014). Second, recent work has highlighted that most plant–pollinator 
networks to date are incomplete because they fail to include nocturnal pollinators 
(Macgregor et al., 2015). Combined diurnal and nocturnal networks may reveal 310 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

the extent of redundancy and complementarity of pollination interactions in 
ecosystems. Indeed, it would appear that nocturnal moths are important but 
overlooked pollinators based on studies that have examined the pollen they 
carry (Devoto et al., 2011; Banza et al., 2015; Macgregor et al., 2017). Third, 
the quantitative analysis of ecological networks can be directly affected by the 
proportion of all interactions that have been observed. Sampling completeness of 
interaction data can be estimated using abundance-based and incidence-based 
species richness estimators (Macgregor et al., 2017; Traveset et al., 2015; Chacoff 
et al., 2012). The assessment of interaction datasets assists with the quantitative 
and comparative analyses and interpretation of network properties.
Transitioning towards highly detailed flower–visitor and pollination 
networks will allow for a greater level of predictive power and provides an 
important step towards operationalising network ecology for sustainable 
agricultural management. We address this challenge in Section 4.
2.2 Structure matters
Investigating the structure of plant–pollinator networks can tell us much about 
how they function, the importance of species or groups of species, their fragility 
to species loss and their potential ability to influence agricultural management 
strategies to benefit crop production. Basic information about which animals 
are interacting with which plants can be used to generate networks that shine a 
light on the structure, complexity and stability of ecosystems around the world. 
It is not our intention to provide a comprehensive overview of bipartite network 
topology, visualisation and analyses, which are fully described elsewhere 
(Dormann et al., 2009; Ings et al., 2009; Memmott, 2009; Tylianakis et al., 
2010; Bascompte and Jordano, 2013). Rather, our aim is to introduce readers 
unfamiliar with network ecology to the basics in order to make informed 
decisions regarding agricultural management and/or pollinator conservation. 
This requires just a small step change in the way plants and pollinating insects 
are conventionally sampled. We start by looking at some simple network 
metrics/descriptors that are commonly used to describe the structure and 
complexity of plant–pollinator networks (Table 1) before showing how these 
can be used to answer a range of questions in ecology and evolution, with 
particular reference to agriculture.
Network ecology is rooted in the mathematical field of graph theory where 
a ‘graph’ is a representation of a set of elements, some of which are connected. 
In this context, a graph is made up of ‘vertices’ (singular: a ‘vertex’) or ‘nodes’ 
which are connected by ‘edges’ or ‘links’. In essence, that is it: a network 
comprises pairs of nodes connected by links. For plant–pollinator networks, 
individual plants and pollinating animals are represented as nodes, with links 
representing the interactions between different animals and plants (Figs 1© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 311
and 2). These are commonly represented as a matrix, with zeros indicating no 
interaction between a plant and pollinator and values of one indicating the 
presence of an interaction. More information, however, can be stored in these 
networks (and matrices). By incorporating additional information, such as 
abundances and frequency of interaction, there are a plethora of ways in which 
to describe the structure and complexity of these networks (both qualitatively 
and quantitatively) which are suited to particular ecological questions. Dormann 
et al. (2009) provide an introduction to metrics, graphs and null models that are 
produced in the ‘bipartite’ package in R (R Core Team, 2021) – perhaps the best 
and most used open access software for studying plant–pollinator and other 
bipartite networks.
Bersier et al. (2002) provide a good overview of qualitative food web metrics 
such as Link Density and Connectance (Table 1) before going on to show how 
to calculate quantitative metrics, that is, those incorporating more information 
on the strength of interactions (e.g. how many times a pollinator visits a flower). 
Although often couched in the language of trophic food webs, many of these 
metrics are suitable for the study of plant–pollinator interactions. For example, 
at the network level, we can examine consumer-resource asymmetries such 
as Generality and Vulnerability, which informs us about the mean number of 
plant species per pollinator (zoocentric) and the mean number of pollinator 
species per plant (phytocentric). In much the same way that species diversity

often available.

can be calculated in community ecology, the diversity of interactions can also 
be examined, for example, Interaction Evenness. Indeed, a benefit of studying 
plant–pollinator networks is that it provides information on biodiversity (at two 
trophic levels) and interactions (i.e. pollination), allowing a way for important 
questions regarding biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to be explored.
Of the many ecological network properties that can be described (and 
too numerous for this chapter), network Robustness has received particular 
attention, partly driven by advances in computational modelling (Kaiser￾Bunbury et al., 2010; Staniczenko et al., 2010), but mostly by the desire to 
understand the real threat of biodiversity loss to ecosystem services and 
functioning (Pocock et al., 2012). This is a measure of the tolerance of the 
network to species extinctions (Dunne et al., 2002; Memmott et al., 2004). By 
simulating the sequential primary extinction of plants or pollinators within a 
network (either randomly or based on ecologically plausible scenarios), it is 
possible to plot the number of secondary extinctions that occur as a result (e.g. 
if the three plants that a pollinator only interacts with go extinct then so will the 
pollinator) and Robustness is calculated as the area under the curve (Figs 3a

and b). Over the past decades, our understanding of network Robustness to 
species loss has advanced from studies of simple qualitative, bipartite 
mutualistic networks (Memmott et al., 2004), to investigations of patterns 
across ecosystems (Srinivasan et al., 2007; Evans et al., 2013) and to current 
quantitative approaches that take into account species abundance (Figs 3c and 
d) (Kaiser-Bunbury et al., 2010) or use a Bayesian approach (Young et al., 2021).
With multiple studies from around the world using such metrics, it is possible 
to start looking for universal patterns in plant–pollinator networks (with all of 
the caveats associated with standardisation). For example, empirical studies 
have found that the structure of plant–pollinator networks are typically more 
nested than expected by chance alone (Pawar, 2014) (note there are a range

represent the median robustness curve, with black dotted lines representing the minimum 
and maximum robustness curves. All curves were derived from 1000 simulations, where 
plant species are randomly removed from the network. Red solid lines indicate scenarios 
where plant species are removed along a gradient from generalists to specialists (i.e. 
plants connected to the greatest number of pollinators through to those connected to 
the least number of pollinators), representing a potential worst-case scenario.314 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

of methods to calculate Nestedness). Here, specialist pollinator species visit 
plant species that are subsets of those visited by more generalist pollinators. 
Nestedness has high ecological and evolutionary importance due to its role 
in enhancing species persistence and community stability. It should be noted, 
however, that Nestedness measures tend to be correlated with fundamental 
properties of networks, such as size and Connectance, and so Nestedness values 
(and indeed many other network metrics) must be normalised to enable fair 
comparisons between different ecological communities. Thankfully much work 
is going into providing statistical solutions and packages to overcome such 
issues (e.g. Hoeppke and Simmons, 2021), but these are nevertheless important 
considerations for anyone considering getting started in network ecology.
Over the past decades, studies have used metrics, such as Connectance
and Nestedness, to characterise the structure of mutualistic and antagonistic 
networks and the roles of their constituent species. However, compressing 
a complex network into a single metric necessarily discards large amounts 
of information (especially regarding indirect interactions, see Section 2.3). 
Therefore it is common for studies to report a range of metrics pertinent to the 
ecological question being asked (see Tylianakis et al., 2007, for an example). 
Unfortunately, a few studies simply report ‘commonly used’ network metrics 
without necessarily considering their biological relevance, perhaps showing 
a disconnect between what is now computationally straightforward and fast 
using freely available software with a detailed understanding of the natural 
history of their study systems.
In addition to network-level metrics, a range of useful others can be 
calculated at the species-level, the most basic being Degree – the sum of links 
per species. Key plant species usually have high levels of Centrality – a suite of 
metrics that describe the contribution of individual species to network structure. 
For the study of plant–pollinator networks, the shannon Diversity of interactions 
per species or Resource Range (an index of unused resources (Poisot et al., 
2012)) might be useful for answering particular questions, and others such as 
the pollination service/support index (PSI), which estimates the importance of a 
pollinator for all plant species (and vice versa), can also be determined. Again, 
by incorporating data on species and how they interact into an ecological 
network, we can move beyond conventional methods for describing ecological 
communities (such as species richness) to more sophisticated eco-evolutionary 
ways of studying biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, species ‘importance’ 
and extinction risks.
2.3 Direct and indirect interactions
Most of the interactions we have described so far refer to direct interactions, 
that is, a pollinator visiting a plant or two pollinators competing with one © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 315
another. However, a range of indirect interactions can also occur when 
organisms interact with one another through an intermediate organism, and 
ecological networks lend themselves well to the study of them. We have 
already shown how studies use basic indices, such as Connectance and species 
Degree, to characterise the structure of ecological networks and the roles of 
their constituent species. But compressing a plant–pollinator network into a 
single metric necessarily discards large amounts of information about indirect 
interactions. This is significant as indirect effects in mutualistic networks are a 
major process governing coevolution (Guimarães et al., 2017) and a growing 
body of literature is showing the important and widespread indirect effects in 
nature (Wootton, 2002). Therefore, uncritical use of network and species-level 
indices as the sole method for characterising network structure risks missing all 
or part of this component (Simmons et al., 2019).
The concept of motifs (subgraphs representing patterns of interactions 
between a small number of species) is gaining momentum as it complements 
existing metric-based approaches described earlier by incorporating more 
explicit detail on realised direct interactions and thus potential indirect 
interactions. For example, Simmons et al. (2019) demonstrated their application 
by highlighting how indirect interactions can result in ecologically important 
differences between two pollinator species with similar direct interactions. In 
the study of a plant–pollinator community in the Seychelles, using the species￾level metric d’ (a specialisation index) they were able to show that both a native 
(Lasioglossum mahense) and a non-native (Apis mellifera) pollinator were 
super-generalists. However, by then using a motif approach they revealed that 
they were generalists in different ways, which would have been missed using 
conventional metrics. Their analysis showed that L. mahense and A. mellifera
had significant roles over time and exploited different areas of interaction niche 
space. L. mahense  was shown to be in greater competition with generalist 
pollinators than A. mellifera which visited more specialist plants and competed 
with more specialist pollinators.
In plant–pollinator networks, the potential for an indirect effect between 
co-flowering plant species may lead to facilitation, whereby the presence of 
one plant species increases pollinator visitation for another. Or it could lead 
to competition, whereby the presence of one plant species attracts effective 
pollinators away from another (Morales and Traveset, 2009). This can be a 
concern to farmers who fear that providing alternative foraging habitat will draw 
pollinators away from crops. An analysis of 750 quantitative plant–pollinator 
networks from 28 studies around the world (and representing diverse biomes) 
revealed that the potential for one plant species to influence another indirectly 
via shared pollinators was greater for plants whose resources were more 
abundant (higher number of flowers and nectar sugar content) and accessible 
(Carvalheiro et al., 2014). The study showed that potential indirect influence 316 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

was also stronger between phylogenetically closer plant species and that there 
were important differences for bees compared to other groups.
While network and species-level metrics can be powerful tools for 
understanding plant–pollinator interactions, it is important to be aware of their 
limitations and that there are a range of ways of explicitly incorporating indirect 
effects into analyses. Nevertheless, an understanding of both direct and indirect 
effects, using a network approach, has considerable promise for sustainable 
agro-ecosystems in terms of in-crop and off-crop plant management, which we 
examine in the next sections.
2.4 Using networks to address agricultural challenges
While not explicitly stated, much of our general understanding of both mutualistic 
and antagonistic networks are thanks to empirical species-interaction data 
generated from a wide range of agro-ecosystem studies, in particular plant–
pollinator networks. Tylianakis et al. (2007) set the standard for assessing the impact 
of agriculture on quantitative ecological network structures, and there remains 
huge scope for asking how different types of agriculture affect biodiversity and 
how biodiversity provides a range of ecosystem services (which are effectively the 
product of networks of interactions between species), such as pollination and pest 
control (see Miller et al., 2021, for the state of the art of host–parasitoid networks). 
More recently, network theory has advanced to include people in networks (i.e. 
social–ecological networks) for ecosystem service assessments (Dee et al., 2017) 
and we describe some of these recent advances in Section 5.
In terms of promoting pollinators for agriculture, network approaches have 
great potential, especially in the context of enhancing crop yield (although 
delivery of crop pollination services has been shown to be an insufficient 
argument for wild pollinator conservation (Kleijn et al., 2016)). This essentially 
involves linking network structure with ecosystem functioning, although studies 
measuring the impacts of pollinator-supporting practices on pollination service 
success – particularly in relation to long-term crop yield and economic profit – 
are still rare (Garibaldi et al., 2014). The key question is what in-crop and/or off￾crop management techniques can enhance animal-pollinated crops?
Carvalheiro et al. (2010) provided one of the first network studies to show 
that pollination services to mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruit crops declined 
with distance from natural habitat even in biodiversity-rich areas, with plant–
pollinator interaction data suggesting that maintaining a diversity of flower 
resources within farmland can help maintain pollinator communities. More 
general studies have also shown how agri-environment schemes can enhance 
pollinator diversity and plant reproductive success in nearby intensively 
managed farmland (Albrecht et al., 2007), with network approaches increasingly 
being used to inform agri-environment scheme design (Gresty et al., 2018).© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 317
Maia et al. (2019) calculated Centrality metrics and experimentally tested 
whether plant species’ roles in pollination networks can be used to identify 
species with the most potential to recover plant–pollinator communities. 
Informed by network data, they found that the introduction of ‘central’ plant 
species attracted a higher richness and abundance of pollinators than the 
introduction of ‘peripheral’ species and that the introduced central plant 
species occupied the most important network roles. This approach could 
have implications for farmland management and restoration in terms of 
enhancing pollination. On the other hand, little is known about the pollinators 
of rare plants, such as arable weeds, in agro-ecosystems. Gibson et al. (2006) 
demonstrated how a network approach (including a pollinator importance 
index) can be used to determine the probable pollinators of three species of 
rare arable weeds among those suffering the greatest declines in the UK. They 
found that they were linked to other plant species in the community by shared 
pollinators, which in many cases constituted the primary food sources for the 
shared pollinators.
Pocock et al. (2012) advanced our understanding of the robustness of a 
farmland ‘network of ecological networks’ (see Section 3.2 for more details) by 
simulating the sequential loss of plants shared by a range of animal groups on 
an organic farm and calculating the number of secondary extinctions. They not 
only found that the flower–visitor network was the most fragile but identified 
which plants were disproportionately important to overall network integrity. 
This has implications for farmland restoration, especially the selection of plant 
mixes for agri-environmental schemes to enhance pollination and/or identifying 
weed species within crops that should be retained, although empirical testing is 
lacking (Windsor et al., 2021). A more general overview of network approaches 
(beyond just that of plant–pollinator interactions) for addressing contemporary 
challenges in agricultural research is presented by Bohan et al. (2013).
2.5 Summary
We have introduced the basics of network ecology for constructing flower–
visitor and plant–pollinator networks and provided some examples of how they 
are currently being used to answer a range of questions in agricultural research. 
Next, we consider how this approach is being used to answer questions at 
different scales, again using examples of plant–pollinator studies within an 
agricultural context.
3 Networks across scales
Pollination networks can be captured at a range of scales, each of which 
offers an opportunity to understand different aspects of pollination ecology in 318 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

agricultural systems. Previous studies have operated at several distinct scales, 
including within individual fields, across different farm habitats, among farms 
within an agricultural landscape and more broadly at the regional, national 
or continental scale. The following sections provide some examples of how 
ecological networks have been constructed for pollination networks across 
agricultural systems at all of these scales (Fig. 4).
3.1 Field
Early studies in agriculturally relevant environments, such as the pollinator 
networks in meadows we described earlier (Memmott, 1999), were completed 
at the field scale (i.e. a single habitat in a single location, Fig. 4). These original 
studies form the basis of our understanding of pollinator networks in agricultural 
systems, showing that interactions between plants and pollinators are common 
and that they can have important consequences for agriculturally important 
processes, such as crop production. At the field scale, it is possible to create 
networks with a far higher level of detail than at broader scales (including 
above- and belowground interactions), and therefore it is feasible to investigate 
processes important at a fine resolution (e.g. how changes to plant–microbe

Each scale appraised in Networks across scales is highlighted, showing the major units of 
scale (e.g. habitats at the farm scale) and the potential types of movement (grey arrows) 
and interactions (black arrows) between plants and pollinators.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 319
interactions might affect individual pollinator behaviour and visitation (Bennett 
et al., 2019)). From this research, it has then been possible to branch out to 
broader scales with studies relying on the information gathered at field scales 
to support any findings generated across farms or landscapes (see Fig. 4).
Although more recent studies have tended to focus on assessing pollination 
across multiple habitats on the same farm or across multiple farms within an 
agricultural landscape, a range of contemporary studies continue to investigate 
processes at this relatively restricted spatial scale. This is because complex or 
detailed processes often require assessments at smaller scales. For example, to 
understand the extent to which spillover effects penetrate into cropped fields, 
highly replicated studies at the field scale are necessary. Examples of such 
research have shown that despite their perceived beneficial effects, flowering 
plants in the field margins only generate positive effects on pollination services 
(seed set, pollination deposition rate and flower visitation rates)<50 m into the 
cropped fields (Albrecht et al., 2020; Zamorano et al., 2020). To get these results, 
the study by Albrecht et  al. (2020) collated data from 17 studies across 276 
fields, investigating transects up to 100 m into the cropped fields, monitoring 
plant–pollinator interactions along the transect and comparing common 
pollinator species found visiting the field margin plants as well as the crops. 
This was a common phenomenon across different crops, including oilseed rape 
(Brassica napus), pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), 
watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), red clover (Trifolium pratense), highbush 
blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and apple (Malus domestica). There is 
considerable scope for extending such studies into farm cropping systems 
across the world, providing much-needed information on direct and indirect 
plant–pollinator interactions and the contribution of natural and semi-natural 
habitats for ecosystem service provision more generally.
3.2 Farm
Few examples exist of farm-scale studies for pollinators, where a range of 
habitats across a single farm are investigated in detail. This is likely because 
a small number of proximal habitats (i.e. field margins) are the main focus 
of studies, but also that many studies instead monitor pollination across 
multiple sites with the aim of achieving a more representative landscape￾scale appreciation of plant–pollinator interactions. Farm-scale assessments, 
however, are important as the data they produce are at the same scale at which 
most management decisions are made as well as the scale at which policy 
interventions are targeted, such as EU Common Agricultural Policy and the UK’s 
Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) scheme.
One stand-out example of farm-scale monitoring, however, is the Hillesden 
experiment in the UK to understand the impacts of ELS on biodiversity and 320 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

ecosystem function over a 5-year period (2006–2011) (Heard et al., 2012). The 
experiment consisted of a large-scale randomised block design, with three 
different management scenarios (conventional arable management, ELS and ELS 
extra) applied to 50–60 ha of land (five replicates). As part of a wider monitoring 
strategy, flower visitation by pollinators was assessed along 2×50 m transects 
in different treatment habitats (e.g. conventional crops, field edges, naturally 
regenerated habitats and actively planted habitats), as well as through pan 
trapping. Floral resources, measured as the abundances of flowers per hectare, 
for pollinators were markedly increased under both ELS and ELS X (1% and 5% 
area out of production, respectively), in comparison to conventional farming. 
This led to (i) a greater number of pollinators (butterflies, bees and flies), two and 
ten times greater in ELS and ELS X respectively when compared to conventional 
farming; and (ii) a significantly higher number of plant–pollinator interactions 7 
and 60 times greater in ELS and ELS X. Many of these effects were generated 
through farm and landscape-scale processes, for example, the levels of non￾crop plant species in the surrounding habitats. This work reinforces the need to 
gain a detailed understanding of plant–pollinator interactions at the farm scale, 
especially when looking to understand the benefits of biodiversity for farmers.
The most comprehensive study of species interactions in an agricultural 
context to date is the ‘Norwood Farm Network’ – a study of multiple plant–animal 
interactions on a single, 125 ha organic farm in Somerset, UK (sampled over 2 
years during 2007 and 2008) (Pocock et al., 2012). This ‘network of ecological 
networks’ comprises of plants and 11 groups of animals; those feeding on 
plants (butterflies and other flower visitors, aphids, seed-feeding insects, and 
granivorous birds and mammals) and their dependents (primary and secondary 
aphid parasitoids, leaf-miner parasitoids, parasitoids of seed-feeding insects and 
rodent ectoparasites), with the specific aim of encompassing a wide taxonomic 
and functional range that included animals regarded as bioindicators and as 
ecosystem service providers (see Fig. 5). As mentioned earlier, the analysis 
revealed that the plant flower–visitor network exhibited lower robustness than 
other components, suggesting that perhaps this group should be the focus 
of biomonitoring and conservation. Evans et al. (2013) extended this work to 
examine the robustness of these networks to habitat loss (12 crop and non￾crop types were measured), moving beyond individual species deletions in the 
analyses to the sequential loss of whole communities within a given habitat, 
while also accounting for spillover effects. This is a particularly powerful tool for 
assessing the impacts of, for example, converting woodland to arable crops or 
the impacts of removing hedgerows, while also identifying habitats that might 
be disproportionately important to network integrity for resilience planning 
and restoration purposes. The study identified two semi-natural habitats (waste 
ground and hedgerows together comprising<5% of the total area of the farm) 
as being disproportionately important to the integrity of the overall network © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

and demonstrated the utility of this approach at both the farm and landscape 
scale. We return to the Norwood Farm Network and discuss current work that 
merges plant–pollinator networks with other types of interactions (especially in 
the context of multiple ecosystem service provisions in agriculture) in Section 5.
3.3 Landscape
Studies assessing pollination networks across the landscape have become 
increasingly common as theoretical and technological advances have allowed 
for highly replicated and detailed plant–pollinator networks over large 
spatial scales. In agricultural systems, there are a number of studies that have 
investigated different aspects of plant–pollinator interaction networks across 
different crops, arable systems and regions of the globe. In the following 
section, we provide details on some particularly informative studies that have 
used landscape-scale assessments of pollination networks to answer applied 
questions in agriculture.

Restoration of non-crop habitats across the landscape has been a focus 
of studies investigating multiple farms. In particular, hedgerows have been 
investigated as they are generally regarded as beneficial habitats on farms (Evans 
et al., 2013). For example, the effects of hedge restoration in a variety of arable 
systems have been investigated across California, USA (Ponisio et al., 2017). A 
series of hedgerows were planted across sites and pollinators were caught after 
visiting the reproductive parts of flowers across hedgerows, crops and weedy 
field margins (which were used as controls to compare to hedgerows). The 
number of interactions between different plants and pollinators was recorded 
to produce quantitative networks across sites (1521 unique interactions). The 
study showed that over the 8 years of hedgerow development since their 
planting, the structure of plant–pollinator networks was highly variable and 
networks reorganised themselves several times (Ponisio et al., 2017). The levels 
of turnover between habitats (mature hedgerows, developing hedgerows 
and field margins) were, however, not significantly different, indicating that 
even rapidly developing habitats support diverse pollinator assemblages. 
Within these networks, it was also noted that opportunistic attachment was the 
dominant assembly process, which means that generalist species switch the 
plants they interact with to avoid high levels of competition over resources. 
This highlights the potential for non-crop habitats to support stable and diverse 
plant–pollinator interactions which in turn may enhance the levels of pollination 
in cropped fields by exporting pollinators (Morandin and Kremen, 2013; Ponisio 
et al., 2017). The combination of results indicates the important role of habitat 
management and restoration in agriculture and the potential benefits of such 
management activities for agricultural production.
Comparisons between different farming methods are also common in 
landscape-scale studies. Organic versus conventional farming is a common 
study design present in the literature, especially over the past several decades 
(e.g. Macfadyen et al., 2009). Most of these studies occurred in arable systems; 
however, a notable exception assessed the effects of pastoral farming regimes 
on plant–pollinator networks (Power and Stout, 2011). This study went further 
than most and investigated how changes in plant–pollinator networks affect 
the fruit set of the plants (proportion of pollinated flowers per site). Ten pairs 
of organic and conventional dairy farms were assessed across Ireland, and two 
fields from each farm were surveyed three times across 2009. Walking transects 
(100×2 m) in both the edge (hedgerows) and the centre (30 m from the edge) 
of the field were done to observe both obligate and facultative pollinators. The 
main finding of the study was that pollinator networks were larger on organic 
farms due to the higher floral abundances in organic fields, and there were 
greater overall levels of pollination. Network stability was not enhanced in 
organic farms and pollinators were still vulnerable due to their relatively small 
size compared to other pollinator networks studied in the wider agricultural © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

literature (Power and Stout, 2011). A recommendation based on these findings 
was that strategic sowing of important plant species could be endorsed by 
agri-environment schemes to benefit pollinators across the wider agricultural 
landscape, not just in pastoral or arable fields, in concordance with some of the 
points we made earlier.
Extensive versus intensive agricultural practices can also be investigated 
using pollinator networks. A recent example by Guzman et  al. (2019) aimed 
to understand whether on-farm diversification (polyculture) in an intensive 
agricultural landscape could positively influence specialist pollinator species. 
The study focused on a group of squash bees (Peponapis sp. and Xenoglossa
sp.) which pollinate squash plants (Cucurbita pepo) in the San Joaquin Valley in 
California, USA. Both the abundance and number of flower visits were recorded 
for all pollinator species across five monoculture and five polyculture farms 
(>2 crop types) along two 30 m transects located 5 m from the edge of each 
squash crop. Contrary to expectations, the specialist ‘squash bees’ were not 
found in higher abundance in monocultures of squash, instead the polycultures 
supported a greater number of all types of generalist and specialist pollinators 
with the exception of honeybees (Apis sp.). Such findings offer the potential to 
develop farm-scale management, but with the added security that multiple farms 
were included in the study, thus incorporating potential variation in relation to 
many different environmental factors that can vary at the landscape scale.
3.4 National
Despite the potential for using networks for biomonitoring both biodiversity 
and ecosystem functioning (Bohan et al., 2017; Derocles et al., 2018), there are 
so far very few examples of national-scale monitoring of pollination networks. 
However, there are cases where a combination of non-target monitoring of 
pollinator species from biological records (citizen science databases) and 
secondary data on plant–pollinator interactions allows for the reconstruction 
of networks at coarse resolutions over large spatial scales. For Great Britain, 
one such example is presented by Redhead et  al. (2018) and shows great 
promise. This study constructed plant–pollinator networks at 10 km resolution 
from species co-occurrence data and potential interactions (16712 interactions 
between 485 pollinators and 499 plants). From these networks, it was possible 
to understand large-scale changes in pollinator networks, including positive 
relationships between agricultural land cover and pollinator generality and 
network robustness. The increase in robustness was due to the decreased 
prevalence of extinction-prone plant species and enhanced pollinator 
generality. It was therefore apparent that the changes in plant and pollinator 
communities in agricultural systems may make them more resilient to future 
environmental changes.324 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

3.5 Summary
We have shown how ecological networks can be used to answer questions 
relevant to agricultural management across a range of spatial scales. Until now, 
agro-ecosystems have conceptually been regarded as crop monocultures, 
with a few associated plant and invertebrate species residing in a single field. 
However, in reality, these agro-ecosystems are far more complex: a network 
of ecological interactions occur between individuals in populations, between 
species (including humans), within and between communities and functional 
groups, and across the cropped fields and other natural and semi-natural habitats 
in the agricultural landscape. Network studies are beginning to quantify the 
ecosystem services provided by biodiversity, such as crop pollination, although 
their contributions are still poorly known and rarely acknowledged (see UN 
Sustainable Development Goal 15, 2015). There is clearly much more work 
to do in terms of quantifying plant–pollinator interactions in space, time and 
across biomes, and understanding how these are embedded in much bigger, 
complex networks. We consider both of these challenges in an agricultural 
context in the next sections.
4 Increasing the completeness of pollination networks
Although pollination networks have been widely studied in agro-ecosystems, 
we have already shown that some significant gaps remain in terms of both the 
coverage and level of detail surrounding plant–pollinator interactions. Here we 
provide some further important considerations.
Species coverage remains a fundamental issue, with several groups 
underrepresented in the vast majority of studies. The focus of much research 
has been on honey and bumblebees (mainly Apis sp. and Bombus sp.) as they 
are conspicuous, as well as sometimes managed, in agricultural environments. 
Yet it is widely appreciated that wild insect pollinators such as Diptera and 
Coleoptera play an important role in the pollination of many plants, including 
agricultural crops (Garibaldi et al., 2014). Furthermore, there are also a range 
of vertebrates (particularly in tropical systems) that contribute to overall 
pollination, including amphibians, bats and some larger mammals (Ratto 
et al., 2018). Better appreciating the role of these often cryptic or difficult to 
observe/identify species is an important stage in filling out our understanding 
of pollination in agro-ecosystems around the world.
As described earlier, it has become clear that nocturnal pollinators contribute 
significantly to plant pollination and reproductive success (Devoto et al., 2011; 
Banza et al., 2015; Macgregor et al., 2015), especially in agricultural environments 
(Walton et al., 2020). However, studies to date have almost all conducted pollinator 
surveys during daylight hours, and thus only incorporate diurnal pollinators. © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 325
By not including nocturnal pollinators, many studies may be misrepresenting 
the robustness and resilience of pollination networks to management and 
environmental change. This is important as drivers of environmental change, 
such as artificial light at night (ALAN), have been shown to affect nocturnal moth 
behaviour and physiology (Boyes et al., 2021), disrupt pollen transport by moths 
(Macgregor et al., 2017) and ultimately pollination (Knop et al., 2017). Indeed, 
recent work suggests ALAN can also impact diurnal plant–pollinator interactions 
(Giavi et al., 2021), although more research is required to confirm the impacts.
Many studies investigating agricultural pollinator networks have focused 
on qualitative networks, that is, the interactions are either present or absent. 
There are, however, other data that can be incorporated into a network-based 
framework. Most simply as we describe in Basics of Pollination Networks it is 
possible to quantify the network based on the number of interactions between 
a plant and pollinator. Further to this, traits of both the pollinators (e.g. proboscis 
length) and plants (e.g. corolla tube length) can be included, and this is especially 
important as certain traits strongly affect the nature and magnitude of interactions 
(Olito and Fox, 2015). For example, a pollinator with a short proboscis is unlikely 
to pollinate a plant with a long corolla tube length. This additional functional 
information is important for understanding how the structure of pollination 
networks translates to ecological processes and thus ecosystem services.
There is still significant work to be done in order to adequately describe 
the interactions between plant and vertebrate and invertebrate pollinators 
(both diurnal and nocturnal) in agro-ecosystems across the world. While this 
requires an increase in observation effort, we have demonstrated that network 
construction methods are relatively straightforward, and as other technological 
developments such as DNA-metabarcoding, cameras/sensors and citizen 
science become mainstream, important advances can be made in filling the 
gaps. However, the considerable advantages and applications of undertaking 
the task for promoting pollination in agriculture should now be evident.
5 Embedding pollination within wider agro-ecosystem 
networks
Pollination is just one of the many types of species interactions present within 
agro-ecosystems. Plants and pollinators are also involved in a complex web 
of antagonistic, mutualistic, commensalistic and amensalistic interactions, 
including plant–herbivore, plant–microbe, pollinator–predator, pollinator–
parasite/parasitoid, as well as inter- and intra-specific competition between 
plants and pollinators. Through a series of direct and indirect interactions 
this wider ecological network (often termed a ‘multiplex network’) has the 
ability to influence plant–pollinator interactions. We have previously shown 
in the Norwood Farm Network (Fig. 5) how the flower–visitor network was 326 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

the least robust to the loss of shared plants than the other animal groups 
within the network, and how robustness analysis can also be used to identify 
disproportionately important plants (and indeed habitats) for network integrity 
(see Section 3.2). Beyond the merits of this approach for the study of plant–
pollinator interactions, it is possible to go much further analytically in terms 
of understanding the interdependencies of plants and animals in the wider 
network. For example, Pocock et  al. (2012) examined whether robustness 
co-varied between the animal groups and found evidence that although some 
did, overall, this was less than expected. In terms of practical applications, 
this could mean that targeting particular groups (e.g. birds) for conservation 
management might not have cascading benefits across the networks. This could 
challenge the current conservation paradigm of species-focused interventions 
(especially large, charismatic animals), but clearly more empirical work is 
needed to examine the cascading effects of plant and animal management on 
the wider ecosystem.
Using the same Norwood Farm Network dataset, Windsor et  al. (2021) 
evaluated the optimal mixes of plant species that could be used in field margin 
management to promote the delivery of ecosystem services (pollination and 
parasitism of pest insects) while minimising ecosystem disservices (herbivory). 
The premise here is that by only focusing on plant–pollinator networks to 
enhance crop yields (e.g. flower strips as part of an agri-environment scheme), 
farmers and land managers might inadvertently be providing a source for 
insect pests, while overlooking the potential for other types of ecosystem 
service provision, especially insect pest control. The study found that plant 
mixes designed solely for maximising pollinator species richness were not 
optimal for the provision of other ecosystem services and disservices. This 
example perfectly illustrates the importance of understanding both direct and 
indirect interactions within a farmed context, and why it is desirable to merge 
different types of ecological networks. Indeed, the ecological and evolutionary 
implications of merging different types of networks are a major focus in network 
ecology more generally (Fontaine et al., 2011).
In the examples previously described, it is assumed that the different 
interactions occur simultaneously (i.e. a pollinator can also be prey for a predator 
or a predator itself). Nevertheless, there is an additional element. Species may 
switch between different interaction networks depending on their life stage 
(e.g. through an ontogenetic niche shift). A relevant example is that some 
lepidopterans are herbivores of plants during their larval stages, yet important 
pollinators when adults (e.g. cabbage white butterflies Pieris rapae are herbivores 
of many crops but also act as pollinators). This is not often appreciated, especially 
in agricultural systems and it may be the case that the benefits of a pollinator 
may be so great as to offset the potential negative effects generated by its 
herbivorous early life stages. More research on these ontogenetic shifts in the © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 327
role of common agricultural pests and beneficial insects, however, is required 
but can easily be incorporated into ecological network analyses.
It is not just other types of ecological interaction, however, that are 
important. As described earlier, expanding ecological networks to include 
spatial aspects of agricultural systems is also possible and desirable. In the 
case of pollination, it is important to understand how pollinators link together 
plants and other organisms in different habitats. As we have seen, linkages 
between field margins and cropped fields have been a focus of much current 
research in this area. But research has shown that pollinators link together 
multiple habitats and as such effects in one are able to translate into the other. 
In the case of field margins, increasing the floral diversity and selecting plant 
species that have the potential to enhance the species richness of pollinators 
and generate a spillover of pollinators into cropped fields (Zamorano 
et al., 2020). This also has implications for the resilience of these networks in 
response to either management or environmental change, as the effects of 
either changes need not occur in the habitat of interest (e.g. crops) to have 
substantial effects.
More broadly, agro-ecosystems are a combination of social and ecological 
networks, with top-down effects of management altering the nature of ecological 
systems, including the dynamics of plant–pollinator networks (Lescourret et al., 
2015). Until recently, however, these two types of networks have been analysed 
in isolation. New studies have sought to combine social-ecological networks 
(SENs), providing insights into how management and biodiversity alter 
ecosystem functioning, including in agriculture (Hutchinson et al., 2019). Dee 
et al. (2017) provide a way of operationalising network theory for ecosystem 
service assessments, and Sayles et  al. (2019) show how the degree of SEN 
articulation can be used to answer a range of questions. Essentially, within an 
SEN ecosystem services can be represented as nodes, links or even emergent 
properties. Although more research is necessary, a theoretical example shows 
the importance of combining social and ecological networks in agriculture. At 
the landscape scale, agricultural environments are composed of different types 
of farmers, ranging from family farmers through to commercial farm managers, 
who form nodes within a farmer–biota network. Farmers are linked through 
their effects on the wider biodiversity of the landscape, that is, agricultural 
management by one farmer may affect biota and in turn have impacts on other 
farmers. For example, the application of pesticides may reduce pollinator 
diversity and thus reduce pollination across other farms and crops – even those 
where pesticides are not applied. Recent work demonstrated how a network 
approach could be used to predict ecosystem service vulnerability to species 
losses within estuarine food webs, again by developing robustness analyses 
(Keyes et al., 2021). This approach could easily be extended to agro-ecosystems 
and is likely to be a rich area of future research.328 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

Building more comprehensive and detailed pollinator networks, particularly by 
including species traits and/or phylogenetic data, will allow for an increased 
understanding of how these systems can be managed to enhance the 
sustainability of agriculture. Such networks can now be constructed thanks 
to the development of novel techniques that provide a greater level of detail 
than the previous observation-based methods we have described throughout 
this chapter. In particular, recent advances in DNA-based network construction 
methods provide unprecedented opportunities to scale up the construction 
of highly resolved plant–pollinator networks in space and time (Derocles et al., 
2018; Macgregor et al., 2019). Molecular techniques are particularly applicable 
to pollination network construction where interactions may be cryptic, 
infrequent, short-lived or difficult to observe (Vacher et al., 2016; Evans and 
Kitson, 2020). Furthermore, these techniques allow the inclusion of evolutionary 
information (e.g. phylogenetic data) that is particularly important in the context 
of using adaptive networks predictively for restoration purposes (Raimundo 
et al. 2018). For example, it may be possible to understand how both plant and 
pollinator populations respond to changing network structure (i.e. changing 
pollinator populations will in turn alter plant populations and vice versa).
Further to directly collecting more data on pollination, there are a 
number of existing data sources that can be mobilised to support applied 
research. Citizen science projects such as the UK Pollinator Monitoring 
Scheme (PoMS; https://ukpoms.org.uk/), but also routine monitoring data 
that previously has been difficult to access (e.g. Rothamsted Insect Survey; 
https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/insect-survey), now provides a wealth of valuable 
data. An immediate advantage of such schemes is that only small changes to 
sampling are required in order to quickly construct networks (Petsopoulos 
et al., 2021), that can then be used to generate long-term network data and/or 
spatial coverage to answer a range of questions relevant to agriculture and/or 
insect conservation.
As identified in Section 4 there remain gaps in both data and 
understanding surrounding pollinator networks in agricultural systems. The 
above methods present options for filling some, but not all, of this missing 
information. But other options, such as inferring networks from co-occurrence 
data exist (but see Blanchet et al., 2020), which can be used to further improve 
our understanding of pollination and the role of species interactions in agro￾ecosystems. This makes use of existing data and expert knowledge to construct 
networks. For example, based on recorded plant-pollinators from secondary 
literature it would be possible to construct a network from a simple list of 
plant and pollinator taxa at a farm, without having to complete the lengthy 
process of directly observing interactions across fields and other habitats.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 329
Links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF), for example, 
links between the community structure of pollinators and plants and the level 
of pollination, are currently poorly understood. Ecological networks present 
an opportunity to link together the structure and function of systems through 
mechanistic, process-based species interactions, for example, interactions 
between plants and pollinators directly describe the process of pollination. To 
further develop this aspect of research, however, there needs to be a greater 
focus on measuring functional endpoints alongside species interactions. For 
pollinators, measuring the implications of flower visits on the fruit or seed set 
of a given plant or plant population would help to link together the structure of 
ecological communities and the effects on ecosystem functioning.
The spatial and temporal dynamics of pollination networks are not 
included in most contemporary studies which tend to analyse the structure 
of plant–pollinator networks at a given site over a restricted time period (or 
a ‘snapshot’ of interactions in time). Yet those studies which have included a 
temporal dynamic show that pollination networks can vary drastically in space 
and time, across many different scales (Dupont et al., 2009). Adaptive network 
models, a novel suite of network analyses, present a way of dealing with the 
dynamic nature of ecological systems. These models offer an opportunity 
to incorporate additional information on the phylogeny and traits of the 
organisms that comprise a given ecological network (Raimundo et al., 2018), 
ultimately leading to the predictive use of networks. These adaptive network 
models incorporate potential functional or co-evolutionary changes that 
might manifest themselves in response to changes in the wider network, 
adding greater detail (Derocles et al., 2018). Developing adaptive network 
models within agricultural systems provides significant potential, especially in 
research investigating how human management may affect other aspects of 
the agricultural system. Examples of potential research include understanding 
the response of network structure and function to pesticide resistance, climate 
change and reductions in pollinator diversity, as well as developing precision 
fertiliser application and investigating the optimal combinations of non￾crop plants in organic agricultural systems. By developing these methods of 
analysis, we can gain more information about pollination networks, and suitable 
management practices can be developed to make use of eco-evolutionary 
principles (Loeuille et al., 2013).
Automated monitoring of plant–pollinator networks provides promise for 
high-resolution construction and analysis of plant–pollinator networks while 
minimising the number of human hours required to collect data. Existing 
technologies lend themselves to this challenge, including video footage from 
camera traps (Høye et al., 2021) and radar methods used to detect flying 
insects (e.g. vertical-looking radar: Chapman et al., 2003). In the UK, vertical￾looking radar is already used to detect flying insects such as ladybirds (Jeffries 330 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
et al., 2013) and camera traps have been effectively used to determine 
plant–pollinator interactions (Balducci et al., 2020), and such methods could 
also be applied to detect other flying pollinators. Remotely monitoring the 
movement and interactions of pollinators, and then combining these data 
with novel computational techniques such as machine learning algorithms, 
also provides an opportunity to rapidly collect large amounts of data over 
multiple scales.
A final development is to understand how plant–pollinator networks 
respond to, and recover from, a series of environmental and anthropogenic 
pressures. Pollinator and plant populations are threatened by a range of 
potential stressors and a burgeoning number of studies are investigating 
multiple drivers of change in plant–pollinator networks. First, climate change is 
a substantial threat to pollination (Settele et al., 2016). In one study, ecological 
networks were used to show how phenological shifts as a result of a doubling 
of atmospheric CO2 could theoretically reduce floral resources available for up 
to 50% of pollinator species, resulting in periods where no food plants were 
available (Memmott et al., 2007). The predicted result of these disruptions is 
the extinction of pollinators, plants and their crucial interactions. However, the 
potential functional consequences of the changes remain poorly understood. 
Second, ALAN, as explained in detail in Section 4, can disrupt both diurnal 
and nocturnal pollination networks and directly affect the levels of pollination. 
There are, however, a number of unanswered questions surrounding how 
plant and pollinator reproductive success is affected and how this translates to 
longer-term effects on pollination services (Grubisic and van Grunsven, 2021). 
Third, invasive species have the ability to threaten the stability of pollination 
networks, especially in agro-ecosystems where invasive plants and pollinating 
animals are able to outcompete native species and potentially reduce the 
overall levels of pollination. Indeed invasive species can affect the resilience 
of plant–pollinator networks to future shocks (Morales et al., 2017). Networks 
lend themselves well to studying how non-native plants can integrate into 
native plant–pollinator systems (Lopezaraiza-Mikel et al., 2007); for example, it 
may be possible to study the native networks of an invasive species to predict 
which plants and pollinators it will interact with in its non-native range but 
also its effect at a whole-community scale (Parra-Tabla and Arceo-Gómez, 
2021). Fourth, a further climate-associated stressor which is becoming more 
frequent is wildfires. Although wildfires are natural phenomena, and thus 
have always presented a disturbance to plant–pollinator networks, human￾induced climate change (and inappropriate management) has increased 
both the frequency and severity of these events (Duane and Brotons, 2021). 
Recent work on pollinator networks has suggested that if wildfires become 
more frequent under climate change, community resilience may be eroded 
(Banza et al., 2019), but that understanding the responses of such networks © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture 331
can inform management that promotes resilience and facilitates conservation 
at an ecosystem scale.
All of the above pressures, in combination with intensive agricultural 
management, can ultimately contribute to net losses of biodiversity, which 
in turn may have substantial effects on pollination (Grab et al., 2019). Most 
studies of plant–pollinator networks to date mainly focus on a single driver 
of change, but understanding how these may interact with farming practices, 
and developing management strategies that account for these alternative 
pressures on plant–pollinator networks in agro-ecosystems, is key to supporting 
pollination into the future.
7 Conclusion
In this chapter, we described some ways in which network theory can be 
used to answer important questions and address contemporary challenges 
surrounding pollination in agro-ecosystems. It is by no means a comprehensive 
review of the studies applying network theory to plant-pollination networks in 
agro-ecosystems. However, here we hope to have provided an introduction 
to the topic and demonstrated the benefits of applying network thinking to 
agricultural pollination research. We first described how to go about observing 
and constructing both flower–visitor and plant–pollinator networks, described 
the differences between the two, and the various metrics that can be used 
to summarise aspects of these networks of agricultural relevance (e.g. the 
number of pollinators visiting different plants). With examples we show how it 
is possible to use network metrics and analyses to answer important questions 
in agro-ecosystems, especially by linking network structure with ecosystem 
functioning to promote pollination. From this basis, we then described how 
plant–pollinator networks work at a range of scales from fields to national 
agricultural systems and provide examples of where contemporary studies 
have developed research at different scales to support decision-making by 
farmers and land managers. Finally, we showed how further work is required 
to create highly resolved plant–pollinator interaction networks and embed 
these networks within a wider network of networks involving other species 
interactions (e.g. predation, parasitism and competition) as well as human 
aspects such as decision-making and management practices. To enact these 
ideas, we also detailed the next stages for pollination network research in agro￾ecosystems. The state of the art for this field is interdisciplinary research (see 
Dee et al., 2017, for a general review of such ideas in the context of ecosystem 
service assessment across ecosystems). Thus, to further develop understanding 
in these systems we need to bring together specialists across disciplines, 
including farmers, land managers, social scientists, ecologists and complexity 
scientists, among many others.332 Network approaches for promoting pollinators in agriculture

1 Introduction
Apples are one of the most valuable pollinator-dependent fruit crops grown 
in the United States. National apple production in 2020 was about 10.2 
billion pounds, with a value of more than US$2.9 billion (USDA NASS, 2021). 
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the 
United States is the second-largest apple producer in the world behind China, 
followed by Poland, Turkey, and India (FAOSTAT, 2019). According to the United 
States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA 
NASS), apple is grown on more than 295000 acres in the US with 103000 acres 
in the Eastern United States and another 192000 acres in the Western United 
States (USDA NASS, 2020). In the east, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and 
Virginia are the largest producing states. Washington, California and Oregon

are the western states where most apples are grown. Where necessary, regional 
differences between eastern and western apple production are noted in this 
chapter.
Unlike many other crops, fresh market apple production is more dependent 
on qualitative characteristics such as size and shape for its highest value rather 
than on yield (Garratt et al., 2014). Apples are incapable of self-fertilization, 
even within a cultivar. This means they require cross-pollination by insects to set 
fruits and produce seeds. As an insect moves from one flower to another, it will 
transfer pollen from the anthers to the stigma to allow fertilization. Each apple 
has ten ovules. When the ovules are properly fertilized, the carpel will expand 
and protect the developing seeds. When full pollination occurs, large and 
symmetrically shaped apples are produced. If not, fruit distortion or dwarfing 
will lead to unmarketable apples (Brittain and Eidt, 1933; Partap et al., 2001; 
Ramírez and Davenport, 2013; Garratt et al., 2014; Sheffield et al., 2016). Fruit 
size is largely dependent on the number of fruit per unit area and it is common 
practice for growers to need to thin fruitlets down to the number of apples 
desired to achieve a particular size fruit at harvest. In practical terms this means 
that to achieve adequate crop pollination in apples, it is estimated that only 
2-8% of apple blossoms require full pollination (Westwood, 1993).
Commercial apple growers in the United State typically rely on managed 
honey bees (Apis mellifera) as a reliable source of pollination services with a 
recommended stocking rate of at least two hives/acre. However, honey bees 
and other pollinator species have been threatened by multiple biotic and 
abiotic factors. These stresses include pathogens, parasites, agrochemical 
exposure, lack of forage and nesting habitat (Goulson et al., 2015; Brown 
et al., 2016; McMenamin et al., 2016), all of which may contribute to pollination 
failure risk and translate to increased pollinator rental costs (Breeze et al., 2011; 
Melathopoulos et al., 2015; Bauer and Wing, 2016). Due to increased demand 
for managed pollinators and the additional costs associated with managing 
Varroa mites in hives, growers of pollinator-dependent crops have seen an 
increase in rental costs from US$35/hive to over US$100/hive (Ferrier, 2018; 
USDA ARS, 2021; US EPA, 2021). Where and when demand is particularly high, 
commercial honey bee rental prices have quadrupled in the past 10 years 
(Caron, 2009; USDA NASS, 2017; FAO, 2018).
Increasing costs and problems with honey bee supply have led apple 
growers in some regions of the United States (e.g. in eastern states) to look 
for alternatives to supplement or even replace honey bees (Crassweller et al., 
2017; Crassweller et al., 2020). For instance, some growers have employed 
other kinds of managed bees including bumble bees and mason bees (Park 
et al., 2012). While most bee species that visit orchards in bloom are native, 
some species such as the Japanese orchard bee (Osmia cornifrons) were © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

introduced specifically for apple pollination by the USDA (Yamada et al., 1971; 
Batra, 1978, 1982; Kuhn and Ambrose, 1984; Sekita and Yamada, 1993; Bosch 
and Kemp, 2001, 2002; Sekita, 2001). Nests of mason bees such as Osmia 
cornifrons or O. lignaria, are typically stocked at densities that provide 250–500 
females per acre based on rates used in almond pollination (Greer 1999; Kuhn 
and Ambrose 1984; Matsumoto et al. 2009).
Besides these managed bee species, over 50 other bee species have 
been recorded visiting apple orchards in North America, providing natural 
pollination services (Greer, 1999; Park et al., 2010; Moisset and Buchmann, 
2011; Blitzer et al., 2016; Joshi et al. 2016, Hopwood et al. 2020). Surveys of 
New York and Pennsylvania apple growers in 2017 showed that wild bees can 
often provide all of the pollination needs of apple orchards when present in 
the surrounding landscape (Park et al., 2018). In the Western United States, 
honey bees continue to be the most important pollinator in apple production 
where pollination practices are driven by lack of non-crop floral resources and 
different wild bee communities.
This chapter presents a set of pollinator best management practices (BMPs) 
for US apple production. The primary goal is to provide guidance for growers, 
crop consultants and regulators on pollinator protection in apple orchards. 
This guidance considers practical production needs and supports outreach 
and education programs to foster adoption and implementation of identified 
BMPs. In the long term, the aim is to increase understanding within the US 
apple-growing community of the benefits and opportunities around protecting 
pollinators while also protecting the crop from pest damage.
2 Apple orchard pollinators
Apples produce flowers that many kinds of insects access including bees and 
hover flies. Among these, bees are the most important pollinators. Brought to 
North America more than 400 years ago, feral honey bees (A. mellifera) were 
once common across North America but are now largely absent because of 
the accidental introduction of the Varroa mite. Managed hives are maintained 
by beekeepers to control mites and are the most important crop pollinator 
because colonies can be rented and placed where they are needed and then 
moved out once crop bloom has ended. Where wild bees are insufficient in 
number, producers routinely contract with beekeepers for pollination services. 
There are other bee species (e.g. mason bees, bumble bees) that can be 
managed for orchard pollination, but availability is often limited.
More than 50 wild (non-Apis) bee species are known to visit apples 
during bloom in North America and can be grouped into one of the following 
categories based on nesting biology:344 Best management practices for pollinator protection in US apple production

• Ground nesting bees that nest in orchard soils or in adjacent habitat – 
especially digger bees (Andrena spp.), but also cellophane (colletid) and 
sweat (halictid) bees;
• Mason bees (Osmia spp.) that nest above ground in preexisting holes in 
trees or in boxes supplied with paper straw, natural reeds or bamboo;
• Small carpenter bees (Ceratina spp.) that nest in woody plants with pithy 
stems (e.g. brambles); and
• Wild bumble bee queens collecting pollen and nectar in orchards while 
they build up their below-ground colonies for the season.
In some Eastern US orchards, wild bees may be abundant and in sufficient 
number to achieve adequate pollination without adding managed bees 
(Biddinger et al., 2013a).
3 Pests, diseases and their management in apple 
production
Apple production faces a number of arthropod pests and diseases which 
are still mainly managed by use of pesticides. It is important to remember 
that pollinator exposure to pesticides is not limited to insecticides. There is 
an increasing body of research focused on the impacts of fungicides, other 
pesticides and adjuvants on pollinator health (Hopwood et al., 2020).
3.1 Apple pests
North American apple orchards are subject to a diverse arthropod pest complex 
of up to 50 species that can cause from minor to severe damage. Economically, 
the most important arthropod pests are those that cause direct damage to 
fruit including codling moth (Cydia pomonella), oriental fruit moth (Grapholita 
molesta), plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar), apple maggot (Rhagoletis 
pomonella), and a variety of plant bugs (Sutton et al. 2014). Indirect pests that 
attack trunks, limbs, leaves or buds, include borers, leafrollers, leafminers, 
leafhoppers, aphids, scale insects, and mites (Sutton et al. 2014). When they 
are abundant, scale insects and mites can also cause direct fruit damage.
Most insecticides are not labeled for use during bloom, but some key life 
stages of the pests listed above occur immediately before or at the end of 
bloom, a timing known as petal fall. Management of arthropod pests around 
bloom is a complicated task as the pesticides applied for the control of different 
pests during that time may later affect pollinator health. For instance, where 
sap-sucking insects such as the rosy apple aphid are abundant, the timing for 
management is at green tip, as soon as eggs hatch and young nymphs start to 
feed on leaf buds and fruit clusters, but before they can cause deformed fruit © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Best management practices for pollinator protection in US apple production 345
damage. A systemic insecticide is the best and most commonly applied option 
at this timing (Crassweller et al., 2020), but previous research has shown that 
pesticide residues used to control rosy apple aphid pre-bloom can be found 
later in the nectar and pollen of apple blossoms where they could potentially 
impact pollinators (Heller et al., 2020). Similarly, insecticides used against plum 
curculio when it emerges from overwintering around petal fall, present another 
timing that is tricky in terms of pollinator protection, especially when there are 
adjacent blocks of different cultivars at various stages of bloom. Toxicological 
data is used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to 
determine pesticide risk in the registration of new pesticides and in the review 
of older pesticides in light of new data.
3.2 Apple diseases
Fungicides have been used in North American apple production during bloom 
for decades to protect plants from major diseases such as apple scab (Ventura 
inaequalis) and powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha). Failure to apply 
fungicides during the bloom infection period can lead to unmarketable fruit 
and/or greatly increased post-bloom applications when disease cycles are not 
disrupted at this critical time of the season (MacHardy, 1996; Turechek et al., 
2004; Peter et al., 2018). While toxicological data on adult honey bees exposed 
to fungicides generally allowed fungicides to be considered safe for use during 
bloom, the study of sublethal effects from fungicide exposure in honey bees 
providing pollination services is an active area of research.
Apple scab is a fungal disease whose spores overwinter in the fallen leaves 
from the previous season. In the spring, spores will be mature at the green tip 
developmental stage of apple and disperse when spring rains occur. If primary 
infections of the leaves are not prevented early and through bloom, secondary 
infections of the fruit will occur throughout the rest of the season which can 
cause complete crop loss through deformed and unsaleable fruit as well as 
causing severe defoliation (MacHardy, 1996; Gauthier et al., 2018; Crassweller 
et al., 2020). Of the many fungicide options registered for use in apple for early 
season prevention of apple scab, the plant systemic products Syllit FL (dodine) 
and Rally (myclobutanil) have been found in apple nectar and pollen from 
pre-bloom applications (Heller et al., 2020). Widespread resistance by apple 
scab to various fungicides has meant these products are important rotational 
partners as part of a resistance management program (FRAC, 2018; Biggs and 
Peter, 2019).
Powdery mildew is a dry-weather disease that does not need free-standing 
water or a significant number of hours of leaf wetness for infection to be 
triggered. The spores overwinter in dormant flower or leaf buds and disperse 
via wind in the early spring up through apple bloom to develop in young leaf 346 Best management practices for pollinator protection in US apple production

tissue. Primary infections occur from the tight cluster stage through the initiation 
of terminal shoots when temperatures range from 10°C to 25°C, and humidity 
is greater than 70%. These conditions are easily met in the micro-environment 
of the tree canopy in orchards (Turechek et al., 2004; Crassweller et al., 2020). 
Economic damage from powdery mildew is caused by reducing flower bud 
production and tree vigor. Myclobutanil is just one of the many options for 
early season management of powdery mildew with different modes of action 
alternated to prevent the formation of resistant fungal populations (Biggs and 
Peter, 2019).
4 Potential hazards to pollinators from apple pest 
management practices
Pollinators active in and around orchards, including managed bees hired for 
pollination services, have the potential to be negatively impacted by pesticide 
application (Heller et al., 2020; Belsky et al., 2022). However, there are some 
critical factors that may be overlooked which can minimize unintended 
exposures of bees to pesticides (Hooven et al., 2013). Within orchards, sources 
of exposure may include pesticide applications made in blocks not in bloom 
but which contain blooming weeds within the foraging range of hives or wild 
bee nests, and when systemic pesticides applied pre-bloom move through 
treated trees, ending up in nectar or pollen, later collected from those trees by 
foraging bees. Honey bees have a large foraging range, so pesticide exposure 
can also come from a wide variety of sources outside of the crop for which they 
were rented. Except for managing and mitigating drift, exposures from outside 
the crop are generally not something that either individual apple growers or 
beekeepers can control.
Bees also face potential hazards from pesticides within the hive. In honey 
bee hives, pesticides can build up in wax and stored pollen, including pesticides 
targeting control of Varroa mites. Residue exposure can be cumulative as hives 
are moved among various crops for their pollination services. Beekeepers who 
provide crop pollination services are advised to replace old frames with new 
frames annually to reduce this in-hive hazard.
Risks to bees from pesticides include those from insecticides, herbicides 
and fungicides, which are applied to crops via foliar sprays, soil applications or 
seed treatments (OPP, PMRA and CALDPR, 2014). There are two main routes 
of pesticide exposure for foraging bees: contact and ingestion. Foliar spray 
applications are commonly used in apple to control insects, mites, fungi, 
bacteria and other pests. The deposition of pesticides on plant surfaces (e.g. 
leaf, stem or flower) can directly contact foraging bees if they walk on these 
surfaces. Generally, growers do not spray contact insecticides during bloom to 
avoid contact exposure to bees, but fungicides, bactericides and plant growth © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

regulators are often applied during bloom under the assumption that they are 
not harmful to pollinators.
Since insecticides are not sprayed during apple bloom, bee exposure is 
almost completely through ingestion of systemic products applied pre-boom 
as they concentrate in nectar and pollen. Exposure to fungicides, however, 
can be from direct contact exposure if the flowers are sprayed during bloom, 
as fungicides often are, or from plant systemic movement of pre-bloom and 
bloom sprays.
Most systemic pesticides also have contact activity, which may be short￾lived depending on how quickly and to what extent they are absorbed into 
the crop tissues or degrade due to environmental exposure. In addition to 
their contact activity, systemic pesticides can be translocated to pollen or 
nectar via either xylem or phloem mobility (Sur and Stork, 2003; DeBoer and 
Satchivi, 2014; Bonmatin et al., 2015), providing exposure via the ingestion 
route. Systemic pesticides are also sheltered from environmental degradation 
such as weathering of surface residues to some extent by being in the plant 
tissues, and this can prolong their toxicity. During apple bloom, adult bees 
forage for and collect pollen and nectar as the main source of protein and 
energy.
Recently, it has been shown that fungicides can synergize insecticides if 
sprayed as mixtures leading to increased toxicity to pollinators, which results in 
a reduction of queen-rearing success and drastic decrease in forager survival for 
honey bees as well as disruption of nest recognition in solitary bees (Biddinger 
et al., 2013b; Johnson and Percel, 2013; Artz and Pitts-Singer, 2015; Fisher 
et al., 2017; Belsky et al., 2022). Fungicides alone can have adverse effects on 
the quality of bee colonies (Bernauer et al., 2015; Yoder et al., 2017), including 
higher incidence of diseases, reduction in worker productivity (in honey bees), 
smaller queens and less bee biomass (in bumble bees).
5 Best management practices to promote pollinators
Habitats containing flowers that are protected from pesticide drift benefit apple 
growers by providing additional forage (nectar and pollen) to pollinators. They 
can also provide nesting opportunities for wild pollinators. These habitats also 
provide food and refuge for agents of biological control – predators (e.g. hover 
flies, green lacewings, lady beetles) and parasitoids (tiny wasps that attack 
pests) that help suppress populations of apple insect pests. Depending on the 
region, different types of habitats can be planted or conserved to provide non￾crop flowering plants on the farm. When the crop is not in bloom, these habitats 
can also help divert bees from fruit plantings.
Woodlands are a habitat that can be conserved and provide nesting and 
spring flowers for wild bees important to orchard pollination in the Eastern 348 Best management practices for pollinator protection in US apple production

United States. Wildflower meadows (a.k.a. prairie style pollinator plantings) can 
be established in some regions to provide summer and fall blooming resources 
but require planning, patience and maintenance to implement. Mass-flowering, 
summer-blooming cover crops like sunflowers, canola, buckwheat, etc. may be 
a good fit where more permanent plantings are impractical. Intercropping or 
polyculture farming may be the best way to provide additional bee forage in 
some parts of the United States where water conservation limits the planting of 
pollinator habitat outside of orchards.
In each region of the United States, there are a variety of organizations and 
programs ready to help with the planning and implementation of pollinator 
habitats. Some of these programs offer cost-sharing incentives. These programs 
include:
• USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service and Farm Service Agency 
(e.g. Conservation Reserve Program, Conservation Stewardship Program, 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program);
• US Fish & Wildlife Service (e.g. Partners for Fish and Wildlife);
• Various state Department of Natural Resource incentive programs; and
• Non-profit or private groups (e.g. The Bee & Butterfly Habitat Fund, Project 
Wingspan, Pheasants Forever, The Xerces Society).
Developing pollinator habitats promotes both commercial and wild bee 
populations and the pollination services they supply.
When contracting with a beekeeper for pollination services, it is important 
to communicate expectations. Growers and beekeepers are strongly 
encouraged to clarify expectations through a written contract that includes 
plans for record keeping, when and how many hives will be delivered, where 
hives will be placed on the farm, when they will be removed, planned pesticide 
use and other conditions to provide for the health of the bees, including 
provision of clean water. There should be a meeting between the grower and 
the beekeeper prior to the spring bloom period to discuss the upcoming bee 
season. If the grower is not also the pesticide applicator, open communication 
between the grower, whoever is applying the pesticides and the beekeeper will 
be essential. Ultimately, growers are responsible for communicating with their 
pesticide applicator.
Growers/applicators should provide sufficient time between pre-bloom 
sprays and placement of the hives to avoid direct exposure and to ensure 
that beekeepers can adhere to restricted-entry intervals on pesticide labels 
when placing or removing hives from the orchard. Orchardists should give 
beekeepers as much advance notice as possible on placing and removing 
hives. Ideally, 1 week’s notice should be given for a prospective date of arrival 
and 2 days’ notice when the exact night of arrival is decided upon.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

It is also important to select a suitable location for hives on the farm. To 
minimize potential for pesticide drift reaching hives, select locations on the 
farm that are protected from wind, easy for the beekeeper to access and easy 
for the pesticide applicator to avoid when spraying. Honey bees are highly 
mobile, so hives do not need to be distributed throughout orchards. Set aside 
an area on the farm in a sunny location to enhance bee activity.
6 Best management practices: integrated pest and 
pollinator management
Integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM) is a sustainable, science￾based, decision-making process that combines scouting and multiple 
management tools (e.g. biological, cultural, physical, and chemical control) 
to identify, manage and reduce risk from pests in ways that minimize overall 
economic and environmental risk, while supporting human health. Pests are 
defined as any organism (microbes, plants or animals) that poses economic, 
health, aesthetic or environmental risk. Pests are context-specific, so an 
organism that is a pest in one environment may be benign or beneficial in 
others. Integrated pest management (IPM) practices are now an integral part of 
apple production systems, whether these production systems rely on synthetic 
or organically certified pesticides.
For many apple pests, weather-based or biologically predictive models are 
available and used to aid pathogen and insect pest management decisions. 
Successful implementation of these models requires IPM practitioners trained 
in their use and knowledgeable of economic or action thresholds specific to 
their commodities and production areas. Apple growers rely on a combination 
of information sources for pest management recommendations, including 
independent crop protection consultants and local extension specialists 
providing scouting reports and pest management guides. Examples of 
tools used in combination with predictive models include traps baited with 
semiochemicals, beat-tray samples, systematic scouting of plant tissues 
normally affected by target organisms, spore traps and remote sensing.
Pesticides are used in apple production to prevent, kill or suppress pest 
organisms from causing economic damage to the crop. Pesticides are selected 
according to many criteria, including their fit in a season-long IPPM program 
managing multiple co-occurring pests. Criteria include efficacy in suppressing 
different life stages of a pest (e.g. egg, larva and adult), cost, compatibility 
with biological control, regulatory restrictions on use related to target export 
markets, safety to farm workers, potential to harm non-target organisms and 
managing against pesticide resistance.
Growers also incorporate tactics to control pests such as biological control, 
pheromone-mediated mating disruption and other biorational practices 350 Best management practices for pollinator protection in US apple production

as options that may help reduce the need for other pesticide applications. 
Currently, some key apple insect pests, such as codling moth and oriental fruit 
moth, are effectively controlled with pheromone-mediated mating disruption 
as part of an IPM approach, with greater than 90% of apple orchards in the 
Western United States implementing this technology. The practice of mating 
disruption has reduced the need for companion insecticide sprays by 40–60% 
for the targeted insect.
Pesticides still play a crucial role in the management of apple pests. In the 
recent past, different strategies have been developed to mitigate potential 
non-target impacts of orchard pesticides. For instance, Biddinger and Rajotte 
(2015) proposed an IPPM approach that, with slight shifts in pesticide types 
and application timings, pests can be controlled without harming pollinators 
(Biddinger and Rajotte, 2015; Biddinger et al., 2018). Heller et  al. (2020) 
analyzed residue levels of commonly used orchard pesticides in apple nectar 
and pollen after pre-bloom applications using IPPM principles by using 
the QuEChERS procedure. The result showed that pesticide residue levels 
were 1000 to 10000 times lower compared with conventional pesticide 
concentrations applied to the plant surface and much lower than the lethal 
concentration of pesticide needed to kill 50% of a population (LC50) of honey 
bees (Hopwood et al., 2016; Shugrue, 2016). This knowledge provides the 
flexibility to modify pest management activities to favor pollinator health in an 
IPPM framework.
7 Best management practices for pesticide application
7.1 Regulations, labels and record keeping
Pesticide applicators are required by law to follow current product labels 
when applying pesticides. Pesticide labels can be found in a variety of places 
online, including the CDMS.net database (www.cdms.net). All new and recently 
updated pesticide labels are likely to contain mandatory and advisory language 
related to bee safety. This language can appear in multiple places within a 
single pesticide label, and may be accompanied by an icon of a bee to alert 
applicators of use restrictions related to pollinators. In addition, many state 
departments of agriculture maintain their own pesticide use requirements.
Growers and crop protection consultants should be knowledgeable of 
state and federal rules and regulations guiding pesticide applications. If not 
required by law in a particular state, keeping good records of all pesticide 
applications provides the applicator with the ability to demonstrate that 
applications were made according to the label if an issue arises. This can also 
provide a record to evaluate the efficacy or impacts of pesticide applications 
retroactively.© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

7.2 Pesticide selection and application timing
There are several regional guides available for advising growers and crop 
protection consultants on the selection of pesticides that are least toxic to bees 
and other beneficial insects. Important considerations include the following:
• Consider whether the insecticide or fungicide must be applied during 
bloom. Can it wait until bee colonies are removed from the orchard?
• When selecting from among pesticides permitted for use during crop 
bloom, give due consideration to pesticides that are least toxic to bees 
and other beneficial organisms. For example, for codling moth, granulosis 
virus products can be effective against the pest while having no effect on 
pollinators.
• Time applications to coincide with when bees are least active; most bees 
are less active in cool temperatures and low light, so spraying pesticides 
after sunset can greatly reduce the risk of direct exposure.
• Daytime applications when temperatures are expected to remain at 50°F 
or below will generally reduce risk of exposure. However, colony strength, 
food resource levels within hives and recent weather events that may have 
inhibited foraging all combine to influence bee flight activity, even under 
low temperature conditions.
• For night applications it is recommended to wait until bees have quit 
foraging before starting a spray application, with a stop time for spraying 
before 3:00 am to allow adequate time for the application to dry before 
bees begin to forage in the morning. The drying time for pesticides will 
differ depending on active ingredient and formulation. Check regional 
guides for more information.
• Above all, always apply the product according to the label.
7.3 Drift prevention and mitigation
Applicators should always think about spray drift prevention and mitigation. This 
starts with selection of the sprayer, orchard architecture, understanding how 
tractor application speed can impact deposition and knowing how to calibrate 
sprayers to maximize coverage and minimize loss to drift. When purchasing 
new sprayers, look for advances in sprayer technology that help make proper 
calibration or drift prevention easier to achieve, including consideration of 
electrostatic sprayers and tower sprayers that easily convert to accommodate 
different growing systems. Other considerations include the following:
• Applicators should be well-versed in how to maintain, modify and other￾wise calibrate sprayers to maximize spray deposition to the target site.352 Best management practices for pollinator protection in US apple production
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
• Good calibration tools are available (e.g. https://sprayers101. com/
orchardmax) as are calibration training workshops provided by land-grant 
university extension services and/ or state departments of agriculture in 
most regions.
• Wherever consistent with orchard architecture and topography, shields or 
diverters can be added to modify existing sprayers to maximize coverage 
and minimize drift.
• Orchard architecture, canopy density and physical and chemical properties 
of the pesticides and adjuvants will dictate the best combination of 
nozzles, pressures, gallonage and driving speed to maximize deposition 
and minimize drift.
• When actively spraying in an orchard, turn off the sprayer near hives and 
pollinator habitat; turn off nozzles directed out of the orchard in the outer 
row and end of rows.
• Avoid spraying under windy conditions and during temperature inversions. 
Many pesticide labels require that growers check for inversion layers in 
their area before spraying and some states (e.g. Washington) require 
recording such conditions in their spray records.
• Plant wind breaks where possible and maintain buffers between treated 
areas and hives or pollinator habitats.
7.4 Weed management
Non-crop flowering plants that invade orchard grass row middles and are 
attractive to bees can become sources of contaminated pollen and nectar. 
Some growers attach a mowing implement to their sprayer to cut flowering 
weeds as they apply pesticides to the crop. Selective herbicides may be used 
to suppress flowering forbs in orchards, but the best timing will depend on 
the chemical selected. If flowering habitat has been deliberately incorporated 
into orchard row middles, it will be important to apply pesticides that are least 
harmful to bees and when bees are not actively foraging.
7.5 Preventing contamination of open water
Honey bees consume large amounts of water for regulating in-hive temperatures. 
Contamination of open water sources may result in unintended exposures 
leading to bee poisoning. After applying pesticides, always clean equipment 
and dispose of pesticide products safely – do not leave contaminated water 
where bees can access it. Consider using/draining all waste water from pesticide 
fill sites daily to prevent bees from using waste water as a drinking source.
In addition, consider providing a source of clean water for bees within 
an orchard under a pollination contract. Test irrigation systems well before © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Best management practices for pollinator protection in US apple production 353
pollinators are scheduled to arrive to allow time to make any needed repairs 
and to provide dry conditions within the orchard, thereby reducing the chance 
of pollinators drinking compromised (contaminated) water.
Some states have voluntary programs to assist with siting and building 
pesticide storage facilities to prevent surface and groundwater contamination. 
One example is the Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program. 
Check for similar resources with your state department of agriculture.
7.6 Pest management at different crop stages
In this section we provide additional guidance on mitigating hazards to bees 
with respect to pest management at different crop stages.
• Pre-bloom to pink stage: when systemic pesticides are selected for use, 
consider restricting applications to the half-inch green developmental 
stage or selecting a non-systemic alternative, if an application is needed 
within 14 days before bloom. The pesticide label may include additional 
restrictions on use around bloom.
• During bloom: when selecting from among pesticides permitted for use 
during crop bloom, consider use of pesticides that are least toxic to bees 
and other beneficial organisms. Consider using biorational alternatives 
where effective and available (e.g. pheromone mating disruption).
• Petal fall: petal fall is the most challenging timing for insecticide use with 
respect to pollinators in orchards. It is common for blocks to be planted 
with mixed varieties for cross pollination, or for adjacent blocks to contain 
later blooming varieties. This can make it difficult to assess when petal fall 
has been achieved. Issues include the following:
º Individual pesticide labels may contain definitions of ‘petal fall’.
º Growers should work closely with beekeepers to coordinate hive 
removal.
º Drift prevention and mitigation will be critical with respect to adjacent 
blocks still in bloom or where bees are actively foraging.
º Consider use of pheromone mating disruption for key moth pests 
where available.
º Eliminating flowering broad-leaf weeds from orchards will both 
remove a source of potential pesticide exposure to pollinators and will 
reduce populations of disease vectoring insects active at this time (e.g. 
leafhoppers).
º When insecticide applications are used against key pests active at this 
time, consider insecticides with a short residual, and spray after sunset 
to minimize exposure to pollinators.354 Best management practices for pollinator protection in US apple production

• Fruit thinning: for materials that are labeled for use during petal fall for 
fruit thinning, be aware of bee activity in orchards and consider applying 
thinners in the evening once the bees have stopped foraging for the night.
• Remainder of the season through harvest: continue practices that 
prevent or mitigate spray drift on flowering plants in orchard row middles 
and adjacent habitats.

Entomovectoring: using pollinators 
to spread biocontrol agents

1 Introduction
Plants and insects have co-evolved in a mutually beneficial relationship for 
pollination. Ollerton et  al. (2011) consider plant–pollinator relationships to 
be one of the most ecologically and economically important relationships on 
Earth as 75% of the world’s major food crops show increased fruit and/or seed 
set as a result of animal pollination. Important pollinators include butterflies, 
beetles, flies, bats, and moths, but the vast majority of pollination is done by 
bees (Halder et al., 2019). In the greenhouse, pollination by wild pollinators 
is generally not feasible. Commercially available pollinators are then used to 
obtain a reasonable fruit set in sheltered cultivation (Guerra-Sanz, 2008). For 
the strawberry plant, for example, the most important commercially used 
pollinators in sheltered cultivation are the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the 
bumblebee (Bombus spp.) (Abrol et al., 2019; Paydas et al., 1998; Zaitoun et al., 
2006).
Insects such as the honeybee and the bumblebee are known pollinators 
and have the capacity to carry small particles (such as pollen) from plant to plant 
(Mommaerts et al., 2010; Wael et al., 1990). These pollinators can also transport

agents
bacterial cells and fungal spores from flower to flower (Mommaerts et al., 2010). 
It is the combination of a pollination service and the use of the pollinators as 
vectors for the transport of beneficial organisms such as biocontrol agents 
(BCAs) to combat plant pathogens, which gave rise to the entomovectoring 
system. In the system, the pollinators fulfill an important dual role of pollination 
and crop protection (Mommaerts and Smagghe, 2011).
In this chapter, we review the most important factors for successful 
entomovectoring. Several previous applications of the entomovectoring 
technology using two commercially used bumblebee species, Bombus terrestris
and Bombus impatiens, will be discussed. Finally, we will present a case study 
focusing on vectoring bacterial BCAs using bumblebees to combat Botrytis 
cinerea, the causal agent of gray mold, a commonly feared plant pathogen on 
strawberry.
2 Factors important for successful entomovectoring
The term ‘entomovectoring technology’ was introduced by Hokkanen and 
Menzler-Hokkanen (2007) indicating the use of pollinators as disseminators 
of BCAs against plant pathogens (Kevan et al., 2020). However, other terms 
such as apivectoring or bee vectoring are used as well (Coates et al., 2019). 
Nowadays there are companies such as Biobest (Belgium), Bee Vectoring 
Technology (Canada), and Assatek (Finland) which have developed business 
models based on entomovectoring technology. Entomovectoring has several 
advantages over conventional applications of BCAs, such as spraying. Among 
others, it guarantees that the BCAs will be applied to the flowers from the 
moment they open (Karise et al., 2016). This is important as, in many cases, 
the flowers are the main target of infection (Bristow et al., 1986; Mommaerts 
and Smagghe, 2011). This transport to the target location is also much more 
efficient than spraying the BCA because biocontrol organisms will not be lost 
to the surrounding plant tissue and soil to such a large extent (Smagghe et al., 
2012). However, when using an entomovectoring system, not only the flowers 
but also the leaves can be protected with BCAs. For example, Kapongo et al. 
(2008a) reported that 90% of the leaves of the tomato plant and 76% of the 
leaves of the bell pepper plant contained the fungal biocontrol organism 
Clonostachys rosea after entomovectoring with Bombus impatiens inside a 
greenhouse. In addition, each flower is subjected to several visits, which implies 
the continuous application of the biocontrol organisms directly onto the flower 
(Macedo et al., 2020). Furthermore, entomovectoring requires less inoculum, 
decreases the need for external inputs such as energy, chemicals, and water, 
reduces the cost and labor, and minimizes non-target organisms exposure 
(Macedo et al., 2020). This also fits within the framework of the European Green 
Deal in which the European Commission aims to reduce net greenhouse © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to overcome climate change and 
environmental degradation (https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019
-2024/european-green-deal_en).
The success of entomovectoring depends on its various components 
and their interactions. A suitable vector, BCA, formulation, dispenser, and 
the guarantee of safety for the environment, vector, and human health are all 
important factors (Fig. 1) (Mommaerts and Smagghe, 2011).
2.1 The vector
The number of insect species that have been used as vectors in entomovectoring 
systems is quite limited because most insects are only commercially available 
for a limited part of the year. As a consequence, the entomovectoring system 
cannot always be optimally synchronized with the flowering period of the 
plant needing protection (Mommaerts and Smagghe, 2011). Honeybees 
and bumblebees that are commercially available throughout the year are

therefore a very popular choice for use and have been the vectors in many 
scientific investigations of entomovectoring (Kevan et al., 2020). Commercially, 
honeybees (Apis mellifera) (Fig. 2c) have been used in North America, Europe, 
South America, and Asia (Kevan et al., 2020; Kovach et al., 2000; Kapongo 
et al., 2008b). Bumblebees have been successfully deployed in North 
America (Bombus impatiens) (Fig. 2b), Europe (Bombus terrestris) (Fig. 2a) 
and Korea (Bombus terrestris) (Karise et al., 2016; Kevan et al., 2020; Kovach 
et al., 2000). Other important reasons for using bumblebees, aside from their 
commercial availability, are their morphological and behavioral characteristics. 
Bumblebees, whose bodies are covered with branched hairs in large part, can 
trap and transport pollen grains and thus also BCAs easily (Mänd et al., 2020).
When choosing between honeybees and bumblebees, the conditions 
under which entomovectoring is occurring have to be considered. Greenhouses 
without temperature control are prone to temperature fluctuations as a result of 
Figure 2  Detail of important pollinators: (a) the buff-tailed bumblebee or large earth

honeybee Apis mellifera (De la Rúa et al., 2014).© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

refracted sunlight on the glass of the greenhouse. Honeybees are less suitable 
for flying under greenhouse conditions and bumblebees are often the vector 
of choice because they can tolerate temperature extremes better and are more 
resistant to temperature fluctuations than are honeybees (Goulson, 2010; 
Mommaerts et al., 2011). Bumblebees also have a better vision than honeybees, 
which gives them a navigational advantage in a greenhouse (Guerra-Sanz, 
2008). Another important advantage that bumblebees have over honeybees 
is that they perform buzz pollination, a very efficient pollination technique 
in which the flower stamens are shaken intensively by the vibrating wings of 
the insect, resulting in the formation of a cloud of pollen grains (Corbet et al., 
1988). Buzz pollination is critical for the pollination success of some crops such 
as tomatoes and blueberries (Goulson, 2010; Guerra-Sanz, 2008).
The choice of a particular vector and more specifically its health play a 
role in the choice of the BCA. It is important that the BCA does not exert any 
adverse effects on the vector or on surrounding non-target organisms for which 
the biocontrol is not intended (Kevan et al., 2008). Examples of commercially 
available products that are already considered safe for Bombus terrestris
are Binab-T-vector, a 50/50 mixture of Trichoderma atroviride and Hypocrea 
parapilulifera, and Prestop-Mix with Gliocladium catenulatum as its active 
component (Mommaerts et al., 2010).
2.2 The dispenser
A crucial step in the vectoring of BCAs by pollinators is to load the vector in an 
efficient manner to ensure sufficient dispersal of the BCA (Maccagnani et al., 
2020). To achieve this, designing a suitable dispenser, a device loaded with 
the BCA in powder form through which the vectors have to walk in order to 
leave the hive, is essential (Mänd et al., 2020). A good dispenser should apply 
sufficient powdery BCA to the vector, be safe for the insect, have no or as little 
effect as possible on the foraging of the vector in question, and the refilling 
interval should be as long as possible (preferably greater than 1 day) (Smagghe 
et al., 2012). The two basic models available are the one-way dispenser where 
the entrance and exit of the dispenser are in the same space and the two-way 
dispenser where the exit and entrance are separated. The latter has proven to be 
the most suitable dispenser in terms of applying BCA to both bumblebees and 
honeybees, its effect on the foraging behavior of the bee vectors, and the time 
interval between dispenser recharging (Smagghe et al., 2012). Furthermore, 
from a practical point of view, complexity, cost of construction, and ease of use 
should be considered as well (Mommaerts et al., 2010).
The data as far available on the compatibility of dispensers with bumblebees 
are rather limited (see review by Maccagnani et al. (2020)). Yu and Sutton (1997) 
conducted the first dispenser study with bumblebees (Bombus impatiens), 364 Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents

showing that Bombus impatiens could be loaded with BCAs to the same extent 
as Apis mellifera. Dispenser designs include the Houle dispenser (Albano et al., 
2009), the one-way side-by-side passageway (Maccagnani et al., 2005) and 
the two-way overlapping passageway developed for entomovectoring with 
Bombus terrestris by Maccagnani et  al. (2005). Dispenser designs generally 
lack information about their effect on induced grooming by the vectors upon 
contact with the powdery BCA product or their effect on foraging activity, 
although both of these might affect the ability of the vectors to disseminate the 
inoculum to the target crops (Maccagnani et al., 2020).
Mommaerts et  al. (2010) developed another dispenser specifically for 
Bombus terrestris (Fig. 3a). This system achieved a load of Prestop-Mix (with 
the fungal BCA Gliocladium catenulatum) of 104 CFU per bumblebee worker. 
Unlike the one-way side-by-side passageway dispenser, it did not have any 
effect on the insect’s foraging, with no significant effect on the number of 
bumblebees leaving the hives. In greenhouse experiments with strawberry 
plants, Mommaerts et al. (2010) found that, after the bumblebees had fledged, 
approximately 100 CFU per flower of the strawberry plant was detected after a 
single flight. Karise et al. (2016) used this dispenser developed by Mommaerts 
et al. (2010) in which Bombus terrestris loaded with Prestop-Mix successfully

suppressed the plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea on the strawberry plant. In good 
weather conditions, the number of infected flowers was reduced 2.9 times in 
the first year and 1.7 times in the second year. Furthermore, Mommaerts et al. 
(2011) have successfully used this dispenser in the greenhouse to combat 
Botrytis cinerea in strawberry plants with Bombus terrestris and Prestop-Mix. 
Here, the total yield (pre- and post-harvest) increased 2–2.5 fold compared to 
the control.
Finally, the Flying Doctors® hive (Fig. 3b) is a patented and commercially 
available nest for vectoring using Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens
with an integrated dispenser based on the previously described dispenser 
developed by Mommaerts et  al. (2010). The workers can leave the hive by 
walking through a tray that can be loaded with the powdery BCA. After 
disseminating the BCA on the target crop, the bees can return to the hive 
through a separate entrance.
Compared to dispensers for bumblebees, the first dispensers for 
honeybees were already developed in the 1950s (Maccagnani et al., 2020). 
These dispensers were used to load the vector with pollen in order to obtain 
cross-pollination. However, these devices were unfit for biological control 
due to an insufficient loading as reviewed by Maccagnani et al. (2020). Peng 
et al. (1992) were the first to develop a honeybee dispenser fit for biological 
control. The authors used the dispenser to transport the fungus Gliocladium 
catenulatum to combat Botrytis cinerea on the strawberry plant. The Gross￾dispenser (Gross et al., 1994), the Triwaks dispenser (Bilu et al., 2004), and the 
Houle dispenser (Albano et al., 2009) followed. Furthermore, one commercially 
available honeybee dispenser, BeeTreat, has been developed and was 
described by Smagghe et al. (2012). This dispenser was shown to successfully 
load honeybees with Gliocladium catenulatum for the control of Botrytis cinerea
on strawberry (Hokkanen et al., 2015).
Unfortunately, no thorough scientific comparison between these different 
dispensers has been made. In order to further optimize entomovectoring by 
honeybees, a scientific comparative study between all available dispensers 
would be necessary and very useful (Maccagnani et al., 2020).
Solitary bees, unlike social bees, build their own nest and raise their own 
progeny, and can be used for the dissemination of BCAs as well (Maccagnani 
and Sgolastra, 2020). However, because the dispenser has to be integrated 
in the shelter, this is limited to those species that nest in preexisting cavities 
and exhibit some properties of social behavior (Maccagnani et al., 2020). 
Maccagnani et al. (2006) were first to develop a dispenser for Osmia cornuta
to vector Bacillus subtilis BS-F4 for the control of fire blight on pear (Pyrus 
communis; cultivar Abbé Fétel). The number of BCAs per vector of Osmia 
cornuta ranged between 104 and 107 CFU/bee (Maccagnani et al., 2006). 
However, the dispenser was not ideal as after a time, bees learned to exit the 366 Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents

dispenser without passing through the powdery BCA formulation. Maccagnani 
et al. (2008) later successfully increased the dispenser’s efficiency by, among 
other modifications, relocating the dispenser towards a higher part of the 
shelter.
2.3 The biocontrol agent product
Various microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, and fungi have been 
suggested as possible microbial BCAs, and at least a dozen have already 
been tested (reviewed by Kevan et al., 2020). Typically, the products used 
in entomovectoring studies are powdery BCA formulations available as 
commercial products (Mommaerts and Smagghe, 2011). In order to obtain a 
cost-effective, maximal dispersibility and dosage onto the plant, BCAs are often 
diluted (Kevan et al., 2008). The main purpose of these formulation products 
or carriers is to reduce the loss of BCA powder in flight (Mommaerts and 
Smagghe, 2011). The carriers used can be divided into mineral (talc and clays) 
and vegetable (flours and starch) materials (Kevan et al., 2020). The vegetable 
carriers have proven to work especially well under laboratory and experimental 
conditions (Kevan et al., 2008).
For example, Mommaerts et al. (2011) used a mixture of Prestop-Mix and 
corn starch (Maizena) together with Bombus terrestris in strawberry plants to 
combat Botrytis cinerea. The authors observed that the use of Maizena led to 
an equally efficient dissemination of the BCA into the flowers with only half the 
initial concentration of Prestop-Mix (Mommaerts et al., 2011). Furthermore, this 
mixture had no significant effect on the foraging behavior of the bumblebees 
(Mommaerts et al., 2011).
Commercial formulations have to meet several criteria. First of all, they 
have to adhere effectively to the vector’s body and dislodge when pollination of 
the target flower occurs. Second, they should have no effect on the behavioral 
characteristics (e.g. foraging or grooming) of the vector or cause any health 
problems whatsoever (Kevan et al., 2020). Furthermore, it is important that 
they are food grade, easily available, inexpensive, and safe (Mommaerts and 
Smagghe, 2011). Finally, they should remain as dry and accessible as possible 
inside the dispensers and be readily applicable by beekeepers and growers.
2.4 Biosafety
In order to assure that entomovectoring technology is safe for use in the human 
food supply chain, safe for growers to use, safe for the cultivated crops, and has 
no or minimal environmental effects, environmental safety and registration must 
be assessed (Kevan et al., 2020). This implies that an environmental and human 
risk assessment is required before BCAs can be used with this technology © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents 367
(Kevan et al., 2008). Often, the registration period for microbial pesticides is 
shorter than the one for conventional pesticides (McVey and Wassenberg, 
2020).
Besides human health, the health of non-target organisms such as the 
vector transporting the BCAs needs to be safeguarded as well. According to 
Mommaerts and Smagghe (2011), there are three levels at which side effects of 
the vector need to be assessed including acute and chronic mortality, sublethal 
effects on worker and nest reproduction, and effects on pollinator foraging 
behavior. As mentioned above, a wide variety of BCAs have been suggested; 
however, tests on safety of those agents to pollinators vary from very thorough 
to completely absent (Kevan et al., 2020).
Mommaerts et  al. (2012) developed a laboratory miniature-dispenser￾based bioassay to screen for lethal and sublethal effects. Using this bioassay 
system, the authors found that the carrier kaolin was toxic for Bombus terrestris. 
Using a one-way dispenser, mortality of over 70% was observed after 5 weeks 
of exposing the bee to the carrier. In addition, it was shown that kaolin had 
a significant negative effect on the vector’s reproductive abilities when nests 
were exposed to the carrier (Mommaerts et al., 2012). During the same 
experiments, cellulose and wheat flour had no significant effects on the viability 
of the workers (Mommaerts et al., 2012).
Thus far, very few BCAs have been tested on their effect on pollen viability 
and germination rate, embryogenesis, and seed set (Kevan et al., 2020). 
However, Ngugi et al. (2005) attempted to investigate the adverse effects of 
applying Serenade® with Bacillus subtilis as active bacteria BCA to suppress 
floral infection by Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi on blueberry. Application of 
Serenade on detached blueberry flowers had no effect on the number of pollen 
tubes or their growth rates. When honeybees were utilized to vector Serenade 
to open flowers, the fruit weight was not significantly altered. However, the fruit 
set was significantly reduced from 49.1% to 38.1% and the number of seeds 
was halved (Ngugi et al., 2005). Nonetheless, even in treatments receiving no 
Serenade, the fruit weight and number of seeds were already low, indicative 
of poor pollination overall (Ngugi et al., 2005). The authors concluded that the 
use of Serenade® had no inherently adverse effects but that caution should be 
applied when using this product in circumstances otherwise unfavorable for 
pollination.
3 Examples of bumblebees as vectors for 
entomovectoring: successes and failures
Honeybees or bumblebees have been used as vectors for biocontrol for more 
than 25 years. One of the first comprehensive studies was one by Peng et al. 
(1992) in which the BCA Gliocladium roseum was delivered by honeybees 368 Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents

to the flowers of the strawberry plant to control Botrytis cinerea. Since then, 
several studies using bumblebees have been conducted (Table 1).
Kapongo et al. (2008b) demonstrated how a mix of the fungi Clonostachys 
rosea and Beauveria bassiana  transported by Bombus impatiens reduced 
Botrytis cinerea infection by 57% and 46%, respectively, in the flowers and 
leaves of the tomato plant and by 59% and 47%, respectively, in the flowers 
and leaves of the sweet pepper. Kovach et al. (2000) investigated the use of 
both honeybees and bumblebees compared to spraying for the transmission 
of the fungus Trichoderma harzianum on the strawberry plants in open fields. 
The authors found that despite the lower concentration of Trichoderma 
harzianum on the flowers using the entomovectoring system, entomovectoring 
still resulted in a better biocontrol than the more conventional spraying. The 
authors credited this to the more targeted application of the BCA at the 
appropriate time and place where needed, (i.e. when the flowers open). The 
spraying of Trichoderma harzianum was done before all flowers had opened, 
whereas the vectors flew continuously with an almost immediate protection 
of all flowers at opening as a result. Furthermore, when making use of the 
insects as a vector, the strawberries contained on average 22% more seeds 
resulting in a yield increase of 26–40% by weight (Kovach et al., 2000). When 
using the entomovectoring system with Trichoderma harzianum, both the level 
of control and the yield were at least as good or better compared to the use 
of commercial fungicides plus pollination (Kovach et al., 2000). The authors 
believed that the chemical fungicides (including captan, iprodione, benomyl, 
and vinclozolin) had a negative effect on pollination, resulting in fewer seeds 
and therefore a lower yield. Mommaerts et al. (2011) performed a study, using 
the previously described Mommaerts dispenser, Prestop-Mix, and the vector 
Bombus terrestris to combat Botrytis cinerea under greenhouse conditions. 
The authors observed that the use of this BCA and vector (in combination 
with Maizena as a formulation product) could provide a significantly higher 
yield compared to the control group without biocontrol organisms, even 
under conditions that were considered ideal for the fungus. The authors 
also found that the powder had no effect on the vector’s foraging. Karise 
et  al. (2016) observed that the weather conditions clearly influenced the 
proper functioning of Prestop-Mix transported by Bombus terrestris in the 
open field. The incidence of Botrytis cinerea was strongly reduced in good 
weather conditions, but the biocontrol was substandard during very rainy 
periods. Another important conclusion from these different experiments was 
that the use of Bombus terrestris resulted in a similar biocontrol of Botrytis 
cinerea compared to the honeybee Apis mellifera. Albano et al. (2009) tested 
the disseminating of the biofungicide Rootshield® with active component 
Trichoderma harzianum to strawberry plants in the field, using Apis mellifera, 
and in the greenhouse, using Bombus impatiens. The authors examined © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

the transmission of the powder from the Houle dispenser to the vector 
and by extension from the vector to the strawberry crops. They found that 
both honeybees and bumblebees were capable of dispersing the powder. 
However, no data were reported on the level of disease control (Albano et al., 
2009).
Terzić et  al. (2020) investigated entomovectoring with Bombus terrestris
and Clonostachys rosea for the protection of sunflowers (Helianthus annuus), 
an important crop cultivated for oil, bird seed, and improved seed stock, 
against the pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the causal agent of head rot. 
During the experiments, the authors observed that the BCA Clonostachys rosea
affected the behavior of the bumblebees who actively avoided going through 
the biocontrol powder (Terzić et al., 2020). Decreased foraging of Bombus 
terrestris in the presence of Clonostachys rosea was observed as well. Despite 
these difficulties, the entomovectoring system managed to reduce the disease 
incidence (on average 2%, 13%, and 57% compared to 6%, 26%, and 68% in 
the controls) (Terzić et al., 2020). Although the presence of Sclerotinia was not 
significantly lower, the negative effects on the plant itself were significantly 
reduced by the entomovectoring system as the yield of the treated plants was 
on average 25% higher than in the control (Terzić et al., 2020).
4 Case study: entomovectoring of bacteria by Bombus 
terrestris against Botrytis cinerea in strawberry
An important goal of our own ongoing research is to find BCAs as alternatives 
for the spraying of chemical fungicides to combat Botrytis cinerea on the 
strawberry plant. For this, we have used Bombus terrestris as the vector for the 
transfer of different bacteria selected based on their in vitro inhibitory effect 
against Botrytis cinerea.
4.1 Strawberry production and the importance of Botrytis 
cinerea
According to Debode et  al. (2013), strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) can be 
considered one of the most widely cultivated small fruit crops on a global scale 
with a worldwide cultivation of more than 350,000 ha and fruit production 
estimated at 8.3 million tons (FAO, 2018).
Fungal diseases in strawberry may be responsible for heavy economic 
losses in this crop (Debode et al., 2013). For example, the fungus Botrytis 
cinerea, the causal agent of gray mold, is the most common reason for fruit loss 
causing crop losses of 20–25% among European strawberry growers (European 
Commission, 2013) and further losses during shipping, storage, and retail, and 
for end consumers (Abbey et al., 2018; Dean et al., 2012). Botrytis can cause © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents 371
both quantitative losses (reduced yield) and qualitative damage, such as an 
inferior taste or smell (Fillinger and Elad, 2015).
 Botrytis cinerea is capable of infecting all above-ground parts of the 
plant including, for example, flowers, leaves, and shoots (Cota et al., 2008). 
However, the most damaging infections occur during the flowering of the host 
plant where infection often starts on the petals, stamens, and pistils and can 
subsequently colonize the fruit via the ovary (Cota et al., 2008). Therefore, to 
prevent infection, it is of utmost importance that treatment methods are timed 
to coincide with new flower budding (Departement Landbouw and Visserij, 
2015; Smagghe, 2020). Although infection of the fruit occurs in the field, often 
symptoms will not be noticed until the strawberries ripen and the fungus begins 
to form spores (Bristow et al., 1986).
4.2 Control of Botrytis cinerea
At present, Botrytis cinerea is still mainly controlled by chemical fungicides 
applied to the plants both before and after harvest (Petrasch et al., 2019; 
Wedge et al., 2007). There is no question that fungicides have improved 
disease control, crop quality, and economic opportunities (Ragsdale and 
Alford, 1991). However, recently consumers are demanding a reduction in the 
amounts of fungicides present on the fruit and used during its production 
(Debode et al., 2013; Sams, 2018). There has also been an increasing legislative 
pressure to shift towards more environmentally friendly alternatives (https://ec
.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en) by 
reducing the number of registered authorized active components (European 
Parliament and the Council, 2021; FOD, 2020). Several active components are 
no longer sold or have lost their registration for use on the strawberry plant 
in North America (https://www.epa.gov/) (https://www.canada.ca/en/health
-canada/services/consumer-product-safety/pesticides-pest-management
.html). In Europe, a similar trend has been taking place (FOD, 2020; Wedge 
et al., 2007), with iprodione and thiram having lost their registration in Europe 
for use on strawberry for combating Botrytis cinerea in 2017 and 2018, 
respectively.
Limiting the use of chemical fungicides is important to prevent deleterious 
and often lethal effects on beneficial insects and fungi (Budi et al., 2000). 
For example, chitosan may cause modifications in the cell walls of Fusarium 
oxysporum, a ubiquitous soil-bound fungus known for the degradation of 
lignin (Sutherland et al., 1983). Cyproconazole, in turn, can affect the cell 
viability of Athelia rolfsii, a saprotrophic but facultatively pathogenic soil fungus 
(Budi et al., 2000). Besides effects on beneficial fungi, the fungicides captan, 
thiophanate methyl, and benomyl can have a negative effect on the ability of 
pollen to germinate, resulting in a lower strawberry yield (Kovach et al., 2000).372 Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents
© Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Reducing chemical fungicide use can also mitigate fungal resistance to 
available fungicides and reduce fungicidal residues on the fruit, thus protecting 
human health (Fillinger and Elad, 2015).
The increase in resistance to chemical fungicides displayed by pathogens 
is another recurrent problem associated with fungicide use (Dean et al., 2012; 
Fillinger and Elad, 2015; Mommaerts et al., 2011; Petrasch et al., 2019; Wedge 
et al., 2007). Botrytis cinerea is designated as a high-risk pathogen by the 
Fungicide Resistance Action Committee because of its wide genetic variability, 
adaptation skills, and resistance. By modifying the target molecules on which 
the fungicides act and by actively transporting fungicides outwardly, Botrytis 
cinerea can develop resistance to several antimicrobial agents simultaneously 
(Fillinger and Elad, 2015). An increasing number of both in vitro and in situ
tests indicate an increased resistance in Botrytis spp. for, among others, methyl 
benzimidazole carbamate-generating components (benomyl, carbendazim, 
and thiophanate-methyl) and the dicarboximides (vinclozolin and iprodione) 
(Wedge et al., 2007). As early as 1984, Barak and Edgington (1984) demonstrated 
significant resistance to the active components captan, folpet, captafol, etem, 
thiram, and chlorothalonil.
Fungal resistance combined with increased environmental concerns, 
continued consumer demand, and more stringent policies in many countries 
have increased the need for alternatives to fungicides. To this end, the European 
Commission has issued a directive to encourage integrated pest management 
(European Commission, 2021). This implies the integration of measures that 
combat pathogenic organisms and keeps the use of chemical protection 
products and other interventions to an economically and ecologically justified 
level. Part of this strategy is to preferentially use sustainable biological methods 
over chemical methods if they can sufficiently protect the plant (European 
Commission, 2021). Within an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) framework, 
bacterial BCAs are a promising alternative.
4.3 Measuring acquisition of viable bacterial biocontrol agents 
on workers of Bombus terrestris
To evaluate the viability, loading, and dispersal of potential bacterial BCAs onto 
bumblebees (Bombus terrestris; Biobest, Westerlo, Belgium) to control Botrytis 
cinerea, we used a dry bacterial formulation placed into a dispenser (Fig. 4a,b). 
To load the bumblebees, the bacterial formulation was mixed with corn starch 
(Maizena) (Carrefour, Belgium) in a 1:10 ratio by weight. Because it mimics pollen, 
Maizena can facilitate the loading of the bacteria onto the bee vector to reduce 
the loss of bacterial spores during flight towards the strawberry plant (Smagghe 
et al., 2012). Diluting and mixing the bacteria with Maizena minimally affected the 
viability of the BCA and bacterial loading occurred on 73% of the bees coming © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents 373
in contact with the BCA–Maizena mixture in the dispenser. As the bumblebees 
passed through the dispenser, their hairy legs, thorax, and abdomen were 
loaded with the bacterial powder (Fig. 4c). This is in agreement with the findings 
of Mommaerts et  al. (2010) for Bombus terrestris who identified the thorax, 
abdomen, and legs as the main loading sites with Gliocladium catenulatum.
However, the bacterial load on the bumblebee workers was quite variable. 
This can partly be explained by the imperfect mixing of the bacterial formulation, 
Figure 4  (a) Overview experimental setup with miniature dispenser (length = 20 cm). 
Bombus terrestris was collected in a dark 50 mL tube (left side of the dispenser) and, 
attracted by a light source, captured on the opposite side. (b) Detail inside dispenser filled 
with 1:10 bacteria with Maizena. (c) Bumblebee worker (Bombus terrestris) exiting the 
dispenser, loaded with 1:10 bacterial formulation. After passage through the dispenser, 
the worker was captured, washed using leaf washing buffer (LWB), and subsequently 
plated out. Plating method: 10 µL of a 1 mg/mL suspension of the 1:10 bacterial 
formulation was plated in triplicate on selective agar plates containing cycloheximide 
(0.1 g/L) in a dilution series. CFUs were counted in the countable dilution.374 Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents

but also by the walking path of the bees through the powder formulation inside 
the dispenser. Furthermore, not all bumblebees stayed in the dispenser for the 
same amount of time, which could result in higher loading with the bacterial mix 
for those individuals that remained in the dispenser longer. The bumblebees 
also differed in size; thus, the potential surface area available for acquisition 
with the bacterial powder varied among individuals. Finally, storage at 4°C of 
the bacterial formulation appeared to have an influence on the acquisition by 
the bumblebees because the powder was hygroscopic and became clumpy. 
The change in texture could not only lead to a negative effect on the acquisition 
by the bumblebees (Fig. 4c) but also lead to a decrease in the viability of the 
BCA.
4.4 Transport of bacterial biocontrol agent to strawberry plants 
in a single visit
After observing that bacteria could consistently be loaded on Bombus terrestris, 
we evaluated the amount of bacterial transfer from the dispenser to the flowers 
of strawberry in a single visit using a mass balance approach that measured 
the amount of BCA that was picked up by the bee (Bombus terrestris) from the 
dispenser, the amount of BCA that was lost in flight, and the amount of BCA that 
was deposited onto the flower
After releasing the bumblebees but before adding the bacterial formulation 
to the dispenser, three random flowers, the blanks, were cut off and transferred 
into a sterile 50 mL tube. Next, a dispenser containing 1:10 bacterial mixture 
with Maizena was attached to the hive. Subsequently, a bumblebee worker 
passed through, flew, and landed on the plants (Fig. 5c). Both the pollinated 
flower (Fig. 6d) and the bumblebee were collected individually in a sterile 50 
mL tube and kept refrigerated for transportation to the lab (Fig. 5e).
In total, four different bumblebees were captured using tweezers and 
subsequently passed through the dispenser filled with freshly mixed bacterial 
formulation. Subsequently, all bumblebees flew towards a first and single flower 
of one of the three strawberry plants (Fig. 5a). Bacterial powder was present 
between the hairs of the bumblebee after passing through the dispenser 
(Fig. 5c). Following the capture of the bumblebee, in some cases, traces of the 
white powder could also be observed on the flower (Fig. 5d).
By plating out on a selective medium, no loading with bacteria could be 
detected on the three blank flowers cut before the start of the experiment, 
showing that no background bacteria were present. Thus, it can be assumed 
that all bacteria encountered on the flowers were in fact the result of 
entomovectoring with Bombus terrestris. The four flowers that were visited first 
by one of the bumblebees were all significantly loaded with bacteria. After 
visiting a flower, the bumblebees were recaptured and evaluated showing that © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.
Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents 375
the number of CFU on these bumblebees varied relatively greatly. The reasons 
for this variability can be of various origins. First, as previously described, there 
is variation in bacterial acquisition on the bumblebees exiting the dispenser. 
Some bumblebees flew longer or even displayed grooming behavior before 
flying towards the plant, which likely resulted in a lower load. It should also 
be noted that catching the bumblebees with tweezers is a stressor for these 
insects, making them less likely to prioritize visiting a plant. Furthermore, it was 
observed that for two bumblebees, after capture, bacterial loads were lower 
than the loads on the flower they visited, implying that the bumblebees in 
question had left most of their initial payload on the plant and/or had lost it in 
flight.
4.5 Transport of biocontrol agent by vectors over 4 days
After having determined the loading of a strawberry flower as a result of a 
single flight, we mapped the loading and hence the potential protection of the 
Figure 5  Greenhouse experiment with strawberry plants: transport of bacteria during 
single first flight (a) Overview of experimental greenhouse (4 × 3 m) with strawberry plants. 
(b) One representative plot of six strawberry plants. (c) Worker of Bombus terrestris with

plant from the plant’s point of view over a 4-day entomovectoring period. We 
measured whether all flowers were loaded and to what extent the loading and 
thus the potential protection was homogeneously distributed.
Figure 6a provides an overview of the experimental design: the grower, 
cultivar, and location were the same as described during the previous 
experiment as presented in Fig. 5. For 4 days, bumblebees were able to 
pollinate the flowers at any time (Fig. 6c). The dispenser of a Flying Doctors 
hive was daily replenished with 1:10 bacterial mixture with Maizena (Fig. 6b).

Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents 377
At 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after filling the platform for the first time, 
6–16 of the open flowers were collected for a total of 37 collected flowers 
representing 30–50% of the entire flower population present (determined on 
a visual basis). Before filling the platform for the first time, three flowers were 
collected as blanks.
Bacteria were detectable in all collected flowers at every time point, and 
all flowers sampled had significantly higher loadings than the three blanks. 
However, it should be noted that the current experiment was carried out on a 
small scale, so it is uncertain how these results would translate to a larger scale.
In contrast to the results of the experiment after a single flight (see above), 
the loaded flowers in this experiment may have been visited repeatedly by 
more than one bee and/or by bees visiting consecutive flowers during a single 
flight. Furthermore, the survival of the BCA is accounted for better over the 
longer term. The average load on strawberries after 4 days of entomovectoring 
was approximately 1.14% of the initial load after a single flight. One explanation 
for this decrease over time is a decrease in the viability of bacteria on the 
phyllosphere as well as inside the dispenser due to external stressors such as 
drought stress. Another important potential cause is redistribution. This implies 
that during the time period of the experiment, the bacteria were redistributed 
from flower to flower by bumblebees visiting different flowers sequentially. This 
is a very important fact, especially on a commercial scale, as on that scale not all 
flowers would be first in line to be visited by a bumblebee right after leaving the 
dispenser. This immediately shows the power of the entomovectoring system 
to distribute a homogeneous load of BCA to flowers in an efficient manner.
The obtained results show the extent and consistency with which bacteria 
are deposited on the flowers of Fragaria × ananassa by Bombus terrestris
are promising. These results prompt us to think about the next step, that of 
carrying out the experiments on a larger scale to ensure that results apply to the 
commercial production context, either in the greenhouse or in the field.
5 Conclusion and future trends
Entomovectoring has shown much promise (Karise et al., 2016; Kovach et al., 
2000; Mommaerts et al., 2011; Peng et al., 1992, case study). Nevertheless, 
there is room for improvement of the systems’ efficiency under adverse 
environmental conditions such as bad weather days (Espinosa et al., 2020; 
Karise et al., 2016). In addition, new products with suitable formulations need 
to be developed in order to improve the acquisition of the formulation by the 
vectors and provide alternatives for growers.
The bacteria discussed above have displayed the potential to perform 
as BCA. During the dispenser experiments, 11 out of 15 bumblebee workers 
(~72%) were significantly loaded with bacteria. Furthermore, after a first and 378 Entomovectoring: using pollinators to spread biocontrol agents

single flight, there was consistent transfer of the bacteria from the bumblebee 
to the flower.
This consistency was confirmed as 100% of the flowers sampled (i.e. at 
least 30–50% of the total number of flowers) were found to be loaded with 
bacteria and redistribution from flower to flower took place via the activity of 
the bumblebees.
To move one step closer to the commercialization of bacteria, their inhibitory 
activity in the field or in commercial greenhouses must also be determined. To 
assess whether bacteria can also effectively protect the strawberry plant on a 
commercial scale, more large-scale experiments need to be performed and the 
duration of the experiment should be increased.
Several other optimization possibilities should be considered. For example, 
the hygroscopic and clumpy texture of the bacterial formulation with Maizena 
should be addressed with a possible higher acquisition by Bombus terrestris
as a result.
It is also important to investigate the effect of the BCA bacteria on 
bumblebees, the environment, and humans. After all, the strawberry plant is a 
food crop and will therefore have to meet strict conditions. Hence, it is important 
that the BCA used does not exert any harmful effects on the strawberries, the 
consumer, or the vector.
More testing is required not only for new formulations but also for other 
bee species. In future studies, native species should be considered as well 
as their pollination efficiency might be higher due to closer co-evolutionary 
relationships with the native crops under protection or improved adaptation 
(Espinosa et al., 2020). The level of attraction between the bees and plants 
under protection should be investigated as well (Espinosa et al., 2020).
Another important factor that should be considered for further 
improvements to entomovectoring systems is the dispenser. By tracking and 
using the results that commercial growers obtain by making use of commercially 
available dispensers, interesting new information should surface for further 
improvement (Maccagnani et al., 2020). By investigating the separated traits 
of the dispenser as was done by Mommaerts et al. (2010) for their developed 
dispenser, optimization of the dispenser could be achieved (Maccagnani et al., 
2020). To ease further testing, standard protocols should be developed.
A final important aspect is the evaluation of socioeconomic factors. After 
all, producers often display resistance to change during commercialization 
(Espinosa et al., 2020). In some cases, the traditional agricultural methods 
limit the implementation of alternate technologies such as entomovectoring 
technology, for example, the use of products that are harmful to bees (Espinosa 
et al., 2020). In this regard, work has to be done to make producers see the 
entomovectoring technology as part of a strategy with a more sustainable and 
integrated management approach to protect crops against damage by pests © Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing Limited, 2023. All rights reserved.

and diseases. It may be possible to integrate entomovectoring into a larger 
crop protection system in which chemical fungicides are applied to plants 
before flowering and after harvest to reduce fungal loads and BCAs are applied 
during flowering to reduce exposure to fungicide residues for bees and reduce 
fungicide residues on fruit consumed by humans. This option may offer the 
best of both worlds.
6 Where to look for further information
Smagghe et  al. (2020) describes research and development of 
entomovectoring for use both in pollination and in the delivery of biocontrol 
agents against crop and pollinator diseases, pests, and parasites. The 
book describes studies on use of entomovectoring in both open fields and 
greenhouse settings. Mommaerts and Smagghe (2011) provides a nice 
overview of the different components of the entomovectoring system and 
how it works. Temmermans and Smagghe (2022) shares a critical view on 
the (dis)advantages of entomovectoring and on transport of pollinators for 
the purpose of entomovector systems. Professional organizations already 
commercializing the entomovectoring system are Biobest (https://www
.biobestgroup.com/) and Bee Vectoring Technology (https://www.beevt
