Preface
Water forms the greenest solvent available for chemical reactions in response to
nature’s plea for safer chemistry. Solvents comprise a large portion of the overall
mass handled in a chemical reaction, thus selecting the right one is crucial. In addi￾tion to being inexpensive and benign for the environment, using water as a solvent
also produces entirely new reactivity. Water is now employed as an imperative sol￾vent in a wide range of reactions, including oxidation–reduction processes, C–H
activations, radical reactions, pericyclic reactions, transition-metal catalysis, and so
forth. The switch from conventional organic solvents to green solvents is long over￾due. The prime goal of this book is to draw more attention to green organic syn￾thesis among researchers. The chapters are designed to explicate the importance
and potency of “nature’s reaction solvent” in organic synthesis. This book addresses
many aspects of organic synthesis in water, and the 17 chapters demonstrate the
complexity and the rapid progress of many areas in this field.
The first chapter comprises a general introduction to organic transformations in
water, discussing its historical developments and contributions to green chemistry.
The next chapter discusses “on-waterreactions” focusing on the mechanistic aspects
as well as on a range of reaction types. The third chapter deals with micellar and
phase-transfer catalysis that enables the desired transformations to occur in mild
aqueous conditions without the need for hazardous organic solvents. In the next
chapter, physicochemical aspects and the complex phase behaviors and mechanisms
of “on-water” and “in-water” reactions are explained. The fifth chapter focuses on
the direct functionalization of inert C—H bonds, in aqueous environments, offering
significant advantages in terms of sustainability, safety, and biocompatibility. Per￾forming multicomponent reactions (MCRs) in water offers a more sustainable and
environmentally friendly approach to the synthesis of bioactive heterocyclic com￾pounds, which is discussed in the next chapter. The seventh chapter describes the
influence of water on the reaction rates, regio- and stereochemical outcomes of peri￾cyclic reactions such as cycloaddition reactions, electrocyclic reactions, sigmatropic
rearrangements, and group transfer reactions. Recent progress in olefin metathesis
in water is portrayed in Chapter 8, with special reference to water-compatible
homogeneous and heterogeneous ruthenium metathesis catalyst systems. Chapter
9 addresses the advances over the past few years in oxidation and reduction reac￾tions using water as the reaction medium. Chapter 10 aims to summarize the recentxx Preface
advances in radical reactions in water, categorizing them according to different
catalytic modes. The next chapter primarily delves into synthetic transformations
involving carbene intermediates in water. Water as a suitable medium in several
nucleophilic additions and substitution reactions in water is showcased in Chapter
12. Chapter 13 exploresthe advancements and currentstate of asymmetric synthesis
in bulk water using advanced small molecular catalysts, including chiral metal
complexes and organocatalysts. The next chapter surveys the recent literature on
the synthesis of structurally diverse organic scaffolds utilizing various metal-free
organic substances in the aqueous medium. Establishing electroorganic procedures
that can be performed in an aqueous solution is the main focus of Chapter 15.
Chapter 16 gives an overview of photocatalytic synthetic methods by using water as a
reaction medium, by merging the innate green properties of water with the exploita￾tion of a renewable energy source, such as light. Finally, the last chapter illustrates
the industrially important organic reactions carried out in the aqueous medium.
Although aqueous organic chemistry has extensive applications and a bright
future, this subject is unfocused in current organic textbooks. Leading researchers
in the field of organic synthesis from academics across the globe have contributed
to this book. This book will be a very valuable reference source for students, post￾graduates, research scholars, professors, industrialists, and scientists. We hope our
vision to clutch the attention of researchers more toward green organic synthesis
will be successful through this book.

1.1 The Emergence of Water as a Solvent in Organic
Chemistry
A world without the plethora of goods produced by industrial organic synthesis
is inconceivable in terms of societal welfare. Environmental concerns have been
raising their head since the 1940s, coinciding with the expansion of industrial
activity [1]. Merely a tiny percentage of the earth’s resources are transformed into
the intended goods by chemical processes, producing copious amounts of toxic
elements and pollutants.
Solvents comprise a significant portion of the total mass needed in a chemical
process; therefore, selecting the right one is crucial. Water is the greenest solvent
readily accessible and has the least negative environmental effects. The reaction
solvent utilized by nature is water. It is an inexhaustible naturally occurring, non￾flammable, and abundantsolvent. Otherintriguing properties of water are the exten￾sive hydrogen bonding, the pH of water can be changed, salts or surfactants can be
added to provide salting-in or salting-out effects, and co-solvent or biphasic reaction
systems can be used [2].
In 1828, Wohler’s urea synthesis was the first organic reaction to employ water as
a solvent [3]. The synthesis of indigo by Baeyer and Drewsen in 1882 may be the
first instance of real organic synthesis. A sodium hydroxide solution was added to a
suspension of o-nitrobenzaldehyde in aqueous acetone during their synthesis. The
distinctive blue color of indigo appeared instantly, and the product eventually pre￾cipitated. But later on, water was practically eliminated from reactions as a result of
the development of organometallic chemistry. The availability of conventional sol￾vents for several processes has improved due to advancements in the petrochemical
industry. Also, there was a fallacy, “Corpora non agunt nisi fluida (or liquida) seu

soluta” (“The substances do not react unless fluid or if dissolved”) [4]. This state
of concern persisted until Breslow’s groundbreaking study in 1980 demonstrated
how adding water could accelerate the Diels–Alder process (Scheme 1.1) [5]. Here,
water continued to be the most effective medium. Furthermore, even faster rates
were produced by the salting-out effect of LiCl, which further reduced the solubil￾ity of organic partners in water. In addition, the presence of guanidinium chloride
acted to decrease hydrophobic interactions, which resulted in slower reactions. This
eliminated the possibility that the dissolution of organic reactants was necessary.

With the release of some masterworks by the Sharpless (Scheme 1.2) and Breslow
groups, water has gained popularity as a reaction medium [6, 7]. Sharpless called
these water-enhanced reactions between water-insoluble reactants “on-water
reactions.”
Butler, Coyne, and Fokin defined water-based reactions [8]. If the transition state
occurs in bulk water and the substrate solubility is more than 0.01 mol l
−1, the
reaction is said to occur “in water”. Substrates that have a solubility of less than
10−5 mol l
−1 in water and a transition state that takes place on the organic side of
the interface are considered to be “on-water” conditions. Lastly, both reaction types
are likely to happen simultaneously for reactants with intermediate solubilities
[9]. In a most recent review, Kitanosono and Kobayashi suggested classifying all1.2 Green Chemistry and Water 3

reactions that employ water as the reaction media as “in water,” regardless of
the usage of catalysts [10]. Recently, several reports, reviews, and chapters were
published showing the importance of water as a green organic solvent [11, 12].
However, the water as a reaction medium islessfocused on books[13]. Wateris now
exclusively employed as a green solvent in several organic transformations, such as
cross-coupling reactions, C–H activations, multicomponent reactions [14–16].
1.2 Green Chemistry and Water
Green chemistry, established about two decades ago, has drawn much attention [17].
The design of chemical processes and productsto minimize or eliminate the usage or
production of hazardous compounds is referred to as “green chemistry,” or sustain￾able chemistry [18]. The choice of green solventsto reduce toxicity and pollution is a
significant step toward implementing the twelve principles of green chemistry. Sol￾vents make up between 50% and 80% of the mass in a chemical process. Solvents are
an important factorthatsignificantly influence the total toxicity profile of a chemical
process.
They typically raise the most concerns regarding process safety issues because
of their volatility, flammability, and potential for explosion under specific circum￾stances [19]. Green alternatives include solventless systems, supercritical fluids
(SCF), green solvents like water, and, more recently, ionic liquids.
Among the 12 principles of green chemistry, the use of water as a solvent
always increases the greenness and sometimes the efficiency of the reaction
(Figure 1.1) [20].
Prevention of waste in a reaction is crucial forsustainable development. According
to estimates, solvents make up over 60% of the mass of chemicals in the pharmaceu￾tical and chemical sectors. Reuse of solvents is still rare, and the majority of these
solvents are incinerated after use to recover energy, which has a significant neg￾ative influence on the environment and waste output [21]. Furthermore, burning4 1 An Introduction to Organic Transformations in Water

organic solvents produces CO2, which is largely attributed to the waste output and,
to a lesser extent, to climate change. The E factor, positive material identification
(PMI), and other typical green chemistry metrics used in reactions conducted in
organic solvents are frequently taken into consideration in quantitative studies of
waste quantity production [22].
Synthetic methods should be designed in such a way that all reactants that par￾ticipate in the reaction are included in the final product. Hot-water-promoted, atom
economic 1,3-rearrangements of cyclic allylic alcohols were reported (Scheme 1.3)
[23]. Upon raising the temperature, the pKw of water increases, indicating a greater
abundance of the strong base OH− and strong acid H3O+ compared to 25 ∘C. Raising
the temperature also lowers the dielectric constant of water, improving its suitabil￾ity as a solvent for organic molecules. In contrast to high-temperature water under
pressure, hot water(between 60 and 100 ∘C) is more readily available in both natural
and laboratory settings.1.2 Green Chemistry and Water 5

The effective use of water as a solvent paves the way toward less hazardous chem￾ical synthesis. The development of tandem and cascade reaction techniques, which
combine as many reactions as feasible to yield the end product in a single operation,
is crucial to the creation of greener synthetics. Jamison and coworker synthesized
the essential component of the “ladder” polyether marine natural product through
a biomimetic cascade cyclization in neutral water (Scheme 1.4) [24].

Along with the advent of green chemistry concepts, the phrase “green solvent”
was also created and several studies on the use of safer solvents and auxiliaries arose.
To identify green solvents at an early stage, Capello et al. employed the EHS (E: Envi￾ronment, H: Health, and S: Safety) assessment approach to rate standard organic and
novel solvents (Table 1.1). The approach ranks solvents according to an EHS value
between zero and nine using nine effect categories for a solvent, including flamma￾bility, risk of explosion, decomposition, and toxicity. An elevated EHS value denotes
an elevated danger linked to the solvent. The EHS values of a few chosen solvents

used in chemical synthesis are displayed in (Table 1.1) [25]. Water has an EHS value
of 0 and is the safest solvent.
Anilkumar and coworkersreported the first iron-catalyzed coupling of aryl iodides
with phenols in water as a solvent [26]. Diaryl ethers are produced in good-to￾exceptional yields using a 1,2-dimethylethylenediamine (DMEDA) catalytic system
and inexpensive and easily accessible FeCl3⋅6H2O in this synthesis (Scheme 1.5).
Compatibility of this reaction with a broad variety of functional groups further
demonstrated its efficiency. Furthermore, the process is made easier because this
conversion is done in the presence of air. Therefore, the process offers a simple,
affordable, and environmentally responsible method of obtaining diaryl ethers.

Reducing derivatives is a key step to achieving green chemistry goals. The total
synthesis efficiency isincreased by the removal of laborious protection-deprotection
procedures for specific acidic-hydrogen-containing functional groups when water is
used as a solvent. The ability to use water-soluble hydroxyl groups directly without
protection or deprotection is a significant benefit of reactions in water. This charac￾teristic is helpful in the chemistry of carbohydrates, where protection and depro￾tection are frequently used [27]. For example, C-glycosides are potential enzyme
inhibitors commonly used in total synthesis. The traditional protocols involve the
addition of nucleophilesto a protected sugar while it is anhydrous. Wateris now used
as a solvent in an effective protocol that eliminates the need for laborious protection
and deprotection processes (Scheme 1.6). Using commercially available D-glucose
and pentane-2,4-dione asstarting materials, a one-step synthesis of 38 β-C glycosidic
ketone from an aqueous NaHCO3 solution in nearly quantifiable quantities was
achieved [28].

Catalysis via “in water” and “on-water” processes are known approaches [29].
Surfactants and the spontaneous development of micellar aqueous media, however,
offer a more widely applicable and practical way to deal with the limited solubility of
organic reagents and metal catalysts in water [30]. The hydrophobic effect in water
forms aggregates that function as nanoreactors [31]. Higher local concentrations1.2 Green Chemistry and Water 7
with rate enhancement and particularsolvation effectsresult from this, which favor￾ably influences the chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selectivity of the final product [32].
Amphiphilic surfactant Brij S-100 was employed for oxidative hydroxylation of
aromatic boronic acids to phenols using CuCl2 as a catalyst in water without the
need for bases or ligands (Scheme 1.7) [33]. The reaction proceeded smoothly with
several electron-withdrawing and electron-donating boronic acids to afford the cor￾responding phenols in moderate-to-excellent yields.

The use of renewable feedstock like bio-based compounds over fossil-based chem￾icals marks another step toward green chemistry. Research teams have just lately
begun to look into the use of biosurfactants in traditional micellar catalysis reac￾tions, such as Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings. High biodegradability and biological
synthesis from renewable feedstocks are the two greatest advantages of biosurfac￾tants; these two key benefits will further encourage the use of biosurfactants in
micellar catalysis [34].
Design for energy efficiency is a significant step toward green chemistry [35]. The
synthesis of 2-substituted 2,3-dihydro-1H-perimidines on water using a unique,
environmentally friendly, and energy-efficient protocol was reported by Anilkumar
and coworkers [36]. Using a catalyst-free on-water technique at room temperature,
1,8-diaminonaphthalene is reacted with various aldehydes to produce the 2,3-
dihydro-1H-perimidine product in 30 minutes with moderate-to-good yields
(Scheme 1.8). A multigram scale reaction is also carried out to guarantee the
reaction’s scalability.

Designing for degradation and designing safer chemicals that are biodegradable or
less harmful to the environment is of utmost importance [37, 38]. Petrochemical
compounds are the primary source of surfactants used by the chemical industry. As
a result, traditional neutral or anionic surfactants do not meet these criteria. In this8 1 An Introduction to Organic Transformations in Water
sense, emerging designer surfactants mark a significant shift since all newly sug￾gested amphiphilic molecules consist of bio-based units, at least in the hydrophobic
portion. For use in the Ullmann type C–S coupling reaction in water mediated by
copper salt, an intriguing new surfactant bearing a sugar unit for metal catalysis
in water was described (Scheme 1.9). It connects a lactose hydrophilic unit to an
aliphatic alkyl chain forming the alkyl lactosamine ALA-14, which is readily syn￾thesized and naturally degradable [39].

Reactions in water thus naturally contribute to inherently safer chemistry for
accident prevention regarding common dangers, such as fires, explosions, or toxicity
on release, in contrast to extensively used catalytic processes in organic solvent
systems [40].
Real-time analysis for pollution prevention, in-process monitoring and control
before the creation of hazardous chemicals, and analytical methods must be further
developed [41]. For reactions carried out in water,such analysis can identify catalyst
poisoning, changes in process pH or temperature before a reaction spirals out of
control, and other harmful events before a significant catastrophe happens.
1.3 Conclusion
The development of organic reactions in water has received tremendous attention
from chemists over the past two decades, and this topic is seeing a significant
expansion in study. Lipophilic substrates react in hydrophobic pockets that are
generated in water. These pocketsserve asreaction vesselsthat mimic the chemistry
found in nature and give us a clear path forward for further research in this field.
Employing surfactants in micellar conditions – in which the micelle functions as
a nano-reactor is another simplest way to do catalysis in water. The use of water
as a solvent for organic transformations has the potential to significantly advance
the fields of chemistry, the chemical industry, and environmental preservation.
Putting its regulation into action is one of its biggest obstacles. It takes a lot of
work to properly screen reaction conditions to facilitate the reactions in water. InReferences 9
the approaching decades, water as a solvent will remain intriguing and beneficial
as there will be a lot more reports released in this area. A greater emphasis on
large-scale application should be placed on research. More lenient legislation,
faster technology transfers between academia and governments, and tax breaks for
businesses using such green standards in the workplace are all necessary to enable
the adoption of these technologies in the business sector.

Chemistry of “On-Water” Reactions

2.1 Introduction
The use of water as a solvent in organic synthesis can be traced back to Wöhler’ssyn￾thesis of urea from silver cyanate with ammonium chloride. Thisis considered one of
the foundation reactions in organic synthesis. However, over the next 150 years, the
use of water in organic synthesis became less common due to solubility and incom￾patibility issues with many of the reactions developed. The focus of this chapter is
to examine the use of water as a solvent, specifically in what are termed on-water
reactions [1]. On-water reactions have been extensively reviewed, and the aim of
this chapter is to give an overview of key developments in this area [2–7]. Reactions
which have been classed as in-water or using micellar catalysis will be discussed for
comparison purposes with on-water reactions; however, these will not be the focus
of this chapter [8].
In 1980, Breslow and Rideout reported a kinetic study exploring the Diels–Alder
[4+2] cycloaddition reaction of cyclopentadiene and methyl vinyl ketone using water
as a solvent [9]. It was observed that the reaction of cyclopentadiene and methyl
vinyl ketone as dienophile using was 740 times faster in comparison with that of the
organic solvent, isooctane (Scheme 2.1). This was an unexpected result both due to
the magnitude of the rate acceleration and that cyclopentadiene is sparingly soluble
in water.
Upon changing the dienophile to acrylonitrile, an increase in rate of just over 30
times was measured in comparison with isooctane. These results were surprising
for several reasons. First, cycloaddition reactions are generally thought to be “sol￾vent insensitive” with little change in the rate ofreaction with a change in the solvent
polarity. Second, a highly insoluble diene such as cyclopentadiene underwent a reac￾tion using water as a solvent, and with methyl vinyl ketone asthe dienophile, a large
rate acceleration was observed. However, upon changing the dienophile to acryloni￾trile, the rate increase was not as pronounced.
Breslow and Maitra followed up this kinetic study with a synthetic study by
exploring the reactions of cyclopentadiene and a range of dienophiles using water

as a solvent (Scheme 2.2) [10]. The reaction of cyclopentadiene and methyl vinyl
ketone using water as a solvent produced two products, an endo and an exo isomer
(ratio 21.4 : 1). It was observed that the endo selectivity of these reactions increased
using methyl vinyl ketone as a dienophile, whereas upon changing the dienophile
to methyl acrylate, this was not as pronounced (ratio 9.3 : 1). When the reactions
were carried out using ethanol as a solvent, an increase in endo:exo selectivity was
observed; however, this was not to the same extent as that of water as a solvent.
Breslow proposed that the rate increase and the increase in endo selectivity using
water as a solvent with methyl vinyl ketone were due to the hydrophobic effect.
The hydrophobic effect can be explained as in the highly polar environment of the
water solvent the hydrophobic organic substrates aggregate together increasing the2.1 Introduction 13
rate of the reaction. This is however an oversimplification and does not consider
the differences in rate observed for methyl vinyl ketone in comparison with acry￾lonitrile. Subsequent computational studies by Jorgensen and coworkers suggest
a more complex mechanistic picture with influences from both the hydropho￾bic effect as well as a significant contribution from hydrogen bonding effects
[11, 12].
In 2005, Sharpless and coworkers reported the 2σ +2σ +2π reaction of quadri￾cyclane with dimethyl azodicarboxylate (DMAD) using water as a solvent
(Scheme 2.3) [1]. When this reaction was carried out using isooctane as the solvent,

it took >12 hours to complete. Changing to the more polar solvent, methanol, this
took 18 hours to go to completion. Surprisingly, when the reaction was carried out
using water as a solvent, the reaction was complete within 10 minutes, a significant
increase in the rate of reaction. Upon addition of the reactants, it was observed
that the highly colored DMAD floated on the water surface, and as the reaction
proceeded, this disappeared, leading to the formation of the colorless product.
Sharpless classified these as on-water reactions, as the reactants were seen to float
on the water surface. Several other reaction types were also reported by Sharpless
and co-workers, including the Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction and the epoxide
ring opening reaction (Scheme 2.1), both of which were also found to be accelerated
using water as a solvent. In all three cases reported, the concentration of the reac￾tants was >3 M, which defied the conventional thinking that reactants needed to be
fully soluble in the solvent for the reaction to progress. While these reactions show
significant rate acceleration, in subsequent studies by other research groups using
on-water reactions, the large rate accelerations observed by Sharpless are not always
as pronounced or do not occur. This presents one of the major challenges as to how
to classify a reaction as either in-water or on-water.
2.1.1 Classification of In-Water and On-Water Reactions
There have been a number of attempts to classify reactions as to whether they are
on-water or in-water, and this remains one of the challenges in distinguishing these
modes of reaction. Butler and Coyne examined the synthetic and kinetic studies of
the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of the phthalazinium-2-dicyanomethanide
1,3-dipole with a range of dipolarophiles using water as a solvent [13, 14]. The
1,3-dipole was found to be highly insoluble in water; however, the reactions pro￾ceeded as normal using water as a solvent, where the products either crashed out of
solution and could be filtered off or floated as an oil on the surface of the water layer.
Using the computationally measured solubilities of the reactants, they proposed
a general transition from an in-water to an on-water mechanism-dependent upon
the solubilities. This approach presents some challenges where the calculated
solubilities may not be a true representation of the experimental solubilities.
However, as there are a limited number of experimental solubility measurements,
the computationally calculated solubilities can be used as a guide to classify these
reactions.
Kitanosono and Kobayashi reported a study where they classified reactions
depending on their component’s interactions with water [15]. These could
be divided into three different types: Type I, Type II, and Type III. These types can
be further divided into sub-groups. While this allows the classification of reactions
into several different reaction types, it presents a challenge to truly understand
what is happening on the molecular level using water as a solvent. Reactions, for
example, with two components, could be seen as perhaps more straightforward to
classify in comparison with a reaction, for example, a Suzuki coupling reaction with
up to five or more components. This presents the challenge of classifying reactions
as on-water or in-water reactions. Perhaps each reaction needs to be judged on a2.1 Introduction 15
case-by-case basis considering all the components present rather than on a broader
classification of reaction type.
2.1.2 Mechanistic Aspects
One of the major challenges with on-water reactions has been to explain how these
reactions occur and, why in some cases, large rate accelerations are observed, this is
still not well understood. While there have been a significant number of reactions
classified as on-water, the large rate accelerations observed in the initial reports
by Sharpless and coworkers are not always observed. Jung and Marcus were one
of the first to examine the reactions reported by Sharpless and coworkers using
computational methods and proposed that the critical aspect of these lies at the
water-oil interface, where OHfree groups from the water protrude into the oil phase
and act in a catalytic manner [16]. However, understanding the rate acceleration of
on-water reactions may lie in the unique chemistry between water and reactants
that occurs at an oil droplet-water phase boundary, and while computational
approaches can propose mechanisms for these, experimentally, these are highly
challenging to study [17].
Beattie, McErlean, and Phippen examined the Diels–Alder 4+2 cycloaddition of
cyclopentadiene and dimethyl fumarate using water as a solvent [18]. The reactants,
both of which are not highly soluble in water, were found to undergo an on-water
reaction where the product was isolated in a yield of 75%. However, the stirring
rate of the reaction was shown to be crucial to ensure that the reaction went via an
on-water reaction mechanism. When the reaction was carried out using a four-stage
piston homogenizer, it was observed that the rate increased significantly, suggest￾ing that the droplet size has a significant influence on the rate. Interestingly, a H/D
effect was observed where the yield on-D2O was 56% different to that of the on-water
reaction at 75%.
Kitanosono and Kobayashi proposed a new water model, where three layers of
water, with different orientations, can be found at the interface [15]. This model
considers catalysts, whether located in the aqueous or lipophilic phases. The first
layer, where water molecules orient protons toward the hydrophobic phase (defined
as the inner Helmholtz layer), is surrounded by a second layer (defined as the outer
Helmholtz layer), and then followed by the bulk layer. The partial polarization
of water at the interface would help with the formation of weak interactions
with highly oriented transition states. However, as with the previous models,
experimental evidence is further needed to explore this (Scheme 2.4).
2.1.3 Influence of Stirring Rate
Organic reactions are generally stirred to ensure the dissolution of the reactants
in the solvent; however, little consideration is given to the stirring rate. In the
initial reports of the on-water reactions by Sharpless and coworkers, the reaction
of quadricyclane and DMAD was vigorously stirred on-water, which enabled the
reaction to be carried out in minutes. Ensuring the reaction is vigorously stirred is
a recurring theme in many reports where on-water reaction conditions have been16 2 Chemistry of “On-Water” Reactions

with p-chlorobenzylidineacetone. When the reaction was carried out at ambi￾ent temperature (20 ∘C) <1% yield of the products was observed after 48 hours.
When the reaction temperature was increased to 75 ∘C, the products (a mixture
of diastereoisomers 6.2 : 1) were observed to have an 86% yield. Interestingly,
this reaction only occurred upon liquefaction of the p-chlorobenzylidine acetone
dipolarophile with vigorous stirring (Scheme 2.5) [19, 20]. A similar outcome was

observed with the reaction of phthalaziuium-2-dicyanomethanide with dipheny￾lacetylene, where the reaction occurred on-water with vigorous stirring above the
melting point of the dipolarophile in a yield of 71%. In both cases, liquefaction of the
dipolarophile was needed for the reaction to proceed. When the dipolarophile was
changed to para-substituted N-phenyl maleimides, it was observed that the yellow
suspension at the start of the reaction was replaced with a white suspension of the
product at the reaction end. This reaction was carried out at 20 ∘C with vigorous
stirring; however, in this instance, no liquefaction of the dipolarophile was needed
for the reaction to complete.
Kobayashi and coworkers examined the asymmetric aldol-catalyzed Lewis
acid-surfactant (LASC) reaction using water as a solvent [21]. This surfactant
catalyst has a long chain anionic surfactant that has a metal cation, and these can
form colloidal dispersions of organic molecules in water. When the reaction of
benzaldehyde and a silyl enolvinyl ether using 10 mol% of the catalyst (Sc(DS)3)
was examined, this led to the formation of a monolayer of the surfactants with
the organic molecules encapsulated in them. Upon examination of this reaction
at varying stirring rates (0–1400 rpm), a significant difference in the rate of the
reaction was observed. With vigorous stirring, the reaction was complete in four
hours; however, when the reaction was stopped after four hours with no stirring,
the reaction was significantly slower. The higher the stirring rate, the smaller the
colloidal dispersions in the aqueous phase, with an increased rate in the reaction
comparable to that of the on-water mechanism.
Li and coworkers examined the reaction of indoles with 1,4-benzoquinone in a
range of different solvents (Scheme 2.6) [22]. The reaction carried out over 10 hours
in organic solvents gave at best a 38% conversion (EtOH). When the solvent was
changed to water, it was found that the reactants formed an aqueous suspension
that needed to be stirred vigorously, and the product was observed to have an 82%
conversion after 10 hours.

A interesting reaction was reported by Capriati and coworkers, who showed that
the nucleophilic addition of organolithium reagents to imines could be carried out
on-water (Scheme 2.7) [23]. The reaction of aldimine with n-BuLi was used as a
model reaction, where this was examined using water as a solvent and a variation of
the order of addition was also assessed. When the reaction was carried out under vig￾orous stirring which generated an emulsion, the n-BuLi was added to the aldimine,
and the yield of the reaction was observed to be 96%. However, changing the stirring18 2 Chemistry of “On-Water” Reactions

speed to a lower speed under the same reaction conditions gave a yield of 66%.
Changing the reaction solvent to D2O, a drop in yield to 57% was observed. When
the reaction was carried out using methanol as a solvent, this generated a product
with a 15% yield. Capriati and coworkers proposed that the significant D/H isotopic
effect observed on changing from H2O to D2O suggested that the on-water catalysis
arises from the proton transfer across the water–organic interface. However, more
in-depth mechanistic studies are needed to further understand these observations.
The change in the stirring rate of a reaction, while not a factor that is generally
considered for organic reactions, could have major implications for reactions,
which occur on-water. The formation of organic microdroplets in the aqueous envi￾ronment could provide the mechanism by which these reactions can offer favorable
results over conventional organic solvents. The surface area and the nature of the
water−organic interface in these heterogeneous processes are of importance to
explaining the observed reactivity changes, and further work to understand this is
crucial to the understanding of the mechanism of on-water reactions.
2.1.4 On-Droplet Effects
The understanding of the nature of the surface area and that of the water–organic
interface in these heterogeneous processes is challenging. Several groups have
explored the use of the microdroplet methodologies to try and understand this.
This methodology have been used in a wide range of applications in chemistry and
biology, and the applicability of this to on-water reactions has been highlighted
[24]. The surface area of an on-water reaction can be maximized by agitation (see
Section 2.1.3); however, this can also be achieved by using microdroplets. When the
microdroplets are coupled with mass spectroscopy detection, it offers a powerful
platform to study these reactions.
Fokin and Eremin examined the on-water chemoselective reaction switch in the
synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles from organic azides and bromoethene￾sulfonyl fluoride (BrESF) [25]. The reaction was examined in water microdroplets2.1 Introduction 19

at the intersection area between two nebulizer plumes in the electrospray ioniza￾tion chamber (Scheme 2.8). The reaction was initially examined using four differ￾ent solvents: acetonitrile, toluene, DCM, and DMF, with varying amounts of water
droplets generated by a second nebulizer. When mixture of the benzyl azide and the
BrESF in a ratio of 1 : 2 in these four solvents was sprayed into the MS instrument,
no signal was observed for the product. However, when water was introduced at a
flow rate of 5 μl/min−1 by the formation of the product was observed by the accu￾rate mass and isotopic distribution of the product. The initial cycloaddition prod￾uct was not observed, instead this undergoes rapid elimination-aromatization. The
rate of the reaction in microdroplets is significantly higher than in solution and
favors an alternate reaction pathway compared to conventional synthesis in a reac￾tion flask. The nature of the water surface and developed H-bonding network are
critical forthisreaction, and interestingly, when the reaction was carried out on-D2O
droplets, this reaction exhibits a negative solvent isotope effect as great as 8.8.
Zare and coworkers examined the “on-droplet” chemistry of the reaction of
quadricyclane and DMAD, which was one of the original reactions reported by
Sharpless and coworkers, identifying the on-water reaction [26]. When the reaction
was examined in aqueous microdroplets (c. 5 μm), the reaction was accelerated by
a factor of 102 greater than that of the on-water reaction reported by Sharpless and
coworkers. Under these reaction conditions, it was observed that DMAD reacts with
itself to form hydrazine carboxylates, which were detected using mass spectroscopy.
Zare and coworkers have suggested that the “on-droplet” chemistry is like that of
on-water chemistry.
The use of microdroplet methodologies coupled to mass spectroscopy is an active
area, and research groups such as those of Richard Zare and Graham Cooks have
developed organic reactions that seem to challenge the reactivity that is observed
in bulk reactions [27, 28]. The application of this methodology to on-water reac￾tions could offer a method of studying the water–organic interface, which to date
has proved challenging using conventional analytical techniques.20 2 Chemistry of “On-Water” Reactions
2.2 Broadening the Scope of On-Water Reactions
There are a significant number of reviews, which have discussed the scope of
on-water reactions, and the emergence of new areas of research has enabled the
on-water concept to expand its applicability. This section highlights several areas
where the on-water methodology is giving important insights. However, given the
large number of reports in the literature using on-water, this is not a comprehensive
discussion of these research areas, and reference should be made to the already
published reviews in this area.
2.2.1 Light-Mediated Reactions
Radical reactions are synthetically useful reactions in organic synthesis; however,
there has been little exploration of using water as a solvent for these reactions [29].
With the emergence of photoredox catalysis in organic synthesis, this has become
a highly active area of research [30]. However, there are only a number of reports
of on-water reactions using light-mediated conditions. König and coworkers exam￾ined a photochemical reaction at the oil-water interface, where they examined as
a model the reaction of indole and isoquinoline-1-carbonitrile, under 365 nm light
irradiation at 25 ∘C (Scheme 2.9) [31]. Using water as a reaction solvent, the NH
arylation product was obtained in 92% yield. After exploring a range of solvents, it
was observed that water gave the best yields for the reaction. When the solvent was
changed to methanol, the yield was reduced to 15%, and even with a 1 : 1 mixture
of water: methanol, a yield of only 20% was observed. A wide range of substrates
were examined, including applying this methodology as a key step for the synthesis
of known drug molecules, and in almost all cases, the yields were good to excellent.

on-water methodology.2.2 Broadening the Scope of On-Water Reactions 21
When the indole and isoquinoline-1-carbonitrile, which are both solids, were com￾bined in the presence of water, yellow oil droplets were observed. Melting point
measurements indicated that stoichiometric amounts of these compounds form an
eutectic mixture melting atroom temperature. Upon melting, the hydrophobic effect
of water forces the two reactants to form an electron-donor acceptor (EDA) complex
on the water surface, where this forms H-bonds with water, upon irradiation with
light at 365 nm thisleadsto the formation of a radical ion pair, which ultimately leads
to the product. A range of substitutions and heterocyclic rings allow this methodol￾ogy to be applied to a diverse range of different heterocyclic scaffolds.
2.2.2 Electrochemical Reactions
Electrochemical reactions have experienced a surge in interest in the last decade,
with the research group of Phil Baran leading the re-emergence of this methodology
[32]. Electrochemical organic synthesis using water has been shown to be an ideal
solvent for these reactions [33].
Compton and coworkers examined the electrochemical reaction of water immis￾cible liquid aliphatic acids leading to decarboxylation to afford a hydrocarbon. This
can be achieved using an emulsion formed by sonication, so that the organic phase
constantly extracts the products [34]. Power ultrasound was used to emulsify hex￾anoic acid in an aqueous NaOH biphasic system, and afterthe passage of an electrical
charge, this led to the formation of n-decane (a Kolbe dimer).
Diniz and coworkers examined the metal-free Reformatsky reaction of ethyl
2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate and benzaldehyde [35]. These were electrolyzed in a
divided cell with a potential of −1.2V versus Ag/AgCl, and several types of carbon
cathodes and platinum anodes were used. The product of the reaction was obtained
in yields of up to 46% with varying amounts of side products. It was shown that a
three-phase system (aqueous, organic, and solid) was essential to optimizing the
yield of the coupling product and suppressing side reactions (Scheme 2.10a).
Tanaka and coworkers examined the electroorganic synthesis of an oil-in-water
nanoemulsion TEMPO-mediated electrooxidation of amphiphilic alcohols using
water (Scheme 2.10b) [36]. Electrooxidation of polyethylene glycol monomethyl
ethers gave the corresponding carboxylic acids in good yields. When water soluble
alcohols were used, this did not effectively give the corresponding carboxylic acids.
In cases of water insoluble alcohols, the electrooxidation did not proceed smoothly.
A plausible mechanism for the electrooxidation is that in aqueous solutions of the
alcohol, this would interact lipophilically with TEMPO and hydrophobically with
water to form a nanoemulsion. This would then disperse in water and bring the
TEMPO radical to the anode by diffusion. Electron transfer from the TEMPO radical
to the anode would occur in the nanoemulsion to afford the N-oxoammonium ion,
which would oxidize the surrounding alcohol. In the case of the water insoluble
alcohols, the TEMPO radical would be incorporated into the oil droplets (much
larger than the microemulsion) and be separated from the anode so that the
oxidation of the TEMPO did not occur readily.22 2 Chemistry of “On-Water” Reactions

Electrochemical organic synthesis, both in-water and on-water, is still in the early
stages of exploration in comparison with those in organic solvents; however, there
is scope to improve this methodology to include aqueous environments.
2.2.3 Flow Chemistry
Flow chemistry has emerged as a method to synthesize molecules in a continuous
fashion in comparison with the more traditional methods employed with batch
chemistry in a round-bottomed flask. This methodology has been adapted by a
wide range of applications, from the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients
(API’s) to the synthesis of complex natural products [37, 38]. Using the on-water
methodology in flow chemistry presents challenges, especially where reactants and
products are suspensions in the aqueous phase, which can prove problematic for
flow reactors.
Raston and coworkers developed vortex fluidic devices(VFD), which enhance the
on-water effects and catalysis using in-flow [39]. In this reactor, reagents are added
to a rapidly spinning tube and react in a thin film. In the confined mode, the mix￾ture remainsin the tube; however, this can be converted to a continuous mode where2.2 Broadening the Scope of On-Water Reactions 23
products exit the top. It is hypothesized that the thin film processing could poten￾tially enhance the on-water effect. As a proof of concept, an azide–alkyne cycload￾dition reaction was explored. The uncatalyzed reaction (copper-free) was examined
between benzyl azide and the disubstituted alkyne, where conversion to triazole was
higher than in MeCN or the neat reaction. This was also higher than the magnetic
stirring batch reaction. When moved to continuous mode, the conversion of the reac￾tions with a range ofsubstituted azides and terminal alkynes(copper catalyzed from
the reactor at a final concentration of 9 ppb) was up to 99%,showing the applicability
of this reaction methodology (Scheme 2.11).

Benaglia and coworkers reported the in continuo organolithium, in addition to
imines, where the reaction can be carried out in three minutes using an on-water
methodology [40]. This methodology builds upon the results reported by Capriati
and coworkers [23]. The on-water continuous-flow addition of organolithium
reagents to imines was studied in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with
very fast reaction times of 10–20 seconds, leading to a safer process in comparison24 2 Chemistry of “On-Water” Reactions
with the batch reaction. Using the setup as described in Scheme 2.11b for the
organolithium addition to imines, it was found that yields may be improved simply
by changing the flow rate of water and adjusting the amount of water. By using
a 2 : 1 imine/water flow rate ratio, amine and product were obtained in 93% and
80% isolated yields, respectively, by using about 6 mol/equiv water (Scheme 2.11b),
entries 1 and 3. In a single 2.5 ml CSTR, 5 g amine can be synthesized in only three
minutes, which is a very significant improvement on the batch-type process.
2.2.4 Prebiotic Chemistry
The origins of life on earth have been debated for some time, and yet there is no
universal agreement as to how this arose. However, what is agreed is that water was
essential for the appearance of key reactions in prebiotic chemistry, which led to
the formation of molecules that were essential for the emergence of life [41, 42].
The majority of on-water reactions reported are unlikely to be relevant for prebiotic
chemistry [43]. However, there are a number of reactions, which have been reported
using prebiotically plausible molecules that could have arisen in the emergence of
life on Earth.
Shapiro and Vigalok explored a Passerini multicomponent reaction, examining
both the on-water and in-water reactions by modulating the solubilities of the
reactants (Scheme 2.12a) [44]. The two reactants, aldehyde and isocyanide, were
added to the reaction mixture, and the aldehyde underwent in situ oxidation to

form an acid, which then underwent reaction in a Passerini reaction. The reaction
was explored with a range of aldehydes and water-insoluble isocyanides. In all
cases, the water-insoluble aldehydes gave the three-component Passerini product in
high yields, while partially soluble aldehydes gave a mixture of both products. An
interesting observation is that the reaction in-water was slower than the reaction
on-water.
Pirrung and Sarma examined the Passerini three-component reaction with three
different components, and when the reaction was carried out in dichloromethane,
a yield of 45% was obtained over 18 hours (Scheme 2.12b) [45]. When the solvent
was changed to water, the reaction was complete in 3.5 hours and became heteroge￾neous because the product is poorly soluble. The three components of the reaction
are also highly hydrophobic. The comparison of the rates of reaction shows that the
rate using water as a solvent was 18 timesfasterthan that of dichloromethane. When
the reaction temperature waslowered to 4 ∘C, the reaction went to completion in 94%
yield and with an even more significant increase in the rate of the reaction.
What is interesting with this reaction is that aldehydes and isocyanides are plausi￾ble prebiotic molecules, and the three-component reaction enables molecular com￾plexity to be built up quickly. Sutherland and coworkers examined a prebiotically
plausible Passerini multicomponentreaction of phosphates[46, 47]. However, under
the reaction conditions, excess aldehyde and isonitrile were required, and the trans￾fer of the phosphate to the newly formed hydroxyl group did not take place. However,
despite these limitations of the reaction, it is possible that biology evolved to use
these compounds to build up molecules of life.
2.3 Conclusions
The use of water as a solvent continues to be applied to a greater number of reac￾tion types. Interestingly, reactions such as those that use organolithium reagents
have been shown to be possible using water as a solvent, showing that conventional
thinking for these reactions do not need to be adhered to. While the broadening of
the reaction type has expanded, one major challenge that needs further exploration
is the mechanistic aspects. An understanding of these reactions could offer insight
as to how they occur and why, in some cases, large rate accelerations are observed.
The emergence of microdroplet platforms could offer a solution to studying these
reactions, but examining them at the molecular level will be key to understanding
them. The application of this methodology continues to be applied to a diverse array
ofreactions, and thisislikely to broaden even furtherinto areassuch as electrochem￾istry, flow chemistry, and prebiotic chemistry.

3.1 Introduction
Chemical synthesis has come a long way since Wohler’s groundbreaking urea
synthesis in 1828 [1, 2]. Since then, synthetic chemistry has become a very powerful
area for creating complex molecules with exceptional control over the regio- and
stereo-chemistry [2, 3]. This progress has been instrumental in improving the qual￾ity of life, such as by producing life-saving drugs, agricultural products to reduce
hunger, and components for electronic devices for entertainment and communi￾cations. However, these developments come with a cost, where “sustainability”
has been largely neglected, thereby increasing pollution and negatively impacting
health and safety. The over-reliance on non-sustainable petroleum-derived solvents
and the inefficiencies of synthetic practices led to poor atom- and step-economy
[4–7]. In pharmaceutical and chemical industries, producing one kilogram of
product typically generates an additional 5–100 times of chemical waste, high￾lighting the inefficiencies during chemical synthesis [8]. Therefore, it is critical
to address these challenges by preserving our finite resources with a focus on
minimizing waste generation. These initiatives are important to have a healthy
society.
With the broader meaning of sustainability, John Werner and Paul Anastas
established 12 principles of green chemistry, which served as a guiding plat￾form to reform synthetic practices toward sustainability [7, 9, 10]. By early 2000,
various green chemistry tools and metrics were developed to evaluate chemical
processes and identify improvement opportunities. These tools included E-factor
[11], atom-economy [12], process-mass intensity [13], i-GAL [14], and DOZNTM
[15]. Analysis using these tools revealed that organic solvents, while not directly
involved in chemical transformations, contribute significantly to waste generation
and greenhouse gas emissions [16, 17]. In active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)
synthesis, solvents can account for up to 88% of total waste [17]. Process chemists

can minimize the carbon footprint by selecting sustainable solvents, enhancing
sustainability, and improving process economics. A shift toward more sustainable
organic chemistry practices requires a fundamental change in selecting the proper
solvent in the correct quantity [16, 17].
To promote greener practices, chemists have explored alternative solvents [4]. To
reduce the carbon footprint associated with petroleum-derived solvents, researchers
focus on utilizing solvents derived from bio-renewable resources, such as cyrene
[18] and 2-methyl THF [19]. Additionally, the use of water as a reaction medium
is considered sustainable because it is safe, noncombustible, affordable, abundant,
and has a lower carbon footprint even after use [20–23]. However, despite initial
reports, the insolubility ofreactants and the sensitivity of catalysts and reagents have
impeded the widespread adoption of water as a solvent. To overcome these limita￾tions, introducing amphiphilic molecules as additives has emerged as a strategy to
enhance the solubility of organic reactantsin the aqueous phase, thereby facilitating
chemical reactions [20, 24, 25]. This innovation has revitalized the potential of
water as the bulk solvent for enabling organic synthesis. This approach substan￾tially differs from the traditional “on-water” approach as the operating principles
differ.
Thus, due to the utmost importance of micellar catalysis and phase-transfer catal￾ysis (PTC), we concisely highlight the fundamental principles governing micellar
and PTC without any duplication, as several reviews are available on this topic, as
mentioned in Section 3.3. In this chapter, we also highlight the industrial applica￾tions of these technologies in the context of the synthesis of APIs and agrochemical
products. This chapter offers valuable insights into the potential future directions of
these technologies and their associated challenges.
3.2 Understanding the Concept of Micellar Catalysis
Amphiphiles, also called surfactants, have balanced hydrophilic (water-attracting)
and hydrophobic (water-repelling) regions within their structure. The term “am￾phiphilic” comes from the Greek words “amphi,” meaning both, and “philos,”
meaning loving. These molecules play pivotal roles in diverse biological, chemical,
and physical processes, especially in forming supramolecular structures, such as
micelles, bilayers, and membranes. Amphiphiles typically consist of two distinct
parts: a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. The hydrophilic head contains
polar or charged groups that readily interact with water molecules, while the
hydrophobic tail is often composed of nonpolar hydrocarbon chains or other
water-insoluble groups. Surfactants are classified into four categories based on
the charge of the hydrophilic part: cationic, anionic, non-ionic, and zwitterionic.
The cationic surfactant has a positively charged hydrophilic head, whereas the
anionic surfactant possesses a negatively charged head (generally, carboxylate,
sulfonate, or sulfate). In the case of non-ionic surfactants, hydrophilic heads are not
electrically charged. The zwitterionic amphiphile has both positively and negatively
charged hydrophilic heads. In the context of micellar catalysis, we will be primarily
discussing the non-ionic surfactants (Scheme 3.1).3.3 Basic Principles of Phase-Transfer Catalysis 31

Scheme 3.1 Commonly used surfactants.
When surfactant molecules are introduced into a solution, they organize to mini￾mize their exposure to the surrounding solvent. For example, in a polarsolvent such
as water, surfactants will align their hydrophilic heads toward the water molecules
while their hydrophobic tails aggregate in the core region, away from water. This
arrangement results in the formation of micelles [20] and the phenomenon is called
micellization [26]. Several factors influence micellization, such as (i) surfactant
concentration [27], (ii) temperature [28], (iii) nature of the surfactant [29], and
pH of the solution [30]. There are various experimental techniques to understand
the micellization process, such as dynamic light scattering, which measures the
average size distribution of micelles [31], while cryogenic transmission electron
microscopy (cryo-TEM) provides information about the shape and morphology of
micelles through direct imaging [32].
These dynamic micellar structures facilitate and enhance chemical reactions
under aqueous conditions. The hydrophobic core of the dynamic micelles can serve
as a microchamber with distinctsolubility properties compared to the bulk solution.
This hydrophobic core allows the solubilization of non-polar molecules because of
the hydrophobic effect, a phenomenon that arises when nonpolar or hydrophobic
molecules clump together to minimize contact with water [24, 33]. The distinct
environment within the micelles has the potential to affect the reactivity and
selectivity of specific reactions.
3.3 Basic Principles of Phase-Transfer Catalysis
In certain chemical reactions, if one or more of the reactants are insoluble or poorly
soluble in the reaction medium, it can significantly affect the reaction outcome.
This can be attributed to the ineffective mass transfer, leading to a decreased rate
of effective collisions between the reactants. To address these concerns, biphasic
reactions can be employed, which involve two phases that are not miscible, typi￾cally a liquid–liquid system. This approach allows reactants with poor solubility in
a single solvent to be distributed between two phases, enhancing their contact and
improving the efficiency of the reaction [34–36]. Typically, one phase acts as the
reaction medium, while the other serves as a reservoir, supplying the insoluble reac￾tant. However, due to the immiscible nature of the biphasic solvents, the reactants32 3 Chemistry of “In-Water” Reactions: Spotlights on Micellar and Phase-Transfer Catalysis
cannot easily come into contact. In such instances, a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC) is
utilized. These catalystsfacilitate the transfer of one reactant to the otherimmiscible
solvent phase, thereby enabling the desired transformation to occur more effectively.
Technically, catalytic amounts of phase transfer agents promote the interphase trans￾fer of species/reagents, thus enabling reactions between reagents in two immiscible
phases. The phase transfer catalyst possesses both functionalsitesto become soluble
in both systems, enabling the transfer of chemicals from one non-miscible, hetero￾geneous system to another by a chemical process [37–41].
A simple example of PTC is the Williamson ether synthesis [42]. This reaction
involves the SN
2 attack of the alkoxide nucleophile on the alkyl halide electrophile.
Alkali metal alkoxides/hydroxides are common sources of alkoxide/hydroxide ions,
which have a high solubility in aqueoussolutions. Organic compounds,such as alkyl
halides, are typically insoluble or partially soluble in water. A PTC, such as a quater￾nary ammonium salt, is usually employed to overcome thissolubility issue because it
helpstransfer alkoxide/hydroxide ionsfrom the aqueous phase to the organic phase,
thereby facilitating their reaction with the alkyl halide to form the desired ether.
PTCs are usually organic compounds with hydrophobic (nonpolar alkyl chain)
and hydrophilic (polar quaternary ammonium or phosphonium cation) moieties
[38–41]. Many PTCs carry a positive charge on their hydrophilic heads[40]. This pos￾itive charge helpsthe PTC to interact with negatively charged speciesin the aqueous
phase,such as anionic reactants or counterions[38]. Some PTCs may have additional
functional groupsin theirstructure that can either participate in the reaction or pro￾vide specific coordination sites. These functional groups can enhance the catalytic
activity or selectivity of the PTC. Sometimes, PTCs include bridging groups that link
the hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic head. These groups can affect the geometry
and flexibility of the PTC molecule, which can change its ability to interact with reac￾tants in different phases. Examples of PTCs include (i) quaternary ammonium salts
(tetra-butylammonium bromide), (ii) phosphonium salts(tetraphenylphosphonium
bromide), and (iii) cationic surfactants.
3.4 Highlights of Micellar Catalysis
Overthe last 15 years, a significant literature has emerged, highlighting the potential
of aqueous micellar technology as a safer alternative to hazardous organic solvents
[20, 24, 33, 43, 44]. Significant contributions from Lipshutz [45–48], Handa [49–53],
Gallou [54–56], Kobayashi [35, 57], and others[48, 58–60] have made notable strides
in advancing this field, demonstrating this approach’s remarkable versatility and
efficacy. Its ability to facilitate valuable chemical transformations with improved
selectivity under sustainable reaction conditions is particularly notable [53, 61, 62].
The application of micellar technology has profoundly influenced various domains
of organic synthesis, including nanocatalysis [63–65], palladium-catalysis [43, 45,
48, 50, 66], amide couplings [52, 67–69], biocatalysis [70–72], and traditional nucle￾ophilic aromatic substitution reactions (SNAr) [73–75]. Furthermore, the scalability3.4 Highlights of Micellar Catalysis 33
of these reactions has been successfully demonstrated in a myriad of industrial pro￾cesses [55, 56, 70, 76–78], primarily in the context of multi-kilogram scale synthesis
of APIs [55, 56, 70, 76, 77].
3.4.1 Micelle-Enabled Cross-Coupling Reactions
The judicious incorporation of micellar technology in conjunction with palladium
catalysis did address some of the contemporary sustainability challenges associated
with cross-coupling chemistry. In the last 15 years, numerous reports in this direc￾tion have extensively addressed the concerns over (i) catalyst loading and their poor
recyclability,(ii) higherreaction temperature,(iii) dependency on hazardous organic
solvents, and (iv) stoichiometry of coupling partners or bases. This section will dis￾cuss such key reports in the context of various cross-coupling reactions.
3.4.1.1 Suzuki–Miyaura Couplings Enabled by Micellar Catalysis
This name reaction involves the C—C bond formation between alkyl/aryl (pseudo)
halides with organoboron compounds in the presence of a base and palladium cata￾lyst, where the easy accessibility and excellent stability of organoboron compounds
with the generation of non toxic byproducts make this technology very attractive to
the synthetic chemists. As highlighted by Brown and Bostrom [79], this reaction has
emerged as the most prevalent palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction in the
field of medicinal chemistry over the past three decades. As a result, considerable
efforts have been focused on developing environmentally friendly variants of these
protocols, given their extensive use in various industrial processes [80, 81].
The first report in this direction appeared in 2008, where Lipshutz and coworkers
employed aqueous nano-micelles of non-ionic amphiphile PTS as the reaction
medium and (dtbpf)PdCl2 as a catalyst developed for cross-couplings by Colacot
and coworker [82] with Et3N as the base to enable the challenging couplings of
aryl halides (iodides, bromides, and chlorides) and boronic acids under milder
conditions in water [83]. Further, with the introduction of a newer Pd precatalyst
(AmPhosPdCl2) [84], this approach was modified to house the coupling of various
heterocyclic substrates, including pyridine, pyrimidinesthiophenes, and oxazolines.
Subsequently, significant reports have appeared to tackle numerous challenges in
this area [43], including the development of tailored ligands and/or precatalysts [45,
85–87], the utilization of nanoparticle (NP) catalysts instead of traditional homoge￾neoussystems[48], as well asthe implementation of flow-reaction processes[88, 89],
and other innovative methodologies [58, 65, 90]. Among these advancements, only
some of the significantly relevant reports will be discussed in this section.
Lipshutz Lab contributed substantially to developing novel ligands/pre-catalysts
to enable this reaction under milder aqueous conditions (Scheme 3.2a) [45, 85, 86,
91]. The first report in this direction appeared in 2015 with the development of the
HandaPhos ligand [45]. The ligand was designed to harness the complete micellar
effect by increasing the hydrophobicity of the ligand, ensuring its distribution in
the hydrophobic micellar inner core. Along with 1000 ppm of Pd(OAc)2, this ligand
enabled cross-coupling of a broad range of electrophiles with boronic acids in the34 3 Chemistry of “In-Water” Reactions: Spotlights on Micellar and Phase-Transfer Catalysis

aqueous micelles of Nok (Scheme 3.2b). Notably, the catalyst and reaction medium
were recyclable for up to four additional cycles without losing significant activity.
By judicious design of the palladacycle backbone in conjunction with the
HandaPhos, the palladium loading can be further reduced to as low as 25 ppm
[91]. Takale and Lipshutz introduced this strategy in 2019, showcasing successful3.4 Highlights of Micellar Catalysis 35
couplings of diverse electrophiles and nucleophiles under aqueous conditions
(Scheme 3.2c). The lipophilicity of the palladacycle was enhanced by introducing
the diisopropyl substitution on the biphenyl group. Separately, the intense synthesis
of HandaPhos ligand has raised concern from a sustainability perspective as it
substantially affects the overall carbon footprint. In addressing these concerns,
Lipshutz developed two ligands, EvanPhos [86] and N2Phos [85], which can be
synthesized easily from readily available starting materials. These ligands enabled
the Suzuki–Miyaura (SM) couplings under mild aqueous conditions with ppm
levels of Pd loadings (Scheme 3.2d).
In 2018, a novel approach to utilizing a PS-750-M-based micellar strategy
was introduced by Handa et al., to overcome the challenges associated with the
couplings of (iso)quinolines [87]. Traditionally, these substrates lead to catalyst
deactivation due to their binding of the nitrogen with the Pd center, impeding
their functionalization via cross-couplings. To address this issue, micellar con￾ditions were employed, using Colacot’s highly active π-allyl palladium catalyst
(PCy3Pd(crotyl)Cl). This approach demonstrated successful couplings on a wide
range of electrophiles (Br, Cl, and OTf) and nucleophiles (BMIDA, BF3K, and
boronic acids). Notably, the expanded substrate scope accommodated various
protective and functional groups, including free OH and NH2 functional groups
(Scheme 3.3a).
The scope of SM coupling is often limited when it comes to sp2–sp3 couplings due
to the possible deteriorating β-hydride elimination pathway in the catalytic cycle.
In 2018, Lipshutz and coworkers presented an elegant solution to this challenge
by introducing alkyl OBBD (B-alkyl-9-oxa-10-borabicyclo[3.3.2]decane) reagents as
an sp3 source [92]. These reagents showcased exceptional stability against moisture
and air, making them well-suited for implementation in micellar processes. Again,
Colacot’s (dtbpf)PdCl2 served as the optimal catalyst. By employing mild micellar
conditions, this approach successfully enabled a multitude of challenging sp2–sp3
couplings (Scheme 3.3b).
Often, the cross-coupling reactions are sensitive to the presence of dissolved oxy￾gen. Proper purging of the micellar medium with argon or nitrogen is typically nec￾essary prior to catalysis to mitigate this challenge. Generally, the dissolved oxygen
hinders the regular catalytic cycle by promoting homo-couplings or deborylation of
nucleophiles. Micellar catalysis offers an innovative solution by providing micellar
inner cores where oxygen is poorly soluble. This enables cross-coupling reactions
to proceed under open-air conditions. This approach was reported from Beverina’s
lab, where the authors demonstrated using BASF’s emulsifier Kolliphor EL for SM
coupling under atmospheric conditions [58]. The emulsifier creates an oxygen-free
hydrophobic inner core, facilitating couplings in open-air environments. The reac￾tion employs (dtbpf)PdCl2 as the catalyst and triethylamine as the base. The versa￾tility of these reaction conditions is showcased through various examples, recycling
studies, and the synthesis of several molecular semiconductor cores (Scheme 3.3c).
In recent studies, the micellar conditions have been utilized to develop
DNA-encoded libraries (DELs), wherein functionalized DNA fragments undergo
arylation using diverse boronic acids [90]. This methodology involves employing36 3 Chemistry of “In-Water” Reactions: Spotlights on Micellar and Phase-Transfer Catalysis

the micelles of TPGS-750-M. This innovative application of micellar catalysis
establishes a promising platform for expanding DELs, subsequently facilitating the
development of novel therapeutic agents (Scheme 3.3d).
Lipshutz and coworkers explored the integration of flow technology with micellar
catalysis to enable sustainable SM couplings [88]. They employed Fe/ppm Pd NPs
(800 ppm) as the catalyst under continuous slurry plug flow conditions. Although
the reaction yield ranged between 88% and 97%, the substrate scope was limited
(no nitrogen heterocycles).
However, in the subsequent paper, a stirred-tank reactor flow setup was utilized
to accommodate the coupling of heteroaromatic substrates under milder micellar
conditions [89]. The continuous flow procedure exhibited compatibility with a wide
range of substrates and delivered excellent reaction yields (Scheme 3.4).
3.4.1.2 C–N Cross-Couplings Enabled by Micellar Catalysis
The cross-couplings of amines with (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides have surfaced as
an efficient method for accessing functionalized aromatic amines and heterocycles
[93]. This process has significant implications across various industrial sectors, as
these structural motifs play crucial roles in natural products, APIs, organic mate￾rials, and catalysts [93, 94]. Over the past 25 years, this approach has evolved into

a fundamental tool for constructing N—C (sp2) bonds. The rapid progress in this
field is attributed to the development of novel pre-catalysts and ligands, guided by
an advanced understanding of the intricate aspects of the reaction mechanism [93,
95, 96]. Compared to the state-of-the-art reports, the micellar variations of these
couplings enable the reaction under milder conditions without relying on toxic or
hazardous solvents and expensive ligands/precatalysts.
The initialreport from Lipshutz’slab employed Takasago’s Di-tert-butyl(1-methyl￾2,2-diphenylcyclopropyl)phosphine (cBRIDP) as a ligand along with [(π-allyl)PdCl]2
as a precursor to effectively catalyze the amination of aryl bromides and chlorides
under mild aqueous conditions using nano micelles of PTS [97]. Building upon this
work, Schmitt and coworkers further expanded this approach to encompass hetero￾cyclic substrates by increasing the temperature and catalyst loading and replacing
the PTS surfactant with TPGS-750-M [98]. Notably, this methodology accommo￾dated the N-arylation of amides, carbamates, and urea derivatives. Further,superior
performance in these C–N cross-couplings was observed when the cBRIDP ligand
was replaced with Buchwald’s biaryl phosphine (t-BuXPhos) (Scheme 3.5) [99].
In a 2019 report, Lipshutz and coworkers employed Colacot’s [t-BuXPhosPd(cin￾namyl)]OTf as a pre-catalyst for the amination of aryl bromides and chlorides
under mild aqueous conditions with ppm levels of [Pd] loadings [100]. This study
showcased a diverse substrate scope while minimizing the carried-over palladium
to the final product. The scalability of this approach was demonstrated in the
organic solvent-free synthesis of 1-(4-((4-fluorophenyl)amino)phenyl)ethan-1-one,
where the pure product was easily obtained via filtration and water washing (to
remove surfactant) (Scheme 3.6).
In C–N cross-couplings, catalysts are often non-recyclable due to the strong bind￾ing of amines with the metal center. Handa and coworkers introduced a novel het￾erogeneous nanocatalytic approach using a charcoal-immobilized bimetallic Pd–Cu
system to address this limitation [65].
The ligand cBRIDP was pivotal in stabilizing the catalytic palladium species,
facilitating the desired reaction under mild aqueous conditions. The scope of
this approach was broad and accommodated the couplings of numerous het￾erocycles, including indoles, piperidine, morpholine, etc. Notably, both the
catalyst and reaction medium showed recyclability for up to three additional
cycles without significant loss of activity (Scheme 3.6). Considering the mild

nature of micellar aminations, this can be leveraged to functionalize temperature￾sensitive biomolecules directly. In a recent study, Waring and coworkers uti￾lized micellar aminations to generate DELs [101]. This approach employed the
cBRIDP:[(cinnamyl)PdCl]2 catalytic system under TPGS-750-M micellar conditions
to investigate the N-arylation of polynucleotides with various substitutions.
3.4.1.3 Sonogashira Couplings Enabled by Micellar Catalysis
Sonogashira couplings employ terminal olefins as nucleophiles to enable C—C
(sp–sp2) bond formation under Pd or Pd–Cu catalysis conditions. In the context of
sustainability, the general reaction conditions are far from ideal. With the intro￾duction of micellar catalysis, most of these challenges were addressed. In the first
report of micelle-enabled Sonogashira coupling, copper was not employed, leading
to the rediscovery of the pioneering “Heck–Cassar” type alkyne arylation conditions
[102]. The catalytic system involved Pd(OAc)2:cBRIDP or (CH3CN)2PdCl2:XPhos,
facilitating the formation of sp2–sp bonds under PTS micellar conditions at room
temperature (Scheme 3.7a).
Subsequently, Lipshutz introduced a practical and versatile method for this reac￾tion utilizing HandaPhosligand and ppm levels of Pd under mild aqueous conditions
[103]. This technology used Et3N base, a 2 wt% aqueous solution of TPGS-750-M40 3 Chemistry of “In-Water” Reactions: Spotlights on Micellar and Phase-Transfer Catalysis

amenable to the coupling of a broad range of electrophiles and nucleophiles, includ￾ing various heterocycles, as well as sensitive protective and other functional groups
(Scheme 3.7b).
Consequently, from a homogeneous catalysis perspective, the cBRIDP-bound Pd
and the Pd–G3 palladacycles of CataCXiumA were identified as effective catalysts
forthese reactions at ppm levels[54, 104]. The reaction conditionsincluded aqueous
nanomicelles of TPGS-750-M and K3PO4 ⋅ H2O or Et3N base.
The cBRIDP-catalyzed couplings displayed smooth and efficient reactions across
a wide range of substrates [104], with excellent catalyst recyclability. By employ￾ing the G3-palladacycle of CataCXiumA [54], the couplings of challenging hete￾rocyclic compounds with free OH groups were achieved with moderate to excel￾lent yields (Scheme 3.8). Notably, Gallou and Ackermann recently provided a com￾prehensive review highlighting the remarkable advancements enabled by micellar
catalysis in Sonogashira–Hagihara couplings. The NP variants of these reactions are
more intriguing and will be discussed in the later section.3.4 Highlights of Micellar Catalysis 41

3.4.1.4 Palladium Catalyzed 𝛂-Arylation Reactions Enabled
by Micellar Catalysis
The [Pd] catalyzed α-arylation of carbonyls or activating groups offers an efficient
method for constructing sp2–sp3 C—C bonds [105, 106]. Generally, the reaction
involves the intermediacy of enolates or carbanion-type species; due to this reason,
chemists believed that such reactions necessitated strictly anhydrous conditions
and were incompatible with aqueous environments. However, micellar catalysis
provides a solution by enabling these reactions under aqueous conditions through
the shielding effect of micelles. The hydrophobic inner cores of micelles act as
a protective shield, preventing the undesired quenching of carbanion species by
bulk-water molecules. This was first demonstrated by Handa and coworkers in 2017
[31]. The authors employed Colacot’s [(t-BuXPhos)Pd(allyl)]OTf as the catalyst to
enable the α-arylation of nitroalkanes with the chiral surfactant PS-750-M. The
enolates from nitroalkanes were generated and consumed in situ by leveraging the
shielding of micelles. The scope of this approach was evaluated over 20 substrates
(Scheme 3.9).
Inspired by these studies, in 2020, Handa and coworkers further expanded the
scope of this understanding by developing a novel nanocatalytic technology for the
α-arylation of phenyl acetonitriles [50]. Here, the reaction conditions employed
the aqueous micelles of PS-750-M and KOH as the base. The nanocatalyst was
also synthesized from Colacot’s crotyl Pd catalysts (XPhosPd(crotyl)Cl). This study
comprehensively evaluated the potential of this approach in enabling this reaction
for a broad range of electrophiles (40+substrates). The authors explored the reac￾tion mechanism employing 31P NMR and successfully detected a carbanion-type

of diphenozylate intermediate (Scheme 3.9).
In a recent study, Lipshutz and coworkers presented a method for the α-arylation
of ketones using [Pd(𝜇-Br)(t-Bu)3P]2 as the catalyst (1250–5000 ppm), KOtBu as the
base, and nano-micelles of TPGS-750-M as the reaction medium (Scheme 3.9) [107].
The reactions proceeded efficiently at 45 ∘C, allowing for the α-arylation of vari￾ous ketones and (hetero)aryl bromides. The resulting α-arylated products have been
successfully applied in various one-pot reactions, highlighting the versatility and
usefulness of this micellar technology.
3.4.1.5 Micellar Nanocatalysis in C–C Couplings
Nanocatalysis has gained significant attention from the synthetic community
as a promising alternative to traditional homogeneous/heterogeneous catalysis
[108–111]. This approach offers attractive features, including catalyst recyclability,
enhanced catalytic activity, improved reaction selectivity, and operationally simple
procedures. The consolidation of micellar catalysis with nanocatalysis, known as
“micellar nanocatalysis,” presents even greener and more sustainable solutions
than conventional nanocatalysis[63, 64]. Afterinitialreportsin the 2000s discussing
the potential of nanocatalysts in surfactant chemistry and cross-coupling reactions
[112, 113], the field remained relatively inactive until pioneering studies by Lipshutz
and Handa highlighting the effectiveness of Fe–ppm Pd NPs for SM couplings [48].
Since that report, the academic interest in this domain has substantially grown,
and various value-added transformations have been demonstrated by leveraging
the basic principles of micellar catalysis [64, 114–116].
The seminal 2015 report demonstrated that the Pd impurity within the FeCl3
salt could enable SM couplings to yield functionalized biaryls (Scheme 3.10a,b)
[48]. With extensive optimizations, the authors concluded that Fe/ppm Pd NPs
can be synthesized from 320 ppm of Pd(OAc)2 as the dopant, SPhos as the ligand,
FeCl3 as the support, and MeMgCl as the reductant. These NPs could catalyze the
carbon–carbon bond formation between highly functionalized aryl halides and
boronic acids under mild aqueous micellar conditions enabled by the designer
surfactant TPGS-750-M. Notably, these NPs are highly recyclable, and the catalytic
activity was retained even after several rounds of recycling along with the reaction
medium. Considering the toxicity of carried-over palladium, this technology was
highly attractive from a pharmaceutical industry perspective. Later, Novartisstudied
the scope of this technology in the context of micellar-flow chemistry [88, 89].
Further, in 2019, the scope of this NP technology was extended to theCu-free Sono￾gashira couplings[114]. In this context, the Fe/ppm Pd NPs were modified by replac￾ing the biaryl ligand SPhos with XPhos and increasing the Pd loading to 500 ppm
(Scheme 3.10c). These new NPs exhibited excellent activity toward this micellar
sp2–sp type cross-coupling with a broad substrate scope. The optimized reaction
conditions employed the aqueous solution of custom-designed tocopherol-derived
TPGS-750-M as the reaction medium and triethyl amine (TEA) as a base, and the
reaction proceeded smoothly under milder conditions(temperature rt-45 ∘C). These
NPs were also recyclable, with an overall E-factor of 4.14.3.4 Highlights of Micellar Catalysis 43

Scheme 3.10 Micellar nanocatalysis in the context of Fe/ppm Pd NPs.44 3 Chemistry of “In-Water” Reactions: Spotlights on Micellar and Phase-Transfer Catalysis
In 2021, Lipshutz and coworkers modified the Fe/ppm Pd NPs recipe by intro￾ducing inexpensive t-Bu3P as the ligand and increasing the Pd loading to 2500 ppm
[115]. These new NPs were highly active toward challenging Heck–Mizoroki
couplings under mild micellar conditions. Here, the micelles of TPGS-750-M played
a crucial role in determining the right shape and geometry of these NPs, making
them effective for the desired transformations. Notably, the reaction demanded 10%
of the reprotoxic solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for improved reaction
yields. This was rationalized by the role of DMF in stabilizing the active NP catalyst
(Scheme 3.10d).
Very recently, Lipshutz and coworkers explored the scope of these NPs as the cat￾alysts for the challenging Negishi-type couplings under mild aqueous conditions
[116]. The optimal catalytic activity was achieved by employing AmPhos as the lig￾and and increasing the Pd loadings up to 2500 ppm. The scope of this approach
was broad, enabling the sp2–sp3-type couplings between highly functionalized alkyl
halides and aryl halides. Along with the catalytic amounts of NPs, the optimal condi￾tions employed are four equivalents of zinc powder and five equivalents of TMEDA
(as the stabilizer for in situ-generated Negishi-type reagents) and 2 wt % aqueous
solution of TPGS-750-M. Notably, the catalytic activity significantly dropped after
the initial cycles, and additional fresh NP addition was required to achieve desirable
conversions (Scheme 3.10e).
From a sustainability perspective, it is essential to note that the carbon footprint
of these ligands is often considered heavy. It will be highly regarded if one can
perform catalysis without relying on these ligands. In this direction, Handa and
coworkers demonstrated the implication of custom-designed proline-derived
amphiphile PS-750-M to promote ligand-free micellar nanocatalysis under mild
aqueous conditions [51, 117–119]. The seminal work reported by Handa and
coworkers in 2021 showcased that the Pd(II) NPs can be stabilized by the carbonyls
of amphiphile PS-750-M and can perform oxidative-Heck-type couplings at room
temperature (Scheme 3.11a) [51]. The interaction between Pd and the carbonyls of
amphiphile was studied using IR and HRMS studies. Further, the scalability of this
approach was demonstrated on a 100 g scale example.
Later, in 2021, they further expanded the scope of this approach toward Pd(0)
catalysis. Notably, the Pd(0) nanocatalysis in the absence of a phosphine ligand is
highly challenging, considering the higher tendency of the Pd(0) surface to aggre￾gate and form catalytically inactive Pd-black [117]. By judiciously leveraging the
structural features of the amphiphile PS-750-M, the authors demonstrated the cat￾alytic activity of the ligand-free Pd(0) NPs under mild aqueous conditions. Here, the
metal–micelle interaction was studied using various spectroscopic tools, including,
IR, 13C NMR, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The NPs effec￾tively enable cross-coupling of aryl-boronic acid with water-sensitive acid chlorides
or aryl iodides under mild aqueous conditions (Scheme 3.11b).
The extensive spectroscopic studies in these reports laid the foundation for
the basic understanding of metal–micelle cooperativity, which became a key
concept in the operational understanding of micellar catalysis [119]. Further, in
2022, this approach was extended toward stabilizing Pd2(dba)3-derived Pd(0) NPs
under ligand-free conditions. Similar to previous reports, the role of PS-750-M in3.4 Highlights of Micellar Catalysis 45

stabilizing Pd(0) NPs was found to be crucial. In this case, the catalytic activity
was demonstrated toward the ketone synthesis employing arylboronic acid and
activated-carboxylic acid adducts (Scheme 3.11c).
Later, in 2022, Handa and coworkers demonstrated the implications of this
“metal–micelle cooperativity concept” in copper catalysis [118]. The authors
reported bench-stable photoactive aqueous nano aggregates of Cu(II) for ppm-level46 3 Chemistry of “In-Water” Reactions: Spotlights on Micellar and Phase-Transfer Catalysis
Cu(I) catalysisin water. The authors developed a modified version of PS-750-M with
an optimal PEG-chain length to enable click chemistry under micellar conditions.
The reaction proceeded smoothly under photo-assisted condition, with one-pot
azidation of electrophiles (benzyl bromides/polyfluoroarenes) followed by the
[3+2] cycloaddition to yield the desired triazoles in good yields (Scheme 3.11d).
3.4.2 SNAr Reactions Employing Micellar Catalysis
SNAr reactions involve the displacement of leaving groups (F, Cl, Br, etc.) by
strong nucleophiles through the intermediacy of Meisenheimer-type complexes
[120]. These reactions are extensively employed in drug discovery programs to
functionalize the aromatic systems by means of C—N, C—C, and C—O bond
formations [121–123]. The SNAr reactions are attractive due to their higher atom
economy and ability to proceed without needing any metals or catalysts. However,
from a sustainability perspective, these reactions require significant re-engineering
due to their reliance on hazardous dipolar aprotic solvents [124, 125].
To address these challenges, modern micellar catalysis strategies have been
employed. Notably, Lipshutz and coworkers developed a general approach employ￾ing TPGS-750-M micelles, enabling the incorporation of oxygen, nitrogen, and
sulfur nucleophiles at ambient orslightly elevated temperatures[126]. This method￾ology demonstrates a broad scope, accommodating various heterocyclic systems
and sensitive functional groups. Moreover, the in-flask recyclability of the reaction
medium was demonstrated, achieving a low E factor value of 4.6–4.8, indicating its
efficiency and minimal waste generation (Scheme 3.12a).

Despite the broad scope, thisreport only allowed SNAr reactionsinvolving neutral
nucleophiles, whereas the charged nucleophiles remained incompatible. This can
be rationalized by the inability of hydrophobic TPGS-750-M micelles to accommo￾date charged nucleophiles inside the micelles. To address this challenge, Handa and
coworkers used micelles of PS-750-M, which have a polarinner core, forthe sulfony￾lations of polyfluoroarenes using sulfinate salts [74]. The addition of 10 equivalents
of NaCl helped in dissolving the sulfinate salt inside the micelles. The optimal con￾ditions also included 10% acetone for fruitful conversion. With the optimal condi￾tions, the researchers evaluated the substrate scope expansion with 24+substrates.
Lithium or sodium salts of aryl and alkyl sulfinic acids showed excellent reactivity.
This method was compatible with a wide range of heterocycles, including pyridine,
thiophene, furan, and lactam. This approach was scalable, and the product mainly
precipitated from the reaction medium, which allowed environmentally responsible
recycling of the reaction medium with an E-factor closer to zero (Scheme 3.12b).
A recent study by Abbvie and Handa demonstrated that the hydrophobic pockets
derived from the aqueous solution of cellulose derivative (hydroxypropyl methyl￾cellulose (HPMC)) can facilitate scalable SNAr reactions under mild aqueous
conditions [73]. Notably, this is one of the most effective methods for installing a
C—N bond in a functionalized aromatic ring. However, since this report does not
fall under the category of micellar catalysis, this chapter will not provide a detailed
discussion on this topic.
3.4.3 Amide Coupling Employing Micellar Catalysis
Amide coupling reactions hold massive significance in medicinal chemistry,
mainly due to the market demand for peptide-based therapeutic agents, which
exceeds 25.4 billion USD globally [127]. Traditionally, these transformations in
the solution phase involve coupling the carboxylic acid with an amine using
stoichiometric coupling or activating reagents in polar aprotic solvents like DMF
or dichloromethane (DCM) [128]. However, the use of such solvents poses sig￾nificant health risks and causes irreparable environmental damage, resulting in
substantial investments in process safety and waste disposal measures [124, 128].
The introduction of micellar technology presents an innovative approach to enable
water-based amide and peptide synthesis under milder conditions [52, 68, 69]. In
2015, Lipshutz and coworkers reported the first micellar strategy employing the
aqueous nanomicelles of TPGS-750-M asthe reaction medium, (1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-
oxoethylidenaminooxy)dimethylamino-morpholinocarbenium hexafluorophos￾phate (COMU) as the coupling reagent, and 2,6-lutidine as the base. This protocol
enabled the amidation of various protected amino acids at room temperature
(Scheme 3.13a) [68]. The scope of this approach was limited by the low reactivity
of aromatic amines. Furthermore, the utility of this method was explored for
peptide synthesis in water, focusing on sequential deprotection and coupling at
the N-terminus in a one-pot fashion. The report successfully synthesized peptides
of up to 10 amino acid units with satisfactory overall yields. In another report
from Lipshutz’s lab, the authors subsequently designed a surfactant molecule,+

MC-1.A, engineered to mimic the essential solvation properties of the polar aprotic
solvent DMSO [69]. This amphiphile facilitated the successful amidation of various
protected amino acids with moderate to excellent yields. Although these procedures
effectively employed water as the primary reaction medium, organic solvents were
still required for product extraction and purification.
A recent report by Handa and coworkers established a completely organic
solvent-free method using the proline-derived PS-750-M amphiphile [52, 67].
The authors leveraged the structural features of the custom-designed amphiphile
to drive the reaction under micellar conditions. Here, the micellar inner core
of PS-750-derived aqueous micelles has an unusual polarity for their micellar
inner core due to the presence of amide bonds in this region; this helps to sol￾ubilize polar reactants like amino acids or peptides (Scheme 3.13b). Utilizing
1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide (EDC) as the coupling reagent
and pyridine as the base, the aqueous micelles of PS-750-M micelles demonstrated
faster amide coupling of amino acids compared to their organic solvent counterparts
(10–40 minutes). Notably, product isolation required only filtration, as the product
precipitates upon completion of the reaction. This organic solvent-free approach
brings organic chemists one step closer to the ideal amide/peptide synthesis. The
generality of this method was confirmed by examining 24 substrates, focusing
on real-life examples, while scalability was demonstrated with 11 gram-scale
reactions. An epimerization study ensured the retention of stereochemistry,
addressing a common issue associated with traditional methods. HPLC analysis
validated the complete retention of stereochemistry, overcoming another chal￾lenging aspect of these reactions. Very recently, authors expanded the scope of
this approach toward the synthesis of two key drug intermediates in a scalable
fashion [67].
Furthermore, Wearing and colleagues explored the efficacy of these micellar
amidations for the functionalization of DNA molecules, broadening the scope
of DELs [129]. Nanomicelles derived from TPGS-750-M were utilized as the
reaction medium to successfully enable the coupling of various heterocyclic or
alkyl amines/acids with functionalized DNA molecules. Carboxylic acid activation
was achieved using HATU, or the combination of N,N-diisopropylcarbodiimide
(DIC) and HOAt. This approach exhibited a broad scope, accommodating various
coupling partners, including amino acids, alkyl amines, and heterocyclic amines,
along with their acid variants (Scheme 3.13c).
3.4.4 Biocatalysis Employing Micellar Catalysis
Biocatalysis presents synthetic chemists with a unique opportunity to enhance
regio-, chemo-, and stereo-selectivity in chemicalsynthesis[130–132]. By employing
specific enzymes for targeted transformations under mild conditions, biocatalysis
presents an exciting alternative to traditional chemo-catalysis. This regime predom￾inantly utilizes water as a solvent, replacing the reliance on toxic/hazardous organic
solvents while providing superior selectivity and improved reaction parameters
under gentle conditions [130, 133]. Due to these reasons, many industrial processes
are adopting this technology to develop greener and efficient chemical processes
[134–136].3.4 Highlights of Micellar Catalysis 51
The integration of micellartechnology with biocatalysis holds enormous potential
and brings organic synthesis closer to ultimate sustainability. This combination
expands substrate compatibility in biocatalysis and enables sequential reaction
pathways involving both chemo- and biocatalysts, laying the foundation for next￾generation organic synthesis [71, 72, 133, 137, 138]. A recent contribution by
Lipshutz and colleagues demonstrates the use of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)
for stereoselective reduction of functionalized ketones under micellar conditions
[137]. Nano-micelles derived from TPGS-750-M facilitate efficient enzyme catalysis
by modulating the degree of enzyme saturation through the solubilization of lipo￾philic reactants in hydrophobic pockets. The study also illustrates the sequential
merging of chemo- and biocatalysis, starting with Pd, Cu, Fe, Rh, and Au-catalyzed
alkyne/olefin functionalization, followed by ADH-catalyzed ketone reduction
(Scheme 3.14a).
The scalability of this approach is showcased by the multi-kilogram-scale synthe￾sis of a chiral 4-piperidinol derivative. Similar TPGS-750-M-based strategies have
been developed for the asymmetric reduction of α,β-unsaturated compounds using
ene-reductase (ERED) [71] and esterification reactions utilizing lipase enzymes[72]
(Scheme 3.14b,c). Notably, no cofactor is required in lipase-mediated esterification,
and the reaction proceeds smoothly with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry of acids and alcohols.
These methodologies enable multiple sequential reactions by combining chemo￾and bio-catalysis [138]. Although this branch of micellar catalysis is still in its
early stages, further research is necessary to establish its underlying principles and
advance its applications.

3.5 Highlights of PTC
3.5.1 Asymmetric Hydroxylation
PTC has been applied to the asymmetric synthesis of α-aryl-α-hydroxy-δ-lactam
derivatives containing a chiral quaternary center (Scheme 3.15). Numerous natural
products and bioactive molecules contain lactams and cyclic amines with chiral
quaternary centers. α-Aryl-α-hydroxy-δ-lactam derivatives are a prominent class of
such compounds [139]. This method involves using a chiral quaternary ammonium
salt as a PTC catalyst, KOH as a base, triethyl phosphite as a reducing agent in water,
and toluene under an oxygen atmosphere. Excellent yield and enantioselectivity
were achieved with only 1 mol% catalyst. The corresponding hydroxylated products
with high enantioselectivities were achieved in moderate to high yields using a
range of α-aryl-δ-lactams bearing p- or m-substituents. Moreover, heteroaryl rings
such as pyridine and thiophene also gave the hydroxylated product good yield and
enantioselectivity under optimized conditions (Scheme 3.15).
3.5.2 Asymmetric SNAr Reactions
Phase transfer-catalyzed asymmetric SNAr reactions of carbonyl compounds have
been well explored over the last two decades. However, it was only applicable to
the electrophiles having strong electron-withdrawing arenes. To broaden the scope,
Maruoka and coworkers developed a chiral phase-transfer catalyst modified with
binaphthyl, which efficiently facilitated the SNAr reaction between α-amino acid
derivatives and chromium complexes derived from electron-rich fluoroarenes,
resulting in the formation of highly enantioselective α-α-disubstituted α-amino
acids [140]. In addition to simple alkyl-substituted α-amino acid derivatives, such
as phenylalanine and allylglycine, other amino acid derivatives were also well
tolerated under reaction conditions. Furthermore, high enantioselectivity was also
observed with methionine, serine, and glutamic acid derivatives (Scheme 3.16).

3.5.3 Alkylation of 3-Arylpiperidin-2-ones
The chiral quaternary carbon centers are a common feature in nitrogen heterocycles
found in natural products, playing a significant and beneficial role as essential
building blocks in organic synthesis. For example, 3-alkyl-3-aryl piperidine is
the one frequently found in biologically active compounds. Nevertheless, there
have been limited successful reports on the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of
3-alkyl-3-aryl-lactams to date, such as those involving Pd-catalyzed allylation
and conjugate addition under phase-transfer conditions. In 2020, the Maruoka
group developed a catalytic asymmetric alkylation of 3-arylpiperidin-2-ones under
phase-transfer conditions[141]. In the presence of 1 mol% chiral quaternary ammo￾nium salt as a catalyst, the reactions of N-2,2-diarylvinyl-protected 3-aryl-lactams
with diverse alkyl bromides provided the corresponding product in moderate to
good yields and high enantioselectivities (Scheme 3.17).

Scheme 3.18 Csp3—Csp3 bond formation through the synergistic effect of Palladium and
PTC.
Csp3—Csp3 coupling with stabilized nucleophiles, primarily due to the competition
from a single-catalysis pathway. To solve this issue, Zi and coworkers developed a
new method for stereodivergent construction of Csp3—Csp3 bonds having vicinal
stereocenters by synergistic palladium and PTC. (Scheme 3.18) [142]. The reaction
involves 1,3-dienes and oxindoles as coupling partners, quaternary phosphonium
salts as a PTC, and bidentate bisphosphite as a ligand. In the course of this reaction,
one can achieve the selective production of both syn and anti-coupling products
with good yields and excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivities. This study marks
a groundbreaking achievement as the first successful application of metal/PTC
synergistic catalysis in the realm of stereodivergent synthesis. The effectiveness of
the catalyst is dependent on merging the non-covalent interaction of a stabilized
nucleophile with an allylic substitution of a π-allyl-Pd electrophile in a biphasic
system.
3.5.5 Enantioselective 𝛂-Benzoxylation
The first enantioselective α-benzoxylation of malonic diesters promoted by a
phase-transfer catalyst was developed by the Itoh group in 2016 [143]. When
benzoyl peroxide and N-(9-anthracenylmethyl) cinchonium chloride were added
to the α-monosubstituted malonate, the reaction produced the corresponding
α,α-disubstituted compounds with high enantioselectivity and excellent yields. This
technology was also applied to synthesize the receptor antagonist mineralocorticoid
(Scheme 3.19).
3.5.6 Ionic Liquids (ILs) in Phase-Transfer Catalysis
Ionic liquids are a special type of organic salt that remain liquid at low tempera￾tures, typically less than 100 ∘C. Unlike regular salts with high melting points, ILs
can stay in a liquid state over a broad range of temperatures, making them appealing
for different applications.3.5 Highlights of PTC 55

Scheme 3.19 PTC-mediated enantioselective α-benzoxylation.
The primary characteristic of ILs is their ionic nature. They consist of negatively
charged ions (anions) and positively charged ions (cations), which are held together
by electrostatic forces. The combination of various cations and anions can lead to a
wide range of ILs, each with unique properties.
ILs are one of the characteristic types of PTC, composed entirely of ions, and have
exceptional physical and chemical properties, including low vapor pressure and high
thermal stability. Among them, room temperature ILs specifically have become a
widely explored category of ILs that hold promise as an eco-friendly substitute for
traditional organic solvents [144]. Moreover, they present a green alternative to the
utilization of conventional organic solvents. A subtype known as protic ionic liq￾uids has also gained popularity in the scientific community [145]. The molecular
framework of these compounds, featuring protic hydrogens, establishes an extensive
network of hydrogen bonds that prove advantageous across various applications.
In 1914, Paul Walden reported on ILs, specifically the protic ionic liquid ethyl
ammonium nitrate. However, this groundbreaking discovery remained overlooked
mainly by chemists until the late 1970s, when John Nardi and his team rediscov￾ered the potential of ILs [146]. Cammarate and coworkers demonstrated that ILs
interact with water through hydrogen bonding [147]. Moreover, the amphiphilic
nature of imidazolium-based ILs has been discovered. Lourenco and Afonso were
investigating the catalytic potential of ILs, using 1-N-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
hexafluorophosphate as a reaction medium [148]. Later, polymer-supported ILs
were developed and applied for nucleophilic substitutions, such as fluorination
[149]. In 2017, Dong Wook Kim’s team introduced dicationic ionic liquids and
applied them as phase transfer catalysts in a sequence of fluorination reactions
where β-elimination byproduct formation was also studied, a common challenge
in conventional PTC systems [150]. Notably, the use of hexa-EG-DHIM as a catalyst
exhibited excellent chemoselectivity and higher yields. ILs have been applied for a
variety of reactions, such as hydrogenation, etherification, esterification, oxidation,
epoxidation, polymerization, and organometallic coupling reactions.
In 2017, Sepúlveda et al. presented an innovative strategy for biphasic hydrogena￾tion using ILs [151]. The approach involved using isopropanol as the sole hydrogen56 3 Chemistry of “In-Water” Reactions: Spotlights on Micellar and Phase-Transfer Catalysis

donor without bases and generating the Ru catalytic species in situ. This method
eliminates the need for specialized equipment for high-pressure hydrogen gas and
avoids the use of strong bases, making it both environmentally benign and opera￾tionally simple.
Subsequently, Li and colleagues created a bifunctional catalyst by anchoring
Pd(OAc)2 onto the surface of the polymer [152]. This catalyst demonstrated
efficient performance on Suzuki couplings and asymmetric hydrogenation in
water through the formation of nano micelles. Notably, it selectively catalyzed the
Suzuki couplings at high temperatures, while reduction was observed at lower
temperatures. This methodology enabled a one-pot, two-step synthetic route for
arylation and asymmetric reduction, utilizing the enantioselective bifunctional
catalyst (Scheme 3.20).
3.6 Conclusion
In this chapter, we delve into the advancements in performing organic synthesis
using safe solvents under micellar catalysis and PTC. Although both methods allow
reactions to occur in aqueous conditions, they each have unique ways of facilitating
the desired transformations. Micellar catalysis holds great promise as an alternative
to using hazardous solvents such as DMF, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and
dioxane, offering a sustainable and eco-friendly option. The industry is actively
exploring its potential in chemical process development, recognizing its many
benefits in reducing the carbon footprint associated with chemical synthesis. In a
similar vein, PTC has significantly contributed to advancing asymmetric organic
synthesis, providing practical solutions for challenging synthetic problems. The
technologies involving micellar catalysis and PTC are clearly paving the way to
make synthetic chemistry more sustainable and greener.

Physicochemical Aspects of “On-Water” and “In-Water”
Reactions
Rachel Napier and Bao N. Nguyen
University of Leeds, School of Chemistry, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK
4.1 Introduction
The term “on-water reactions” was defined by Sharpless as reactions where insolu￾ble reactant(s) are stirred in aqueous emulsions orsuspensions without the addition
of any organic cosolvents [1]. The key attribute for these reactions is the lack of
solubility of the reactant(s) in water. The term “in-water” was coined by Hayashi
to refer to reactions performed under dilute conditions in water or buffer solution
in which the reactants are completely soluble. However, “on-water”, “in-water”,
and other terms, e.g. “in the presence of water”, have been used interchangeably
in the literature to describe widely different reaction conditions [2, 3], which
has caused significant confusion in this field of research. These definitions and
conditions can have an important impact on the sustainability of the chemical
processes they are based on, as demonstrated by Blackmond and Armstrong [4].
More importantly, they can significantly influence and guide the rational discovery
of new water-accelerated reactions, compared to the same reactions performed
in organic solvents, and green processes through mechanistic understanding.
An example is the tandem aldehyde oxidation/Passerini reaction reported by
Vigalok et al. (Scheme 4.1) [5]. Water-insoluble aldehyde 1 gave only Passerini
product 4, while partially soluble aldehydes gave a mixture of both Passerini
product 4 and the oxidation/Passerini product 3. The authors concluded that the
different pathways in which a reaction can proceed depend on the “in-water” and
“on-water” conditions. Crucially, the rate of oxidation of aldehyde 1 by air is clearly
dependent on the conditions. The solubility of oxygen in water is well known to be
very low (2.56 × 10−4 M in air at 25 ∘C) [6], and a multiphase system with a larger
surface area may be beneficial in promoting masstransfer of oxygen and subsequent
oxidation of the aldehyde.
Despite the binary definitions for “in-water” and “on-water” above, real reactions
can be much more complex. Many water-accelerated reactions(a blanket term refer￾ring to all reactions, which proceed faster when performed in water compared to
when performed in an organic solvent) require and/or produce a base or an inor￾ganic salt. This modifies the ionic strength of the aqueous solution, which, in turn,

influences the solubility of the reactants and products and their phase behaviors.
As the reaction progresses, the increasing amount of product may also introduce a
new phase into the reaction mixture, changing whatstarted as an “in-water” reaction
into an “on-water” reaction.
In this chapter, we will discuss the physicochemical aspects of these intriguing
and important reactions, particularly focusing on their phase behaviors and how
this influences reaction kinetics, mechanisms, and ultimately, process green
metrics. Nomenclature-wise, the reactions will be referred to as “water-accelerated
reactions” for simplicity. Surfactant-enabled reactions, a uniquely exciting area
of research, will be the topic of another chapter. Reactions that employ a mixture
of organic solvent(s) and water will also not be covered due to their extremely
broad nature.
4.2 Phase Behaviors of Realistic Reactions
4.2.1 Complex and Substrate-Dependent Phase Behaviors
The first example of a water-accelerated reaction, reported by Breslow et al. was a
Diels–Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and methyl vinyl ketone, the latter
of which has good solubility in water [7]. Thus, one can reasonably expect the
reaction mixture to consist of an emulsion of cyclopentadiene as the organic phase
in water, and methyl vinyl ketone partitioning between the two phases. Directly
evaluating whether the reaction happens inside the emulsion droplets or at the
organic–water interface is nontrivial when at least one reactant can partition across
the different phases. Nguyen and coworkers summarized the different partitioning
of reactive species in a non-catalytic reaction mixture into four general scenarios
(Figure 4.1) [8].
Scenario (a) is a strictly “on-water” reaction, although very few reported reactions
fully qualify for this, as many of the reagents in organic synthesis are at least
partially soluble in water. Scenario (b) is much more common, as in the Diels–Alder
reaction reported by Breslow. In this case, there can be competition between the
reaction within the organic emulsion, which can have a high effective concentration
of the reactants due to the lack of solvent, and the reaction that happens at the
organic–water interface, which can be accelerated through stabilization of the
transition state via hydrogen bonding with water molecules. Breslow estimated a
maximum fourfold increase in concentration inside the organic droplets compared4.2 Phase Behaviors of Realistic Reactions 65

to organic solvents, which cannot explain the several-hundredfold increase in
reaction rate observed in his reactions [7]. In scenarios (c) and (d), the reaction
between reactants A and B must unambiguously happen at the water–organic
interface, and the reaction rate may be mass-transfer-limited. An example of (d) is
the Henry reaction, first reported by Rao and later extensively studied by Nguyen
(Scheme 4.2) [8, 9].

In this reaction, the enolization of nitromethane 6 is catalyzed by water and takes
place in the aqueous phase due to the high solubility of nitromethane in water.
The enolate must then meet N-methylisatin 5 at the water–organic interface for the
nucleophilic attack and subsequent steps to form the final product.
When a catalyst is included, the system becomes predictably even more
complex. Kobayashi and coworkers outlined seven different scenarios based on the
distribution of the catalyst and substrates in the organic and aqueous phases
(Figure 4.2) [10].
Finally, the phase behavior of the reaction mixture may change as the reaction
progresses, depending on the solubility of the reactants and products in water and
on the way the reaction is performed. An example of this is the base-mediated
cyclization reaction of propargyl pyridinium salt 8 into imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 9,
a pharmacophore, reported by Willans and Nguyen (Scheme 4.3) [11]. On a 10 g
scale, the reaction was performed by slowly adding the starting material 8, a partially
water-soluble powder, into a vigorously stirred aqueous solution of NaOH. As the
reaction progressed and more of the product was formed, a buildup of organic
phases was observed, altering the number of phases and the “in-water”/“on-water”
nature of the reaction (Figure 4.3). The product 9 solidified upon removal of the
aqueous layer, giving an analytically pure product without further purification.66 4 Physicochemical Aspects of “On-Water” and “In-Water” Reactions

4.2.2 Effect of Salts
One of the key early observations that Breslow reported was the impact of salt
additives on the reaction rate in water-accelerated reactions [7]. Using LiCl (4.9 M)
instead of pure water as the reaction medium led to a 2.5 times increase in reaction
rate, while a guanidinium chloride (4.9 M) solution gave no rate increase when4.2 Phase Behaviors of Realistic Reactions 67

compared to water. These observations were explained by the “salting out” effect of
LiCl, i.e. its ability to push out nonpolar materials from water, and the “salting in”
effect of guanidinium chloride (Table 4.1), i.e. its ability to change the structure of
water so that it decreases hydrophobic interactions and increases the solubility of
nonpolar materials [12].
This observation has often been tested and exploited in the literature of
water-accelerated reactions [13]. The rationale was that the higher ionic strength of
the aqueous phase reduces the solubility of the reactants and pushes them together
into the organic emulsion droplets, leading to higher effective concentration and
faster reaction. The logical problem here is that: (i) in many reactions, at least
one reactant is significantly water soluble; and (ii) there is a limit on the effective
concentration of reactants inside the organic droplets, which will be quickly
reached. Breslow estimated the concentration under neat droplet conditions to be
four times that of organic solvent, which can account for a 16 times increase of
reaction rate but not the >700 times increase observed under water-accelerated
reaction conditions [7]. Lastly, the literature includes cases wherein the chemical68 4 Physicochemical Aspects of “On-Water” and “In-Water” Reactions

Maltby et al. [8]/American Chemical Society/CC BY 4.0.
nature of the salt, rather than its impact on the ionic strength of the aqueous phase,
can have a significant effect on the reaction rate. For example, the reaction in
Scheme 4.1 was found to proceed significantly faster in a solution of Na2SO4 instead
of a solution of NaOTs [5].
The complex salt effects can, at least partially, be attributed to the partition of
the starting materials/reagents and the direct involvement of the salt in the reac￾tion mechanism, e.g. a proton transfer step. In the Henry reaction in Scheme 4.2,
the effect of salts on the reaction kinetics was studied in detail (Figure 4.4).
In this reaction, all chloride salts (NaCl, LiCl, and Bu4NCl) resulted in a similar
decrease in reaction rate due to the increased ionic strength of the aqueous phase
and the decreased aqueous solubility of nitromethane. This led to a slower enoliza￾tion of nitromethane 6, which was the rate-determining step (RDS) (vide infra). On
the other hand, using an aqueous phosphate buffer at pH 7 instead of water led to a
very rapid reaction, thanks to the well-documented ability of a phosphate anion to
act as a proton transfer reagent/catalyst in the enolization of nitromethane [14, 15].
An unexpected result was obtained with sodium sulfate as an additive. Sodium sul￾fate is better than NaCl at salting out nitromethane from the aqueous phase, and
its addition should have resulted in a slower reaction [16], but an acceleration in
reaction rate was observed instead. A DFT study by Nguyen explained this by the
catalytic activity of HSO4
−, which is present in minute concentrations at pH 7, in the
enolization of nitromethane (vide infra).
4.3 Mechanistic Considerations
The discussion above on the effects of salt brings our attention to the mechanistic
aspects of water-accelerated reactions. Despite the obvious sustainability benefits
of these reactions, mechanistic understanding based on experimental evidence is4.3 Mechanistic Considerations 69
scarce. Neither of the two most common mechanistic tools for organic chemistry,
i.e. spectroscopic observation of intermediates and kinetic modeling of the reaction,
are readily applicable to these complex systems, which are subjected to a mixture of
physical and chemical controls. NMR characterization of intermediates is difficult
due to the multiphasic reaction mixture and the inaccessible lower temperature
in D2O (melting point 3.8 ∘C). Kinetic profiling of these reactions is nontrivial,
again due to their multiphasic nature and the difficulties in reproducing the mixing
efficiency and temperature control using standard equipment in organic chemistry
laboratories. Finally, reported water-accelerated reactions include many types
of organic reactions, e.g. pericyclic [17, 18], multicomponent [13], nucleophilic
ring-opening [19–21], Mannich [22], aldol [23], Henry reactions [24], Lewis
acid-catalyzed reactions [24], and organocatalytic reactions [18, 25], which follow
very different mechanisms, with very different partitioning of reactants across
the water–organic interface and phase behaviors. Thus, a deterministic view of
a single model to explain the acceleration effect of water is unlikely to explain
these reactions.
4.3.1 Rate Determining Steps
The clearly complex nature of water-accelerated reactions means that the RDS can
be different between different reactions or even the same reaction under different
conditions. Based on the current reported examples where water acceleration can
be experimentally confirmed, the RDS can be one of the following:
(i) Mass transfer of the reactants to the water–organic interface
(ii) Intrinsic chemical RDS without the involvement of water molecules
(iii) Intrinsic chemical RDS with the involvement of water molecules
These different types of water-accelerated processes will be discussed in detail in
the sections below.
4.3.1.1 Mass Transfer of the Reactants to the Water–Organic Interface as the
Rate Determining Step
These are reactions where rate acceleration happensthrough interaction of the tran￾sition state with water molecules near the water–organic interface (scenario (b), (c),
and (d) in Figure 4.1). Thus, the reaction rate depends on the availability of the
reactants near the interface, and the reaction kinetics are mixing dependent. These
reactions should show different rate increases with different mixing powers and a
zero-order reaction at low mixing power, i.e. the reaction rate is limited by the sur￾face area. In cases where the reactants are partitioned into different phases, a phase
transfer catalyst will effectively accelerate the reaction.
Huck provided important experimental evidence of this type of process with the
innovative use of plug flow reactors [26]. By controlling the ratio of the organic
and aqueous stream flow rates at the mixing point (a polychlorotrifluoroethylene
junction), the size of the organic droplets/plugs in the flow tubing was precisely
controlled. There was also no cross-mixing between the droplets, making the
design ideal to study the effect of mass transfer to the water–organic interface in70 4 Physicochemical Aspects of “On-Water” and “In-Water” Reactions

showed strong dependence on the surface-to-volume ratio of the droplet, highlight￾ing the mass-transfer RDS in these reactions (Figure 4.5). It is worth noting that due
to the biphasic nature of these water-accelerated reactions, the concentration terms
used for rate equations can be misleading, and percentage conversion or effective
concentration/organic loading have frequently been used instead.

An example is the Henry reaction in Scheme 4.2 [8]. The kinetics of the reaction
are pseudo-zero order, in the presence of excess nitromethane. When the effective
loading (concentration is an imprecise term when the organic reagents are not all
soluble in water) of all reagents was increased two times in a phosphate buffer at
pH 7, the reaction rate did not increase (Figure 4.6). At this high loading, similar
to the effective concentration used in industrial processes, the mass transfer of the
enolized nitromethane in the aqueous phase to the emulsion interface is the RDS
and is only dependent on temperature and mixing power.
4.3.1.2 Intrinsic Chemical Rate Determining Step Without Involvement
of Water Molecules
This class of water-accelerated reactions refers to those that are accelerated entirely
based on the concentration effect of having all the organic materialsinside emulsion
droplets (scenario (a) in Figure 4.1). Predictably, reliably proven examples are very
few. Nevertheless, Butler and Coyne reported an intriguing reaction, wherein a
1,3-dipole undergoes a [3+2] reaction with an enone (Figure 4.7) [27]. Depending
on the solubility of the enone in water, the reaction was observed to be “in-water”
or “on-water”; however, this was an unaided visual observation instead of a
microscopic observation. In either case, the reaction yield did not differ signifi￾cantly between reactions performed neat or in MeCN, water, or D2O (Table 4.2).
The authors also found that adding HClO4 or LiClO4 at different concentrations
had little effect on the reaction.
The lack of an apparent interaction between the reaction and the aqueous phase
was probed with kinetic isotope effect experiments for the reactions between the72 4 Physicochemical Aspects of “On-Water” and “In-Water” Reactions

respectively, in H2O and D2O. In either case, a very small observable kinetic isotope
effect was detected, confirming that the reaction did not involve water molecules or
interact with the aqueous phase (Figure 4.8).
4.3.1.3 Intrinsic Chemical Rate Determining Step with Involvement of Water
Molecules
A more common scenario is where water is involved in the chemical RDS of the
reaction. This provides a way of explaining the water-acceleration effect through
hydrogen bonding of the water molecules to the transition state and/or water acting4.3 Mechanistic Considerations 73

as a proton transfer reagent in the transition state. It is important to note that this
explanation is not excluded from reactions that have mass transfer as the RDS,
as explained in Figure 4.12 (vide infra). The clearest indications of this scenario are:
(i) A higher acceleration of reaction rate than that which can be accounted for by
the concentration effect in neat droplets.
(ii) A non-zero-order kinetics.
(iii) A primary kinetic isotope effect between water and D2O.
One example is the 1,4-addition of a malonate ester to trans-β-nitrostyrene,
catalyzed by cinchona-based squaramide catalysts reported by Song (Figure 4.9)
[28]. The authors found that using brine solution instead of dichloromethane led to
a significant increase in the reaction rate of a non-zero-order reaction. The reaction
time under water-accelerated reaction conditions is still 16 hours, ensuring that
mass transfer is not the slowest step. Importantly, the two catalysts, QN-SQA and
HQN-SQA, perform similarly in dichloromethane, but HQN-SQA gives a much
faster reaction than using QN-SQA in brine. The more hydrophobic nature of
HQS-SQA may have an impact on the interaction between the transition state of the
RDS with water molecules, leading to the observed decrease in activity. The same
group also observed improved stereoselectivity in asymmetric additions of thiols to
phenylglyoxal, wherein the selectivity was attributed to the attenuation of the water
content at the water–organic interface [29].
Another example is the Cu-catalyzed C–N coupling reaction between
5-nitroindole and iodobenzene, reported by Patil and coworkers (Figure 4.10)
[30]. The reaction was found to proceed more rapidly in a mixture of water and
dimethoxy ethylene (15% DME/H2O, k =3 × 10−5 s−1)than in DME (k =3 × 10−6 s−1)
or DMSO, using KOH as the base. Non-zero-order kinetics was observed, consistent
with the long reaction time (20 hours), which rules out the mass transfer limit.
It is worth noting that reactions that have chemical RDS, which are relatively
slow in both examples above, can switch to mass transfer RDS if the chemical74 4 Physicochemical Aspects of “On-Water” and “In-Water” Reactions

RDS is sufficiently accelerated through increased effective concentration, higher
temperature, or a more active catalyst, or if the mass transfer rate is decreased due
to slower mixing or increased viscosity. Thus, kinetic findings must be treated with
care when significant changes to the reaction conditions or equipment are applied.
The Henry reaction in Scheme 4.2 was found to have a kinetic isotope effect of
kH2O∕kD2O = 2.41 indicating a chemical RDS [8]. However, when the conditions
were changed to a phosphate buffer (significantly increasing the reaction rate),4.3 Mechanistic Considerations 75
using a lower excess of nitromethane, and an increased organic loading, the reaction
was found to be mass transfer limited (Figure 4.6).
Finally, the interaction between the water molecules and the transition state can
reasonably be expected to lead to a change in the chemo-,regio-, and stereoselectivity
of the reaction compared to those obtained when performing in a non-interacting
organic solvent. Examples have been reported for Passerinireactions[5, 31], Michael
reactions [32], epoxide ring opening [33], and condensation [34].
4.3.2 Computational Studies of Water-Accelerated Reactions
Given the complexity of water-accelerated reactions and the difficulties in delineat￾ing the various effects of concentration, proton transfer, stabilization of transition
states, and mass transfer, computational chemistry is an important tool in obtain￾ing a fundamental understanding of these reactions. The widespread use of DFT
modeling and increasing computational power allow researchers to directly probe
the effect of water molecules on the transition state of the RDS in various reac￾tions. Water involvement as a proton transfer reagent has been demonstrated with
many reactions, under water-accelerated conditions or otherwise [35–37]. In this
section, we can only highlight a few selected examples to illustrate important points
on the methodology, their role in explaining experimental observations, and their
limitations.
In 2012, Adamo and coworkers carried out a benchmark study of DFT methods
on the structure and kinetics of a number of simple proton transfer reactions [38]. A
range of DFT functionals were compared to the reference CCSD/cc-pVTZ method,
using the basis set 6-311+G(2d,p) for optimizations and 6-311+G(3df,3pd) for single
point calculations. The results indicated that 𝜔B97X, B1LYP, BMK, and PBE0-DH
were the best performing functionals, and a compromise needed to be made between
accurate structure and accurate energy. One of the most significant improvements
in DFT methods since 2012, which is relevant to hydrogen bonding, is the imple￾mentation of improved dispersion correction DFT-D3 in most common molecular
modeling software [39]. However, due to the low symmetry and multi-molecule
nature of the water-stabilized transition states, high-level DFT calculations are quite
prone to failure. Thus, early literature on computationalstudies of water-accelerated
reactions must be viewed in this context.
Most DFT studies of water-accelerated reactionsfocused on calculating the change
in the activation energy barrier (ΔΔG‡), going from organic solvents into water/
organic conditions. These water-accelerated conditions are represented by explicit
water molecules, which can directly interact with the transition state, often through
hydrogen bonding, and stabilize the developing charges or charge separation.
Jorgensen and coworkers carried out the first ab initio calculations (MP2/6-31G*)
for the aqueous Diels–Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene 30 and butenone 31
by using one explicit water molecule in 1994 (Scheme 4.5, reaction (1)) [40]. They
found that the transition state with hydrogen bonding between water and butenone76 4 Physicochemical Aspects of “On-Water” and “In-Water” Reactions

is 1.5–2.0 kcal mol−1 more favorable than the one without. Jung and Marcus
reported their DFT studies in 2007, using a relatively low-level functional and basis
set, i.e. B3LYP/6-31+G(d), by current standards [41]. For the reaction between
DMAD 33 and quadricyclane 10 (Scheme 4.5, reaction (2)), a ΔG‡ = −7.5 kcal mol−1
was obtained going from neat conditionsto aqueoussurface conditions by including
three water molecules in the transition state (Figure 4.11). A recent DFT study
by Nguyen showed that M06-2x/def2-SVP method can reasonably reproduce the
observed rate acceleration in reaction for both of these reactions and a Claisen
rearrangement (Scheme 4.5, reaction (3)), which were published together in the
seminal publication by Sharpless [1, 8]. Other than the more accurate DFT method,
four water molecules were included in the transition states for reactions (1) and
(2) instead of one and three, respectively. This highlights a key challenge in DFT
studies of water-accelerated reactions: there is no specific guideline on the right
number of water molecules, and choosing involves trial-and-error experimentation
with the transition state. A comprehensive comparison between different numbers
of water molecules is still potentially prohibitive in the near future. The other
practical challenge in these studies, which is perhaps less discussed, is the selection
of the solvent (water vs. organic solvent) and solvent models in modeling software
packages. Again, there is little consensus and the solubility of each reactant may
significantly influence this decision.
Despite these challenges, DFT studies can provide valuable insights into
water-accelerated reactions. Nguyen and coworkers used the DFT calculated
ΔG‡ to explain the unusual acceleration effect of Na2SO4, despite its well-known
salting out effect, in their Henry reaction. Even at pH 7, a small concentration of
[HSO4
−] = 10−5 M is expected in the aqueous phase, and DFT studies showed a
7.1 kcal mol−1 decrease in ΔG‡ for the reaction catalyzed by water molecules vs. the
reaction catalyzed by HSO4

4.4 Green Processes Based on Water-Accelerated
Reactions
While the full discussion of the green chemistry aspects of water-accelerated
reactions is covered elsewhere in this book, it is impossible to discuss their physico￾chemical details without discussing theirimpact on the sustainability of the process.
Performing a reaction using water as the reaction medium does not automatically
make the chemical process based on that reaction, which includes workup, purifi￾cation of the product, and waste disposal, a green process. The sustainability of
water-accelerated processes needs to be made in a holistic manner for the whole
process, using currently accepted green metrics, if not Life Cycle Assessment.
Water-accelerated reactions do inherently have the benefit of improved space-time
yield (STY) due to the higher reaction rate, particularly if higher loadings of organic
materials can be used without compromising the purity of the product. The use of
water as a reaction medium is also highly beneficial if it can replace hazardous sol￾vents such as carbon tetrachloride, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, or dimethylacetamide.
Nevertheless, the workup and purification of water-accelerated reactions must be
carefully assessed when considering their green credentials.
Unless the organic product can be readily separated from the aqueous phase in
high purity, as shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.13 [11, 28], an organic extraction with
additional organic solvent islikely required at the workup stage. Thus, the partition￾ing of the starting materials and the product in the extraction, not necessarily during
the reaction, can have a significant impact on process massintensity (PMI) [42].If an
excess of a starting material is used or the reaction yield is not near quantitative,
the product will require further purification, and the aqueous phase may be con￾taminated with organic compounds. The latter can have a significant impact on the
possibility of waterrecycling, which is highly desirable for green synthetic processes.

However, when these complications are overcome, truly sustainable processes can
be developed, as demonstrated in the continuous flow version of the reaction in
Figure 4.2, giving PMI = 4 and STY = 0.64 kg L−1 h−1 [10].
Lastly, a new class of “on-water” reactions has emerged in recent years based on
photochemical reactions[43–46]. These exploit the near transparent nature of water
in the near UV and visible regions, rather than just the water-acceleration effect.
They are beyond the scope of this current chapter but will be a worthy topic for
review in the future.
4.5 Summary and Conclusions
Water-accelerated reactions, which include a diverse list of organic transformations,
have great potential in green chemical manufacturing processes. Perhaps because
of that, their physicochemical aspects can be very complex and not necessarily
static for the duration of the reactions. The general consensus is that, in most cases,
interaction of the transition state with water molecules leads to lower activation
energy barriers and the rate acceleration effect, which are well described by modern
molecular modeling techniques. Examples of the purely concentration effect inside
the organic emulsions are known, but few. The partition of reactants and products
in the organic and aqueous phases can lead to different physicochemical scenarios,
which may lead to mass transfer to the water–organic interface being the RDS.
This partition and phase behavior are also dependent on the reaction conditions,
particularly the amount of organic materials being put into water. The same
partitioning and solubility of reactants and products are critical in designing
effective workup/purification protocols to achieve truly sustainable chemical
processes.

5.1 Introduction
Carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bond activation has emerged as a transformative strategy
in organic synthesis, revolutionizing the way complex molecules are assembled
[1]. Historically, organic reactions have been relied on the pre-functionalization
of substrates, leading to inefficiencies in both synthetic pathways and waste
generation. However, the advent of C–H activation methodologies has provided
chemists with a powerful tool to directly access and functionalize inert C–H bonds,
thereby streamlining synthetic routes and reducing environmental footprint. To this
end, chemists have designed and implemented strategies utilizing transition metal
catalysis to achieve the C–H bond activation, thus propelling the advancement
of various valuable chemical transformations. This research field is undoubtedly
one of the fastest-growing areas, for addressing both synthetic efficiency and the
enduring sustainability of chemical processes [2].
Traditionally, organic chemists have depended on organic solvents derived from
fossil sources to develop organic chemical reactions [3]. The research on C–H bond
activation has also naturally been conducted in organic solvents. As the concerns
mount over the exhaustion of nonrenewable fossil resources and the environmental
challenges linked to pollutions, the necessity for sustainable development has gar￾nered increasing consensus within the chemistry community [4]. Shifting toward
product development from renewable resources and enhancing utilization efficiency
emerge as crucial strategies for advancing chemical sustainability for the future [5].
In response to this trend, recent progress has extended chemical transformations to
include aqueous settings, marking significant shift toward greener and more sus￾tainable synthetic methods [6].
Water, abundant and environmentally benign, offers a unique advantage as a
solvent. However, using water as a solvent also brings significant challenges for
organic transformations, especially for those transition-metal-catalyzed reactions

the breakdown of the metal-carbon bonds. Balancing the benefits and challenges
requires thoughtful design with the consideration of the specific transition metals
used, reaction conditions, and the desired outcome [8]. Nevertheless, researchers
have unlocked novel strategies for catalyzing C–H bond activation with transition
metals under aqueous conditions [9]. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive
overview of the recent developments in this rapidly evolving field, emphasizing the
transformative impact of aqueous-phase C–H activation on the future of sustainable
chemical synthesis, especially in terms of atom economy [10], step economy [11],
and the E-factor [12].
5.2 C–H Bond Activation Reactions in Aqueous Medium
5.2.1 Activation of sp C–H Bonds
Over the past few decades, significant progress has been made in the field of
transition-metal-catalyzed aqueous C–H bond activation. Due to their higher acid￾ity, C(sp)–H bonds are particularly amenable to activation in aqueous environments.
For instance, the well-known Sonogashira reaction was successfully conducted
in aqueous media in the early 1990s [13]. Initially developed for small-molecule
organic synthesis, the Sonogashira coupling also serves as a valuable tool for poly￾mer synthesis, enabling the design and creation of tailored polymer architectures
with desired properties. In 1998, Li’s group reported the synthesis of arylethynylene
polymer at high molecular weight in the aqueous medium with reversible hydrogel
properties (Scheme 5.1) [14]. Subsequently, the investigation into the activation of
C(sp)–H bonds in aqueous environments experienced rapid expansion, encompass￾ing a wide range of transition metals that can activate terminal alkynes, leading
to the generation of either π-complexes or metal acetylides (Scheme 5.2). These
complexes are capable of undergoing reactions with other functional groups to
facilitate the formation of new C–C bonds [15].

The same group also achieved the convenient synthesis of propargylamines via
aldehyde–alkyne–amine coupling (A3 coupling), conducted eitherin water or under
neat conditions (Scheme 5.4). This method successfully converted a diverse array of
substituted aromatic and aliphatic iminesinto theirrespective propargylamines[17].

Subsequently, Li and coworkers disclosed a highly efficient gold-catalyzed
three-component coupling of aldehyde, alkyne, and amine via C–H activation in
water[18]. This operationally simple protocol provided a variety of propargylamines
in excellent yields. Both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes and amines are viable
substrates with water as the sole byproduct (Scheme 5.5). The selection of solvent
significantly impacts the reaction outcomes. Water presented itself as a superior
solvent, enabling remarkably clean reaction pathways with nearly quantitative
yields. In contrast, the utilization of organic solvents tetrahydrofuran (THF),
toluene, and dimethylformamide (DMF) led to reduced conversions and increased
formation of byproducts. After the successful utilization of copper and gold as
catalysts, it was discovered that the silver salts, such as AgCl, AgBr, and AgI
exhibited promising catalytic activity for the three-component coupling reactions
in aqueous environments [19].

employing a Cu/pyridine-oxazoline catalyst, yielding propargylamine with remark￾able enantioselectivity (up to 84%ee in water) in water(Scheme 5.6)[20]. The imines
were generated spontaneously within the reaction mixture in most cases, and the

achieved (up to >99 : 1), catalyzed by gold (III) salen complex in water by Che’s
group when the chiral prolinol derivatives were used [21].
Later, Li and coworkers described a method for alkynylation of imines
and carbonyls in water with silver as a catalyst and phosphine as a ligand
(Scheme 5.7). Without adding phosphine ligand, the exclusive formation of the
aldehyde–alkyne–amine coupling product was achieved through C—H bond acti￾vation of terminal alkyne; conversely, the presence of a phosphine ligand resulted
in the formation of aldehyde–alkyne coupling product in water [22].

to acrolein catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2/PMe3 on water (Scheme 5.19) [35]. The experi￾mental conditions were fine-tuned to promote 1,4-addition over the acrolein poly￾merization. A variety of 4-alkynals were synthesized in moderate-to-good yields.

5.2.2 Activation of sp2 C–H Bonds
For less acidic C(sp2)–H activation, the strategies for its activation encompass a
diverse array of approaches aimed at selectively activating and functionalizing sp2
hybridized carbon-hydrogen bonds. These strategies often involve the use of tran￾sition metals, directing groups (DGs), and reaction conditions tailored to achieve
site-selective C–H bond functionalization. In 2006, Li and coworkers reported the
In(OTf)3-catalyzed addition of aromatic C-nucleophiles to 1,4-quinone derivatives
in water for the synthesis of mono- and diaryl-substituted 1,4-quinones, and water
was found to be beneficial for the transformation (Scheme 5.22) [38].
In 2010, Li and coworkers disclosed a highly efficient coupling of indole
compounds with 1,4-benzoquinones using on-water approach without using

acid via C–H bond activation in water with water-soluble diaryliodonium salts
as the aryl source (Scheme 5.31) [48]. The notable feature of this reaction is the
utilization of water-soluble aryl sources, which demonstrate excellent performance
with high-valent iodine salts of various anions. The reaction does not require
additional oxidants and thus avoids the use of expensive silver salts. Later, a
Pd-catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling reaction between acetanilides and benzylic
alcohols under aqueous conditions was reported by his group [49].

Trimethoxylphenylsilane was utilized as the phenylation reagent in this process
(Scheme 5.32) [50].
In 2015, the Rh-catalyzed homo-coupling of aryl carboxylic acids in water was
accomplished by Li’s group. This process involved dual C(sp2)–H bond activation
with MnO2 serving as the terminal oxidant (Scheme 5.33) [51]. Changing the oxi￾dant from MnO2 to NaClO2 with acetic acid as an additive, the coupling proceeded
smoothly, providing the corresponding products in good-to-excellent yields with

of an aldehyde C–H bond and aromatic C–H bond.
In 2015, a palladium-catalyzed ortho-acylation reaction with aldehydes in the
presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide as the oxidant under aqueous conditions was
demonstrated by Deng’s group. Excellent regioselectivity and wide functional group
tolerance were observed for those transformations (Scheme 5.37) [55].
In 2016, Nallasamy and coworkers described a Pd–pincer-complex-catalyzed C–H
bond activation under aerobic conditions for the synthesis of functionalized car￾bazoles in neat water (Scheme 5.38). It is worth noting that the catalytic system can
be used for up to six consecutive runs with only 0.01 mol% catalyst loading, and an
excellent yield was achieved without the column chromatography [56].5.2 C–H Bond Activation Reactions in Aqueous Medium 95

which the in situ-generated imine functions as the DG for C–H activation, followed
by cyclization in water to form various tetrahydro-β-carbolines (Scheme 5.40)
[58]. Notably, the natural products komavine 1 and spiroindolone 2 were highly
efficiently synthesized by this methodology. Additionally, this strategy can be
extended to electron-deficient aromatic systems, which would not be viable under

aromatic acids with maleimides,rendering them convertible. The reaction displayed
diverse chemoselectivity with substituted benzoic acids (Scheme 5.41). In the pro￾posed protocol, the carboxyl group acted as a crucial DG or a traceless DG, pro￾ducing two distinct products: 2-alkyl-substituted benzoic acids or alkyl-substituted
benzenes [59].

Singh’s group conducted research on ligand effect on the Ru-catalyzed C–H
bond activation for arylation reactions in the aqueous medium, in which the
2-hydroxypyridine-based ligand was observed to greatly accelerate the C–H bond
activation rate (Scheme 5.44). Mechanistic studies by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), mass spectral analysis, and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) revealed that
the ligand coordinated to Ru(II) assisted a concerted metalation-deprotonation
process [62].

5.2.3 Activation of sp3 C–H Bonds
The challenges in sp3 C–H bond activation stem from the relatively low reactivity of
aliphaticC–H bonds compared to the sp2 orspC–H bonds, as well asthe potential for
undesired side reactions and lack of selectivity. Additionally, the inherent complex￾ity and diversity of sp3-rich substrates present significant challenges in achieving
site-selective C–H activation. One strategy is to tailor transition metal catalysts to
promote sp3 C–H activation. The catalysts with appropriate ligands and coordination
environments can enhance reactivity and selectivity toward sp3 C–H bonds. In 2002,
Li’s group successfully developed a Ru-catalyzed addition reaction of aldehyde with
allyl alcohol via allylic C–H activation in water under air atmosphere (Scheme 5.45)
[63]. This method offered a convenient synthesis of β-hydroxyl ketone compounds
under mild conditions.

Another approach that was successfully developed was the sp3 C–H activa￾tion adjacent to heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen, etc. In 2007, Li’s group
accomplished the first oxidative CDC of tetrahydroisoquinoline with nitroalkanes98 5 C–H Activation Reactions in Aqueous Medium
and malonates in water, in which CuBr and molecular oxygen were used as the
catalyst and oxidant, respectively, affording the corresponding coupling prod￾ucts in high yields (Scheme 5.46) [64]. It was proposed that the reaction entails
copper-catalyzed oxidation of amines to imine-type intermediates, succeeded by a
copper-catalyzed Henry-type reaction when nitroalkanes were employed.

This approach utilizes air as the oxidizing reagent, presenting an effective method
for the synthesis of important isoxazoles derivatives. In 2018, Zhang’s group pre￾sented the CDC reaction of N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines and nitroalkanes under
visible light irradiation catalyzed by composite photocatalyst (Fe3O4-RB/LDH)
(Scheme 5.48) [66]. Notably, the coupling reaction conducted in water provided a
superior yield than in organic solvents. Then, a series of sp3 C–H coupling reactions
involving tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives and various coupling partners were
documented [67].
Introducing DG through the chelation strategy represents another effective
approach for sp3 C–H activation. In 2015, Rao and coworkers successfully devel￾oped a Pd-catalyzed hydroxylation of β-C(sp3)–H bonds in amides, in which
8-aminoquinoline was utilized as a DG in water (Scheme 5.49) [68]. It is noteworthy
that water serves as the source of oxygen, as evidenced by the isotope labeling
experiment.5.2 C–H Bond Activation Reactions in Aqueous Medium 99

in which the β-arylation of alanine was achieved by Pd-catalyzed C(sp3)–H bond

In addition to the sp3 C–H bond activation reactions catalyzed by transition met￾als, an alternative method for activating C(sp3)–H bonds involves metal-free catal￾ysis. In 2008, Li and coworkers introduced an innovative pathway for the direct
addition of cycloalkanesto imines mediated by peroxide. This method demonstrated
tolerance toward a variety of functionalities and aqueous conditions[70], as depicted

by Zhang and coworkers [73], and the initial studies also showcased that the

5.3 Summary and Conclusion
C–H activation reactions conducted in aqueous medium represent a significant
breakthrough in synthetic organic chemistry. By overcoming the challenges posed
by the polar and protic nature of water,researchers have demonstrated the feasibility
and potential advantages of performing these reactions in aqueous environments.
By leveraging strategies, such as using appropriate transition metal catalysts, DGs
with chelation, and employing water-soluble substrates and catalysts, researchers
have expanded the scope of C–H activation reactions, paving the way for greener and
more sustainable synthetic methodologies with potential applications in pharma￾ceuticals, materials science, and other fields. This chapter offers a concise overview
of the rapid progress in C–H bond activation reactions, encompassing C(sp)–H,
C(sp2)–H, and C(sp3)–H. The research on C(sp3)–H activation is comparativelyReferences 101
less extensive than that on C(sp)–H and C(sp2)–H primarily due to the inherent
challenges associated with C(sp3)–H activation. The authors of this chapter foresee
the discovery of more useful and practical C–H bond activation reactionsin aqueous
environments in the near future, especially in the field of C(sp3)–H activation.
Further research in this fascinating area holds promise to unlock new opportunities
for more efficient and environmentally friendly synthesis.

Recent Developments in Multicomponent Reactions

6.1 Introduction
MCRs represent chemical processes in which three or more starting materials
participate in a one-pot reaction, resulting in a single product which contains
all atoms of the starting materials in its final structure. The starting materials
react in a sequence of steps rather than simultaneously in one step [1]. In the
context of MCRs, it is desirable that all reactions within the MCR mixture exhibit
reversibility, while the terminal step responsible for product formation remains
irreversible (Figure 6.1). This strategic arrangement provides a driving force that
transfers all intermediates and starting materials toward the synthesis of a single
final compound [2]. In contrast to conventional multistep synthesis, MCRs provide
a synthetic method with a reduction in the number of synthetic steps, including
their workup and purification. While in multistep synthesis, the formation of
bonds proceeds stepwise, in MCRs, multiple bonds form in one operation without
isolation of intermediates or addition of further reactants [3]. As opposed to the
constraints of multistep synthesis, which primarily relies on two starting materials,
MCRs provide a more expansive way for synthesizing products with a wide range in
complexity and variety in functional groups. This versatility can be accomplished
by varying the starting materials in MCRs [4]. Altogether, MCRs hold a distinct
advantage attributable to their lower costs, shorter reaction time, higher degree of
atom economy, environmental friendliness, reduction of solvent, and reduction in
time for workup and purification processes [5]. For this reason, and the urge for
greener methods, the application of MCRs in industry has become increasingly
relevant [2, 6].
The use of solvents in chemical synthesis contributes to 80–90% of the overall
reaction mass and is an important contributor to the waste generated in synthesis
procedures [7]. Moreover, the utilization of numerous organic solvents often
involves toxicity concerns, increasing the adverse environmental impact of such
practices. Therefore, the urge to find sustainable reaction media is necessary with

water attracting considerable attention over the years [8]. From both an economic
and environmental point of view, water stands out as an advantageous solvent. It is
cheap, nontoxic, nonflammable, and readily available, rendering it an attractive
candidate for green chemistry initiatives [9]. Nevertheless, water is known for
notoriously poorly dissolving organic compounds, causing challenges in synthetic
procedures. Conversely, the physiochemical properties of water including its
polarity, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, and trans-phase interactions may
influence the reaction course [10].
The initial recognition of the advantages associated with organic transformations
conducted in aqueous environments dates back to 1980 [11]. Breslow explored a
rate enhancement when Diels–Alder reactions were performed in aqueous media
instead of organic solvents, which he attributed to the hydrophobic effect, leading
small organic compounds to form aggregates to reduce their contact surface area
with water. Water molecules will then surround these aggregates forming cavities
in the cluster structure of water. Importantly, apart from hydroxyl groups which
participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, approximately 25% of hydroxyl
groups remain uninvolved in such associations [12]. This remaining fraction can
interact with organic reactants in their transition state, thereby maximizing the
packing density of organic molecules. Consequently, this results in a reduction of
activation energies and an acceleration of reaction rates. Additionally, the high
cohesive energy density of water (550Cal cm−3) and enforced hydrophobic interac￾tions serve to further amplify reaction rates [13]. The cohesive energy density is the
energy required to eliminate an organic molecule from the bulk, thereby creating a
cavity based on the volume of the eliminated molecule. The relatively high value
for water can be attributed to the small molecular size [14]. Furthermore, organic
transformations characterized by negative reaction volumes will proceed faster in
aqueous media [15]. Notably, aside from cycloaddition reactions, MCRs feature
negative reaction volumes attributable to the condensation of multiple molecules
into a single product. Consequently, MCRs are anticipated to proceed faster in
water [16].
The utilization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes magnetic nanocomposites
(MWCNTs MNCs) has raised interest within the field of MCRs over the past two
years. This approach has been employed in various syntheses recently [17]. MNCs
are recognized for their broad catalyst support applications due to their capacity
for reusability and recoverability [18]. Unlike the conventional homogeneous6.1 Introduction 107
catalysts necessitating extensive workup and filtration procedures, MNCs can be
easily recovered using an external magnet. Due to the paramagnetic character of
the support of MNCs, the catalyst can easily be recovered and reused without the
need for a filtration step [19]. Additionally, advantages of MNCs are their high
surface area, good dispersion, and stability [18]. However, MNCs tend to easily
form large aggregates and thus lose their nanoparticle (NP) properties. To avert
aggregate formation of the MNCs, it becomes imperative to stabilize the NPs,
which can be achieved through either organic or inorganic coatings. Alternatively,
surface modification of MNCs onto MWCNTs can be pursued [17a]. MWCNTs are
known for their unique optical, electrical, and mechanical properties [20]. Their
surface area spans from 150 to 1500 m2 g−1 rendering them as good sorbents [21].
Furthermore, MWCNTs can be easily functionalized via covalent or non-covalent
strategies. Initially discovered in 1991 by Iijima, MWCNTs can be considered
as cylinder-shaped graphene sheets capped by fullerene-like structures [22].
The MWCNTs MNCs in MCRs serve as catalyst, predominantly acting as a Lewis
acid or base and are primarily employed for the synthesis of heterocycles.
The functionalization process of MWCNTs proceeds in three steps (Figure 6.2).
The first step involves the activation of MWCNTs through treatment with sulfuric
acid and nitric acid, leading to the formation of hydroxyl and carboxylic acid
functional groups on the surface of the nanotubes. The second step entails the bond
formation between, for example,Cu and the introduced hydroxyl and carboxylic acid
groups on the surface of the MWCNTs, while formaldehyde is used to reduce Cu(II)
to Cu(0). Subsequently, the chosen metals are fixed on the Cu@MWCNTs [23].

MCRs involving the use of MWCNTs MNCs are typically performed in water,
ethanol [24], or are conducted under solvent-free conditions [25].
The first MCRs conducted in water were the Ugi and Passerinireactions performed
by Pirrung and Sarma [16]. An increase in rate acceleration was observed when per￾forming the MCRsin aqueous media in lieu of traditional organic solvents. This phe￾nomenon can be attributed to the hydrophobic effect and cohesive energy density
of water. Shapiro and Vigalok reported the Passerini reaction using “in-water” and
“on-water” conditions by varying the reactants’ solubilities [26]. “In-water” reac￾tions are specified as a homogeneous mixture in water, while “on-water” reactions
are specified as a heterogeneous mixture in water [27]. Over the past two decades,
the investigation of MCRs in water has been widely explored. The first comprehen￾sive review pertaining to MCRs in water was published in 2009 by Kumaravel and
Vasuki [28]. Subsequently, two additional reviews appeared focusing on the prepa￾ration of heterocycles in water via isocyanide-based MCRs (I-MCRs), covering the
developmentsin the last two decades[8, 14].In 2022, Nazeri et al. published a review
focusing on the preparation of pseudopeptidesin water via I-MCRs[29].Javanbakht
et al. presented a comprehensive review elucidating the functionalization and modi￾fication of materials in water via MCRs [30]. In parallel, Pagadala et al. reviewed
ultrasound-assisted MCRs in water for the preparation of nitrogen, sulfur, and oxy￾gen heterocycles [31]. Lastly, in 2023, Russo et al. provided a comprehensive review
of visible light-triggered I-MCR in water [32].
This review describes the most recent advancements pertaining to I-MCRs and
Knoevenagel-initiated MCRs in water, encompassing the timeframe from 2020 to
2023. Knoevenagel-initiated MCRs utilizing isocyanides as starting material will be
covered in the I-MCR part. Furthermore, the most pivotal MCRs concerning hete￾rocyclic compounds from prior literature are described as well.
6.2 I-MCRs
The largest class of MCRs concerns the I-MCRs of which the most common
members include the Strecker, Passerini, Ugi, and Groebke–Blackburn–Bienayme
(GBB) reactions (Scheme 6.1). I-MCRs rely on an isocyanide functionality in the
starting material, a highly reactive functional group, exhibiting a unique reactivity
profile, causing them to undergo reactions with both nucleophilic and electrophilic
species at the same atom, distinguishing them from conventional functional
groups [3].
Over the past few decades, I-MCRs have garnered substantial scientific interest
due to their capacity to generate heterocyclic bioactive scaffolds [33]. Their rele￾vance is particularly notable in the pharmaceutical industry, in which they have
been extensively explored in both the production of natural products and the ratio￾nal design of drug-like compounds [14]. Consequently, an array of comprehensive
reviews about I-MCRs have been published over the years [3, 14, 29, 32, 34, 35].
Nasiriani et al. reviewed the synthesis of various types of heterocycles via
I-MCRs in aqueous medium (Scheme 6.2), some of which will be described in

6.2.1 Four-Membered Heterocycles
β-Lactam structures are used in antibiotic, antidepressant, anticancer, and antitu￾bercular agents [36]. The first synthesis of a β-lactam via an I-MCR in water was
reported by Pirrung et al., who concurrently reported the first MCR performed in
water at 50 ∘C. Their synthesis follows an Ugi four-center three-component reac￾tion (Ugi-4C-3CR), as shown in Scheme 6.3 [16]. First, the condensation between
amine 2 and aldehyde 1 yielded iminium ion 3. This reacted with isocyanide 4 to
form nitrilium ion 5, after which the carboxylate was attacked to form intermediate 6
that underwent an irreversible Mumm rearrangement to yield β-lactam 7.
Kanizsai et al. reported the synthesis of β-lactams 10a and 10b from oxanor￾bornene-based amino acid 8 in both methanol and water at room temperature,
providing similar diastereoselectivity and yieldsin water compared to methanol[37].
One year later, the same research group reported the synthesis of bi- and tricyclic
β-lactams 11, by varying β-amino acid 9 [38] (Scheme 6.4).110 6 Recent Developments in Multicomponent Reactions in Water

6.2.2 Five-Membered Heterocycles
6.2.2.1 Oxygen Heterocycles
Furan derivatives are of great importance within the field of medicinal chemistry
owing to their noteworthy biological properties, such as antibiotic, anti-infective,
antitumor, antimicrobial, and antispasmodic activity [39]. Their synthesis was
achieved via a 3-CR involving a Knoevenagel condensation, and a [1+4] cycload￾dition or a Michael addition in water at 75 ∘C (Scheme 6.5). The first step involved
a Knoevenagel condensation with cyclic 1,3-diketone 12 and aldehyde 1, yielding
Knoevenagel intermediate 13. Subsequently, intermediate 13 and isocyanide 4
reacted in a [1+4] cycloaddition or Michael addition to give intermediate 14, which
tautomerizes to tetrahydrobenzofuran 15 [40].
By varying the cyclic 1,3-diketone 12 in the 3-CR shown in Scheme 6.5, a vari￾ety of furan derivatives was obtained (Scheme 6.6). Shaabani et al. documented an6.2 I-MCRs 111

the formation of furan derivative 19 in water at 75 ∘C [41]. Furthermore, the uti￾lization of 1,3-indandione (17) in the presence of tetraethyl ammonium chloride
as catalyst under reflux conditions yielded furan derivative 20 [42]. Teimouri and
Bazhrang reported the same synthesis using 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (18) in
water at 75 ∘C to yield furanonaphthoquinone 21 [43].
Mousavi et al. reported the preparation of novel furo-[2,3-d]pyrimidines with

22 to its anhydrate form, in which it underwent a Knoevenagel condensation
with 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid (16) to form Knoevenagel intermediate 23. The
final product 24 was attained via a sequence involving a Michael addition and

The synthesis of pyrrolesthrough an I-MCR conducted in an aqueous milieu at 80 ∘C
has been documented by Pagadala et al. (Scheme 6.8) [46]. The Michael addition
with Knoevenagel intermediate 26 and isocyanide 4 yielded intermediate 27, which

primary amine 28, and isocyanide 4 to give intermediate 36. Nucleophilic attack of
the amine group to the carboxylic acid group yielded final product 37 by elimination
of water.
Kordmahalleh et al. described an aqueous 5-CR catalyzed by TiO2/Fe3O4@
MWCNTs to form spiropyrrolopyrrolizine derivatives 45 (Scheme 6.11) [49]. In this
catalytic system, Ti and Fe act as Lewis acids, while the oxygen atoms act as Lewis
base within the context of MWCNTs MNCs. The MWCNTs MNCs caused activation
of isatoic anhydride (38), which then reacted with tert-butyl isocyanide (4) to
produce intermediate 39 via a cyclization. Subsequently, the primary amine 40
reacted with the carbonyl in compound 39 to create the spirocyclic intermediate.
Activation by MWCNTs MNCs of acetylenic compound 42 led to the attack of the
previously formed intermediate to create adduct 43, which in turn reacted with
alkyl bromide 44 to create the final compound 45 upon elimination of HBr and
tert-butyl amine, followed by cyclization.
The synthesis of novel selenazolines via I-MCRs in water at 40 ∘C was described

powder (46) and isocyanide 4, yielding isoselenocyanate 47, which was in situ
reacted with 3-aminooxetane 48 to form the nucleophilic selenide 49. The desired
product 50 was then formed via an intramolecular ring-opening reaction of the
oxetane. Scheme 6.12 shows the reaction with various isocyanide moieties 4, while

produced the functionalized thiophene 59. Moghaddam et al. reported the synthesis

6.2.3.1 Oxygen Heterocycles
The synthesis of pyranderivatives via an aqueousI-MCR in the presence of BF3⋅SiO2
was reported by Akbari et al. (Scheme 6.15) [53]. First, zwitterionic intermediate
60 was formed by reacting dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate 42 with isocyanide 4.
Subsequently, the nucleophilic addition of zwitterionic intermediate 60 with dialkyl
acetone-1,3-dicarboxylate (61) resulted in the formation of intermediate 62, which
cyclized to give the functionalized pyran 63.
The same methodology has also been applied in the synthesis of pyranocoumarin
derivatives (Scheme 6.16). The use of 4-hydroxycoumarin (64) instead of dialkyl
acetone-1,3-dicarboxylate (61) resulted in the formation of pyranocoumarin 65.
Sarma et al. made use of a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC) in the 3-CR to form
pyranocoumarins 65 in water at 80 ∘C [54]. The use of the PTC was to address the
issue of the poor solubility of the starting materials in water [55].116 6 Recent Developments in Multicomponent Reactions in Water

Shaabani et al. reported the preparation of pyrazine derivatives through a 3-CR in
water at room temperature (Scheme 6.17) [56]. The first step involved the conden￾sation of diaminomaleonitrile (66) with 3-oxopentanedioic acid (67) to give imine
intermediate 68. Subsequent decarboxylation yielded the second imine intermedi￾ate 69, which upon reaction with isocyanide 4 gave intermediate 70, that in turn
cyclized to final compound 71.

this 3-CR [56].
The methodology in Scheme 6.17 was also used in the synthesis of dihydro￾quinoxalin-2-amine derivatives 77 (Scheme 6.19). Kolla and Lee reported a 3-CR

The first step, a double condensation with diaminomaleonitrile (66) and ketone 84,
resulted in diimine intermediate 85. Subsequently, an imine-enamine cyclization
of this intermediate gave rise to intermediate 86, which by nucleophilic attack of
isocyanide 4 provided the nitrilium intermediate 87. Nucleophilic attack of water
finally resulted in the formation of diazepine 88.

Scheme 6.21 Preparation of diazepine derivatives using a 4-CR in water.
Pyrimidobenzazepines have been synthesized via a green and efficient 7-CR
in water at room temperature, catalyzed by Ag/Fe3O4/TiO2/CuO@MWCNTs
(Scheme 6.22) [61]. Benzazepine derivatives are well known for their widespread
biological activities [61]; therefore, the development of green synthesis methods
is of substantial value. The synthesis commenced with alkylation of isoquinoline
(80) with alkyl bromide 44 to form iminium ion 89. Subsequently, 2-amino benzoic
acid 90 reacted with diethyl carbonate (91), both of which were activated by the
catalyst, creating isatoic anhydride 92. The iminium ion 85 and isatoic anhydride
92 then reacted to form intermediate 93, which in the presence of acetylenic
compound 94 and ammonium acetate (79) led to intermediate 95. In the final
step, intermediate 95 and tert-butyl isocyanide (4) further cyclized to form the
pyrimidobenzazepines 96.
The synthesis of oxazolopyrimidoazepines in the presence of Ag/Fe3O4/TiO2/
CuO@MWCNTs in water at room temperature was described by Avarsaji et al.
(Scheme 6.23). It is worth noting the role of Ag in the synthesis acting as a strong
Lewis acid [62]. The first steps in the 6-CR were similar to those depicted in6.3 Knoevenagel-Initiated MCRs 119

a Michael addition/cyclization or a cycloaddition, leading to complexity and
heterocycle formation (Scheme 6.24). On the one hand, the Knoevenagel product is
an electron-deficient alkene which is a good Michael acceptor [63], but, on the other
hand, when the Knoevenagel condensation involves a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound,
a 1,3-heterodiene species is formed, poised for participation in a Diels–Alder
reaction. Owing to the diversity in aldehydes, the resulting Knoevenagel product
can exhibit a high degree of chemical functionality. Knoevenagel-initiated MCRs
are well conducted in aqueous media and therefore widely used in MCRs in water
[64]. Consequently, various reviews dedicated to Knoevenagel-initiated MCRs have
emerged in recent years [63, 65], including a chapter about Knoevenagel-initiated
MCRs in water by Gu [33].
6.3.1 Five-Membered Heterocycles
6.3.1.1 Oxygen Heterocycles
The preparation of trans-2,3-dihydrofurans via a Knoevenagel-initiated MCR
in water at room temperature was described by Bantitaba (Scheme 6.25). Their
protocol made use of ultrasound irradiation and SiO2 NPs as a catalyst to shorten
the reaction time and enhance the yield of the final product [66]. Their synthesis
started with the formation of pyridinium ylide 100 through a substitution reaction
employing pyridine and alkyl bromide 44. Knoevenagel intermediate 101 reacted
with 4-hydroxycoumarin (64), forming a zwitterionic intermediate, which via
annulation and by loss of pyridine yielded product 102.
6.3.1.2 Nitrogen Heterocycles
The synthesis of pyrazole derivatives via a Knoevenagel-initiated MCR was

6.3.1.3 Nitrogen and Oxygen Heterocycles
Novel isoxazole derivatives were synthesized via a 3-CR in water at room
temperature using ultrasound irradiation (Scheme 6.27), as described by Daroughe￾hzadeh and Kiyani. The nucleophilic addition of hydroxylamine 106 to the
carbonyl of ketoester 107 resulted in oxime intermediate 108. Subsequently,
triphenylphosphine-activated aldehyde 109 and oxime 108 reacted in a Knoeve￾nagel condensation to yield intermediate 110. Finally, product 111 was generated
via cyclization and elimination of ethanol [68].
A mechanistically identical approach was adapted in Scheme 6.28. Zhang et al.
reported a comparable synthetic pathway (Scheme 6.28) using vitamin B1 as a
catalyst [69]. Reddy and Reddy reported a synthetic protocol using ultrasonic122 6 Recent Developments in Multicomponent Reactions in Water

6.3.2 Six-Membered Heterocycles
6.3.2.1 Oxygen Heterocycles
Aldehyde 1 and malonontrile (25) represent the primary precursors for the syn￾thesis of fused pyranopyrimidines, tetrahydrobenzopyrans, and chromenes. These
compounds were prepared via a tandem Knoevenagel/Michael addition/cyclization
one-potreaction, with water-compatible Michael donors,such as 16, 64, 12, 116, 118,
or 120 resulting in libraries of different heterocycles upon cyclization (Scheme 6.29).
The synthesis of pyranopyrimidines 113 was described by Kondabanthini et al.
(Scheme 6.30). Their protocol made use of ultrasonic irradiation in water at 30 ∘C
together with sulfonic acid-functionalized Wang resin, which served as a polymeric
and recoverable catalyst [72]. Alternatively, novel chitosan-ZnO (CS-ZnO) was used6.3 Knoevenagel-Initiated MCRs 123

Shaikh et al. reported an ultrasound-assisted synthetic protocol for the prepa￾ration of pyrano[3,2-c]chromene derivatives in the presence of Mn2O3 MNPs as
a catalyst in a mixture of ethanol and water (2 : 1) (Scheme 6.31). The authors
aimed to develop a green method to derive 2-amino-4H-chromene as conventional
synthetic procedures made use of harmful organic solvents, long reaction times,
and low yields [74]. Furthermore, Sheikhhosseini and Yahyazadehfar reported the
synthesis of chromene compounds 114 employing a Fe-hydroxyquinoline@Fe3O4
catalyst under reflux conditions. Hereby, the hydroxyquinoline was used to prepare
a metal–organic framework (MOF) together with Fe to modify and protect the NPs
of Fe3O4 [75]. Rahimzadeh et al. synthesized similar compounds in the presence
of NPs composed of dysprosium and balsalazide trapped between functional￾ized graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) and halloysite (Dy@Hal-SS-g-C3N4) as
a heterogeneous catalyst under reflux conditions [76]. The catalyst was used for
activation of the carbonyl group in aromatic aldehyde 1 and the nitrile in 25.
Analogously, Fabitha et al. described an approach using a base-catalyzed Knoeve￾nagel/Michael addition/cyclization mechanism, employing sodium fluoride as the
catalyst. The application of MWI shortened the reaction time and led to higher
yields [77].6.3 Knoevenagel-Initiated MCRs 125

Scheme 6.32 Preparation of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran derivatives via a 3-CR in water.
Rahimzadeh et al. made use of a 3-CR to generate tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran
derivatives 115 in the presence of Dy@Hal-SS-g-C3N4 as heterogeneous catalyst
underreflux conditions(Scheme 6.32)[76]. The utilization ofsodium dodecylsulfate
(SDS) as catalyst in the synthesis to form compound 115 was described by Banerjee
et al. SDS served as a metal-free surfactant-type catalyst for the Knoevenagel/
Michael addition/cyclization mechanism [78]. Furthermore, preparation of
2-amino-4H-benzo[b]pyran 115 was also described in the presence of 3-glycidoxy￾propyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS)/guanidine-protected MNPs as catalyst. The het￾erogeneous nanocatalyst was prepared by conjugating GPTMS-guanidine to MNPs,
thereby facilitating the activation of the carbonyl in 1 and nitrile groups in 25 [79].
Khumalo et al. described an aqueous microwave-assisted synthesis to form tetrahy￾drobenzo[b]pyran derivatives 115 [80]. The previously described CS-ZnO catalyst
in combination with MWI at 100 ∘C was also used in the synthesis of compounds
115, again resulting in shorter reaction times and improved yields [72]. The novel
green synthesis of coumarin derivatives using a matrix composed of L-glutamic
acid cross-linked-chitosan supported on MWCNTs with Ni(II) was reported
by Galehban et al. This synthetic procedure follows the Knoevenagel/Michael
addition/Thorpe–Ziegler cyclization sequence [25b].

The synthesis of spiropyrans through a 3-CR in the presence of SDS in water at
room temperature was described by Banerjee et al. (Scheme 6.40) [78]. The use of
either ninhydrin (140) or isatin (125) as starting material resulted in the synthesis of

D-glucose, possesses hydroxyl functional groups that enhance the surface activity
and stability of NPs [85]. The first step was the condensation between ethyl acetoac￾etate (143) and diamine 144 to form imine intermediate 145. Subsequently, enolate
146 was generated through elimination of ethanol. The following steps involved the

between the chromene moiety of the Knoevenagel intermediate and in situ￾generated ammonia, to form an intermediate which upon cyclization formed prod￾uct 151. Comparison was made between the conventional reflux-based synthesis
procedure and the microwave-assisted protocol. Notably, the microwave-assisted
synthesis demonstrated advantages by affording higher yields of the final products
while achieving remarkably short reaction times of only a few minutes [87].

Knoevenagel/Michael addition/cyclization approach, this time, in the presence of

of the amine group in 6-amino-1,3-dimethyluracil (154) resulted in the formation
of pyrimidine 156, while the use of barbituric acid (16) led to the formation of the

ultrasonic irradiation, resulting in shorter reaction times and higher yields [90].
The microwave-assisted synthesis of thiadiazoloquinazolinone-coumarin hybrids
160 in water at 120 ∘C was reported by Wadhwa et al. (Scheme 6.46). This synthetic
approach followed the same Knoevenagel/Michael addition/cyclization mecha￾nism in the presence of Bi(NO3)3⋅ 5 H2O, which under the reaction conditions
decomposed into nitric acid and Bi(OH)3 [91]. Both resulting species were thought
to actively facilitate the mechanistic progression.
The preparation of 1,4-dihydropyridines 163 followed the same Knoevenagel/
Michael addition/cyclization strategy as described before. Khumalo et al. reported a
synthetic protocol using MWI and triethylamine (NEt3) as a catalyst in an aqueous
medium (Scheme 6.47) [92]. Intermediate 162 was generated via a Michael addition,
while subsequent condensation of the alcohol with ammonium acetate (79) yielded
an amine, which in turn cyclized into compound 163 through the elimination of
water.
Functionalized 1,4-dihydropyridines 167 were synthesized through a catalyst-free
and microwave-assisted 4-CR in water at room temperature (Scheme 6.48) [93].
Following the tandem Knoevenagel/Michael addition/cyclization reaction, 1,4-

by elimination of acetone and carbon dioxide. Primary amine 28 and intermediate
174 reacted to form amide 175. The final step involved a Knoevenagel condensation
and cyclization of malononitrile (25) and amide 175 in the presence of the catalyst,
affording spiropyridoindolepyrrolidines 176 [95].
The synthesis ofspiropyridoindoles using MWCNTsin water atroom temperature
was investigated by Tabarsaei et al. (Scheme 6.51). Ag exhibited the most potent
catalytic effect as a Lewis acid compared to Cd and Fe [96]. The first steps led to

the formation of intermediate 178 following a similar procedure as depicted in
Scheme 6.50. Subsequently, intermediate 178 reacted with isothiocyanate 179 and
cyclized in the presence of the catalyst yielding spiropyridoindole 180.
Spiro-1,2,4-triazine derivatives have been synthesized via a 6-CR in the presence
of NEt3 and Ag/Fe3O4/CdO@MWCNTs as catalyst in water at room temperature
(Scheme 6.52) [97]. Acetophenone 181 and diethyl oxalate (182) reacted in the
presence of Ag/Fe3O4/CdO@MWCNTs to give 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds 183.
Subsequently, ammonium acetate (79) reacted with intermediate 183 to form enam￾ine 184. Knoevenagel intermediate 185 underwent cyclization with this enamine to
yield spirocycle intermediate 186, which reacted further with hydrazonoyl chloride
187 and cyclized to form spiro-1,2,4-triazine 188. Alternative spiro-1,2,4-triazines
189 and 190 were synthesized following the same strategy, but using other starting
materials, replacing compound 140 with either isatin (125) or acenaphthylene￾1,2-dione [97].
6.4 Summary and Conclusions
In the past decades, the incorporation of MCRs in the synthesis of heterocyclic
scaffolds has attracted increasing attention. MCRs, characterized by their ability
to combine three or more available starting materials in one-pot, have, in many
instances, proven to be a more efficient approach for the synthesis of particular
heterocycles than their conventional multistep synthetic alternatives. The use
of MCRs in the field of organic synthesis has contributed to reduced time, man￾power, and the use of chemicals, leading to a reduction in the E-factor and mass
intensity, key considerations within the principles of green chemistry. An additional
important aspect is the use of green solvents in organic synthesis which has also
contributed significantly to the use of water in MCRs. Beyond adhering to the aims
of green chemistry, performing MCRs in water has the benefit that it facilitates
accelerating the reaction rate and reduces workup and purification steps as in many
instances, a simple filtration step was sufficient to obtain the final product. With the
use of water also, a strongly increased application of MWCNTs MNCs is witnessed
in I-MCRs and Knoevenagel-initiated MCRs. Considering the need for developing
greener synthesis methods and the continuing relevance of heterocycles in the
search for new drugs, it is highly anticipated that new synthetic methods employing
MCRs in water will continue to appear from future research.

Pericyclic Reactions in Aqueous Medium

7.1 Introduction
7.1.1 Pericyclic Reactions
Pericyclic reactions are a special class of organic reactions that involve a concerted,
cyclic transition state. In other words, the bond breaking and making happen simul￾taneously in a cyclic manner (but not necessarily synchronously) and do not involve
any distinct intermediates [1]. The term “pericyclic”, introduced by Woodward and
Hoffmann in 1969, originated from the word “peri”, meaning around and indicat￾ing the cyclic movement of the electrons (i.e. bonds) during these processes [2].
Pericyclic reactions can be either unimolecular or bimolecular in nature and are
categorized into four major classes [3],such as cycloaddition reactions, electrocyclic
reactions, sigmatropic rearrangements, and group transfer reactions [4].
7.1.1.1 Cycloaddition Reactions
Cycloaddition reaction is an addition reaction between two π-reactants resulting
in the formation of a cyclic adduct (i.e. addition product) via the construction of
two new σ-bonds at the expense of two π-bonds (Scheme 7.1a). These are bimolec￾ular (intermolecular) reactions in general, for example, the Diels–Alder (D–A)
reaction, but many unimolecular (intramolecular) reactions are also well known.
Cycloaddition reactions can also show reversibility, depending on the nature of
the substrates and reaction conditions, and these are called retro-cycloaddition
reactions. The retro-cycloaddition is a unimolecular process and typically involves
the loss of two σ-bonds and the creation of two new π-bonds.
7.1.1.2 Electrocyclic Reactions
Electrocyclic reactions are unimolecular in nature and include both ring-forming
and ring-opening processes. An electrocyclic ring closure reaction represents a
ring-forming process where a new σ-bond is established between the two ends of a
conjugated π-system, resulting in a cyclic system with shorter π-bonds. Conversely,

in the ring opening, a σ-bond of a cyclic system is broken, leading to a longer
conjugated π-system (Scheme 7.1b).
7.1.1.3 Sigmatropic Rearrangements
Sigmatropic rearrangement involves an intramolecular migration of a σ-bond
(located adjacent to one or two π-components), leading to the simultaneous
reorganization of the π-system(s) (Scheme 7.1c). This process proceeds through the
breaking of an existing σ-bond and the formation of a new one. Given its reversible
nature, the preferred direction of the rearrangement is dictated by thermodynamics.
These sigmatropic rearrangements are inherently unimolecular.
7.1.1.4 Group Transfer Reactions
These are a class of pericyclic reactions in which one or two groups are transferred
from one molecule to another (Scheme 7.1d). This process involves the breaking
and making of σ-bonds, accompanied by modifications in the associated π-systems.
These reactions are bimolecular. Only a few chemical reactions are classified under
this category, such as the ene reaction and diimide reduction.
Pericyclic reactions are very important in organic synthesis and have been
widely used to construct complex molecular frameworks in a stereochemically
controlled manner. The concept of molecular orbital (MO) theory is very important
to understand pericyclic reactions. Understanding the energetics and symmetries
of the MOs of reacting units is crucial for predicting the outcome of any of the
pericyclic reactions. There are three well-known mechanistic approaches for
analyzing pericyclic reactions:
(i) Orbital symmetry correlation approach, developed by Woodward and
Hoffmann [5], as well as by Longuet-Higgins and Abrahamson [6].
(ii) Transition state aromaticity approach, developed independently by Zimmer￾man [7] and Dewar [8].
(iii) Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) approach, developed first by Woodward and
Hoffmann [5b] and then by Fukui [9].7.2 Cycloaddition Reactions in Aqueous Medium 143
7.1.2 Water in Organic Synthesis
Water has been called the universal solvent. However, the utilization of water as
a reaction medium for organic reactions has only gained significant attention in
recent few decades within the field of organic synthesis. This delayed interest can
be attributed to the prevalent belief that substances do not interact unless dissolved,
and like needs (dissolves). In this context, several articles, books, and reviews have
already been published on the importance of water in organic reactions [10–12].
In recent times, the usage of water as a reaction medium for organic synthesis has
become a vital point due to several compelling reasons. Water stands out as the
most abundant liquid on the planet and possesses characteristics such as being cost￾effective, readily available, nontoxic, and nonflammable. In nearly all investigated
cases, a marked enhancement in reaction rates has been observed. Over the past few
decades, pericyclic reactions have been extensively investigated under various condi￾tions and solvents, including water.In this chapter, we have limited our discussion to
different types of pericyclic reactions, which employed water asthe reaction medium
and described the effect of water on the reaction rates,regio- and stereochemical out￾comes of this unique class of organic reactions. Since there is a lot of development
on the chemistry of cycloaddition reactions “in-water” and “on-water”, we have pre￾sented our discussion in the order of cycloaddition reactions, electrocyclic reactions,
sigmatropic rearrangements, and group transfer reactions.
7.2 Cycloaddition Reactions in Aqueous Medium
In the literature, varioustypes of cycloaddition reactionssuch as[4+2], [3+2] [4+3],
[2+2], [2+2+2], and [5+2] are precedent. These reactions differ in the nature of the
reacting unitsinvolved, particularly the number of atomsinvolved in a cycloaddition
reaction from each of the reactants. Most of them have been studied in the aqueous
medium.
7.2.1 The In-Water [4+2] Cycloaddition Reactions (or) Diels–Alder
Reactions
The [4π+2π] cycloaddition reaction, also known asthe classical D–A reaction, is one
of the most extensively studied organic reactions. This involves the interaction of a
diene (possessing 4π electrons over 4-atoms) with a dienophile (possessing 2π elec￾trons over 2-atoms), leading to the formation of a six-membered ring through the
simultaneous construction of two new carbon–carbon σ-bonds. It was discovered in
1928 by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder, when they successfully demonstrated the reaction
between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride, resulting in the formation of the
bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative [13]. Their pioneering work was recognized with
the Nobel Prize in 1950 (Scheme 7.2a). The D–A reaction holds a significant syn￾thetic importance as it allows the controlled synthesis of six-membered rings with
precise regio- and stereocontrol [14].144 7 Pericyclic Reactions in Aqueous Medium

The D–A reaction was also one of the first organic reactions to be performed
in water by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder themselves in 1931 [15]. This accidental
discovery was observed when they refluxed a mixture of furan and maleic acid
in water. However, the significance of the reaction was unrecognized at the time
since water was not a commonly used solvent. Later in 1948, Woodward and Baer
[16], observed a substantial change in the selectivity of endo-/exo-products when
the reaction was employed in water, as compared to traditional organic solvents
(Scheme 7.2b). In 1973, Huisman and coworkers [17] performed the same D–A
reaction between furan and maleic acid in various solvents, including H2O, D2O
(55%), CD3OD (33%), and DMSO-d6 (10%), at room temperature for five days and
observed similar endo-/exo-product ratios (2.2 : 1) in all the solvents. Surprisingly,
until the rediscovery by Breslow in 1980, no efforts were made on this reaction to
understand the effect of water.
Breslow and coworkers performed a comprehensive study on the D–A reactions
to understand the impact of water on both reaction rates and endo-/exo-product
selectivity [18]. Varying reaction rates, yields, and the degree of selectivity were
evidently observed for D–A reactions conducted in solvents of different natures. The
factors influencing the magnitude of reaction rate and selectivity in these reactions
were attributed to solvophobic effects, interactions involving hydrogen bond donors
(HBD), and dipolarity–polarizability. Accordingly, the enhanced reaction rates
observed in aqueous reaction media were explained by the high solvophobic power
(Sp) of aqueous media. Conversely, in fluorinated alcohols, the increase in reaction
rate was attributed to the HBD ability. Solvent solvophobicity has been invoked
in some media to elucidate the heightened endo/exo selectivity, while HBD power
appeared to be the sole factor influencing regioselectivity in certain cases.

cyclopentadiene and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) in three differentsolvents, Rideout7.2 Cycloaddition Reactions in Aqueous Medium 145

and Breslow noted a gradual increase in the reaction rate from isooctane (k =6 ×
105 M−1 s−1) to methanol (k =76 × 105 M−1 s−1). However, in the case of water
(k =4400 × 105 M−1 s−1), there was a remarkable jump in the rate of the cycload￾dition reaction (entries 1–3, Table 7.1a). Similarly, an enhanced reaction rate was
also observed during the D–A reaction between cyclopentadiene and acrylonitrile
in water, i.e. 31 times higher than that in isooctane (entry 6 vs. entry 8, Table 7.1b).
This work was marked as a significant milestone in the history of organic chemistry.
They speculated that the observed rate enhancement may not only be solely
attributable to solvent polarity but also involve another factor. This is evident as the
reaction rate trend did not align with the polarity trend (MeOH > water>isooctane;
polarity). Subsequent experiments (entries 1–3, Table 7.1c) involving the cycload￾dition reaction between 9-hydroxymethylanthracene 1 and N-ethylmaleimide 2
provided strong support for the proposed hidden factor, as a drop-in reaction rate
was observed from isooctane to methanol, while a significant enhancement was
observed in water. This observation led Breslow to propose the hydrophobic effect
of water as the unrevealed rate-enhancing factor.
To support this phenomenon, Breslow conducted additional control experiments
by introducing pro-hydrophobic and anti-hydrophobic agents in 1991 [19]. The
incorporation of LiCl (pro-hydrophobic agent, 4.86 M aqueous solution) into
the reaction medium involving cyclopentadiene and MVK led to a 2.5-fold increase
in the reaction rate (entry 4, Table 7.1a) compared to the normal water condition
(entry 3, Table 7.1a). This effect resembles a “salts-out” phenomenon, where
external salts enhance the hydrophobicity of the reaction medium. Conversely,
a threefold decrease in reaction rate was observed with the addition of a 4.86 M
aqueous solution of guanidinium chloride (an anti-hydrophobic agent) (entry 5,146 7 Pericyclic Reactions in Aqueous Medium
Table 7.1a). Thisreduction in rate is associated with a decrease in the hydrophobicity
of the medium due to the large guanidinium ion, resembling a “salts-in” effect.
Subsequently, numerous research groups have independently determined the
second-order rate constants for D–A reactions involving various dienes and
dienophiles [20]. In most cases, they observed significant rate accelerations in
aqueous media compared to the routinely used organic solvents.
Following the study of Rideout and Breslow on the rate enhancement of
cycloaddition reactions in water, it became evident that rate accelerations were
achievable in a wide range of bimolecular and intramolecular organic reactions
(in-water, where the reactants are soluble in the aqueous medium). However, the
challenge of substrate solubilities in water persisted, posing difficulties for practical
synthetic applications of this observation. Various strategies were explored to
address this issue, including the utilization of binary aqueous solvent mixtures.
Additionally, innovative approaches were also explored, such as the incorporation
of a pro-hydrophobic functional group into either of the substrates, i.e. diene or
dienophile. For example, in 1983, Grieco et al. [21] reported an intermolecular
D–A reaction between sodium (E)-3,5-hexadienoate 3 and methyl (acetoxymethyl)
acrylate 4 in water. After 24 hours, an endo-selective (endo:exo; 2 : 1) product
mixture 5a/b was obtained with a 67% overall yield at 60 ∘C (entry 1, Scheme 7.3).
In contrast, the corresponding reaction (without structural modification) with ester
6 took 96 hoursin refluxing toluene (entry 2), resulting in an exo-selective (endo:exo;
1 : 2) product mixture 5a/b.

Scheme 7.3 Enhanced reaction rates in water for an intermolecular Diels–Alder reaction.
Another such example was reported in 2002 by Yoshida and coworkers [22],
where they performed a D–A reaction between 2-PyMe2Si-substituted 1,3-diene 7
(2-PyMe2Si=2-pyridyldimethylsilyl; the pyridyl group initially forms a pyridinium
salt with the added HCl to increase the solubility of the substrate 7, in water) with
p-benzoquinone 8, in water at room temperature (entries 1 and 2, Scheme 7.4).
The same reaction in organic solvents (Et2O/toluene) found to be very slow and
less efficient, indicating the dramatic rate acceleration in water (Scheme 7.4).
Later, many reports have appeared in the literature based on this approach [23].
Additional notable characteristics observed in aqueous D–A reactions include the
beneficial impact of water-tolerant Lewis acids when employed as catalysts [24]
and the utilization of surfactants to create micellar environments [25].7.2 Cycloaddition Reactions in Aqueous Medium 147

Scheme 7.4 D–A reaction of 2-PyMe2Si-substituted 1,3-dienes with p-benzoquinone in
water.
In addition to Breslow’s hydrophobic effect, several research groups have
suggested a new factor, i.e. hydrogen bonding by the solvent, for the water-mediated
rate enhancement in D–A reactions [26]. Engbert’s group in 1992 studied the Gibbs
free energy of activation for the D–A reaction between cyclopentadiene and MVK
in water and several other organic solvents. They observed that the reaction rates
were higher in water compared to othersolvents. They attributed these observations
to the combined influence of the hydrophobic effect of water on reactants and the
hydrogen bonding effect of water with the transition state [27].
Subsequently, the same group explored the role of hydrogen bonding in D–A
reactions in-water by employing two different dienophiles [28], namely, MVK
and methyl vinyl sulfone (MVS), which differ in their hydrogen bonding abilities.
Generally, sulfones are weaker hydrogen-bond acceptors and relatively poor car￾banion stabilizers on the α-carbon than their ketone counterparts, and the reaction
rates are expected to align with this trend (rate CO >SO2). As expected, the [4+2]
cycloaddition reaction rate of MVS in water was four times slower than that of
MVK (compare entry 1 of Table 7.2ab). Furthermore, they conducted the reactions
in a series of HBD organic solvents, such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol
(HFIP), 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), 1-propanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile for
both substrates and compared their reaction rates with those of in-water reactions
(Table 7.2a,b, entries 1–6). The increase in Gibbs energy of activation and rate
retardation was observed from water to HFIP to TFE to 1-propanol to ethanol
to acetonitrile. These observations strongly support the role of hydrogen-bond
interactions with the transition states in accelerating the reaction rate during
the D–A reactions in-water. Although HFIP and TFE are stronger HBDs than
water, the observed reaction rates are lower than in water. This discrepancy is
explained by the fact that the Gibbs energies calculated for the reactions in-water
account for both hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding effects, whereas for HFIP
and TFE, it only considers the hydrogen-bonding effect without the hydrophobic
effect.148 7 Pericyclic Reactions in Aqueous Medium

Similarly, several research groups have also performed systematic studies on
various D–A reactions (using different dienes and dienophiles) to support the
concept of hydrogen bonding-enhanced reaction rates [29, 30].
7.2.2 Effect of Water on Endo-/Exo-Selectivity in [4+2] Cycloaddition
Reactions
One of the very crucial factors in [4+2] cycloaddition reactions is the endo-/exo￾stereoselectivity, which can arise when substituted dienes and dienophiles
are employed. Under ordinary circumstances, the kinetic product, specifically
the endo-isomer, tends to be favored over its thermodynamic counterpart, the
exo-isomer. However, in a few instances, the exo-isomer has been identified as the
predominant product. This distribution of products can be effectively elucidated
by examining the energy levels of their respective transition states. It is proposed
by Woodward and Katz that, the involvement of secondary orbital interactions,
particularly in dienophiles with an additional π-electron density in conjugation,
contributesto the understanding of thisselectivity [31]. In addition,severalresearch
groups have proven (experimentally as well as theoretically) that the polarities of
the solvents play an important role on the endo- vs. exo-selectivity in D–A reactions.
They observed an increased preference for the endo-product, which was attributed
to the higher polarity of its transition state compared to the exo-transition state
[32–36]. However, when focusing exclusively on aqueous solvent mixtures for D–A
reactions, the presence of water (acting as a polar solvent) in D–A reactions, favors
endo-product over exo-product.
Breslow’s research group [37] has also observed a similar trend of endo-/exo￾product distribution when they performed the D–A reaction between cyclopenta￾diene and MVK in diverse solvents, including water, which differ in their polarity.
They observed an increment in endo-/exo-ratio as well as the rate of reactions in7.2 Cycloaddition Reactions in Aqueous Medium 149
aqueous medium as compared to organic solvents (Scheme 7.5). It was observed
that when water was employed as a solvent, the endo-/exo-ratio went up to (21.4, 1)
in comparison to organic solvents. Later, they also observed further enhancement
of the endo-product selectivity in the presence of the pro-hydrophobic additive LiCl
(salt-in effect) and a decrease in endo-selectivity when the anti-hydrophobic agent
guanidinium chloride (GnCl) (salt-out effect) was added to the reaction medium
(Scheme 7.5).

7.2.3 Intramolecular Diels–Alder Reactions In-Water
In comparison to the bimolecular [4+2] cycloaddition reactions, the intramolecular
D–A reactions are less explored in water. In 1995, the research group of Engberts
[38] reported probably the first intramolecular D–A reactions in-water by employ￾ing the N-furfuryl-N-alkylacrylamides 9 and 10 (Scheme 7.6). Here, water was
identified as a promoter to enhance the rate of the reactions. At 25 ∘C, the rate
constants for compound 9 (R1 =CO2H) were measured as kDCM =2.36 × 10−5 s−1
and kwater =2.50 × 10−2 s−1, reflecting a remarkable enhancement of 1064 times in
water (entries 1–4). In contrast, for the compound 10 (R1 = H), the reaction in EtOH
was unsuccessful even after three weeks at 60 ∘C (entry 5). However, the reaction
was successful in water at 60 ∘C, exhibiting a rate constant of kwater =2.05 × 10−5 s−1
(entry 6).

Later, several reports have appeared in the literature based on the intramolecular

In addition to the bimolecular as well as intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition reac￾tions, several other variants [40], like inverse electron demand D–A reactions [41],
asymmetric D–A reactions [42], retro-D–A reactions [43], were also studied in water
medium by various research groups.
7.2.4 On-Water [4+2] Cycloaddition Reactions
In 2005, Sharpless introduced the term “on-water” reactions to describe hetero￾geneous reactions where one or both reactants are not soluble in water [44]. The
“on-water” method involves simply stirring the insoluble reactant(s) with water
to create an aqueous suspension. Sharpless conducted pericyclic reactions in
aqueous suspension (on-water) and observed significantly enhanced kinetics and
yields in most cases when compared to those in organic solvents. For example,
the cycloaddition reaction between trans, trans-2,4-hexadienyl acetate 11 and
N-propylmaleimide 12 gives the cycloadduct 13 (Scheme 7.7a). Notably, the protic
organic solvent MeOH outperformed aprotic solvents like toluene, CH3CN, as

Scheme 7.7 “On-water” Diels–Alder reaction.
Another such “on-water” D–A reaction was reported in 2001 (Scheme 7.7b),
by the research group of Graham, where the reaction between the benzotriazole
maleimide 14 (BTM) against seven diene partners 15 was performed in aqueous
acetonitrile [45].
7.3 Miscellaneous Cycloaddition Reactions In-Water
In addition to the extensive studies on the [4+2] cycloaddition reactions in-water,
a few examples of other types of cycloaddition reactions such as [3+2], [4+3], [2+2],
[2+2+2], and [5+2] have also been reported in the aqueous medium.
7.3.1 The [3+2] or 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions
This category of pericyclic reactions holds significant synthetic value in organic
synthesis for the construction of five-membered heterocycles like 1,2,3-triazoles7.3 Miscellaneous Cycloaddition Reactions In-Water 151
[46], tetrazoles [47], pyrazoles [48], pyrazolines [49], isoxazoles [50], isoxazolidines
[51], pyrroles, and pyrrolidines [52]. Over the past few decades, in-water 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition reactions have gained recognition as a valuable and unconventional
synthetic method.
The role of water in [3+2] cycloaddition reactions was investigated by Engberts
and coworkers in 1995 [46d]. The kinetic study of the reaction between norbornene
and phenyl azide giving triazoles 16 was performed in organic solvents as well as
aqueous medium. A rate enhancement from 7.4 to 37 was observed by changing the
solvent from pure ethanol to (75 : 25) H2O: EtOH mixture (entries 1–3). A substantial
acceleration to 83 was observed with the (92 : 8) H2O: EtOH solvent mixture. Exper￾imentally recorded kinetic data clearly indicated that the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
reactions experience significantrate acceleration in solutions with higher water con￾tent (Scheme 7.8).

Scheme 7.9 The water-mediated, 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions of (a) 5-azidovalerate
with alkynes and (b) phenyl azide derivatives with methyl propiolate.
Molteni and Ponti [54] conducted various 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions in aqueous
medium using p-substituted phenyl azide derivatives 20 against methyl propiolate
21 (Scheme 7.9b). Tetrahexylammonium chloride (THAC) was served as a phase
transfer catalyst, and the reactions were carried out at 90 ∘C. The reaction times152 7 Pericyclic Reactions in Aqueous Medium
varied with the substituent: 60 minutes (R= H), 40 minutes (R= Me), 30 minutes
(R= MeO), 120 minutes (R=F), and 300 minutes (R= NO2), and they were notably
shorter than the uncatalyzed reactions reported by Wang and Qin [46b]. The iso￾lated yields of the triazoles 22 were more than 92% and found to be independent of
the nature of the substituent. Later, in the subsequent years, many in-water [3+2]
cycloaddition reactions were reported in the literature [55].
7.3.2 [2+2+2] Cycloaddition Reactions
The [2+2+2] cycloaddition represents a sophisticated, atom-efficient, and
group-tolerant method for synthesizing aromatics and heteroaromatic systems.
Despite the extensive exploration of the [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction in recent
decades, there are relatively few instances where water has been employed as a
solvent [56]. In 2000, Eaton and coworker reported a water-soluble cobalt complex
23 catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction [57]. This process involves two alkyne
units and a nitrile in a mixture of water and methanol (7 : 3) at 85 ∘C, to give a
chemospecific synthesis of functionalized pyridines in good yields (Scheme 7.10a).

A highly efficient [2+2+2] cycloaddition-based approach forthe synthesis of func￾tionalized pyridines 24 from diynes 25 and nitriles 26 in aqueous medium was also
demonstrated (Scheme 7.10b) in 2012 by the research group of Wan. This method
utilizes Cp*Ru(COD)Cl/tppts as the catalyst [58].
7.3.3 [4+3] Cycloaddition Reactions
The [4+3] cycloaddition reactions, involving allylic (oxyallyl) cations and dienes
(like furan or cyclopentadiene), represent an important approach for the direct
construction of seven-membered rings, both in inter- and intramolecular manners.7.3 Miscellaneous Cycloaddition Reactions In-Water 153

Scheme 7.11 [4+3] Cycloaddition reactions in water.
However, examples of [4+3] cycloaddition reactions in-water are very scarce in the
literature (Scheme 7.11). A water-promoted [4+3] cycloaddition reaction involving
an in situ generated oxyallyl cation 27 and furan, leading to the formation of the
oxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octenone skeleton 28, was disclosed by Lubinea and Bouchain
in 1997 [59]. This pioneering work was marked as the first instance of [4+3]
cycloaddition utilizing water as the solvent. The process resulted in excellent yields
(60–88%) and favorable endo-selectivity at room temperature. However, conducting
the same reaction in any organic solvent gave very poor yields (<30%) for the
products and highlighted the rate-enhancing effect of water as observed in [4+2]
cycloaddition reactions.
7.3.4 [5+2] Cycloaddition Reactions
In 2003, the research group of Wender [60] reported a novel water-soluble rhodium
catalyst for an intramolecular [5+2] cycloaddition of vinylcyclopropanes and
alkynesin-water for the construction of fused seven-membered rings(Scheme 7.12).
This method was further extended to intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition reactions
of dienes and alkenes in-water.

Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions represent a highly effective method for
synthesizing four-membered rings. Interestingly, the use of water as a reaction
medium can significantly enhance the potential of these photochemical cycload￾ditions. For instance, in 1982, the research group of Ramamurthy reported the154 7 Pericyclic Reactions in Aqueous Medium

photodimerization of coumarin 29 in pure water at room temperature, resulting
in the formation of syn-adduct 30 exclusively (Scheme 7.13). In contrast, when
the same reaction was performed in organic solvents like methanol and benzene,
a strong preference for the anti-adduct 31 was observed. Additionally, the quan￾tum yield of these reactions was significantly lower compared to that observed
in-water [61].
7.4 Electrocyclic Reactions In-Water (Ring Closure
and Ring Opening)
In this section of the chapter, we present the details of electrocyclic reactions per￾formed in an aqueous medium. When compared to the cycloaddition reactions, a
very small number of examples of electrocyclization reactions have been studied in
the water medium.
7.4.1 4𝛑-Electrocyclization Reactions
The first electrocyclic reaction in an aqueous medium was reported in 1979, by
Gaoni’s research group (Scheme 7.14a). The 3-alkyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-1(5)-
enes 32 were synthesized in good yields through the photo-4π-electrocyclization
of cyclic amines 33 in an aqueous acidic solution. These bicyclic amines 32 were
found to be unstable but can be stored under cold conditions. At 200 ∘C, these
bicyclic amines 32 went through the thermal electrocyclic ring opening to provide
the starting material 33 [62].

Later in 2003, Zhan and coworkers demonstrated the flash-photolytic, 4π-electro￾cyclic ring opening of benzocyclobutenone 34 in-water for the synthesis of
2-methylbenzoic acid through the in situ generation of 6-methylene-2,4-cyclohexa￾dienyli-deneketene 35 [63]. When the reaction was performed in aqueous
ammonia, the formation of benzamide was observed in addition to benzoic acid
(Scheme 7.14b).
Among the other unique features of water, its ability to enhance the high loss
factor (tan 𝛿 =0.123) makes it a valuable solvent for microwave-mediated syn￾thesis. Microwave irradiation rapidly heats water, making it a less polar pseudo￾organic solvent and increasing H+ concentration, suggesting it may function as
a weak acid [64]. In 2017, Nardi et al. demonstrated an efficient synthesis of
4,5-diaminocyclopent-2-enones 36 from furfural and different secondary amines
(Scheme 7.15). Microwave assistance was pivotal for the initial step, which involved
the exclusive formation of 4,5-bisubstituted cyclopentenone 36 (the kinetic product)
in just five minutes. In the following step, the aqueous environment transformed
the kinetic product 36 into 2,4-bisubstitued cyclopentenone 37 (a thermodynamic
product). The reaction gives trans-diastereomers through an intermediate enamine
38, which undergoes a thermal conrotatory 4π-electrocyclic ring closure [65].
In 2018, Afonso also developed the same reaction in water by employing Cu(OTf)2
as a catalyst for the selective synthesis of trans-4,5-diaminocyclopent-2-enones 36.

7.4.2 6𝛑-Electrocyclization Reactions
The research group of Lee hasreported a domino, Knoevenagel-6π-electrocyclization
in aqueous medium for the construction of pyran-fused heterocyclic systems 39
[66]. This reaction was found to be inefficient in various organic solvents, and the
best yield (91%) was achieved in water at 80 ∘C after four hours (Scheme 7.16a). This
strategy was further extended for the synthesis of pyran-fused quinoline natural
products such as ferprenin 40, flindersine 41, haplamine 42, and zanthosimuline 43
and their derivatives (Scheme 7.16b).
A microwave promoted 6π-electrocyclization reaction in-water was used for the
construction of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-fused quinoline-2-thiones 44 by employing
the corresponding ortho-heteroaryl-anilines and carbon disulfide (CS2). The reac￾tion was found to be sluggish and inefficient in various organic solvents in the basic
medium (DBU and K3PO4) [67]. The reaction may proceed through the isothio￾cyanate intermediate 45 (Scheme 7.16c).156 7 Pericyclic Reactions in Aqueous Medium

7.5 Sigmatropic Rearrangements In-Water
7.5.1 [3,3]-Sigmatropic Rearrangements
The [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements [68], e.g. Claisen rearrangement, Cope rear￾rangement, etc. are helpful techniquesin organic synthesisforthe generation of new
functional groups and novel cyclic systems. In the case of Cope rearrangement, the
reaction involves the conversion of 1,5-dienes (an all-carbon system) [69], on the
other hand, Claisen rearrangement [70] involves an allyl vinyl ether for the genera￾tion of 𝛾,𝛿-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.
In 1973, one of the earliest known aqueous Claisen rearrangements was reported
by R. Knowles (Scheme 7.17a). This involves the conversion of chorismate 46 to
prephenate 47, an important intermediate in the “Shikimate pathway” for gener￾ating aromatic amino acids [71].

Several research groups have also demonstrated the water influenced rate
acceleration during the Claisen rearrangement of several structurally distinct
substrates [72].
In 2005, Sharpless and coworkers [44a] found that the chloronaphthylether 48
(Scheme 7.17b, Z= O), exhibited a significant increase in reaction rate when per￾formed on-water Claisen rearrangement compared to when performed in neat as
well as in other organic solvents (100% yield on water vs. 73% in neat vs. 56% in
MeOH). Laterin 2013, McErlean and coworkers conducted an on-water, aza-Claisen
rearrangement using similar substrates 49 (Scheme 7.17b, Z= NR), and isolated an
impressive yield of 93% within 48 hours for 50, when compared to the reaction in
organic solvents, where no reaction was observed [73].
7.5.2 [2,3]-Sigmatropic Rearrangements
In 1994, the research group of Otera discovered a stereoselective [2,3]-sigmatropic
rearrangement of 𝛾-hydroxyalkyl 𝛾-alkoxyallylic sulfoxides 51 in-water [74]. The
𝛾-hydroxyl group has a longer-range effect on the sulfonyl group, thereby resulting
in the more selective generation of E-isomer (Scheme 7.18a).

In 2007, Wang and coworkers developed a Rh-catalyzed, [2,3]-sigmatropic rear￾rangement of sulfonium ylides in aqueous medium (Scheme 7.18b). These ylides
are generated in situ from the reaction between Rh-carbenoid (formed from the cor￾responding aryldiazoacetates 52) and allylic/propargylic sulfides 53 [75].
7.6 Ene Reactions
No examples of in-water ene reactions were reported in the literature, whereas
only one example of a corresponding on-water ene reaction was reported. The
research group of Sharpless reported an ene reaction of highly water-insoluble
azodicarboxylates 54 against cyclohexene [76] and 𝛼-pinene [77] by utilizing
the “on-water” approach. In the case of cyclohexene, vigorous stirring with the
azo-diester 54 in water provided the enhanced rate and yield compared to the same
reaction in organic solvents or neat conditions (Scheme 7.19). In benzene, after158 7 Pericyclic Reactions in Aqueous Medium

hours at 50 ∘C. However, the reactions of 𝛼-pinene gave comparable yields of 56 in
organic solvents vs. neat vs. on-water conditions.
7.7 Summary and Conclusions
To summarize, water, the greenest solvent, has been well utilized as the solvent
as well as promoter for various types of pericyclic reactions, such as cycloaddition
reactions, electrocyclic reactions, sigmatropic rearrangements, and group transfer
reactions, in organic synthesis. We have detailed the hydrophobic effect and hydro￾gen bonding effect of water on the reaction rates, regio- and stereochemical selec￾tivities of this special class of reactions. Due to page constraints, in each case we
have presented only limited examples but cited the additional relevant references
appropriately for the sake of readers. We hope that this chapter will give an flavor
of the most up-to-date developments in the field of pericyclic reactions in aqueous
medium.

Olefin Metathesis In-Water: Recent Progress and Challenges
Bengi Özgün Öztürk

8.1 Introduction
Olefin metathesis emerged as an efficient catalytic method to construct advanced
organic structures through the formation of carbon–carbon double bonds in an effi￾cient manner [1–4]. The invention of an air-stable and functional group-tolerant
ruthenium-based Grubbs type catalyst has opened a new era in metathesis chem￾istry, expanding both the scope and application areas of Grubbs first (G1), second
(G2), Hoveyda–Grubbs first (HG1)-, and second (HG2)-generation catalysts in both
academia and industry (Figure 8.1) [5–7].
Olefin metathesis is usually carried out in classical organic solvents such as
dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, and other polar anhydrous solvents [8].
The adaptation of catalytic reactions to aqueous media is of great importance con￾sidering the environmentally negative impact of chlorinated organic solvents [9].
However, the hydrophobic nature of both the Grubbs/Hoveyda–Grubbs catalyst
and the olefinic substrates tackles the adaptation of olefin metathesis to aqueous
media. Therefore, for the last two decades, there have been on-going challenges for
the adaptation of metathesis catalytic systems to aqueous media [10].
The first example of aqueous olefin metathesis was introduced by Grubbs and
coworker. The integration of ionic groups on the phosphine group has led to the
water-soluble Grubbs first-generation analogs (1, 2) (Figure 8.2) [11]. Although 1, 2,
and 3 exhibit water solubility to an extent, their stability in an aqueous medium in
metathesis reactions such as ring-closing metathesis (RCM), cross-metathesis, and
self-metathesis reactions is limited, and only a stable performance was observed
in ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reactions of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic norbornene-based monomers using these first-generation catalysts.
Phosphine-free Hoveyda–Grubbs analog 4 bearing a hydrophilic non-ionic group
(PEG) on the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) moiety exhibits considerable per￾formance in RCM reactions of hydrophilic dienes bearing cationic amine groups
(Scheme 8.1).

Olefin Metathesis Catalysts
As an alternative to phosphine ligand modification, benzylidene or alkylidene can be
modified with ionic-tagged groups to improve the hydrophilic character of metathe￾sis catalysts. Schanz and hisresearch group synthesized cationic phosphine (10) and
dimethyl amine-substituted benzylidene analogs of Grubbs catalysts through alkyli￾dene exchange reactions of Grubbs first-generation catalysts (11–12) (Figure 8.3)
[12]. ROMP reactions of cationic norbornene derivatives were carried out using a
2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)/dichloromethane (CH2Cl2 ) mixture (v/v: 1/1) using
catalysts 10–12. Catalyst 10 has formed a uniform solution in the reaction mixture
due to itsionic nature; however, catalysts 11 and 12 required a protonation step using

two mol equivalents of HCl. Due to the protonation of amine groups on 11 and 12,
which affects the electronic environment of the catalysts, the performance of 11 and
12 was boosted in ROMP reactions. The second role of the acid addition isto prevent
the rebinding of dissociated tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) ligands through the pro￾tonation of PCy3 to H+PCy3
−. The strategy of integrating protonable pH sensitive
dimethylamino groups on metathesis catalysts was expanded to Hoveyda–Grubbs
second-generation analogs by Grela and his research team [13].
The modification of the chelating ortho-isopropoxybenzylidene group with
the diethylamine group results in pH-sensitive second-generation ruthenium
catalyst systems. The main principle in this catalytic system is to transform the
non-polar nature of the catalyst to more polar character through protonation. Also
following the protonation, the electron-donating nature of −NEt2 has shifted to an
electron-withdrawing group effect due to the formation of −NEt2H+. The protona￾tion has resulted in an activity increase in RCM and enyne-metathesis reactions in
organic media. Following these innovative studies, Grela group has prepared several
HG2 analogs bearing quaternary ammonium groups on various ligand positions
(Figure 8.4). [14, 15]. These catalysts showed superior performance in RCM and
enyne metathesisreactions of hydrophobic olefinic substratesin aqueous media and
can be recycled easily. Complex 13 showed high silica gel affinity in organic media,
allowing the easy separation of the catalyst from the reaction media and obtaining
pure metathesis products below 1 ppm Ru contamination. To improve the water
solubility of 13, a second quaternary ammonium group was attached to the chelating
ortho-isopropoxy benzylidene moiety. The isopropyl group on ether oxygen was
substituted with a cationic 1,1-dimethylpiperidine group, which led to improved
water solubility of the complex. In neat water, the RCM reaction of ionic diene
molecules reached 96, 88, and 95% conversions. Complexes 13 and 14 can easily be
recycled from the reaction media through extraction with diethyl ether. The product
remains in the ether phase, while catalysts 13 and 14 remain in the aqueous
phase [13a]. Grubbs and coworker utilized quaternary ammonium-substituted
NHC and chelating isopropoxybenzyldine groups to catalyze ROMP and RCM
reactions in neat water [11a]. The catalyst 15, however, showed poor performance
in cross-metathesis of allyl alcohol derivatives in water, yielding the isomerization
product propionaldehyde in most cases. The catalyst 15 also failed to catalyze

the cross-metathesis of various olefinic reactants bearing different hydrophilic
substituents such as amino acids, carbohydrates, and ammonium salts.
Schanz and his team have shown that 1-methylimidazole can be used as an
inhibitor for Grubbs catalysts through the formation of an 18 electron complex
with the substitution of the PCy3 group with two moles of 1-methylimidazole
groups (Scheme 8.2) [16]. The so-called “latent” catalysts can be activated through
the addition of acids (HCl or H3PO4) to protonate imidazole groups, yielding 14
electron-active species in the reaction medium. The catalytic performance of 16 was
tested in RCM reactions of diethyl diallyl malonate in d6-benzene in the presence
of 12 mol equivalent of H3PO4, reaching an 82.8 % conversion after one hour.
However, the catalyst is not recyclable and still requires relatively higher catalytic
loadings (5% mol) to reach quantitative conversion values in RCM reactions. To
address this issue, poly(vinylimidazole)-supported G1 catalyst was developed to
obtain a water-compatible latent metathesis catalyst (17) for RCM and ROMP
applications of hydrophobic substrates [17]. Catalyst 17 showed latent behavior
and can be activated through the introduction of excess HCl in water in the RCM
of diethyl diallylmalonate, reaching a conversion of 99% after 24 hours with 5%
Ru loading. The catalyst can be recycled up to three run in RCM. For ROMP
reactions of hydrophobic norbornene derivatives, the addition of a non-ionic
surfactant (Tween20) is required to prevent the coagulation of the growing ROMP
polymer in an aqueous medium during metathesis reactions. Following this study,
ruthenium indenylidene catalysts bearing imidazole or morpholine-substituted
bidentate (N,O) Schiff base ligands (18, 19) (Scheme 8.6) were reported for aqueous
olefin metathesis applications [18, 19]. The activity of the catalysts 17–19 can
be tuned by varying the HCl/Ru (mol/mol) ratio in aqueous ROMP reactions of
hydrophobic monomers, allowing a high control over the molecular weight of the
resulting polymers.
Another strategy in aqueous olefin metathesis is to use surfactant-like non-ionic
polymers as dispersive agents for both hydrophobic catalysts and olefinic reagents
[20, 21]. The non-ionic groups can be tagged directly on various ligand positions,
including benzylidene and NHC moieties, on metathesis catalysts or can be used as
an additive to stabilize the non-modified metathesis catalysts within hydrophobic
compartments of micelle structures. Hydrophilic polymersubstitution on Grubbs or
Hoveyda–Grubbs catalysts alters the polarity of the complex, which allows the recy￾cling of the catalysts with a suitable polar organic solvent after aqueous metathesis
reactions. The integration of hydrophilic PEG groups on the chelating isopropoxy￾benzylidene moiety of HG2 analogs was reported by several research groups
[22–26]. Owing to the hydrophilic nature of the PEG group, the catalysts can be
dispersed in an aqueous medium, including acetone/water and methanol/water
mixtures for CM and RCM applications (Figure 8.5). In contrast to PCy3 groups on
G1 and G2, NHC ligands do not dissociate from the ruthenium complex during
metathesis reactions and stabilize 14 electron intermediates through electron and
steric effects exerted by the NHC structure. The substituents on the N-atoms of the
NHC group play an important role in the stability of the complex in metathesis
reactions. 2,4,6-Mesitylene or 2,6-disopropylphenyl groups are usually preferred inRu

commercial Grubbs and Hoveyda–Grubbs-type metathesis catalysts. The modifica￾tion of the NHC group can be carried out through different positions of the NHC
group [24–26]. Grubbs and his research group substituted one of the mesitylene
groups with the benzyl end-functionalized PEG group to obtain a water-soluble
metathesis catalyst [25]. Although the catalyst performed well in ROMP of both
exo and endo-norbornene derivative 25 in HCl/H2O mixture, it showed poor
performance in RCM and CM reactions (Scheme 8.3). The main problem of 23 in
metathesis reactions is the steric environment of the NHC ligand. When compared
to SIMes ligands, the NHC group on 23 lacks one mesitylene substituent on one
of the nitrogen groups, which dramatically decreases the stability of the activated
complex in aqueous media, yielding lower turnover numbers in the catalytic cycle
in RCM and CM reactions. In addition, the double bond in the backbone of the NHC
ligand drastically decreases the σ-donating ability of the ligand when compared
to saturated analog SIMes. To address the current challenge, the position of the
PEG group was altered and substituted on the NHC backbone (24), which did not
significantly affect the electron-donating ability of the NHC ligand but improved
the polarity of the complex, leading to a hydrophilic metathesis catalyst [26].8.2 Ionic, Non-Ionic, and Amphiphilic Group-Tagged Olefin Metathesis Catalysts 171

Figure 8.6 Grubbs and Hoveyda–Grubbs catalysts immobilized on amphiphilic polymers.
As an alternative to hydrophilic polymers, amphiphilic block polymers are also
attached to the Grubbs and Hoveyda–Grubbs catalysts to obtain a water-compatible
catalytic system [27]. The Grubbs catalyst is mainly attached to the hydropho￾bic block through covalent bonding, thus stabilizing the Grubbs catalyst in the
hydrophobic domains of micelle structures in-water. Additionally, the hydrophobic
compartments in aqueous micelle structures provide hydrophobic confined spaces
for hydrophobic olefinic substrates, improving the reaction rates to some extent.
Isopropoxy styrene modified block poly(2-oxazoline) derivatives are used to immo￾bilize Hoveyda–Grubbs second-generation catalyst in hydrophobic domains of the
block polymer (Catalyst 26) (Figure 8.6) [28].
The presence of two chelating isopropoxy stryrene-substituted blocks on
the hydrophobic chain increases the robustness of the catalyst in the aqueous
medium. A latent ruthenium catalyst was reported in 2018 using imidazole￾substituted amphiphilic block ROMP polymers [29]. Diester-substituted ROMP
polymers were end-functionalized using allyl-end-capped PEG polymers as chain￾transfer agents. The post-polymerization modification of ester groups with a
3-aminopropylimidazole group, followed by in situ hydrogenation of the ROMP
polymer, yielded imidazole-substituted amphiphilic polymers. The integration of
Grubb’s first-generation catalyst hasled to the formation of a latent catalytic system.
The catalyst 27 has formed spherical micelle structures with an average size of
89.69 (±34) nm, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis.
The addition of HCl (aq.) to the reaction media activates the catalyst for RCM
reactions in the aqueous medium. The integration of lipophilic and hydrophilic
chains and isopropoxy styrene groups through an aromatic binder molecule has led
to a unique Hoveyda–Grubbs-type catalyst (28) that showed excellent reusability
up to ten runs in RCM of hydrophobic dienes in water [30] (Figure 8.6). The
RCM performance of the amphiphilic catalysts; 26, 27, and 28 was tested in the
RCM of diethyl diallyl malonate (29) in neat water, and all three catalysts reached
higher conversion values even under low catalytic loadings (Figure 8.6). In an
alternative to NHC and alkylidene ligand modification, Buchmeister and his
research team utilized fluoro group functionalized poly(2-oxazoline) derivatives for
the immobilization of Hoveyda–Grubbs second-generation catalyst (29) through
anionic ligand exchange reactions (Scheme 8.4). The catalyst 29 was used for the172 8 Olefin Metathesis In-Water: Recent Progress and Challenges

enyne metathesis polymerization of diynes in aqueous media, yielding nano-sized
micellar macromolecular particles [31].
The addition of supramolecular additives such as surfactants and amphiphiles is
anotherstrategy to conduct olefin metathesisin water. Nonionic or ionic surfactants
can be employed to obtain a stable emulsion in water for hydrophobic Grubbs and
Hoveyda–Grubbs catalysts and olefinic substrates [32]. Ionic surfactants; sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDSO3Na) and non-ionic surfac￾tants; polyoxyethylenesorbitanemonopalmitate (Tween-40) and decaoxyethyelene
dodecyl ether(Brij30 or 35) were employed on the RCM of diethyldiallyl malonate in
water using a substrate/surfactant ratio between 2.5–10 (mol mol−1) in the presence
of G1 at room temperature (Figure 8.7). The control experiments showed that the
RCM reaction reached 51% conversion within one hour in the absence of any surfac￾tants. No improvementin yield was observed when non-ionic surfactants(Tween-40,
Brij-35) and anionic surfactants; SDSSO3Na were used in water media (Table 8.1).
However, the performance of the system was drastically increased when anionic
surfactant SDS was employed under identical reaction conditions, reaching 96 %
conversion within 30 minutes of reaction time under 5% mol G1 loading in water
media [33]. Following this study, Lipshutz utilized a vitamin E-based surfactant;
polyoxyethanyl α-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS), in an aqueous RCM of diethyl dial￾lylmalonate derivatives and cross-metathesis of allylbenzene and tert-butylacrylate
using G1 and G2. The CM reaction proceeded with high trans (E) selectivity, and
among the other tested surfactants, only the PTS-based micellar system yielded the
corresponding product in 97% yield (Table 8.2) [34]. This strategy was also extended
to the RCM of different diene molecules with varying chain lengths to form six￾or seven-membered ring structures in water [35]. The same research group also
showed the effect of pH changes in aqueous CM reactions using 0.02 M KHSO4 and
a PTS/water mixture at 22C in the presence of G2 (2 mol %). Recently, the effect
of pH and salt concentration on the metathesis activity of Grubbs-type catalysts in
water was investigated by Foster et al. [36]. The addition of KCl, NaCl, or tetra￾butylammonium chloride (TBAC) improved the stability and performance of the
catalyst in aqueous ROMP reactions. The main role of the chloride ion is to preventOSO3

with β-cyclodextrin [38, 39]. The ruthenium content of the final product can
be decreased to 53 ppm after filtration, indicating the efficiency of host-guest
interaction between two molecules. A hydrophilic natural polymer, alginate, was
used as an encapsulation agent for Hoveyda–Grubbs second (HG2)-generation
catalysts for aqueous metathesis applications [40, 41]. Pauly et al. have modified
alginate beads with an n-octyl group to improve the diffusion of hydrophobic
olefinic substrates into the alginate beads through creating hydrophobic domains
[40]. Although the performance of 33 (HG2@Alg) is quite comparable to HG2 in
neat water, the encapsulation allowed the efficient recycling of the catalyst after the
metathesisreactions. In 2022, HG2 loaded on hydrophobic nanomesoporous carbon
and magnetic γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were encapsulated within calcium alginate
beads. The mesoporous carbon allowed the homogeneous distribution of HG2
catalysts throughout the alginate matrix and also provided hydrophobic surfaces
for olefinic substrates [41]. The catalyst 34 (HG2@MC@Fe@Alg) showed high
performance in the RCM of diethyldiallyl malonate, and the catalyst can be easily
separated from the reaction mixture with the help of a magnet. The performance
comparison of 33 and 34 was given in Scheme 8.6. Another encapsulation strategy is
based on the kinetic protection of quaternary ammonium-tagged Hoveyda–Grubbs
catalysts, namely, Aquamet (13), within metal-organic cages with the general
formula of [Pt6L4](NO3)12 in aqueous medium [42]. Although Aquamet was
effectively encapsulated within the void of the cage structure, the encapsulation of
G1, G2, and HG2 failed due to the low polarity of the complexes.

8.4 Conclusion
In summary, for the last two decades, huge progress has been achieved in the adap￾tation of olefin metathesis reactions to aqueous media using different strategies.
Water-soluble ruthenium catalysts, as well as emulsion-based ruthenium catalytic
systems, can catalyze the ROMP, CM, and RCM reactions of both hydrophilic and
hydrophobic olefinic substrates to an extent. The elimination of organic solvents
in metathesis reactions not only improves the sustainability of the process but also
reduces production costs. In addition, the recycling of water-compatible catalysts in
the aqueous phase allows the production of olefinic products with minimum ruthe￾nium contamination, which is very important for the pharmaceutical industry [43].
Recently, protein- and enzyme-supported metathesis catalyst systems have emerged
as an alternative to the currentstrategiesto conduct olefin metathesisin pre-definedReferences 177
confinements in water [44]. However, the intolerance of biomolecules to pH and
the salt environment of the aqueous media is an ongoing challenge in the field.
Considering the recent evolvement shows us that aqueous olefin metathesis can be
an alternative to traditional industrial metathesis protocols.

9.1 Introduction
Oxidation reactions are fundamental reactions in synthetic organic chemistry and
have been traditionally conducted using stoichiometric quantities of inorganic or
organic oxidants or metal-based reagents. The deployment of water as the solvent
in oxidations is of great importance from the sustainable point of view. Oxidations
in an aqueous medium have been developed by employing water-compatible
complexes for metal-based catalytic oxidations and the use of oxidants like H2O2
or molecular oxygen [1]. Either the reaction follows true catalysis in water or a
phase transfer catalyst is used to carry the oxidant to the organic phase [2]. Recent
developments in alkene epoxidation and the oxidation of alcohols, aldehydes, and
ketones in water are included in this chapter, while the reports covered in previous
reviews are excluded [3]. The current discussion on oxidation reactions will be
limited to those catalyzed by water-soluble metal complexes, organocatalysts, and
metal nanoparticle systems under true catalysis in water without the use of any
organic solvent.
Reduction reactions in water are not much explored. The available methodolo￾gies are those in which water compatible catalytic systems or reducing agents are
used. Water’s pH-sensitive behavior and specific ligand characteristics make it a dis￾tinctive solvent that can be exploited to increase the selectivity and effectiveness of
hydrogenation processes. We will deal with a number of reduction reactions in this
chapter, such as the hydrogenation of C=O, C=C, and C=N bonds and aromatic
nitro compounds in water as the medium, and the reactions are classified based on
the catalyst used.

9.2 Oxidation Reactions in Water
9.2.1 Epoxidation of Alkenes in Water
The synthesis of epoxides via the oxidation of C=C bonds is a major conversion in
organic chemistry, and sustainable methods of utilizing water-compatible catalysts
and oxidants have been developed over the years.
Tan and coworkers reported the synthesis and catalytic activity of thermo￾responsive catalytic nanoreactors (chiral salen-based Cr(III) complexes encapsu￾lated in an amphiphilic copolymer) for the asymmetric epoxidation of alkenes in
2019 [4]. Compared to the conventional Cr(salen) systems, the catalytic nanore￾actors offered higher yields (up to 95%) and selectivity (ee up to 99%) for the
asymmetric epoxidation of varied alkenes in water. Moreover, the catalytic system
hindered the undesired hydrolysis of products, and the catalytic nanoreactor can be
easily recovered and reused.
A Mn-salen micellar nanoreactor was developed for the enantioselective
epoxidation of alkenes in water by Sfrazzetto and coworkers [5]. The catalytic
nanoreactor was formed from a Mn-salen catalyst functionalized with a choline
group and a long-chain aliphatic group, forming a surfactant catalyst which was
used with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) as the surfactant to form a
nanoreactor for the epoxidation. The epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene and
6-CN-2,2-dimethylchromene afforded high conversions and enantioselectivity in
the presence of NaClO as an oxidant in water (Scheme 9.1).

Bagherzadeh and coworkers prepared a novel dioxo MoVI complex with a
Schiff base ligand, and the catalytic activity was studied for alkene epoxidation
in water [6]. Epoxidation of a range of olefins was performed in the presence of
0.2 mol% of Mo catalyst and TBHP (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) in water at 80 ∘C for
five hours to render the corresponding epoxides with higher turnover numbers
(Scheme 9.2). Notably, epoxidation of cyclooctene was achieved with a turnover
number greater than 1400. In the following year, Pisk and coworkers successfully
employed molybdenum hydrazonato complexes as catalysts for the epoxidation
of cyclooctene using TBHP as the oxidant with good activity and selectivity in
water [7].

The cobalt bis(dicarbollide) complex (Na[3,3-Co(𝜂5-1,2-C2B9H11) was utilized as
a photoredox catalyst for the olefin oxidation to access diverse epoxides in water,9.2 Oxidation Reactions in Water 181
by Teixidor and coworkersin 2021 [8]. This catalyst exhibited high solubility in water
and the high oxidizing ability of the Co4+/3+ couple ensured effective olefin epoxi￾dation. Importantly, epoxidation of varied aryl and aliphatic olefins was performed
with a low catalyst loading of 0.01 mol% and offered excellent selectivity and a high
turnover number of the corresponding epoxides in 15 minutes.
In 2022, Liu and coworkers put forward a green epoxidation protocol using a
titanosilicate/H2O2 catalytic system in water as the solvent (Scheme 9.3) [9]. Their
studies on propylene epoxidation showed that the catalytic activity of the system
is enhanced when the optimal H2O structure is achieved in the reaction. They
also concluded that the introduction of alkali metal ions like K+ ions and organic
solvents can break the hydrogen bonds and therefore attain the favored H2O
structure, improving the efficiency of the system.

An Fe(III)-bis(phenol) diamine complex immobilized upon silica-coated
magnetic nanoparticles bearing amine functional groups was prepared, and
its catalytic activity for the epoxidation of varied olefins was studied [10]. This
heterogeneous catalyst carried out efficient olefin epoxidation in the presence of
SO3
2− as a co-reductant at room temperature in water, and the catalyst could be
magnetically recovered. They also proposed a novel TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-
piperidinyloxy)-assisted epoxidation pathway which furnished different epoxides in
moderate to good yields.
9.2.2 Oxidation of Alcohols to Carbonyl Compounds in Water
9.2.2.1 Oxidation of Alcohols to Aldehydes or Ketones
Oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols selectively to the corresponding
aldehydes and ketones forms a key reaction in organic synthesis. The deployment
of water as an eco-friendly solvent for this transformation is achieved using
water-soluble homogeneous catalysts, supported heterogeneous catalysts or hybrid
catalysts that work at the interface of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.
Along with metal- or metal-free reactions, in water, oxidations are developed under
photocatalytic conditions.
Fujita and coworkers developed a water-soluble iridium-based catalyst for the
dehydrogenative oxidation of secondary alcohols to access ketones [11]. This
approach to acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols in aqueous media presented
a greener alternative to other known methods, as molecular hydrogen is the sole
byproduct formed. A range of aliphatic and aromatic secondary alcohols under￾went successful oxidation in the presence of 3 mol% of Ir-catalyst in water under
reflux conditions for 20 hours to afford good yields of the corresponding ketones
(Scheme 9.4).182 9 Oxidation and Reduction Reactions in Water

In the same year, Lee and coworkers put forward a method for the acceptorless
dehydrogenation of alcohols to the respective carbonyl compounds with the use of
rhodium based nanoparticles in water as the solvent [12].
A novel transition metal-free method for the oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic
secondary alcohols to access diverse ketones in moderate to excellent yields was
achieved by Shen and coworkers using 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane N-oxyl (ABNO,
6 mol%)/tert-butyl nitrite (5 mol%)/KPF6 (4 mol%) as the catalytic system in water
[13]. This green and efficient reaction was conducted in the presence of O2 to enable
the aerobic oxidation of a variety of secondary alcohols in water.
In 2023, Wang and coworkers prepared a mesoporous carbon-supported metal￾based catalyst (WO3–WS2 anchored on mesoporous S, N co-doped carbon) and its
catalytic performance forthe oxidation of alcohols using H2O2 as an oxidant in water
under mild conditions was studied [14].
A sustainable approach in alcohol oxidation is photocatalyzed oxidation using
different photocatalysts. Recentreports on photocatalyzed alcohol oxidation to alde￾hydes, ketones, or acids in water medium are summarized in Scheme 9.5.

Scheme 9.5 Photocatalyzed oxidation of alcohol to the corresponding aldehydes or
ketones using different photocatalysts.
In 2018, Fu and coworkers described the oxidation of benzyl alcohol derivatives
to the corresponding aryl aldehydes or ketones using a hybrid photocatalytic system
composed of CoP, cobalt phosphide combined with CdS [15]. Here, the CoP/CdS
material (5 wt%) was employed as a visible-light catalyst (LED (λ>420 nm)) for the
photoinduced oxidation at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. This
reaction in water is accompanied by the evolution of hydrogen and the catalytic
reaction is atom economical from a sustainable point of view.
In the subsequent year, Muhler and coworkers reported a strategy for the oxi￾dation of alcohols in the presence of Fe-doped SrTiO3 as the photocatalyst [16].9.2 Oxidation Reactions in Water 183
Here, the anaerobic photooxidation was carried out under visible light (300W Xe
lamp (>400 nm)) and was accomplished with simultaneous H2 generation over
Fe-doped SrTiO3 with Pt nanoparticles in water. The activation of alpha-C—H
bonds in alcohols, accompanied by the avoidance of over-oxidation of the carbonyl
compounds is attributed to the Fe-doped photocatalytic surface. The method
provided an eco-friendly route to access carbonyl compounds using an economical
photocatalyst under mild conditions.
In 2021, a method employing CdS/NiAl-LDH, a combination of CdS quantum
dots and ultrathin NiAl-LDH nanosheets, was developed to ensure high selec￾tivity and yields for alcohol oxidation reactions under visible light [17]. Herein,
CdS/NiAl-LDH acted as a type-II heterojunction photocatalyst and exhibited better
stability, efficient oxidation, and an enhanced rate of hydrogen evolution in a clean
water medium. With the use of the catalyst, they achieved highly selective oxidation
to synthesize anisaldehyde, preventing possible overoxidation.
Organo-photocatalysts are also known to conduct the selective oxidation of
alcohols to carbonyl compounds in simple and eco-friendly conditions. A visible￾light-induced (green LED, 525 nm, 3W) oxidation of differently substituted benzylic
alcohols to the respective aldehydes or ketones was accomplished by Chen and
coworkers in the presence of a Ni-based dual catalyst system comprising 1 mol%
of eosin Y as the photocatalyst and 7.5 mol% of Ni-MPA (NiII-3-mercaptopropionic
acid) [18]. The strategy presented an eco-friendly and mild route with H2 as the sole
byproduct.
In 2023, the selective photocatalytic oxidation of 2- and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohols
in water using TiO2 P25 asthe photocatalyst wasreported [19]. Herein, partial oxida￾tion of 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to aldehyde and oxidation of 4-hydroxybenzyl alco￾hol to the respective acid were achieved, with the latter exhibiting higher selectivity.
The differential selectivity of the alcohols was studied by monitoring the surface
processes and different adsorption mechanisms were suggested.
9.2.2.2 Oxidation of Alcohols or Aldehydes to Carboxylic Acids
The directsynthesis of carboxylic acids via sustainable methods, including reactions
employing water asthe solvent, is of great attention due to their applicability in both
the laboratory and industries.
Bera and coworkers described [RuH(CO)(py-NP)(PPh3)2]Cl (5 mol%) as the cata￾lyst for the conversion of aryl and aliphatic primary alcohols to the respective car￾boxylic acid salts with the generation of H2 [20]. This reaction was performed in
alkaline water and occurred through acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohol, fol￾lowed by a rapid OH−/H2O attack on the Ru-bound aldehyde formed in the initial
step. Interestingly, amino alcohols were also reactive, suggesting the utility of this
dehydrogenative protocol toward the direct synthesis of amino acids (Scheme 9.6).
Ru(III) complexes composed of 3-(p-substituted phenyl azo)-4-hydroxy-l,2-
naphthoquinones-based ligands were employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl
alcohols to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives by Almalki in 2021. The
conversion was accomplished in an aqueous KOH medium and K2S2O8 as the
co-oxidant at ambient temperature [21].184 9 Oxidation and Reduction Reactions in Water

In the same year, a transition metal-free I2/NaOH-catalyzed oxidation of alco￾hols and aldehydes toward the direct synthesis of varied carboxylic acids with
water as the reaction solvent was described by Elias and coworkers (Scheme 9.7)
[22]. The reaction proceeds through an initial dehydrogenation of alcohol and a
sequential attack of H2O on the aldehyde. The key highlights of the method include
large-scale applicability, circumvention of purification, enlarged substrate scope,
and use of green solvent.

A range of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing group substituted aryl alco￾hols efficiently reacted under the optimized conditions of 20 mol% of NaCl, 50 mol%
of aqueous NaOH and TBHP (4 equiv.) at 70 ∘C for 10–16 hours to furnish the
carboxylic acids in high yields (Scheme 9.8). They even successfully demonstrated

catalytic system [24]. Herein, the oxidative cleavage of the C—C bond of aromatic
ketones and benzyl nitriles was carried out in the presence of NaOH as the base

work include the wide substrate scope, additive-free conditions, and gram-scale
applicability. They also accomplished the synthesis of industrially important
acids, including salicylic acid, anthranilic acid, terephthalic acid, and 2,5-furan
dicarboxylic acid (FDCA).
Sun and coworkers established the oxidative transformation of furfural to furan￾carboxylic acid utilizing a commercially available Mn-Cu bimetallic oxide as the
catalyst [25]. The furfural oxidation was successfully performed using Mn2Cu1Ox in
water, and an excellent conversion rate of 99% was obtained (Scheme 9.10). Notably,
the heterogeneous catalyst, Mn2Cu1Ox, could be recovered and reused for five cycles.
The authors suggested the importance of the doping of CuO which enhances the

The protocol proceeded through the formation of hypervalent iodine intermediates
from aldehydes and their sequential interception by aldehyde hydrate in the pres￾ence of water(Scheme 9.11). Underthe optimal conditions of 10 mol%of PhI at 50 ∘C
under an O2 atmosphere, aryl aldehydes and linear/cyclic aliphatic aldehydes were
transformed into differently functionalized carboxylic acids.

hydrogen source in water as the solvent (Scheme 9.12) [27]. Not only can simple
ketones be easily reduced, but also ketones with α- or β-functionalization. Another
characteristic of the reduction is that it tolerates a wide range of functional groups
well, including alkyloxy, aryloxy, cyano, halogen, ester, and phenol.
In 2019, Fujita and coworkers disclosed a strategy for the transfer hydrogena￾tion of aldehydes and ketones to the corresponding alcohols using 0.1–1 mol% of an
iridium complex asthe catalyst and glucose asthe hydrogen donor[28].In this proto￾col, further investigations showed that hydrogen was transferred from the hydroxyl
group at the C1 position in glucose to the substrates. This paper’s findings were the
first instance of transfer hydrogenation performed in water with glucose functioning
as a hydrogen donor.
Chemoselective, pH-dependent and mild transfer hydrogenation of α,β￾unsaturated aldehydes using water as reaction medium was put forward by
Luo and team (Scheme 9.13) [29]. This Ir-catalyzed reaction yielded unsaturated
alcohols with HCOOH (pH ≈2) as the hydride source and saturated alcohols with
HCOONa (pH ≈8) as the hydride source. A broad variety of functional groups, both
electron-withdrawing and electron-donating, were compatible with the reaction
condition. The pH value was found to be essential for the chemoselectivity of the
reaction.

hydrogen. A readily available aminobenzimidazole ligand was present in the
iridium catalyst, which afforded enantioselectivity up to 99%.
Similarly, a reaction was developed for the iridium/imidazoline-catalyzed asym￾metric transfer hydrogenation of quinoline in water (Scheme 9.15) [31]. With
mild conditions, it is possible to successfully convert a variety of quinolines and
N-heteroaryl structures into the corresponding products with moderate to good
enantioselectivities.

Albrecht and coworkers put forward a mild, iridium-catalyzed protocol for the
reduction of quinoline with hydrogen (5 atm) [32]. This strategy provided the corre￾sponding product, tetrahydroquinoline, utilizing water as the medium.
9.3.2 Ruthenium-Catalyzed Reduction
Ruthenium-catalyzed synthesis of furfuryl alcohol in water through the hydrogena￾tion of furfural was developed by Rodríguez-Ramos and coworkers [33].
Öztürk and Öztürk disclosed the transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones
using water as the medium [34]. Here, the first-generation ruthenium-indenylidene
complex (dichloro(3- phenyl-1H-inden-1-ylidene)bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)ruth￾enium(II) was employed as the catalyst along with dodecyltrimethylammonium
chloride and Tween 20 as the surfactants, and sodium formate as the reducing
agent. Strong functional group compatibility was demonstrated by the catalyst,
and there was not a noticeable difference in reactivity upon varying the position of
the substituents. Olefins were employed and sequential cross-metathesis-transfer
hydrogenation reactions were also performed.188 9 Oxidation and Reduction Reactions in Water
Yoon and coworkers reported the transfer hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds
to alcohols in water via Ru catalysis [35]. A Ru catalyst based on a covalent triazine
framework containing bipyridyl units was used asthe recyclable, heterogeneous cat￾alyst and environmentally friendly HCOONa as the hydrogen donor (Scheme 9.16).
The catalyst exhibited high activity in the case of several aldehydes and ketones.
Excellent yields were achieved when aromatic ketones containing both electron-rich
and electron-deficient functional groups were transformed into alcohols. Furfuryl
alcohol was obtained from furfuraldehyde. Throughout the recycling tests, the cata￾lyst exhibited high activity, and it continued to do so until the fifth cycle.

Jia and coworkers established a green protocol for the polymer ionic liquid (PIL)-
functionalized ruthenium complex-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of
aliphatic ketones in water with high selectivity [36]. Without enduring an impor￾tant decrease in enantioselectivity, the catalyst could potentially be retrieved and
recycled up to nine cycles with ease and efficiency. It was established that the
enantioselectivity increased with increasing the alkyl chain length. Under the opti￾mized condition, aromatic ketone, acetophenone was also examined, and excellent
enantioselectivity was achieved.
9.3.3 Palladium-Catalyzed Reduction
Lipshutz and coworkers reported the hydrogenation of olefins at room temperature
in water (Scheme 9.17) [37]. The protocol used only ppm levels of heterogeneous
Pd/C along with 1 atm H2 gas, and the reaction proceeded in a safe and chemoselec￾tive manner. Reduction was possible for a wide range of alkenesincluding differently
conjugated, terminal, and highly substituted internal. Several natural products that
include olefins have also been subjected to this approach. The fact that they can
be effectively hydrogenated without affecting other functional groups points to the
extremely mild conditions entailed.

Liu and coworkers discussed the utilization of Pd/UiO-66 in the reduction of
furfural to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol which is a green solvent [38]. Under mild
conditions, Pd/UiO-66 showed excellent activity, by fully converting furfural to
tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (100% selectivity) with a pressure of H2 as 1.0 MPa at a
temperature greater than 50 ∘C.9.3 Reduction Reactions in Water 189
Palladium nanoparticle-catalyzed reduction of epoxides under mild conditions
was explored by Roucoux and coworkers(Scheme 9.18) [39]. The reduction involved
the selective conversion of diverse epoxides to the corresponding alcohols under
basic conditions. The reaction proceeded in the presence of the heterogeneous

[40]. This heterogeneous protocol was found to occur in water at room temperature,
using NaBH4 to reduce nitroarenes to the corresponding amines with high selec￾tivities and yields. Six runs of the reaction were conducted without a discernible

9.3.4 Rhodium-Catalyzed Reduction
Ratovelomanana-Vidal and coworkers achieved an environmentally sustainable
reaction toward the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of α-methoxy β-ketoesters
[41]. The reaction was performed using a new rhodium(III) complex as the catalyst.
When using sodium formate in water, the reaction was effective and through a
dynamic kinetic resolution procedure, the syn α-methoxy β-hydroxyesters were pro￾duced with excellent enantioselectivities and high diastereoselectivities. A scale-up
reaction also revealed the same high degree of stereoselectivity.
An investigation of influence factors on asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of
α,β-unsaturated ketones catalyzed by Rh along with surfactant-type ligand was
developed by Li and co-workers [42]. To investigate the impact of the length of the
aliphatic substrates on the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, the researchers in
this work conducted experiments at 5 ∘C utilizing L1 as the ligand and various liner
aliphatic ketones as the substrates, and the highest ee of 93% was obtained when the
alkyl chain had nine carbons (Scheme 9.20). Up to that point, the ee value increased
as the alkyl chain’s length increased.

which could then be recycled up to six times without losing its activity.
A chemoselective, DNA-supported nickel nanoparticle-catalyzed hydrogenation
of nitroarene was developed by Niakan and Asadi [44]. This sustainable method
involved the hydrogenation of diversely substituted nitroarenes at room tempera￾ture in water using sodium borohydride as the hydride source. This heterogeneous
procedure allowed the recycling and reuse of the catalyst for multiple reactions.
The reaction efficiency was not significantly affected by the steric nature of the
substrates.
9.3.6 Platinum-Catalyzed Reduction
Li and coworkers used an effective 3 wt% Pt/SiC-C catalyst (Pt catalyst supported on
SiC-C composite) for the reduction of furfural, utilizing water as the solvent at room
temperature (Scheme 9.22) [45]. At 25 ∘C and 1 MPa hydrogen, the catalyst provided
full furfural conversion with more than 99% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol. The good
recyclability of the catalyst was demonstrated when the right solvent was employed
for washing the spent catalyst.9.3 Reduction Reactions in Water 191

The catalyst was recovered and reused up to 10 cycles.
9.3.7 Iron-Catalyzed Reduction
A phosphine-free, iron-catalyzed hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and carbonatesto
formate was reported [47]. Here, a bifunctional cyclopentadienone-iron tricarbonyl
complex was employed as the catalyst. A base was needed for the hydrogenation of
CO2, and triethanolamine turned out to be the most suitable one. A combination of
CO2 and H2 was used to perform the reduction in an aqueous solution for 20 hours
at 100 ∘C.
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrite was designed by Bren and coworkers [48].

Cobalt nanocluster-catalyzed hydrogenation of aromatic ketones and aldehy￾des in water was developed by Fu and coworkers [49]. This reaction employed
Co/ZrLa0.2Ox as the catalyst at 40 ∘C under 2 MPa of H2. Furfural was hydrogenated
in 10 hours, with a maximum yield of 95% (Scheme 9.24). Throughout the recy￾cling experiments, the catalyst stayed stable and displayed minimal deactivation.
Acetophenone and benzaldehyde were also examined as substrates and thus proved
the efficiency of the catalyst.192 9 Oxidation and Reduction Reactions in Water

applied to diversely substituted nitroarenes with electron-deficient and electron￾rich functional groups at various ring positions.
9.3.9 Copper-Catalyzed Reduction
Arsalani and coworkers mentioned a procedure for the reduction of 2- and
4-nitroanilines to the corresponding diamines through copper ferrite nanoparticle
catalysis [51]. This heterogeneous process used NaBH4 as the reducing agent
and the reaction was carried out at room temperature (Scheme 9.25). With no
appreciable loss of activity, the catalyst was recovered using magnetic separation
and utilized up to six cycles. This eco-friendly and cost-effective reaction was
performed with water as the solvent.

carbon asthe catalyst (Scheme 9.26) [52]. The catalyst was able to attain an astound￾ing 91.7% selectivity toward cinnamyl alcohol.
Chen and coworkers used Ni–Co alloy supported on ZrO2 as a catalyst for the
reduction of phenol to cyclohexanol in water [53]. The results showed that the cat￾alyst exhibited good hydrothermal stability, with a phenol conversion of 96.5%. The
current catalyst has potential in comparison to earlier ones since it needs a shorter
time and less catalyst-reactant ratios to achieve high conversion rates.9.4 Summary and Conclusions 193

9.4 Summary and Conclusions
Oxidation reactions in water have developed in the last few years with respect to
environment-friendly oxidants in aqueous media, and utilizing photocatalytic and
metal-free conditions in the absence of any organic solvents. Even though low-cost
and earth abundant 3d transition metal-catalyzed epoxidations are widely studied,
efficient catalytic systems in water are not largely explored and are anticipated.
In the case of the catalytic oxidation of alcohols, novel methods utilizing metal-free,
organocatalytic, and photocatalytic dehydrogenative oxidations presented sus￾tainable alternatives to traditional catalytic systems. The use of nanoparticles as
efficient catalysts, with the benefits of catalyst recovery and reusability, is receiving
increasing attention. We anticipate the development of novel protocols for efficient
and selective oxidation of different functionalities in aqueous media in the future.
Reduction reactions discussed above encompass the hydrogenation of diverse
compounds such as aldehydes, ketones, quinolines, furfurals, olefins, nitroarenes194 9 Oxidation and Reduction Reactions in Water
etc. in water using different reductants. Catalysts such as iridium, ruthenium,
rhodium, palladium, nickel, and so on are employed. Low catalyst loading, wide
functional group tolerance, mild and green reaction conditions are some of the
features of these reactions. The reusability of the catalyst is evident in majority of
the reactions. Most of the reducing agents, like hydrogen, formic acid, glucose,
sodium formate, and NaBH4 underwent reaction, producing moderate to excellent
yields of the desired products. The results obtained are frequently on par with, and
occasionally even better than, those produced in conventional organic solvents in
terms of yields and selectivities. Furthermore, using waterin place of typical organic
solvents ought to have a positive impact on the environment and human health.

10.1 Introduction
Chemists have embarked on a prolonged quest to discover environmentally friendly
reaction media that can facilitate organic synthetic transformations. This pursuit
alignsseamlessly with the inevitable trajectory of green chemistry, marking a crucial
trend that is expected to shape the future of chemical research and innovation [1].
Water, being a naturally abundant and eco-friendly reaction medium, stands out
for its affordability, safety, and non-flammability, garnering substantial attention
in contrast to traditional organic solvents. The adoption of water as a solvent holds
immense potential for environmental benefits when utilized judiciously. This aligns
seamlessly with the principles of “green chemistry,” offering a pathway to effec￾tively curtail waste production in chemical processes [2]. Considering the potential
rewards of water as a green solvent, chemists face great challenge of developing new
organic transformations that tolerate well in water [3]. In recent years, the field of
radicalreactionsin water has grown steadily, which is mainly attributed to the bloom
of new catalytic systems and newly developed precursors. Here, water plays a vital
role in a favorable promotion in the reaction rate and reaction outcome. However, an
overview to emphasize the recent advantages ofradicalreaction in wateris extremely
rare. In this chapter, our primary focuslies on synthetic transformationsthat involve
radical intermediates in water. It is important to note that we specifically exclude
those reactions conducted in mixed solutions of organic solvents and water.In recent
decades, radical reactions have garnered significant attention from chemists owing
to their substantial synthetic potential [4]. These highly reactive radical species
could be integrated with diverse catalytic systems such as transition metal catalysis,
photoredox chemistry, and electrosynthesis, providing a robust synthetic toolkit to
access complex molecules that are otherwise difficult to achieve by classical ionic

reactions. Water isfrequently chosen as an idealsolvent in radicalreactions, primar￾ily because a significant number of organic radicals exhibitstability in aqueous envi￾ronments [5]. Furthermore, significant efforts have been dedicated to developing an
extensive toolbox of catalysts and reagents to facilitate efficient and selective radical
reactions in water. In this section, we aim to summarize the recent advances in
radical reactions in water, categorizing them according to different catalytic modes.

in Water
10.2.1 Transition Metal-Catalyzed Oxidation
In 2017, Liu developed a copper-catalyzed ligand-free oxidation of the benzylic sp3
C—H bond in the presence of 70% tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) using water as
a solvent (Scheme 10.1a) [6a].

With this green system, a wide range of diarylmethanes and secondary alcohols 1
were oxidized efficiently to afford the desired products 2 with a good yield. And the
group of Gao reported manganese-catalyzed oxidation of a CH2 group adjacent to
a pyridine moiety 3 utilizing TBHP as the oxidant in water (Scheme 10.1b) [6b]. In
both examples, the TBHP radical is formed through single electron transfer (SET)
to cleave the benzylic C—H bond, leading to the subsequent formation of the key
benzylic intermediate 1-I or 3-I. The Zhao group described a direct oxidative amida￾tion between methylarenes and free amines by employing TBHP as an oxidant with
co-catalysis of TBAI and FeCl3 in water[7]. The substrate scope was quite broad, and
the corresponding coupling product could be obtained in moderate to good yield. In
addition to that, cobalt-catalyzed C—H activation and peroxidation of 2-oxindoles 5
in water were also reported by Cheng and coworkers (Scheme 10.2) [8]. They pro￾posed that the oxindole radical 5-I was formed through cobalt-catalyzed homolytic
decomposition of peroxides, and then coupled with the longer-lived peroxyl radical,
the final product 6 could be obtained with good to excellent yields.
In 2011, Taniguchi et al. developed a mild oxyarylation of alkenes 7 by oxida￾tive radical addition in the presence of FeIII (Scheme 10.3) [9]. The reaction was10.2 Transition Metal-Catalyzed Radical Reaction in Water 199

conducted well in water at room temperature due to the hydrophobic effect. The
authors proposed that phenylhydrazylradical 8-I isformed via SET between phenyl￾hydrazine 8 and an iron catalyst. After undergoing twice oxidation by O2, the radical
8-I is converted to a phenyl radical. Subsequent addition to alkenes and coupling of
radical intermediate 7-I with O2 gave peroxyl radical 7-II. Finally, the redox reaction
between the radical 7-II or hydrogen peroxide radical, and the FeII species leads to
peroxides and regeneration of the FeIII species. By simple workup, a wide variety of
alcohols 9 could be obtained in moderate to good yields.
10.2.2 Transition Metal-Catalyzed Fluorination
Recently, researchers have successfully combined “untamed” fluorine and “mild”
waterin chemicalreactions, thus opening up new prospectsfor green fluorine chem￾istry [10]. For example, Lipshutz and coworkers studied the reaction of arylacry￾lamide 10 with Langlois’ reagent (CF3SO2Na) in water (Scheme 10.4) [11].

Scheme 10.4 Copper(II)-catalyzed trifluoromethylation of N-aryl acrylamides in water.
They found the combination of CF3SO2Na and TBHP could effectively generate
trifluoromethyl radicals in the presence of catalytic Cu(NO3)2. Langlois’ reagent
could also be applied forregioselectiveC—H trifluoromethylation of imidazohetero￾cycles 12. Thisreaction proceeded in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu(OAc)2
in a recyclable mixed medium of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrafluoroborate
([Bmim]BF4) and water (Scheme 10.5a) [12a]. Subsequently, Zhang developed
nickel(II)-catalyzed site-selective C—H bond trifluoromethylation of arylamine 14
in water by the utilization of picolinamide as a directing group (Scheme 10.5b) [12b].
Difluoromethylene and trifluoromethylthio groups are two highly valuable
fluorinated moieties that have been used to modify the property of a molecule
[13]. In 2020, Li et al. developed a silver-catalyzed decarboxylative allylation of
α,α-difluoroarylacetic acids 16 with allyl sulfones 17 in water (Scheme 10.6) [14].
Various aryl difluoroacetic acids 16 could react with allylsulfone 17 to afford the
desired products 18 in moderate to good yields. The mechanism demonstrated that
difluoroalkyl radical 16-I was formed through the Ag-catalyzed SET process. And
Silver-catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylthiolation of secondary and tertiary
carboxylic acids 19 in water was also reported (Scheme 10.7) [15].10.2 Transition Metal-Catalyzed Radical Reaction in Water 201

10.2.3 Transition Metal-Catalyzed Difunctionalization of Alkenes
Recently, an indium-mediated radical iodoperfluorobutylation of but-3-yn-1-ol in
water was reported by Takagi and Kanamori [16]. A mechanistic study demon￾strated that Rf radical was formed by spontaneous ET from In metal to RfI. In 2002,
the Oshima group discovered that water plays a considerably important role in
the Pd(0)-catalyzed Kharasch reaction of alkenes and alkynes [17]. Moreover, the
reaction of alkenes with n-C6F13I afforded better yields than those with BrCCl3.
Besides that, Bao developed copper-catalyzed radical oxyazidation and diazidation
in water (Scheme 10.8) [18]. A wide range of styrenes, 1,3-dienes, and unactivated
alkenes 22 were well tolerated.202 10 Radical Reactions in Water

Methyl sulfones 26, as important synthetic targets, have been prepared by Wang
and coworkers from sulfonyl hydrazides using TBHP as the radical initiator and
water as solvent in the presence of Cu(OAc)2 (Scheme 10.9) [19]. Substrates
examined in this study were highly converted, regardless of whether they are
aryl-substituted sulfonyl hydrazide or alkyl-substituted one. A facile and efficient
synthesis of α-naphthols, binaphthols, and anthracenol through Ag(I)-catalyzed
C(sp3)–H/C(sp)–H and C(sp2)–H/C(sp)–H functionalization of β-ketoesters and
alkynes in water was developed [20]. The reaction exhibited high regioselectivity
and environmental benignancy.

10.3 Transition Metal-Free Radical Reaction in Water
Over the past decades, there has been a rapid and significant development in transi￾tion metal-free radical reactions conducted in water. Under the well-defined condi￾tion, various radicals could be generated by the addition of stoichiometric amounts
of initiator [21]. In response to this, numerous methods have been devised employ￾ing different kinds of conditions and reagents. In this section, we mainly describe
recent advances in metal-free radical reactions in water based on the different oxi￾dant systems.
10.3.1 Azo-Type Initiators
In 1998, Oshima reported the atom-transfer radical cyclization of N-allyl-2-
iodoacetamide 29 using a water-soluble azo initiator in water (Scheme 10.10)
[22, 23]. This innovative approach resulted in the synthesis of the desired γ-lactam
derivatives 30 with a good yield. Of note, this reaction could be extended to the
intermolecular radical cyclization of 2-iodoacetamide or 2-iodoacetic acid 31 with

yields. In this transformation, iodide was liberated via ionic lactonization. Hence,
the radical-ionic tandem reaction of 2-chloroacetamide 34 proceeds very smoothly
by adding catalytic amount of sodium iodide. Kita and coworkers developed a novel
intramolecular radical cyclization for a wide range of hydrophobic substrates in
water [24]. In 2003, Murphy and coworkers reported a simple and highly efficient
radical reaction for the preparation of indolones and found that the best condition
entailed the use of the reagent diethylphosphine oxide and radical initiator 35 in
water with no need of additional additives (Scheme 10.11) [25].

[26]. This strategy proves versatile for constructing consecutive C—C/C—I bond,
exhibiting high functional group tolerance. In addition, radical deoxygenation of
alcohols and formation of carbon–carbon bonds in water were achieved by the Jang
group (Scheme 10.12) [27]. In this case, additional additives,such assurfactants, are

not necessary. By employing water-soluble initiators 38 and surfactant-type radical
chain carriers TAPH, deoxygenation of alcohols and radical addition reactions could
proceed smoothly.
This kind of water-soluble initiator could also be used for C—S bond forma￾tion. Kita developed a general intermolecular radical reaction for the synthesis of
thioestersin water using a radical initiator and the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethy￾lammonium bromide CTAB (Scheme 10.13) [28, 29]. A wide range of disulfides
were investigated and pentafluorodiphenyl sulfide gave the best yield.

10.3.2 Triethylborane as Initiator
In 2000, Oshima and coworkers reported the radical cyclization of N-allyl-2-iodo
amide [30]. This reaction exhibited excellent performance in water, affording
the corresponding γ-lactam adducts in good yield. They also accomplished the
radical cyclization of iodo acetals and iodoacetates in water [31]. It was found
that the conversion is significantly higher in water for the radical cyclization
of allyl iodoacetate than that in nonpolar solvents such as benzene and hexane
(Table 10.1). Interestingly, water as a reaction solvent also promoted the cyclization
reaction of large-membered rings. Subsequently, Renaud and coworker developed
tandem radical annulation-azidation of iodomalonate with 1-octene [32]. This
process involved radical addition, successive cyclization, and azidation, and gave
the desired tertiary azide with a good yield. Oshima reported the intermolecular
addition of halogenated compounds to carbon–carbon multiple bonds [33, 34].
10.3.3 Persulfate Salts as Oxidants
Persulfate salts are stable and non toxic, and easy to handle which have been
extensively involved in a wide array of organic transformations. In 2017, Natarajan
et al. developed an intramolecular oxidative radical cyclization of N-substituted 2-
aminobiaryls 50 in water (Scheme 10.14) [35]. A wide range of substituted
2-aminobiaryls were all compatible with this transformation to give the desired206 10 Radical Reactions in Water

radical cyclization of enynes/dienes with alcohols in water was developed [36].
Recently, Xu and coworkers utilized Na2S2O8 as the green oxidant to develop an
efficient and practical protocol to synthesize isothiocyanates 54 from amines and
carbon disulfide with water as a solvent (Scheme 10.15) [37]. This protocol can
proceed smoothly through either a stepwise or one-pot procedure under the basic
conditions, giving the desired isothiocyanates 54 in good yields. A wide range of
linear and branched alkyl amines and aryl amines 52 were readily converted by
these two procedures. Moreover, chiral isothiocyanates can also be synthesized

by chiral amines following the one-pot procedure in water. The mechanism study
demonstrated that carbamothionyl radical 53-II was involved.
The use of inexpensive K2S2O8 in water for the synthesis and functionalization
of heterocycles from arylglyoxylic acid was well reported by the group of Laha
(Scheme 10.16) [38]. This transformation is very innovative because glucose was
used as a K2S2O8 activator, facilitating the reaction to occur at room temperature.
Under the optimized condition, a series of heterocycles like pyrrole, benzothia￾zole, thiophene, and indole etc. could all be acylated smoothly. Also, the tandem
reactions of various ortho-substituted anilines 58 with aryl glyoxylates 55 were
achieved. Sharma and coworkers presented K2S2O8-glucose-mediated oxidative
coupling for the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) from simple indoles
and alcohols in water [39]. The key step of this reaction is to oxidize alcohols to
carbonyl compounds by in situ generating radicals from K2S2O8. Most recently,
functionalized 3-(S)-arylthioindoles were synthesized from indoles and aryl thiols
in good to excellent yields by utilizing the K2S2O8-glucose system in water [40].

10.3.4 Peroxides as Oxidants
Recently, organic chemists combined a catalytic amount of I2 with TBHP to
develop several interesting radical cyclization reactions. For example, Liang and
coworkers utilized the I2/TBHP catalytic oxidation system to achieve a one-pot
radical cyclization reaction of 1,6-enynes 60 with sulfonyl hydrazides in water
(Scheme 10.17) [41]. This reaction proceeded smoothly, giving the five-membered
or six-membered sulfonylated products 61 or 62 with good yields. Two types of
cyclization products were formed due to the control of the steric effect. Afterwards,
cyclization/hydrolysis of 1,5-enenitriles with sulfonyl hydrazides has been estab￾lished for the preparation of valuable pyrrolidine-2,4-diones [42]. In the presence208 10 Radical Reactions in Water

of I2/TBHP system with water as a solvent, sulfonyl hydrazides could generate
sulfonyl radicals, which underwent radical addition, intramolecular cyclization,
hydrogen abstraction, and hydrolysis to afford the final products.
In 2022, Wei and coworkers developed three types of radical cyclization based
on 1,6-enynes 63 to afford five-membered and six-membered cyclic lactams 64–66
(Scheme 10.18) [43]. This protocol showed noteworthy features such as mild reac￾tion conditions and the employment of water as a reaction medium. In addition,
radical C(sp3)-H functionalization triggered cyclization of olefinic 1,3-dicarbonyls
and olefinic amides was also developed [44].

C(sp3)–H functionalization of inert alkanes was also accomplished, allowing for
accessto various benzimidazo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-6(5H)-ones 69 (Scheme 10.19)[45].
Notably, using di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) as the oxidant and sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) asthe phase transfer agent in a water-based medium proved highly effi￾cient for this conversion. Moreover, a wide range of cyclic alkanes, long-chain alka￾nes, toluene derivatives could be compatible, and demonstrating a broad substrate
scope. Remarkably, this methodology could be extended forthe radical cyclization of
unactivated alkanes with alkene-substituted quinazolinones, showcasing the great
potential of the C(sp3)–H functionalization strategy employing DTBP in water [46].10.3 Transition Metal-Free Radical Reaction in Water 209

In 2018, Wei et al. developed a new method for the C(sp3)–H hydroxylation of
2-oxindoles 70 via a radical cross-coupling reaction exposed to air in water, affording
various 3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles 71 in good yields (Scheme 10.20) [47]. In this reac￾tion, t-BuOOH was used as a hydroxylation reagent, and the reaction was promoted
by the addition of SDS as a surfactant. Additionally, a temperature-controlled sul￾fonylation of DTBP in water was also reported by the Yuan group, which was used
for the formation of diverse aryl methyl sulfones and β-hydroxysulfones [48].

Recently, Wang and coworkers discovered the oxidative radical addition of
arylhydrazines with α-aryl vinyl azides in the presence of H2O2 as the oxidant
and PEG-800 as the phase-transfer catalyst [49]. This reaction took place in
water, providing various 2-arylacetophenones under conditions compatible with
various functional groups. Liu and coworkersreported the ionic liquid promoted

Recently, the combination of MI-TBHP as an oxidation system (M=Na, K, and
NH4) in aqueous media has emerged as a promising avenue fortransition-metal-free
oxidative transformations [51]. In 2015, Li and coworkers developed I−/TBHP cat￾alyzed oxidative amination with benzophenone imine in water [52]. A series of
substituted benzaldehydes furnished the corresponding amides successfully. After￾wards, oxidative cross-coupling of C(sp3)—H bonds adjacent to nitrogen with alkyl
O—H and N—H bonds was reported by the Punniyamurthy group (Scheme 10.22)
[53]. Under the optimal conditions, a wide range of functionalized oxazolidines and
imidazolidines 76 were obtained with good yield.

10.3.5 O2 as the Oxidant
Given that O2 is both inexpensive and environmentally benign. For example, dioxy￾gen radical initiation hasrecently been successfully applied forthe hydrosilylation of
alkynes 77 in water, leading to high yields of hydrosilylated alkene products 78 with
excellent Z:E stereoselective ratios (Scheme 10.23) [54]. Thus, a tentative mecha￾nism for this process was suggested. The dioxygen initiation triggers radical events,
where (Me3Si)3Si• radical derived from the (Me3Si)3SiH adds to the C—C triple
bond. Then, this radical 77-I abstracts a hydrogen atom from (Me3Si)3SiH to give10.3 Transition Metal-Free Radical Reaction in Water 211

the final product 78 with regeneration of (Me3Si)3Si• radical to propagate a radical
chain. The Chatgilialoglu group examined different initiation methods for hydrosi￾lylation and indeed found that dioxygen initiation exhibited superior performance
for the hydrosilylation reaction of C—C multiple bonds compared to that of C—C
double bonds[55]. Besidesthat,(Me3Si)3Si• radical is also used to generate alkylrad￾icals. The Postigo group developed the (Me3Si)3SiH-mediated intermolecular addi￾tion of perfluoroalkyl radicals to electron-rich or -poor alkenes in water [56]. In this
transformation, the azo compound is found to be a more efficient radical initiator
than dioxygen.
Recently, Baruah and coworkers utilized O2 as the oxidant to develop
three-component reactions for the synthesis of 1,3-oxazines (Scheme 10.24)
[57]. This reaction proceeded very smoothly in water, enabling the assembly of
naphthol 79, aldehyde 81 and tetrahydroisoquinoline 80 into 1,3-oxazines 82 with
moderate to good yield.

in Water
Visible light photoredox reactions have been esteemed as green chemistry tools for
various organic transformations [62]. However, visible-light catalytic reactions in10.4 Photoredox Reactions Excited by Visible Light in Water 213
water have historically received little attention due to the poor solubility of most
organic substrates and catalysts. In the recent decades, merging the inherently green
properties of visible light catalysis with the use of water as a solvent has experienced
a significant boost in order to diminish the environmental impact of photocatalytic
processes [63]. In this section, we will present the recent advances in visible light
catalytic reactions in water and emphasize their potential advantages according to
the different synthetic transformations.
10.4.1 Radical Addition to 𝛂,𝛃-Unsaturated Systems
In 2012, Postigo and coworkersreported light-induced iodoperfluoroalkylation reac￾tions of alkenes and alkynes in water [64]. Recently, Lei and coworkers developed
a visible light-induced radical addition to alkynes 91 in water for the direct synthe￾sis of Z-alkenylphosphine oxides 93 (Scheme 10.28) [65]. A wide range of terminal
and internal alkynes 91 were well tolerated, affording the products 93 with high Z
stereoselectivity. The mechanism study demonstrated that high Z-selectivity came
from π–π stacking interaction between the aromatic rings of the aryl acetylene and
diphenylphosphine oxide.

Besides, a visible light-driven hydroacylation and epoxyacylation of olefins 94 or
97 in water have been presented (Scheme 10.29) [66]. The Salles et al. found that
optimum reaction conditions consist of the use of methylene blue as a photoredox
catalyst, persulfate as an oxidant, and potassium carbonate as a base in water as a
solvent in the presence of visible light. Moreover, these two transformations could
be accomplished using only one set of reagents. Under the optimized condition, this
reaction performed very well for aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes as well as conju￾gated and nonconjugated olefins, affording the ketones 98 and epoxyketones 96 in
excellent yields. Furthermore, the reaction was carried out on a gram scale with no
loss of reactivity.214 10 Radical Reactions in Water

More recently, Xu and coworkers showed water could have a key role in pro￾mote iremote 1,5-trifluoromethylthio-sulfonylation of vinylcyclopropane 99 with
ArSO2SCF3 reagents 100 (Scheme 10.30) [67]. Moreover, SDS was also necessary to
increase the solubility of organic substrates in water. This green and mild approach
allowed a wide range of aryl vinylcyclopropane and alkyl vinylcyclopropane to be
available in this transformation. According to the reaction mechanism, the reaction
was initiated by a SET process between eosin Y* and ArSO2SCF3 100 to generate
sulfonyl radicals and the eosin Y/SCF3 complex. Then, arylsulfonyl radical was
added to vinylcyclopropane 99, followed by a rearrangement of cyclopropane to
form intermediate 99-I, which sequentially reacted with the eosin Y/SCF3 complex
to furnish the corresponding product 101.

Recently, Niu and coworkers reported a visible light-induced Meerwein hydra￾tion reaction of alkenes 111 in water using mpg-C3N4 as a recyclabe photocatalyst
(Scheme 10.33) [70]. A wide range of diazonium salts 110 and alkenes 111 with dif￾ferent functional groups were all compatible in this transformation, furnishing the

water (Scheme 10.34) [71]. By employing water as a reaction medium, a wide range

By employing this photocatalyst, N-phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline 116 with vari￾ous substituents and various ketones 119 were all compatible with this reaction
(Scheme 10.35) [74]. This catalyst was synthesized through ultrasound-assisted
self-assembly among the anionic rose bengal dye, negatively charged Fe3O4 NPs,
and positively charged MgAl-LDH. Under the optimal conditions, this reaction
with nitroalkanes proceeded very smoothly in water to give the corresponding
products 122 in moderate to good yields. In addition to this, Wu and coworkers
successfully employed in situ-generated photosensitizer derived from a catalytic
amount of CoCl2 with dmgH (dimethylglyoxime) as a ligand for the development
of the cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction of N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines
116 and indoles 123 (Scheme 10.35) [75].
10.5 Conclusions
In conclusion, this chapter provides a comprehensive summary of radical reactions
in water using traditional and modern radical methods. Simultaneously, the oppor￾tunities and the challenges of utilizing water as a solvent have been highlighted. And
the related mechanisms are also described in detail to guide further developmentsin
radical reactions. In the past few years, a growing number of new reactions accom￾modated to water have appeared, opening a new prospect for green chemistry. They
feature several advantages, such as mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope,
and simple operation.
Despite these advantages, significant improvement is still necessary. For example,
addressing challenges related to the reuse of aqueous systems and the treatment
of waste water is crucial. Moreover, asymmetric catalysis in this field still requires
further development. For example, more environmentally friendly strategies need
to be explored, especially in areas such as photoredox chemistry, electrosynthesis,
and photobiocatalytic transformations. In addition, the development of new
water-soluble mediators to broaden the scope of reaction types is also necessary.
With the increasing interest in green chemistry, the pursuit of developing milder
and more sustainable processes for the synthesis of natural products and complex
molecules has never stopped. We hope this chapter inspires more chemists to
explore more novel, relevant strategies.

11.1 Introduction
Scientists have embarked on a persistent exploration to identify environmentally
sustainable reaction media that can facilitate organic synthetic transformations.
This endeavor harmoniously aligns with the inexorable progression of green
chemistry, representing a pivotal trend expected to significantly influence the
future of chemical research and innovation [1]. Water, as a naturally abundant and
environmentally friendly reaction medium, distinguishes itself with qualities such
as affordability, safety, and nonflammability, attracting considerable attention in
contrast to traditional organic solvents[2]. Despite the potential advantages of water
as a green solvent, chemists are faced with the formidable challenge of developing
new organic transformationsthat thrive in water [3]. In recent years, the field of car￾bene reactions in water has experienced steady growth, propelled by the emergence
of new catalytic systems and innovative precursors. Water assumes a crucial role
in enhancing reaction rates and outcomes favorably. However, a comprehensive
overview highlighting recent advancements in carbene reactions in water remains
notably scarce. This chapter primarily delves into synthetic transformations involv￾ing carbene intermediates in water. It is important to emphasize that we specifically
exclude reactions conducted in mixed solutions of organic solvents and water.
11.2 Carbene Reaction in Water
Water, as an environmentally friendly green solvent, possesses numerous attractive
physicochemical properties. Over the past decades, water-promoted approaches in
carbene chemistry have gained significant attention [4]. With the increasing num￾ber of studies on carbene reactions with water as co-solvent or additive, one recent

review has systematically summarized the recent developments in this emerging
field [4]. Hence, in this chapter, we mainly focus on the chemistry of carbene reac￾tionsin pure water and simultaneously highlight the most important breakthroughs
in this field, providing a comprehensive guide forreaction design.In this chapter, the
organization of reactions is based on the different reaction types, and the last part
deals with organocatalytic N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) reactions in water.
11.2.1 Cyclopropanation and Cyclopropenization
The cyclopropanation of diazo compounds with alkenes is a general and power￾ful protocol for the synthesis of three-membered carbocycles [5]. For example,
Carreira and coworker reported iron-catalyzed cyclopropanation with trifluoroethy￾lamine hydrochloride 1 and olefins 2 in the presence of sodium nitrite in water
(Scheme 11.1) [6]. When commercially available tetraphenylporphyriniron(III)
complex Fe(TPP)Cl was employed as the catalyst, the cyclopropanation of styrene
derivatives took place via in situ diazotation, affording chemo- and stereose￾lectively trans-cyclopropanes 3 in high yield. Later, the same group extended
this methodology to dienes and enynes [7]. The reaction of trifluoroethylamine
hydrochloride with 1-arylbuta-1,3-dienes or 1-aryl-but-3-ene-1-ynes in water gave
the trifluoromethyl-substituted vinyl- and alkynylcyclopropanes in good yields with
complete trans selectivity.

In a similar manner, glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride was also used as carbene
precursor for the conversion of styrene into trans-arylcyclopropanecarboxylic
acid esters [8]. The reaction was carried out in the presence of Fe(TPP)Cl as a
catalyst, providing good yields and excellent diastereoselectivity of target products.
In addition, cyclopropanation of styrenes, dienes, and enynes by in situ formed
diazomethane was achieved by Carreira (Scheme 11.2) [9]. In 2008, Simonneaux

and coworkers developed asymmetric cyclopropanation of styrenes with ethyldia￾zoacetate in water catalyzed by a water-soluble para-tetrasulfonated Halterman
porphyriniron complex [10].
In 2010, Carreira and coworker disclosed rhodium-catalyzed cyclopropena￾tion of trifluoroethylamine hydrochloride 7 with alkynes 8 in water medium
(Scheme 11.3) [11]. In this transformation, trifluoroethylamine hydrochloride 7
was converted into the reactive diazoalkane in the presence of H2SO4 and NaNO2,
ultimately leading to a series of trifluoromethyl-substituted cyclopropenes 9 in
67–78% yields. Crucial to the success of this transformation was compatibility of
rhodium catalyst [Rh2(esp)2] under the harsh condition.

Subsequently, visible light-promoted cyclopropenizations of N-tosylhydrazones

of the mechanism was the formation of key singlet carbene species under blue
light irradiation. Furthermore, this protocol was also applied for X—H insertion
reactions (X=N, S) and cyclopropanations.

In 2006, Afonso and coworkers reported Rh(II)-catalyzed intramolecular C—H
insertion of α-diazocarbonyl compounds 13 in water (Scheme 11.5) [13]. The study
provided evidence that the selectivity of the C—H insertion relied on the structure

of the catalyst and the hydrophobic nature of the amide substituents. Recently,
Pérez and coworkers discovered a silver catalyst for the intermolecular insertion of
carbene into alkane C—H bonds in water [14].
Sivasankar and coworker achieved an iridium-catalyzed acceptor/acceptor car￾bene insertion into N—H bonds of various anilines 17 (Scheme 11.6) [15]. Various
α-amino diesters 16 could be obtained in good-to-excellent yields employing water
as the solvent. And noncationic [(COD)IrCl]2 was found to be an effective catalyst
for carbene insertion of these less-reactive acceptor/acceptor precursors.

In addition, difluoromethylation of alcohols 20 using TMSCF2Br as the diflu￾orocarbene reagent and KHF2 as a mild activator in water was accomplished by
Hu and coworkers (Scheme 11.7) [16]. This reaction with primary, secondary,
and tertiary alcohols 20 performed very well, affording various difluoromethyl
ethers 21 in moderate-to-good yields. In 2007, Wang and coworker demonstrated
[2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfonium ylides generated from Rh(II) carbene
and sulfides in water [17].

11.2.3 Organocatalytic NHC Reactions
NHCs are not only used as ligands in the catalysis and organometallic chem￾istry but as powerful neutral nucleophiles to react with diverse electrophiles.
In 2010, García-Tellado and coworkers developed a three-component protocol
for the C2-functionalization of N-alkylated imidazoles in water (Scheme 11.8)
[18]. The optimal order of addition was determined to be alkynoate 23, followed

by N-alkylated imidazole 22 and aldehyde 24, which was identified to be most
optimal. The reaction underwent carbene–aldehyde addition, alkoxide–alkynoate
addition, and protonation and hydrolysis to afford the desired products 25 with
moderate-to-good yields.
Later, Chen and coworkers reported silver-promoted intramolecular addition
reaction between NHC and unsaturated esters in water (Scheme 11.9) [19]. A
wide range of 1H-imidazo[1,2-a]indole derivatives 27 could be obtained with
moderate-to-excellent yields.

In 2018, Zhong and coworkers developed a chiral NHC-catalyzed benzoin con￾densation reaction in water (Scheme 11.10) [20]. A reasonable reaction mechanism
involved the formation of an enol-type Breslow intermediate followed by addition of
another benzaldehyde and a 1,4-H shift process with water as the proton shuttle.

non-activated aniline-type amines 31 was investigated by Bae group to access
β-aminosulfonyl fluorides 32 (Scheme 11.11) [22]. The NMR analyses revealed
NHC-activated amines 238 into a nucleophilic amine species.
Chi and coworkers demonstrated NHC-catalyzed reactions of enals 33 and enone

Two years later, Snider disclosed a similar procedure using air-stable NHC precat￾alyst and NaOH asthe base,resulting in the synthesis of 1,3,4-triphenylcyclopentene
[24]. Afterwards, Ganesan and coworkers found that the reaction of isatins 37 with
enals 38 as the electrophiles performed well in water medium with NaCl as an addi￾tive (Scheme 11.13) [25]. Numerous experiments demonstrated the use of brine as
reaction medium greatly increased the reaction rate by hydrophobic hydration. This
methodology could be further extended to synthesis of a variety of heterocycles and
carbocycles.

12.1 Introduction
As the global economy continues to burgeon, the spotlight on environmental issues
has intensified. This has sparked considerable interest in utilizing water-based pro￾tocols for synthetic chemistry. Water emerges as a prime candidate in an organic
chemist’ssolvent kit, not only due to its widespread availability but also because of its
exceptional environmental credentials. It is inexpensive, nontoxic, nonflammable,
highly stable, and easy to handle, making it an inherently quintessential “green”
solvent choice. Both heterogeneous “on-water” and homogeneous “in-water” reac￾tions and micellar catalysis driven by the hydrophobic effect have been successfully
developed, showcasing the versatility of water as a solvent.
Recent advancements in nucleophilic addition and substitution reactions condu￾cted in water have revolutionized the field of organic synthesis. These developments
have been driven by the increasing demand for sustainable and environmentally
friendly synthetic methodologies. The key advancements in this area include the
design of novel catalysts and reaction conditions optimized for aqueous environ￾ments, allowing for the efficient and selective functionalization of a wide range of
substrates. Moreover, innovative strategiessuch as micellar catalysis and flow chem￾istry have further enhanced the efficiency and scalability of nucleophilic reactions
in water, enabling their application in industrial-scale synthesis. Furthermore, these
advancements have not only expanded the synthetic toolbox but also contributed to
the development of biocompatible reactions for applications in medicinal chemistry
and drug discovery. Overall, recent progress in nucleophilic addition and substitu￾tion reactions in water holds immense promise for advancing sustainable chemistry
and addressing environmental challenges in the field of organic synthesis.

12.2 Nucleophilic Addition Reactions
Nucleophilic addition reactions entail the interaction between a compound con￾taining an electrophilic triple or double bond and a nucleophile, resulting in the
cleavage of the bond. Additionally, when nucleophiles are added to triple or double
bonds involving carbon and a heteroatom, diverse types of polar bonds, such as
—C≡N or —C=O, display significant variation in nucleophilic addition reactions.
The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups onto multiple-bonded carbon
atoms reduces the electron density of carbon, thereby facilitating nucleophilic addi￾tion. These reactions are viable in both aqueous-organic and solely organic solvents,
with an increasing emphasis on conducting reactions in-water or water–organic
mixtures. This discussion delves into the realm of nucleophilic addition reactions,
particularly focusing on those executed in-water or water–organic environments.
12.2.1 Knoevenagel Reactions
The Knoevenagelreaction isthe modified version of Aldolreaction. Here,C–Cbonds
are formed by the nucleophilic addition of a compound having active hydrogen to a
ketone or aldehyde by utilizing a basic catalyst [1]. This reaction proceeded in water
media and produced adducts in reasonable yields. The recyclability of catalysts, the
shortreaction time, and the requirement of only low temperature are the main pecu￾liarities of this approach.
Morpholine-catalyzed synthesis of (E)-ethyl 2-cyano compounds in water was
developed by Menegatti and coworkers [2]. This green protocol proceeded with
the Knoevenagel reaction of aryl aldehydes with ethyl cyanoacetate. This approach
rendered the expected products in moderate to excellent yields without the aid of
any organic solvent.
Chang and coworkers achieved an effective green protocol for the synthesis of
novel varieties of Knoevenagel adducts using water asthe solvent(Scheme 12.1a)[3].
Here, the Knoevenagel reaction was successfully carried out between aldehydes or
ketones with activated methylene compounds in the presence of [Nmm-PDO][OAc]
in water at room temperature and delivered the expected products in good to
excellent yields. The activated methylene compounds, like 2-arylacetonitrile,
β-diketone, alkyl cyanoacetate, cyanoacetamide, benzothiazole-2-acetonitrile,
malononitrile, and thiazolidinedione, were found to be tolerated well in the
reaction. However, thiazolidinedione underwent this reaction under a solvent-free
environment at 60 ∘C utilizing the [Nmm-PDO][Gly] catalyst. The product sepa￾ration via simple filtration techniques and the recyclability of the catalyst are the
main benefits of this protocol.
In 2018, Xu and coworkers developed N-methyl piperidine-based ionic liquids
([Nmp-PDO][OAc]) as an efficient recyclable catalyst that can be used for both
the Knoevenagel reaction and the hetero-Michael addition reaction in H2O as the
solvent (Scheme 12.1b,c) [4]. Interestingly, this is the first report on the Michael
addition of α,β-unsaturated amides in H2O using [Nmp-PDO][OAc] as catalyst to12.2 Nucleophilic Addition Reactions 233

afford the corresponding expected products in high yields. Various N-substituted
acrylamides were tolerated well in this protocol. In Knoevenagel condensation,
several α,β-unsaturated, heteroaryl, aryl aldehydes, and aliphatic ketones were
found compatible with the reaction.
Xi and coworkers explored a Knoevenagel condensation reaction of aryl aldehydes
with ethyl cyanoacetate using N-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-DBU bromide ([HyEtDBU]Br)-
H2O-DABCO catalytic system at room temperature [5]. Substituted aryl aldehydes
with electron-rich or electron-deficient groups, furaldehyde, naphthaldehyde, and
anthracene carboxaldehyde were tolerated well in this protocol. The reaction pro￾ceeded at a short reaction time, imparting excellent yields with high catalytic
recyclability.
Recently, Das and coworkers developed a synthetic approach toward electrophilic
olefins from the Knoevenagel condensation reaction [6]. The reaction between
organocyano compounds with carbonyl compounds catalyzed by 20 mol% Mg
powder in water afforded the expected products in good yields (Scheme 12.2). The
versatility of this protocol was demonstrated through the execution of a one-pot
Knoevenagel–Michael reaction and a sequential Knoevenagel reaction followed
by chemoselective reduction in alkenes. These methodologies facilitated the
efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant cyano compounds, highlighting the
protocol’s practical utility in medicinal chemistry applications. The major benefits
of the protocol include a solvent-free process, eco-friendly conditions, together with
a wide substrate scope, and the recyclability of the catalyst.234 12 Nucleophilic Addition and Substitution Reactions In-Water

12.2.2 Michael Addition Reaction
A Michael donor, such as an enolate or other nucleophile, and a Michael acceptor,
typically an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, react to form a Michael adduct
by forming a C–C bond at the β-carbon of the acceptor. This reaction is called
the Michael 1,4-addition or Michael reaction [7]. Recently, chiral surfactant-type,
metal enzyme, lipopeptides, and amino acid-based catalysts have been used in
water-mediated Michael reactions. This protocol was performed in water or a mix￾ture of organic solvent/water media. There are some advantages to this approach,
such as good yield, mild reaction conditions, and good stereoselectivity.
Metallomicelles, novel chiral surfactant-type catalysts, were synthesized utilizing
Schiff-based ligands, and it was developed by Wang and coworkers [8]. This catalyst
showed high catalytic performance in the Michael addition of 2-enoylpyridine
1-oxides and indoles in-water as the solvent. This protocol was found successful for
a wide range of indole and 2-enoylpyridine 1-oxides to the corresponding Michael
adducts with high enantioselectivity and yields. The heterocyclic, polyclic, aryl
ortho-, and meta-substituted 2-enoylpyridine 1-oxides underwent the Michael
reaction smoothly. Also, this methodology was found highly effective for indoles
with electron-donating and halogen substituents, whereas the strategy was entirely
inert in electron-poor indoles.
Wang and coworkers established nitro-bearing pyrrolidines via the enantioselec￾tive Michael addition reaction (Scheme 12.3a) [9]. In this synthetic methodology,
nitroalkanes underwent Michael addition with 2, 3-dioxopyrrolidines in the
presence of 10 mol% Cu(OTf)2, 10 mol% ligand L1, 30 mol% N-ethylmorpholine,
10 mol% SLS in H2O/CHCl3 at 25 ∘C, which provided the desired products in good
yield and diastereoselectivity. N-Aryl and N-alkyl 2,3-dioxopyrrolidines were well
tolerated in this strategy.
In 2022, a novelroute forspirooxindole synthesis via the Michael/hemiketalization
reaction in CHCl3:H2O media was reported by Wang and coworkers [10]. Here,
4-hydroxycoumarins reacted with unsaturated α-ketoesters (derived from isatin)
in the presence of triethylamine, Cu(OTf)2, ligand L2, and SDS in CHCl3: H2O12.2 Nucleophilic Addition Reactions 235

at 5 ∘C and delivered spirooxindoles in excellent yield and enantioselectivity.
Various N-substituted isatin-derived α-ketoesters and 4-hydroxycoumarins bearing
electron-poor and electron-rich substituents performed well in this protocol. The
strategy showed many advantages, including the eco-friendly nature of the reaction,
a wide substrate scope, and high yields of the product (Scheme 12.3b).
Itoh and coworkers synthesized highly lipophilic-substituted 3-decyl-β-proline
and also studied the catalytic activity of this compound in the Michael addition
reaction in aqueous media [11]. This catalyst was found to be efficient when one
equivalent of nitrostyrene was reacted with two equivalents of carbonyl compound
in the presence of a saturated aqueous KCl solution at room temperature for five
hours, which afforded the Michael adducts. Low catalyst loading, mild reaction
conditions, excellent yield, and diastereoselectivity were the main highlights of this
protocol.
Paixão and coworkers developed an N-alkylated lipopeptide and studied its cat￾alytic activity in the Michael addition reaction ofseveral aldehydesto E-nitrostyrene
in aqueous media [12]. The nitroalkenes having alkyl, heterocyclic, and also aryl
substituents with electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties resulted in moderate
to excellent yields of the expected products. The aldehydes like hexanal, isovaler￾aldehyde, and (R)-(+)-citronellal tolerated this strategy. The positive aspects of this
protocol include low catalyst loadings, free of additives, high yield, good recyclability
of catalyst, excellent diastereoselectivity, and enantioselectivity.
Ryu and coworkers developed a novel L-proline-derived organocatalyst, 1-(3,5-Bis
(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-((R)-phenyl((S)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)methyl)urea (PHU) for
asymmetric Michael addition of various nitroolefins and carbonyl compounds [13].
This catalyst was also found efficient for this protocol in the presence of 10 mol%236 12 Nucleophilic Addition and Substitution Reactions In-Water
of PHU and 2.5 mol% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in H2O at 25 ∘C that afforded the
expected products in excellent yield and stereoselectivity. Under these reaction
conditions, various aldehydes, cycloketones, and arylnitroalkenes reacted well. The
significance of this protocol was established by the synthesis of a new histamine
receptor agonist, Sch 50971.
In the Aza-Michael reaction, nitrogen-based nucleophiles react with electron￾deficient C=C bonds (Michael acceptor) to form C–N bonds. Under the influence
of a suitable catalyst, this reaction proceeds efficiently in water media. For example,
Tyagi and coworkers demonstrated the first aza-Michael addition of substituted aryl
and heteroaryl amines to methyl vinyl ketone, catalyzed by α-amylase in H2O [14].
They also synthesized an efficient and reusable catalyst, α-amylase@CuNPs that
was used for this protocol. Additionally, the research team illustrated the synthetic
applicability of a cascade aza-Michael/aldol/aromatization process by producing
biologically relevant 3-acetyl quinoline.
In the thia-Michaelreaction, a variant of Michael addition, a thiol molecule acts as
the Michael donor (nucleophile) and reacts with an electron-poor C=C bond. Here
also, by choosing the appropriate catalyst, the reaction could be performed in water.
Hoven and coworkers devised poly(N-(benzyl acrylamide))-ran-poly(N-(2-
hydroxypropyl)acrylamide) (PBAM-ran-PHPAM) that was utilized for the sulfa￾Michael reaction in H2O as the solvent [15]. This protocol was successfully
achieved by reacting thiol derivatives with various β-nitrostyrenes in the presence
of PBAM26-ran-PHPAM74 micelles at room temperature for 24 hours. Excellent
yields, mild reaction environments, and the reusability of polymeric micelles up to
10 times were the main attractions of this strategy.
12.2.3 Mannich Reaction
The Mannich reaction, often referred to as the amino alkylation reaction, is the con￾densation of an enolizable carbonyl molecule with a 1∘ or 2∘ amine, a non-enolizable
aldehyde, and NH3 to produce an amino carbonyl compound, which is also known as
the Mannich base [16]. This compound plays a major role in the synthesis of natural
products. Recently, metals, anionic surfactants, and acidslike calix[4]arene tetracar￾boxylic acids and polyacrylic acids (PAAs) were used as catalysts in water-mediated
Mannich reactions and provided adducts in reasonable yields.
Mukhopadhyay and coworker reported a calix[4]arene tetracarboxylic acid
(C4A4)-catalyzed one-pot synthetic methodology for the preparation of spiro
[dihydropyridine-oxindoles] utilizing water as the reaction media through a multi￾component Mannich-type reaction [17]. This green protocol proceeds by reacting
anilines, N-substituted isatins, and 1,3-diketones in the presence of a 5 mol% C4A4
catalyst in H2O at 80 ∘C for 12 hours to afford the expected products in high yields.
A range of anilines with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents
underwent the reaction successfully. This catalytic system showed advantages such
as catalyst recyclability, eco-friendliness, and enhanced product yield.
Chakraborti and coworkers established an eco-friendly multicomponent reaction
for the preparation of tetrahydropyridines using sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate12.2 Nucleophilic Addition Reactions 237
(SDOSS) as the anionic surfactant [18]. Substrates like amine, β-ketoester, and
benzaldehyde in the presence of 10 mol% SDOSS in H2O at room temperature for
4–10 hours provided the desired products in good yields. The proposed mecha￾nism suggested that the protocol proceeded via tandem intra- and intermolecular
Mannich-type reaction routes. The strategy showed many advantages, like increased
product yield, short reaction time, eco-friendly process, room temperature reaction,
and needed only simple purification techniques like crystallization to purify the
product.
Gao and coworkers developed a PAA-catalyzed multicomponent Mannich
reaction for the synthesis of β-amino ketones in water media [19]. This protocol
was achieved by reacting substrates such as aldehydes, anilines, and ketones
under optimized conditions [(PAA) (7.5 mol%), H2O, 25 ∘C, 6–12 hours] to afford
the required products in high yields. Aryl amines and aryl aldehydes containing
either electron-rich or electron-deficient substituents were well tolerated in the
reaction. Furthermore, this methodology was also found effective for aliphatic and
heteroaldehydes.
Recently, Naseri and coworkers disclosed the synthesis of two novel catalystssuch
as HybPOM/HPW12 and Go/Fe3O4/HybPOM/HPW12 via the immobilization of het￾eropolyacids supported on polyoxometalate organic–inorganic nanoparticles [20].
At ambient temperature, these recyclable catalysts were found to have good catalytic
activity in one-pot Mannich reactions between aldehydes, ketones, and amine in
water, affording a good yield of β-amino carbonyl compounds (Scheme 12.4).

The piperdin-2-yl-indoles were synthesized via an eco-friendly Mannich reaction
mediated by MsOH and were devised by Lu and coworkers [21]. The desired prod￾ucts have the core skeleton of certain alkaloids. The protocol was carried out between
indoles and aliphatic cyclic imines having no α-substitution, using 100 mol% MsOH
and 30 mol% tetra-n-butylammonium iodide (TBAI) in H2O at 60 ∘C for 18 hours.
5-Fluoroindole, 5-chloroindole, and isoquinoline derived and five-membered imines
are compatible with this protocol, affording reasonable yields.
A wide range of bioactive [22] and naturally occurring compounds [23] have
the isoindolinone framework. The one-pot multicomponent Mannich-type reac￾tions were reported with 1∘-amines, 2-naphthols, and 2-formyl benzoic acids,
affording isoindolinones in moderate to good yields [24]. This catalyst-free strategy
was conducted in water at 120 ∘C. Amines like benzyl amines, 4-phenylbutyl,
1-phenylethyl, and furfuryl amines were compatible with this strategy, whereas
the sterically hindered tert-butylamine did not give the desired products. Besides,238 12 Nucleophilic Addition and Substitution Reactions In-Water
2-naphthol-bearing −CO2Me and Br groups at its sixth position, as well as −CN and
−NO2 substituents at various positions (6-nitro, 4-cyano) on the aryl ring of phtha￾laldehydic acid, were tolerated well. Transition metal-free strategy, eco-friendly
approach, one-pot multicomponent reaction, and water as solvent are the major
features of this protocol.
Zarea and coworkers reported on the novel N-alkylation of indoles in aqueous
microdroplets [25]. The alkylated indoles were formed by a multicomponent
Mannich-type approach in both bulk as well as microdroplet phases. Aldehydes,
indole, and amines underwent the conventional bulk method, which provided
C-alkylated products, whereas a microdroplet Mannich reaction with the same
starting materials offered N-alkylated indoles in moderate yields. The reaction
was found to be highly chemoselective and worked well with functionalized aryl
aldehydes and indoles.
Ye and coworkers devised a highly selective and efficient method for producing
3,4-dihydro-2-quinolones through Cu-catalyzed alkyne hydration followed by
intramolecular Mannich reaction, and this protocol was applied to carbonyl￾ynamides [26]. Moreover, when carbonyl-ynamides underwent Zn-catalyzed aldol
reactions in water, they also afforded 3,4-dihydro-2-quinolones (Scheme 12.5). The
formal synthesis of (±)-martinellic acid demonstrated the synthetic relevance of
this protocol.

12.2.4 Aldol Reaction
The aldol reaction involves the formation of a C–C bond by the reaction of an
aldehyde or ketone having an α-hydrogen in the presence of a base to produce the
corresponding β-hydroxyaldehyde or β-hydroxyketone [27]. This reaction was also
carried out in aqueous media, and the corresponding aldol adducts were obtained
in good yield with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity. Here, high temperature is
not required in most of the water-mediated aldol reactions, which is the main merit
of this strategy.
At room temperature, a semi-heterogenous polydiacetylene-proline (pDApro)-
catalyzed aldol reaction between several aldehydes and cyclohexanone using12.2 Nucleophilic Addition Reactions 239
water as a solvent was devised by Doris and coworkers [28]. Here, aryl aldehydes
bearing electron-withdrawing groups afforded good yields of the aldol adducts,
whereas benzaldehyde and para-methoxy benzaldehyde provided low yields. The
low catalyst loading, use of water as the media, reusability of the catalyst, good
yields, as well as good enantio- and diastereoselectivity of the products are the main
peculiarities of this protocol.
In 2019, Wang and coworkers discussed the vinylogous aldol reaction of α,α￾dicyanoolefins with silyl glyoxylates catalyzed by DABCO in water media [29].
This strategy tolerates silyl glyoxylates bearing t-butyl ester, cyclohexyl-based
ester, and electron-rich groups, whereas both electron-poor and electron-rich sub￾stituents in the aryl rings of α,α-dicyanoolefins smoothly reacted well and afforded
α-hydroxysilanes in high yields.
The water-mediated aldol protocol is an inevitable part of the construction of C–C
bondsin various natural products and bioactive compounds. For example, 3-hydroxy
oxindole, a well-known bioactive compound, was synthesized using WERSA (water
extract ofrice straw ash) byChowhan and coworkers[30]. The aldolreaction of isatin
with β-ketoacid was performed via WERSA-catalyzed aldol reaction. A wide range
of substrates were explored, which revealed that the C-5 positions of isatin-bearing
electron-rich and electron-poor substituents were compatible with this methodol￾ogy. In the case of β-ketoacid, the presence of electron-donating moieties at the C-4
and C-3 positions of its aryl ring afforded satisfactory yields of the expected prod￾ucts in comparison with the electron-deficient ones. It was noticed that the elec￾tronic effects offered by functional groups in the various positions of both isatin and
β-ketoacid played a significant role in determining the yield of the reaction.
Recently, a cobalt nanocomposite (CoOx@NC-800) catalyst was found to be effec￾tive in the chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonylsin water[31].
This nanocomposite catalyzed one-pot cross-aldol reaction followed by hydrogena￾tion has been utilized for the synthesis of saturated carbonyls from aldehydes and
ketones, and the strategy was applied in the synthesis of Loureirin A, a well-known
bioactive compound.
Sumathi and coworker reacted 2-ethoxy-2H-chromene chalcones with barbituric
acid and pyrazolin-5-one in water media, catalyzed by L-proline, to produce
4-hydroxy-4H-chromene barbiturates and 4-hydroxy-4H-chromene-pyrazoles in
good yields [32]. This protocol involves the removal of the −OC2H5 group, Michael
addition, aldol condensation, and hydrolysis reactions. High yields and a short
reaction time are the merits of this eco-friendly approach (Scheme 12.6).
Wang and coworkers synthesized highly electron-poor molecular cage catalysts
that were used in the aldol decarboxylative reactions[33]. Here, the reaction was car￾ried out between half thioesters of malonic acid and aryl aldehydes in the presence
of a 5 mol% cage catalyst in water at room temperature that afforded the expected
products in good yields.
Kim and coworkers synthesized a variety of α-hydroxy-α-nitromethylamides
through a water-mediated nitroaldol reaction (the Henry reaction) [34]. The reac￾tion between nitromethane and α-keto amide was catalyzed by L-arginine in
H2O at 25 ∘C for six hours, which afforded the expected products in high yields.240 12 Nucleophilic Addition and Substitution Reactions In-Water

The highlights of this protocol include the wide substrate scope, eco-friendliness,
as well as mild reaction environments.
The asymmetric aldol reaction of ketones with isatins, described by Da and
coworkers is one of the best routes for the synthesis of 3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles
[35]. This reaction was found to take place at room temperature in the presence
of a bifunctional chiral amine catalyst in water media. The wide substrate scope,
recyclability of the catalyst, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendly nature of the
protocol are the main attractions of this strategy. The position and electronic effects
of the substituents on isatin have a great influence on the stereoselectivity of
the products. Cyclic ketones like tetrahydro-4H-thio-pyran-4-one, 3-methyl, and
4-methyl cyclohexanone were tolerated in this protocol. A gram-scale reaction was
also done to ensure the scalability of the reaction, using cyclohexanone and isatin
as the starting materials.
12.3 Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions
Nucleophilic substitution reactions represent fundamental processes in organic
chemistry, wherein a nucleophile replaces a leaving group in a molecule. These
reactions are crucial for the construction of new bonds and for the modification of
organic compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions find widespread applica￾tions in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials science, making them
one of the standing pillars of organic synthesis. Nucleophilic substitution reactions
are mainly classified into SN1 (substitution nucleophilic unimolecular), SN2 (sub￾stitution nucleophilic bimolecular), and SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution)
reactions. Performing these reactions in aqueous media faces many challenges, and
the scientific community is constantly working to overcome them. The past few
years have witnessed a dramatic evolution in this field by designing new catalysts,
using surfactants, phase transfer catalysts, flow chemistry, catalyst-free reflux
protocols, etc.12.3 Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions 241
12.3.1 Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution Reactions (SNAr)
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions (SNAr) can modify aromatic systems
with precision and play a pivotal role in organic synthesis. In these reactions,
an aromatic ring bearing an electron-withdrawing group acts as the stage for a
nucleophile’s attack, leading to the substitution of the aromatic ring. Unlike the
conventional nucleophilic substitutions occurring at saturated carbon centers,
SNAr reactions occur at sp2-hybridized carbon atoms within aromatic systems. Per￾forming SNAr reactions in aqueous environments poses significant challenges due
to the comparatively low reactivity of many nucleophiles and substrates in water.
Innovative approaches such as micellar catalysis, biocatalysis, and polymer-based
hydrophobic pockets have been harnessed to enhance the reactivity and selectivity
of SNAr reactions in water. This transformative shift toward conducting SNAr
reactions in water not only overcomes environmental concerns associated with
traditional solvents but also expands the synthetic toolbox to embrace sustainable
methodologies.
A highly greener SNAr reaction in micellar medium using oxygen, nitrogen, and
sulfur nucleophiles was reported by Lipshutz and coworkers at near room tempera￾ture conditions [36]. Heteroaromatic and aromatic substrates smoothly underwent
this micellar catalysis using 2 wt % TPGS-750-M as the surfactant and K3PO4 base
(Scheme 12.7). The key advantages of this protocol include a 1 : 1 ratio of reaction
partners, easy recyclability of the catalytic system, replacing aprotic solvents using
nanomicellar reactors in an aqueous medium, a low E factor, etc.

A base-free and metal-free aqueous protocol for the construction of pharmaceuti￾cally relevant tetrahydroquinoline spiro motifs was achieved via a cascade reaction
involving SNAr [37]. Various active methylene compounds and 2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)
benzaldehydes were the building blocks of this protocol, which reacted on water at
room temperature for 48 hours. It is a four-step cascade protocol involving an initial
SNAr, followed by Knoevenagel condensation and [1,5]-hydride transfer, and a final
cyclization. Thisinnovative protocol features high atom economy and step economy,
a simple reaction set-up, and mild conditions.
Later, Verma and coworkers designed an innovative metal-free and base-free
multicomponent cascade synthesis of benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-ylidene benzamide
on water [38]. They treated acrylates, aroyl isothiocyanates, and ortho-iodoanilines
using triethyl amine as a catalyst on water at 90 ∘C for 20 hours. The initial thiourea242 12 Nucleophilic Addition and Substitution Reactions In-Water
intermediate formation and subsequent SNAr and Michael additions gave the
desired products in good yields. Operationally simple cascade approaches, excellent
yields and regioselectivity, and mild reaction conditions are the attractive features
of this one-pot protocol.
Shortly thereafter, another catalyst-free and base-free reaction in water was
put forward by Al-Harrasi and coworkers for the nucleophilic substitution of
nitroimidazoles with enolizable 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds [39]. This flexible SNAr
reaction was conducted at a refluxing temperature without the aid of a catalyst or
additives.
The SNAr substitution of perfluorobenzocycloalkenones was successfully
achieved in alkaline water by Mezhenkova and coworkers in 2021 [40]. When
polyfluorinated aromatic ketones were treated with K2CO3 under aqueous con￾ditions, the fluorine atom ortho- or para- to the carbonyl group underwent SNAr
substitution by a hydroxide ion. Interestingly, the dicarbonyl derivatives were more
susceptible to transformation than the corresponding monoketones.
Subsequently, an efficient and sustainable SNAr reaction between a variety of
nucleophiles and electrophiles was achieved using the environmentally benign
polymeric substance hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) in aqueous medium
[41]. This newly designed HMPC–water system offers SNAr reactions of various
N, O, and S nucleophiles in the presence of KOH (Scheme 12.8). The corre￾sponding products were obtained in good yields with broad functional group
tolerance. The main attractive features of this interesting protocol include a
short reaction time, excellent regio- and chemoselectivities, and ambient reaction
temperature.

Very recently, a biomass-derived polymeric surface-active additive, HPMC,
directed aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions in water via hydrophobic
effects was reported [42]. Kappe and his research team carried out these SNAr
reactions of various nucleophiles with electrophiles in an oscillatory plug flow
reactor (OFR). Notably, this aqueous reaction is scalable and robust.12.3 Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions 243
12.3.2 SN1 and SN2 Reactions
Aqueous SN1 and SN2 reactions have propelled the field of organic synthesis toward
a more sustainable and greener phase. SN1 and SN2 reactions are fundamental trans￾formations in organic chemistry, involving the substitution of a leaving group with
a nucleophile at a saturated carbon center. Traditionally, these reactions were pre￾dominantly carried out in organic solvents. Carrying out SN1 and SN2 reactions in
aqueous media presentsseveral challenges, primarily due to the unique properties of
water and the nature of the reactions themselves. Substrate solubility issues, nucle￾ophile solvation and reduction of its reactivity, instability of intermediates due to
nucleophilic attack by water molecules, and less compatibility of many catalytic
systems in water are the major hurdles in this arena. Researchers have developed
innovative catalytic systems to promote SN1 and SN2 reactions in water. Transition
metal catalysis, phase-transfer catalysis, and micellar catalysis have been optimized
to enhance the reaction rates, selectivity, and efficiency in aqueous media. Further￾more, deep eutectic solvents have been investigated for their potential to enhance
SN1 and SN2 reactions in water.
Azumaya and team designed an aqueous S-benzylation with the aid of
π-benzylpalladium(II) [43]. In this synthetic strategy, benzylic alcohols under￾went nucleophilic substitution with benzenethiols bearing electron-deficient
groups in aqueous media in the presence of 5 mol% Pd(OAc)2 and 10 mol%
sodium diphenylphosphinobenzene-3-sulfonate (TPPMS) at 120 ∘C for 16 hours
(Scheme 12.9a). The S-benzylated products were obtained in good yields. Surpris￾ingly, water plays an important role in the benzylic alcohol activation and the
formation of crucial π-benzylpalladium(II) complexes. This is an efficient atom
economical pathway, rendering water the only byproduct.

Soon after, the same research group came up with a cationic palladium(II)
additive-free catalytic system for the aqueous S-benzylation of benzhydryl alcohols
[44]. Benzhydryl alcohol underwent nucleophilic substitution with benzenethiol
having electron-deficient groups in the presence of 5 mol% PdCl2(MeCN)2 in water
at 120 ∘C for 16 hours under air (Scheme 12.9b). This additive-free nucleophilic
substitution is an atom economic process with water as the only byproduct.244 12 Nucleophilic Addition and Substitution Reactions In-Water
Subsequently, Vigalok and coworkers explored hydrotropic NaOT solution as
a green reaction medium for SN1 and SN2 reactions [45]. They carried out exo-2-
norbornyl sulfonate hydrolysis via the SN1 reaction using 3.8M NaOTs at room
temperature. The hydrotropic NaOT solution was also proven to be the best reaction
medium for benzylic bromide cyanation via the SN2 reaction using NaCN at 30 ∘C.
This hydrotropic media can be easily recycled and reused, and it opens a new arena
for organic reactions in an environmentally benign medium.
Continuing the exploration into aqueous protocols, Azumaya and coworkers
reported a cobalt(II)/TPPMS (sodium diphenylphosphinobenzene-3-sulfonate)
catalyzed conversion of allylic and benzylic anilines to the corresponding amines
in water [46]. The alcohols underwent dehydrative amination in the presence of
cobalt(II)/TPPMS catalytic system in an aqueous medium at 120 ∘C for 16 hours.
The atom economical nature, simple reaction set-up, and additive- and base-free
conditions elevate the greener face of this nucleophilic substitution protocol.
A novel dicataonic PEG ionic liquid-associated MnCl4
2− (PEG-DIL-MnCl4)
catalyst for the nucleophilic substitution of benzyl halides was put forward by
Davarpanah and team [47]. Using this environment-friendly catalyst, they synthe￾sized a variety of benzyl azides and thiocyanates in water under reflux conditions.
(E)-1,3-Diphenylallyl acetate underwent allylic substitution using various nucle￾ophilesin an aqueous medium. This metal-free nucleophilic substitution was carried
out using nucleophiles such as benzylamine, phenol, acetylacetone, sodium azide,
and indole at 50 ∘C for 24 hours in water. Notably, for phenol and acetylacetone, the
presence of 20 mol% NaOt
Bu was needed for the smooth conversion into allylated
products. Moreover, the amines needed only 16 hours for the complete conversion
into products. This green protocol follows an SN1 mechanism.
Concurrently, with the aid of the NaOH-water system, biologically important
Ataluren analogues and 3,5-disubstituted 1,2,4-oxadiazoles were synthesized by
Rangappa and coworkers [48] The amidoxime was reacted with dithioesters via an
interesting nucleophilic substitution–dehydration–intramolecular ring formation
under transition metal-free conditions at 90 ∘C for 7–10 hours. This green protocol
offers excellent yields and wide functional group compatibility.
An interesting P–S coupling via nucleophilic substitution in water was devel￾oped by Zeng and coworkers in 2019 [49]. This metal-free reaction between
diarylphosphines, H-phosphonate esters, and H-phosphine oxides with N-(aryl/
alkylthio)succinimides rendered thiophosphates, thiophosphinites, and thiophos￾phinates in aqueous medium at 40 ∘C in 120 minutes under an air atmosphere.
The mild reaction conditions, metal-free and base-free conditions, environmentally
benign nature, scalability, and wide substrate scope are the appealing features of
this protocol.
In the same year, a transition-metal-free aqueous C(sp3)–S coupling was
developed by Dong and coworker [50]. The SN2 reaction between tetraalkylth￾iuram disulfide with benzyl halide using one equivalents of K2CO3 in water at
100 ∘C for 0.5–3 hours delivered the benzyl dithiocarbamates in excellent yields.
Environmental friendliness,simplicity in performing the reaction, excellent product
yields, and functional group tolerance are the attractive features of this protocol.12.3 Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions 245
Active methylene compounds were selectively C-arylalkylated in an aqueous
medium with the aid of CTAB [51]. This environmentally friendly nucleophilic sub￾stitution of arylalkyl halides with active methylene compounds was accomplished
using K2CO3 in the presence of the phase transfer catalyst CTAB in water at 60 ∘C
for 16 hours. The research group also demonstrated the gram-scale synthesis of this
highly regioselective transformation.
Herrera and coworkers effectively functionalized π-activated alcohols via nucle￾ophilic substitution in water [52]. They successfully utilized C-, S-, and P-centered
nucleophiles such as 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, pyrroles, indoles, anilines,
pyridine-2-thiol, and diphenyl phosphite to substitute π-activated alcohols in water
in the presence of 20 mol% AcOH at room temperature for 3–10 hours. Operational
simplicity, mild reaction conditions, regioselectivity, recyclability of the catalytic
system, and high atom economy are the attractive features of this green protocol.
An excellent atom economic strategy to synthesize allylic amines in an aqueous
medium via a metal-free catalytic route was established by Miao and coworkers in
2021[53]. They used Bu4NHSO4 as the non-metal catalyst for this direct pyrazole
N-allylation. Allylic alcohols were reacted with pyrazoles at 100 ∘C for 12 hours in
water in the presence of Bu4NHSO4 (Scheme 12.10). This protocol offered excel￾lent recyclability and was found to be suitable for gram-scale synthesis. Interest￾ingly, the intramolecular H-bonding interaction between water and allylic alcohols
plays an inevitable role in the successful proceeding of this nucleophilic substitution
reaction.

In continuation of theirinterest in reactionsin aqueous media, an Au(III)/sodium
diphenylphosphinobenzene-3-sulfonate (TPPMS)-catalyzed dehydrative amination
was performed by Azumaya and coworkers in 2022 [54]. The benzhydrols were
reacted with 2-aminopyridines having electron-withdrawing groups in the presence
of 5 mol% HAuCl4 and 10 mol% TPPMS in water at 120 ∘C for 16 hours under an air
atmosphere. The current gold-catalyzed water protocol offers excellent yields and
high functional group tolerance
In 2023, Yu and coworkers developed an interesting photocatalyst-free, visible￾light-driven α-substitution of amines with various nucleophiles in an organo-aqua
(MeCN/THF/H2O = 2 : 1 : 2)solventsystem [55]. Wateris essential to the in situ pro￾duction of substrate aggregates in this catalyst-free air-promoted reaction, which is
a crucial stage in this transformation. The attractive features of the protocol include
green reaction set-up, high functional group compatibility, and easy operation.
Biologically potent selenocyanates and thiocyanites were constructed in a water￾dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (20 : 1)solventsystem using selenonium salt asthe effec￾tive catalyst [56]. Alberto and his team reacted organic bromides with seleno- or246 12 Nucleophilic Addition and Substitution Reactions In-Water
thiocyanates at ambient temperature for 10 minutes, which delivered the anticipated
products in good yields. The effectiveness of this protocol lies in the key chalcogen
bond interactions between the organic bromides and selenonium catalyst.
Later, Mukherjee and coworkers successfully established vanadium-catalyzed S￾and C-alkylation in an aqueous medium via nucleophilic substitution [57]. This
dehydrative alkylation was achieved by reacting benzhydrols with thiols and arenes
in the presence of a 4 mol% divanadium oxoperoxo system [K3(V+5)2(O2
2−)4(O2−)2
(𝜇-OH)] at 40 ∘C in water for four hours under air. Interestingly, the catalytic system
retains its activity over seven runs. Excellent substrate scope, mild reaction condi￾tions, base- and additive-free nature, and water as the only co-product are the key
advantages of this protocol.
During the same year, Acocella and coworkerssynthesized a novel phosphonium￾carbon-based phase transfer catalyst oCB/TPP (oxidized carbon black-tetraphenyl
phosphonium filler) [58]. This newly fabricated heterogeneous catalyst successfully
catalyzed the SN2 reaction between NaSCN and various benzyl bromides, employing
water as the reaction medium. Only 5 mol% of the catalyst was needed for thistrans￾formation. A short reaction span and excellent recyclability are the other attractive
features of this protocol.
The introduction of carbon black intercalated compounds as phase transfer cat￾alysts for the SN2 reaction of 4-nitrobenzyl bromide with NaSCN was reported by
Acocella and coworkers in 2023 [59]. This nucleophilic substitution was carried out
in a biphasic CHCl3/H2O liquid system using 5 mol% oCB/2HT (oxidized carbon
black intercalated with quaternary ammonium salt). This heterogeneous catalyst
shows excellent recyclability without losing its catalytic activity many times.
12.4 Summary and Conclusions
Recent years have seen remarkable progress in nucleophilic addition and substitu￾tion reactions conducted in water. The development of novel water-active catalytic
systems, the engineering of dualsolventsystems with water as a key component, the
evolution ofsurfactants capable of facilitating reactions within hydrophobic pockets,
and the implementation of flow chemistry have been notable advancements in this
field. These innovations tackle several challenges previously encountered in carry￾ing out nucleophilic addition and substitution reactions in water, such as substrate
solubility issues, nucleophile solvation and reduction of its reactivity, the instability
of intermediates due to nucleophilic attack by water molecules, and the limited com￾patibility of many catalytic systems with aqueous environments. By addressing these
obstacles, the recent advancements pave the way for more efficient and sustainable
nucleophilic reactions in water. Overall, these advancements represent significant
stridestoward overcoming limitations and expanding the scope of nucleophilic addi￾tion and substitution reactions in aqueous environments.
So, nucleophilic substitution and addition reactions in-water offer numerous
advantages, including their alignment with green chemistry principles, abundance
and accessibility of water,safety considerations, versatility in facilitating hydrophilicReferences 247
and hydrophobic interactions, potential for reaction acceleration, and relevance
to biological systems. Persisting research inquiries surrounding nucleophilic
addition and substitution methodologies in water, alongside the proliferation of
catalytic systems and methodologies effective in aqueous environments, indicate
that the field is ripe with untapped potential. This chapter seeks to underscore
the profound promise of water as a reaction medium, capable of facilitating both
nucleophilic addition and substitution. By simplifying synthetic routes and driving
advancements toward sustainable chemistry, these water protocols emerge as a
transformative force in the realm of organic synthesis.

Asymmetric Organic Reactions in Water

13.1 Introduction
Asymmetric synthesis in water has been extensively explored over the past several
decades [1]. Merck’s asymmetric alkylation using cinchona-based chiral quaternary
ammonium salts (phase-transfer catalysts) in 1984 probably represents a significant
starting point for modern asymmetric aqueous catalytic processes[2]. Subsequently,
reactions using water-compatible catalysts gained considerable attention, and there
is a growing anticipation that sustainable chemistry can be applied to synthesizing
natural products and myriad pharmaceuticals [1, 3]. Water-compatible asymmetric
synthesis in aqueous environments was initially explored enzymatically, inspired
by biological processes [4]. However, the limited reaction scope of enzymatic pro￾cessesled to ongoing effortsto create new substances efficiently and selectively using
precisely designed molecular catalyst systems. These molecular catalytic systems
include combinations of metals with organic chiral ligands and, more recently, chiral
organocatalysts in finely designed homogeneous catalytic systems [5]. The reported
asymmetric reactions in water can be classified based on the key catalytic activation
mechanisms as(i) asymmetric metal (Lewis acid) catalysis, (ii) asymmetric Lewis base
organocatalysis, (iii) asymmetric Brønsted acid organocatalysis, and (iv) asymmetric
Brønsted base organocatalysis.
In this chapter, we focus on the recent trend of asymmetric catalytic reactions
in water and emphasize significant findings from past decades that have not been
covered in previous publications [6]. More specifically, we highlight reactions that
involve the use of water as the reaction medium and showcase outcomes character￾ized by positive effects in reactivity and selectivity attributable to bulk-water envi￾ronments.

13.2 Asymmetric Metal (Lewis Acid) Catalysis in Water
13.2.1 Asymmetric Reduction
13.2.1.1 Carbonyl (C=O Bond) Reduction
Deng and coworkers reported an asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aliphatic
ketones in water using a rhodium (Rh) catalyst [7]. High enantioselectivities
resulted from a synergistic interaction between the catalytic center and the
lipophilic microenvironment within a metallomicelle core. Chiral surfactant-type
ligand 1 complexed with rhodium was successfully utilized for the asymmetric
reduction of diverse aliphatic ketones. The proposed transition state was based
on the considerations of steric interactions between the alkyl groups of aliphatic
ketones and the cyclopentadienyl (Cp*) ligand of an amphiphilic catalyst, during
which hydrophobic interactions in the metallomicelle contributed to the high
enantioselectivity of ketone reduction (Scheme 13.1).

The Deng group presented an asymmetric reduction of cyclic imines and iminiums
in water using a ruthenium (Ru) catalyst (Scheme 13.2) [8]. By employing sodium
formate as the hydrogen source and cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant
additive, a water-soluble Ru(II) complex of the (R,R)-ligand 2 was used as a recy￾clable catalyst in an aqueous reaction. Unnatural isoquinoline and β-carboline alka￾loids with potential biological (psychotropic) properties were catalytically prepared
with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee).13.2 Asymmetric Metal (Lewis Acid) Catalysis in Water 253

13.2.2.1 Epoxidation
The Malkov group reported asymmetric vanadium (V)-catalyzed epoxidation of
allylic alcohols in water [9]. The hydroxamic acid functional group at chiral ligand
3 was crucial for this reaction. Various allylic alcohols as starting materials were
successfully converted to the desired enantio-enriched epoxides. Well known for its
ligand-deceleration effect under conventional organic solvents, it was transformed
into a ligand-accelerated process under an aqueous reaction medium. The aqueous
environment enabled the V-catalyzed epoxidation of allylic alcohols at up to 94% ee
(Scheme 13.3).

a novel iron complex (4, Fe(salan),salan= N,N′
-disubstituted bis(aminophenoxide))/
aqueous hydrogen peroxide system without surfactant (Scheme 13.4) [10]. Sub￾strates from alkyl-aryl sulfides to methyl-alkyl sulfides were successfully oxidized to

13.2.3.1 Allylation
The Nakamura group reported catalytic asymmetric Barbier-type allylation using
indium (In) powder and chiral bis(imidazoline)ligand 5 in water via a six-membered
transition state involving In(III) (Scheme 13.5) [11]. The reaction in organic solvents
(e.g. THF: tetrahydrofuran) resulted in a significant decrease in enantioselectivity.
The inclusion of sodium iodide as an additive enhanced both yield and enantiose￾lectivity. In the transition state, the resulting octahedral structure allowed the allyl
group to approach the Re-face of ketones, ensuring (R)-homoallylic alcohols and
avoiding steric repulsion between the phenyl group in ligand 5 and ketone sub￾stituents.

three-component alkynylation involving aldehydes, amines, and alkynes in water
(Scheme 13.6) [12]. Cu(I) catalyst with hydrophobic bis(imidazoline) ligand 5 and
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant were used as efficient catalytic compo￾nents. The reaction demonstrated broad substrate scope across various aldehydes
and alkynes, yielding optically active propargyl amines with outstanding yields (up

Kobayashi and coworkers described a chiral palladium (Pd) aqua complex cat￾alyzed by Friedel–Crafts-type alkylation of indoles in water (Scheme 13.7) [13].
Pd-coordinated water molecules have recently emerged as novel soft Lewis acid
catalysts. Employing a chiral 2,2′
-bipyridine (Bolm’s ligand) [14] 6 as both ligand
and hydrogen bond donor facilitated the creation of a robust, highly Lewis acidic,
chiral aqua complex in water. On the other hand, enantioselectivity was difficult to
control in organic solvents or under solvent-free conditions.

The Kobayashi group presented chiral scandium (Sc) catalysts that serve as simple
metalloenzyme-like catalysts in water that mimic enzyme structures (Scheme 13.8)
[15]. These artificial organometallic catalysts (Sc with 7) efficiently facilitated enan￾tioselective direct aldol-type reactions of enolates using aqueous formaldehyde as
an acceptor. The aqueous catalytic system follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics and
possesses heat-resistant properties.256 13 Asymmetric Organic Reactions in Water

(Scheme 13.9) [16]. Chiral β-amino alcohols were produced at high yields and enan￾tioselectivities using catalytic amounts of scandium tris(dodecyl sulfate) (Sc(DS)3)
as a Lewis acid surfactant, without diol formation. The authors commented that the
use of organic components at greater concentrations might enhance hydrophobic
interactions and improve results.

thiolsto enones catalyzed by a scandium-chiral 2,2′

[17]. These reactions proceeded in water and organic solvents, though superiorselec￾tivity was achieved in water. As regards protonation, lower yields and enantiose￾lectivities were observed in organic solvents, and notably, highly enantioselective
protonation occurred in water (Scheme 13.10).

13.3.1.2 Using Polymer-Supported Proline Catalyst
The Pericàs group reported the use of a proline-supported functional polymer 9 to
achieve the same direct asymmetric aldol reaction in water (Scheme 13.14) [21].
Proline bound to polystyrene with a 1,2,3-triazole linker exhibited catalytic proper￾ties tailored for ‘artificial aldolase’. Despite the hydrophobic nature of the polymeric
backbone, the resin swelled in water, creating an aqueous microenvironment. The
exceptionally high reactivity and enantioselectivity observed were presumed to be
due to the confinement effect of the hydrogen-bond networks produced by proline
and 1,2,3-triazole fragments.13.3 Asymmetric Lewis Base Organocatalysis in Water 259

The Barbas group reported an asymmetric Michael addition reaction of carbonyl
compounds to β-nitroolefins in saturated NaCl and seawater [22]. A bifunctional
hydrophobic organocatalyst 8 was used and efficiently afforded the desired Michael
products in excellent yields with high enantioselectivity. The aggregation of organic
components led to the exclusion of water from the oil phase and shifted the equi￾librium toward enamine formation. The process was also possibly enhanced by a
salting-out effect. The rapid Michael addition reaction took place within the highly
concentrated organic phase via a transition state similar to that observed in homo￾geneous organic solvents (Scheme 13.15).

11 used in iminium catalysis enabled the enantioselective synthesis of Diels–Alder
products, previously inaccessible in the presence of metal Lewis acid catalysts.
A large number of cyclic and acyclic dienes were reacted with α,β-unsaturated
ketones via asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition. A computational study provided
theoretical evidence for the enantioinduction observed during the catalytic

occurred in the organic phase (not at the water/oil interface). Notably, a tiny amount

Bae and Song reported biomimetic Michael addition “on-water” [28] via Brønsted
base catalysis (Scheme 13.20) [29]. The quinuclidine moiety in cinchona alkaloids
(e.g. quinine, quinidine, cinchonidine, and cinchonine) [30] serves as highly effi￾cient tertiary amine bases to deprotonate enolate precursors. Water proved to be an
exceptionally efficient medium for the non-covalent, hydrogen bonding-mediated
asymmetric Michael addition of malonates (and β-ketoesters) to diverse aryl- and
alkyl-nitroolefins using dihydroquinine-derived squaramide bifunctional (weak
acid–Brønsted base) organocatalyst 14. The developed aquatic organocatalysis was
applied to the multigram scalable syntheses of (S)-rolipram (an antidepressant) and
(S)-pregabalin (an anticonvulsant).

Unreactive acceptors worked during similar Michael addition by taking advan￾tage of the hydrophobic hydration effects of water [31]. The Song group reported
dithiomalonates (DTMs), which proved to be superior enolate donors rather than
simple malonates for the Michael addition using the same bifunctional organocat￾alyst 14 [32]. Complex substrates such as β,β-disubstituted nitroolefins successfully
participated in asymmetric Michael addition reactions to provide products with chi￾ral all-carbon quaternary centers (Scheme 13.21).

reactions with several challenging substrates incorporating primary alkyl sub￾stituents; these reactions did not proceed with less-reactive simple malonates
and monothiomalonates. The synthetic utility of the enantio-enriched Mannich
adduct was utilized for the first organocatalytic preparation of the antidiabetic drug

13.5.2.2 Using Hydrophobic Cinchona Alkaloids: Amplification
of Enantioselectivity
Song et al. reported remarkable “chirality amplification” for an asymmetric Man￾nich reaction within a confined water cage “on-water” [34]. Hydrophobic hydra￾tion effectsincreased proximity between the organocatalyst and substrates,resulting
in better enantioselectivity than that obtained using conventional organic solvents.
Control experiments showed that reducing droplet size could further enhance chi￾rality amplification. Furthermore, simply prepared hydrophobic cinchona alkaloid
catalysts (such as 16) were more enantioselective than natural cinchona alkaloids
(cinchonine or cinchonidine). The authors commented on a plausible and inter￾esting scenario for the homochiral state, derived from the aqueous environment
of the primordial earth that included phenomena, such as mist, clouds, and spray
(Scheme 13.23).

13.5.3.1 Using tert-Amine Squaramide Catalyst
Li and coworkers reported the asymmetric conjugated addition of triphenyl￾methanethiol to directly generated ortho-quinone methides (o-QMs). The water/oil
biphasic system was crucial for achieving high reactivity and stereoselectivity [35].
In the organic phase, o-QMs are generated by a Brønsted basic tertiary amine at
the catalyst 17; the resulting protonated catalyst can be regenerated by an inorganic
base (Na2CO3) in the aqueous phase. Tertiary amine activates thiol as a nucleophile,
and squaramide hydrogen bond donors facilitate Michael-type addition to o-QMs
(Scheme 13.24).

The Song group reported catalytic asymmetric protonation in water using an

protons in aqueous media, enantioselective protonation of a prochiral carbon ion
is challenging. Inspired by enzymatic systems, such as glyoxalase I, the authors
established enantioselective isomerization of in situ generated hemithioacetals13.6 Summary and Conclusions 265

13.6 Summary and Conclusions
Recent trends in enantioselective aqueous organic synthesis primarily involve the
use of water-compatible metal catalysts or organocatalysts. Breakthrough examples
of asymmetric syntheses in water based on different key catalytic activation modes
are provided in this chapter. Catalytic activation via ionic (electron pair-involved)
acid–base interactions broadly represents the current state of the art. Therefore,
the mechanisms can be categorized as Lewis acid, Lewis base, Brønsted acid,
and Brønsted base catalyses. Despite significant advancements in organocatalysis
including Nobel Prize-winning achievements, [5, 37] a water-compatible asymmet￾ric Brønsted acid catalysis requires further development. One possibly interesting
example of non-asymmetric synergistic Brønsted acid-hydrogen bonding donor
(DBSA [4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid] with 19) catalysis in water by the Bae group
is displayed in Scheme 13.26 [38]. An asymmetric version of this process can be a
useful challenge for future investigations.
Additionally, water-accelerated catalytic reactions targeting the syntheses of
functionalized alkylsulfonyl fluorides, which facilitate sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange266 13 Asymmetric Organic Reactions in Water

such related examples showcasing asymmetric processes utilizing emerging trends
in phosphazene organosuperbase [41] or N-heterocyclic carbene [42] remains
elusive.
Asymmetric reactions of photochemistry [43] or electrochemistry [44] in bulk
water are anticipated in the near future. Some attractive examples of new reactions
based on emerging radical mechanisms (e.g. single-electron and energy transfer)
in water have been described [45], though enantioselective versions remain in the
early developmental stage. These fascinating catalytic processes will undoubtedly
provide an efficient means of generating enantio-enriched products in aqueous
environments.
Further, water-promoted asymmetric synthetic methodologies utilizing tailored
biocatalysts (directed evolution) are of considerable interest [46]. Although not
discussed in the main text, technical advances have led to the development of
biotechnologies that enable the design of new functional enzymes. For example,
chiral pharmaceutical, such as sitagliptin, is now produced industrially using
asymmetric reductive amination reactions using designed enzymes [47]. Numerous
research groups are actively exploring this field and developing novel biocatalysts.

14.1 Introduction
Nowadays, sustainable organic transformations are in high demand both in
academia and in the chemical industries to prevent the side effects of the hazardous
substances associated or generated in chemical processes [1–4]. Scientists are trying
to take all necessary steps to protect our “Mother Nature” from the ever-increasing
chemical pollution. Thus, special emphasis has been given to design the chemical
transformations more environmentally friendly and sustainable by using non￾hazardous reagents, catalysts, and solvents [5–8]. As a result, the last decade has
witnessed a tremendous outburst in the modification of chemical processes to make
them more sustainable and environmentally benign. Catalysts play an important
role in organic synthesis among other parameters. Though a large number of
various metal catalysts have been applied for diverse organic transformations, these
days scientists are reluctant to use metal catalysts due to their toxic nature and to
avoid metal contamination. A large number of research groups aimed at developing
suitable, as well as sustainable alternatives to avoid the use of toxic metal catalysts.
The use of metal-free organocatalysis in chemical transformations fulfills this
goal on many occasions due to their nontoxicity and biodegradable nature [9–13].
Realizing the importance of organocatalysis, in 2021, List and MacMillan were
awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for carrying out diverse asymmetric reactions
by using chiral organic substances as catalysts.
On the other hand, wateris considered the safestsolvent to carry out organic trans￾formations as it is cheap, environmentally benign, nonflammable, and abundantly
available. Water behaves differently than other organic solvents, as it can activate
the functional groups by forming hydrogen bonds [14, 15]. Additionally, the high
surface tension and hydrophobic nature of organic reactants bound to aggregate
with each other in aqueous medium to decrease the exposed organic surface area.
This helps reactants to get closer, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction [16–18].

Therefore, a “strong collaboration” between metal-free organocatalyst and water as
the solvent holds the key to achieving the sustainability goal. The beneficial features
in terms of sustainability have motivated organic chemists to explore the feasibility
of water-mediated organocatalyzed reactionsin more depth. As a result, the catalytic
activity of a wide variety of metal-free organocatalysts has been screened in aqueous
medium for diverse organic transformations. A series of amines, amino acids,surfac￾tants, and other organic compounds with reactive functional groups are frequently
used as efficient organocatalysts. In 2016, Jimeno [19] compiled a large number of
literature related to water-mediated asymmetric synthesis. In 2019, Eelkema and
coworkers[20] published an interesting review on water-mediated organocatalysis.
In this chapter, we have summarized the latest developments on water-mediated
organocatalyzed reactions reported during the last four years.
14.2 Organocatalyzed Synthesis of Biologically
Promising N-Heterocycles in Water
14.2.1 Synthesis of Decahydroacridine-1,8-Diones
and Dihydropyrido[2,3-d:6,5-d′
]Dipyrimidines
In 2020, Bhosle et al. [21] developed a simple, facile, and water-mediated pro￾tocol for the synthesis of a series of decahydroacridine-1,8-diones (5), as well as
dihydropyrido[2,3-d:6,5-d′
]dipyrimidine derivatives (6), in excellent yields via the
one-pot three-component reaction of substituted anilines (1), 4-((2-phenylthiazol￾4-yl)methoxy)benzaldehyde (2), and dimedone (3) or barbituric acid (4), respec￾tively, in the presence of 30 mol% taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) as an
efficient organocatalyst under reflux conditions (Scheme 14.1).

14.2.2 Synthesis of Aminocyanopyridines
In 2020, Tamaddon and Tadayonfar [22] prepared a diester cationic gemini
surfactant (DCGS) under microwave conditions according to the pathway depicted
in Scheme 14.2. Using just 5 mol% of this freshly prepared DCGS as the catalyst,14.2 Organocatalyzed Synthesis of Biologically Promising N-Heterocycles in Water 271
they synthesized a series of 2-amino-4-substituted-6-phenylnicotinonitriles (11) via
one-pot four-component reactions of substituted benzaldehydes (7), acetophenone
(8), malononitrile (9), and ammonium carbonate (10) under reflux conditions in
water (Scheme 14.3). It was proposed that the reaction occurred in the micellar
medium formed by the ionic catalyst in water. After the completion of the reaction,
the entire micellar medium was recovered and recycled for four successive runs
with practically similar efficiency.

1,2,6-Triaryl-4-arylamino-piperidine-3-ene-3-carboxylate derivatives (13) possess
immense biological activities [24]. A series of 1,2,6-triaryl-4-arylamino-piperidine￾3-ene-3-carboxylate derivatives (13) was synthesized by Dogra et al. [25] via a
one-pot pseudofive-component reaction of two molecules of substituted anilines
(1), two molecules of aromatic aldehydes(7), and one equivalent of β-keto esters(12)
in the presence of a catalytic amount of citric acid as an efficient organocatalyst at
room temperature in water (Scheme 14.4). Majority of the synthesized compounds
showed excellent antioxidant activities.

(19) by the reaction of isatoic anhydride (16), isoniazid (17), and aromatic alde￾hydes (7) in the presence of 15 mol% taurine as catalyst under reflux conditions
(Scheme 14.6). Undersimilar conditions, a series ofspirooxindole dihydroquinazoli￾nones (20) was also prepared in excellent yields via the one-pot three-component
reaction of isatoic anhydride (16), aromatic amines (1), and isatins (18). Recently,
the same reaction was realized using L-proline as an efficient organocatalyst in the
presence of Triton X-100 as a surfactant in water [28].

Recently, our group has synthesized 2-amino-3-cyano-4-aryltetrahydrobenzo[b]
pyrans (33) via the one-pot three-component reaction of aromatic aldehydes (7),
malononitrile (9), and dimedone (3) or 1,3-cyclohexanedione (3a) at room tem￾perature using SDS as an efficient surfactant type catalyst in water (Scheme 14.11)
[37]. A plausible mechanism and the role of SDS as the catalyst are shown in
Scheme 14.12. It was proposed that SDS in water formed micelles, which helped the
organic reactants to get closer to the hydrophobic interior. Under similar reaction
conditions, a series of spiropyrans (35 and 36) was synthesized in excellent yields by
the reaction of dimedone (3) or 1,3-cyclohexanedione (3a), malononitrile (9), and
isatin (18) or ninhydrin (34), respectively (Scheme 14.13).

benzoic acid as a cocatalyst at 70 ∘C (Scheme 14.14). A number of other organic
solvents, chloroform, acetonitrile, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, DMSO, 1,4-dioxane,

14.6.7 Synthesis of (E)-3-(Arylimino)Indolin-2-ones
In 2019, our group reported a facile and water-mediated protocol for the synthesis of
a series of biologically promising (E)-3-(arylimino)indolin-2-one derivatives (68) by
the reaction of various substituted anilines (1) and isatins (18) in the presence of a
catalytic amount of mandelic acid or itaconic acid as the catalyst at room temper￾ature (Scheme 14.31) [12]. (E)-2-((4-Methoxyphenyl)imino)acenaphthylen-1(2H)-
one (69) was also synthesized under similar conditions by replacing isatin (18) with
acenaphthylene-1,2-dione (27d).

Reaction in Water
In 2022, Hayashi and his research group [56] reported an asymmetric Diels–Alder
reaction between α-fluoro-α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (74) and cyclopentadiene (75)
using a catalytic amount of perchloric acid salt of diarylprolinol silyl ether at room

14.7.2 Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Aldol Reaction in Water
In 2020, Rani et al.[57] synthesized a D-glucosamine-based β-CD inclusion complex
under ultrasound-assisted conditions. By using a small amount of this novel species
as a heterogeneous catalyst in water, they accomplished the asymmetric Aldol reac￾tion between various ring ketones (27) and aromatic aldehydes (7) (Scheme 14.34).
Interestingly, a 99% syn selectivity of the desired product (77) was experienced in the
reaction of 2-cholrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone. Under similar conditions,
3-OH-3-(substituted)indolin-2-ones (78) were obtained by the reaction of cyclic
ketones 27 and isatin (18). In 2020, Keskin et al.[58] applied a novel proline-based

97%) yields with high enantioselectivity (synee upto 99%) (Scheme 14.41) [64].

14.8 Conclusions
This chapter deals with a large number of literature data reported during the last
four years related to various metal-free organocatalyzed transformations in water.
The catalytic applicability of various organic substances as catalyst in aqueous
medium has been discussed in this chapter. A variety of biologically promising
N-heterocycles, O-heterocycles, N,O-heterocycles, N,S-heterocycles, and acyclic
scaffolds were synthesized by using a variety of amines, amino acids, surfactants,
and other organic substances as catalyst under diverse reaction conditions in
water. Interestingly, asymmetric Aldol reactions, Michael addition reactions,
Diels–Alderreactions also took place enantioselectively by using various organocat￾alysts in aqueous medium. Mild reaction conditions, the use of nontoxic catalysts
and water as solvent are a few of the common advantages of these protocols
developed. On a few occasions, the catalysts applied were collected and recycled for
further runs. On a few occasions, the plausible mechanism and the probable role of
the catalyst were also discussed. We are confident that this chapter will definitely
boost the ongoing related research and motivate the readers to carry out diverse
organic transformations in aqueous medium by selecting organic substances as
catalysts.

15.1 Introduction
There has been a renewed interest in electrochemical processes in recent times,
despite their extensive history [1]. Research and innovative developments have been
made in the field of electrochemical organic synthesis [2]. In organic chemistry,
the electrochemical technique offers an alternate strategy for efficient transforma￾tion [3]. When it comes to synthesis, electrochemical methods are great because
they can get rid of waste and reuse metal reagents [4]. The utilization of environ￾mentally friendly electrons, derived from sustainable energy sources, as reactants
for the production of high-value compounds has significantly propelled research in
the realm of electrochemistry [5]. Electrochemical conversions, in accordance with
the 12 principles of green chemistry, enable the replacement of ecologically harmful
oxidants or catalysts with electrons [6]. Water is by far the most ideal medium when
it comes to environmentally friendly solvents [7]. Because different inorganic salts
are more soluble in water, conductivity as a rate-limiting factor can be ignored. Since
the discovery of decarboxylation reactions by Faraday and Kolbe, electrochemical
reactionsin aqueous media have an extended history [8]. In aqueous media, modern
electrochemistry is also well established, particularly for the conversion of biomass,
reduction of CO2, water splitting, and waste water disposal [9]. Water has been used
as a co-solvent or additive with methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and acetonitrile in
electrochemical organic synthesis. The solubility of organic chemicals, which would
lead to multiphase situations, is one disadvantage of aqueous media. However, this
“on-water” immiscibility of reactants and water also has certain special benefits for
organic synthesis [10].
The chemical industry aimsto develop aqueoussolution-based processes. In addi￾tion to itsinherent eco-friendliness, water possessesseveral desirable characteristics,
such as its availability and the fact that it requires minimal handling of solvents,
which make it an extremely attractive choice as a solvent. Developing electroor￾ganic processes that can be conducted in an aqueous solution is highly appealing

in this particular scenario. Typically, electroorganic processes in a water-based
solution are constrained by the narrow range of electrical potentials that water can
withstand without undergoing direct reduction or oxidation (as represented by
Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2)).
2H2O + 2e− ⇌ H2 + 2OH−, E0 = −1.1 V vs. Ag∕AgCl (3.5 M KCl)
(alkaline solution) (15.1)
2H2O ⇌ 4H+ + O2 + 4e−, E0 = 1.03 V vs. Ag∕AgCl (3.5 M KCl)
(acidic solution) (15.2)
15.2 Direct vs. Mediated Reductive Oxidation
and Oxidative Reduction
Low reaction yields and unwanted byproducts are the results of water reduction and
oxidation interfering with electroorganic processes. Reductive oxidation and oxida￾tive reduction are synthetic methods that have been used to report many electroor￾ganic processes in water (Scheme 15.1). In reductive oxidation, the peroxydisulfate
(S2O8
2−) is uniformly reduced using an electrogenerated Ru(NH3)6
3+ at a potential
of −0.2V vs. Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl). This process produces the sulfate radical anion,
which is capable of oxidizing species beyond those with a water oxidation potential
(E0′
(SO4
•−/SO4
2−) = 2.21V vs. Ag/AgCl). SO4
•− is produced electrochemically and
can effectively remove hydrogen atomsfrom a range of organic molecules, including
toluene and benzyl alcohol, to produce a water-soluble product. Oxidative reduction
isthe inverse process ofreductive oxidation. The powerfully reducing carbon dioxide
radical anion (E0′ (CO2
•−/CO2) = −2.1V vs. (Ag/AgCl)) is produced by the electro￾chemically generated Ru(bpy)3
3+ homogeneous oxidation of oxalate (C2O4
2−), and
it can reduce species at potentials greater than that of water or proton reduction.
The C–Br group of benzyl bromide has been uniformly reduced in aqueoussolutions
using CO2
•− as an oxidizing agent [11].
15.3 Water as a Solvent and an Electrolyte
Water is essential for life. All living organisms rely on it for their chemical pro￾cesses. Depending on temperature, the properties of water can shift, making it either
a good solvent or not so great at dissolving things. The environment in which aque￾ous media respond can be changed by adjusting temperature in accordance with
specified physical–chemical characteristics (Table 15.1) [12].
Electrosynthesis requires a conductive medium for ions to move. Water-based
electrolyte solutions are significantly superior at conducting electricity. The elec￾trolytic conductivities of aqueous electrolyte solutions are shown in Table 15.2 [13].(a)

15.4 Electrocatalysis
A catalyst that participates in electrochemical reactions is known as an electrocat￾alyst. It works on electrode surfaces, or, in certain cases, on the electrode surface
itself. It should possess long term stability, elevated activity, a large surface area,
and high electrical conductivity. Three functional and multifunctional electrocata￾lysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), and
hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) have been discovered [14].
Electrolysisisthe process of breaking down and forming bondsin an electrolyte in
a “homogeneous” system by transferring electrons to or from an inert electrode. An
essential step in fuel cells and electrolysis devices is electrocatalysis. The capacity
of electrochemical devices to convert chemicals into electrical forms is enhanced
by the availability of renewable power. This allows electrical energy to be stored in
electricity-driven conversions or produced as chemical molecules. Environmentally
friendly, sustainable, and renewable energy technologies are made possible by
electrocatalytic processes that encourage chemical or electrical interconversions.
These technologies form part of the long-term energy infrastructure [15]. Reaction

have an impact on an electrochemical device’s performance (Figure 15.1). Materials
for electrocatalysts must be engineered to enable effective functioning close to
equilibrium potential. Electrocatalysis takes place at the interface between the
electrode and the electrolyte, where reactants, ions, and products flow between
these components.
15.5 Water Electrolysis
Hydrogen and oxygen are created concurrently in conventional water electrolysis
because HER and OER are tightly coupled. This can cause explosive H2/O2 mixing
because of the gas crossover. Reactive oxygen species could be produced by the
presence of H2, O2, and electrocatalysts, which might decrease the lifespan of an
electrolyzer. There have been recent developments in innovative methods to deal
with the difficulties of traditional water electrolysis. Among these cutting-edge
approaches are decoupled water electrolysis (it uses redox mediators to separate
HER from OER both temporally and spatially), overall water electrolysis (it uses
bifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts (or precursors) to drive both HER and
OER), hybrid water electrolysis (it combines thermodynamically more favorableH2 O2

organic upgrading reactions to replace OER), and tandem water electrolysis (it uses
biocatalysts to convert the in situ produced hydrogen gas with foreign compounds
(like N2 and CO2) to more valuable products) (Figure 15.2) [16].
15.6 Organic Transformations in Water: Principles and
Applications
15.6.1 Kolbe Electrolysis
A promising process that combines the use of electrons as reagents and renewable
carboxylic acids asraw materialsto produce value-added compoundsis called Kolbe
electrolysis. The electrolysis was performed using a custom-designed electrochemi￾cal microreactor. The focus was on achieving continuous operation and reusing the
aqueous electrolyte and unreacted material (Figure 15.3) [6].
There are few reports on electrochemistry in aqueous reaction media at tem￾peratures above 100 ∘C since such cells must also be pressure and temperature
resistant. One example is the electrochemical conversion of cellulose to mixtures
of furfurals and levulenic acid in subcritical water or of lactic acid to mixtures
of acetic acid, acrylic acid, and acetaldehyde [17]. This explains why the first
electro-organic reaction, which involved the electrochemical decarboxylation of
acetic acid and dimerization of methyl radicals to produce ethane, as well as a
related reaction involving valeric acid 1 that produced octane 2 and is now known
as the Kolbe reaction, both occurred in aqueous solutions (Scheme 15.2a) [18].

Urban et al. have found a way, using the Kolbe reaction, to turn certain chemicals
into hydrocarbons when conditions are not too acidic or basic (Scheme 15.2b). The
catalytic transformation of volatile carboxylic acids from biomass in an aqueous
environment is a key part of creating a biorefinery that can endure. It is still thought
that Kolbe electrolysis isthe best way to turn aliphatic carboxylic acids(carboxylate)
into alkane for making gasoline (Scheme 15.2c).
Amorphous RuO2 is very good at electrocatalytic oxidative decarboxylation of
hexanoic acid and can make decane, which is a Kolbe product, with a yield that
is 5.4 times higher than that of regular RuO2. A fresh design idea for making an
effective electrocatalyst for the decarboxylation coupling process has been shown
(Figure 15.4) [19]. IrO2, thin-film Pt, RuO2, or boron-doped diamonds lack a
coulombic efficiency and selectivity similar to pure Pt and are hardly scalable.
Platinized titanium that is readily accessible on the market can serve as an anode
for the highly effective galvanostatic conversion of n-hexanoic acid to n-decane in a
water-based solution [20].
15.6.2 Role of Nanostructures in Electrochemical Conversions
A novel metal nanostructure produced during the electrochemical conversion will
be very interesting from the perspective of material chemistry. The reactivity of the
nanomaterial adhered to the electrode will be enhanced as a result of its greater
surface area. For example, an environmentally friendly method for producing
homoallyl alcohols/amines from basic aldehydes/imines and allylic bromides300 15 Organic Electrocatalysis in Water

has been devised. This process utilizes ZnCl2 as the reagent. The zinc(0) powder,
which was deposited and had a nanowire structure, had a significant impact on
the reaction (Figure 15.5) [21]. The organic reaction known as metal-mediated
allylation is commonly performed in aqueous solutions [22].
For the fabrication of nanomaterials, electrochemical deposition techniques are
appealing due to their ease of use and generally low-cost equipment requirements.
An appealing substitute for the deoxygenation of epoxides 1 is the electrolysis pro￾cess due to its ease of use and low environmental impact. An undivided cell has
been used to efficiently synthesize alkenes 2 using epoxides 1. In this strategy, Zn(0)
having a hierarchy-based nanostructure, facilitatesthe reaction (Scheme 15.3a) [23].

Scheme 15.3b showed that the reactivity of simple imines in an aqueous medium
was significantly influenced by the deposited zinc(0) powder with nanoscale hier￾archies. This approach became an appealing synthetic substitute for homoallylic
amines because of its excellent efficacy and green credentials. In this protocol, allyl￾metal reagents are added to C=N double bonds. These amines serve as essential
structural componentsfor a variety of nitrogen-containing compounds derived from
natural sources and biologically active chemicals [24].
15.6.3 Metal-Catalyzed Electrosynthesis in Water
This innovative technique is conducted in water-based solutions in the presence of
atmospheric oxygen. Under the influence of Pd(OAc)2, the Zn-mediated allylic alky￾lations occur without difficulty, involving various alkyl halides (including primary,
secondary, and tertiary) 6 and substituted allylic halides 7 (Scheme 15.4a) [25].
An electrochemical C–H/N–H annulation reaction of benzamide 9 with alkyne
10 at room temperature was reported by the Ackermann group in 2018
(Scheme 15.4b) [26]. The Jutand group published a study on transition metal￾catalyzed electrochemical oxidative homocoupling in 2008 (Scheme 15.4c). Once
one catalytic cycle was completed, the electronsfrom the anode were transferred via
benzoquinone to regenerate Pd0. Furthermore, it was discovered that benzoquinone
was essential in avoiding the precipitation of Pd black, which was thought to result
from the complexation of benzoquinone with Pd [27].
15.6.4 Electrochemical Oxidation in Aqueous Media
Oxidized compounds have gained significant value as fundamental components for
a diverse range of processes and refined chemistry [28], particularly in the benzylic
position. A technique forthistransformation that issustained by C–H functionaliza￾tion has been shown in Scheme 15.5a. The process relies on electrochemistry for its
power supply and draws radicals from tert-butyl hydroperoxide for the C–H abstrac￾tion using an aqueous-based medium. This approach can be easily adapted and used
for large-scale synthesis. Furthermore, medicinal chemists may be able to modify
this approach to produce oxidized analogues and enable clinical evaluation after
demonstrating its efficacy on bioactive compounds [29]. Electrochemical epoxida￾tion in aqueous media has also been well documented (Scheme 15.5b). Water acts
as an oxygen source. The Cantillo group discovered in 2021 that alkenes 18 could
be electrochemically epoxidized in THF/water. In situ formation of bromohydrin
produced epoxides 19. The reaction mixture produced 1,2-dihydroxyl intermediate
20 at 140 ∘C. In a single pot, tandem electrolysis produced aldehydes 21 [30]. The
lactonization of ketones 22 via a non-Baeyer–Villiger process using MeCN/water
as a cosolvent is described in Scheme 15.5c [31]. An essential step in the synthe￾sis of organic materials is the oxidation of alcohol. In order to electrooxidize alco￾hol 24 to the corresponding product ketone 26 in aqueous conditions, the Tanaka
group immobilized 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine N-oxyl (TEMPO) on a rigid net￾work polymer (PBZTNT-N-Oxyl) 25 (Scheme 15.5d) [32].(a)

15.6.5 Electrochemical Reduction in Aqueous Media
A moderate yield of Birch reduction of electron-rich arenes such as anisole 27
to the corresponding product 28 was reported in 1983 by the Kariv–Miller group
using electrochemistry on aqueous media (Scheme 15.6a) [33]. The electrochemical
hydrogenation of dimethyl maleate 29 was reported by the Tajima group in 2013.
Amberlite IR-120, an immobilized sulfonic acid, was utilized as the proton source
in this protocol (Scheme 15.6b) [34]. Process development, including cathodic
reduction in the aqueous phase, demonstrates the benefit of the OER reaction. For
the pilot product of 3-exomethylene-7-(R)-glutaroylaminocepham-4-carboxylic acid
1-(S)-oxide 32 from substrate 31, Chai et al. set up a 1,3-reductive de-acetylation
reaction (Scheme 15.6c) [35].

15.6.6 Emulsion Electrooxidation in Aqueous Media
The Atobe group reported the direct conversion of amine 33 to nitrile 34 by the use
of the electrochemical method (Scheme 15.7a) [36]. In 2022, the same group estab￾lished a flow emulsion electrooxidation process using an undivided flow cell that
converted n-octylamine 33 to octanenitrile 34 (Scheme 15.7b) [37].
15.6.7 Electrochemical Polymerization in Aqueous Media
Oligo(ethylene oxide) methyl ether methacrylate (OEOMA) polymerization in an
undivided cell with an Alsacrificial anode wasreported (Scheme 15.8a). The catalyst
is destroyed by protonated amine ligands when the pH of the aqueous electrolyte is
lowered by the Al3+ cation. The ideal solution for the precipitation of Al(OH)3 is a15.6 Organic Transformations in Water: Principles and Applications 305

buffersolution that is neutral[38]. Likewise, the electrochemicalsynthesis of pinacol
product 38 from benzaldehyde 37 in water was reported by the Zhang group in 2021
(Scheme 15.8b) [39].
15.6.8 Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation (ECH)
Water is an effective solvent in the reaction known as ECH of unsaturated
compounds. In this strategy, the ECH of platform chemicals produced from
biomass, including furfural (Scheme 15.9a), has been highlighted [41]. It has been306 15 Organic Electrocatalysis in Water

demonstrated that the catalyst material and the electrolysis conditions have a
significant impact on the selectivity of the conversion of 39 into the potential hydro￾genation products 40–43. In an aqueous acidic solution (pH = 2.9), 39 can be selec￾tively transformed to 2-methylfuran 42 by using CuPd particlessupported on carbon
as catalysts. However, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol 41 was found to be selectively
produced in a Pd membrane reactor (Scheme 15.9b), where a hydrogen-permeable
Pd foil acts as a separator between the electrochemical processes in aqueous 1 M
H2SO4 and the chemical hydrogenation in organic media, as well as a catalyst for
ECH [40]. The benefits of this approach include significant flexibility in selecting
the solvent for hydrogenation while employing water as the hydrogen source
and exceptional selectivity for ECH at high current densities. Hydrodimeriza￾tion to hydrofuroin is one potential side reaction that could happen under ECH
conditions 44 [41].
15.6.9 Examples of Electrochemical Processes in Mixture of Water
and Other Solvents
The Terent’ev group claimed in 2021 that they had synthesized bromohy￾drins using an electrochemical technique from alkenes and inorganic bromide
(Scheme 15.10a) [42]. Apart from the widely recognized bromonium pathway, a
particular DMSO-Br+ pathway similar to that documented by Yoshida was sug￾gested as an effective path to the target product [43]. In 2019, Xu et al. revealed that
under anodic oxidation conditions, CF2HSO2NHNHBoc served as the precursor for
the difluoromethylation of α,β-unsaturated compounds 47 (Scheme 15.10b) [44].
Ackermann and his coworkers disclosed the production of aminated heteroarenes

15.7 Benefits of Electrochemical Conversions
Several benefits can be achieved through the electrochemical conversion of natu￾rally occurring substances in a water environment. Biogenic compounds, which are
found in living organisms, typically dissolve well in water because they have a polar
nature. This means they can easily undergo electrochemical reactions in watery
environments [46]. Valeric acid is soluble in water, but n-octane, the product of the
reaction, is not. So, after the reaction, the n-octane forms a separate layer on top of
the water, making it easy to collect and separate the desired product. This concept
has been known for a long time and is now being applied in the context of electro￾fuel synthesis. In electrochemical hydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation reactions
in water, various transformations can occur. For example, you can turn levulenic
acid 52 into valeric acid 53 or muconic acid 54 into trans-3-hexenedioic acid 55
(Scheme 15.11a,b). An example of integrating microbial and electrochemical con￾versions is making methylsuccinic acid 57 from glucose using a fungus and electric￾ity via an intermediate itaconic acid 56 (Scheme 15.11b) [47]. These products have
potential uses in making things like special types of plastics and biofuels. Biomass
usually has water in it, and it would take a lot of energy to get rid of this water, for
example, by drying it. Using water as part of the process, instead of trying to get rid
of it, lowersthe amount of energy needed and makesthe whole thing cheaper. Many
possible sources of biogenic materials are called “waste” because they have diluted,
complex, and mixed-up organic matter. Organic electrosynthesisis a way to use these
materials and make them more valuable. Waldvogel and coworkers showed how to
turn Kraft-lignin 58, which is a waste product from making paper, into vanillin 59,
which is a valuable taste ingredient (Scheme 15.11c) [48]. This shows how organic
electrosynthesis can turn thingsthat used to be thrown away into thingsthat are use￾ful. It has been reported that benzimidazole 62 can be formed in an aqueoussolution
by a very efficient electrochemical decarboxylative coupling of o-phenylenediamine
61 with α-keto acid 60 (Scheme 15.11d). Pharmaceutical agents, natural goods, and
functional materials all rely on benzoimidazoles as a fundamental component. This
reaction protocol is friendly and easy to operate [49].
15.8 Conclusion
This chapter introduces the role of electrocatalysis in water. In addition, a brief
overview of the basic concepts that are necessary to comprehend and explore
organic electrosynthesis in aqueous media is provided. Furthermore, it examines a
range of applications and explores current research developments in this domain.
Aqueous reduction and oxidation reactions are facilitated by water, which is
the most convenient safe source of hydrogen and oxygen. An additional force
accelerating the reactions is the availability of the HER and OER reactions in water.
Furthermore, one potential characteristic should be the high surface tension that
organic compounds experience when exposed to water.310 15 Organic Electrocatalysis in Water
15.9 Future Perspectives
Over the coming decades, a crucial and fruitful area of research will be the under￾standing of the mechanisms behind organic electro-syntheses in aqueous reaction
media, as well as the identification of new and previously identified syntheses for a
bio-based economy [50]. The utilization of electricity for chemical transformations,
which often entail laborious procedures and the usage of a certain amount of
reagents, has introduced a novel pathway in the realm of catalysis. The subject
of electrosynthesis is advancing through the incorporation of novel concepts and
methodologies from other disciplines, including magneto-electrochemistry and
ultrasonication. Furthermore, continuous innovation in electrolyte and electrode
systems is necessary to overcome the limitations of existing electrode materials,
such as mercury and lead. An ideal electrode system in current timesshould possess
corrosion resistance and exhibit a significant overpotential to minimize undesirable
side reactions. It is important to thoroughly investigate solvents, not only as a reac￾tion medium, but also as a means to control selectivity in the electrosynthetic route.
The viability of electrochemical processes could lead to their widespread adoption
as a conventional synthetic technique, rather than a specialized technology [51].
In the last 15 years, density functional theory has been increasingly popular
in electrocatalysis research. Therefore, new methods for investigating solva￾tion/electrification effects or probing ion transfer paths in basic electrochemical
steps could be obtained by combining DFT, with its special ability to examine bond
breaking and forming at the electrocatalyst surface, with force-field approaches
that can handle the longer length and time scales of electrolyte dynamics.

16.1 Introduction
The use of visible light to promote organic transformations has become a well￾consolidated approach to chemical and material synthesis [1]. In photoredox catal￾ysis, these reactions imply the excitation of a (photo)catalyst able to harvest light
energy and reach an electronically excited state, which can further promote either
the oxidation or the reduction of a suitable radical precursor (e.g. via single-electron
transfer (SET) events). Alternative common mechanistic pathways can involve the
formation of electron donor–acceptor (EDA) complexes, energy transfer (EnT),
hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis, and proton-coupled electron transfer
(PCET). All these pathways can be more or lessinfluenced by the reaction solvent as
the latter not only can determine, as obvious, the solubility of the starting materials,
but also can affect the energies between the electronic states of a light-absorbing
substrate according to what is defined as solvatochromic effects [2]. In this context,
water, the solvent of Life, has attracted increasing interest as a reaction medium for
photochemical transformations [3]. It has been shown that water can enhance the
reductive power of metal-based photocatalysts, promote reductive proton transfer
and the LUMO-lowering effect(lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), and influence
chemoselectivity and reaction rates, thus unlocking unique and unconventional
reactivities [3]. According to Prof. Kobayashi and coworker [4] and Prof. Lipshutz
and coworkers [5], a conceptual classification of the current literature can rely on
three main groups: (i) in-water reactions, i.e. reactions involving substrates soluble
in water (ia: water-soluble catalyst; ib: catalyst not soluble in water); (ii) in-water
reactions involving the use of additives to achieve solubilization of the substrates
such as micelles-forming surfactants (iia and iib depending on the solubility of
the catalyst); and (iii) on-water reactions, occurring when the substrates are not
water-soluble (iiia–c, with iiia referred to reactions involving a soluble catalyst). The
second class can also be extended to “artificial enzymes” or “chemzymes”, defined

as water-soluble macromolecules able to host a non-polar guest in a hydrophobic
cavity, which include cyclodextrines, antibodies, nanomaterials, dendrimers, and
other disperse interface-rich structures [6]. The third class is probably the most
interesting one with current ongoing studies focused on understanding how bulk
properties of water such as polarity and viscosity, solute-water interactions at the
microscopic level, as well as both nonspecific (e.g., Coulombic and van der Waals)
and specific (e.g., hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic) interactions, could influence the
reaction kinetics and overall outcome. On-water reactions indeed can occur either
at interfaces such as catalyst–water, substrate(s)-water, catalyst-substrate(s)-water,
or, according to the Marcus model [7], at an oil–water interface, when hydrophobic
interactions of the starting materials lead to the formation of suspensions or
emulsions. However, the study of the exact phenomena underlying the mechanism
of rate acceleration at aqueous interfaces still remains a complex task, also due to
the implication of multiple different effects, thus representing a field of intense
research. The last paragraph of this chapter will briefly mention photobiocatalytic
approaches harnessing the combination of enzymatic reactions with light-promoted
transformations.
16.2 In-Water Reactions
As a matter of fact, a strict classification of in-water reactions is not possible due
to poor information about the exact solubility of the reactants; such reactions have
indeed been reported “in water” even when involving slightly or not soluble starting
materials. Accordingly, this section will focus on those transformations involving,
at least, water-soluble photocatalysts as well as reactions where the solubilization of
the starting materialsis achieved by means of additivesinvolving, but not limited to,
micelles-forming surfactants.
16.2.1 Soluble Photocatalysts
Most metal-based photoredox catalysts exhibit poor solubility in water (from
<1 to 1000 ppm), which can be tuned in some cases by the substitution pattern
and the anionic partner [8]. In this context, Roelfes and coworkers [9] and
Conrad and coworkers [10] have shown that homogeneous conditions can be
achieved by using water-soluble iridium photoredox catalysts where the dative
ligands of [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)]PF6 have been replaced by either quater￾nary ammonium groups or carboxylic acid residues, respectively. The use of
[Ir(dF(CF3)-ppy)2(dNMe3bpy)]Cl3 (Scheme 16.1a) led to a synthetic protocol to
modify dehydroalanine (Dha) residues in peptides and proteins, which is performed
in water and under physiologically relevant conditions [9], while the introduction
of carboxylic acid moieties on the bipyridyl ligand led to catalyst 2 (Scheme 16.1b)
applied to the trifluoromethylation of acyl tyrosine amide and an unprotected
dipeptide Asp-Tyr 1 in phosphate-buffered saline solvent (DPBS) [10].16.2 In-Water Reactions 315

A relevant example of a water-soluble organophotocatalyst, i.e. alizarin red
S, was reported by Wu and coworkers for the bromination and iodination of
8-aminoquinoline amides in water [11]. On the other hand, Romero, Teixidor and
coworkers showed how very low loadings of metallacarboranes systems such as
[Co(C2B9H11)2]
− were effective to promote the oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic
alcohols as well as the oxidation of alkenes to epoxides (conversions between 65%
and 97% in short reaction times of 15 minutes and excellent chemo-selectivities)
[12, 13]. Interestingly, such metallacarborane could also be easily recycled by
covalently linking it to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), as proved in the pho￾tooxidation of alcohols [14]. More recently, the same authors were able to exploit
noncovalent interactions—persistent even after water dissolution—between
[RuII(trpy)(bpy)(H2O)] (trpy = terpyridine and bpy = bipyridine) and the pho￾toredox metallacarborane [3,3-Co(1,2-C2B9H11)2]2 to develop a catalytic system
to photooxidize alcohols to aldehydes and carboxylic acids via a proton-coupled
electron-transfer process under UV light irradiation and with a 0.005 mol % of
catalyst loading [15].
In this context, the selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes was achieved by
Wang and coworkers by using mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-CN), a
metal-free polymeric photocatalyst [16], endowed with high tunability for a wide
range of parameters. Albeit requiring a biphasic solvent system to be recycled, one316 16 Visible Light Photocatalysis in Water
more example worthy of note relies on a cobalt-based phthalocyanine photoredox
catalyst [CpPc-(SO3Na)4], whose efficacy was proved by Baskar and coworkers in
the oxidative dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles such as tetrahydro-β-carbolines,
indolines, and tetrahydro-(iso)-quinolines [17].
16.2.2 Addition of Solubilizing Agents
16.2.2.1 Photomicellar Catalytic Systems
Micellar catalysis, pioneered by Prof. Lipshutz, represents a consolidated approach
enabling the use of water-based reaction media when the reactants are not
hydrophilic enough to get homogeneous conditions in such systems [18]. In the
context of photoredox catalysis, the same Prof. Lipshutz in 2018 reported the design
and the synthesis of an iridium photocatalyst covalently linked to polyethyleneg￾lycol ubiquinol succinate (PQS), a reduced form of dietary supplement CoQ10,
able to undergo self-aggregation in water into nanomicelles [19]. The PQS-[Ir]
photocatalyst was efficient in a pool of representative transformations, including
the difunctionalization of alkenes 4 and the sulfonylation of enol acetates 7
(Scheme 16.2). While the main advantage of this system is the easy recyclability of
the catalyst in the same reaction flask (up to ten times without losses in the yield),
the need for a preliminary synthesis of photoredox catalysts endowed with different
redox potentials and covalently linked to surfactants limits its broad application.
Accordingly, most of the literature reports rely on the combination of common both
metal-based and organic photoredox catalysts with aqueous micellar solutions such
as TPGS-750M, Triton-X, SDS, and CTAC, to cite a few. Representative protocols
involve arylation reactions with diazonium ions generated in situ by using eosin B in
a 2 wt % Triton-X solution [20]; direct arylations of aryl bromides in a microfluidic
reactor by exploiting an association colloid formed by castor oil derivative Kolliphor
EL (K-EL) and a specifically devised photoredox active surfactant (S-PTh) [21];
the aromatization of 1,4-dihydropyridines to pyridines in an aqueous solution of
Triton-X [22] as well as the C−H functionalization of heteroarenes in SDS micellar
aqueous solution [23].

Often, the photomicellar conditions proved to afford higher yields while enabling
to either avoid or reduce stoichiometric radical promoters, oxidants, and acids as16.2 In-Water Reactions 317
additives. In some other cases, the same reaction performed in acetonitrile does not
afford the product, thus highlighting the critical importance of microstructuring the
components in the reaction medium. Even more interestingly, the use of an anionic
surfactant rather than a cationic one can drive the chemoselectivity toward the for￾mation of different products: this is the case of o-chlorobenzamides 10, which could
lead to either intramolecular C–H arylation or N-dealkylation depending on the use
of a CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) or an SDS (sodium dodecylsulfate)
micellarsolution, respectively [24] (Scheme 16.3). We recently showed that the eval￾uation of the polarity charge of both the photocatalyst and the surfactant could be
key to figuring out optimal photomicellar catalytic conditions [25]. More in detail,
solution 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments performed in the presence of paramagnetic
probes enabled the investigation of the reaction environment at the atomic level,
i.e. the localization of the photocatalyst with respect to the micelles. In our specific
case, we developed a synthetic protocol to get amides from isocyanides and tertiary
aromatic amines using [Ir(ppy)2bpy]PF6 in a 2 wt % SDS water solution.

What we observed could be defined as a reverse polarity principle, providing the
localization of a positively charged photocatalyst on the surface of a negatively
charged surfactant such as SDS. Such a condition could indeed enhance the
solubilization of the photocatalyst by keeping the interactions with the micelles
on their surface, thus exposed to light irradiation. In the case of photocatalytic
methods, indeed, the “nanoreactor” model, generally acknowledged to explain
the efficiency of the micellar medium, poses some concerns about the ability
of the light to penetrate deep inside the micelles and reach the reactants. SDS
micelles were also shown to be an optimum solvent system to promote, via
2-aminoanthracene irradiation at 355 nm, the formation of hydrated electrons
acting as “super-reductants” in the dimerization of chloro-organic substrates [26].
As an alternative to common surfactants, several organic transformations could
harness amphiphilic polymeric nanoparticles incorporating organic photocatalysts
such as phenothiazines and acridinium dyes [27, 28] and colloidal platinum
nanoparticles dispersed by poly-vinylpyrrolidone [29].318 16 Visible Light Photocatalysis in Water
16.2.2.2 Use of Additives Other Than Surfactants
Homogeneous reaction conditions in water can also be achieved by means of
chaotropic agents (e.g., urea and guanidinium salts) able to enhance the water
solubility of hydrophobic particles, whereas kosmotropic additives, exemplified by
sodium chloride, are known to favor the aggregation of such lipophilic substrates
by decreasing their water solubility [30]. The origin of the terms, from Greek chaos
and kosmo, would highlight the ability of the additives to induce and stabilize
“disorganization” and “organization,” respectively, of the hydrogen bond network
of pure water. In the first case, such a disorganization would promote the solvation
of a hydrophobic substrate, whereas favoring the organization of such polar inter￾actions between water molecules would lead to further repulsion of the non-polar
substrate. Albeit such definitions have been indicated as misleading, these agents
are commonly exploited for the proteins’ purification in salting-in/salting-out
methods [31]. In the context of photocatalysis, very recently, Prof. König reported
the use of meglumine, a sugar alcohol derived from sorbitol and used as phar￾maceutical excipient [32, 33], as an effective solubilizing agent to promote EDA
complex formation between haloarenes, as electron-poor species, and indoles,
anilines, anisoles, or thiols as electron donors [34] (Scheme 16.4). Importantly, the
same transformations did not occur in organic solvents, thus highlighting how the
water effects are key to promoting EDA complex formation as well as enhancing its
stability. This elegant report was the first to address the study of EDA complexes in
water, which, being by definition species arising from aggregation, are expected to
exhibit low solubility. The authorsreported 91 C–C and C–S cross-coupling products
formed upon reductive fragmentation of haloarenes, followed by radical–radical
coupling and proton loss (Scheme 16.4).

16.3 On-Water Reactions
According to Prof. Kobayashi, heterogeneous mixtures of insoluble reactants
undergoing accelerated conversion to products can be defined as on-water reactions
[4]. Albeit the original term was used by Prof. Sharpless for catalyst-free reactions
[35], the current amount of data available in the literature led to extending this
definition to all the reactions occurring at interfaces with water and showing16.3 On-Water Reactions 319
dramatic acceleration with respect to common organic solvents. The Kobayashi
model proposes a further classification based on the behavior of the water layer.
Water molecules can indeed: (i) be oriented to extrude protons toward the oily
phase in the inner layer, (ii) be enwrapped by a secondary layer, (iii) form a bulk
water layer. Due to the lack of sufficient data, it is unrealistic to base a definition
on the solubility of the reactants. Accordingly, a more convenient approach is
based on the achievement of “on-water” like acceleration [36], where it has been
shown that only one equivalent of water could be enough to gain such an advantage
[37]. Accordingly, this class of reactions is not limited to those involving lipophilic
substrates forming aggregates and appearing as aqueous suspensions, but can also
be extended to “in-water” reactions exploiting “on-water” effects.
16.3.1 Catalytic Roles of Water as a Solvent for the Acceleration
of Reaction Rates
As for photochemical and photoredox catalytic synthetic methods, it is common to
find procedures where optimum conditions are achieved by adding water (either
a few equivalents or precise volume ratios) to the reaction medium based on an
organic solvent (either miscible or not). Unfortunately, most such synthetic pro￾tocols do not report sufficient data about the reason(s) for the beneficial effect of
water. In some cases, the addition of water can be useful to achieve homogeneous
conditions by increasing the solubilization of a complex reaction mixture involv￾ing a photocatalyst and one or more inorganic base/additive(s). In this context, the
deboronative cyanation reaction to give products 19 starting from trifluoroborate
salts 17 (Scheme 16.5) and promoted by a ruthenium-based photocatalyst, a hyperva￾lent iodine oxidant, a cyanide source 18, and TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) as an additive
can be considered a representative example [38].

Here, the dissolution of the different reactants/reagents was achieved with a
biphasic 1 : 1 DCM/H2O solvent system, whereas 2 : 1 mixtures of organic solvents
(acetone/DCM and HFIP/DCM) led to poorer outcomes. Some other reports exploit
the catalytic role of water and water-based species (such as H3O+) in promoting
cycloaddition reactions, asshown by Prof. Rueping in the synthesis of isoxazolidines
[39]. Homogeneous conditions can be advantageous when the unique features of
water in forming hydrogen bonds are effective in the modification of key properties
of the reactants, such as their redox potential. Such an effect has been described,
for example, by Prof. Zeitler, who showed how the addition of water induces a320 16 Visible Light Photocatalysis in Water

(Ered = −1.72V in MeCN vs. SCE [saturated calomel electrode]), by increasing their
redox potential to −1.54V vs. SCE [40]. Such an effect was further enhanced with
a water-compatible Lewis acid such as Nd(OTf)3 (Ered = −1.27V vs. SCE for the
carbonyl substrate in the presence of the LA).
16.3.2 Exploitation of Non-Solvent Properties of Water
The nonsolvent properties of water, referred to as lipophilic hydrophobic additives
and/or reagents, can be a key to achieving a high degree of chemoselectivity, as
shown by Jui and coworkers for the radical conjugate addition of nitrogen hete￾rocycles 23 to electron-poor alkenes 24 (Scheme 16.7a) [41]. The authors reported
how the addition of increasing amounts of water spanning from 0% to 33% to DMSO
(dimethyl sulfoxide) led to decrease the solubility of the Hantzsch ester, herein used

as a hydrogen atom donor, thus improving the selective formation of the Michael
addition products 25 over the formation of the reduced nitrogen heterocycles 26
(Scheme 16.7a). A similar solvent effect, albeit less intuitive, was reported by Qing
and coworkers in the chemoselective synthesis of hydro- and dibromofluoromethy￾lated adducts 29 from alkenes 27 and dibromofluoromethane 28 (Scheme 16.7b)
[42]. Here, the use of THF (tetrahydrofuran) as both a solvent and a hydrogen atom
source led to the exclusive formation of hydro-bromofluoromethylated products,
while the switch to a 1 : 4 DMF/H2O solvent system completely suppressed their
formation, affording products 29 in high yields. In such a case, the role of water in
promoting the chemoselectivity is unclear, asthe use of the sole DMF (N,N-dimethyl
formamide) as the solvent still afforded a mixture of both hydro- and dibromofluo￾romethylated products. More or less pronounced solvation effects of reaction inter￾mediates/products could account for the observed chemoselectivity.
Besides these reports about mixtures of water and organic solvents, a break￾through approach to use pure water as a solvent system has very recently
been described by Prof. König in the C(sp2)–N, C(sp2)–O, C(sp2)–S, C(sp2)–Se
(Scheme 16.8) and C(sp3)–C(sp2) coupling reactions via EDA complex formation
[43]. The authors showed that the melting point depression of solid mixtures can
form an oil phase where the hydrophobic interactions with water can further
promote the aggregation of the substrates leading to both EDA complex formation
and stabilization. The formation of an oily thin film enables maximum engagement
of the active hydrogen atoms of the reactants in hydrogen bonds with water at the
interface, thus leading to a dramatic acceleration of the photochemical transfor￾mations. The latter, being selected as reactions not occurring in common organic
solvents, enabled the acknowledgment of the huge potentiality of photochemical
transformations at the water interface.

16.4 Photobiocatalysis
Photobiocatalysis could be defined as an intense research area aiming at the
combination of the unique chemical features of photocatalysis and enzymatic
reactions in terms of chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selectivities [44]. Moreover, such322 16 Visible Light Photocatalysis in Water
a field superbly addresses the challenge of sustainable production of chemicals, as
enzymes stand for biodegradable catalysts. Reactions are usually run in water-based
media, at room temperature or slightly above, and at atmospheric pressures. Such
a section would provide the reader with a general overview of the mechanistic
differences between the currently available photobiocatalytic approaches, while the
readershould referto specific review articlesfor a more comprehensive treatment of
the state-of-the-art. According to Prof. Hyster [44], light can be used in biocatalysis
by exploiting four main strategies: (i) in photoenzymatic catalysis, a cofactor within
the protein active site is photoexcited to promote electron or EnT that triggers the
conversion of a substrate into a product, (ii) synergistic photoenzymatic catalysis
relies on the excitation of an exogenous cofactorto enable a chemical transformation
within a protein active site, (iii) tandem photocatalyst/enzyme reactions, where
light is either used to regenerate a cofactor or to provide, via photoexcitation, the
conversion of a reactant into a substrate suitable for the biocatalytic process, (iv) the
fourth class involves enzymatic reactions coupled to natural photosynthesis. All
these reactions are usually performed in aqueous buffers, often (but not always)
requiring an organic co-solvent (typically 5–30%) to achieve optimum conversions,
yields, selectivities, and turn-over numbers of the enzyme.
16.4.1 Photoenzymatic Catalysis
There are currently only three examples of photoenzymes known in nature: a DNA
photolyase able to repair pyrimidine cyclobutane dimersin DNA and lesionsformed
upon UV light irradiation of DNA [45]. The repair process occurs thanks to the
photoexcitation of the reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor (FADhq
− )
in the active site of the enzyme. Interestingly, homologous enzymes endowed with
deazaflavin or pterin cofactors enable the use of alternative wavelengths [45]. A
second class of natural photoenzyme is the protochlorophyllide reductase, where
the reduction occurs via photoexcitation of the PChlide substrate rather than the
NADPH cofactor [46]. A third and well-exploited class is finally represented by
the fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), which promotes the hydrodecarboxylation
of fatty acids 33 to alkanes 34 in a redox-neutral reaction (Scheme 16.9) [47].

Mechanistically, the reaction is initiated by the photoexcitation of the FAD
cofactor to FAD* with visible light (𝜆 = 325−530 nm with 𝜆max = 467 nm), which16.4 Photobiocatalysis 323
promotes the oxidation of the carboxylate. The latter affords an alkyl radical
upon decarboxylation, while the termination step can occur either via HAT from
Cys432 or PCET from Arg451 as a proton source and FAD•− as the reductant. As
for the synthetic scope, FAPs are able to accommodate mono- and di-carboxylic
acids from C12 to C22 to afford Cn−1 alkanes. Other classes of photoenzymes
involve: nicotinamide-dependent ketoreductases (KREDs), flavin-dependent
“ene”-reductases (EREDs), flavin-dependent Baeyer–Villiger monooxigenases
(BVMs), and flavin-dependent photoenzymes for radical polymerization [44a].
These enzymes are well-known classes of biocatalysts, sometimes with wide and
consolidated applications in synthesis, but their combination with light-mediated
processes has further expanded their scope. For example, in the case of KREDs the
group of Prof. Hyster demonstrated that the reducing power of the NADH/NADPH
cofactors could be enhanced, and, as exemplified for the hydrodehalogenation
of α-bromolactones, the formation of a charge-transfer (CT) complex with the
cofactor inside the catalytic site of the protein could lead to a photoactive sub￾strate (𝜆max = 390 nm), which is exclusively excited in a chiral environment
(i.e. the enzyme catalytic site), thus leading to a stereoselective reaction [48].
16.4.2 Synergistic Photoenzymatic Catalysis
Synergistic photoenzymatic catalysis involves enzymatic transformations relying
on electron or EnT from an exogenous photocatalyst to a substrate or cofactor
within the protein active site [44]. This family of reactions encloses two subfamilies
based on native and non-natural reactivity, respectively. The first class covers
cytochromes P450 (the most widely used being P450BM3) and Rieske-type non-heme
iron enzymes: the bioconjugation with small molecules of photocatalysts, either
metal-based polypyridyl complexes or organic ones such as Eosin Y and Rose
Bengal, proved to be beneficial for the yield and the total turn-over number, thus
improving the overall catalytic activity. In the second class of reactions involving
nicotinamide- and flavin-dependent enzymes, an exogenous photocatalyst enables
non-native mechanisms, where the electron transfer events are exclusively pro￾moted by the photocatalyst and the enzyme provides a chiral environment for the
desired transformation. In this case, the major challenge to address is avoiding
background reactions occurring outside the protein; optimized conditions should
hence favor the occurrence of the radical formation exclusively within the protein’s
active site. As a matter of example, Prof. Hyster reported the deacetoxylation of
α-acetoxyketones using a nicotinamide-dependent double-bond reductase and Rose
Bengal as a photocatalyst (87% yield, 93 : 7 e.r.) [49]: it is worth noting that the latter
conferred to the enzyme this catalytic activity, while in its absence the acetoxylation
could not occur.
16.4.3 Tandem Photocatalyst/Enzyme Reactions
In these transformations, the photocatalyst acts independently of the enzyme,
usually by reducing the cofactor or enabling in situ peroxide generation [44].
Alternatively, organic reactions promoted by light can be simply performed in the324 16 Visible Light Photocatalysis in Water
presence of the enzyme, whose role is to provide a dynamic kinetic resolution.
Light-driven cofactor regeneration occurs, for example, for “ene”-reductases,
BVMs, FAD-dependent halogenases, ketoreductases, cytochromes P450, and
peroxygenases. On the other hand, in photochemical/enzyme cascades, the two
reactions (i.e. the light-triggered and the enzymatic ones) can occur either simul￾taneously or in separate step, resulting in one-pot/one-step and one-pot/two-steps
reactions, respectively. In this context, the dynamic kinetic resolution of amines
35 by using lipases, an iridium-based photocatalyst, and thiyl radicals for substrate
racemization, very well exemplifies the concept of one-pot/one-step cascades, albeit
performed by using pure acetonitrile as a solvent (Scheme 16.10) [50].

In a typical one-pot/two-step reaction, instead, the photocatalyst promotes the
conversion of a starting material(not elaborated by the enzyme) into a substrate suit￾able for the enzymatic catalytic step. For example, Schmidt and coworkers achieved
an asymmetric C–H oxyfunctionalization of alkanes 37, 40, and 43 by photocatalyt￾ically oxidizing the latter to aldehydes and ketones 38, which are then selectively
converted to chiral alcohols 39 and 41, amines 42, hydroxynitriles 44, and acyloins
45 in up to 99% e.e. (Scheme 16.11) [51].
16.4.4 Enzymatic Reactions Coupled to Natural Photosynthesis
The development of this class of reactions aims at improving the poor atom effi￾ciency of cofactorregeneration, which affects oxidoreductases, the most widely used
enzymes for the synthesis of small organic compounds (alcohol dehydrogenases,
enereductases, amine dehydrogenases, and oxygenases). This issue represents a
major drawback forthe application of biocatalytic methods on scale, i.e. to industrial
synthesis. Typically, such reactions require stoichiometric amounts of reductants
such as glucose, 2-propanol, and formate, producing equimolar byproducts, which
have to be disposed of. A strategy to overcome these limitations, for example, comes
from coupling the enzymatic redox process to a photosystem in cyanobacteria that
produces NADPH, that can be used as a reductant by the enzyme. It has been
shown that such an approach can be harnessed with biocatalysts both native to
cyanobacteria and heterologously expressed [44].16.5 Summary and Conclusions 325

16.5 Summary and Conclusions
In conclusion, the development of photochemical and photoredox catalytic syn￾thetic procedures using water as a reaction medium represents a promising field
of research. Water indeed can promote unique reactivity patterns in terms of
chemoselectivities and provide significant reaction rate acceleration, while regio￾and stereo-specific requirements can be addressed by merging light-activated
pathways with enzymatic catalysis. The literature selected in the present chapter
highlights how both the solvent and non-solvent properties of water can be valuable
tools to drive organic transformations toward the clean and high-yielding formation
of the desired products. In particular, the non-solvent effects can promote substrate
aggregation into oily phases, which can enable charge transfer complexes’ formation
and stabilization via hydrogen bonds at the oil–water interface. On the other hand,
homogeneous conditions for complex reaction mixtures involving, for example,
a photocatalyst, a metal-based co-catalyst, additives (either sacrificial electron
donors or acceptors, final oxidants, etc.) can be achieved by exploiting water as
a co-solvent. The opportunities that emerged from the current state-of-the-art in
the development of light-driven methods in aqueous environments will definitely
trigger further studies in the field, contributing to solving the main challenge of a
sustainable production of drugs and materials.326 16 Visible Light Photocatalysis in Water

Industrial Applications of Organic Reactions in Water

17.1 Introduction
Water is the nature’s solvent. Aqueous media are a crucial interface between chem￾istry and biology. Even though chemical reactions in aqueous media emphasize the
existence of life, water is the worst enemy for synthetic organic chemists, due to the
fact that most of the catalysts and reagents have moisture sensitivity which reduces
the yield of products and obliterate reproducibility. Such chemical reactions must
require organic solvents as medium to enhance their reactivity and stabilize the
intermediatesformed during the chemicalreactions[1]. Despite the fact that organic
solvents have toxicity issues such as mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity,
and/or nephrotoxicity, still organic solvents dominate the method developments in
various aspects. Unlike biomolecules, most of the reactants and catalysts are insol￾uble in water; some organic reactions require dry organic solvents to stabilize the
reaction intermediates as well as to avoid the side product formations by chang￾ing the reaction pathway. Such types of reactions require water only in the course
of workup procedure to wash the reaction mixture [2]. In general, the operations of
organic solvents are also risky due to their flammability, explosivity, and their trans￾portation, and/or storage [3].
An organic reaction in water medium has been known for over a century; indeed,
it was preferred by Diels and Alder to perform their well-known [4+2] addition
of maleic anhydride with furan [4]. Later, many groups developed and organized
assemblies such as micelles, cavitands, and organic and inorganic hosts to solubi￾lize organic molecules in water for those reactions which do not occur in water
[5, 6]. Further,recent publication from Sharpless and coworkersreported “on-water”
reactions between two molecules that are not dissolved but suspended in water [7].
Consequently, the two types of “in-water” and “on-water” reactions expanded to all
types of molecules that are insoluble and remain as aggregates in bulk water and
to those that are insoluble but remain suspended at the interface involving water
as a component. Based on the above observations, numerous synthetically useful
reactions in aqueous medium were reported recently [8].

As we know, water has been a preferred medium for biological reactions and very
advantageous in green method development due to its nontoxic, cheap, abundant,
and nonhazardous nature. Consequently, since last two decades, synthetic chemists
have paid much attention to carrying out the reactions in water [9–14]. Given the
current emphasis on organic reactions in water, it may be necessary for us to utilize
abundantly and freely available, nontoxic, and environmentally friendly water as
the medium to perform organic reactions.
Despite a wide variety of organic transformations in aqueous medium, here, we
have essentially described a few fundamental organic reactions facilitated in water
medium. The details are discussed in the following sections, such as oxidative
esterification of alcohols; oxidation of methylarenes; and bromination of arenes,
methylarenes, and olefins using green brominating reagent. On the otherhand,
“on-water”- and “in-water”-promoted synthesis and functionalization of hetero￾cyclic compounds with an unusual reaction rate acceleration are also represented.
17.2 Oxidative Esterification of Alcohols
The discriminatory oxidation of alcohol is one of the most important transforma￾tions in organic synthesis. Furthermore, significance and flexibility of the corre￾sponding carbonyl products are useful in chemical industries. Among all carbonyl
compounds, esters are one of the most abundant class of chemicals, frequently uti￾lized as fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, natural products, agrochemicals, and food
additives[15]. Plants and vegetable oils and their essential fatty acids have been used
as precursors in the chemical industry for their transformation into high-valued
functional chemicals and biofuels [16]. Generally, aliphatic monoesters found in
jojoba oil can be easily synthesized from the fatty acids and alcohols derived from
triacylglycerol oils [17]. Mainly, long-chain fatty esters were used in the preparation
of waxes for industrial applications [18].
Adimurthy and coworkers developed oxidative esterification of aliphatic primary
alcohols using environment-friendly reagents under aqueous acidic medium at
room temperature (Scheme 17.1). This transformation provided the conversion
of various primary alcohols in quantitative yields of the corresponding homo￾coupled esters. As per the conditions of Scheme 17.1, it doesn’t require column
chromatography for the separation of products, but simple extraction and removal
of the organic solvent provides good yields of pure products. The system has
advantages of metal-free conditions, elimination of multistep catalyst preparation
(under heterogeneous medium), and used commercially available reagents. The
reaction concludes that the oxidative esterification of aliphatic primary alcohols

with bromide and bromate couple in aqueous acidic medium at room temperature
is a modest process with a wide range of substrate scope for both aliphatic and
cyclic alcohols and obtained in excellent yields of the desired products [19].
17.3 Green Oxidation of Methylarenes to Benzoic Acids
with Bromide/Bromate in Water
The oxidation of methyl aromatics into their corresponding benzoic acids is
an important transformation in organic synthesis as these carbonyl derivatives
constitute versatile building blocks in pharmaceutical and polymer industries
[20]. A variety of oxidizing agents, such as KMnO4, CrO3, Na2Cr2O7, TiO2, NaIO4,
and HNO3, are available to effect this key transformation [21–25]. However, these
metallic reagents are often required in stoichiometric amounts, and these proce￾dures are associated with environmental pollution because of the large amounts of
hazardous metallic waste generation. Despite the availability of several methods for
the transformation of methyl arenes to aromatic carboxylic acids, the preparation
under mild conditions without the use of heavy metal catalysts and reduction of
waste is the desirable goal in light of technical, economical, and industrial aspects.
As a part of Adimurthy’s group activities to develop green procedures that avoid
the use of hazardous reagents [26], they developed a novel, heavy-metal-free, and
recyclable reagent system for the oxidation of methylarenes to their corresponding
benzoic acids using a bromide–bromate couple as reagent under mild conditions in
an open atmosphere with water as solvent (Scheme 17.2) [27].

In this transformation, the bromide is not consumed as such in the oxidation pro￾cess; both bromide–bromate ions ended up in the aqueous effluent as total bromide
ions, and they reoxidized a part of the bromide ion to bromate with the oxidizing
agents, such as NaOCl, to regenerate the reagent to its original form under ambient
conditions(Figure 17.1). Sodium chloride formed in the path ofregeneration caused
no problem in the oxidation reactions. The regenerated reagent was subsequently
used for the oxidation of methylarenes under similar conditions. For a representa￾tive example, 4-nitrotoluene was subjected to oxidation by this regenerated reagent
system with three consecutive cycles, and the results are the same as with the fresh
reagent.
In conclusion, they have developed a very simple and novel procedure for the
oxidation of methylarenes to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives using an
economical and easily accessible bromide–bromate couple as oxidizing reagent
system. The most significant and green feature of this methodology is the easy332 17 Industrial Applications of Organic Reactions in Water

operation in water and no use of hazardous organic solvents or toxic reagents. The
recyclability of the reagent also adds to its green merit. Thus, this cost-effective and
environmentally friendly procedure is a practical alternative to the existing reagents
and may find useful applications in academia as well as in industry.
17.4 Environment-Friendly Synthesis of Bromoxynil
and Iodoxynil
The majority of the reported methods for bromoxynil synthesis involve the use
of liquid bromine in progression [28, 29]. In spite of the industrial significance of
bromination process and the continually growing environmental concerns, the use
of elemental bromine for bromination reaction is still very common in industry as
well asin academia probably due to its easy availability, low cost, and lack of a better
alternative. Moreover, purification of the reaction products is often demanding and
laborious. By keeping it in mind, Adimurthy et al. developed a high atom-efficient
and environment-friendly synthesis of herbicides bromoxynil and iodoxynil using
bromide/bromate and iodide/iodate couple as halogenating reagent in water at
room temperature (Scheme 17.3) [30].

of the process make it attractive for the transformation of 4-hydroxybenzonitrile17.5 Synthesis of 2,6-Dibromo-4-Nitroaniline from 4-Nitroaniline in an Aqueous Medium 333
to bromoxynil and ioxynil in small-scale as well as large-scale applications for
commercial interest.
17.5 Synthesis of 2,6-Dibromo-4-Nitroaniline from
4-Nitroaniline in an Aqueous Medium
The significance of the bromo-products are well known, which were used as crucial
intermediates for the synthesis of various bioactive molecules in pharmaceutical
industries [31] and also used as azo-disperse dyes [32], flame retardants [33], pes￾ticides [34], and herbicides [35]. Particularly, 2,6-dibromo-4-nitroaniline (DBPNA)
is a very important intermediate used in the azo-disperse dye industry and in
the synthesis of star polyfluorenes which are useful in photovoltaic applications
[36]. In addition to the above industrial applications, the antifungal behavior of
this molecule made it a pharmaceutically important product [37]. DBPNA is a
main building block in the synthesis of NanoPutians [38]. Due to the important
applications of bromo compounds, a number of brominating reagents have been
developed by various groups. Among those reagents, despite its hazardous nature,
liquid bromine is a very traditional reagent for industrial manufacture of preferred
bromo-compounds. To overcome the hazardous and handling problems associated
with liquid bromine at large-scale utilities, Adimurthy and coworkers have intro￾duced a new concept of using liquid bromine intermediate, which consists of an
aqueous solution of 5 : 1 bromide–bromate mole ratios during the liquid bromine
recovery by cold process [39]. This 5 : 1 mole ratio of Br−/BrO3
− could be used
for various bromination reactions in combination with mineral acids and suitable
oxidants as desirable. Alternately, the 5 : 1 Br−/BrO3
− could be converted to 2 : 1
mole ratios using oxidants like sodium hypochlorite and can be used for aromatic
substitution reactions under aqueous conditions [40]. In other hand the slow
addition of mineral acid to the above aqueous solution containing 2 : 1 Br−/BrO3
−
salts, which generates hypobromous acid (BrOH) in situ, the generated BrOH is
responsible for various electrophilic substitution reactions.
Importantly, the method is an organic solvent-free process for the preparation of
DBPNA from 4-nitroaniline using 2 : 1 bromide–bromate salts under an aqueous
acidic medium at ambient conditions has been developed which is crucial interme￾diate in azo-disperse dyes synthesis [40]. The 2 : 1 bromide–bromate couple could
be obtained by mixing pure NaBr/NaBrO3 salts or by adjusting the 5 : 1 mole ratio of
NaBr/NaBrO3 (obtained in an aqueoussolution as an intermediate from the bromine
manufacture industry by a cold process) to 2 : 1 by the addition of a suitable oxidant.
After completion of the reaction, the product was purified by simple filtration and
washing with water. The aqueous acidic filtrate wasrecycled up to five times without
loss of purity and yield of the product. The method was extended to other aromatic
substrates.
Adimurthy et al. have described a convenient procedure for the quantitative syn￾thesis of 2,6-dibromo 4-nitro aniline from 4-nitroaniline using NaBr and NaBrO3
salts in aqueous acidic medium under ambient conditions without use of organic334 17 Industrial Applications of Organic Reactions in Water

solvent in the process (Scheme 17.4). The pure product could be obtained by sim￾ple filtration and washing with water without any further purification, which meets
the requirement of industrial applications as a dye intermediate. They suggest the
mode of addition of brominating reagent to the aqueous acidic 4-nitroaniline solu￾tion to get better yield and it helps to recycle the acidic filtrate. During the recycle
of filtrate, the dilution of water in the process does not affect either the yield or the
purity of the product. They also demonstrated the recyclability of the aqueous efflu￾ent in the process.
17.6 HBr–H2O2 for Regioselective Synthesis
of Bromohydrins and 𝛂-Bromoketones and Oxidation
of Benzylic/Secondary Alcohols to Carbonyl Compounds
in Aqueous Medium
In progress of sustainable, efficient, and selective catalysts for the oxidation of
alcohols to aldehydes is a fundamental goal in chemistry. During the recent
decades, manifold transition metal-catalyzed reactions have been discovered
which significantly improved the organic transformations. Notably, most of the
applications are based on complexes of precious metals, such as palladium [41],
platinum [42], gold [43], ruthenium [44], and other metal catalysts [45–49]. Also,
the (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO)-imidazolium salts are efficient
metal-free oxidants reported recently for the oxidation of various alcohols [50]. The
limited availability of these metals and their high prices makes it highly desirable to
search for more economical and environmentally friendly alternatives.In thisregard
Adimurthy’s group developed selective oxidation of various organic substrates using
various molor ratios of substrate and NaBrO3 to achieve desired oxidized products
(Oxidation of Thiols, Sulfides, and Benzylic/Secondary Alcohols into Disulfides,
Sulfoxides, and Aldehydes/Ketones) under ambient conditions [51]. Adimurthy’s
group further studied and showed that HBr–H2O2 can be regioselectively provided
bromohydrins and α-bromoketones from olefins and is effective for the selective17.6 HBr–H2O2 for Regioselective Synthesis of Bromohydrins and 𝛼-Bromoketones and Oxidation 335
oxidation of benzylic/secondary alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds
under mild conditions [52]. HBr–H2O2 is efficiently activated in water under mild
conditions, allowing the bromohydroxylation of various styrenes. HBr–H2O2 is
more economic and easier to handle and offers sufficiently high regioselectivity
(100%) for bromohydrin synthesis. Further activation of bromohydrin with a
catalytic amount of HBr (50 mol%) and H2O2 in water affords α-bromoketones in
moderate-to-good yieldsin a single step. Oxidation of benzylic/secondary alcoholsto
the corresponding carbonyl compounds has been achieved with the HBr (10 mol%)
and H2O2 efficiently in aqueous dioxane under ambient conditions (Scheme 17.5).

Scheme 17.5 Synthesis of bromohydrins, α-bromoketones, and benzylic/secondary
alcohols to carbonyl compounds.
The method described above (Scheme 17.5) is an efficient, selective, and environ￾mentally benign strategy for the synthesis of bromohydrins and α-bromoketones
using the HBr–H2O2 system in water under mild conditions. The combination of
HBr–H2O2 generates BrOH in situ, which is a good oxidizing as well as a brominating
reagent. The addition of BrOH across olefins provide the corresponding bromohy￾drin derivatives. The dibromo impurity generated during the bromohydrin synthesis
is selectively converted to bromohydrin by refluxing in water. This conversion is
possible only when the reaction is carried out in water but not in any organic sol￾vent media. Additionally, the HBr (0.7 equiv.) generated during the conversion of
bromohydrin to α-bromoketones is utilized to regain bromohydrin by charging a
fresh substrate under the conditions specified. Thus, this system generates abso￾lutely zero effluent, representing an environmentally benign process suitable for
industrial applications. Catalysis with HBr (10 mol%) is a highly well-organized and
selective method forthe oxidation of various benzylic alcoholsto aldehydes, and sec￾ondary alcohols to ketones in aqueous dioxane medium at room temperature. The
versatility of this method was applied to a range of styrenes to obtain bromohydrins
and α-bromoketones as well as for the selective oxidation of benzylic/secondary
alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds using simple reaction conditions to
get excellent yields of desired products, which makes this method facile, ideal, and
attractive synthetic tool.336 17 Industrial Applications of Organic Reactions in Water
17.7 Water-Mediated Synthesis of Imidazo[1,2-a]
Pyridines
Recently, water has been employed as a solvent-cum-catalyst for the construction of
various heterocycles [53, 54]. Aqueous reactions have been paying more attention
owing to the unique reactivity and selectivity observed that are difficult to achieve
in conventional organic solvents [55]. As we know, the organic substrates are gen￾erally insoluble in water, but reactions have been reported to proceed “on water” to
obtain the desired products [56, 57]. In continuation of Adimurthy’s group works
on the development of green and sustainable methods [58–60], they also reported
“water-mediated” synthesis of methyl imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines through intramolec￾ular hydroamination under metal-free conditions (Scheme 17.6).

similar conditions. They also used the same starting material for Ag-catalyzed
intramolecular aminooxygenation for the synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]-pyridine-3-
carbaldehydes in moderate-to-good yields in acetonitrile [66, 67]. To gain insight
into the reaction mechanism, they performed some control experiments with
deuterated water (Scheme 17.7). The starting substrate having free acetylene group
delivered terminal−CD3 substituent product, whereas phenyl acetylene substrate

Scheme 17.8 Mechanism for water-mediated intramolecular hydroamination.
In the first step, starting material bearing acidic protons undergoes fast deu￾terium exchange to yield the intermediate I (Scheme 17.8). Then, I undergoes
intramolecular hydroamination through 5-exo-dig cyclization [53] to produce the
vinyl intermediate II, incorporating a second deuterium in the process. Generally, II
being unstable undergoes the rearrangement shown in step 3 during which process
−CD3 is formed. It would be evident that, for acetylene substituted at the terminal
position, only two deuterium atoms can be incorporated as observed in scheme 17.7.
They summarized as N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)pyridin-2-amines underwent a clean
transformation to the corresponding methyl imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines without the
deliberate addition of any catalyst or reagent with simple water as the medium. The
desired products were obtained in 75−97% isolated yield. Studies with D2O helped
to shed light on their proposed mechanism of the reaction system.
17.8 Sulfenylation of N-Heteroarenes in Water (Rice
Cooking Method)
Many strategies were successfully engaged for the sulfenylation of imidazo[1,2-
a]pyridines; it required activators or catalysts, such as copper, iodine, peroxides,338 17 Industrial Applications of Organic Reactions in Water
and these reactions were only effective in organic solvents [68]. Recently, water has
been employed as a solvent-cum-catalyst for the construction of heterocycles [53].
Aqueous reactions have attracted much attention owing to their unique reactivity
and selectivity, which are difficult to achieve in conventional organic solvents [55].
Organic substrates are generally insoluble in water; however, reactions proceed “on
water” to obtain the desired products.
Adimurthy and coworkers developed a method for the catalyst-free C–H
sulfenylation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines by using sulfonothioates as an odorless
thioarylated reagent in aqueous medium (rice cooking method) (Scheme 17.9)
[69]. This procedure was employed for the sulfenylation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
with broad functional-group tolerance and was also extended to the sulfenylation
of indoles and imidazothiazoles. The sulfonothioates were activated exclusively
in aqueous medium rather than in an organic solvent, and the possibility of
the process for scale-up studies was also discussed. In conclusion, they devel￾oped an efficient strategy for the sulfenylation of various heterocycles, such
as imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, phenylbenzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles, and indole
derivatives, under catalyst-free, aqueous conditions with a high degree of functional
group tolerance. The scope of this method was extended to a variety of arene- and
alkane sulfonothioates, and the feasibility of performing the reactions at gram-scale
was also demonstrated.

17.9 Summary and Conclusions
In this chapter, we have described the water-mediated organic transformations
under different conditions. The chapter mainly focused on the industrially
important organic reactions carried out in aqueous medium, such as oxidative
esterifications, conversion of methyl arenes to corresponding arene carboxylic
acids. The preparations of herbicides and dye intermediate DBPNA under purely
aqueous medium were also described. The synthesis of bromhydrins or bromoke￾tones and selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to carbonyl compounds under
metal-free conditions were briefly discussed. Further, water-mediated synthesis of
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and their functionalizations are discussed. An analysis is
provided that enfolds both the “on-water” and “in-water” phenomena and water
plays a crucial role in each transformation.References 339
