Introduction
This book is about the molecules and neural cells, the neurons and glia, that 
make up the nervous system. And it’s about how neural cells communicate 
to produce all the functions that keep us alive and make us human. 
Neurobiologists can and do ask many questions about the nervous system, but 
here are five of the big ones:
» How are neurons and glial cells formed during development and what are 
their specialized functions?
» What does the human nervous system have in common with that of other 
animals and how does it differ?
» How do neurons combine electrical and chemical signaling to communicate 
with their targets?
» Which neurons, circuits, and mechanisms are involved in the functions of the 
nervous system, including movement, perception, survival, emotion, and 
cognition?
» What happens when things don’t go as planned or if there is injury, trauma, or 
dysfunction? How can disorders of the nervous system be treated?
Neurobiologists have some answers to all these questions. We know that neurons 
and glia are specialized cells with some functions specific to them and others 
similar to many cells on earth. We know that nervous systems have similar 
organizational themes and methods of communication across all animal species. 
On the other hand, the nervous systems of mammals and primates are vastly more 
complicated than those of invertebrates and cold-blooded vertebrates. We know 
that small genetic differences and life experiences can produce significant changes 
in development and behavior. Finally, we know that brains aren’t fixed but can 
undergo neuroplasticity — the basis of memory and recovery after injury.
This book attempts to explain in plain English how neurons and glial cells work, 
how they develop and comprise the nervous system, how neurons communicate 
with their targets, and how neural systems can produce complex movements and 
behavior, language, memory, thinking, and intelligence.2 Neurobiology For Dummies
About This Book
This new edition of Neurobiology For Dummies starts with basic concepts and builds 
on them. It first discusses neurons and glial cells and their origin and functions, 
then deals with basic brain anatomy arising from those neural cells. It introduces 
the mechanisms of communication involving electrical and chemical signaling. 
And it describes specialized systems for sensation, movement, and cognition.
The way this book is organized allows you to find the information you need 
quickly, whether you want to look up information on a neural dysfunction of a 
friend or relative who has Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, you want to find 
out what the brain’s thalamus actually does, or you want to know about mecha￾nisms involved in neuroplasticity.
Besides being a resource for any nonscientist inquisitive about the brain and ner￾vous system, this book may be a useful accompanying text for students in under￾graduate and graduate neurobiology courses because it’s both modular and 
functional. For example, many books talk about brain anatomy using massively 
long lists of obscurely named brain nuclei and tracts, but they don’t try to help 
you understand all these components as a functional system. Perception and 
behavioral neuroscience courses often neglect important aspects of cognitive pro￾cessing, while cognitive science texts often give you little information about how 
neural activity actually supports cognition. This book is different. This book uses 
plain language and some simple diagrams to show how neurons, glial cells, and 
important parts of the brain and nervous system function.
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you, the reader:
» You may be looking for information about a neurological disease or disorder, 
possibly affecting someone you know. You want access to this information 
quickly in easy-to-understand chunks.
» You may be taking a college or professional course that covers some aspect 
of brain function, but the course or the text for the course doesn’t provide 
enough background or specific information.
» You may be a beginning student in neuroscience, neurology, or neurosurgery 
who has already learned what’s in this book, but you need to look up the 
basics quickly, maybe to explain it to a layperson. (Warning: If your patients 
notice you rifling through a copy of this book before recommending treatment 
options, they might request a second opinion.)Introduction 3
Icons Used in This Book
We use icons in this book to help you find specific kinds of information. They 
include the following:
Anything marked with a Tip icon is a piece of information about an area of 
neurobiology that’s often misunderstood or easily confused.
The Remember icon highlights key concepts and principles that you need to 
remember to understand other areas of neurobiology. It also points out key stud￾ies that led to today’s current understanding of neurobiology. Sometimes pieces of 
research are just beautiful in their own right for their elegance and simplicity. 
Research info bits are nice to drop in conversations at parties — if you party with 
people nerdy enough to know a fair amount of neurobiology, at least.
The Technical Stuff icon is about a recent or surprising finding that isn’t neces￾sarily crucial to understand the concept but is interesting or counterintuitive in its 
own right. You can skip these paragraphs and get by just fine, but you may miss 
some of the more interesting products of research.

Welcome to the World 
of Neurobiology
What makes you you? Your brain, most people would answer. Then what 
is it about your brain that makes you you? The brain is made of neurons 
and glial cells. Worms and bees have brains with neurons and glia. So 
do dogs and chimpanzees. What about the brain distinguishes these animals from 
each other, and for that matter, one human from another? Is it more neurons, dif￾ferent neurons, special neural circuits? And what happens when these neurons, 
glia, and circuits are disrupted or dysfunctional?
Neurobiologists like the two of us want to answer these questions. Thousands of 
us at universities, research institutes, and pharmaceutical companies all over the 
world are working on these questions. We have many hypotheses and data sets. 
This book, in a way, is a progress report on the efforts.
Virtually all neurobiologists believe that intelligence comes from nervous systems 
that are broadly programmed by genes and fine-tuned by experience. Generally, 
the human genetic program creates a brain with more cortical neurons than other 
animals have, allowing for richer experience to produce a unique kind of cognition 
and intelligence.
Here we introduce you to the basics of neurobiology and give you a jumping-off 
point to use this book in understanding the human nervous system.

Starting with Neurobiology — Just 
the Basics
Neurobiology is the study of neurons, glia, and the nervous system. It involves 
many fields of study including physiology, anatomy, biochemistry, molecular 
biology, cognitive and behavioral psychology, and artificial intelligence. The basic 
goals of neurobiology are to describe how the nervous system operates in terms of 
what neurons and glial cells do, how they’re built, how they work, and what hap￾pens when their functions are disrupted.
Neurons are the detecting and signaling cells of the nervous system that use elec￾trical and chemical signaling to communicate. Glial cells are the supporting cells 
that provide metabolic, structural, and functional support.
EVOLVING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
Many of the DNA sequences, proteins, and reactions that exist in neurons and glia are 
similar to those in single-celled organisms. This apparent conservation of genes and 
biochemistry is an important argument for life having a common origin.
Cells have membranes that separate their insides from the external environment. 
Receptors embedded in the membrane enable cells to respond to external signals. 
Receptor responses include biochemical cascades inside the cell, and, in neurons 
particularly, electrical activity.
Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that evolved around 600 million years 
ago. Early animals evolved different types of cells that are specialized to do things like 
secrete hormones or digestive enzymes and undergo contraction. As animals increased 
cells and got bigger, their sensor cells became separated from other cells and movement 
required coordination.
Neurons evolved between about 600 to 550 million years ago, most likely from epithelial 
cells. This probably occurred when animals needed to send sensory information over 
longer distances and control contraction of muscles for movement. Neurons developed 
as electrical signaling cells that formed nerve nets in cnidarian and/or ctenophore 
evolution.
Later, the evolution of special sense organs and nerve ganglia occurred several times in 
bilaterans (the clade that gave rise to crustaceans, insects, and vertebrates). There’s still 
much debate over the origin of neurons and nervous systems in the tree of life.CHAPTER 1 Welcome to the World of Neurobiology 9
Neurons evolved extensions called axons and dendrites that allow them to commu￾nicate rapidly, specifically, and over long distances. Action potentials are electrical 
signals transmitted along the axon. The axon forms connections called synapses 
with its targets (the majority on dendrites) where chemical communication occurs 
and typically produces electrical responses. The following sections discuss when 
and how neurons most likely evolved during animal evolution.
Arriving at a nervous system
Electrical signaling in the form of action potentials and cell-to-cell communica￾tion evolved in single-celled organisms before multicellularity evolved. Some 
nonmetazoan single-celled organisms express genes for secreted molecules and 
synaptic-related proteins. Evolving neurons adapted functions that single cells 
use to interact with the environment and other cells.
The next step was the extension of an axon, from one cell to distant cells where a 
specific signaling substance, called a neurotransmitter, is released. Now, instead of 
a multicellular signaling soup, there are circuits. Electrical and chemical signaling 
allowed for rapid communication across the distances from one end of an animal 
to another for sensing the surrounding environment and performing coordinated 
movements.
Coordinating responses in simple circuits
Nervous systems are complex and hard to study. The human brain is estimated to 
contain about 86 billion neurons and about the same number of glial cells. An 
average neuron receives a thousand or more synapses, meaning there are more 
than a hundred trillion synapses in the human brain. Neurobiologists don’t really 
know yet how single neurons work and don’t know, and can’t count, all of the 
connections between neurons.
Studying invertebrates
People often wonder why scientists study the nervous systems of flies, worms, 
squids, and slugs. The reason is they have advantages in that the cells are fewer, 
bigger, and/or more amenable to genetic manipulation. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew 
Huxley won the Nobel Prize for deducing the ionic basis of the action potential in 
the squid giant axon. Eric Kandel won the Nobel Prize for identifying memory 
mechanisms in the sea slug Aplysia.
Many invertebrates such as worms and insects have several hundred to a few 
thousand neurons. This vastly simplifies the problem of working out a complete 10 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
neural circuit, including which neurotransmitters are used by which neurons, 
what responses are produced and how activity is integrated.
Recent progress has been made in making model systems from mammals, study￾ing intact brains and behavior, and using brain slices, neural tissue cultures, and 
brain organoids and that can be investigated using molecular biology, microscopy, 
and electrical techniques.
Introducing Neurons and Glia
When neurobiologists talk about the nervous system, we often use the term neu￾ral. Neural refers to any part of the nervous system that involves neurons or glia. 
Part 1 of this book gives you more detailed information about neurons and glia. 
Here we describe how neurons and glia are functionally organized in the nervous 
system.
Beginning with functional anatomy
The nervous system has two main components that are connected and communi￾cate with each other:
» Central nervous system (CNS): The CNS is composed of the brain and 
spinal cord.
» Peripheral nervous system (PNS): The PNS includes the spinal nerves, 
cranial nerves, ganglia, and the enteric nervous system.
Neurons in the PNS are responsible for detecting and relaying sensory signals in 
the external world (somatic sensory system) and in the internal body (visceral 
sensory system). The PNS then relays that information to the CNS.
The CNS receives sensory information and uses it for perception and homeostasis. 
These are crucial for the other main functions of the CNS: to control the body’s 
movements and produce survival responses and behaviors. To help control and 
regulate this output, the mammalian CNS also provides emotion and cognitive 
functions.
The CNS sends output signals from motor neurons that extend axons in the nerves 
(the PNS) to your muscles, organs, and glands that control their contraction, 
relaxation, or secretion. The output in the PNS has two main divisions:CHAPTER 1 Welcome to the World of Neurobiology 11
» The somatic system controls skeletal muscles to control our movements.
» The autonomic system controls organs and glands to regulate internal functions.
Establishing the cells
Both neurons and glial cells have a cell body where the nucleus and cellular 
organelles are located. Cellular organelles include mitochondria, the endoplasmic 
reticulum, Golgi complex, and lysosomes. The nucleus contains the chromosomes 
and is where RNA is produced. Organelles carry out biochemical activities includ￾ing energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Figure 1-1 gives you a snapshot of 
typical neurons and glial cells that we discuss in the following sections. We 
describe the biochemistry and cell biology of neurons and glia in Chapter 2.
Neurons and glia are derived from parts of ectoderm that form the neural tube and 
neural crest. Prenatal development involves hard-wired genetic programs. Post￾natal development involves the sculpting of synaptic connections and depends on 
experience and activity. Chapter  3 focuses on the development of the nervous 
system.
Specializing the functions
Neurons, also referred to as nerve cells or neuronal cells, are the main signaling cells 
of the nervous system. Functionally, neurons can be classified as the following:
» Sensory neurons: Sensory neurons detect external and internal stimuli. The 
majority are located in the PNS and they transmit information to the CNS.
» Motor neurons: Motor neurons send signals out to control muscle contraction. 
They’re found in both the CNS and PNS.
» Interneurons: Interneurons include projection (or principal neurons) and local 
circuit neurons. They’re located in the CNS where they integrate information 
for perception, cognition, and/or the control of movement and behaviors for 
survival and homeostasis.
Neurons can also be classified based on the neurotransmitter they make and 
release, the effect they produce, and their morphology.
Glial cells are also referred to as neuroglia or glia. Microglia are the resident immune 
cells in the CNS. Astrocytes are located in the CNS where they provide metabolic 
support for neurons and other glia. Some astrocytes surround synapses where they 
regulate ion and neurotransmitter levels. Other astrocytes extend processes called 
end feet to surround brain capillaries where they transport nutrients into the CNS.12 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology

Forming the barriers
Brain capillaries are formed by vascular endothelial cells that make tight junc￾tions. These junctions prevent the direct diffusion of water soluble nutrients from 
the blood into the CNS and forms the blood-brain barrier. It’s the reason the CNS 
requires astrocytes to transport nutrients between capillaries and neurons. 
Another type of glial cell called pericytes surround the capillaries and help regulate 
the capillary diameter or vasodilation. Microglia are the resident immune cells in 
the CNS that help with the detection and removal of pathogens and damaged cells.
In the CNS, about half of the axons are myelinated by oligodendrocytes. Myelina￾tion involves the wrapping of an axon by many layers of the oligodendrocyte cell 
membrane. In the PNS, the majority of axons are myelinated within the nerve 
where the Schwann cells provide the myelin membrane. Myelination of axons 
increases the speed and efficiency of action potentials traveling along the axon.
The brain contains fluid-filled tubes inside called the ventricles, which are con￾tinuous with the central canal in the spinal cord. The ventricles are lined by epen￾dymal cells and contain a region called the choroid plexus formed by specialized 
ependymal cells and capillaries. The ependymal cells synthesize and transport 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inside the ventricles.
Electrifying the membrane
All cells have a membrane potential, a difference in electrical charge across the 
membrane. Neurons use changes in the membrane potential for communication. 
The axon is where an action potential is produced and conducted to the presynaptic 
region. We describe the basis of electrical signaling and action potentials in 
Chapter 4.
Communicating with targets
The dendrites are typically branched and are the main receiving processes in neu￾rons. Many dendrites contain small bumps or protrusions called dendritic spines. 
Dendrites and dendritic spines receive incoming signals from other neurons at 
synapses. These electrical signals are also described in Chapter 4.
At the synapse, action potentials are converted into release of chemicals called 
neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters activate receptors on the target cell. We 
describe the mechanism of synaptic transmission in Chapter 5 and neurotrans￾mitter systems in Chapter 6.14 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Protecting and Nourishing the Parts
Here we explain how the nervous system is protected by non-neural structures, 
how it receives its blood supply, and what nerves contain.
Safeguarding the CNS
The brain is encased in the skull bone and the spinal cord is surrounded by the 
bones of the vertebral column. Underneath the bones are the meninges, three lay￾ers of membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. We describe the meninges 
in Chapter 3.
Providing the supplies
The brain and spinal cord are highly vascularized, containing many arteries, veins, 
arterioles, venules, and capillaries. The main blood supply to the front and middle 
regions of the brain is from the internal carotid arteries. The blood supply to the 
posterior brain and spinal cord is from the vertebral arteries.
The CNS capillaries are different from the rest of the body’s general capillaries in 
that they, together with astrocytes and pericytes, form a blood-brain barrier. The 
brain contains many venous plexuses that receive the blood and drain it into the 
jugular veins. A lymphatic system in the meninges mediates the movement of 
waste and immune cells.
The ventricles inside the brain synthesize and circulate CSF. Some CSF is diverted 
around the brain where the meninges transfers the CSF to the blood. The rest of 
the CSF flows in the central canal inside the spinal cord.
Supporting the PNS
In the PNS, the nerves are bundles of axons that are covered with layers of con￾nective tissue. Nerves also contain the myelinating Schwann cells and blood ves￾sels. The axons in nerves originate or terminate in the spinal cord or brainstem.
In the PNS, ganglia are groups neuron cell bodies clustered in regions outside the 
spinal cord or brainstem (refer to Chapter 7). The PNS is divided into the somatic, 
autonomic (visceral), and enteric nervous systems. The two types of ganglia are 
sensory ganglia and autonomic ganglia. The enteric nervous system contains both 
sensory and motor neurons in the gastrointestinal tracts.CHAPTER 1 Welcome to the World of Neurobiology 15
Navigating Around the Nervous System
The brain and spinal cord are formed by groups of neurons that work together to 
connect to other neurons through tracts. Examining the CNS in fixed sections, you 
see regions the following regions: 
» Gray matter contains neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, synapses, and astrocytes.
» White matter contains myelinated axons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes.
These sections explain the gray and white matter regions in the CNS.
Organizing gray matter
Gray matter in the CNS is organized in several ways:
» In the brain the cortical gray matter is layered and found in the cerebral cortex 
and cerebellar cortex.
» The other groups of neurons in the brain are called nuclei (a single nucleus). 
Subcortical brain structures, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothala￾mus, amygdala, and brainstem, are formed by many separate nuclei.
» In the spinal cord, the gray matter is located in the horns. The ventral horns 
contain motor neurons while the dorsal horn contains sensory relay neurons. 
Both regions contain spinal interneurons.
Tracking along white matter
Within the CNS, axon tracts form the white matter. There are different types of 
tracts in the brain that connect neurons in one cortical region to another cortical 
region or to subcortical areas. In the spinal cord, the white matter is located in the 
regions around the white matter and contains the axons of all the ascending sen￾sory and descending motor tracts.
Dissecting functions of the CNS
Looking at the mammalian brain from the outside, shown in Figure 1-2, you can 
see three major parts: 
» Forebrain: The largest part of the brain, it contains the cerebrum and 
subcortical nuclei. The cerebrum is composed of the cerebral cortices and 16 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
cerebral white matter. Subcortical structures including the basal ganglia, 
amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland.
» Brain stem: The midbrain is located underneath the thalamus. Below that is 
the pons, and below that the medulla that ends at the top of the spinal cord. 
The brain stem is the oldest part of the brain that’s essential for survival 
responses and homeostasis.
» Cerebellum: It sticks out from the back of the pons in the brainstem. 
It contains as many neurons as the rest of the brain combined. Though 
it evolved first in vertebrates, the cerebellum continued to evolve as 
mammals added the larger neocortex. It functions in motor control.
FIGURE 1-2:
Views of the 
human brain.

Looking at the cerebrum
The cerebrum contains the cerebral cortex and the underlying cerebral white mat￾ter. Figure 1-2 shows that from the outside you see many gyri (singular: gyrus), 
which are ridges, and many sulci (singular: sulcus), which are grooves that give 
the human and some mammalian brains their folded appearance. Folding allowed 
more cortical areas to fit inside the skull during evolution.
The longitudinal fissure separates the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Deep 
sulci separate the cerebrum into four lobes on each side, called the frontal, pari￾etal, temporal, and occipital lobe, named for the cranial bones that overlies each 
(see the next section for more about these lobes). The central sulcus separates the 
frontal and parietal lobes while the lateral sulcus separates the temporal lobe from 
the other three lobes.
Figuring out the lobes’ functions
Figure  1-2 also illustrates the lobes of the cerebrum. Here is a brief overview 
(Chapter 11 examines the functional anatomy of the lobes in greater detail):
» Frontal lobe: It contains the motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, frontal eye fields, 
and Broca’s area. The frontal lobe operates primarily to program and organize 
goal-directed movements, speech, and executive functions.
» Parietal lobe: It contains the somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal 
cortex, a sensory association area that integrates somatosensory, visual, and 
auditory inputs.
» Temporal lobe: It contains the auditory cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. 
The temporal lobe functions in processing emotion, deciphering auditory 
information, understanding language, and encoding memory.
» Occipital lobe: It contains the visual cortex composed of multiple visual 
processing areas.
Situating underneath the cortex
Underneath and within the cerebral white matter are the subcortical areas. They 
include the thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem. 
We introduce the functions of these areas in the next section and in Part  2 of 
this book.18 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Moving the Correct Way
An important function of the brain is the control of motor systems. Motor systems 
involve somatic control of skeletal muscles. They also control contraction of the 
heart and smooth muscles in organs and tissues by the autonomic motor system. 
Part 2 of this book focuses on mechanisms and control of movements and behav￾iors. Here we introduce the basics.
Making the movements
Upper motor neurons from the motor cortex send axons to the lower motor neu￾rons and nearby interneurons. The lower motor neurons provide the output to 
skeletal muscles to control their contraction (see Chapter 7).
Controlling the output
The motor cortex contains areas involved in control of motor output. The primary 
motor cortex provides direct motor commands to produce movements. The sup￾plementary motor area and premotor cortex receive inputs from cortical and sub￾cortical areas and control the output from the primary motor cortex.
The basal ganglia provide action selection and inhibit unwanted movements. The 
cerebellum is necessary for learning movement sequences and detecting and cor￾recting errors to coordinate movements. Chapter 8 discusses these brain regions 
in motor control.
Focusing on older parts
Both the spinal cord and brainstem function like subcontractors of the brain to 
execute the brain’s instructions and report on their progress. They contain lower 
motor neurons whose axons control muscle cell contraction. They receive sensory 
inputs for both local circuit reflexes and for relaying sensory information to the 
thalamus, which then transmits to the sensory cortices.
The brainstem and spinal cord are also essential in survival and homeostasis. Both 
control the autonomic nervous system involved in regulation of heartrate, blood 
pressure, and respiration. The sympathetic system prepares us for action in the 
fight-or-flight mode, while the parasympathetic system organizes resources for 
digestion and the conservation of energy. Chapter 9 describes the basic organiza￾tion and functions of these regions.CHAPTER 1 Welcome to the World of Neurobiology 19
Ensuring homeostasis
The hypothalamus receives input from many brain areas and controls homeo￾static processes including regulation of temperature and feeding. It provides con￾trol of the autonomic nervous system and circadian rhythms, the body’s internal 
clock. It also links the brain with the endocrine system by controlling the secre￾tion of hormones from the pituitary gland.
The cingulate cortex is involved in processing pain, error, and conflict detection, 
processing and regulating emotions, regulating autonomic functions, social 
behavior, and empathy. Regions involved in memory provide key inputs for our 
survival responses and cognition (see Chapter 15).
The amygdala is an emotion processing center for emotions like fear and motiva￾tion. It’s where fear memories are encoded. Its outputs contribute to regulation of 
autonomic and endocrine functions, as well as executive functions such as 
decision making and emotional control.
The reticular formation is a diffuse network of neurons and axon tracts that runs 
through the brainstem up into portions of the thalamus. It controls body state 
through processes such as controlling wakefulness versus sleep, alertness, and 
homeostatic mechanisms such as heart rate.
Chapter 10 describes survival and homeostatic functions of the brainstem and lim￾bic system. We discuss the specific functions of these brain areas and how they 
interact with other parts of the brain.
Completing the circuit
The neocortex dominates the mammalian brain in volume, particularly in pri￾mates. It has the same six-layered structure virtually everywhere, with the simi￾lar cell types and cortical minicolumn circuits. It’s responsible for producing 
sensory perception and controlling voluntary movement and cognitive functions. 
Chapter 11 describes the neocortex and its functions.
Chapter 12 focuses on the types of injury, degeneration, and dysfunction that can 
compromise the control or production of movement. We describe the most 
common developmental disorders and movement disorders that involve motor 
systems.20 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Perceiving the World, Thinking, 
and Remembering
Part 3 describes how sensory systems generate perception and how brain areas 
cooperate to provide cognitive functions, including executive functions, language, 
and memory. Chapter 18 discusses neurodevelopmental and mental disorders that 
impact cognitive functions. Here we give a brief overview.
Seeing and hearing is believing
In many mammals, visual processing dominates the brain. In both vision and 
audition, high-order brain areas process complex inputs, such as face-specific 
neurons in inferotemporal cortex in vision, and language specific areas in audition 
such as Wernicke’s area. Chapter 13 focuses on the visual and auditory sensory 
systems.
Sensing touch, smell, and taste
In the somatosensory system, sensation is composed of sensory receptors includ￾ing mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors in the skin, muscles, 
and joints. These allow you to perceive touch, temperature, and painful stimuli.
The sense of smell is mediated by olfactory receptor cells in the nose while the 
sense of taste is mediated by receptors mostly in taste buds on the tongue. Your 
perception of flavor is formed by a combination of taste and smell. Chapter 14 
examines somatosensory, smell, and taste systems in more detail.
Focusing on learning, memory, 
and plasticity
A hallmark of mammals is they can change their behavior through learning and 
memory (see Chapter 15). The short-term representation of an event and its con￾text occurs in the prefrontal cortex as working memory. The hippocampus encodes 
long-term declarative memory for facts and events and spatial memory. The 
amygdala encodes fear memory. The basal ganglia and cerebellum encode proce￾dural memory for habits and motor skills.CHAPTER 1 Welcome to the World of Neurobiology 21
The encoding of memory involves synaptic plasticity in each of the brain areas 
identified. Research suggests that long-term memory is stored in cortical circuits 
in the cerebral cortex. This means that the neocortex is involved in not only 
the integration and processing of sensory, motor, and cognitive information, but 
also in its storage as well.
Controlling with the executive brain
The frontal lobes are responsible for planning and executing behavior (refer to 
Chapter 16). During evolution there was a relative expansion of the frontal lobe 
compared to the rest of the brain in humans compared to other primates, and 
primates compared to other mammals.
The motor cortex controls motor neurons for regulation of contraction of skeletal 
muscles. The frontal eye fields control eye movements, and Broca’s area mediates 
language production. The prefrontal cortex produces executive functions for per￾forming goal-directed movements and controlling behavior.
Thinking about cognition
Several cognitive functions, including language, are lateralized in humans. The 
capacity for learning language is innate in humans and involves Wernicke’s and 
Broca’s areas. Neurobiology research is working to understand how human 
language systems operate. Chapter  17 examines the components of the human 
brain areas most important for cognitive functions.
Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. The prefrontal 
cortex is involved in higher-order cognitive processes such as working memory, 
planning, decision-making, reasoning, problem-solving, and goal setting. The 
prefrontal cortex also acts in behavioral self-control and emotional control. These 
cognitive functions, together with your long-term declarative memory, form the 
components of intelligence.
Consciousness is subjective and includes being aware of your sensations, thoughts, 
experiences, and emotions. Researchers have studied brain mechanisms that may 
underlie consciousness and have proposed many hypotheses about the basis of 
consciousness.CHAPTER 2 Meeting the Building Blocks 23
Chapter 2
Meeting the Building 
Blocks
Neurons and glia are cells, and like all cells in the body, they’re composed 
of water, ions, and organic molecules including carbohydrates, proteins, 
nucleic acids, and lipids. Surrounding the cell is the plasma membrane. 
The cytoplasm contains cellular organelles where proteins are synthesized and 
metabolism takes place, and the cytoskeleton keeps everything in shape and 
moves things around.
The DNA is contained in the nucleus and in mitochondria outside the nucleus. 
Genes are sequences of DNA. Which genes are expressed is what makes the body’s 
cell types different from each other and distinguishes different types of neurons 
and glia. This chapter covers the basic biochemistry and genetics relevant to neu￾rons and glia and describes what makes neurons and glial so specialized.
Introducing Molecular Building Blocks
Neurons and glia are similar to other cells because they contain water, ions, and 
organic molecules (monomers and polymers) that contain carbon, hydrogen, 
nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus. Monomers are single molecule building blocks 
IN THIS CHAPTER

proteins

lipids and proteins

that can be combined to form polymers. Sugars form polysaccharides, amino acids 
form proteins, nucleotides and deoxynucleotides form the nucleic acids (RNA and 
DNA), and lipids form fats and bilayers.
The following sections describe the characteristics of ions, bonds, and molecules, 
and the features of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA.
Hydrating with water and electrolytes
Like other cells in the body, neurons and glia contain about 70 percent water and 
many types of ions. Ions are charged atoms and molecules. They can have a posi￾tive charge (cation) or a negative charge (anion). Ions can contain one charge 
(monovalent) or have more than one charge (divalent and so forth).
The most important intracellular atomic ions for signaling are sodium, potassium, 
chloride, and calcium. Magnesium and iron ions are cofactors for many proteins. 
Some important molecular ions are acetate, ammonia, and bicarbonate ions.
Identifying the two types of bonds
A chemical bond is formed when two or more atoms have an attraction to one 
another. Two main types of bonds between atoms are as follows:
» Covalent bonds: They’re strong bonds that involve the sharing of electrons. 
They can be either polar or nonpolar. Molecules are formed by covalent 
bonding between atoms. Molecules are generally stable in cells and don’t 
break apart on their own.
» Noncovalent bonds: They’re weaker bonds that involve electrostatic interac￾tions, like ionic and hydrogen bonds, or other interactions like hydrophobic 
bonds between lipids.
Dissolving in water or lipids
Polar covalent bonds involve unequal sharing of the electrons, leading to a sepa￾ration of charge, called a dipole. The resulting molecule has a concentration of 
positive charge in one region and negative charge in another region. Water is a 
polar molecule because the two hydrogens are slightly positive, with a slightly 
negative charge around the oxygen in the middle. Polar molecules are soluble in 
water and are called hydrophilic. Polar molecules are found in the extracellular 
fluid, cytoplasm, and inside organelles.CHAPTER 2 Meeting the Building Blocks 25
In nonpolar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared equally between or among 
the atoms. A nonpolar molecule doesn’t have a permanent dipole. Most nonpolar 
molecules aren’t soluble in water and are called hydrophobic. Fatty acids like cook￾ing oils are an example. Some molecules have a region with polar bonds and a 
region with nonpolar bonds. An example is a phospholipid, which forms lipid 
bilayers in cellular membranes.
Covalent bonds are strong bonds that produce the stable primary sequence of 
polymers such as proteins, DNA, and polysaccharides, and keep them intact in 
cells. Noncovalent bonds are much weaker, but they’re important because they 
give water its characteristics, produce the three-dimensional structures of pro￾teins and DNA, and underlie the formation of biological membranes.
Creating cellular subunits and polymers
The two types of metabolic pathways are as follows:
» Catabolic pathways: They break down polymers into individual monomers 
(building blocks). Most catabolic reactions are exergonic (energy releasing), and 
the energy released can be used to produce ATP.
» Anabolic pathways: They create polymers from individual monomers. Most 
anabolic reactions are endergonic and require an energy input (usually from 
ATP hydrolysis).
Both types of reactions require enzymes for the formation or breaking of covalent 
bonds. Enzymes lower the activation energy for reactions to speed up their rate.
Replicating DNA
DNA is a nucleic acid composed of long sequences of nucleotides covalently bonded 
to each other. Nucleotides contain a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a 
phosphate. The bases in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and 
thymine (T). DNA forms a double helix that binds and wraps around histone 
proteins to form the chromosomes. The nucleus contains the cell’s chromosomes 
and is where DNA replication and RNA transcription occur. Mitochondria contain 
a small mitochondrial genome separate from the nucleus.
Replication is the synthesis of a new DNA molecule (chromosome) from a DNA 
template. It occurs during mitosis for all somatic cells in the body. After the DNA 
is replicated, the copies (chromosomes) are segregated, and the cellular compo￾nents undergo cell division by cytokinesis. In mitosis, each daughter cell inherits 
the full genome of its parent cell as well as cytoplasm and organelles.26 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Reproductive organs produce gametes by meiosis. Each gamete receives only one 
copy of each chromosome. During meiosis, a new chromosome can be created 
from a combination of both parent chromosomes in a process of breaking and 
joining, which is called crossover. When gametes combine during fertilization, the 
zygote begins with a pair of chromosomes, one from each parent that it replicates 
during mitosis.
Getting Into Genes
The genotype is the genetic makeup of a cell, determined by the cell’s DNA. The 
sequence of the DNA contains specific units or segments called genes that are the 
basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes have the instructions for 
producing RNA and proteins. An estimated 20,000 protein-coding genes are pres￾ent in the human genome. Only about 1.5 percent of the entire human genome is 
used to code for proteins. Gene expression is the process by which information 
encoded in the DNA is used to direct the synthesis of proteins.
Gene expression determines the types and levels of proteins synthesized in the 
cell. The majority of functions and activities of the cell are dependent on and car￾ried out by proteins. Not all of the protein-encoding genes are expressed equally 
in all cells. Different cells express different sets of genes. This is called differential 
gene expression. The types and levels of proteins a cell produces determines its 
phenotype, including its morphology, physiology, and function.
Gene expression can be controlled by several mechanisms, including transcrip￾tion, the processing, export, and degradation of RNA, and the synthesis, activa￾tion, and degradation of proteins. Of these, the most widespread control of gene 
expression is through transcription. The following sections address some of these 
processes in greater detail.
The DNA molecule is a double-stranded helix. It’s well suited for storing and rep￾licating biological information because the two strands are complementary. This 
complementary structure enables replication by splitting the two DNA strands, so 
each can form a new complementary strand. The double helix is stable and resist￾ant to cleavage, allowing the body’s trillions of cells to safely store the genome.
Creating RNA in transcription
Transcription is the process of synthesis of an RNA molecule based on a DNA tem￾plate. The RNA is then used to direct the synthesis of proteins. Transcription is 
regulated by transcription factors and epigenetics. Transcription factors are DNA￾binding proteins. Binding of transcription factors to a region in the gene called the CHAPTER 2 Meeting the Building Blocks 27
promotor can activate or inhibit transcription. About 1,500 different transcription 
factors are encoded in the human genome.
Examining epigenetics
In the DNA within the chromosome, the base sequences of A, T, G, and C are iden￾tical in the majority of cells of the body. However, some of those bases and the 
histone proteins that bind to the DNA become modified during development.
Epigenetics (meaning “above the genome”) is the covalent modification of DNA 
and histones. These modifications can enhance or inhibit the access of the DNA to 
transcription factors and the transcription machinery. Two of the best character￾ized mechanisms that provide epigenetic control over gene expression are DNA 
methylation and acetylation of the histone proteins.
During development, changes in epigenetic modifications are critical for cellular 
differentiation. In development, totipotent stem cells, which are cells that can 
develop into any cell type, differentiate into hundreds of different cell types in the 
body, such as neurons, astrocytes, muscle cells, or liver cells. Many epigenetic 
modifications are preserved and persist in subsequent cell divisions of that 
cell line.
Even though many epigenetic modifications in neurons are stable and ensure the 
neuronal phenotype, others are reversible and dynamic. Dynamic epigenetic mod￾ifications have been measured in the adult brain and proposed to underlie aspects 
of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is a feature of neurons that allows them to rewire 
their connections in response to external and internal stimuli (refer to Chapter 15 
for more about neuroplasticity).
Focusing on transcription mechanisms
Transcription occurs in the cell nucleus. The transcription machinery reads the 
sequences of bases in the DNA template to produce a matching RNA product. The 
RNA strand is complementary to the DNA strand except that in RNA the nucleotide 
uracil takes the place that thymine occupies in DNA.
Three types of RNA are produced in the nucleus:
» Ribosomal RNA: It binds to proteins to form the ribosomes, the machinery 
involved in protein synthesis.
» Transfer RNA: It’s used to bind to amino acids and transfer them to a protein 
as its being synthesized.28 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
» Messenger RNA (mRNA): It’s used to instruct protein synthesis during 
translation. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and inserts the specific 
amino acid based on the mRNA sequence (see the next section for more 
information).
The initial product of transcription is a primary mRNA transcript that’s processed 
before being transported out of the nucleus. It’s modified to yield heterophilic 
nuclear RNA (hnRNA). The hnRNA contains noncoding regions called introns and 
coding regions called exons. The hnRNA is spliced to remove the introns. Later, 
some exons may be spliced out to produce the final mRNA. This splicing can pro￾duce different mRNAs called splice variants from the same gene.
Synthesizing Proteins in Translation
Twenty different amino acids become incorporated into proteins. Amino acids 
contain a free amino group, a free carboxylic acid group, and another group called 
a residue or side chain. The amino acid residues are either polar uncharged, polar 
charged, or nonpolar. Polar/uncharged and polar/charged amino acids are hydro￾philic while nonpolar amino acids are hydrophobic.
Several amino acids have another important activity. They can also function as 
neurotransmitters or as substrates in neurotransmitter synthesis. In addition, 
neuropeptides can serve as neurotransmitters. Chapters 5 and 6 discuss the roles 
of amino acids and neuropeptides as neurotransmitters.
Coding for proteins
A gene is a region of DNA that codes for an individual protein. A codon is a three￾nucleotide series in the DNA (and RNA) that codes for a specific amino acid. Within 
each gene are many codons. The genetic code provides the information about 
which amino acid will be inserted into the primary amino acid sequence of a 
protein.
The primary amino acid sequence forms the backbone of the protein as the amino 
acids are covalently bonded to each other during translation. Ribosomes are large 
protein-RNA complexes that mediate translation. Translation of cytoplasmic pro￾teins occurs on free polyribosomes. For proteins embedded in the membrane and 
secreted proteins, translation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), called the 
rough ER. We describe this more in the section “Trafficking Membrane Proteins 
and Signals” later in this chapter.CHAPTER 2 Meeting the Building Blocks 29
Folding in three dimensions
As the protein primary backbone sequence is synthesized, amino acid residues 
interact with each other to form noncovalent bonds that fold the protein into the 
following:
» Secondary structures: They’re formed by hydrogen bonds between atoms in 
the protein backbone. The two most common types are the alpha-helix and 
beta-sheet.
» Tertiary structures: They occur by the noncovalent bonding between the 
residues on the amino acids. They ensure the three-dimensional structure of 
a protein that’s essential for it to perform its function correctly.
Functioning in different ways
Functional categories of proteins include enzymes, transcription factors, transla￾tion factors, cytoskeletal proteins, motor proteins, ion channels, ion transporters, 
receptors, cell adhesion proteins, and signaling proteins and neuropeptides.
The ribosome binds to the end of an mRNA molecule and then moves along it. The 
ribosome reads the mRNA, and for each codon it reads, it inserts a specific amino 
acid into the growing protein chain that was instructed by the codon.
After translation occurs, other chemical groups may be covalently attached to the 
amino acid sequence of the protein, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and phosphates. 
Adding phosphate groups is called phosphorylation, which is a common mecha￾nism for activating or inactivating an enzyme.
Organizing the Organelles
The plasma membrane maintains the contents of the cell, preventing necessary 
molecules from exiting and unwanted toxic molecules from entering. The cytoplasm
is the aqueous part of the cell, filled with soluble and cytoskeletal proteins. It con￾tains cellular organelles, some of which are surrounded by membranes to provide 
compartmentalization. The following organelles reside in neurons and glia:
» Mitochondria: They’re self-replicating organelles that generate adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy source. In oxidative phosphorylation,
energy from electron transfer involving oxygen adds a phosphate to adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP) to make ATP. Mitochondria have their own DNA and 
multiply by cell division on their own.30 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
» Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): The ER is an organelle composed of flattened 
membrane tubes. The ER has two forms:
• Smooth ER synthesizes lipids.
• Rough ER contains ribosomes involved in translation of membrane and 
secreted proteins.
The ER also sequesters and releases calcium ions.
» Golgi apparatus: It modifies lipids and transmembrane proteins after 
translation. This is also where membrane and secreted proteins are sorted for 
trafficking to the plasma membrane and some organelles. It’s also where 
neuropeptides are packaged into vesicles.
» Lysosomes: They contain enzymes that degrade damaged proteins, lipids 
nucleic acids, and carbohydrates. Proteosomes also contain enzymes that 
degrade proteins.
» Centrosome: It’s an organizing center for microtubules important in separat￾ing chromosomes during mitosis. It also controls transport of proteins 
through the RER and Golgi apparatus.
All of the activities in the organelles and cytoplasm require a constant supply of 
energy, usually in the form of ATP. In the next sections we describe how neurons 
and glia produce their energy.
Finding the energy
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and involves the conversion of one glucose 
molecule into two pyruvates, with the net production of two molecules of ATP and 
two molecules of NADH. Glycolysis doesn’t require oxygen.
Mitochondria encompass three metabolic processes: 
» Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle
» Electron transport chain
» Oxidative phosphorylation
Combined, they produce ATP from pyruvates and NADH.  This is called cellular 
respiration or aerobic respiration, and it depends on oxygen.CHAPTER 2 Meeting the Building Blocks 31
Depending on astrocytes
Astrocytes transport and take up glucose and other nutrients from the brain capil￾laries. Astrocytes also release glucose and other nutrients, such as lactate, into the 
extracellular fluid.
Neurons have low levels of glycolytic enzymes so they can’t make ATP using glu￾cose in glycolysis. Instead, they depend on the glucose-lactate shuttle provided by 
astrocytes. Astrocytes convert glucose to lactate and transport the lactate out. 
Neurons take up the lactate and convert it to pyruvate. The pyruvate is transported 
in mitochondria for the Krebs cycle, electron transport, and oxidative phosphory￾lation. Neurons depend almost entirely on mitochondria and aerobic respiration 
for ATP production. In neurons, mitochondria are located in the presynaptic axon, 
cell soma, and dendrites.
Ordering with the Cytoskeleton
The cytoskeleton is a network of protein filaments located throughout the cyto￾plasm that functions to maintain cell shape and work as transport pathways 
through the cell. The cytoskeleton can be dynamic because each cytoskeletal fila￾ment is composed of many monomer protein subunits, which polymerize to form 
the polymers. They can depolymerize as well.
The neuronal intermediate filaments are called neurofilaments and are located 
mainly in the axon. They’re stable filaments, and their main function is to provide 
strength and stability for the axon and to ensure the axon maintains a constant 
diameter along its length.
The other cytoskeletal filaments are involved in dynamic functions in neurons, 
and we discuss these in the next sections.
Mobilizing with microtubules
Microtubules are the largest filaments and are found in the axon, cell body, and 
dendrites. In the axon, microtubules form the tracks for fast axonal transport (FAT).
FAT also involves microtubule-based motors called kinesins and dyneins that move 
cargoes to and from the cell body and axon terminus. The cargoes include secre￾tory vesicles, cytoskeletal and scaffolding complexes, and mitochondria.
Microtubules and its motors are also used in dendrites to transport cargoes along 
the dendrites. There are microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that bind the 
microtubule and regulate its stability, polymerization, and depolymerization. An 32 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
important MAP is tau, a protein that has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). Chapter 15 discusses AD in more detail.
Getting around with actin
The smallest filaments are actin microfilaments that are found in the axon, cell 
body, dendrites, and dendritic spines. Many proteins can bind actin and regulate 
actin polymerization, depolymerization, bundling, and localization. Myosin is an 
actin-based motor, which in neurons moves vesicle and organelle cargoes along 
the actin cytoskeleton.
Actin microfilaments are important during neuronal migration and axonal out￾growth. Dendritic spines are where the majority of excitatory synaptic transmis￾sion occurs in the CNS. Research shows that reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton 
in dendritic spines is important in the development of synapses and in synaptic 
plasticity underlying learning and memory (see Chapter 15).
Astrocytes synthesize an intermediate filament called glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP). GFAP is present throughout the astrocytes and into the astrocytes pro￾cesses. GFAP is a marker for brain injury because levels increase when astrocytes 
become reactive following injury.
Setting Boundaries: Cellular Membranes
The cell’s plasma membrane and that of organelles is formed by a lipid bilayer 
into which transmembrane proteins are inserted. Several types of lipids form the 
bilayer. Transmembrane proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer have at least one 
region that spans the entire membrane from one side to the other side. The fol￾lowing sections delve deeper into the bilayer.
Locating lipids in the bilayer
Lipid bilayers contain phospholipids, cholesterol, and sphingolipids. Phospholip￾ids comprise about 50 to 60 percent of the bilayer. A phospholipid molecule con￾tains a glycerol backbone, two long chain fatty acids, and a phosphate head group 
that can also have another molecule covalently attached to it (see Figure 2-1).
Each phospholipid contains two fatty acids attached to the glycerol. Fatty acids are 
carboxylic acids with long aliphatic (hydrocarbon) chains between about 12 and 24 
carbons in length. Fatty acids differ in their carbon chain length and presence of 
double bonds. They can be saturated (no double bonds) or unsaturated (one of 
more double bonds).CHAPTER 2 Meeting the Building Blocks 33
Phospholipids are called amphipathic (or amphiphilic) molecules. Amphipathic 
describes a molecule possessing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. 
Phospholipids possess a hydrophilic head group and two hydrophobic hydrocar￾bon tails attached to the glycerol backbone. Figure 2-2 shows a schematic struc￾ture of a phospholipid.
Phosphatidic acid (PA) is the simplest phospholipid. It has a phosphate head 
group. Other phospholipids attach another molecule to the phosphate and contain 
either choline, ethanolamine, serine, or inositol covalently attached to the phos￾phate head group.
Forming the bilayers
Phospholipids spontaneously form lipid bilayers in aqueous solution. For the 
middle, internal part of the bilayer, hydrocarbon tails bind to each other through 
hydrophobic bonds. Because the phosphate and additional molecule head groups 
are polar, charged, and hydrophilic, they stick out into the aqueous solutions. 
Because of the hydrophobic interior, the lipid bilayer forms a barrier that’s imper￾meable to the movement of hydrophilic molecules across it.
FIGURE 2-1:

structure.

Cholesterol is a sterol (a type of steroid) obtained from the diet and also synthe￾sized by the liver. The plasma membrane is composed of about 30 to 40 percent 
cholesterol. At physiological temperatures, cholesterol decreases the membrane 
fluidity and decreases the membrane permeability. Together these effects stabi￾lize the plasma membrane and make it a better barrier. Figure 2-3 shows a bilayer 
model (molecular layer two molecules thick).
Adding transmembrane proteins
Transmembrane proteins are proteins that are embedded in the lipid bilayer. Parts 
of a transmembrane protein stick out into the intracellular cytoplasm, while other 
parts stick out into the extracellular fluid. The region that’s embedded in the 
bilayer is called the transmembrane spanning domain (TSD). Many transmembrane 
proteins, like channels, transporters, and receptors, fold and cross back and forth 
across the membrane and so have multiple TSDs.
One important distinction among the amino acids that make up proteins is 
whether the residues are hydrophilic or hydrophobic. The regions of transmem￾brane proteins that extend into the cytoplasm or extracellular fluid contain pri￾marily hydrophilic residues. The TSDs contain a majority of hydrophobic residues 
that interact with the lipid interior of the bilayer.

model of a single

Trafficking Membrane Proteins 
and Signals
Transmembrane proteins are synthesized by ribosomes associated with the rough 
endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Insertion of transmembrane proteins into the mem￾brane occurs during translation. This ensures that the transmembrane protein is 
incorporated with the correct orientation into the membrane, which is especially 
important if there are multiple TSDs.
Two other types of proteins that are synthesized in the RER are the proteins and 
peptides that are secreted from the cell. These include extracellular matrix pro￾teins, growth and trophic factors, and neuropeptides.
Transmembrane proteins become embedded in the RER membrane; secreted pro￾teins and peptides become incorporated inside the RER.  This means that they 
require a specific process to move them from their site of synthesis in the RER to 
their final destination, such as the plasma membrane. This process is called 
membrane trafficking, which we explain in these sections.

Moving cargoes around
Membrane trafficking involves the movement of transmembrane proteins, 
secreted proteins and peptides, and lipids. Together they’re referred to as cargoes.
The cargoes are moved from the RER to the Golgi and then to the plasma mem￾brane in a process called the secretory or biosynthetic pathway.
The movement of the cargoes involves transport vesicles that move them first 
from the RER to the Golgi where they can be modified. As cargoes move through 
the Golgi and reach the trans Golgi network (TGN), they are sorted into vesicles 
called secretory vesicles. Secretory vesicles then traffic to the plasma membrane or 
other organelles.
When secretory vesicles reach the plasma membrane, a process called exocytosis
induces the secretory vesicle to fuse with the plasma membrane. Both the trans￾membrane proteins and lipids become incorporated into the plasma membrane.
For secreted proteins and peptides, the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma 
membrane by exocytosis induces the contents inside the vesicle to be released 
outside the cell. This exocytosis process can be regulated; in some situations, it 
depends on an increase in calcium ions from a signal, in a process referred to as 
regulated secretion.
Bringing cargoes in
Another membrane trafficking pathway, called the endosomal pathway, involves 
the trafficking of cargoes from the plasma membrane back inside the cell. The 
endosomal pathway is important for maintaining the area of the plasma mem￾brane because it 
» Balances the outflow process of the secretory/biosynthetic pathway
» Is used for the delivery of some nutrients like cholesterol and iron into the cell
» Is involved in the removal of damaged transmembrane proteins by delivering 
them for degradation to the lysosome
» Is used to control the number of transmembrane proteins on the plasma 
membrane, an important mechanism in synaptic plasticity
Sorting the cargoes
The endosomal pathway involves endocytosis from the plasma membrane, which 
is the infolding of plasma membrane to form an endocytic vesicle. Endocytic CHAPTER 2 Meeting the Building Blocks 37
vesicles traffic to the early endosome. There the transmembrane proteins and 
lipids are sorted into vesicles to be recycled back to the plasma membrane or 
transported to the lysosome for degradation.
In neurons in the presynaptic region, synaptic vesicles bud off the early endosome 
(sometimes called the synaptic endosome) and are then filled with neurotrans￾mitters. Following exocytosis and neurotransmitter release, the membrane is 
retrieved by endocytosis. The endocytic vesicles fuse with the early endosome and 
new synaptic vesicles are generated.
Releasing signals from neurons
Neurotransmission is different from hormone signaling because neurons contact 
their targets, neurons, muscles, or gland cells, directly at synapses. The neuro￾transmitter released usually activates receptors directly across the synaptic cleft 
in postsynaptic cell, which allows for more direct and complex communication 
with neurons than is possible with hormones.
Neurosecretory cells are located in glands that release hormones or neurohor￾mones into the bloodstream. Receptors in target cells bind the hormone, activat￾ing intracellular cascades that produce responses. The pituitary gland is stimulated 
by hypothalamic neurons to release hormones like growth hormones. The adrenal 
gland releases epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to stimulation from 
the sympathetic nervous system.
Keeping the pressure
The plasma membranes of neurons, as well as other cells in the body, are stable, 
but not rigid like the cell walls of plants. This means that neurons are flexible and 
can be deformed by mechanical pressure. Neurons exist within a matrix of glial 
cells and an extracellular matrix that holds the brain tissue together.
Although the extracellular matrix around cells is effective in maintaining a sup￾porting environment that prevents neurons from being damaged by mechanical 
forces, neurons must actively resist another type of force — osmotic pressure. The 
plasma membranes have water-permeable channels called aquaporins.
Aquaporin channels in the membrane equilibrate water between the cytoplasm 
and extracellular fluid. Neurons, like other cells, have a variety of mechanisms for 
responding to and regulating with concentration balances between their cyto￾plasm and the extracellular fluid.38 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Eyeing the Neuron: Not Just Another Cell
Neurons differ from other cells because they express neuronal specific genes, 
leading to the production of neuronal specific proteins. These proteins result in 
many differences in neuronal cell anatomy, physiology, and function.
Noticing neuron anatomy
The most obvious features of most neurons are their axon- and dendritic￾branching patterns. Most neurons have several primary dendritic branches that 
leave the cell body. These typically divide numerous times forming a tree-likes 
structure often called the dendritic tree or dendritic arborization. Figure 2-4 shows 
two cells from a rabbit retina with very different arborizations.
The dendritic arborization is where neurons typically receive hundreds to thou￾sands of synaptic with inputs. Multiply this by 86 billion neurons and you have 
circuits more complicated than any computer today!

The axon is the typical output structure from the neuron. Usually a single process 
leaves the cell body and branches before forming synapses with hundreds or more 
other neurons. The axon conducts action potentials, electrical signals that travel to 
the presynaptic regions. We provide more information on electrical signaling in 
neurons in Chapters 4 and 5.
A neuron’s dendritic tree may receive thousands of excitatory, inhibitory, and 
modulatory synaptic inputs, each of which may be modulated in a complex pat￾tern over time. The way different inputs to the neuron interact also depends on 
their locations in the dendritic tree.
Understanding what neurons do
What distinguishes neurons from other cells in the body is that they’re excellent 
and specific communicators. Working in circuits, mammalian neurons mediate 
sensation, movement, emotion, survival, and cognition. Underlying these func￾tions are electrical and chemical communication mechanisms that depend on the 
expression of ion channels, and neurotransmitter packaging, release machinery, 
and receptors.
Getting Back to Genetics
Genetics is the study of genes and how they control inheritance. You can typically 
see the results of inheritance in the features of offspring that have received genes 
from each of its parents. The following sections examine genes and inheritance.
Introducing inheritance
Mendelian inheritance is the cornerstones of genetics. Genes determine the fea￾tures, or traits, inherited from your parents. Genes are copied and inherited across 
generations, and different genes cause different traits to present themselves 
(known as phenotypes). Each unique form of a single gene is called an allele. Ani￾mals have two alleles (the version of the gene) for almost every gene, one inherited 
from each parent.
Recognizing phenotype and genotype
The genes within an organism are called its genotype. The set of expressed traits 
of an organism is called its phenotype. An offspring’s phenotype isn’t simply a 
mixing of the traits it received from the two sets of genes it inherited from its 40 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
parents, its genotype. The reason for this is dominant and recessive alleles. Also, 
some traits involve multiple genes.
Determining dominant and recessive traits
In some situations, one allele may completely override the expression of another, 
making this a dominant allele. The non-expressed allele is called the recessive
allele. For a recessive allele to be expressed in an offspring as a trait, the organism 
must receive two copies of the same recessive allele.
For example, the O blood type is recessive to types A and B, which are dominant. 
An AO father and BO mother with A and B blood types could both transmit the 
recessive O allele to their child, producing an OO child (about 25 percent of the 
time), with the O blood type.
Many traits, such as height, depend on several genes. These traits have more 
complicated, mixed inheritance, because a number of genes contributes partially 
to the end trait.
Mutations, which are random changes in genes, can occur. Mutations can convert 
one allele into another or even create a new allele and corresponding trait. Genetic 
mutations are fundamental to evolution because they allow species to change and 
adapt over time.
Each organism has a unique DNA sequence. The only exception is identical twins 
(or identical triplets). In the human population, the total difference in the DNA 
sequence between coding genes is 0.1 percent and total DNA differs by about 
0.6 percent. The difference between a human and a chimpanzee in coding genes is 
about 1.2 percent, with a total difference in DNA of about 4 percent.
Altering the genome: Disorders
It’s amazing that a random shuffle of genes from two parents gets thrown together 
to produce a working nervous system from the proteins encoded. This nervous 
system consists of 86 billion neurons and about the same number of glial cells. 
Neurons can communicate with more than 100 trillion synapses. Of course, the 
process doesn’t always go to plan with perfect results. Sometimes things go wrong.
Some nervous system disorders are genetically based, even though the genetic 
origin may not be identified; small changes in genes and larger chromosome 
anomalies can contribute to these disorders. So, how do genetic disorders happen?
Reproduction starts with germ cells (egg or sperm cells) being generated 
during meiosis. In this process, alternating partial segments from the parents’ CHAPTER 2 Meeting the Building Blocks 41
double-stranded DNA produce the offspring’s unique DNA. In the complex pro￾cess of assembling a single chromosome of DNA from the two parental chromo￾somes, errors can happen. In addition, errors in replication can result in 
spontaneous mutations.
Here are the four most common mutations (single genes or larger regions of 
chromosomes can be affected):
» Point mutation: A point mutation occurs when a single base pair is changed. 
Although many point mutations are benign, others can also have functional 
consequences, including alterations in encoded proteins or changes in gene 
expression.
» Deletion: A piece of a chromosome or partial sequence of DNA may be missing 
from the single chromosome of the egg or sperm, resulting in deletion of the gene.
» Duplication: In duplication, a partial sequence of DNA from one parent is 
replicated twice or more.
» Inversion: When inversion happens, a partial DNA sequence from one parent 
is inserted in the wrong orientation in the offspring.
Genetically based nervous system disorders include sensory problems such as 
blindness and deafness and motor disorders. Other identified genetic disorders 
include Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and Rett syndrome. Chapters  12 
and 18 describes these disorders in more detail.
Disorders that affect cognitive or mental functions are more complex, such as 
autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, 
and depression. Interactions between genes and environment are proposed to be 
the basis of these disorders. Chapter 18 also discusses these disorders.
Neurodevelopmental, neurological, and psychiatric disorders are among the most 
challenging and significant health problems in the United States today. This is 
particularly true for neurodevelopmental disorders like intellectual disability and 
autism spectrum disorders that affect children, neurodegenerative disorders such 
as Alzheimer’s disease that affect the elderly, and depression that affects indi￾viduals in many age groups.
Modifying Genes: Yes or No?
One question that neurobiologists look to answer is whether broken genes can be 
fixed to cure or treat neurological disorders that have genetic components. The 
following sections examine some areas of research.42 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Researching on animals
Major research over the past three decades has involved genetic manipulation of 
animals for experimental models for investigating human disorders. A few animal 
lines have been studied with different genetic compositions that originally arose 
from random mutations in offspring.
Selective genes have been removed (knock-outs), and mutant genes have been 
replaced with normal genes (knock-ins). Many studies have also used brain or 
neuron specific knock-outs or knock-ins to study brain-based disorders.
In genetically modified animal models, scientists modify the genome by changing 
the DNA codons for single amino acids, multiple amino acids, or even entire genes. 
These animal models have provided valuable information about brain disorders 
that have led to the development of effective treatments.
Examining gene therapy
Human gene therapy (the general term for genetic manipulation in humans for 
medical reasons) is currently available primarily for research studies. The FDA has 
approved only a limited number of gene therapy treatments in the United States.
Human genetic manipulation may require silencing a gene that produces a harm￾ful protein and/or adding a gene to produce a functional one. This involves intro￾ducing exogenous DNA into a person’s cells. This DNA may come from another 
organism or be synthesized in a lab. The presence of the blood-brain barrier poses 
a significant obstacle to overcome for gene therapy to treat disorders of the ner￾vous system. But there’s hope.
Delivering the genes
Gene therapy can be conducted in developed organisms in several ways: 
» Physically restrict the injection of the introduced DNA, such as in the eye to 
treat blindness, so that the gene can’t get into any other body cells
» Use a tissue or cell type-specific promoter with the DNA so that it’s only 
expressed in particular tissues
Typically, the introduced DNA is packaged within a vector that’s used to transfer the 
DNA inside cells within the body. One common vector is a modified virus because 
viruses normally function by binding the cell membrane and inserting their DNA or 
RNA into the cell. The contents of a virus can be modified to incorporate a human 
gene. Also, exogenous DNA may be introduced that encodes a therapeutic protein 
that works like a drug rather than the DNA corresponding to any actual human gene.CHAPTER 3 Constructing the Nervous System 43
Chapter 3
Constructing the 
Nervous System
A new life starts when a zygote is formed when two gamete cells are com￾bined in sexual reproduction. The zygote divides and then its daughter 
cells divide many times, migrate, and differentiate to produce the entire 
organism, including the nervous system.
In this chapter, we take you through how the nervous system develops from a 
single fertilized zygote into its final structures and how its components become 
organized. We focus in on the brain’s neocortex. We highlight the generation of 
neuronal and glial cells, axon outgrowth, and synapse formation and refinement. 
Chapter 18 discusses neurodevelopmental disorders.
In eukaryotes, cell division occurs through the process of mitosis, in which the 
DNA is copied and the cellular organelles are divided through cytokinesis. In 
somatic cells, chromosomes exist in pairs — one set of chromosomes is inherited 
from each parent. Humans have 22 pairs of somatic chromosomes (44 total) and 
two sex chromosomes XX (typical female) or XY (typical male).

system44 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Staging Early Development
In the reproductive organs (ovaries and testes), a different kind of cell division 
occurs, called meiosis. It produces haploid cells called gametes or germ cells. During 
meiosis, each gamete receives only one copy of each chromosome. During meio￾sis, chromosome crossover can result in gametes receiving a single chromosome 
that is a mixture of both strands of the two parental chromosomes.
Crossover produces new chromosomes in each gamete. This new chromosome 
contains parts of chromosomes from both of the parents. If the crossover occurs 
within a gene, the DNA section that codes for a protein, a new gene can be pro￾duced. Each egg or sperm that the parent produces is unique. The following sec￾tions examine what occurs after fertilization in the next developmental stages.
Progressing from fertilization
Human development begins when the egg (ovum) is fertilized by the sperm and 
produces a zygote with 46 chromosomes, one set received from each parent. The 
zygote divides by mitosis and creates a group of cells called the inner cell mass 
(ICM) at the blastula stage. The ICM is a totipotent stem cell population, meaning 
that it can give rise to all types of cells in the embryo. The ICM then forms a two 
layered disc of cells called the epiblast and hypoblast that are also totipotent 
stem cells.
Partitioning in gastrulation
During gastrulation, cells in the epiblast undergo mitosis and migration (see 
Figure 3-1).
In the first wave, epiblast cells divide and migrate toward the midline (called the 
primitive streak). After they reach the streak, they crawl through a gap (called the 
primitive groove) and migrate underneath the epiblast cells to form the endoderm. 
The endoderm gives rise to the linings of digestive and respiratory organs.
In the next wave, cells divide and migrate to the midline through the groove and 
on top of the endoderm cells to form the mesoderm. The mesoderm forms the 
musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems. The cells that remain on the top 
divide but don’t migrate and form the ectoderm, which gives rise to the entire 
nervous system and skin.CHAPTER 3 Constructing the Nervous System 45
Specifying the germ layers
Gastrulation also leads to the formation of the three major axes: anterior￾posterior, dorsal-ventral, and medial-lateral. As cells within the gastrula form 
and continue to divide, they become specified, losing totipotency and form 
pluripotent or multipotent stem cells that can give rise to several different tissues 
and organs. Specification involves selective control of gene expression.
One mechanism that controls gene expression is epigenetics, which entails the 
covalent modification of DNA and histones (see Chapter 2). The pattern of epige￾netic modifications becomes altered in subsequent divisions and reduces the 
potency as the cells become specified.
Inducing the neural plate
At the end of gastrulation, a cylinder of mesoderm cells, called the notochord,
forms at the midline. The notochord secretes diffusible molecules called morpho￾gens. These factors bind to target cells, control gene expression, and specify the 
cells to adopt a particular cell fate. Secreted by the notochord, the neural-inducing 
morphogens bind to and specify the overlying medial ectoderm cells to become 
neural ectoderm and form the neural plate. The ectoderm cells farther away from 
the midline don’t bind enough morphogen and become non-neural ectoderm that 
form the skin and related tissues like teeth, hair, and nails.
FIGURE 3-1:

gastrulation and 
neurulation.

The neural-inducing morphogens are secreted proteins called noggin, chordin, and 
follistatin. They act by blocking the action of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). 
BMPs and their receptors are expressed throughout the gastrula where they control 
transcription factors that increase expression of non-neural genes and inhibit 
expression of neural commitment genes. By blocking BMP signaling, the neural￾inducing morphogens increase neural commitment gene expression. Other growth 
factors, such as fibroblast growth factor, are also implicated in neural induction.
Forming the Neural Tube in Neurulation
The next stage, neurulation, involves the transformation of the neural plate into 
the neural tube (see Figure 3-1). In this process, which the following sections dis￾cuss, two longitudinal folds at the edges of the neural plate cause the lateral 
regions to elevate, forming a neural groove between the folds. The neural groove 
deepens, which causes the neural folds to come together at the dorsal midline.
Closing the neural tube
The neural folds join through cell-cell adhesion, which closes the neural tube.
Ectodermal cells at the outer margins of the neural fold coalesce at the dorsal 
aspect of the tube and become the neural crest cells. The non-neural ectoderm 
joins to form a sheet above the neural crest and neural tube. The neural tube gives 
rise to neurons and glia in the central nervous system (CNS), while the neural 
crest gives rise to neurons and glia in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The 
non-neural ectoderm forms the skin and related structures.
Failure of the neural tube to close normally can produce neural tube defects, which 
are the most common congenital birth defects affecting the nervous system. 
Chapter 12 describes neural tube defects.
Separating into regions
After the neural tube closes, the cephalic (anterior) end of the tube divides into 
three vesicles:
» Forebrain: The forebrain (also referred to as the prosencephalon) divides into 
the following:
• Telencephalon (cerebrum): The telencephalon consists of the cerebral 
cortex and underlying white matter (derived from the dorsal telencephalon, 
or pallium) and the basal ganglia (derived from the ventral telencephalon, CHAPTER 3 Constructing the Nervous System 47
or subpallium). The amygdala is derived from both the pallium and 
subpallium.
• Diencephalon: This consists of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and retina.
» Midbrain: The midbrain (also called the mesencephalon) doesn’t divide further, 
though there are a specialized areas within it. The midbrain consists of the 
tectum, tegmentum, and cerebral peduncles, among other structures.
» Hindbrain: The hindbrain (also known as the rhombencephalon) divides into 
the following:
• Metencephalon: The pons and cerebellum develop from the 
metencephalon.
• Myelencephalon: The myelencephalon forms the medulla.
During development, the mammalian hindbrain is composed of eight 
swellings called rhombomeres.
A second morphological change further divides the forebrain and hindbrain. In 
Figure 3-2, you can see these main vesicles and the embryonic nervous system at 
several key stages.
The walls of the neural tube vesicles give rise to the neurons and glial cells in the 
CNS. The fluid filled inside becomes the brain’s ventricle system. The posterior 
part of the neural tube forms the spinal cord and its cavity becomes the central 
canal.
FIGURE 3-2:

developing 
nervous system.

In cold-blooded vertebrates such as amphibians and reptiles, the three brain ves￾icles are approximately equal in size, as they are in early mammalian ontogeny. 
However, in mammals, the forebrain became increasingly enlarged during evolu￾tion, becoming the dominant percentage of total brain mass, especially in pri￾mates and large mammalian species.
After the neural tube has closed and undergone the morphological changes to 
form the vesicles, the cells of the neural tube proliferate, migrate, and differenti￾ate. These developmental processes have been well studied in the developing 
cerebral cortex.
Meeting the neocortex
Older types of cerebral cortex include archicortex and paleocortex (together 
referred to as allocortex) and mesocortex in the limbic system (refer to Chapter 11). 
The neocortex evolved in mammals and is the most recent cerebral cortex to 
evolve. The neocortex consists of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory 
GABAergic neurons arranged in six layers. The layers are numbered from the outer 
layer 1 at the surface, to layer 6 at the border with the underlying cerebral white 
matter.
The entire neocortex develops using a common set of developmental programs. 
These programs generate structures capable of processing inputs from all five 
senses, executing programs for voluntary motor control, and providing language 
and executive functions.
Producing Neural Cells
After closure of the neural tube, the tube is a single layer of neural stem cells, 
called neuroepithelial cells (NECs). The entire brain and spinal cord develop from the 
NECs. The NECs first undergo symmetrical divisions to self-renew in the ventric￾ular zone, the region adjacent to the developing ventricles. After a sufficient num￾ber of NECs are formed, the NECs divide asymmetrically to form a daughter NEC 
and a daughter progenitor cell, called a radial glial cell (RGC) or radial glial 
progenitor.
RGCs were named because they initially express astrocyte cell markers and some 
RGCs guide the migration of developing neurons. However, RGCs are the neural 
progenitors that form all the excitatory glutamatergic neurons and some glia in 
the cerebral cortex. There are different subtypes of progenitors, including apical 
RGCs that self-renew and can also give rise to basal RGCs and intermediate pro￾genitor cells (iPCs).CHAPTER 3 Constructing the Nervous System 49
Early in cortical development some apical RGCs extend a process all the way to the 
outer region, called the pial surface, and provide the guidance for migrating cells. 
Apical RGCs are located in the ventricular zone, basal RGCs are found in the adja￾cent subventricular zone, and iPCs can be located in both regions. The following 
sections discuss the migration of RGCs along radial glia.
Migrating along radial glia
In one type of division, an apical RGC can give rise to a daughter apical RGC and a 
daughter neuron, sometimes called a neuroblast. The neuron migrates to its spe￾cific layer in the cortex, using the processes of RGCs to guide it along its path. As 
development proceeds, other neurons are generated from basal RGCs and iPCs.
As the cerebral cortex develops, it forms in an inside-out manner, which means 
that the deepest layer 6 forms first, then layer 5, layer 4, and so on. The neurons 
that form the outer layers must migrate past the neurons that have already formed 
the inner layers. After neurons have reached their final position in their cortical 
layer, they differentiate into a specific neuronal type.
Research suggests that each RGC, and the neurons produced from it, form a fun￾damental unit of organization called the cortical minicolumn. A minicolumn con￾sists of about 100 neurons that are interconnected vertically through the six 
cortical layers in a standard way. Figure 3-3 depicts minicolumns at various stages 
of the development of the neocortex. Several hundred million minicolumns con￾stitute the neocortex in humans. We provide more information on cortical mini￾columns in Chapter 11.
Generating inhibitory interneurons
Cortical excitatory glutamatergic neurons are produced from RGCs in the dorsal 
region of the telencephalon segment of the neural tube. In contrast, cortical 
GABAergic inhibitory interneurons are generated from a ventral tube subregion 
called the ganglionic eminence (GE). Inhibitory interneurons migrate tangentially 
(parallel to the ventricular surface) to reach their appropriate location in the cor￾tex, independent of radial glial fibers. They migrate into the developing cortical 
layers after excitatory neurons have migrated to their specific layers.
In the cerebral cortex and most brain regions, neurogenesis occurs primarily pre￾natally. In a few brain regions, particularly the cerebellum and hippocampus, 
neurogenesis continues postnatally. In the adult brain generation of new 
neurons (adult neurogenesis) occurs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and 
olfactory bulb.50 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Going to gliogenesis
RGCs also give rise to glial cells, which are important in myelination, supporting 
neurons, surrounding the blood brain barrier, and producing the ventricles (refer 
to Chapter  1). A subpopulation of RGCs generate ependymal cells that line the 
ventricles and form the choroid plexus. In the developing neocortex, gliogenesis 
typically follows neurogenesis and gives rise to oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. 
However, the mechanisms underlying the switch from neurogenesis to gliogene￾sis or the identity of the RGCs haven’t been well characterized.
A pool of neural stem or progenitor cells is maintained in the cerebral cortex post￾natally and into adulthood. Neural stem or progenitor cells in the subventricular 
zone may give rise to new glial cells to replace damaged glia. They may also give 
rise to brain tumors, especially gliomas, the most common malignant primary 
brain tumor. Brain tumors cause an estimated 19,000 cancer-related deaths in the 
United States each year. Research to identify the stem or progenitor origin of brain 
tumors may lead to early detection techniques and the design of therapies to treat 
brain cancer.

Differentiating at Journey’s End
As development progresses the RGCs give rise to cells that are postmitotic and 
committed to a neuronal or glial fate. The committed cells then differentiate into 
specific types of neurons and glia. Differentiation involves regulation of gene 
expression, which determines the cell’s phenotype. Chapter  2 examines the 
mechanisms that control gene expression.
As the neural tube develops, morphogens are released by specific groups of cells 
in the embryo, and gradients of morphogens are formed along the anterior poste￾rior and dorsal ventral axes of the developing tube. The morphogen receptors in 
the NECs, RGCs, and developing neurons and glia lead to the control of gene 
expression. Through their receptors, these morphogens help to determine the 
types of neurons and glial cells that will develop in specific CNS areas. One way 
that gene expression is controlled is through transcription, which we describe in 
the following sections.
Switching programs with 
transcription factors
Researchers have identified several important morphogens and transcription in 
the developing neocortex. Following neurulation, inhibition of the Wnt (ligand in 
the wingless pathway) pathway is required for specification of the cerebral cortex 
in the telencephalon. Initially, in the developing neural tube, the delta-notch sig￾naling pathway, which regulates a family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription 
factors, promotes the self-renewal of NECs and RGCs.
After enough NECs and RGCs are produced, inhibition of delta-notch signaling in 
RGCs is then required to activate specific proneural gene expression and the for￾mation of neurons. Proneural genes also contribute to the neuron–glia fate deci￾sion. The initial self-renewal and then the switch to neurogenesis and gliogenesis 
are essential for generation of brain structures of appropriate size and shape by 
controlling the timing of proliferation and differentiation.
In the developing neocortex, additional transcription factors, including members 
of the Otx, Emx, Sox, and Pax families, show differential expression and contrib￾ute to the development of functional areas of the cerebral cortex, including sen￾sory, motor, and cognitive regions.
Differentiation has an important impact on the morphology of neurons and glia. 
When neurons differentiate, they also synthesize proteins and activate pathways 
that lead to the outgrowth of axons and dendrites, and later to the formation of 
synapses.52 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Establishing cortical neurons
Pyramidal (glutamatergic) neurons are located in the cerebral cortex (including 
neocortex, mesocortex, and allocortex such as the hippocampus). They have 
pyramid-shaped somas, one large apical and several basal dendrites, and many 
dendritic spines. Pyramidal neurons are the main output neurons from the 
neocortex. The other glutamatergic neurons in the neocortex are stellate neurons, 
which also have dendritic spines but extend their axons locally within the 
neocortex.
Inhibitory (GABAergic) interneurons have dense, local inhibitory connections. 
Researchers have identified numerous types of neocortical inhibitory interneu￾rons that differ in their neuropeptide expression and morphologies. Inhibitory 
interneurons provide modulation of neural activity in diverse ways that endow 
neocortical circuits with enhanced computational power. Chapter 11 describes the 
inputs to, outputs from and connections among neurons in the neocortex.
Neural progenitor cells differentiate during cortical development into different 
neuronal types and locations in the neocortex that have specific connections and 
functions.
The organization of the neocortex allowed the brain to enlarge rapidly during evo￾lution because of its ability to represent different types of inputs, process those 
inputs, and communicate with other areas of cortex in a standard way. Cognitive 
enhancements in multiple senses and motor control evolved by devoting more 
area at a given stage of processing for higher acuity and more areas for greater 
sophistication of processing.
Extending and Guiding Axons 
and Dendrites
When newly generated neurons arrive at their specific cortical layer during develop￾ment (or even before they arrive), they begin to differentiate and extend an axon 
and form dendrites. As the axon and dendrites grow out, they also branch. These 
branches are essential for the formation of synapses and functional neural circuits.
A specialized structure at the tip of the axon is the growth cone. It senses molecular 
cues in the environment through specific receptors and guides the axon toward its 
target. Activated receptors signal to the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons and 
their motor proteins. This results in the movement of the growth cone. Dendrites 
also contain growth cones at their ends and may employ similar mechanisms for 
outgrowth.CHAPTER 3 Constructing the Nervous System 53
The majority of inhibitory neurons and many excitatory neurons connect locally 
within the neocortex. Extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules 
are involved in axon guidance and targeting for connections among neurons 
within the neocortex. The next sections delve deeper into axon guidance cues.
Detecting the cues
Cortical pyramidal neurons extend their axons out to other cortical or subcortical 
regions. Little is known about the factors that guide axons into or out of the mam￾malian neocortex. Studies in animal models, such as the developing chick spinal 
cord and frog retina, have identified axon guidance cues. Cues can act as attrac￾tants that guide the axon toward its correct target or as repellants that push the 
axon away from the wrong target.
Guidance cues include both short- and long-range types. Short-range (tethered) 
cues are proteins in the extracellular matrix, such as laminin and fibronectin, or 
plasma-membrane located proteins such as the cell-adhesion proteins like cad￾herins. Long-range cues are secreted proteins that form gradients in the extracel￾lular environment. Identified diffusible guidance cues (and their receptors) 
include netrins (DCC and Unc5), Slit (Robo), ephrins (Eph receptors), and sema￾phorins (plexins and neuropilins). Some morphogens such as BMPs, FGF, and 
Wnts also participate in growth cone guidance.
Morphological differentiation involves elaborating and branching a neuron’s axo￾nal projection. This process is mediated by molecular cues in the environment 
that are detected by receptors on the axon growth cone. The axon elongates and 
the growth cone moves toward attractants or away from repellents.
Competing for survival
During development, more neurons are produced than will be needed in the adult 
nervous system. In order to survive, neurons depend on survival factors and/or 
forming synaptic connections. Neurons that don’t receive survival factors or syn￾aptic connections undergo a type of programmed cell death called apoptosis. An 
estimated one third to one half of all neurons initially produced in the brain may 
undergo apoptosis. This loss ensures the right match between the neuronal popu￾lation and its targets and prevents the formation of unnecessary or inefficient 
synapses, and erroneous circuits.
Trophic factors bind to receptors and support neuronal survival. Developing axons 
compete for binding of target-derived trophic factors. Axons (and the neurons 
they are connected to) that don’t receive enough trophic signaling or don’t form 
synapses don’t survive. Target-derived trophic factors include the neurotrophins, 54 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
such as nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3 and 4, and brain-derived neuro￾trophic factor (BDNF), as well as several morphogens, growth factors, and even 
neurotransmitters and neuropeptides.
As soon as functional synaptic connections have formed, activity can also contrib￾ute to neuronal survival, possibly through the release of additional trophic factors. 
Some trophic factors, such as BDNF, have been shown to function in neuroplasti￾city in the adult brain.
Establishing the Synapses
As neurons differentiate, their dendrites undergo extensive branching and form 
dendritic trees. Many dendrites protrude dendritic spines. This morphology 
increases the area and number of synapses that can form on the dendrite. Den￾dritic branches and spines express specific cell adhesion and secreted proteins 
that attract a growing axon branch.
In invertebrates, this wiring process is almost completely genetically programmed, 
with several thousand identically laid neurons with almost the same synapses 
from animal to animal. In vertebrates, however, and mammals, in particular, 
things are more complicated.
After an axon has reached its correct target, a synapse can form in a process called 
synaptogenesis that occurs prenatally and postnatally, and even in adulthood. The 
synapse is the place where communication occurs between a neuron and its tar￾get, which can be another neuron, a muscle cell, or a gland. Synapses between 
neurons are the basis of pathways, systems, and circuits that mediate sensory 
perception, motor output that produces behaviors, and cognitive functions such 
as language and memory.
Chapters 5 and 6 provide more information on synaptic transmission. The follow￾ing sections describe the mechanisms of how synaptogenesis occurs and how 
synapses are refined.
Beginning the contact
In synaptogenesis in the CNS, the axonal growth cone contacts the postsynaptic 
neuron. If the growth cone approaches a dendrite, a small protrusion on the den￾drite called a filopodium attracts the growth cone and helps initiate synapse for￾mation. This contact sends a signal back along the axon that instructs the growth 
cone to develop into a presynaptic region.CHAPTER 3 Constructing the Nervous System 55
Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic regions become specialized by localizing 
proteins in and near the plasma membrane. Some presynaptic proteins, such as 
the synaptic vesicle, release machinery and ion channels, and some postsynaptic 
proteins, like receptors and scaffolds, are delivered to the developing synapses in 
preassembled packets.
Formation of the synapse also involves attachment of cell adhesion molecules 
across the cleft. These include neuroligin and neurexin, synCAMs, cadherins, 
ephrins, and Eph receptors, which connect the presynaptic to the postsynaptic 
region. Some synapses can become active rapidly after synapse formation, but it 
typically takes several hours or longer for synapses to mature and become 
functional.
Refining synapses
Axon guidance and targeting aren’t perfect. Neurons may form synapses with 
both their intended and unintended targets, or more synaptic connections may 
form than are needed. It’s important that the right connections be maintained and 
the wrong or redundant connects be removed. During development, newly formed 
synapses are modified through a process called synaptic refinement where they can 
be strengthened, weakened, or eliminated.
Initial synapse formation doesn’t depend on neuronal activity. However, activity 
is required to maintain a synapse. The inactive or low activity synapses are 
removed. Active synapses are maintained and may be strengthened. Sensory input 
and behavioral circuits lead to activity-dependent mechanisms for the develop￾ment of neural circuits and connectivity maps. Many inactive or low activity syn￾apses that form during prenatal and postnatal periods will be removed between 
early childhood and adolescence.
During development, there are specific windows of time when experiences have a 
greater impact on the development of particular systems and circuits, referred as 
developmental sensitive periods and critical periods. These are the time windows 
when experiences and neuronal activity strengthen important connections. 
They’re also the time windows when a lack of experience and neuronal activity 
can lead to loss of synapses and possible permanent loss of circuits in specific 
brain regions for a particular skill or function.
Synaptic refinement and circuit formation occur and peak at different developmen￾tal times for different brain systems and circuits. The critical period for develop￾ment of the auditory and visual systems is during the first postnatal 6 to 9 months. 
The critical period for development of language is between 6 to 12 months. Higher 
cognitive functions continue to develop throughout childhood and adolescence.56 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Strengthening synapses
The nervous system, including the brain, develops by pruning neurons and con￾nections that don’t end up with significant activity. Researchers don’t know 
exactly how the nervous system determines what is significant in the connectivity 
of individual neurons. It may be the total number of connections compared to 
neighbors. The brain also develops by altering the strength of connections between 
neurons.
The idea that synapses can change strength was proposed by Donald Hebb in the 
1940s and the type of change he envisioned is called Hebbian plasticity. The con￾cept in Hebbian plasticity is that coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity 
leads to changes in the strength of synapses. It’s widely accepted as a mechanism 
by which information can be encoded and retained in neurons in the brain. Heb￾bian plasticity is proposed to play an important role in development and memory.
Synapse refinement and Hebbian plasticity also occur in the adult brain, where 
they’re often referred to as synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is proposed as an 
essential mechanism that underlies the encoding of memory by the hippocampus, 
amygdala, and cerebellum and may be involved in cortical remapping following 
practice and injury. Disruption of synaptic plasticity may also occur in disorders 
such as depression. Chapter 15 describes the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.
Mapping out the cortex
The primary visual cortex contains a map in which adjacent retinal ganglion cells 
relay through the thalamus to adjacent cortical cells. Similarly, the somatosensory 
system has an orderly, although distorted, map of the body and face on the neo￾cortex. Early in development, projections are produced from different sensory 
nuclei in the thalamus to the appropriate part of the neocortex. These genetically 
specified maps are later refined by activity-dependent mechanisms.
Competing for cortical space
Within any given sense, and between senses, there’s competition for cortical area. 
Research shows that if one area of a cortical map is deprived of its input, other, 
usually adjacent, inputs will begin to activate it. Important research today is ask￾ing the question of whether this new activation comes from inputs that were 
always there, but silent, or whether new inputs grow into a denervated area. The 
answer depends on whether the deprivation occurs during development before 
critical periods, or afterward.CHAPTER 3 Constructing the Nervous System 57
Wiring in the visual system
Synaptic modification occurs according to correlated activity in the pre- and post￾synaptic elements of synapses. In the case of cortical maps, consider two ganglion 
cells that are adjacent to each other in the retina with receptive fields that overlap 
to some degree. Objects projected onto this area of the retina tend to affect both 
nearby ganglion cells and produce similar light distributions in the receptive fields 
of both nearby ganglion cells, so that their firing tends to be correlated.
When the axons of these ganglion cells reach the thalamus, they initially branch 
extensively and try to innervate many targets. But over time, because the axons of 
adjacent ganglion cells tend to be correlated with each other and with target cells 
they both innervate, their synaptic weights onto those target cells are increased. 
Meanwhile, the weights of distant uncorrelated ganglion cells don’t get weight 
increases when they innervate the same target.
The initial projection from the retina to the thalamus is approximately ordered by 
the guidance cues. Coincident activity ensures that the final wiring forms a good 
map. During development of the visual system  — before the retina even has 
photoreceptors  — waves of organized self-induced spontaneous firing move 
across the retina constantly to produce a position-dependent internally generated 
correlated firing. This process repeats itself at every level of the nervous system, 
through many stages of neocortical processing.
In humans, after infancy, activity dependent synaptic refinement leads to changes 
in synaptic numbers and strengths. Myelination of axon tracts also has a signifi￾cant developmental timescale that extends through early adulthood. In the adult 
brain synaptic plasticity occurs in several regions and has been implicated in 
learning and memory and recovery following injury.
Myelinating into Adulthood
In axon myelination, axons are wrapped with myelin membranes to make action 
potential conduction faster, more efficient, and more reliable. Myelination begins 
in the late prenatal period and continues until early adulthood. The last parts of 
the brain to be fully myelinated are the frontal lobes, the areas of the brain most 
needed for abstract thought and judgment.
Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the CNS.  They develop from 
oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) during gliogenesis in development and in 
the adult. Axons that are larger than 1 micrometer in diameter and long axons 
from projection/principal neurons are usually myelinated. One oligodendrocyte 58 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
can myelinate multiple axons. The majority of oligodendrocytes are located in 
white matter, but a few are also found in gray matter. They also provide metabolic 
and trophic support of axons.
Damage to an oligodendrocyte or its myelin membranes can lead to loss of motor 
or sensory functions. The most common demyelinating disorder is multiple scle￾rosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder that leads to myelin degeneration. We exam￾ine MS in Chapter 12.
Here we discuss the meninges, which are membranes that form around the CNS 
during development and provide protection and regulation of the cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF).
Covering the CNS with meninges
The meninges, three membrane layers that form around the developing neural 
tube and that form the mesoderm, protect the CNS:
» Outermost layer: This layer is the dura mater, which is composed of dense 
fibrous tissue and is attached to the skull in specific places. It contains a few 
large blood vessels.
» Middle layer: This layer is the arachnoid matter that consists of a membrane 
of fibrous tissue that resorbs (transports) CSF.
» Innermost layer: This thin membrane is the pia mater and follows the brain 
surface and spinal cord. Blood vessels pass through the pia mater to the brain 
and spinal cord.
The meninges may also play a role in the development of the nervous system. 
They release diffusible factors that affect neural progenitor cells. They also help 
set up the pial basement membrane that forms a base for radial fibers of neuro￾epithelial stem cells. Errors in development, injuries, or infections that affect the 
meninges may contribute to hydrocephalus.
Hydrocephalus is caused by an abnormal accumulation of CSF in the brain’s ven￾tricles, which leads to high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus can be caused by 
the following:
» Congenital malformations that block normal drainage of the fluid from 
the meninges
» Overproduction of CSF
» Complications of head injuries or brain infectionsCHAPTER 3 Constructing the Nervous System 59
Symptoms in less severe cases include nausea, vomiting, and sleepiness. In more 
severe cases, hydrocephalus can be associated with mental disability, convulsions, 
and even death from brainstem compression.
Completing the PNS
Neurons and glia of the PNS are produced from neural crest cells (NCCs) induced 
from ectoderm as the neural tube closes (see Figure 3-1). NCCs differentiate as 
they migrate away from the dorsal neural tube.
The location of NCCs along the neural tube determines the adult structure they 
will form. Cranial NCCs form components of cranial nerves and cranial ganglia 
while trunk NCCs give rise to components of spinal nerves and ganglia outside the 
spinal cord. NCCs give rise to a variety of neurons, including somatosensory and 
visceral sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia and cranial ganglia, neurons in the 
sympathetic and parasympathetic (autonomic) ganglia, and enteric nervous 
system.
NCCs produce the glial cells in the PNS, Schwann cells, and satellite cells. NCCs 
also give rise to numerous non-neural cells, including the pigmented melanocytes 
of the skin, the adrenal medulla, the thymus gland, facial structures, cartilage, 
and connective tissue in the heart.
During development, small islands of neural ectoderm are also located in regions 
of non-neural ectoderm after the neural tube closes, called neural placodes. They 
give rise to olfactory and auditory sensory neurons, lens of the eye, and anterior 
pituitary, and contribute to several cranial ganglia.
Disrupting Development
The developing nervous system is built using intrinsic genetic programs, but cells 
are also influenced by their environment. Development has incredible fidelity, but 
it’s also fragile. Both genetic changes that are inherited or arise spontaneously, 
and environmental insults can disrupt brain development.
The embryo is particularly susceptible to foreign chemicals, pathogens, and meta￾bolic disruption because the developing cells are responding to chemical gradients 
in the environment, regulating gene expression, and forming new structures. 
Environmental substances or infectious agents that have little effect on adults or 
late fetal development can have profound effects on early embryonic develop￾ment. The general term for a substance or effector that causes birth defects is a 
teratogen.60 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Congenital brain disorders are defined as structural or functional anomalies that 
occur during prenatal development. Neural tube defects, cerebral palsy and hydro￾cephalus are three examples.
Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of conditions in which the growth and 
development of the brain is affected. They can impact an individual’s behavior, 
self-control, emotions, and cognitive functions including language, executive 
functions, and learning and memory. Neurodevelopmental disorders include 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, intel￾lectual disability, cerebral palsy, and sensory impairments. Many neurodevelop￾mental disorders result from interactions between genetic and environmental 
factors. Chapter 18 describes neurodevelopmental disorders in more detail. These 
sections discuss several processes that occur during aging and their effects on the 
function of the brain.
Aging cells
Aging is a complex process. It involves mechanisms that range from the subcel￾lular level to the whole organism. The telomeres at the end of chromosomes inside 
the nucleus of cells appear to be capable of only a finite number of divisions. In the 
body, each time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten until they become too short 
for the cell to divide any more. The cell then may become inactive or die. Because 
most neurons in the brain are postmitotic, telomere shortening probably isn’t a 
mechanism in brain aging. Joints wear out and blood vessels harden or get clogged 
with deposits at the whole organism level. Tissues and organs of the body can mal￾function, which can adversely affect other parts of the body including the brain.
During normal adulthood, cell numbers and structure in the brain are generally 
stable. The encoding of memories primarily involves modification of synaptic 
strengths, although neurons in areas such as the hippocampus continue to be 
replaced at low levels. The number of neurons starts to decline at middle age 
because of the accumulation of protein aggregates, toxins, and metabolic errors. 
These can be influenced by genetic and environmental factors that accelerate 
neuronal injury and degeneration.
Aging and brain dysfunction
Most athletic and raw cognitive ability functions peak in the mid- to late 20s. 
Cognitive capabilities, such as executive functions associated with knowledge and 
wisdom, continue to increase beyond this age. Aging is a major risk factor for 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, 
and vascular disease that affects the brain. Both genetic and environmental 
factors appear to be involved in these disorders. We provide more details about 
Parkinson’s disease in Chapter 12 and Alzheimer’s disease in Chapter 15.CHAPTER 4 Modulating Membrane Potentials 61

f we told you that your brain is full of batteries, you’d probably wonder if we 
were insulting your intelligence or just plain crazy. But after you read this 
chapter, you’ll see that neither is the case! Your brain’s neurons are cells that 
specialize in rapid and precise electrical communication, integration, and pro￾cessing of information. In order for neurons to perform these wonderfully com￾plex tasks, they require a number of different components, such as membrane ion 
transporters and ion channels. In this chapter, we explore how neurons establish 
the resting membrane potential and how they change the membrane potential in 
synaptic responses and the action potential.
Getting the Membrane Potential
A typical electrical circuit involves the movement of electrons in wires. However, 
in cells, electrical signaling involves the separation and movement of ions in solu￾tion. Ions are atoms with positive or negative electrical charges. Neurobiologists 
are interested in sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium ions. Aqueous solutions

are less conductive than wires, but they’re good enough for the small distances 
that ions need to move across and along the membrane.
The membrane potential refers to the difference in electrical charge between the 
inside and outside of the plasma membrane. For a cell to produce a membrane 
potential it needs ion transporters and ion channels. Ion transporters create an 
unequal distribution of ions across the membrane. Ion channels allow ion cur￾rents to flow across the membrane.
All cells have a resting membrane potential. However, only neurons and muscle 
cells use changes in their membrane potential as a major mechanism for com￾munication or responses. Neurons employ several different types of electrical sig￾nals to encode and transfer information. In general they’re called either graded or 
action potentials, which we discuss in the section “Changing the Membrane 
Potential” later in this chapter. Here we examine the resting membrane potential.
Resting with the membrane potential
Neurons have a difference in ionic concentrations between the inside cytoplasm 
versus the extracellular fluid outside the neuron. Ion transporters that use energy 
in the form of ATP create this difference in specific ion concentrations across the 
membrane. Ion channels allow the flow of specific ions back across the mem￾brane. The most important ions that control the membrane potential are sodium 
(Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-).
When a neuron isn’t receiving synaptic inputs or generating outputs, it’s at rest. 
At rest, current through constituently open (leak) ion channels generate a con￾stant voltage across the neuronal plasma membrane. Because the neuronal mem￾brane is an insulator separating two conductors (the inside ionic solution versus 
the outside), it has capacitance. This capacitance is charged to the potential cre￾ated by the leak ionic currents. In the membrane, there are many more leak potas￾sium channels present than leak chloride or leak sodium channels. This results in 
the inside of the membrane having a negative electrical charge compared to the 
outside, between –60 mV to –70 mV at rest.
At rest, negative charges are concentrated inside the membrane and positive 
charges are concentrated outside. The membrane potential exists only within a 
few nanometers at the surface of the plasma membrane. These charge differences 
involve only a tiny fraction of the total charges in the solutions. Because they’re 
localized at the surface of the membrane and because the membrane is thin, they 
produce a significant electrical potential across the membrane.
We discuss more about the membrane potential in the section “Establishing the 
Membrane Potential with Leak Channels” later in this chapter. Here we describe 
how neurons form the ion concentration gradients.CHAPTER 4 Modulating Membrane Potentials 63
Actively moving ions with transporters
Ion concentration gradients are established by membrane proteins called active 
transporters, which actively move ions into or out of cells. Primary active trans￾porters use ATP hydrolysis to provide the energy to move ions against their con￾centration gradients. For the membrane potential, the sodium-potassium 
transporter is essential. It’s also called a pump because it pumps sodium and 
potassium up their concentration gradients, or an ATPase, because it hydrolyzes 
ATP. From here, we call it the sodium-potassium pump.
The sodium-potassium pump transports three sodium ions out for every two 
potassium ions transported in. With each cycle, the pump hydrolyzes one mole￾cule of ATP. The outside extracellular fluid throughout the body resembles seawa￾ter, with high sodium and low potassium concentrations. Through the action of 
this pump, the inside cytoplasm has the opposite: low sodium and high potassium 
concentrations.
The sodium-potassium pump runs constantly, using ATP to create a disequilib￾rium or imbalance in the sodium and potassium concentrations across the mem￾brane, as you can see in Figure 4-1.

Storing Energy in Ion Gradients
In addition to the sodium-potassium pump, there are two additional primary 
active transporters in neurons: 
» The calcium pump uses ATP hydrolysis to pump calcium from the inside to the 
outside of the neuron.
» A proton (H+) pump is also present at the plasma membrane to keep the pH 
of the intracellular cytoplasm constant.
Many other negative and positive ions are present inside and outside neurons. 
How are their gradients produced? Neurons express secondary active transport￾ers. They don’t hydrolyze ATP. Instead, they use another ion gradient to provide 
the energy to move an ion up/against its concentration gradient. The sodium￾calcium exchanger allows sodium to move down its gradient into the neuron while 
actively moving calcium out of the neuron. Chloride is transported by cation￾chloride co-transporters, like the potassium-chloride cotransporter.
Other ions and molecules, such as bicarbonate, phosphate, glucose, and amino 
acids are transported into cells using secondary active transporters. Away from 
the membrane, the total charges in the overall extracellular and intracellular 
solutions are balanced. In addition, the overall total number of solutes (charged 
and uncharged atoms and molecules) are the same inside and out so that the 
osmotic pressure is balanced.
In addition to transporters that form the ion gradients, neurons also need use ion 
channels to produce and change the membrane potential. Here we discuss the ion 
channels.
Facilitating ion movement with channels
The ionic imbalances created by the transporter-pumps allow neurons to function 
as batteries, capable of producing electrical currents, the movement of ions that 
flow through ion channels in the membrane. The biophysical term for the ability 
to conduct ion flow through the membrane is called its permeability, analogous to 
the electrical unit conductance. The presence of ion pumps and ion channels in the 
cell membrane make neurons electrical signaling devices.
Ion channels are membrane proteins that, when they’re open, allow the move￾ment of selective ions across the membrane. Ion channels don’t need energy or 
ATP because selective ions are typically diffusing down (along) their concentra￾tion and/or voltage gradient. The two main categories of ion channels areCHAPTER 4 Modulating Membrane Potentials 65
» Leak channels: Also referred to as ungated, leak channels are constitutively 
open, even at rest. Refer to the later section “Establishing the Resting 
Membrane Potential with Leak Channels” for more information.
» Gated channels: The majority of gated channels are closed at rest and 
require a specific stimulus in order to be opened. We discuss this topic more 
in the section “Changing the Membrane Potential” later in this chapter.
What happens when an ion gradient is present and ion channels are open? The 
active transporters have produced a concentration gradient. If an ion channel is 
open in the membrane, ions tend to diffuse from the higher concentration side to 
the lower concentration side. They also tend to move according to the voltage 
gradient, with positive ions outside attracted to the negative voltage inside, for 
example.
Thus, the two forces acting on an ion are the force of chemical diffusion and force 
of electrical charge. Together, these forces are known as the electrochemical 
gradient or the driving force.
The reciprocal of the membrane permeability is its resistance. By ohms law, 
V = I*R (voltage = current times resistance), each ionic current through the mem￾brane resistance produces a voltage. The net membrane voltage is the sum of the 
contributions of all ionic currents.
Ions continue to flow through an opened ion channel down the chemical gradient 
until the opposing electrical gradient caused by the membrane capacitance bal￾ances the chemical gradient force.
When the chemical and electrical gradients are equal in magnitude, the ion is said 
to be in electrochemical equilibrium, and there will be no further ion movement. The 
membrane potential that’s established at equilibrium is called the  equilibrium 
potential (Ex
) for that ion with a specific concentration gradient.
Calculating the equilibrium potential: 
The Nernst equation
The equilibrium potential for an ion gradient can be calculated using the Nernst 
equation — developed from basic thermodynamic principles by the 19th-century 
German chemist Walter Nernst. The Nernst equation gives the Nernst-equilibrium 
potential for an ion x (Ex):
Ex
 = 58 mV/z * log10 ([ion]outside/[ion]inside)66 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
The constant 58 mV comes from the evaluation of several other constants RT/F, 
where R = universal gas constant, T= temperature in Kelvin (here room tempera￾ture), and F = Faraday constant. In the equation, * means multiplied by, / means 
divided by, and log10 means the base 10 log. The variables in the equation are z = 
ion valance (charge of the ion), and [ion]outside and [ion]inside the ion concentrations 
outside and inside the neuron.
In a typical mammalian neuron, the concentration of sodium (valence = +1) is ~ 
150 mM outside, 15 mM inside. The Nernst-equilibrium potential = 58 mV/+1 * 
log10 ([150/15]) = + 58 mV.
In a typical mammalian neuron, the concentration of potassium (valence = +1) 
is ~ 5 mM outside, 100 mM inside. The Nernst-equilibrium potential = 58 mV/+1 * 
log10 ([5/100]) = –75 mV. Note the log of a fraction is negative; potassium has a 
negative Nernst-equilibrium potential.
In a typical mammalian neuron, the concentration of chloride (valence = –1) 
is ~150 mM outside and 13 mM inside. The Nernst-equilibrium potential = 
58 mV/–1 * log10 ([150/13]) = –65 mV.  Note the valence of chloride is –1 and 
chloride has a negative Nernst-equilibrium potential, close to the resting mem￾brane potential.
Establishing the Resting Membrane 
Potential with Leak Channels
In addition to ion concentration gradients produced by ion transporters, at rest 
the membrane contains leak channels that are constitutively open. Leak channels 
allow ions to move from regions of higher to lower concentration by diffusion. 
Leak potassium, sodium, and chloride channels are open at rest.
Why is the resting membrane potential negative on the inside of the membrane? 
The simple reason is because at rest, there are many more leak potassium and 
chloride channels in the plasma membrane than others, such a sodium. This dif￾ference in the number of leak channels at rest is produced by gene expression. 
There are about 20 to 40 times more leak potassium channels expressed than leak 
sodium channels, whereas there are two to four times more potassium leak chan￾nels than leak chloride channels.
Why is the resting membrane potential between −60 mV to −70 mV? The potas￾sium leak current predominates at rest, driving the membrane potential to the 
–75 mV potassium Nernst-equilibrium potential. The resting membrane potential CHAPTER 4 Modulating Membrane Potentials 67
is close to, but not quite as negative as the potassium Nernst-equilibrium poten￾tial because of leakage chloride channels. They tend to clamp the membrane at 
their Nernst-reversal potential, typically near –65 mV.
The sodium-potassium pump contributes a small amount to the resting mem￾brane potential. It transports two potassium ions into the cell for every three 
sodium ions that are pumped out. It’s electrogenic, which could cause a net increase 
in one positively charged sodium ion outside the cell for each round of pumping. 
However, many of the extra sodium ions are used immediately by secondary active 
transporters. In addition, pumps act much more slowly than ion channels, so the 
current produced by the pump is quite small. The sodium-potassium pump con￾tributes between –5 to –10 mV to the resting potential.
If there’s a difference between the membrane potential and the Nernst￾equilibrium potential, and if an ion channel is open, then ions flow through that 
channel. To determine how much current will flow and in which direction, the 
driving force is what you need to know.
Finding the driving force on an ion
The driving force on an ion indicates what the combined forces are on an ion. It’s 
the difference between the electrical force of the membrane potential (Vm) and the 
electrochemical force from the concentration gradient (Ex from the Nernst equa￾tion) DF = Vm – Ex.
At rest, the driving force for sodium is –65 mV – 58 mV = –123 mV. At rest, the 
driving force for potassium is –65 mV – (–77 mV) = + 12 mV. At rest, the driving 
force for chloride is –65 mV – (–65 mV) = 0 mV. The sign on the driving force 
indicates, if channels are opened, whether the movement of ions will be into or 
out of the neuron. For a positive ion, a negative driving force indicates flow into 
the neuron and a positive driving force indicates a flow out of the neuron.
Calculating using the Goldman-Hodgkin￾Katz equation
The Nernst equation tells you what the Nernst-equilibrium potential would be for 
a single ion gradient. But multiple ionic concentration differences exist across the 
neuronal membrane. Because ion channels can open, the conductance (permea￾bility) to ions can change. Given the concentration differences of these different 
ions, what is the actual membrane potential if ion permeabilities change?68 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation calculates the membrane potential 
(voltage) that results from all the ionic currents across the membrane through 
various channels. It expands on the Nernst equation by considering multiple ions 
and their individual permeabilities. The GHK equation is as follows: 
V RT
zF ln P K P Na P Cl
P K P Na P Cl m K Na Cl i
K i Na i Cl
0 0
0
P is the relative permeability to each ion and is determined by which ion channels 
are open. The chloride terms are reversed in the numerator and denominator of 
the GHK equation. This is because the valence (z) for chloride is 1, while it’s 1
for sodium and potassium. If you set the permeabilities of two of the ions to zero, 
the GHK equation reduces to the Nernst equation for the remaining ion.
Neurons express both leak and gated ion channels. Open channels determine the 
permeability to the ions they conduct. Gated ion channels are opened by specific 
signals, such as binding of a neurotransmitter, depolarization of the membrane 
potential, or presence of a sensory stimulus. Using the GHK equation you can esti￾mate the membrane potential at rest and during every point in a neuron’s poten￾tial change as channels open and close.
Changing the Membrane Potential
Neurons use changes in the membrane potential, known as electrical signaling, as 
the basis of communication. To change the membrane potential, neurons open (or 
close) gated ion channels. Opening or closing gated channels changes the perme￾ability for specific ions, and therefore, their flow across the membrane, which in 
turn changes the membrane potential.
When the membrane becomes more negative (less positive) than the negative 
resting potential, it’s hyperpolarized. When it’s more positive (less negative) than 
the negative resting potential, it’s depolarized. The term “depolarized” is some￾what of a misnomer because open sodium channels can drive the membrane 
potential toward the sodium Nernst potential (+58 mV), which is technically pos￾itively polarized.
Neurons change their membrane potential in two types of electrical signaling. One 
is synaptic transmission which involves graded potentials that we introduce in the 
following sections. The other type is the action potential that we discuss in the 
section “Generating the Action Potential” later in this chapter.CHAPTER 4 Modulating Membrane Potentials 69
Communicating at synapses
Although neurons differ extensively in their morphologies, most neurons have 
branched processes called dendrites, as well as the cell soma, that receive synaptic 
input from other neurons. The incoming synaptic signaling leads to changes in 
the membrane potential through the opening of gated ion channels at the synapse.
Most neurons also have a single output, the axon that produces and conducts the 
outflowing electrical signal called the action potential. Neurons use the opening of 
gated ion channels to produce and conduct the action potential. Action potentials 
are then used to initiate synaptic transmission at the synapse where the signal is 
transmitted to other neurons or cells.
Synapses are typically contacts between an axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron 
and the dendrite or cell soma of a postsynaptic neuron. The two types of synapses 
are electrical and chemical. In vertebrates with large, complex nervous systems, 
the vast majority of synapses are chemical, whereas a small minority are electri￾cal. Both types of synapses involve ion channels. We discuss electrical and chemi￾cal synapses in Chapter 5 and briefly describe chemical synapses in the following 
sections.
Looking at neurotransmitter 
gated channels
A chemical synapse is formed when the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron 
releases a chemical called a neurotransmitter (NT) that binds to a receptor on the 
postsynaptic membrane, usually on the dendrite or cell soma. NT binding to 
receptors on the postsynaptic membrane can open or close ion channels or have 
other effects. A presynaptic neuron can release an NT that’s either excitatory, 
inhibitory, or modulatory (refer to Chapters 5 and 6).
Synaptic receptors called ionotropic receptors directly open channels that allow the 
flow of ions through the membrane when they bind NTs. Other NT receptors called 
metabotropic receptors have the receptor and channel functions located in separate 
protein complexes in the membrane.
NT receptors that conduct sodium cause depolarization of the membrane poten￾tial, called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). An example is the ionotropic 
glutamate receptor. NT receptors that conduct chloride ions cause a hyperpolar￾ization of the membrane potential and produce an inhibitory postsynaptic poten￾tial (IPSP). An example is the GABAA receptor.70 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Focusing on graded potentials: Passive 
changes in membrane potentials
A neuronal plasma membrane can be modeled electrically as an insulating mem￾brane that separates an inner conductive core from the outer, extracellular fluid, 
which is also conductive. Because of their dimensions, dendrites and axons have 
what are called cable properties. The dendritic and axonal plasma membranes have 
resistance, which is normally very high except where open ion channels and 
transporters are present. The plasma membranes also function as capacitors that 
can be charged and store charge.
Eyeing features of graded potentials
Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs) are graded 
potentials because the magnitude and duration of the response is graded. That is, 
the size of the response depends on the amount of neurotransmitter released, the 
number of receptors, and the distance from the synapse. Typical EPSPs and IPSPs 
are small, about 1 mV or less in size for a duration of about 1 msec.
The other feature of graded potentials is that they’re passive signals, also called 
electrotonic signals. They decrease rapidly from where they’re produced. Current 
conduction along the dendrite or soma membrane and in the cytoplasm involves 
passive current flow.
EPSPs and IPSPs decrease exponentially with increasing distance from the syn￾apse and increasing time after it was produced. Typically, the potential falls to a 
small fraction of its initial value at a distance of a few of millimeters away from 
the synapse and within a few milliseconds of the end of synaptic transmission.
The progressive decrease in the amplitude of the induced potential change along 
a neuronal process such as a dendrite or axon occurs because the current leaks out 
through ion channels and is reduced by axial or dendritic length resistance.
Diminishing synaptic signals
These factors lead to a decrease in the graded potential along a neuronal process, 
whether an axon or dendrite:
» The cytoplasm along the neural process has axial resistance, decreasing the 
voltage from the start of that process toward the end.
» The finite, though large, membrane resistance allows some leakage of current 
across the membrane rather than flowing down it toward the end.
» The membrane has capacitance, the ability to store charge. This is the most 
important factor.CHAPTER 4 Modulating Membrane Potentials 71
Refer to the nearby sidebar for an analogy. Figure 4-2 is a model that represents 
both continuous membrane resistance (due mostly to ion channels) and mem￾brane capacitance.
Integrating responses from synaptic signals
Neurons can receive thousands of synaptic inputs. All the synaptic electrical cur￾rents generated at the dendrites and cell soma integrate (summate) with all the 
other synaptic currents. The net current moves passively along the axial cytoplas￾mic membrane throughout the neuron. Of particular importance is the integration 
of all the incoming EPSPs and IPSPs at the cell soma and initial segment of its axon.
Consider these two types of integration:
» Temporal: The integration of synaptic potentials from repetitive activation of 
one synaptic input. When the action potential frequency is high enough in the 
presynaptic axon, the synaptic responses combine with each other, leading to 
a response that’s larger than the response to a single action potential.
» Spatial: The integration of synaptic potentials from different nearby synaptic 
inputs. Synaptic potentials produced within a short time window from nearby 
synapses combine in the dendrites or soma and produce a larger response 
than the response at a single synapse.

Imagine a neuron at its resting potential of about –65 mV. Another neuron that’s 
presynaptic to this one releases glutamate, which binds the neuron’s excitatory 
glutamate receptors on multiple synapses. This activates the glutamate receptors, 
which open cation channels and sodium flows in.
Say there are 40 synapses on a dendrite that are very close to each other and 
simultaneously active; each produces a 1 mV response. The integrated responses 
depolarizes the dendrite, changing the membrane potential from –65 mV to about 
–35 mV.  This dendritic depolarization spreads throughout the neuronal mem￾brane, but decays as it spreads. Other dendrites have EPSPs and IPSPs that also 
spread toward the cell soma within some time window.
Most neurons have dendritic trees with lengths of less than a few hundred 
micrometers. A major reason why interactions among inputs to a neuron can be so 
complicated is because dendrites have cable properties for transmitting signals. 
The way synaptic signals on different points on a dendrite interact depends on the 
structure of the dendritic tree between the two points. Understanding how synap￾tic inputs are combined within branched dendritic trees is modeled using cable 
theory, which is an important area of research in computation neuroscience. We 
describe this further in Chapter 5.
MEMBRANE CAPACITANCE: LIKE A 
HYDRAULIC SYSTEM
To help you understand the effect of membrane capacitance, consider this analogy to a 
hydraulic system. At one end is a piston in a cylinder, connected through a stiff (but flex￾ible) pipe, to another piston in a cylinder. If you suddenly shove one piston in, then out, 
that pressure pulse is communicated at the speed of sound in fluid to the other piston, 
which moves almost instantly in and out.
Instead consider cutting the stiff but flexible pipe in various places and putting in 
expandable balloons as linkages. Now, when you shove one piston in, some of the fluid 
going through the first section of pipe going directly to the second section goes instead 
into inflating the balloon between them, which takes some time. As this first balloon 
inflates, it starts to send fluid into the pipe going the second balloon, but it inflates even 
more slowly. After several such balloons, the last one barely even starts to inflate before 
the piston moves back.
Capacitance is like the capacity of the balloons in this analogy. The capacitance of typical 
neural processes is such that no effective transient signal can be communicated from 
one end to the other over more than a few hundred micrometers, even if there’s no 
membrane leakage because of the capacitance and high axial conductance.CHAPTER 4 Modulating Membrane Potentials 73
An integrated postsynaptic signal received at the dendrite spreads and decreases 
with time and distance. The combination of low membrane resistance and high 
membrane capacitance means that synaptic input currents in one dendritic loca￾tion may be severely weakened, delayed, and smoothed when they arrive at some 
other location.
In real neurons, even summated synaptic signals are so reduced over distances 
larger than about 200 micrometers that they become ineffective (low amplitude 
and slow time course). This is the limit for passive signal propagation from the 
most distal dendrites to the soma. Neurons need to overcome the problems of 
weakened signals and signal smoothing if they’re to communicate over distances 
larger than a few dendritic trees. For electrical signaling over larger distances, 
neurons evolved active propagation, which we discuss in the next section.
Generating the Action Potential
Neurons evolved a specific boosting mechanism to transmit depolarizations over 
long distances: the action potential. It overcomes the problem of the passive decay 
of graded, electrotonic signals over distance. The action potential is an all-or￾nothing change of the membrane potential (voltage) that serves as the basic unit 
of output electrical signaling in the majority of neurons.
The action potential is a large (change of approximately 80-100 mV) and rapid 
(1 msec) depolarization, followed by a repolarization of the membrane potential 
back to rest that takes about 3 to 5 msec. The key features of the action potential 
are its size and regeneration. For a given neuron, the action potential has a char￾acteristic shape, time course and speed of propagation.
In the next sections we first describe how the action potential is initiated at the 
axon initial segment (in most neurons). Next we describe how the action potential 
is propagated along an unmyelinated axon and a myelinated axon. When it reaches 
the presynaptic terminus the action potential stimulates synaptic transmission, 
which is the topic of Chapter 5.
Reaching threshold for firing
The basis of the action potential is the opening of gated ion channels that include 
voltage-gated sodium and voltage-gated potassium channels. Voltage-gated 
channels rapidly open in response to a depolarization of the membrane potential. 
They’re closed at the resting membrane potential and opened when the mem￾brane potential reaches about –55 mV, called threshold.74 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
A typical neuron has the potential to receive inputs from a thousand or more dif￾ferent neurons and send its outputs to a thousand or more neurons. The synaptic 
inputs spread across the dendrites and soma. Because the amplitude of a single 
synaptic input is typically less than 1 mV, multiple excitatory inputs must be inte￾grated to depolarize a neuron enough to reach threshold at the initial segment for 
generating an action potential.
Integrating postsynaptic potentials
Integration of EPSPs and IPSPs occurs throughout the neuronal membrane all the 
time. However, the place in the neuron where integration is important is at the 
initial segment of the axon hillock because that’s where the action potential is 
generated. It’s the first place along the axon where voltage-gated sodium and 
potassium channels are localized and concentrated.
If integration of all the incoming synaptic EPSPs and IPSPs reaches threshold 
(–55 mV) in the neuron initial segment, the effect is to open voltage-gated sodium 
channels. The sudden opening of many voltage-gated sodium channels produces 
the rising phase of the action potential.
Activating voltage gated Na+ channels
Threshold is determined by the voltage sensitivity of the voltage-gated sodium 
channels and their localization and density at the initial segment of the axon hil￾lock. Threshold can be different for different types of neurons and ranges from 
about –47 mV to –57 mV.
Opening voltage-gated sodium channels increases the conductance for sodium, 
leading to the flow of sodium into the cell. This sodium current further depolar￾izes the initial segment and opens nearby voltage-gated sodium channels.
The situation is one of typical positive feedback in which the neuron is increasingly 
being driven toward, but not quite to the sodium equilibrium potential (approxi￾mately +58 mV).
Inactivating Na+ channel and opening 
voltage gated K+ channels
This amplification causes the neuron to remain stuck in this depolarized condition 
unless something happened to get it back to its resting potential. Two things work 
to do this:
» Sodium channels inactivate and they close themselves.
» Voltage-gated potassium channels open.CHAPTER 4 Modulating Membrane Potentials 75
Following depolarization above threshold, the voltage-gated sodium channels 
transition to the open state. But a rapid mechanism within the channel causes 
them to transition to a closed, inactivated state, even though the membrane voltage 
continues to be above threshold. To transition back to the closed but activatable 
state (resting state), the neuron has to repolarize back to the resting potential. 
Repolarization is aided by voltage gated potassium channel opening. Then the 
cycle can begin again.
Repolarizing with voltage gated K+ channels
Voltage-gated potassium channels are located near voltage-gated sodium chan￾nels. They’re also activated by threshold (–55 mV), but they open more slowly 
than voltage-gated sodium channels. This delayed opening is important because 
it ensures there will be a large initial depolarization. When voltage-gated potas￾sium channels open, potassium flows out of the neuron, which repolarizes the 
membrane potential toward the resting membrane potential and potassium equi￾librium potential, around 75 mV.
The voltage-dependent potassium channels also close after opening, but they 
don’t inactivate. They close because their activity leads to repolarization of the 
membrane potential back to the resting membrane potential. A lingering potas￾sium current produces the afterhyperpolarization or undershoot phase and the 
relative refractory period (see the nearby sidebar). See how these events play out 
in Figure 4-3.
The trace in Figure 4-3 labeled “V” is the membrane potential, and the scale for 
this trace is on the left. At the start of the plot, the membrane potential is at the 
resting level, about –65 mV. As voltage-gated sodium channels open, the mem￾brane potential becomes depolarized to +30 or +40 mV, close to the sodium equi￾librium potential. The membrane potential then repolarizes to a level below the 
resting potential, and then finally returns to the resting potential.
The other two traces in Figure 4-3 show the sodium and potassium permeabilities 
that control the membrane potential. The action potential is triggered by any 
input that depolarizes the initial segment enough to reach threshold and open the 
voltage-gated sodium channels. The permeability (conductance) of the voltage￾gated sodium channels is given by the gNa trace. The conductance is nearly zero at 
the resting potential, rises to a maximum peak, and then returns to zero through 
the transition from the open to the closed, inactivated state.
The opening and closing of the voltage-gated potassium channels, whose con￾ductance is gK, happens more slowly than the voltage-gated sodium channels. 
They tend to drive the membrane potential toward the potassium-equilibrium 
potential, around 75 mV. The repolarizing phase of the action potential involves 
both the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels and opening of voltage￾gated potassium channels.76 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Moving to the refractory periods
The period immediately following an action potential when it’s impossible or 
more difficult to elicit a second action potential is called the refractory period. It has 
two phases:
» Absolute refractory period: This is the time when the voltage-gated sodium 
channels are inactivated. In this state no additional action potential can be 
elicited, no matter how strong the depolarizing input at the initial segment 
because the sodium channels won’t reopen. The absolute refractory period 
sets the theoretical maximum frequency of action potential generation at 
about 1,000 per second or 1,000 Hz. The absolute refractory period also 
ensures that the action potential travels in one direction toward the 
presynaptic terminus and not back along the axon to the cell body.
» Relative refractory period: The relative refractory period is when the 
voltage-gated sodium channels have transitioned from inactivated back to 
closed, activatable, but the voltage-gated potassium channels are still open. 
Voltage-gated potassium channels determine the time course of the falling 
phase and the relative refractory period. Because of the persistent potassium 
current, during this period a greater depolarizing current at the initial segment 
is required to reach threshold to generate an action potential.
FIGURE 4-3:

underlying the 
action potential.

The sodium-potassium pump runs all the time, causing the imbalance in ionic 
concentrations between the inside and outside of the neuron. A single action 
potential creates a temporary current through the membrane, which changes the 
membrane potential, but it has little effect on the total ion concentrations within 
the entire neuron. Even if all the sodium-potassium pumps shut down, up to mil￾lions of action potentials can occur before the cell starts to lose its concentration 
difference with respect to the cell exterior.
REFRACTORY PERIODS AND SPIKE 
RATE CODING
Neurobiologists generally model synaptic inputs to neurons as currents injected into 
the dendritic tree (refer to Chapter 3) that are transformed into a train of spikes at the 
cell soma or axon initial segment. If the firing rate were exactly proportional to total syn￾aptic current (above threshold), the relationship between synaptic current and spike 
rate would be called linear. However, in reality, this relationship isn’t linear for two main 
reasons:
• Leakage currents through the membrane tend to shunt away synaptic current 
more for low, slowly changing current levels than for rapidly changing ones.
• At high spike rates, the refractory period requires disproportionally more synaptic 
current to increase the spike rate. In fact, as the absolute refractory period is 
approached, no amount of increased synaptic input current can increase the 
spike rate.
One interesting result of this second factor is that the relationship between synaptic 
input current and spike rate in most neurons is more like a logarithmic function than a 
linear function. Psychophysical laws such as Weber’s and Fechner’s laws have long dem￾onstrated that the perception of magnitude in senses such as sight, sound, and touch 
also follow a logarithmic relationship, where doubling the stimulus magnitude produces 
less than a doubling of the sensory perceptual magnitude. Direct experimental compari￾sons between perception of magnitude and neural firing rates have shown that the 
logarithmic spike compression underlies the logarithmic perception — that is, the per￾ceptual magnitude follows the neural firing rate, which itself is logarithmically related 
to the magnitude of the stimulus.78 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Encoding information: The neural code
After the membrane potential reaches the resting membrane potential, a subse￾quent action potential can be generated if the membrane potential (at the initial 
segment) is depolarized above threshold. An action potential doesn’t typically 
occur only once but occurs in what are called action potential trains, sets, or series. 
The frequency and duration of the action potentials in the train depends on the 
magnitude and duration of the summed graded potentials (inputs from synapses) 
in the neuron. The net magnitude of excitatory currents in the neuron is thus 
converted into a rate and pattern of action potential firing.
Conducting Action Potentials
Action potentials are conducted along the axon toward the axon terminal, presyn￾aptic to the next neuron. About half of all neurons in the central nervous system 
(CNS) are unmyelinated and about half are myelinated. The majority of axons in 
the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are myelinated.
In unmyelinated axons, voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels are 
located at every region along the axon and mediate continuous conduction. Depo￾larization activates voltage-gated sodium channels in the adjacent membrane 
region, and sodium flows through the channel. This is the transmembrane current.
Once inside, the sodium moves along the membrane and diffuses in the axoplasm. 
This is the axial current. While the axial sodium current decays rapidly, the density 
of the voltage gated sodium channels ensures that an action potential is initiated 
in the next region of the membrane.
In continuous conduction, the transmembrane sodium current is followed by a 
small axial sodium current. Voltage-gated potassium channels are also located all 
along the axonal membrane where they repolarize the action potential at every 
membrane along the axon. Thus, the action potential is generated and propagates 
down the entire length of the unmyelinated axon membrane. It is regenerated 
continuously along an unmyelinated axon, where the speed of action potential 
conduction is between 1 to 10 mm per msec.
Speeding action potentials
Two mechanisms can increase the rate of AP conduction: increasing the diameter 
of an axon and myelination. The types of neurons that need increased speed of 
action potential conduction are neurons with long axons. These include somatic 
and autonomic lower motor neurons and sensory neurons in the PNS. Schwann 
cells myelinate them (refer to Chapter 1).CHAPTER 4 Modulating Membrane Potentials 79
In the CNS, projection/principal neurons are myelinated. They extend their axon 
outside of one CNS region and make synapses with target neurons in another 
region of the CNS. Oligodendrocytes myelinate them.
Conducting along myelinated axons
Myelinated axons have segments that are myelinated and that are interrupted by 
small unmyelinated gaps called Nodes of Ranvier (hereafter referred to as Nodes). 
Voltage-gated ion channels and transporters are localized at the Nodes. They’re 
also the regions where sodium and potassium ions cross the membrane to estab￾lish the resting membrane potential and regenerate the action potential. In 
myelinated axons, action potentials are conducted using saltatory conduction.
In saltatory conduction, the action potential is regenerated only at the Nodes 
because those are the only regions of the axon where voltage-gated channels are 
located. They’re also the only places where channels have access to the extracel￾lular fluid. Depolarization at the Nodes leads to activation of voltage gated sodium 
channels, allowing sodium ions to flow across the axonal membrane and into the 
axoplasm, producing the transmembrane sodium current.
There are no channels or pumps in the myelinated segments. Myelination greatly 
increases membrane resistance outside the Nodes. It reduces membrane capaci￾tance and decreases the time smearing of the signal. This enhances the axial 
current.
Between the Nodes in the myelinated segments, the axial current flows passively 
and reaches the next Node where it depolarizes the membrane potential above 
threshold and activates voltage gated channels in the Node. Voltage-gated potas￾sium channels are also located only at the Nodes, so repolarization of the action 
potential occurs at the Nodes as well. Therefore, the action potential is regener￾ated only at the Nodes. The axial current moves more rapidly than the time it 
takes to produce the transmembrane current, thus saltatory conduction is faster 
than continuous conduction.
The Nodes are spaced at the distance they’re so that they’re far enough for the 
next jump to produce the next spike, but close enough so the membrane potential 
doesn’t decay below threshold before it reaches the adjacent Node. Saltatory con￾duction travels at about ten times faster speed than in unmyelinated axons, 
between 20 and 100 mm/msec.CHAPTER 5 Transmitting to Targets 81
Chapter 5
Transmitting to Targets
Neurons have many functions. They detect sensory signals in the external 
and internal environments and transmit that information to the brain. 
They receive incoming information from other neurons, integrate it, store 
it, and send commands out to muscles to control movements, behaviors, and 
responses. In this chapter we introduce chemical synaptic transmission and neu￾rotransmitters. We describe the general mechanisms of how neurons accomplish 
the transmission of information from a neuron to its target.
Looking at Synaptic Transmission
Synaptic transmission is a specialized type of cell-to-cell communication that 
occurs at synapses. Synapses are small contact areas between a neuron and its 
target that mediate this communication. At a typical synapse, the information 
sending region is the axon. On the receiving side, the target can be another neuron, 
a muscle cell, or a gland.

neurotransmitters

channels

and circuits82 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
The two major types of synapses are called 
» Chemical synapses: Chemical synapses involve neurotransmitters and 
receptors and represent the great majority of synapses in the vertebrate 
nervous system.
» Electrical synapses: Electrical synapses involve the direct flow of current from 
the presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic cell. Electrical synapses are common 
in invertebrates but make up only a small fraction of synapses in vertebrates.
In both types, an electrical change in the presynaptic neuron produces a response 
in the postsynaptic target. However, each uses different mechanisms for commu￾nicating with its target. Here we focus on chemical synaptic transmission. We 
discuss electrical synapses in the section “Closing in on Electrical Synapses” later 
in this chapter.
Examining chemical synapses
At chemical synapses, neurotransmitters in the presynaptic axon region are pack￾aged into small vesicles. Neurotransmitters are small organic chemicals that include 
several amino acids, other amine containing molecules, and small peptides. The 
vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, which releases the neurotransmitter 
into the gap, called the synaptic cleft. This small space is between the presynaptic 
axon and its target.
The released neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to 
receptors in the postsynaptic membrane and produce a response. The two types of 
neurotransmitter receptors are
» Ionotropic receptors: They open ion channels directly.
» Metabotropic receptors: They open or close ion channels indirectly and also 
produce non-electrical responses.
Because several biochemical steps are involved in chemical synapses, there is a 
short delay of between 0.5 and a few milliseconds between the presynaptic and 
postsynaptic response. Despite this delay, chemical synaptic transmission is fast 
enough that it mediates the great majority of all synaptic transmission in the 
vertebrate nervous system.
Getting to know neurotransmitters
Chemical synaptic transmission involves the following:CHAPTER 5 Transmitting to Targets 83
» Conventional neurotransmitters: They’re packaged into vesicles, released 
in response to a presynaptic action potential or depolarization, and activate 
postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors.
» Unconventional neurotransmitters: They aren’t packaged into vesicles 
but are synthesized at the synapse. They’re hydrophobic molecules that can 
diffuse across the membrane and bind to targets. Refer to the section 
“Looking at unconventional transmitters” later in this chapter for more.
Conventional neurotransmitters include small molecules and neuropeptides. Here 
are the four categories of small molecule neurotransmitters: 
» Amino acids: They include glutamate, aspartate, GABA, and glycine.
» Acetylcholine: It’s in its own category.
» Monoamines: They include dopamine, epinephrine (aka adrenaline), 
norepinephrine (aka noradrenaline), serotonin (aka 5-HT), and histamine.
» Purines: They include adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine.
Several additional small molecule neurotransmitters, including octopamine and 
tyramine, are used in invertebrates.
The neuropeptides include more than 50 different types, for example somatostatin, 
substance P, neuropeptide Y, β-endorphin, and oxytocin. Refer to “Identifying 
neuropeptides neurotransmitters” in a subsequent section for more information.
For the rest of this chapter when we use the term neurotransmitters, we refer to 
conventional neurotransmitters.
Synthesizing with small molecule 
neurotransmitters
Small molecule neurotransmitters are synthesized in the presynaptic region by 
enzymes in the cytoplasm or mitochondria. After synthesis they’re transported 
into synaptic vesicles by vesicular neurotransmitter transporters (refer to 
Chapters 4 and 6). Synaptic vesicles are produced by the early endosome (refer 
to Chapter 2).
There are different pools of synaptic vesicles. Some vesicles are docked at a 
region  called the active zone. Synaptic vesicles are located near voltage-gated 
calcium channels. In response to the action potential, these channels open and 
allow calcium to flow into the presynaptic region. This calcium activates the 
fusion of the vesicles and release of neurotransmitter.84 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Identifying neuropeptide 
neurotransmitters
Neuropeptides are small proteins, between 3 to 36 amino acids in length. They’re 
synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cell soma and traffic to the 
Golgi where they’re packaged into secretory vesicles or dense core vesicles. These 
vesicles are transported along the axon by fast axonal transport to the presynaptic 
region. At the presynaptic region, neuropeptide containing vesicles are localized 
farther away from the active zone than are synaptic vesicles that contain small 
molecule neurotransmitters.
Combining neurotransmitters
The majority of neurons express only one type of small molecule neurotrans￾mitter and may also release one neuropeptide, called co-release. Studies have 
identified several types of neurons that express two types of small molecule 
neurotransmitters: GABA and glycine are both released by inhibitory interneu￾rons in the spinal cord. Starburst amacrine cells in the retina release acetyl￾choline and GABA at different regions.
Looking at unconventional transmitters
Unconventional neurotransmitters aren’t packaged into vesicles or released in 
response to an action potential. Instead, they’re typically produced in response to 
the action of a conventional neurotransmitter. The two categories, which are both 
small hydrophobic molecules, are as follows:
» Gasotransmitters: They include nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and 
hydrogen sulfide.
» Lipid transmitters: The lipid transmitters include endocannabinoids which 
act at the cannabinoid receptor.
We discuss the action of unconventional transmitters in more detail in Chapter 6.
Expanding Views of Chemical Synapses
In the classical view, a synapse is located where a presynaptic axon ends at its 
target, the postsynaptic dendrite or soma, for example. The presynaptic region is 
often called the presynaptic terminus. But real synapses are much more complicated 
than the classical view in five important ways:CHAPTER 5 Transmitting to Targets 85
» Not all axons end at the synapse. Many axons form a synapse and then 
continue on to form synapses with other parts of the same neuron or other 
neurons. These synapses are called en passant synapses, from the French for 
“in passing” (and a chess move). Estimates are that the majority of excitatory 
synapses in the human brain are en passant, formed by enlarged regions of 
the axon, called presynaptic boutons, where the synapses form. Many en 
passant synapse form on dendritic spines. Hereafter we refer to the 
presynaptic region instead of the presynaptic terminus.
» Many synapses contain more than just a presynaptic axon and 
postsynaptic target. Many synapses involve nearby astrocytes and extra￾cellular matrix proteins. They can provide encapsulation of the synapse that 
prevents neurotransmitter from diffusing quickly away. Astrocytes also 
express neurotransmitter transporters that help regulate how much neuro￾transmitter is present in the synapse and for how long.
» Synaptic transmission has two types:
• Wiring (point-to-point) transmission: Only the receptors that are located 
at the postsynaptic membrane are activated. That’s especially true if the 
synapse is enclosed.
• Volume transmission: It can occur if a synapse isn’t enclosed, where 
neurotransmitter can spill out in the extracellular space to activate nearby 
regions. Volume transmission can also occur when neurotransmitters are 
released outside the synapse into the extracellular fluid and can affect 
nearby neurons.
» The synaptic cleft is small and contains proteins. The classical view shows 
the synaptic cleft as a large empty space between the presynaptic axon and 
postsynaptic target. Actually, it’s quite narrow, only 40 to 50 micrometers. 
That’s about the diameter or one synaptic vesicle. In addition, at most 
synapses the pre- and postsynaptic regions are physically connected to each 
other by the binding of cell adhesion molecules across the cleft. Extracellular 
proteins are also located in the cleft that can tether or affect the diffusion of 
some secreted molecules.
» Synapses differ substantially depending on their location and function.
Many synapses between neurons are small with a single active zone and 
produce small responses. Neurons integrate responses from many synaptic 
inputs.
In contrast, a synapse between a motor neuron and its target skeletal muscle 
at the neuromuscular junction is large, with multiple active zones, where 
transmission produces a large response. A muscle cell receives input from 
only a single presynaptic axon that produces a response large enough to 
activate a muscle action potential and contraction in the muscle fiber.86 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Focusing on Chemical Synaptic 
Transmission Mechanisms
Neurotransmitters are packaged into vesicles and released when an action poten￾tial arrives at the presynaptic region. In the next sections we describe how and 
where neurotransmitters are packaged into vesicles and discuss the molecular 
mechanisms underlying release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
Packaging neurotransmitters
Small molecule neurotransmitters are packaged into synaptic vesicles by vesicu￾lar neurotransmitters transporters (refer to Chapters  4 and  6). Some synaptic 
vesicles become docked near the active zone. In contrast, neuropeptides are 
packaged into secretory or dense core vesicles in the Golgi and travel along 
the axon to the presynaptic region. These vesicles are localized farther away from 
the active zone.
Keeping calcium levels low at rest
The movement of sodium and potassium ions through voltage-gated ion channels 
underlies the action potential, which depolarizes the presynaptic region (refer to 
Chapter 4). At the presynaptic region, it’s the job of calcium ions to activate syn￾aptic transmission. At rest, the presynaptic intracellular calcium levels are kept 
low by the actions of primary and secondary active calcium transporters (refer to 
Chapter 4). These transporters are located on the plasma membrane, in the endo￾plasmic reticulum and mitochondria.
Checking out neurotransmitter release
In chemical synapses, the presynaptic axon releases neurotransmitters in a region 
called a terminal if the axon ends at the synapse. In many axons, the axon doesn’t 
end where it forms a synapse as in an en passant synapses where neurotransmit￾ter is released by the presynaptic bouton.
Neurotransmitters are released when synaptic or secretory vesicles fuse with the 
plasma membrane. The released neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic 
cleft, where they bind to the postsynaptic receptors. The arrival of an action 
potential (refer to Chapter 4) at the axon terminal is what triggers this process.CHAPTER 5 Transmitting to Targets 87
Releasing Neurotransmitter from 
the Presynaptic Region
When an action potential arrives, it causes small molecule neurotransmitters to be 
released into the synaptic cleft. Synaptic vesicle fusion and release of neurotrans￾mitter is extremely fast because voltage-gated calcium channels are localized 
next to the docked synaptic vesicles at the active zones. Figure  5-1 shows the 
mechanism for neurotransmitter release.
Progressing through the sequence
This sequence of events for vesicular release of neurotransmitter takes only a few 
tenths of a millisecond:
1. An action potential is conducted down the axon, reaches the presynaptic 
region, and depolarizes the presynaptic membrane.
2. The depolarization causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open, and calcium 
ions flow in and rapidly increase the presynaptic calcium concentration.
3. The elevated calcium binds to and activates the calcium sensor protein called 
synaptotagmin located on the docked synaptic or secretory vesicles.

4. Synaptotagmin activates and becomes part of the SNARE complex that 
includes the proteins synaptobrevin, syntaxin and SNAP-25. The activated 
SNARE complex form a physical link that attaches the vesicle to the presynaptic 
membrane.
5. The vesicle fuses with the presynaptic membrane, releasing neurotransmitters 
into the synaptic cleft or extracellular fluid. This is called exocytosis.
6. Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, which 
leads to fast and/or slow responses, depending on the types of receptors.
7. Neurotransmitters diffuse out of the cleft or, in most cases, is removed from 
the cleft by degradation or reuptake.
8. Endocytosis takes in the fused vesicle membrane, and the synaptic vesicles are 
recycled or new vesicles are generated.
9. Calcium is returned to resting levels by calcium transporters.
Noting differences in transmission
Synaptic vesicles and secretory vesicles use the same mechanism for release. 
However, secretory vesicles are located farther away from the active zone and are 
released more slowly. They often require multiple action potentials to increase the 
calcium enough for their release. Because of their location, secretory vesicles may 
also release neuropeptides into the extracellular fluid around the synapse. In this 
case they can function in volume transmission.
Sensory neurons in the visual, auditory, vestibular, and taste sensory systems are 
neurons that don’t have axons and don’t produce action potentials. But sensory 
detection and transduction in these neurons produce modulations in the mem￾brane potential that lead to changes in neurotransmitter release at synapses onto 
target neurons. The downstream and relay neurons then transmit the sensory 
information to the thalamus.
In many chemical synapses, plasma membrane transporters in the postsynaptic 
membrane remove neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft. However, some 
transporters can work in reverse, releasing neurotransmitters into the synapse in 
a process called nonvesicular release. In this scenario, release doesn’t depend on a 
presynaptic action potential or calcium. Neurotransmitter is pumped directly into 
the cleft and where it can activate receptors.
Eleven different small molecules and approximately 50 neuropeptides function as 
neurotransmitters in vertebrate neurotransmission. Several hundred distinct 
receptor types exist for these neurotransmitters.CHAPTER 5 Transmitting to Targets 89
Being Receptive to Receptors
Receptors are protein complexes that bind to a chemical (called a ligand) and pro￾duce a response. A ligand can be an endogenous chemical made by a presynaptic 
cell, like a neurotransmitter, or it can be a plant-derived chemical like caffeine, or 
a synthetic drug made in the laboratory. We discuss receptors in greater detail in 
the following sections.
Grasping some key characteristics
Receptors are located mainly on the plasma membrane because their ligands are 
hydrophilic and can’t cross the membrane and diffuse inside the cell. However, a 
few receptors are found inside in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Their ligands are 
hydrophobic, like estrogens, androgens, and cortisol and thyroid hormones, 
which can diffuse directly inside the cell and bind to their receptors.
Here are a few other important characteristics of receptors:
» Ligands bind reversibly to their receptors. The ligand binds (associates) 
and then unbinds (dissociates). When the ligand binds, the binding can induce 
a conformational change in the receptor to activate it. An activated receptor 
produces a change in the cell called a response. After the ligand concentration 
decreases, the receptor returns to its resting state and the response stops. 
Receptors are then reactivated if the ligand levels increase again in the future.
» Ligands are specific for their receptors. Even closely related chemicals 
won’t bind well to a receptor. This way a receptor is activated only by its 
specific ligand. This specificity and the matching of neurotransmitter synthesis 
with receptor expression are essential components of communication in the 
nervous system.
» Receptors require a certain concentration of the ligand to be activated.
This concentration is the affinity of the receptor. Receptor affinities are 
matched to the concentration of ligand present in the extracellular environ￾ment. Hormone receptors have very high affinity because the concentration 
of hormones typically present in the blood is very low. In contrast, neurotrans￾mitter receptors have a moderate affinity because the concentration of 
neurotransmitter at the synapse is higher.
An agonist is a chemical not normally present in the body (exogenous), but when 
introduced is effective in producing the same effects as the normal neurotrans￾mitter. An antagonist binds to a receptor but doesn’t produce an effect. It can 
prevent the normal ligand from binding and inhibit a response.90 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Activating neurotransmitter receptors
Referring to neurotransmitters is common (including in this book) as excitatory 
or inhibitory. This distinction is based on the type of electrical response the 
neurotransmitter typically produces. Glutamate and aspartate typically act as 
excitatory neurotransmitters while GABA and glycine typically act as inhibitory 
neurotransmitters. However, the effect of a neurotransmitter on the postsynap￾tic cell depends on the type of receptor it activates.
An important distinction between neurotransmitter receptors is the speed and 
type of response they produce:
» Ionotropic: Fast direct transmission involves ionotropic receptors. Ionotropic 
receptors are ligand-gated ion channels. Opening ion channels directly affects 
the membrane potential and produce an electrical response.
» Metabotropic: Slow indirect transmission involves metabotropic receptors. 
Metabotropic receptors are G protein–coupled receptors that can also affect ion 
channels and the membrane potential but can also produce other responses.
Directing fast transmission
Most rapid actions in the nervous system are mediated by small molecule neu￾rotransmitters that act on ionotropic receptors. Only six neurotransmitters in the 
mammalian nervous system have ionotropic receptors: 
» Glutamate, aspartate, acetylcholine, and serotonin produce fast excitatory 
transmission.
» GABA and glycine produce fast inhibitory transmission.
These fast responses are mediated by ionotropic receptors.
An ionotropic receptor has a binding region that faces the outside and an ion 
channel region within the membrane. When neurotransmitter is absent, the ion 
channel is closed. When neurotransmitter levels increase and bind, the receptor’s 
transmembrane regions move in such a way that opens the channel pore, allowing 
specific ions to pass through it.
Exciting the postsynaptic target
Ionotropic receptors for glutamate, aspartate, acetylcholine, and serotonin are 
permeable to sodium and potassium ions. At the resting membrane potential, the CHAPTER 5 Transmitting to Targets 91
driving force for sodium is much greater than the driving force for potassium. 
Thus the majority of current through these ionotropic receptors will be a sodium 
current that causes depolarization of the membrane potential and is excitatory.
One type of ionotropic glutamate receptor called the NMDA receptor, and one type 
of acetylcholine receptor, the alpha 7 receptor, are also permeable to calcium ions. 
Activation allows sodium and calcium levels to increase in the postsynaptic 
neuron. Sodium influx depolarizes the membrane potential while calcium works 
as a second messenger to regulate a number of processes.
Although glutamate and acetylcholine are generally associated with fast 
excitatory synaptic transmission through ionotropic receptors, both also activate 
metabotropic receptors. And serotonin has both ionotropic and metabotropic 
receptors as well.
Inhibiting for control
The ionotropic receptors for GABA and glycine are ligand-gated chloride channels. 
The chloride equilibrium potential for most neurons is just below the resting 
potential. GABA or glycine opening of their ionotropic receptors typically leads to 
chloride influx, which hyperpolarizes the membrane potential and is inhibitory. In 
neurons, opening chloride channels also counteracts the depolarization caused by 
opening excitatory ionotropic receptors by reducing membrane resistance. This 
effect is called shunting inhibition.
In the same way that glutamate, acetylcholine, and serotonin all have both iono￾tropic and metabotropic receptors, GABA also activates a metabotropic receptor. 
Metabotropic GABA receptors lead to opening of potassium channels via a 
G protein in a process that also causes inhibition.
The most abundant excitatory ionotropic receptors in the mammalian nervous 
system are those for glutamate and acetylcholine. Glutamate receptors are by far 
the most numerous and important excitatory receptors in the CNS. In the periph￾eral nervous system excitatory synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junc￾tion uses acetylcholine. In addition, metabotropic receptors for glutamate and 
acetylcholine mediate other responses.
The most important inhibitory neurotransmitters in the CNS are GABA and 
glycine receptors. Inhibitory ionotropic receptors are permeable to and conduct 
chloride. For GABA, metabotropic receptors also exist. Interestingly, there are 
few inhibitory neurotransmitters used in the peripheral nervous system.92 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Meeting Metabotropic Receptors
Metabotropic receptors are the targets of all the monoamines and all the neuro￾peptides. Glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine also have metabotropic receptors. 
These sections describe how activation of metabotropic receptors produces slow 
indirect synaptic transmission, often with longer lasting responses.
Working through G proteins
In contrast to ionotropic receptors, metabotropic receptors have no ion channel. 
Instead, when they bind to a neurotransmitter, a conformational change in the 
receptor activates a G protein inside the postsynaptic neuron. G proteins bind 
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) or guanosine diphosphate (GDP). Metabotropic 
receptors activate heterotrimeric G proteins formed by three subunits, called 
alpha, beta, and gamma. An activated metabotropic receptor stimulates the bind￾ing of GTP to the alpha subunit. Alpha-GTP dissociates from the beta/gamma 
subunits. The alpha subunit eventually hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP and then 
alpha reassociates with beta/gamma.
Both the alpha and beta/gamma subunits can stimulate targets called effector
proteins in the plasma membrane. The effector is either an ion channel or an 
enzyme that produces a second messenger. The second messenger may also 
regulate an ion channel. Second messengers also activate protein kinase and 
phosphatases and other actions. Downstream of second messengers there can be 
effects on metabolism, the cytoskeleton, and/or gene expression. These effects 
are called neuromodulation.
Numerous neurotransmitters function through activation of metabotropic recep￾tors and produce neuromodulatory responses. Second messenger cascades can 
cause multiple actions. They may stimulate the opening or closing of ion chan￾nels. Second messengers can lead to the modulation of neuronal morphology, 
metabolism, and/or gene expression. These effects tend to be slower and longer 
lasting compared to the rapid effects of ionotropic receptors.
Metabotropic receptors activate G proteins, so these receptors are also referred to 
as G protein-coupled receptors. Besides neurons, the majority of cells in the body 
express receptors in this category. About a thousand different G protein-coupled 
receptors have been identified in the human genome. Many of them are odorant 
receptors expressed in olfactory receptor cells.CHAPTER 5 Transmitting to Targets 93
Activating second messengers
More than a thousand types of metabotropic receptors exist, but they use only a 
limited number of second messenger pathways:
» Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway: Some metabotropic 
receptors activate an increase in cAMP. Other receptors lead to a decrease 
in cAMP.
» Phospholipase C pathway: Inositol triphosphate/diacylglycerol (IP3/DAG) 
pathway.
» PI 3-kinase and ERK MAPK pathways: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase and 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase 
pathways.
SIGNALING IN PATHWAYS
One group of metabotropic receptors activate a G protein called Gs to stimulate 
adenylyl cyclase, its effector. This, in turn, converts ATP in the cytoplasm into the second 
messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), which diffuses within the cytoplasm. cAMP can bind to 
and open specific ion channels from the inside. cAMP also activates protein kinase A 
(PKA). Protein kinases add phosphate groups (phosphorylation) to regulate ion channels, 
cytoskeletal proteins, receptors, and transcription and translation factors.
Another group of metabotropic receptors activate the G protein Gq, which stimulates 
the effector phospholipase C (PLC). PLC produces two second messengers called 
diacylgycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). DAG activates a protein kinase 
called protein kinase C (PKC). IP3 binds to and opens calcium channels on the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This allows calcium ions to flow out of the ER and 
increases the cytoplasmic calcium levels.
Calcium ions bind to an adaptor protein called calmodulin. Calcium/calmodulin has 
numerous targets, one of which is the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 
CaMKII. Similar to PKA and PKC, CaMKII is a protein kinase that has hundreds of 
substrates in neurons, including metabolic enzymes, channels, receptors, transporters, 
cytoskeletal proteins, and transcription and translation factors.
There are two other ways that neurons can increase their intracellular calcium:
• By activation of voltage gated calcium channels that are also expressed in dendrites
• Through NMDA receptor activation (NMDA receptors are permeable to both 
sodium and calcium)94 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Co-expressing receptor types
At some synapses, both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors can be co-expressed. 
In dendritic spines for example, ionotropic receptors are often localized across 
from the presynaptic active zone while metabotropic receptors are located outside 
the synapse in perisynaptic areas. In response to neurotransmitter release, both 
fast, direct, and slow, indirect transmission can occur at the same synaptic region. 
Both types of receptors may also be located at the presynaptic membrane and 
serve as autoreceptors to provide feedback control of neurotransmitter release.
In some cases, neurotransmitters activate both ionotropic and metabotropic 
receptors at the same synaptic region. In other cases, neurotransmitters activate 
ionotropic receptors in some neural circuits and metabotropic receptors in others.
Getting Back to Rest
After neurotransmitter release, neurotransmitter molecules must be removed so 
the neuron can return to its resting state and cycles of synaptic transmission can 
continue. In addition, the fused synaptic vesicle membrane must be retrieved so 
presynaptic membrane area can be controlled. The next sections describe these 
processes in more detail.
Ending neurotransmitter responses
Three main mechanisms remove the neurotransmitter molecules:
» Diffusion: The neurotransmitter may diffuse away from the synaptic cleft. 
In some cases, the neurotransmitter may then activate receptors outside the 
synapse in volume transmission.
» Degradation: Enzymes within the synaptic cleft degrade the neurotransmitter. 
An example is the degradation of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase.
» Reuptake: Plasma membrane transporters take up the neurotransmitter. 
The transported neurotransmitter can be repackaged and released again. This is 
how glutamate, GABA, glycine, and the monoamines are removed. Transporters 
can be located in the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons and nearby astro￾cytes. In a few neurons, these transporters may work in the opposite direction 
to release neurotransmitters.CHAPTER 5 Transmitting to Targets 95
Recycling membranes by endocytosis
In some cases, a synaptic vesicle only partially fuses with the presynaptic mem￾brane, called kiss and run, before the vesicle membrane is quickly taken back in by 
endocytosis. In this case the synaptic vesicle remains intact and can be refilled 
with neurotransmitter.
Other synaptic vesicles undergo full fusion with the presynaptic membrane. When 
this occurs, the transmembrane proteins and lipids from both membranes mix 
before endocytosis. The endocytic vesicles traffic to the early endosome where 
they’re sorted, and new synaptic vesicles bud off. The endocytosis and recycling of 
synaptic vesicles is an important process for synaptic transmission.
Closing in on Electrical Synapses
In addition to chemical synapses, the other rarer type of synapse is an electrical 
synapse that doesn’t involve neurotransmitters or receptors. In an electrical syn￾apse, protein channel subunits on the presynaptic axon form a complex with the 
same channel subunits expressed on the postsynaptic cell in a process called a gap 
junction. Gap junctions occur between some neurons and also between many types 
of cells, including astrocytes, liver cells, and secretory cells. These sections look at 
the characteristics of gap junctions and electrical synapses.
Flowing through gap junctions
The gap junction is a connexon channel, which has a pore that links the cytoplasm 
of the presynaptic axon to the cytoplasm of the postsynaptic cell. The pore in the 
gap junction is larger and less selective than a typical ion channel. It’s permeable 
to ions, including sodium, potassium, and chloride ions and small organic mole￾cules less than a kilodalton.
Electrical (ionic) currents pass through the connecting gap junctions from one cell 
to the other. These currents make the postsynaptic cell respond in a manner sim￾ilar to the presynaptic cell. The advantages of this type of synapse are speed and 
synchronicity because the postsynaptic cell follows the presynaptic cell in lock￾step. Figure 5-2 shows a gap junction at high magnification.96 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Comparing chemical and electrical
Although transmission at electrical synapses is faster, chemical synapses are 
more adaptable. By activating numerous receptors, a response at a chemical 
synapse can be enhanced. By activating different types of the receptors, the post￾synaptic response at a chemical synapse can be depolarizing and excitatory or 
hyperpolarizing and inhibitory. By activating receptors that produce second mes￾sengers at a chemical synapse, responses can be widespread and longer lasting. 
In  addition, each step in chemical transmission represents a place that can be 
modified and regulated by gene expression.
Integrating Postsynaptic Responses
Most neurons in the CNS can receive thousands of synaptic inputs. The 
responses produced by ionotropic and metabotropic receptors will be integrated. 
Integration is essential to control the output signal, the action potentials from 
the neuron. Here we discuss how synaptic responses are integrated in the 
postsynaptic neuron.
FIGURE 5-2:

synapses.

Summating the potentials
Both temporal and spatial summation occur continuously throughout the neuron 
to integrate the incoming electrical responses. When the integrated membrane 
potential reaches threshold at the initial segment of the axon, the action potential 
will be generated and then conducted along the axon. The action potential output 
frequency and pattern is dependent on continuous spatial and temporal summa￾tion of all the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.
Changing synapses in plasticity
One of the most intriguing recent advances in neurobiology is the understanding 
that synaptic transmission isn’t fixed, but changes in synapses occur in response 
to pre- and postsynaptic firing patterns. This is called synaptic plasticity, a type of 
neuroplasticity that occurs in both the developing and adult nervous systems. 
Synaptic plasticity is well accepted as one of the mechanisms involved in learning 
and memory and as a potential mechanism in recovery following injury.
Synaptic plasticity occurs during development in sensory, motor, and cognitive 
systems. Synaptic plasticity also occurs at synapses in the adult brain. Several 
types of synaptic plasticity have been characterized, including short-term plas￾ticity, lasting a few seconds to minutes, and long-term plasticity, lasting minutes 
to hours and longer. Both increases and decreases in synaptic efficacy can occur. 
Synaptic plasticity depends on activity and the timing of inputs, as well as the 
prior history of activity at the synapse and activity of nearby synapses. Each has 
computational functions.
This chapter highlights presynaptic and postsynaptic activities involved in 
synaptic transmission. Several of these mechanisms can be modulated in synaptic 
plasticity. Chapter 15 describes proposed mechanisms and functions of synaptic 
plasticity.
Dividing and Conquering: Circuits
Understanding the function of a neural circuit or brain area can be difficult for 
neurobiologists because for most neurons in the middle of the brain we don’t 
know exactly what the input is, where the output goes, or what the output does. 
Several schemes have been proposed for analyzing the functions of neurons in 
large circuits.98 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Analyzing the functions
One instructive way to analyze the function question was proposed by David Marr 
and Tomaso Poggio of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. They suggested 
that function in the nervous system could be approached at three levels:
» Computational level: What is the overall task of the system? For example, 
the autopilot in an airplane has the task of keeping the plane on the correct 
heading at the right altitude, among other things.
» Algorithmic/representational level: How does the system operate? For the 
autopilot, algorithms compute how much elevator change in degrees should 
be made for a particular altitude error.
» Physical implementation level: What’s the actual hardware? Autopilots can be 
digital or analog, controlling the plane with wires, hydraulics, or electric motors.
Researchers investigate nervous system function at all three levels. This is typi￾cally easiest to do for parts of the nervous system close to sensory input or motor 
output, where you can observe the correlation between the circuit and its result. 
For example, you can shine light on a photoreceptor and observe its electrical 
response. In the upcoming sections, we apply each of these three levels to look at 
different nervous system functions.
Recent technical progress in physiological measurement and neural response 
manipulation has expanded understanding into the middle of the brain — where 
the greatest mysteries remain.
Pooling sensory input
One place in the nervous system where considerable work has been done at the 
circuit level is the retina. On the computational level, the retina’s job is to allow 
you to see. On the algorithmic level, the retina allows you to see using five major 
cell types arranged in two synaptic layers that extract and transmit specific 
aspects of the visual world to the brain. On the physical implementation level, the 
information sent to the brain goes over the axons of about 30 different ganglion 
cell classes, each of which has a representative at almost every point in the retina.
Neural convergence occurs when the inputs from many sources are pooled and 
transmitted in the output of fewer neurons. For example, the retinas of animals 
that are at least partially nocturnal have large numbers of the photoreceptors 
called rods. Rods can operate in light levels where only a few photons per second 
are available to be captured. The rods have multiple photopigment molecules that 
capture photons and multiple rods that connect to downstream cells. Pooling 
inputs sacrifices preserving information about exactly where the photon was CHAPTER 5 Transmitting to Targets 99
absorbed to increase sensitivity. Pooling is common in sensory system relays to 
the brain, and commonly deals with sensitivity-efficiency trade-offs.
Coordinating motor output
Walking or swimming to get somewhere (computational) requires multiple mus￾cles in multiple limbs to coordinate with each other in time and space. This coor￾dination involves neural sensors that report limb position and forces and neural 
integrating circuits that coordinate and sequence limb movements (algorithmic). 
A hierarchy of controllers work together to coordinate these sequences, starting 
with simple reflex controllers in the spinal cord, to spinal cord cyclic pattern gen￾erators, to error generation in the cerebellum that interact with the thalamus, 
basal ganglia, and motor cortex (implementation).
The superior colliculus is a good example of a controlled motor output for 
which the neural basis is known. This midbrain structure receives a large input 
from the retina, so it has cells in its superficial layers that respond to visual input. 
But the function (computational) of the superior colliculus appears to be to code 
eye movements  — saccades  — for orienting your attention (algorithmic). This 
happens by a projection from the superior colliculus to the pulvinar and frontal 
lobe areas of the brain, leading to eye movement. Shocking a given area on the 
colliculus produces an eye movement toward a particular visual field position. 
Thus, higher-than-normal activity somewhere in the periphery may cause an eye 
movement to occur to place central vision at that area to resolved greater detail.
Comparing brains to computers
The computational theory of mind (also called computational theory of cognition) holds 
that the mind is a computational system like a computer. This computer metaphor 
draws an analogy between the mind as software and the brain as hardware.
One of the hottest topics in neuroscience is comparing the computational power 
of the brain with that of computers. But how do you compare the two? You know 
that human and animal brains can do things  — such as recognize complex 
patterns — that are extremely difficult to program computers to do. Of course, 
computers can do things like calculate the value of π to thousands of decimal 
places in a few milliseconds, which humans can’t do.
Brains and computers compute in fundamentally different ways, even when doing 
the same task (same computation, probably different algorithms, and certainly 
different implementations). Only the human brain uses neurons. However, 
artificial intelligence uses what’s called deep learning where hundreds of layers of 
hundreds of simulated neuron-like elements are used for pattern recognition and 
generation and language processing.100 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Given what is known about how neurons work, how do they do computations 
and what sort of computations do they do? If you think of a very simple case where 
a neuron has two inputs, each of which by itself is above the threshold (more 
properly, the voltage at the soma due to the net synaptic current produced by 
those inputs is above the threshold), then the neuron is like an OR gate (it fires if 
either one or the other input is active).
But if the somatic response to each of the two input neurons (inputs A and B) is a 
bit less than half as much as the threshold, the neuron becomes an AND gate. That 
is, the output neuron is active only if both A and B inputs are active.
Because the output of neurons can also be inhibitory, they can function as 
inverters, or NOT gates. The combination of OR, AND, and NOT is more than suf￾ficient for the nervous system to implement the same logical power as present in 
digital computer circuits.
In trying to compare the computing power of brains to computers, several prob￾lems remain. Most digital computers are serial devices, executing one instruction 
at a time. The brain is massively parallel, however, potentially executing billion 
of actions simultaneously. Individual synapses in neurons can also execute 
complex analog computations such as multiplication, division, and logarithmic 
transforms that make them more like analog than digital computers. Neurobiolo￾gists clearly need to know more about how neurons actually work in neural 
circuits. (Chapter 20 briefly discusses some techniques that neurobiologists use 
to study neurons and the nervous system.)CHAPTER 6 Communicating through Chemicals 101

Communicating 
through Chemicals
I
n chemical synaptic transmission, neurons synthesize and release neurotrans￾mitters from their presynaptic axon that work by activating receptors on 
postsynaptic targets. Chapter 5 discusses the general mechanisms of synaptic 
transmission and how neurotransmitters function.
In this chapter we describe the specifics of synaptic transmission. Which types 
of  neurons use which neurotransmitters? What are the responses to specific 
neurotransmitters and what are their functions?
Activating with Acetylcholine
Acetylcholine (ACh) was the first neurotransmitter identified. Neurons that syn￾thesize and release ACh are cholinergic neurons. Here we describe the locations, 
receptors, and functions of cholinergic neurons.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Moving and concentrating with 
acetylcholine
» Acting fast with amino acids
» Pausing with purines
» Modulating with monoamines
» Narrating with neuropeptides102 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Working with cholinergic neurons
Cholinergic neurons are found in both the central nervous system (CNS) and 
peripheral nervous system (PNS). ACh is produced by the enzyme choline acetyl￾transferase in the presynaptic region and packaged into synaptic vesicles by the 
vesicular ACh transporter.
Some synaptic vesicles are docked at the presynaptic active zone. Depolarization 
of the presynaptic region by an action potential induces synaptic vesicle fusion 
and ACh release. In the cleft, ACh is degraded by acetylcholinesterase to acetate 
and choline.
Stimulating nicotinic receptors
Nicotinic receptors are ionotropic receptors. Nicotine is an effective agonist at this 
receptor type in the brain but not in muscles. Antagonists include hexametho￾nium, tubocurarine, and alpha-bungarotoxin from snake venom.
Nicotinic receptors form a channel from five subunits arranged around a central 
pore. ACh binding causes a conformational change that opens the channel pore 
that is permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium. At the resting membrane 
potential there’s a large driving force for sodium while the driving force for potas￾sium at rest is small (see Chapter 4). The majority of the ionic current through an 
open nicotinic receptor will be a sodium current that depolarizes the membrane 
potential.
Expanding with muscarinic receptors
The other types of ACh receptors are muscarinic (M) receptors that are metabo￾tropic, G protein coupled receptors. Muscarine is an agonist at M receptors, while 
atropine and scopolamine are M receptor antagonists. There are five M receptor 
isoforms: M1, M3, and M5 receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase. M2 and M4 receptors 
affect ion channels and activate the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Through reg￾ulation of ion channels and second messengers, muscarinic receptors modulate 
many cellular functions.
Contracting muscles
Somatic lower motor neurons are cholinergic and their cell bodies are located in 
the brainstem and spinal cord. Their axons are myelinated by Schwann cells and 
form somatic motor components of cranial or spinal nerves. Their axons inner￾vate skeletal muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to control skeletal 
muscle contraction and relaxation.CHAPTER 6 Communicating through Chemicals 103
At the NMJ, the motor neuron action potentials lead to ACh release. Skeletal 
muscle cells express nicotinic ACh receptors. When the receptor is activated by 
ACh, sodium flows into the muscle producing an end plate potential. This large 
(~50  millivolt) depolarization activates voltage-gated sodium and potassium 
channels, leading to a muscle action potential and increase in calcium that 
activates muscle contraction.
Mediating autonomic functions
In both the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous 
system, the lower motor neurons are preganglionic neurons. They’re cholinergic 
neurons located in the brainstem and spinal cord. They extend their axons out to 
postganglionic neurons located in autonomic ganglia. Postganglionic neurons 
express nicotinic receptors, which produce depolarizations that can lead to the 
output of action potentials.
Affecting target organs
All postganglionic neurons in the parasympathetic system are cholinergic neu￾rons. They extend their axons to their target organs, including the pupil, heart, 
lungs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs. The cells in these target organs 
respond to ACh through M receptors.
Depending on the M receptor isoform and G protein activated, ACh can produce 
slow excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory responses on the target cardiac muscle, 
smooth muscles, or gland. In contrast, most sympathetic postganglionic use nor￾epinephrine as their neurotransmitter, described in the section “Becoming alert 
with norepinephrine” later in this chapter.
Stimulating in the brain
Cholinergic neurons are also found in the brain. Although they represent only 
about 5 percent of total brain neurons, they’re crucial. Cholinergic neuron cell 
bodies are located in the basal forebrain, basal ganglia, and brainstem.
Most brain cholinergic neurons are projection/principal neurons that extend 
axons to innervate subcortical and cortical regions. This provides diffuse but 
widespread cholinergic input to numerous different neurons. Target neurons 
respond to ACh through nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors.104 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Focusing your attention and remembering
In the brain, ACh is involved in arousal, attention, cognitive functions, and REM 
sleep. It has been implicated in hypothalamic functions including temperature 
regulation, circadian rhythms, and food intake. Cholinergic neurons innervate the 
prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. They’re involved in working memory and 
have been shown to modulate the encoding of long-term declarative (semantic 
and episodic) memory.
The role of ACh in memory may involve its activity to promote synaptic plasticity. 
An early pathological change in Alzheimer’s disease is the dysfunction of cholin￾ergic neurons in the basal forebrain. Inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase are used to 
treat Alzheimer’s disease and the autoimmune disorder myasthenia gravis (refer 
to Chapters 12 and 15).
Exciting with Glutamate
Neurons that synthesize and release the amino acid glutamate are glutamatergic 
neurons, the most abundant neurons in the CNS. Glutamate is excitatory because 
the majority of responses are depolarizations that increase firing of action 
potentials. Aspartate is an amino acid neurotransmitter in invertebrates and lower 
vertebrates. Whether aspartate plays a physiological role in mammalian synaptic 
transmission hasn’t been resolved. The next sections examine the location and 
functions of glutamatergic neurons and features of glutamate receptors.
Finding glutamate
Glutamate can be obtained from the diet, synthesized in the Krebs cycle, or pro￾duced by glutaminase. In the presynaptic region, glutamate is transported into 
synaptic vesicles by the vesicular glutamate transporter.
In the entire cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and amygdala, 
only two types of neurons are present:
» Glutamatergic: In these areas, glutamatergic neurons make up an estimated 
70 percent of the neurons.
» Gamma amino butyric acid (GABAergic): The other 30 percent of neurons 
use the inhibitory amino acid GABA.
Glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons receive synaptic inputs from neurons that 
release glutamate, GABA, ACh, monoamines, and/or neuropeptides.CHAPTER 6 Communicating through Chemicals 105
Activating glutamate receptors
The two functional categories of glutamate receptors are
» Ionotropic receptors: Three types of ionotropic receptors can be distin￾guished using the drugs AMPA, kainate, and NMDA. All types bind glutamate 
in vivo and are permeable to sodium and potassium.
When activated, the main current produced by AMPA and kainate receptors is 
a sodium current because of the greater driving force for sodium at rest. The 
ionotropic receptors produce fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). 
We highlight the differences between ionotropic receptor types in the next 
section.
» Metabotropic receptors: The other type is the metabotropic receptor 
(mGluR), a G protein-coupled receptor. G protein activation can include 
effects on ion channels and second messenger signaling pathways.
Specializing in ionotropic receptors
AMPA and kainate receptors are similar and are often described together. The 
NMDA receptor is distinct from AMPA/kainate receptors in three ways: 
» In addition to binding glutamate, NMDA receptors also require glycine as a 
co-agonist. And they can be modulated by binding D-serine.
» NMDA receptors require glutamate and depolarization to be active. At the 
resting potential, a magnesium ion blocks the channel pore. Depolarization of 
the membrane removes the magnesium from the pore and allows sodium, 
potassium, and calcium to flow through.
» NMDA receptors are permeable to calcium, sodium, and potassium. Inside the 
postsynaptic neuron, calcium functions as a second messenger that can 
regulate additional neuronal activities over a longer time course.
Transmitting at glutamate synapses
In fast excitatory synaptic transmission, AMPA/kainate receptor channels are 
opened first because they require only glutamate to be activated. They produce 
EPSPs that are typically small responses, about a millivolt or less.106 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
After the membrane becomes depolarized, NMDA receptors contribute to the 
depolarization with sodium and calcium influx. The calcium binds calmodulin to 
activate downstream effectors, including kinases, phosphatases, proteases, and 
enzymes that make additional messengers.
Contributing metabotropic receptors
Activation of mGluRs modulate synaptic transmission in the CNS. Group I mGluRs 
stimulate PLC while both group II and group III mGluRs activate potassium 
channels and inhibit adenyl cyclase.
The effects of mGluRs include changes in membrane excitability, metabolic 
activities, neuronal morphology, and gene expression. AMPA/kainate and NMDA 
receptors, as well as mGluRs have been implicated in neuronal survival and 
neuroplasticity.
Sorting out spines
The majority of glutamatergic synapses occur on dendritic spines. Many glutama￾tergic neurons and some GABAergic neurons contain dendritic spines. Dendritic 
spines can express both AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors colocalized at the 
postsynaptic density. mGluRs are often located in spines in the perisynaptic or 
extra-synaptic area. Both ionotropic and mGluRs can be localized at the presyn￾aptic region as well.
Depending on the synapse, glutamate can act in wiring transmission and/or 
volume transmission. At some synapses the spillover of glutamate outside the 
synapse can activate extra-synaptic receptors or even nearby synapses.
Commanding information flow
Glutamatergic neurons are found in every region of the CNS and have been impli￾cated in all aspects of brain function involving fast excitatory transmission. This 
includes sensory systems and perception, motor control and coordination, cogni￾tion including memory, emotion, and consciousness.
The drugs AMPA, kainite, and NMDA are glutamate receptor agonists. Glutamate 
receptor antagonists include memantine, ketamine, and phencyclidine. Research 
initially suggested that ketamine’s therapeutic effects in treating depression were 
mediated by blocking NMDA receptors. Recent studies suggest that ketamine’s 
effects may involve additional receptors.CHAPTER 6 Communicating through Chemicals 107
Adapting to encode memories
Glutamatergic synapses can undergo synaptic plasticity in the developing and 
adult brain (refer to Chapters 3 and 15). During brain development, activity depen￾dent plasticity leads to strengthening, weakening, or loss of synapses underlying 
developing circuits in sensory, motor, and cognitive systems.
In the adult brain, synaptic plasticity in glutamate synapses has been well studied 
in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum, regions involved in encoding of 
long-term memory. We discuss the synaptic and molecular mechanisms under￾lying synaptic plasticity in Chapter 15.
Removing the signal
Glutamate is removed from the synapse by plasma membrane glutamate trans￾porters named excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) located on presynaptic 
and postsynaptic membranes, and nearby astrocytes. EAATs control the magni￾tude and duration of the EPSPs. Disruption of EAATs have been implicated in 
glutamate excitotoxicity, described in the section “Getting toxic with too much 
activity” later in this chapter.
Inhibiting with GABA and Glycine
GABAergic neurons are the main inhibitory neurons and are the second most 
abundant neuron type in the CNS. GABA is synthesized by the enzyme glutamate 
decarboxylase. It’s an amino acid but not one used in protein synthesis. The other 
inhibitory amino acid is glycine. Both GABA and glycine are transported into syn￾aptic vesicles by the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter. Here we discuss 
the locations of GABAergic and glycinergic neurons, the characteristics of their 
receptors, and their functions.
Calming neurons down
GABAergic neurons are found in all regions of the brain and spinal cord where 
they represent about 20 to 30 percent of all neurons. Glycinergic neurons are 
found in the hindbrain, spinal cord, and retina. Neurons in the spinal cord co￾release GABA and glycine in response to action potential stimulation. The function 
of this co-release hasn’t been identified.108 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
GABAergic and glycinergic neurons in the CNS have a major function in 
controlling  neuronal excitability. Many types of GABAergic neurons differ in 
their morphology, gene expression, and the neuropeptides they release.
One proposed function for GABAergic neurons is in regulation of network oscilla￾tions important for information processing. GABAergic neurons are involved in 
motor control, sensory processing, emotion, cognitive functions, and sleep.
The majority of GABAergic neurons function as local circuit neurons that control 
the excitability and output of nearby glutamatergic neurons. However, there are 
some exceptions.
A few GABAergic projection neurons are present in the CNS: 
» Purkinje neurons are GABAergic and represent the sole output from the 
cerebellar cortex to the deep cerebellar nuclei.
» GABAergic neurons in the basal ganglia nuclei project to other regions of the 
basal ganglia or out to the thalamus.
» Inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic interneurons in the spinal cord can 
synapse on lower motor neurons.
Inhibiting with chloride
Two types of GABA receptors, ionotropic (GABAA) and metabotropic (GABAB), 
mediate the effects of GABA. The effects of glycine are mediated by only ionotropic 
receptors. Ionotropic GABA and glycine receptors are formed by five subunits 
arranged around a central pore. The channels in the GABA and glycine receptors 
are selective for chloride. Chloride typically flows down its electrochemical gradi￾ent into the neuron, hyperpolarizing it and producing a fast inhibitory postsynaptic 
potential (IPSP).
In neurons, the Nernst potential for chloride is close to the resting membrane 
potential. Activating GABAA or glycine receptors at rest doesn’t have a large effect 
on the membrane potential. However, if the membrane potential is depolarized by 
nearby glutamate synapses, this increases the driving force for chloride and the 
GABA or glycine response will be a larger IPSP.
Shunting the current
In shunting inhibition, the inhibitory synaptic conductances short-circuit the 
currents generated at adjacent excitatory synapses. Say a neuron receives GABA CHAPTER 6 Communicating through Chemicals 109
inhibitory receptor activation at the same time it receives excitatory glutamate 
receptor activation. The chloride current from GABA receptor activation can reduce 
the excitatory depolarization by reducing membrane resistance, causing shunting 
inhibition.
Most inhibitory synapses are located on dendritic shafts and the cell soma. There￾fore inhibitory synapses may contribute relatively more to the overall membrane 
potential, control the excitability of the neuron and regulate its action potential 
output. Their shunting effect is also larger there.
Regulating GABA receptors
Many drugs that target GABAA receptors are used therapeutically for the treatment 
of epilepsy, anxiety, and as sedatives and muscle relaxants. These drugs work as 
allosteric modulators that increase the chloride conductance when endogenous 
GABA binds. These drugs include alprazolam (Xanax), zolpidem (Ambien), and 
anesthetics (propofol).
Drugs that enhance GABAA receptor activation can have anxiolytic, anticon￾vulsant, sedative, hypnotic, euphoriant, and/or muscle relaxant properties. The 
GABAA receptor antagonist flumazenil is used for sedative drug overdose.
The other type of receptors are GABAB receptors that are metabotropic G protein￾coupled receptors. Some GABAB receptors stimulate potassium channels named 
GIRK channels that lead to inhibition. Other GABAB receptors inhibit calcium 
channels or affect adenyl cyclase to produce inhibitory or modulatory effects. 
GABAB receptors can be expressed at synapses with GABAA receptors in both 
presynaptic and postsynaptic regions.
GABAB receptors are important in the developing brain, in regulating oscillatory 
activity in neuronal networks and in adult cognitive functions such as memory. 
They’ve also been implicated in drug misuse, anxiety, and depression. An agonist 
at this receptor is baclofen, a drug used as a muscle relaxant and treatment for 
spasticity.
Integrating and Maintaining the Balance
Neurons can receive thousands of synaptic EPSPs and IPSPs that are transmitted 
passively along dendrites where they’re integrated in the process of summation
that we discuss in Chapter 4. When the balance tips in favor of excitation, the 
neuron may fire an action potential. The ratio of excitation and inhibition is 110 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
critical for normal brain processing and computation. Here we discuss the effects 
when the ratio becomes unbalanced.
Balancing the inputs
The activity of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses need to be carefully regu￾lated to maintain the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic trans￾mission. Disruption of this balance can have severe consequences:
» Too much glutamatergic transmission or too little GABAergic activity can lead 
to seizures.
» Too little glutamatergic or too much GABAergic transmission can lead to coma.
Shifts in the excitation/inhibition ratio may be involved in brain disorders includ￾ing epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.
Getting toxic with too much activity
Pathological conditions, including traumatic brain injury, severe seizure activity, 
or stroke can lead to excessive glutamate release and prolonged glutamate trans￾mission that can result in glutamate excitotoxicity. High glutamate levels activate 
AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors leading to large amounts of calcium influx.
High levels of calcium can activate enzymes that produce reactive oxygen species 
and proteases that lead to break down of proteins and the cell membrane and 
cause dysfunction of mitochondria. All of these can lead to neuronal cell death. 
Glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in neuronal damage in epilepsy, 
stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.
Signaling with Purines
ATP and adenosine are two purine neurotransmitters that are neuromodulators 
in the CNS and PNS. ATP is the major form of cellular energy currency, but it’s 
also transported into synaptic vesicles, in some cases with other neurotransmit￾ters. ATP can be released from synaptic vesicles and bind to synaptic receptors. 
The ATP in the synaptic cleft is also used as an energy source and broken down to 
adenosine. The following sections discuss the receptors and functions for ATP 
and adenosine.CHAPTER 6 Communicating through Chemicals 111
Finding receptors everywhere
ATP and adenosine bind to specific purinergic receptors expressed in neurons and 
glial cells. The ionotropic receptors are the P2X receptors. P2X receptors are non￾selective cation channels that conduct sodium, potassium, and calcium. They bind 
ATP better than adenosine. The metabotropic ATP receptors are the P2Y receptors 
that activate PLC or regulate adenylyl cyclase. P2X and P2Y receptors are expressed 
throughout the CNS and PNS and are localized to both presynaptic and postsyn￾aptic regions. They modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity by effects on 
ion channels, receptors, and gene expression.
In postganglionic and somatic motor neurons, ATP is co-released with ACh or 
norepinephrine. Sensory axons co-release ATP in the spinal cord. In the taste 
system, ATP is released by taste receptor cells in response to tastants where it 
activates purinergic receptors in taste relay neurons. ATP receptors are expressed 
throughout the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem.
Snoozing with adenosine
The adenosine P1 receptors include the A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors. The A1Rs 
and A3Rs inhibit adenylyl cyclase and calcium channels and activate potassium 
channels. A2A and A2B receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase. A2Rs and A3Rs may 
also activate PLC. A1Rs are highly expressed by neurons in the neocortex, hippo￾campus, cerebellum, and brainstem. Presynaptic A1 and A2A receptors modulate 
neurotransmitter release. The A2B and A3 receptors are expressed at lower levels 
in many CNS regions.
Through its effects on ion channels and second messengers, adenosine is neuro￾modulatory. The neuromodulatory effects of adenosine are mediated though the 
activation of P1 receptors that act on ion channels and second messengers. 
Adenosine inhibits neuronal excitability.
One widely accepted function for adenosine is in sleep. During waking periods, as 
ATP is used as an energy source and dephosphorylated, the levels of adenosine 
increase in synapses, most notably in the basal forebrain. Adenosine levels peak in 
the evening before sleep and then decrease during sleep as ATP is regenerated.
Adenosine receptors function to decrease neuronal activity and facilitate sleep. 
Adenosine is involved in slow wave sleep and modulates the release of neurotrans￾mitters in brain regions known to be involved in sleep.
Adenosine and its receptors have also been implicated in the CNS in learning and 
memory. In the periphery, adenosine is involved in non-neural cells in modula￾tion of vascular function and immune responses.112 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Modulating with Monoamines
The three categories of monoamine neurotransmitters are 
» Catecholamines, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine
» Indolamines like serotonin
» Histamine
Monoamine neurons represent only a small percentage of total brain neurons, but 
they have essential neuromodulatory functions. The majority of monoamine 
neuronal cell bodies are located in distinct nuclei in the brainstem, while their 
axons extend out to innervate many brain regions.
Monoamines, which we examine in greater detail in the following sections, are 
synthesized in the presynaptic region from amino acids and transported into syn￾aptic vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporters.
Each monoamine activates its specific metabotropic receptors that function 
in  neuromodulation. Only serotonin also has ionotropic receptor subtypes. 
Monoamines are removed from the synapse by plasma membrane transporters 
that are specific for each monoamine.
Feeling motivated with dopamine
Neurons that synthesize and release dopamine are dopaminergic neurons. Their 
cell bodies are located in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area in the 
midbrain. Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. Dopaminergic 
neurons project to nearly every region of the brain. Dopamine is involved in motor 
control, pleasure and euphoria, motivation and reward, reward-driven learning, 
and cognitive functions. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia 
nigra occurs in Parkinson’s disease.
Five subtypes of dopamine receptors are expressed. D1-like receptors are mainly 
postsynaptic, activate the cAMP pathway, and can be excitatory or inhibitory. 
D2-like receptors are located in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic area, 
inhibit the cAMP pathway, and usually produce inhibition. Many antipsychotic 
drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are antagonists 
of D2-like receptors.CHAPTER 6 Communicating through Chemicals 113
Becoming alert with norepinephrine
Neurons that synthesize and release norepinephrine are noradrenergic neurons. 
Their cell bodies are located in the locus coeruleus in the pons. Norepinephrine is 
synthesized from dopamine. The general function of norepinephrine is to mobi￾lize the brain and body for action. In the CNS norepinephrine regulates attention, 
arousal, and alertness, sleep and wake cycles, pleasure and anxiety, sensory pro￾cessing, and learning and memory.
In the PNS, norepinephrine is the main neurotransmitter released by sympathetic 
postganglionic neurons to their target organs and tissues and mediates the 
fight-or-flight response.
Epinephrine is synthesized from norepinephrine in adrenergic neurons located in 
the lateral tegmental system and medulla. The functions of epinephrine in the 
CNS aren’t well characterized. In the PNS, sympathetic stimulation of the adrenal 
gland releases both epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood.
Norepinephrine and epinephrine work through adrenergic receptors. Alpha and 
beta adrenergic receptors are expressed throughout the CNS and PNS.  In the 
brain adrenergic receptors are present in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, 
brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum. As metabotropic receptors working 
through G  proteins, they can activate the PLC pathway or regulate the cAMP 
pathway. Phenylephrine is an agonist of the alpha 1 receptor while clonidine is 
an antagonist of the alpha -2 receptor. Isoproterenol is a beta receptor agonist 
while propranolol, a beta blocker, is a beta receptor antagonist.
Affecting mood with serotonin
Neurons that synthesize and release serotonin are serotonergic neurons. 
Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. Chemically it’s 
5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT). Serotonergic cell bodies are located in the dorsal 
Raphe nuclei in the midbrain and pons. Serotonergic neurons project throughout 
the brain, including the cerebral cortex. Serotonin is involved in mood, arousal, 
memory processing, circadian rhythms, appetite and eating, cognition, and 
motor behaviors. The dysfunction of serotonin pathways has been implicated in 
depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Five types of ionotropic 5HT receptors and ten 5HT metabotropic receptor iso￾forms have been identified. Ionotropic receptors are nonselective cation channels 
that produce EPSPs. The metabotropic receptors work through G proteins that 
activate PLC or regulate cAMP pathways. Serotonin (5HT) receptors are expressed 
throughout the CNS and are located in both postsynaptic and presynaptic regions. 
5HT1A receptor agonists such as buspirone have shown efficacy in relieving 
depression and anxiety. 5HT2A receptor antagonists have antipsychotic properties.114 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Rewiring with serotonin
Serotonin receptor subtypes 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A are involved in regulating syn￾aptic plasticity. Serotonin stimulates dendritic branching and formation of new 
neurons, which can lead to new synapse formation. Serotonin has also been impli￾cated in adaptation to environmental and adaptive plasticity.
The effects of serotonin are consistent with neuroplasticity actions of psycho￾plastogens like psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine (from ayahuasca) and lysergic acid 
diethylamide (LSD). These are serotonin receptor agonists.
Resting with histamine
Histaminergic neuron cell bodies are located in the hypothalamus. They project 
throughout the forebrain and function in wakefulness and sleep, modulation of 
the circadian rhythm and have a role in nausea.
One side effect of centrally acting antihistamines is drowsiness, supporting the 
role for histamine in wakefulness.
Targeting transporters
Monoamines are transported into the presynaptic neuron by plasma membrane 
transporters. Specific transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin 
have been identified. The majority of approved antidepressants act through 
monoaminergic mechanisms, including these transporters.
Antidepressants include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs such as 
Prozac, and Zoloft), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors used to treat 
depression and fibromyalgia, and tricyclic antidepressants (nonselective mono￾amine uptake inhibitors).
The monoamine hypothesis of depression was well accepted in the last century. 
However today it’s clear that disruption of neuroplasticity occurs in depression 
and that antidepressants may work by restoring neuroplasticity in areas involved 
in mood and cognition.
Ketamine and the psychoplastogens are being investigated as fast-acting antide￾pressants that may rapidly rewire the brain to restore disrupted neuroplasticity 
and restore circuits.CHAPTER 6 Communicating through Chemicals 115
Getting your attention
The therapeutic drugs Ritalin (methylphenidate) and Adderall, which are used to 
treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), function by acting on dopa￾mine transporters and increasing synaptic dopamine levels, though by different 
mechanisms:
» Ritalin blocks the plasma membrane dopamine transporter and reduces 
dopamine reuptake.
» Adderall blocks the vesicular monoamine transporter and reduces uptake of 
dopamine into synaptic vesicles. It also reverses the direction of the plasma 
membrane dopamine transporter.
The recreational drugs of misuse amphetamine and methamphetamine work like 
Adderall does, while cocaine behaves in a similar manner to Ritalin.
Recreational drugs that affect monoamines are more potent than their therapeutic 
counterparts, leading to psychoactive effects, rewiring of circuits that lead to tol￾erance, and increasing the potential for addiction and misuse.
Behaving with Neuropeptides
Neuropeptides are short polypeptides that function as modulatory neurotrans￾mitters when released at synapses in the brain. A few neuropeptides (oxytocin and 
vasopressin) also function as hormones when released into the blood. And hypo￾thalamic neurons release neuropeptides onto pituitary cells, stimulating the 
release of pituitary hormones into the blood.
More than a hundred known neuropeptides have been identified in mammals, 
with more than a thousand genes predicted to encode signaling peptides. Many 
neurons synthesize and release one small molecule and one neuropeptide 
neurotransmitter.
The following sections examine neuropeptide characteristics and functions.
Making and releasing peptides
Neuropeptides are synthesized in the cell soma by the rough endoplasmic reticu￾lum, packaged in the Golgi into secretory vesicles (or dense core vesicles), and 
transported along the axon to the presynaptic region. Some neuropeptides are 
cleaved by proteases during transport.116 PART 1 Getting Started with Neurobiology
Neuropeptide-containing vesicles are located farther away from the active zone, 
so they require a higher frequency of action potentials for release and can be 
released into the synaptic cleft or extracellular fluid. Neuropeptides function as 
neuromodulators by activating metabotropic receptors located in synaptic, pre￾synaptic, perisynaptic, and extra-synaptic regions.
Controlling behaviors
Some neuropeptides are used by small populations of neurons while others are 
used in neurons located throughout the brain. Many neuropeptides were initially 
discovered for their roles in the hypothalamus. And many neuropeptides function 
in regulating homeostatic and survival behaviors.
In the CNS, oxytocin has been implicated in mate-pair and parent-child bonding, 
pro-social behaviors, and empathy. In the CNS, neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been 
implicated in food intake, fat storage, and metabolism. In the PNS, NPY is released 
by sympathetic neurons with norepinephrine, and together they work as 
vasoconstrictors.
Current studies have examined neuropeptide function in the neocortex and 
hippocampus where NPY has been implicated in learning and memory.
Relieving pain and feeling happy
The endogenous opioid neuropeptides (enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins) 
bind to opioid receptors, the same receptors that bind morphine, heroin, and 
oxycodone. Endogenous opioids are involved in analgesia and euphoria. Neuro￾peptides may also play a role in migraine, with calcitonin gene related peptide 
(CGRP) antagonists are used in migraine treatment.
Neuropeptides aren’t actively removed from synapses but diffuse away. The neu￾ropeptide receptors are metabotropic receptors that produce different modulatory 
effects depending on the G protein involved.
Many neuropeptides are released together with small molecule neurotransmit￾ters, so their effects will be combined with that of their co-transmitter. Neuro￾peptides can produce effects on the membrane potential within seconds to 
minutes. They can also regulate metabolism and gene expression over the course 
of hours to days.2

Chapter 7
Moving Muscles with 
Motor Neurons
Even when you’re sitting quietly — perhaps as you are right now, reading this 
book  — your body is always moving. You consciously control some 
movements your body makes, whereas other types of movement happen 
without you even being aware.
The human body has distinct muscle types that produce involuntary and 
voluntary movements, all of which this chapter explores. Here we discuss how 
muscle cells contract to produce movements. The human body has different 
neural circuits that control these contractions. Speaking of circuits, this chapter 
tells you about sensory feedback circuits, which allow reflexes to occur quickly 
and automatically and take care of details of movement so you don’t have to 
concentrate on every step you take.
The final sections of this chapter discuss what exercise does to your muscles, 
gaining and losing muscle mass as you age, the difference in muscle composition 
between men and women, and how muscles could communicate with neurons. So, 
don’t move a muscle, and read on!

Making a Move: Muscle Types 
and What They Do
The body produces very different kinds of movement — from intestinal contrac￾tions to heartbeats to bending (flexion) and stretching (extension) of limbs. Dif￾ferent kinds of neural circuits control these movement types. There are circuits 
that mediate reflexes and involuntary movements, rhythmic motor patterns, and 
voluntary movement sequences that we consciously control. The following sec￾tions discuss the two major types of muscle in the body: smooth and striated.
Processing with smooth muscle
Smooth muscle controls many involuntary internal movements that you’re gener￾ally not aware of, such as stomach and intestinal contractions. Some smooth 
muscle contracts spontaneously, such as in the intestines, whereas for other 
types, contraction or relaxation is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. 
The body’s smooth muscles are located in a variety of places such as the walls of 
organs and blood vessels, the iris of the eye, the bladder, and the uterus.
Smooth muscles include single-unit and multiunit types:
» In single-unit smooth muscle, an action potential in one cell spreads to other 
muscle cells through gap junctions (refer to Chapter 5). The result is that the 
entire muscle — made of many cells — contracts as a unit.
» In multiunit smooth muscles, different motor neuron terminals innervate
individual muscle cells. This allows for variations in the strength of 
contractions and finer neural control.
Smooth muscle differs significantly in structure and function from striated mus￾cles, which are the cardiac and skeletal muscles. Though they also use actin and 
myosin for contraction, smooth muscle lacks sarcomeres and has no striations. It 
typically has greater elasticity that’s important in organs like the intestines and 
bladder.
Striated muscle for hearts and limbs
Striated muscles enable both involuntary and voluntary movements. It gets its 
name because of the striped appearance of repeating sarcomeres. The two major 
types of striated muscle are:CHAPTER 7 Moving Muscles with Motor Neurons 121
» Cardiac muscle: This type produces heartbeats, contractions of the heart 
muscle for pumping blood.
» Skeletal muscle: This type is attached to bones through tendons to produce 
movements of the body.
Body movements are controlled by the somatic motor system. Involuntary move￾ments include those for balance, posture, and coordination. Voluntary movements 
are those you’re fully conscious of — and are typically controlled by higher-level 
brain activity. Because muscles can only pull, and not push, many movements 
require the coordination of an agonist and antagonistic (opposite) muscle pairs. 
For example, most limb movements involve a flexor muscle and an extensor 
muscle pair.
A specialized type of striated muscle causes your heart to beat intrinsically with a 
force like that of voluntary muscle. The heart beats on its own because of its own 
pacemaker cells. The force and rate of your heartbeat isn’t usually under con￾scious control because the autonomic nervous system regulates it.
The following sections delve deeper into these two types of striated muscles.
Cardiac muscle
Cardiac muscle, striated muscle that is responsible for the involuntary contrac￾tions of the heart, is formed by cells called myocardiocytes or cardiomyocytes.
Cardiac muscle is very resistant to fatigue because it has a high density of 
mitochondria. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle relies on actin and myosin for 
contraction, giving it a striated appearance from sarcomeres. Unlike skeletal 
muscle, the heart doesn’t require innervation by motor neurons to contract.
The natural pacemaker of the heart is a cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node. It 
generates electrical impulses that cause the heart’s chambers to contract, setting 
the baseline heartbeat. The autonomic nervous system controls the heartbeat’s 
force and rate, similar to how smooth muscle is controlled.
Skeletal muscle
Skeletal muscle consists of long, thin cells called muscle fibers. Each muscle fiber 
typically extends the entire length of the muscle and is up to 30 centimeters long, 
but less than 0.1 millimeter wide. Muscle fibers are multinucleated cells that arise 
from the fusion of immature myoblasts during development.
Skeletal muscle contraction is controlled by the activity of somatic alpha motor 
neurons. Synaptic transmission occurs at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) — 
see Chapters 5 and 6. Acetylcholine is released by the motor neuron and binds to 122 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
receptors on the muscle cell, producing the end plate potential, which triggers a 
muscle cell action potential. Each muscle action potential produces a contraction 
of the muscle fiber, called a twitch. Contraction is based on the movement of myo￾sin and actin myofibrils. We describe the molecular events of muscle contraction 
in the section “Pulling Your Weight: How Muscle Cells Contract” later in this 
chapter.
The two major types of skeletal muscle fibers are Type I (slow-twitch) fibers and 
Type II (fast-twitch) fibers, both of which are present in most skeletal muscles, 
but in varying ratios. The characteristics of both types are as follows:
» Type I, slow-twitch fibers: Muscles with a majority of slow-twitch fibers are 
dense with mitochondria and myoglobin, which give its characteristic dark red 
color. Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding protein related to hemoglobin. Slow￾twitch fibers can contract for long periods of time, but with less rate and force 
than fast-twitch. They regenerate ATP in aerobic metabolism using oxygen in 
mitochondria and don’t fatigue.
» Type II, fast-twitch fibers: Type II, fast-twitch fibers contract rapidly and 
powerfully. They’re the main fiber type that contribute to the total force a 
muscle can exert. The two subtypes include the following:
• Type IIx fibers: Known as the speed champions, these fibers can contract 
up to ten times faster than Type I fibers. But type IIx fibers fatigue rapidly 
because they’re anaerobic (using glycolysis without oxygen to make ATP) 
and are pale in color because they have less mitochondria and myoglobin.
• Type IIa fibers: In contrast, these fibers are medium-speed fibers that 
contract at an intermediate speed, between that of Type I and Type IIx. 
Type IIa use both anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic mitochondria to 
produce ATP and are more resistant to fatigue.
Short intense bursts of activity using Type II fibers result in delayed onset 
muscle soreness. This was originally proposed to result from a buildup of 
lactic acid. Recent research shows that pain results from small amounts of 
damage to muscles and surrounding connective tissue, which increase muscle 
growth through repair processes.
Type I and type IIa fibers use aerobic metabolism, whereas type IIx fibers use 
mainly anaerobic metabolism. Performing endurance activities such as marathon 
running depends mostly on aerobic slow-twitch fibers. Short-duration power 
movements, such as sprinting, use more anaerobic fast-twitch fibers. This results 
in an energy/oxygen debt that the body must pay back over time by consuming 
foods that produce glucose (but a necessary and worthwhile one when escaping a 
predator, for example).CHAPTER 7 Moving Muscles with Motor Neurons 123
Twitching fast and slow: 
Muscle composition
The ratio of fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers is varied in muscles in 
humans. People with a smaller percentage of fast-twitch fibers may be better 
marathon runners; those with a larger percentage, better sprinters. One effect of 
weight-bearing exercise is to increase the percentage of fast-twitch fiber mass in 
the muscle, which increases strength.
Pulling Your Weight: How Muscle 
Cells Contract
Muscles can only pull, not push. Antagonistic muscle pairs control your limbs — 
the flexor flexes (bends) the limb and the extensor extends (straightens) the limb. 
Figure 7-1 shows the antagonistic pair that moves the lower leg. The quadriceps is 
the extensor that straightens the leg and supports you in an upright position. The 
hamstring is the flexor that bends the leg when you walk.
Muscle cells are excitable cells like neurons because they produce action poten￾tials. Skeletal muscles contract in a sequence of events. It starts with the motor 
neuron releasing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and ends with actin and 
myosin filaments sliding over each other in a contraction. We outline the events 
in the next section.

Somatic motor neurons control skeletal muscle contraction. Skeletal muscles are 
innervated by alpha and gamma motor neurons (refer to the section “Under￾standing motor neurons” later in this chapter) whose cell bodies are located in the 
spinal cord or brainstem, but whose axons are located in the spinal or cranial 
nerves. Synaptic transmission at vertebrate muscles involves acetylcholine 
released by alpha motor neurons. Read on to find out how it all works.
Patterning muscle contractions
Skeletal muscles can be activated by reflexes, nonconscious motor pathways, 
rhythmic motor patterns, or consciously controlled voluntary movement 
sequences, which we discuss in the following list. For typical skeletal muscles, 
integration and output from the alpha motor neuron is the final common pathway 
for control of these movements. 
» Reflexes: A reflex involves the activation of a sensory receptor, such as a pain 
receptor, that fires action potentials in the limb when you touch something 
sharp (refer to the section “Withdrawing a limb in the flexor reflex” later in this 
chapter). The axon of this receptor projects to the spinal cord and excites, in a 
reflex arc, an alpha (lower) motor neuron that causes the body to withdraw 
the limb. Reflexes are also involved in proprioception.
» Unconsciously controlled muscle movement: Many involuntary move￾ments involve control by neurons located in the brainstem that form the 
extrapyramidal tracts. These tracts are involved in upright posture and 
balance, control of head and eye movements, coordination, and rhythmic 
motor patterns.
» Rhythmic motor patterns: Circuits in the spinal cord that are spread along 
the spine control rhythmic motor patterns. These circuits control sequences, 
such as the alternating movement of the two legs for walking and the 
alternating movement of the arms working in anti-phase with the legs.
» Consciously controlled muscle movement sequences: The output from 
upper motor neurons located primarily in the motor cortex control voluntary 
movements. The motor cortex receives inputs from other areas in the frontal 
lobe, sensory areas, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Upper motor 
neurons project to the brainstem or spinal cord. They synapse on interneurons 
and alpha motor neurons, which integrate many inputs for the control of 
output to muscles. Chapter 8 focuses on brain control of movement.CHAPTER 7 Moving Muscles with Motor Neurons 125
Understanding motor neurons
Alpha motor neurons are located in the spinal cord and brainstem. They receive 
direct inputs from upper motor neurons, from nearby interneurons, and some 
from sensory neurons. In the spinal cord their cell bodies lie in the ventral horn 
gray area. Their axons project to muscles and are contained in peripheral nerves. 
Thus, motor neurons are considered part of both the central and peripheral ner￾vous systems. In the brainstem, alpha motor neurons are located in cranial nerve 
motor nuclei. Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle, the major part of 
the muscle that produces contraction and force.
The other somatic motor neuron type that leaves the spinal cord or brainstem is 
the gamma motor neuron, which innervate intrafusal muscle fibers called muscle 
spindles, small regions inside the extrafusal muscle. Spindles are also innervated 
by sensory neurons and provide sensory feedback from muscle for somatic reflexes.
Eyeing the motor unit
A single alpha motor neuron, together with the many muscle fibers it innervates, 
is called a motor unit. Numerous motor units are typically involved in producing 
the contraction of a single muscle. A motor pool is the group of alpha and gamma 
motor neurons in the spinal cord that innervate and control a single muscle.
A given alpha motor neuron innervates only muscle fibers of the same type (I, IIa, 
or IIx). The alpha motor neuron action potential causes all the muscle fibers to 
which it projects to contract simultaneously. The force of the muscle contraction 
is controlled by the motor neuron rate of firing and number of motor units that 
are activated. The systematic recruitment of motor units is called the size principle,
which we discuss in the section “Recruiting motor units” later in this chapter. 
Muscle force also depends on the arrangement of muscle fibers.
Typically, motor units, which innervate muscles that control large body parts — 
like the legs — may synapse on and control up to 1,000 muscle fibers, whereas 
motor units that innervate small muscles may synapse on and control only ten 
muscle fibers. To achieve fine motor control, the body varies the activity of differ￾ent motor units to have a graded activation of muscle fibers.
Polio is a viral infection that leads to loss of alpha motor neurons. Rehabilitation 
from polio involves motor training so that the remaining alpha motor neurons can 
innervate more muscle fibers and restore some muscle force. As people age, they 
lose some of the remaining alpha motor neurons. In post-polio syndrome, so few 
alpha motor neurons are left that they can’t effectively innervate all the cells in 126 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
the muscle, and a person can regress to a pre-rehab state. Through vaccination, 
polio isn’t a threat to more than 99 percent of the world’s population, though tiny 
pockets of infection persist. New oral vaccines provide hope to eradicate polio.
Signaling at the neuromuscular junction
A single motor neuron axon branches and innervates many muscle cells of the 
same type. Typically, one muscle cell receives only a single input from a motor 
neuron axon terminal at the neuromuscular junction. During transmission, the 
motor neuron releases acetylcholine into the synapse. Nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors are located at the muscle motor end plate. Binding of acetylcholine 
opens the receptor channel and sodium flows into the muscle, producing the end 
plate potential. This depolarization triggers an action potential in the muscle 
membrane, by activation of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels.
Coupling excitation contraction
The muscle cell action potential activates voltage-gated calcium channels in the 
muscle (called L-type calcium channels). This causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
within the muscle cell to release calcium. This increase in calcium causes actin 
and myosin myofilaments to slide over each other to shorten their overlap (see 
Figure 7-2) and the muscle cell contracts along its length. The process of muscle 
contraction uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the energy source.
Figure 7-2 shows an alpha motor neuron axon branching into several terminals 
on the left; on the right, you see a magnified view of the neuromuscular junction. 
The curve shows the muscle end-plate potential.
FIGURE 7-2:

neuron terminal

Sliding filaments: Actin and myosin
The increased calcium in the muscle cell produces its effects by regulating a pro￾tein called troponin. In a relaxed muscle, calcium is low and troponin is bound to 
the actin filaments, preventing the actin from interacting with myosin. When the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium following the muscle action potential, 
that calcium binds to troponin. This causes troponin to partially release from 
actin, which allows the actin to bind with myosin.
Muscle cells are composed of multiple actin and myosin filaments in series. Myo￾sin first binds and then cleaves ATP, which induces the activated state of myosin. 
After calcium is released and opens the actin-binding sites, activated myosin 
binds to actin and function like a molecular ratchet. While bound to actin, the 
myosin protein rotates, and as the myosin protein moves, it pulls the actin fila￾ment along with it. The movement of multiple myosin proteins in its filament 
drags the entire actin filament, shortening the sarcomere. This shortens the entire 
muscle fiber and together with simultaneously shortening fibers, contracts the 
muscle.
Figure 7-3 shows how the muscle shortens, moving the Z lines closer together on 
the left. On the right is a detail of how the myosin filament ratchets move the actin 
fibrils along the myosin fibrils.

Controlling Muscle Contraction
Muscles can exert small or large forces. This enables a person to cradle an egg 
with the same hand that can break a board in martial arts. Muscle cells are long 
and thin and are organized lengthwise into muscle fibers. The more muscle fibers 
contract, the shorter the muscle gets and the more force can is produced. Muscle 
force is also dependent on how the fibers are arranged in the muscle.
Muscle force is controlled in two ways: 
» By the alpha motor neuron firing rate: The number, type, and activity of the 
alpha motors can precisely control muscle force to produce finely graded 
contraction forces.
» By the number and type of (slow or fast twitch) muscle cells activated:
This depends on the number and type of alpha motor neurons activated.
The following section explains these two mechanisms of muscle force control in 
greater detail. We also describe the inputs to the alpha motor neurons and how 
their axons are well insulated in nerves.
Modulating firing rate
One factor that determines muscle force is the frequency with which the muscle 
fibers are stimulated by their innervating alpha motor neurons, called the motor 
unit firing rate. This varies from single action potentials that produce a single￾twitch contraction, to firing rates of hundreds of action potentials per second that 
can produce maximal contraction, called a fused tetanic contraction. In general, the 
firing of many alpha motor neurons increases gradually (despite the activation of 
different muscle fiber types — see the next section) as muscle force is increased. 
This provides a nearly continuous ability to increase force as the muscle load 
demands.
Recruiting motor neurons
In stimulating muscles, motor neurons within a motor pool are activated in order 
from smallest to largest to increase the force being exerted from weak to strong. 
This is called the size principle. Alpha motor neurons that innervate Type I 
slow-twitch muscle fibers are activated first. They’re smaller diameter motor 
neurons and their target muscle fibers are smaller in mass. When greater forces 
are needed, the motor neurons that innervate Type II fast-twitch muscles are 
activated next. They’re larger diameter motor neurons and their target muscle 
fibers have greater mass.CHAPTER 7 Moving Muscles with Motor Neurons 129
Receiving inputs
Alpha (lower) motor neurons receive inputs from upper motor neurons in motor 
cortex, interneurons in the spinal cord or brain stem, and for some, from sensory 
neurons that innervate muscles, tendons, and joints. Integration from all these 
inputs controls the firing of alpha motor neurons. Gamma motor neurons are part 
of the motor pool and control intrafusal muscle fibers. Intrafusal fibers form 
muscle spindles involved in sensory feedback to the spinal cord for well￾controlled muscle activity.
Moving through action potentials
Alpha motor neuron axons are heavily myelinated by both oligodendrocytes and 
Schwann cells (refer to Chapter 1). These features increase the speed of action 
potential conduction, shortening the time between a central command or sensory 
reflex input, and action. Oligodendrocytes myelinate the short segment of the 
alpha motor neuron axon within the spinal cord or brainstem. As alpha motor 
neuron axons leave the spinal cord from the ventral root or the brainstem, they’re 
wrapped by Schwann cells along the length of the spinal or cranial nerve.
Reflexing without Reflecting
Reflexes are one of the most fundamental circuits in the central nervous system. 
In a reflex, sensory receptor activation produces a motor response through a very 
short monosynaptic pathway. It doesn’t require any higher brain input, is very 
rapid, and produces a stereotypical response. Here we describe the circuitry and 
function of several types of reflexes located in the spinal cord and brainstem.
Spinal reflexes: Proprioception 
and protection
To move your limbs, you need to know something about where they are when you 
start, and then be able to keep tabs on where they are as the movement pro￾gresses. Sensory receptors in muscles, joints, and tendons work in reflex circuits 
that allow your brain to know where its parts are and how they are moving, in a 
process called proprioception. In addition to providing important perception of 
space and movements, proprioception also plays an essential role in balance and 
posture.
When you encounter something harmful in the environment, activation of sen￾sory receptors causes your body to move quickly to avoid damage via the fast 130 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
reflex circuits in your spinal cord that also adjust for different loads and 
conditions.
What your brain does for limb position is like setting a thermostat to keep your 
home at a comfortable temperature. The thermostat sensor turns the furnace on 
if the temperature goes below a set point or off if the temperature goes above that 
point. This works regardless of the outside temperature (load) or changes in the 
furnace’s capacity (such as the air filter being dirty and clogged).
Muscle spindles and the stretch reflex
Muscle spindles are innervated by sensory neurons. Type Ia sensory neurons 
detect and transmit information about the degree of contraction or stretch that a 
muscle is undergoing. When a muscle spindle is stretched, type Ia axons send 
signals to the spinal cord where they activate alpha motor neurons that then cause 
the muscles to contract. The sensitivity of the reflex is regulated by gamma motor 
neurons, which contract or relax the intrafusal muscle fibers within the spindle.
The kneejerk reflex is a classic example of a stretch reflex. When a doctor taps the 
rubber hammer on your patellar tendon-ligament, it activates a reflex associated 
with the knees buckling while standing, and the lower leg swings outward, which 
keeps you standing, if you weren’t sitting. This reflex contributes to balance, pos￾ture, and rhythmic pattern movement-walking.
Tapping on and deforming the patella tendon-ligament activates the Ia sensory 
neurons in the quadriceps muscle spindle. The Ia sensory neuron sends action 
potentials along its axon to the spinal cord where it branches. It forms one syn￾apse on the alpha motor neuron controlling the quadriceps, an extensor muscle, 
causing it to contract and your lower leg swings forward. This is a monosynaptic 
reflex. Another synapse from the 1a sensory axon, using an inhibitory spinal inter￾neuron, leads to relaxation of the hamstring muscle.
Staying put with the loading reflex
Although you often think of reflexes as producing movement in response to a 
stimulus, some reflexes exist to keep you in the same place. If you were unloading 
a truck and someone tossed you a box and you caught it, the new weight and load 
on your legs would suddenly change. Another example: Pouring water into a glass 
you’re holding increases the load on your arm, but you don’t spill the water.
These responses occur thanks to the loading reflex, whose circuitry is similar to the 
stretch reflex. When a load occurs, the muscle spindle is stretched, the Ia sensory CHAPTER 7 Moving Muscles with Motor Neurons 131
neuron is activated and sends signals to the alpha motor neuron to contract the 
muscle that was stretched. It also signals, through an inhibitory interneuron, for 
the antagonist muscle to relax. This spinal circuit works out the muscle contrac￾tion force necessary to keep you standing when you catch a box or when holding 
your glass when filling it.
Golgi tendon organs
Sensory receptors within the muscle tendons are called Golgi tendon organs. They 
provide feedback about muscle tension, the force of muscle contraction. This pro￾tects muscles from overcontraction for sustained muscle tension and in fine motor 
control.
Golgi tendon organs are located at the junction between the muscle and the ten￾don that attaches to a bone. Golgi tendon organs are innervated by Type Ib sensory 
neurons. This produces an opposite response to the stretch reflex. Activation of 
the Ib axon stimulates an inhibitory interneuron, which inhibits the alpha motor 
neuron, and leads to relaxation of the attached muscle. The antagonist muscle is 
contracted by the Ib axon through an excitatory interneuron.
Joint receptors for position
Somatosensory neurons that innervate muscles, tendons, and joints are called 
proprioceptors. They’re types of mechanoreceptors activated by physical movement 
of the sensory detector region of the neuron. Receptors in joints and tissues 
around joints and nearby skin send information to the spinal cord about joint 
position and movement. Free nerve endings report painful, extreme joint posi￾tions. They let you know when they just don’t bend that way!
Withdrawing a limb in the flexor reflex
The flexor withdrawal reflex is another example of a spinal reflex. Touching 
something sharp or painful can elicit this reflex (see Figure 7-4). The neural cir￾cuit for this reflex exists at the level of the spinal cord and normally happens 
without your conscious control.
The purpose of the flexor withdrawal reflex is to protect you from damaging stim￾uli so you don’t get hurt. It begins by activation of pain receptors (nociceptors) that 
indicate tissue damage. These sensory receptors project to the spinal cord and 
activate flexor muscles that withdraw the limb.132 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Figure 7-4 shows the components of a flexor withdrawal reflex. Touching a sharp 
point activates pain sensory neurons that project to the spinal cord. Pain receptor 
axons form a monosynaptic contact with alpha motor neurons on the same side to 
activate the flexor muscle (biceps) that moves the hand away from the sharp 
point.
The axons also make a disynaptic connection that relaxes the extensor (triceps) 
muscle on the same side. Polysynaptic connections produce arm extension on the 
opposite side. The flexion withdrawal response is also present in the lumbar spi￾nal cord for leg withdrawal when you stub your toe or step on a painful stimulus. 
This fast reflex happens at the spinal level before the pain signal even reaches 
your brain!
Fine, steady control may require partial activation of both muscles simultane￾ously. Fine motor control happens by descending control from the brain acting on 
both alpha motor neurons and spinal interneurons. Other interneurons may proj￾ect to other spinal cord segments, adjusting muscle contractions in your legs to 
balance you when you move your arms.
Overriding a reflex
Although local spinal cord neural circuits carry out the details of cortical brain 
commands, sometimes cortical, high-level commands override the local reflex 
circuits. You can hold on to a hot cup of coffee despite your reflex to let go. You can 
suppress a cough for a short period, but not for too long if a strong irritant is 
present.

Exercise and Aging
Exercise builds muscle mass and strength. Muscles get bigger and stronger in 
response to damage to the muscle fibers from the exercise. Muscle cells can 
increase in size, but new cells aren’t formed when muscles grow. Instead, during 
growth, structural proteins including actin and myosin are added to muscle fibers, 
which increase the cell diameter. The ratio of the numbers of fast- and slow￾twitch fibers in a muscle doesn’t change, but the ratio of the mass of muscle fiber 
types can be altered by different types of exercise.
Lack of activity causes the opposite to happen: Loss of skeletal muscle mass is 
called muscle atrophy. This occurs when astronauts spend months in the low grav￾ity of space. Without the force of gravity to make muscles work, astronauts have 
been known to lose nearly one-quarter of their muscle mass in a few months. 
Muscle atrophy can occur following disuse or denervation through injury or dis￾ease and leads to muscle weakness and disability. The mechanism of muscle atro￾phy involves an imbalance between protein synthesis and protein degradation 
leading to a loss of muscle proteins.  Depending on the duration and extent of 
atrophy, muscles may be restored with activity.
These sections discuss how activity can affect muscles and release muscle hor￾mones and the differences in muscles between males and females.
Use it or lose it: The effects of exercise
Exercise increases the mass of fast-twitch muscle. Endurance training, such as 
long-distance running, can allow people to gain more of the slower Type IIa fibers 
versus the faster Type IIx fibers.
For example, if a person is paralyzed, the ratio of fast-twitch Type II muscle fibers 
to slow-twitch Type I fibers increases. Slow-twitch Type I fibers may be lost 
because of the lack of neural innervation that is necessary to maintain muscle.
Slowing down with age
Without some change in lifestyle, such as taking up weightlifting or strength 
training, most people start losing muscle mass around age 25. By the age of 75, 
individuals are reduced to about half the muscle mass they had before age 25.
During aging, changes also occur in the alpha motor neurons that control mus￾cles. These neurons fire fewer action potentials per second in older versus younger 
people. Declines in both the muscle and neural innervations result in weaker 
muscles that act more slowly.134 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Comparing muscle mass in men 
and women
Developing muscle mass is easier for males because of male hormones, the 
androgens. Even in preschoolers, boys have significantly more muscle mass than 
girls of the same age.
The lower forces that females’ muscles generate may lead to increased joint insta￾bility in athletics, making injuries more likely. For example, damage to the ante￾rior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee is common in female athletes who play 
soccer. Some differences in skeletal composition also put females at a disadvan￾tage compared to males in athletics. Females’ wider pelvises put more stress on 
their knees. Although androgen hormones help males add muscle mass, female 
hormones such as estrogen have little effect on it. Females do have advantages in 
some types of muscle endurance, however.
MYOKINES AND THE BRAIN
During exercise, muscle cells release protein factors into the blood called myokines.
Myokines in the circulation bind to and affect many different tissues, including the liver, 
kidneys, fat tissue, and the brain. They’re proposed to increase metabolism and may 
provide therapeutic effects of exercise in maintaining physical and mental health.
One myokine of interest to neurobiologists is the gene FNDC5 and its protein called 
irisin. The levels of irisin increase following exercise. Though researchers haven’t identi￾fied the mechanism, irisin can cross the blood-brain barrier and has been proposed to 
decrease neuroinflammation and increase neuroplasticity. With these features, irisin is 
an exciting candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and depression.CHAPTER 8 Controlling Movement through Brain Pathways 135
Chapter 8
Controlling Movement 
through Brain Pathways
Your mother said it, and she was right: You’ve got to have goals. The fact is 
that you do because animals, including humans, do things according to 
goals. You may decide you want a better view of some squirrels outside. You 
decide to walk to the window. You decide to move your right foot first. (We didn’t 
say they all needed to be big goals.) Actions start with a hierarchy of goals and 
subgoals, translated into general and particular motor procedures. Where in your 
brain does all this happen?
Goals and decisions arise from activity across many brain circuits. The important 
brain areas for decisions about doing things include the frontal lobes, basal 
ganglia, cerebellum, and thalamus, all of which we discuss in this chapter.

Overviewing Pathways for Controlling 
Movement
Two systems evolved in mammals for brain control of movement, pyramidal 
tracts and extrapyramidal tracts, which we examine in these sections. Both sys￾tems control skeletal muscle contraction. Of course, they need to work together, 
and they do, to produce the variety of movements required for action and behavior 
and also to stay balanced and be coordinated.
Focusing on pyramidal tracts
The pyramidal tracts control voluntary, conscious movement. The two main cate￾gories of pyramidal tracts are the following:
» Corticospinal tract: The corticospinal tract travels from motor cortex through 
the midbrain, pons, pyramids of the medulla, and beyond to synapse on 
neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord to control voluntary movements 
of the limbs and trunk.
» Corticobulbar tract: The corticobulbar tract ends projects from motor cortex 
to neurons in brainstem cranial nerve motor nuclei for the control of volun￾tary movements of the face, mouth, and tongue.
These tracts share common features. In both tracts, the majority of upper motor 
neurons are located in the motor cortex. The upper motor neuron axons travel 
together to form parts of the internal capsule and cerebral peduncles. They syn￾apse on and control both lower motor neurons and nearby interneurons.
Neurons in the motor cortex receive inputs from many brain areas, including the 
prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and 
thalamus. The thalamus relays motor information from the basal ganglia and 
cerebellum.
Eyeing extrapyramidal tracts
The extrapyramidal tracts are primarily for involuntary, unconscious movement. 
The upper motor neurons of the extrapyramidal system originate in the brainstem 
and include the four extrapyramidal tracts. Three of the four tracts exert involun￾tary skeletal muscle control and are involved in posture, balance, muscle tone, 
locomotion, and coordination of movements. The four tracts are as follows:CHAPTER 8 Controlling Movement through Brain Pathways 137
» Reticulospinal: Origin is the reticular formation, a group of nuclei located in 
the pons and medulla. The pontine and medullary reticulospinal tracts are 
responsible primarily for postural control and locomotion.
» Vestibulospinal: Origin is the vestibular nuclei in the pons and medulla. 
Vestibular nuclei receive sensory input about head orientation from the 
vestibular nerve. The vestibulospinal tract can affect muscle tone and 
contributes to posture and maintaining the body’s and head’s balance.
» Tectospinal: Origin is the superior colliculus (tectum) in the midbrain. The 
tectospinal tract coordinates head and eye movements in response to visual 
and auditory sensory stimuli.
» Rubrospinal: Origin is the magnocellular red nucleus in midbrain. The 
rubrospinal tract is involved in voluntary muscle movements and fine motor 
control of the upper limbs.
The upper motor neurons of the extrapyramidal tracts receive their inputs from 
sensory nuclei and cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and motor cortex. We 
describe the location and function of the extrapyramidal tracts in the spinal cord 
in Chapter 9.
Directing Voluntary Movement 
with the Motor Cortex
The motor cortex is located at the posterior end of the frontal lobe in front of the 
central sulcus and consists of three regions:
» Primary motor cortex (M1): This region contains the majority of upper 
motor neurons whose axons form the pyramidal tracts.
In M1, the upper motor neurons are large pyramidal neurons (a common type 
of cortical neuron) called Betz cells and smaller non-Betz cells located in layer 
V. These pyramidal neurons project their axons to the spinal cord forming the 
corticospinal tract or to the brainstem forming the corticobulbar tract. M1 
doesn’t contain granule cells that are typical in the input layer to most neocor￾tex (layer IV) and is called agranular.
» Premotor cortex (PMC) and supplementary motor area (SMA): They’re 
located anterior to M1. Together they’re often referred to as the secondary 
motor cortex. Both the PMC and SMA provide major inputs to M1 and also 
contain some upper motor neurons.138 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Many upper motor neurons synapse directly on alpha lower motor neurons (the 
motor neurons that innervate muscle fibers; refer to Chapter 7) in direct control 
pathways that allow fine, conscious control of muscles. Other upper motor neu￾rons synapse on spinal or brainstem interneurons. These interneurons provide 
input to lower motor neurons and control their output via spinal and brainstem 
circuits.
Mapping the movements: The homunculus
The motor map in M1 is a distorted map of the body’s muscles called a homunculus.
The motor map is similar to the somatosensory map on the other side of the 
central sulcus in the parietal lobe. The corticobulbar tract originates in the 
more lateral regions of M1 while the corticospinal tract originates in the medial 
regions of M1.
The way this map functions suggests that it corresponds not to muscles as they’re 
distributed, but to the movements mediated by those muscles. Single neurons in 
M1 can activate several muscles related to one joint and coordinate muscle activity 
associated with movement of the limb.
The distortion in the homunculus occurs because the size of the cortical represen￾tation of an area is proportional to the fineness of the neural control, not the area 
of the body. For example, the lips and face occupy a greater area of motor cortex 
than the thighs. The control of finger movement involves more than one area.
Recent precision functional imaging studies show that M1 is more complex than 
originally reported in the brain surgery studies. Imaging studies identified several 
areas that don’t appear to control specific muscles. The areas were named the 
somatocognitive action network and may function in goal-oriented action, arousal, 
pain, and physiological control.
Population coding
Neurons in M1 that control the arms are most active when the arms are reaching 
in a specific direction, but they respond for other directions near the preferred 
direction. The average of thousands of these units produces a much tighter direc￾tionality than could be specified by a single neuron via what’s called a population 
code. Individual neurons can be regarded as vectors with a direction where their 
firing is at a maximum, and they fire proportionately less for movements in other 
directions. The average firing of all neurons then controls muscles to move a limb 
in the direction we want to move.CHAPTER 8 Controlling Movement through Brain Pathways 139
Coordinating Muscle Groups
Almost every movement you make involves a sequence of at least dozens of dif￾ferent muscles. Try extending your arm out to the side. This movement is simple 
to do, but it still requires many muscles: Your trunk counterbalances the move￾ment, and your legs muscles stabilize your body.
Although the spinal cord is pretty good at coordinating ordinary movement, evo￾lution hasn’t yet programmed your body to dance the foxtrot or type on the com￾puter. Voluntary movements, especially new ones, require learning organized 
sequences of muscle commands, which involve the SMA and PMC that we discuss 
here, as well as the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which we describe in the sec￾tions “Eyeing the Basal Ganglia and Its Nuclei” and “Correcting Errors: The Cer￾ebellum” later in this chapter.
Guiding with internal goals and the SMA
One way to look at the frontal lobe is that is has an axis of abstraction. The most 
abstract representations of your goals exist in the prefrontal cortex at the most 
anterior part of the frontal lobe. The neurons that control many of your muscles 
are in M1, at the most posterior part of the frontal lobe. In between are the SMA 
and PMC, as well as the frontal eye fields and Broca’s area (refer to the sections 
“Seeing the frontal eye fields and superior colliculus” and “Producing speech: 
Broca’s area” later in this chapter).
The SMA is located just anterior and medial to M1. The PMC is anterior and lateral 
to M1. Both the SMA and PMC are posterior to the prefrontal cortex. Figure 8-1 
shows a diagram of the cerebral cortex (right) with M1 stippled.
FIGURE 8-1:

control circuits.

You can imagine that the prefrontal cortex has the most abstract representation of 
some goal, like getting someone’s attention across the room. You know that you 
could do this in many ways. You could call out, wave, walk over, send someone 
else over, or send a text. Whatever option you choose must be translated into an 
appropriate sequence of commands for the specific muscles.
The prefrontal cortex is where the abstract plans originate. If you’re going to do 
something you know how to do, you activate the SMA. Both the prefrontal cortex 
and SMA communicate with the basal ganglia to choose what you’re going to do. 
The SMA projects to M1 to control exactly which muscles you’re going to use. 
Additional functions attributed to the SMA are postural stabilization and coordi￾nation of both sides of the body.
Functional imaging studies show the SMA is activated even if you just imagine
doing something like moving your arms and legs, without actually doing it.
Externally monitored performance 
and the PMC
When you’re learning to do something new, you need sensory feedback from the 
posterior parietal cortex, which integrates somatosensory, visual, and auditory 
inputs. You also need feedback from the cerebellum, which monitors errors and 
learns timing sequences. When doing unfamiliar tasks, the input to M1 comes 
more from the PMC, which receives information from the posterior parietal cortex 
and cerebellum.
Besides projecting to M1, the PMC also projects directly to the spinal cord and has 
reciprocal connections with the SMA.  The PMC has a distinctive histological 
appearance — it has a granular layer IV that’s distinct from the agranular M1.
Setting Goals with the Prefrontal Cortex
The frontal lobes are the center of goal pursuit. The SMA and PMC areas organize 
and sequence groups of muscles to accomplish movement goals, such as running 
while bringing your tennis racquet back in readiness to stop and hit a forehand.
Anterior to SMA and PMC are two regions called the frontal eye fields, which are 
involved in visual attention, and Broca’s area, which is involved in language. 
Everything anterior to these areas is called the prefrontal cortex. The frontal 
lobes constitute about one-third of the neocortex, and more than half of the 
frontal lobes consist of the prefrontal cortex. The following sections explore what CHAPTER 8 Controlling Movement through Brain Pathways 141
goes on in the prefrontal cortex, Broca’s area, and the cortical area called the 
cingulate cortex.
Planning with the lateral prefrontal cortex
In human brain anatomy, the prefrontal cortex can be divided into four main 
regions: dorsolateral, ventrolateral, dorsomedial, and orbitofrontal (also called 
ventromedial).
These regions have both overlapping and specific functions. For this discussion, 
we group the dorsolateral and ventrolateral regions together and refer to it as the 
lateral prefrontal cortex.
The lateral prefrontal cortex is the maker of plans. Say it’s the first day of fall and 
you decide you need a warmer coat. You need to make plans that include checking 
your budget, going to a store, and going to the right part of the store. You could 
accomplish all these things in many ways, and you’ll find many distractions 
around every action you take. Your lateral prefrontal cortex processes sensory 
experience in light of your goals and subgoals to direct your behavior. In order to 
do this, it has to maintain a representation of your goals and interpret what’s 
going on around you in light of those goals.
Neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex receive projections from nearly the entire 
rest of the brain. And these neurons feed back to the neurons that activate them. 
In the case of the coat you need, you may decide to buy a packable down coat for 
less than $130. Your prefrontal cortex maintains a resonant circuit in which the 
neural representations of these attributes in other parts of the brain remain 
mutually active. When you get to the store, you inhibit yourself from looking at 
wool coats or coats costing more than $130.
Your behavior, including all your movements, is controlled by the set of goals 
represented in your prefrontal cortex. When this brain area is damaged, behavior 
becomes stimulus driven, not dependent on internal goals.
Processing emotions with the 
orbitofrontal cortex
Many of a person’s plans and beliefs are rational and calculated. You may pur￾chase a coat that you can afford and that will keep you warm. Any number of coats 
may satisfy this need equally. But you have other beliefs and behaviors that elicit 
strong emotions: Your love for your spouse or children moves you to take life￾threatening risks for them. You’re revolted when you witness animal cruelty. 
You’re nervous when driving in rush-hour traffic.142 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
The orbitofrontal cortex is the most ventral and anterior part of the prefrontal cor￾tex. It’s extensively connected to the amygdala, which is involved in memory for 
emotionally important events.
Damage to the orbitofrontal-amygdala system can result in sociopathic behavior 
in which the person is unable to feel empathy. It can also result in reckless behav￾ior, such as excessive gambling, because the affected person doesn’t have the 
normal fear associated with placing large, financially dangerous wagers.
Producing speech: Broca’s area
Broca’s area is located posterior and lateral to the prefrontal cortex on the left side 
of the brain in the majority of people. This frontal lobe region is a key component 
of a complex speech network. It receives sensory information from the temporal 
cortex. Broca’s area then formulates a plan for speaking and transmits that plan 
to the motor cortex to control the movements of the mouth for speech articula￾tion. It has also been implicated in speech-associated body gestures and in some 
aspects of speech comprehension.
Processing with the cingulate cortex
The cingulate cortex is a sheet of older cortex called mesocortex lying just above the 
corpus callosum and below the neocortex. The division between the anterior 
and posterior cingulate is about at the location of the central sulcus. Here’s what 
each does:
» Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC): The most dorsal portion (toward the front 
of the brain) of the ACC has reciprocal connections to prefrontal, motor, and 
parietal cortices. It’s believed to be an executive controller that allocates 
processing priority among the connected brain areas. The ventral ACC has 
connections with the amygdala, insular cortex, hypothalamus, and nucleus 
accumbens. The ventral ACC is involved in processing emotional stimuli.
A fascinating finding from human functional imaging is that the ACC is 
activated while performing difficult or confusing tasks.
» The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC): The area implicated in pain awareness 
and episodic memory. It’s connected to the prefrontal cortex and the parahip￾pocampal gyrus (which communicates with the entorhinal cortex, the input 
region for the hippocampus). The PCC is thought to be a crucial area in the 
default mode network of the brain. This network is active when a person is 
not concentrating on a specific task.
You will find out more about the frontal lobes in Chapter 11.CHAPTER 8 Controlling Movement through Brain Pathways 143
Selecting with the Basal Ganglia
The basal ganglia originate in the first vertebrates. Below the basal ganglia are the 
brainstem and spinal cord. These structures are adequate to control basic locomo￾tion and regulate body processes for homeostasis. But somewhere decisions have 
to be made about what gait is to be used, in what direction. The basal ganglia are 
the original decision locus for overall behaviors. In mammalian evolution, the 
neocortex gave the basal ganglia many more behavioral options from which to 
choose.
Although the operation of the basal ganglia and related nuclei aren’t well under￾stood, it’s clear that the basal ganglia are involved in the selection of specific 
actions. The prefrontal cortex provides goals and the senses provide information 
about the internal and external world. The job of the basal ganglia is to choose the 
specific movements, given all the possibilities, at many stages in action execution, 
to achieve the overall goal.
The basal ganglia nuclei include the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus 
pallidus. Always discussed with these three nuclei are the subthalamic nucleus 
(STN), a part of the subthalamus, and the two substantia nigra nuclei, which are 
in the midbrain. Figure 8-2 shows these nuclei. The globus pallidus is divided into 
internal and external segments. The input regions to the basal ganglia are the 
caudate and putamen, which together is called the striatum. The output of the basal 
ganglia is mainly from the internal segment of the globus pallidus and also the 
substantia nigra.
FIGURE 8-2:

section showing 
basal ganglia. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.144 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
The basal ganglia are involved in initiating and controlling movement through 
connections to the cerebral cortex and extrapyramidal system. Both the basal 
ganglia and motor cortex also interact with the cerebellum, an ancient motor 
sequence coordination center. The following section looks at the organization of 
the basal ganglia nuclei.
Flowing into and out of the basal ganglia
The basal ganglia interact with the thalamus and cortex in a brain circuit, part of 
which you can see in Figure 8-3. Excitatory (glutamate) connections are black, 
and inhibitory (GABA) connections are gray. Cognitive (prefrontal), motor, and 
sensory cortical areas send excitatory inputs to the striatum. The striatum inhibits 
the globus pallidus external segment (GPe), globus pallidus internal segment 
(GPi), and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). GPe inhibits STN. STN excites 
GPe and GPi/SNr. The output of the basal ganglia, GPi/SNr inhibits the thalamus, 
which itself excites the frontal cortex. The net effect of all this is that the inputs 
to the thalamus that are not inhibited by the basal ganglia are the ones that acti￾vate the motor cortex.
Working inside basal ganglia circuits
The basal ganglia receive inputs in the outer nuclei (striatum), which project to 
the inner nuclei (globus pallidus). The output of the basal ganglia is chiefly from 
these inner nuclei to the thalamus, and it’s primarily inhibitory.
FIGURE 8-3:
Organization of 
the basal ganglia. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.CHAPTER 8 Controlling Movement through Brain Pathways 145
Projections from the striatum give rise to two main pathways within the basal 
ganglia:
» The direct pathway is the inhibitory projection from striatum to the GPi/SNr 
complex, which itself inhibits the thalamus. Because inhibiting an inhibition 
results in disinhibition, the net effect of the direct pathway is excitatory to the 
thalamus. The thalamus projects to the motor cortex to stimulate the output 
for the pyramidal tracts.
» The indirect pathway consists of neurons in the striatum projecting to the 
external segment of the GPe, which inhibits the STN. This is a disinhibition of 
the STN. The STN excites the GPi/SNr complex, which inhibits the thalamus. 
This opposes the direct pathway and reduces activation of the motor cortex.
Both the direct and indirect pathways are modulated by the substantia nigra pars 
compacta (SNc), which uses the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine release by 
the SNc amplifies activity in the direct pathway, increasing cortical activation of 
movement. Dopamine released by the SNc also affects the indirect pathway inhi￾bition. The reduction of dopamine release in the case of Parkinson’s disease causes 
people to lose their ability to initiate movement because of both lowered activity 
of the direct pathway and reduced inhibition of the indirect pathway.
The basal ganglia are involved in a type of implicit memory called procedural mem￾ory. It’s responsible for processing and coordinating the muscle movements and 
habitual actions required to achieve a skill and goal. Synaptic plasticity, consid￾ered to be an important mechanism underlying the encoding of memory, has been 
demonstrated in the stratum during procedural tasks.
Correcting Errors and Motor Learning: 
The Cerebellum
The cerebellum (Latin for “little brain”) is a part of the brain that plays an impor￾tant role in motor coordination, precision, and timing. It’s capable of learning 
motor sequences and generating error signals when body movement doesn’t 
match the brain’s commands. The cerebellum receives inputs from sensory neu￾rons of the spinal cord and brainstem and integrates these with inputs from sen￾sory, motor, and cognitive cortical regions to fine-tune motor activity.
The cerebellum juts out from the back of the brainstem. It sits just below the pos￾terior part of the cortex (see Figure 8-4). The cerebellum evolved in vertebrates 
and is a highly complex brain structure. Like the newer neocortex that evolved in 
mammals, the cerebellum is a thin, large area neural layer that’s folded up to fit 146 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
in a small space. The cerebellum is necessary for several types of motor learning 
as the following sections discuss. Most notably, it adjusts relationships between 
sensory and motor functions for coordination.
The cerebellum is evolutionarily old. It has a similar form in both mammals and 
nonmammalian vertebrates such as fish and amphibians. It’s also complex and 
contains as many neurons as all the rest of the brain. Cerebellar lesions result in 
decreased muscle tone, clumsy and abnormal movements, and loss of balance.
Dividing functions in the cerebellum
The cerebellum receives somatosensory information from the entire body via the 
spinal cord, vestibular and visual information from the brain, and a copy of motor 
plans from the motor cortex. These inputs synapse in the outer superficial layers 
of the cerebellum, called the cerebellar cortex. After processing in the cerebellar 
cortex, the Purkinje neurons project to deep cerebellar nuclei that are the main 
output of the cerebellum. The control output of the cerebellum is ipsilateral (on the 
same side of the body) because input and outputs both cross the midline.
The cerebellum has three main divisions, which you can see in Figure 8-5:
» The cerebrocerebellum is the most lateral part of the cerebellum. Another 
name is the neocerebellum. Its inputs are sensory, cognitive, and motor 
planning information from the cerebral cortex, and it projects to the red 
FIGURE 8-4:
The cerebellum. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.CHAPTER 8 Controlling Movement through Brain Pathways 147
nucleus and the ventrolateral thalamus, which in turn projects to the motor 
cortex. The cerebellum uses the previous experience of similar movement 
sequences to refine these plans.
» The spinocerebellum is in the midline, comprising the vermis and paravermis.
It receives proprioceptive and auditory inputs and projects to deep cerebellar 
nuclei called the fastigeal and interposed nuclei, which in turn project to the 
brainstem and motor cortex. This is a lower level of control than that medi￾ated by the cerebrocerebellum and is more concerned with finer details and 
coordination of movements and muscle tone.
» The vestibulocerebellum receives inputs from the vestibular nuclei, semicir￾cular canals, superior colliculus, and visual cortex. It projects into the oculo￾motor system to adjust eye movements and into vestibular recipient zones 
for correction of balance mechanisms.
Stepping in holes and what to do about it
The cerebellum compares what the brain commands the body to do with what the 
body does. It receives commands from the motor cortex about where the body is 
supposed to be and uses sensory feedback to recognize where the body actually is 
and what it’s doing. The cerebellum recognizes any errors and sends program￾ming information back to the motor cortex through the thalamus to change the 
command sequence to correct the errors.
FIGURE 8-5:
Divisions of the 
cerebellum. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.148 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
The spinocerebellum and cerebrocerebellum generate different kinds of responses 
to errors:
» At the lower level, the spinocerebellum may adjust your body posture and 
immediate stride when you’re running on uneven ground with bumps 
and holes.
» At a higher level, the cerebrocerebellum may cause you to change your gait 
and slow down if you’re heading for a tree.
One reason that you get better at doing things with practice — like hitting a tennis 
ball — is that your cerebellum learns which motor sequences work and which 
don’t. This type of learning is called procedural or motor learning. You aren’t con￾scious of motor learning, but it’s essential for doing all skilled action. The cere￾bellum has a set of learning circuits in its cortex that carry out this adaptive 
behavior. Damage to the cerebellum doesn’t cause paralysis because your basic 
motor command and execution structure is intact. However, it does result in dis￾orders in fine movement, posture equilibrium, and future motor learning.
Carrying the load: Feed-forward 
force calibration
In short-distance circuits, like those involved in spinal reflexes, feedback control 
is fast enough to do what it’s supposed to do. In feedback control, a neural com￾parator constantly evaluates the difference between the command position and 
the actual position and sends error-correcting commands to the appropriate 
muscles to reduce the error to zero. But in long, complex circuits, like from the 
brain to the extremities, feedback circuits may be too slow to work efficiently.
For these command circuits to work properly, timing is very important. For exam￾ple, adjusting the extensor force in a leg won’t do any good if the gait has already 
shifted the weight to the other leg. Or consider a simple act like throwing a base￾ball: It involves a learned preparation phase of positioning the legs, rotating the 
shoulders, and holding the ball out and away from the body. Then the throw itself 
consists of a sequence of rapidly executed plans for moving the leg, rotating the 
shoulder, moving both the upper and lower arm in synchrony, and releasing the 
grip on the ball at the right moment. Timing is everything if you’re going to throw 
a strike. And timing has to be programmed in advance.
The cerebellum also acts as a feed-forward control system in contrast (and com￾plementary) to the spinal cord feedback system. In the cerebellar feed-forward sys￾tem, the cerebellum receives sensory information during movement with which it CHAPTER 8 Controlling Movement through Brain Pathways 149
produces a model that can generate an optimal sequence of output commands in 
the future. Feed-forward systems learn (by practice) the correct sequence of com￾mands to program a task — like throwing a ball — without having to rely on long 
feedback loops to correct for errors.
Imagine a thermostat. Suppose it’s controlling the temperature in a nuclear power 
plant, which takes a long time to heat up or cool down. When the thermostat trips 
at the desired temperature, the plant will still keep running for some time and 
overheat. But in a feed-forward system, the controller (cerebellum) would learn 
how long it takes to shut down the plant and program the thermostat to turn off 
at the exact right time before the temperature could reach its set point.
Responding through cerebellar circuits
During movement, motor command and sensory status information come into the 
outer layers of the cerebellum. In the outer layers, a highly regular set of neural 
circuits — that include several prominent cell types, such as Purkinje and granule 
cells — process the information. The folded cerebellar cortex provides considera￾ble area for these circuits. After processing, these circuits project to a set of deep 
cerebellar nuclei, which are the cerebellar output.
In the cerebellar cortex, each cerebellar Purkinje cell receives inputs from thou￾sands of what are called parallel fibers, which are the axons of granule cells, but 
only from one climbing fiber, which is one of the external inputs. The other exter￾nal input is via what are called mossy fibers. Both Purkinje cells and mossy fibers 
project to the deep cerebellar nuclei.
The parallel fibers can be regarded as a matrix of different timings of one muscle’s 
action during a sequence. The single climbing fiber provides the signals that 
induce long-lasting changes in the strength of the appropriate parallel fiber 
inputs. In other words, if you throw the ball too low, the next time the cerebellum 
will program for you to release the ball slightly earlier (or program some other 
adjustment to raise the ball’s trajectory).
Recent imaging studies show that motor learning in the cerebellum underlies 
some cognitive activities that were thought to be quite abstract, such as playing 
chess. When experienced chess players are contemplating game moves, their cere￾bella are activated, suggesting that movement sequences in chess are represented 
in the cerebellum. The cerebellum may also be involved in higher cognitive func￾tions such as language and social cognition.150 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
The Thalamus: Gateway to the Neocortex
The thalamus, a major part of the diencephalon, is the motor and sensory gateway 
to the neocortex. The following sections look at the ways in which different types 
of motor input relay through the thalamus. Chapters 13 and 14 describe the tha￾lamic sensory relay.
Moving through motor pathways
The ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei of the thalamus make up its motor 
portion. The ventral lateral nucleus receives motor information from the globus 
pallidus internal segment of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra pars reticu￾lata, and the cerebellum. The ventral lateral nucleus projects to the motor cortex 
and the premotor cortex.
The motor portion of the thalamus projects information to the motor cortex for 
coordination, as well as planning and learning movements.
Paying attention to the pulvinar
The pulvinar is a set of nuclei in the most posterior region of each thalamus. The 
subdivisions are medial, lateral, anterior, and inferior, each of which consists of 
several nuclei.
The superior colliculus projects to medial, lateral, and inferior pulvinar subdivi￾sions and appears to be involved in mediating the focus of attention in the visual 
system and in controlling eye movements to prominent locations. These areas 
have extensive reciprocal connections with early visual cortical areas. For exam￾ple, the dorsolateral pulvinar interacts with posterior parietal cortex (the “where” 
or “how to” dorsal visual pathway). Medial pulvinar nuclei have extensive con￾nections with premotor and prefrontal cortical areas, cingulate cortex, and poste￾rior parietal cortex.
The pulvinar is larger and more extensively connected in humans compared to 
other mammals. It constitutes about 40 percent of the thalamus in humans, but 
it’s almost nonexistent in rodents and many other mammals. Pulvinar lesions in 
humans cause visual attention deficits.
Modulating with thalamic reticular areas
The reticular formation that begins in the brainstem extends to the thalamus. The 
brain has a thalamic reticular nucleus, but reticular areas typically surround nuclei 
or extend into intralaminar zones. Neurons in the reticular areas are mostly CHAPTER 8 Controlling Movement through Brain Pathways 151
GABAergic (use the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA), and they work to modulate 
or gate functions on the nearby areas. They’re almost exclusively interneurons 
that don’t project out of the thalamus.
The thalamic reticular areas receive afferent (inward) input from the brainstem 
reticular formation and cortex and project to various thalamic nuclei within the 
thalamus to regulate the flow of information through these to the cortex. The cor￾tical input tends to select ascending inputs according to what is most salient or 
prominent within a sense, whereas the brainstem reticular input tends to switch 
attention between senses according to threats and immediate contingencies.
Seeing the frontal eye fields 
and superior colliculus
Anterior to the SMA is a cortical area called the frontal eye fields (FEFs). The FEFs 
are involved in visual attention and initiating eye movements (voluntary 
saccades), which are the rapid movements your eyes make when going from one 
point to another, such as when you’re reading.
The FEF receive visual inputs in a pathway that starts with the retinal projection 
to the superior colliculus, which projects to the medial dorsal nucleus of the thal￾amus, and then to the FEF cortex. The FEF contains a map that represents eye 
movement saccade targets. When neurons in the FEF are electrically stimulated, 
the eyes move to and look at areas of visual space that correspond to the stimula￾tion point.
The superior colliculus is a midbrain nucleus that receives projections from nearly 
all retinal ganglion cells, except parvocellular ganglion cells. In nonmammalian 
vertebrates, this structure is the main visual processing center, but in mammals it 
appears to mostly code for eye movements. Electrical stimulation of the superior 
colliculus, like the FEF, produces saccadic eye movements according to a well￾defined map across its surface.
Knowing, or Not Knowing, 
Who’s In Control
This chapter explains that involuntary motor activity is controlled by the extrapy￾ramidal tracts that originate in the brainstem. These are, in turn, modulated by 
the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and sensory and motor areas of the cerebral cortex. 
These pathways are involved in reflexes, locomotion, posture, and balance.152 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
The chapter also describes how voluntary motor activity is controlled by neurons 
in M1, which directly and indirectly activate alpha motor neurons. Neurons in M1 
are modulated by the SMA or PMC. Both of these motor areas receive inputs from 
the prefrontal cortex, sensory cortices and the thalamus, which relays informa￾tion from the basal ganglia and cerebellum about selection, sequence and correc￾tion of actions.
So, who’s in charge? Well, it depends on the circumstances. If you trip while walk￾ing, the extrapyramidal system may control your arms, legs, and trunk. If you’re 
trying to hit a high backhand tennis shot that you rarely practice, you may depend 
on your PMC. Turning the knob and opening the door to your house — which you 
do every day — probably mostly activates your SMA.
But you may feel that you perform some movements entirely voluntarily, decided 
by the real you somewhere in the brain, like deciding to get up and get some ice 
cream from the freezer. Certainly you’re aware of this thought stirring you to 
action. But maybe the thought existed before you were aware of it? Perhaps you 
were slightly hungry, but you hadn’t clued in yet. Perhaps a sound you heard or 
something you saw had an association with eating ice cream that you had forgot￾ten. Your blood sugar may be low, or some unconscious brain activity may have 
re-created the fact that you bought a new ice cream flavor yesterday but hadn’t 
remembered until now.
Cold-blooded vertebrates that have basal ganglia but little or no neocortex have a 
limited repertoire of complex behaviors that generally don’t depend much on 
learning. Mammals in general, primates in particular, and humans specifically 
have a large number of complex behaviors, and they learn new ones throughout 
their lifetimes. Nevertheless, the selection among these behaviors remains 
embedded in old neural circuits, including the basal ganglia, but now within com￾plex memories and hierarchical goal systems.
The control system is hierarchical and distributed, but only one motor program 
can control the muscles at a time. You can’t hit a forehand and a backhand at the 
same time — you have to choose. You’re aware of the choice, certainly, but not 
everything that may have gone into it.CHAPTER 9 Focusing On the Spinal Cord and Brain Stem 153
Chapter 9
Focusing On the Spinal 
Cord and Brain Stem
Although the forebrain usually gets credit for being the smart one, the 
spinal cord and brainstem are pretty intelligent too. The forebrain is 
the architect, whereas the spine and brainstem are the contractors. The 
forebrain, using its vision, memory, and goals, decides where you want to go or 
what you want to say, like an architect decides the design of the building. But the 
spinal cord and brainstem, the contractors, execute the plans, considering a ton of 
variables, while also letting the forebrain know what’s going on outside and keep￾ing things going inside.
This chapter focuses on the two of the oldest parts of the central nervous system 
(CNS) that evolved in vertebrates, the spinal cord and brain stem. They share 
important functions: 
» Both contain pathways for signals traveling between the brain and the rest 
of the body.
» Both contain lower motor neurons that control voluntary movements and 
autonomic functions.
» Both relay sensory information from the body to the thalamus.
» Both function as complex computers to control motor output and generate 
important reflexes.

nerves

and reflexes
» Getting a sense of the peripheral 
nervous system
» Functioning with the brain stem154 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
» The spinal cord also produces the central pattern generator to control 
locomotion, while the brainstem generates survival and homeostatic 
functions.
Surveying the Spinal Cord
The brain and spinal cord comprise the CNS. The spinal cord begins at the bottom 
of the brainstem, below the medulla. It begins with cervical segments and then 
proceeds to thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal segments. The next sections 
focus on the spinal cord.
Protecting the spinal cord
The spinal cord is embedded in and protected by the vertebral column, composed 
of vertebrae — a series of small bones that form the spine, shown in Figure 9-1. 
The backbone is a set of spinal vertebrae that run from the neck to the tail bone, a 
remnant of humans’ pre-ape lineage.
FIGURE 9-1:

The spinal cord lies between the main vertebra bodies and the bones of the back 
that you can feel through your skin. Between the vertebra bodies are spinal disks,
which are pads made of connective tissue that cushion and separate the vertebra 
bodies. A herniated disk is a common back injury.
The spinal cord is also protected by the same three layers that cover the brain, 
called the meninges:
» Dura mater: The outer membrane containing connective tissue that protects 
the spinal cord
» Arachnoid mater: The layer under the dura mater consisting of web-like 
membrane extensions that surround the subarachnoid space filled with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
» Pia mater: The inner layer, a thin membrane that covers the entire 
spinal cord
The meninges surround the groups of neurons, glia, and tracts that form the 
spinal cord along its length.
Examining the gray and white matter
Looking at the spinal cord reveals the central gray matter area that contains neu￾rons, surrounded by white matter composed of axonal tracts. The gray matter is 
shaped like a butterfly and consists of neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and syn￾apses. The white matter axon tracts transmit motor information down the spinal 
cord to the segments and sensory information up to the brain.
The spinal cord gray matter is separated into functional regions called horns:
» Dorsal horn: This horn contains sensory relay neurons. Both somatic and 
visceral primary sensory neurons send sensory information to the 
dorsal horn.
» Ventral horn: This horn contains somatic lower motor neurons.
» Lateral horn: This horn contains autonomic lower motor neurons.
All of the gray matter regions also contain spinal interneurons. Figure 9-2 shows 
a schematic section of the spinal cord.156 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
In the center of the gray area is the central canal. It’s continuous with the fourth 
ventricle in the medulla and contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF has several 
functions (refer to Chapter  1) including nourishing and cushioning the spinal 
cord. Because of the continuity between the spinal cord and brain CSF, anesthetics 
can be injected between L3 and L5 into the spinal cord and will reach the brain.
Inputting and outputting
Inputs into and outputs from the spinal cord are anatomically separated. Both 
somatic and visceral sensory axon inputs always enter into the spinal cord through 
the dorsal side (toward the back of the human body) at the dorsal root. Both 
somatic and autonomic motor axon outputs from the spinal cord always exit from 
the ventral side (toward the front of the human body) via the ventral root.
Coming in the back
Just outside the spinal cord on the dorsal side are the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The 
DRG contain the cell bodies of primary sensory neurons whose axon branches 
project to the periphery and into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. DRG contain 
both primary somatosensory neurons that innervate skin, muscles and joints and 
primary visceral sensory neurons that innervate internal organs.
As Figure 9-2 shows, a single axon emerges from the sensory neuron body in the 
DRG and then bifurcates (splits itself into two) within the ganglion. One axon 
branch extends to the periphery to its target. DRG neurons don’t have dendrites or 
form synapses at their sensory endings. Instead, sensory input (such as mechani￾cal stimulation) produces action potentials in the axon terminal at the target 
(such as the skin).
FIGURE 9-2:

matter inside the 
spinal cord.

These action potentials travel along the axon toward the DRG and then along the 
other axon branch into the spinal cord dorsal horn. In the spinal cord, the sensory 
axons form conventional synapses, releasing the neurotransmitter glutamate 
onto sensory relay neurons and spinal interneurons.
DRG neurons can participate in monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes (refer to 
Chapter 7). They also send both somatic and visceral sensory information about 
the body to the brain along ascending white matter tracts in the spinal cord.
Going out the front
The output axons from motor neurons form the ventral root that exits from the 
ventral side of the spinal cord. Motor neurons are located in two regions of the 
spinal gray matter. Somatic motor output is from alpha and gamma lower motor 
neurons whose cell bodies are located in the ventral gray area. Their axons project 
to the motor end plate regions and spindles in skeletal muscles.
The cell bodies of autonomic motor neurons, called preganglionic neurons, are 
located in the lateral horn. They extend axons to postganglionic neurons in auto￾nomic ganglia outside the spinal cord. Postganglionic neurons project axons to 
internal organs and tissues to mediate autonomic responses. All sympathetic and a 
few parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are located in the spinal cord (refer to 
Chapter 10). The majority of preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are located in 
the brainstem (refer to the section “Noting essential nuclei” later in this chapter).
Joining together to form spinal nerves
Dorsal root and ventral root axons enter or leave the spinal cord in each segment 
through several smaller bundles called rootlets that join together on the distal side 
of the dorsal root ganglion. Spinal nerves contain both somatic sensory and 
somatic motor axons. In addition, in some nerves, autonomic motor and visceral 
sensory axons are present as well. Sensory axons traveling toward the spinal cord 
are called afferents while the motor axons transmitting signals away from the spi￾nal cord are called efferents.
The interior of the spinal cord is part of the CNS, but the axons projecting outside 
the spinal cord are part of the peripheral nervous system. All the spinal nerves 
distal to the dorsal root ganglia consist of both sensory and motor axons, so 
they’re called mixed nerves.
The human spinal cord consists of 31 segments with each giving rise to a spinal 
nerve. The spinal nerves exit directly from the spinal cord in the upper segments 
of the vertebral column. In the lower vertebrae, the nerves typically travel a seg￾ment or two down the column before exiting. Below the spinal cord are additional 
fused vertebrae called spinal coccygeal segments, which aren’t associated with spi￾nal nerves.158 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Figure 9-3 shows where the segments are located along the spine as well as their 
functions. Many nerves exiting the spinal cord can form a plexus, which is a net￾work of nerves. The two major nerve plexuses are the  brachial plexus, which 
emerges from the cervical spine, and the lumbosacral plexus, which emerges from 
the lumbosacral spine.
FIGURE 9-3:

segments and 
some of their 
functions.

Injury to the spinal cord can result in partial paralysis or severe disability. The 
extent of disability depends on the extent of the injury and the location of the seg￾ment of the spinal cord where damage occurs.
Noting the spinal nerves
The top of the spinal cord starts where the medulla ends. The first seven vertebral 
segments are called cervical. From this region, eight cervical cord segments are 
present, and eight pairs of cervical nerves (C1 to C8) exit to innervate the periphery.
The nerves leaving the various spinal segments are, in many cases, similar to 
nerves leaving the brainstem, where they’re called cranial nerves. We discuss the 
cranial nerves in the section “Moving and Surviving with the Brainstem” later in 
this chapter.
The spinal cord has eight cervical segments with eight spinal nerves, but the spine 
has only seven cervical vertebrae segments. Nerves C1 to C7 exit the spinal cord 
from just above their corresponding vertebra. However, starting at the C7 to T1 
(for thoracic 1) junction, the spinal nerve roots exit below their corresponding 
vertebra. The spinal nerve emanating from between C7 and T1 is called C8. Here is 
the lowdown on the different spinal nerves and their functions.
Cervical nerves
Cervical nerves C1 and C2 control head position via neck muscles. Nerves C3 and 
C4 control the diaphragm for breathing. Nerve C5 controls upper arm muscles, 
such as the biceps and deltoids. Nerve C6 controls the wrist and provides a partial 
innervation of the biceps. Nerve C7 controls the triceps. Nerve C8 controls the 
hands. Each cervical nerve also receives sensory information from the same area 
it controls.
Thoracic nerves
For the thoracic nerves, T1 projects into the brachial plexus that innervates the 
arms and upper back. T2 to T6 project to the intercostal muscles and receive sen￾sory information from the skin of the chest and upper back. T7 to T11 innervate 
the skin and intercostal muscles of the abdomen and lower back. T12 projects with 
the iliohypogastric nerve (a branch of L1) to innervate the gluteus muscles and skin 
of the buttocks. All the thoracic segments contain sympathetic preganglionic neu￾rons that innervate the internal organs.160 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Lumbar nerves
From the five vertebrae in the lower back emerge five pairs of lumbar spinal 
nerves. These nerves innervate the lower abdomen, back, and buttocks. L1 through 
L4 innervate the thigh muscles, such as the quadratus lumborum and iliopsoas for 
flexion. L2 through L5 mediate thigh adduction. Segments L1 through L3 give rise 
to preganglionic sympathetic neurons.
Sacral and coccygeal nerves
The sacral nerves (S1 to S5) and coccygeal nerve emerge from the spinal cord 
through openings called foramen in the fused sacral vertebrae. The nerves join 
either the sacral or lumbosacral plexus. Sacral and coccygeal nerve functions 
include innervation of the skin and muscles of the thighs, buttocks, legs, and feet. 
S2 through S4 contain preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that innervate the 
colon, rectum, bladder, and genital organs.
Moving around: Input and effectors
The spinal cord controls the trunk and limbs to act in unison with motor com￾mands from the brain arriving via the descending spinal cord tracts. Axons in 
these tracts innervate alpha motor neurons and spinal interneurons to control the 
motor output. Sensory input to the cord is provided by primary sensory neurons 
and received by sensory relay neurons and spinal interneurons. Sensory input is 
relayed to the brain along ascending tracts and also in spinal circuits. The spinal 
cord neural circuitry integrates motor and sensory input to control motor output 
through reflex arcs. In addition, sensory and motor circuits coordinate multiple 
segments of the spine.
Here are the inputs to and circuitry within the spinal cord:
» Commands from the motor cortex: Upper motor neurons in the motor cortex 
project axons to spinal cord alpha motor neurons and spinal interneurons via 
the corticospinal tracts. They control voluntary limb and trunk movements.
» Commands from the brainstem: Upper motor neurons in brainstem nuclei 
project to alpha motor neurons and spinal interneurons via extrapyramidal 
tracts: vestibulospinal, reticulospinal, and tectospinal tracts. They provide 
involuntary muscle control for posture, balance, and head movements. The 
fourth is the rubrospinal tract that provides minor voluntary control of upper 
limb movement.
» Monosynaptic and polysynaptic activation by sensory receptors: This 
activation occurs in reflex arcs involving primary sensory neurons that 
innervate skin, muscles, and joints. Pain-withdrawal and kneejerk reflexes 
both involve synaptic connections from the sensory to the motor units.CHAPTER 9 Focusing On the Spinal Cord and Brain Stem 161
» Polysynaptic activation in multi-muscle coordination: Alpha motor 
neurons receive substantial input from nearby and distant spinal interneu￾rons. These interneuron circuits are involved in locomotion and complex, 
multi-muscle coordination, and reflexes.
Reflecting on the basic spinal reflex
Spinal reflexes are rapid responses that don’t require brain input or awareness. In 
Chapter 7, we explain that a reflex is the basic unit of sensory motor integration. 
In spinal reflexes, a stimulus (such as to a pain receptor on the finger or stretch of 
a muscle) leads to a direct movement (such as withdrawing the finger or contrac￾tion of that muscle).
Primary somatosensory neurons extend their axons into the spinal cord where 
they branch. One branch synapses on a secondary sensory (relay) neuron to relay 
sensation. The other branch may synapse on an alpha motor neuron or on a spinal 
interneuron that provides input to an alpha motor neuron. Sensory information 
from the skin, muscles, and joints provides input for both conscious sensation and 
rapid reflex responses for posture and balance or to protect limbs from injury.
The inputs to and outputs from the majority of spinal interneurons occur within a 
single spinal cord segment. A few spinal interneurons, called propriospinal inter￾neurons, project to other segments and are important for coordinating move￾ments and locomotion.
Focusing on spinal central 
pattern generators
Early in the 20th century, research showed that animals could walk and run on 
treadmills even if the spinal cord connections to their brains were severed. This 
means that the spinal cord can produce basic rhythmic patterns for locomotion 
without the need for any descending commands from the cortex. The spinal cord 
neuronal circuits that produce rhythmic patterns of neural activity are called cen￾tral pattern generators (CPGs).
CPGs normally produce rhythmic patterned outputs in response to sensory feed￾back; however, sensory feedback isn’t required for CPGs to produce these outputs. 
Sensory feedback helps coordinate efficient locomotion in the limbs, for instance. 
The brain normally initiates and controls the activity of spinal CPGs through 
descending axonal projections that make up high-level commands, such as 
changing your gait.162 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Locomoting with alternate limb movement
Walking and other forms of locomotion involve moving all four limbs. CPGs are 
distributed throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. These circuits 
generate motor neuron firing patterns that synchronize rhythmic contractions of 
flexor-extensor muscles of the arms and legs. As the legs move in antiphase with 
each other, the arms move in the opposite antiphase — so your left arm goes for￾ward at the same time as your right leg.
Balance is mediated by having lumbar pattern generators affect pattern genera￾tors in cervical segments. It’s also subject to top-down control from inputs from 
the visual and vestibular (your sense of balance) systems. Your visual system gen￾erates commands to keep you from running into trees. Your vestibular system 
prevents you from falling if you step in a hole and allows you to run on a slope.
CPGs require neural circuits that interact in such a way that half of the circuit 
increases in activity while the other half decreases. Scientists believe this alter￾nating phase activity is based on what are called half-center oscillators. In a reci￾procal network, two groups of neurons reciprocally inhibit each other, which is a 
core feature of many CPGs.
Changing pace, walking, and running
Our immediate needs for balance and central commands to change gaits — such 
as from walking to running — modulate CPGs. Virtually all gaits involve alternat￾ing lower limbs, and simultaneously alternating upper limbs in antiphase. A gait 
is normally established by a command from the brain to begin the gait by setting 
parameters for the CPGs, followed by a hierarchical set of reflex circuits. These 
circuits move the limbs and make many adjustments according to the ground 
surface and muscle fatigue during the movement.
Feeling and Acting: Connecting 
the CNS and PNS
The nerves and ganglia outside the spinal cord (and brain) constitute the periph￾eral nervous system (PNS). The PNS connects the CNS to the limbs and organs. The 
PNS is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous sys￾tem. (We discuss the autonomic nervous system in Chapter 10.) Here we take a 
quick look at the ascending sensory tracts and descending motor tracts within the 
spinal cord for the somatic nervous system.CHAPTER 9 Focusing On the Spinal Cord and Brain Stem 163
Somatosensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and axons of the motor neurons 
leaving the ventral root are part of the somatic PNS. Most (10 of 12) of the cranial 
nerves are also part of the PNS.  The somatosensory system is involved in the 
senses of touch, temperature, and various types of pain, and the sense of limb 
position and movement (called proprioception and kinesthesia).
Getting stimulated by neural sensors
The skin consists of an outer layer of cells called the epidermis and an inner layer 
of cells called the dermis (see Chapter 14 for more details). Within the dermis are 
somatosensory receptor cell endings. These include touch receptors (mechanore￾ceptors), hot and cold temperature receptors (thermoreceptors), and pain receptors 
(nociceptors). Within the muscles tendons and joints are proprioceptors. These sen￾sory neuron cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia. They send input to 
the spinal cord where the sensory information travels to the thalamus or cerebel￾lum through three major spinal cord white matter tracts (see Figure 9-4):
» Dorsal column medial lemniscus tracts: The large axons transmit the 
various kinds of discriminative touch sense (pressure, flutter, vibration) and 
conscious proprioception.
» Spinothalamic tracts: The smaller axons of the spinothalamic pathway 
transmit pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch information.
» Spinocerebellar tracts: The sensors for limb position, movement, and 
muscle tension (proprioceptors) located in skin, muscles, and joints transmit 
unconscious information to the cerebellum.
FIGURE 9-4:
Spinal cord tracts. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.164 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Moving with motor neuron inputs
Upper motor neurons project to the spinal cord via pyramidal tracts and extrapy￾ramidal tracts to control voluntary and involuntary muscle contraction. The tracts 
are as follows:
» Pyramidal tracts: Upper motor neurons in the motor cortex extend axon 
tracts called the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts. Corticobulbar tracts 
end at the brainstem and control movements of the head, face, and mouth. 
Corticospinal tracts are further divided:
• Lateral corticospinal tracts cross over at the pyramids of the medulla and 
control appendicular muscles that mediate limb movements.
• Anterior corticospinal tracts don’t cross over at the pyramids and control 
axial muscles of the trunk.
» Extrapyramidal tracts: Upper motor neurons in brainstem nuclei project to 
the spinal cord via the extrapyramidal tracts: vestibulospinal, reticulospinal, 
and tectospinal tracts (refer to Chapter 8). They provide involuntary control of 
axial muscles in the trunk and neck involved in posture and balance and head 
movements. The rubrospinal tract is a fourth extrapyramidal tract that 
provides minor control over voluntary upper limb movements.
Zeroing in on motor neurons-effectors
Alpha motor neurons typically innervate muscles on the same side of the body on 
which they exit the spinal cord. One alpha motor neuron and all the muscle fibers 
it projects to are called a motor unit. Gamma motor neurons innervate muscle 
spindles, which are involved in sensory feedback from muscles. The set of all the 
alpha and gamma motor neurons that project to a single muscle is called the motor 
neuron pool.
Fine muscle control is generally achieved by having a large number of alpha motor 
neurons, each with fewer muscle outputs, compared to a small number of alpha 
motor neurons that innervate hundreds of muscle fibers.
Alpha motor neurons are located in lamina IX in the middle of the ventral horn of 
the spinal cord gray matter. Alpha motor neurons that innervate more distal mus￾cles are located more laterally in the gray matter than those that innervate proxi￾mal muscles. Alpha motor neurons that innervate extensors tend to be located 
more ventrally than those that innervate flexors.CHAPTER 9 Focusing On the Spinal Cord and Brain Stem 165
Doing the heavy lifting: Muscle cells
Chapter 7 describes the neuromuscular junction and mechanisms of muscle con￾traction. When the muscle fiber is relaxed, the protein troponin binds to actin fila￾ments, preventing actin filaments from interacting with myosin filaments. In a 
relaxed muscle fiber, myosin binds and hydrolyzes ATP to activate it.
Increased calcium levels produced by the muscle cell action potential cause cal￾cium to bind to troponin, releasing it from actin, so the actin can bind to myosin 
forming the cross-bridges. When activated myosin interacts with actin, it acts like 
a molecular ratchet. After it binds to actin, the myosin proteins rotate in unison 
and pull the actin filament, so the muscle fiber shortens to produce contraction or 
tension.
Concluding with the spinal cord
With its complex circuitry the spinal cord receives motor commands from the 
brain and integrates those with sensory input from skin, muscles, and joints to 
produce voluntary movement and spinal reflexes, coordinate actions, ensure pos￾ture and balance, and generate locomotion. It also transmits somatosensory and 
visceral sensory information to the brain and mediates autonomic output. It works 
closely with the brainstem, the other evolutionary ancient part of the CNS.
Moving and Surviving with the Brainstem
Like the spinal cord, the brainstem mediates motor and sensory functions. It con￾trols voluntary movements of the mouth and tongue for speech, singing, and 
chewing. It generates facial expressions and eye movements. It’s an origin of 
autonomic control, and it relays somatic and visceral sensory information to the 
brain.
In addition, the brainstem is always working behind the scenes to control essen￾tial survival and homeostatic functions, like breathing, and control of heart rate, 
blood pressure, temperature, and sleep. It’s also involved in the modulation of 
pain transmission, emotion, and cognition. This following sections explore the 
functional anatomy of the brainstem.166 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Looking closer at the brainstem
Together, the medulla, pons, and midbrain form the brainstem, which is the tran￾sition between the brain and spinal cord. These are phylogenetically old brain 
structures that originated in primitive fish more than 500 million years ago and 
have evolved since then.
The brainstem contains white and gray matter regions. White matter regions con￾tain axons traveling within and from the brainstem and to and from the brain and 
spinal cord. Groups of neurons whose cell bodies are in the brainstem are called 
nuclei. Cranial nerve nuclei are the origins or targets of the cranial nerves. Other 
nuclei are involved in survival, homeostasis, and behavior.
All the cranial nerves except cranial nerves I and II originate in the brainstem. 
Figure 9-5 shows the brainstem in relation to the rest of the brain and spinal cord. 
The medulla, pons, and midbrain have very different anatomy and functions.
FIGURE 9-5:
The brainstem: 
medulla, pons, 
and midbrain.

In humans, the reticular formation is a group of more than a hundred intercon￾nected nuclei found along the entire brainstem with connections to the hypo￾thalamus, thalamus, forebrain, and cerebellum. It’s a major integration and relay 
center for many vital brain systems to coordinate functions necessary for 
survival.
The reticular formation mediates both ascending pathways involved in sleep, 
arousal, consciousness, emotion, and descending extrapyramidal pathways. The 
reticular formation is also important in homeostasis, which we cover more in 
Chapter 10. Several regions that we describe in the next sections contribute to the 
reticular formation.
Meeting the medulla
The most posterior and ventral area of the brain is called the medulla (or medulla 
oblongata). The lower border of the medulla is the top of the spinal cord. The tran￾sition occurs at a hole in the occipital bone at the base of the skull called the fora￾men magnum.
Carrying information
In the medulla (refer to Figure 9-5) white matter regions contain axonal tracts 
that carry sensory information from and motor information to the spinal cord. 
Several white matter tracts are located around the lateral regions of the medulla 
and include the pyramids and inferior cerebellar peduncles. One prominent medial 
tract is the medial lemniscus.
Two gray areas in the medulla, called the gracile and cuneate nuclei, are the relays 
for axons in the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway. Those axons originate 
with somatosensory neurons in the skin and transmit discriminative touch, vibra￾tion, and conscious proprioception.
Examining sensory input and motor output
The medulla receives sensory information from taste receptors in the tongue, 
somatosensory receptors in the skin of the head, and visceral sensory input from 
the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and digestive system. Sensory axons in several 
cranial nerves transmit this information to the medulla. Motor functions of the 
medulla include the following:
» Voluntary control of muscles of the tongue, the soft palate, and larynx 
associated with producing speech and to the glandular portions of 
these organs.168 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
» Regulation of important survival functions such as breathing and homeostasis 
by controlling heart rate, digestion processes, and blood vessels.
» Involuntary control of brainstem reflexes such as vomiting, coughing, 
sneezing, and swallowing.
Because the medulla controls so many body functions that are crucial to life — 
such as breathing and heart rate — any extensive damage to it is typically fatal.
Noting essential nuclei
Figure 9-6 shows several nuclei in the medulla. The medulla is a long structure 
and not all the nuclei shown would appear in every cross section.
The nuclei and their functions in the medulla are as follows:
» Nucleus of the solitary tract: This is also called the nucleus tractus solitarius
(NTS). The NTS is a column of many sensory nuclei that span the length of the 
medulla. It includes the gustatory nucleus that receives taste inputs. The NTS 
also receives sensory input from baroreceptors, chemoreceptors, and stretch 
receptors for the control of both somatic reflexes (breathing, gag, and cough 
reflexes) and autonomic responses.
FIGURE 9-6:
Medulla cross 
section. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.CHAPTER 9 Focusing On the Spinal Cord and Brain Stem 169
» Respiratory centers: The NTS sends signals to the two output respiratory 
centers located in the medulla:
• Dorsal respiratory group: The dorsal respiratory group initiates the 
inhalation phase of breathing. It’s located partially within and adjacent to 
the NTS.
• Ventral respiratory group: The ventral respiratory group controls both 
inhalation and exhalation. It is located near the nucleus ambiguus.
» Arcuate nucleus: The arcuate nucleus in the medulla receives input from 
chemoreceptors and contributes sensory input to the respiratory centers. 
(Note there is another arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus involved in 
hunger and satiety.)
» Vagus nucleus: Also called the dorsal nucleus of the vagus, this gives rise to 
CN X. Axons from this nucleus are preganglionic parasympathetic axons that 
emanate from the brainstem near the inferior olive. This nucleus controls 
parasympathetic functions in the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and 
abdomen.
» Hypoglossal nucleus: The hypoglossal nucleus gives rise to CN XII. This nerve 
innervates the muscles of the tongue that control chewing, swallowing, and 
speaking.
» Nucleus ambiguus: The inputs to this nucleus come from the corticobulbar 
tract, and its outputs are motor neurons that travel via the vagus nerve (CN X) 
to the pharynx, larynx, and esophagus.
» Inferior olive: The inferior olive receives inputs from the dorsal column 
medial lemniscus nuclei. Its output is to the cerebellum for motor coordina￾tion and learning. Within the cerebellum, the olivary axons are called climbing 
fibers that synapse on Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex.
Tracts of ascending (from spinal sensory neurons) and descending (from motor 
cortex) axons that go through the medulla cross over to the opposite side of the 
centerline of the body at what’s called the decussation of the pyramids. This crosso￾ver causes each of the two cerebral hemispheres to receive sensory input from, 
and control muscles on the opposite side of, the body. The crossing of sensory 
input at the midline of the medulla is called the sensory decussation.
Presenting the pons
Above the medulla lies the pons. You can see in Figure 9-5 that the pons bulges 
out in front of the ventral surface of the medulla below it. Projecting from the back 
of the pons is the cerebellum. Above the pons is the midbrain. The pons includes 
white matter tracts that transmit signals to the cerebellum, medulla, and 170 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
forebrain. It contains the nuclei for cranial nerves V through VIII. The pons con￾tains tracts that connect the forebrain with the cerebellum, medulla, and spinal 
cord. It also contains nuclei involved in receiving and relaying sensory informa￾tion and controlling motor functions: 
» Hearing and balance: Within the pons is a sensory nucleus for vestibuloco￾chlear nerve (CN VIII). The cochlear nucleus receives input from the inner ear 
and transmits sound information and localization through additional nuclei to 
the thalamus. Circuits for balance involve vestibular nuclei input from the 
inner ear. Outputs from vestibular nuclei project to the cerebellum and 
frontal lobes.
» Making faces: Facial expressions are controlled by sensory and motor nuclei 
for the facial nerve (CN VII). The pons receives some sensory input from the 
face and sends motor output to facial muscles to control both voluntary and 
involuntary facial expressions.
» Looking around: Pontine nuclei for the control of eye movements are 
mediated by the motor nucleus for abducens nerve (CN VI).
» Sensing and chewing: The motor and sensory nuclei of the trigeminal nerve 
(CN V) provides the majority of facial sensations and controls jaw movements.
» Secreting: The superior salivary nucleus in the pons helps produce tears and 
secrete saliva.
» Working with the medulla: Neural circuits involving both the pons and 
medulla control respiration, swallowing, sleep, and bladder emptying.
Monitoring the midbrain
The top level of the brainstem is called the midbrain. The midbrain works with the 
pons to control eye movements and relay sound information.
Moving the eyes
In mammals, the major visual area in the midbrain is called the superior colliculus. 
In lower vertebrates this midbrain region is called the optic tectum and is the 
major visual processing center. Mammals analyze visual input in the visual cortex 
and use the superior colliculus to control rapid eye movements called saccades and 
direct visual attention.
Cranial nerve nuclei for the oculomotor nerve (CN III) are located in the superior 
colliculus. The oculomotor nerve controls the eyelid and most eye movements. 
The area below the superior colliculus is called the inferior colliculus. The trochlear CHAPTER 9 Focusing On the Spinal Cord and Brain Stem 171
nucleus (CN IV) is located in the inferior colliculus and also controls eye 
movements.
Relaying and localizing sound
Auditory axons from the cochlear nucleus project to the superior olive. Neurons in 
the superior olive project to the inferior colliculus (see Figure 9-7). Neurons of the 
inferior colliculus project to neurons in the auditory region of the thalamus.
Noting other functions
The red nucleus in the midbrain is the origin of the rubrospinal tract, a minor 
control pathway for voluntary movement of upper limbs. The periaqueductal gray 
has a role in pain processing, vocalizations, defensive behavior, and autonomic 
functions.
The midbrain includes the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (VTA) that 
contain dopaminergic neurons. The substantia nigra is heavily connected with the 
basal ganglia in motor control. The VTA and other nuclei in the midbrain, such as 
the locus coeruleus, which contains noradrenergic neurons, and raphe nuclei, 
which contain serotonergic neurons, make extensive but diffuse modulatory pro￾jections throughout the neocortex. These projections are involved in setting basic 
brain states, such as what you’re attending to, alertness, drives, and goals.
FIGURE 9-7:

inferior colliculi.

Recently, addiction researchers have focused considerable attention on the mid￾brain VTA.  This nucleus sends dopaminergic axons to the nucleus accumbens, 
which projects to the prefrontal cortex. This circuit has been shown to be impor￾tant in motivation, reward, and addiction.
Counting on the cranial nerves
The eyes, ears, nose, and tongue are special sense organs. The 12 cranial nerves 
are involved in somatic, visceral, and special sensation and control of the somatic 
and autonomic motor systems. Unlike the spinal nerves that are all mixed nerves, 
some cranial nerves have dedicated sensory or motor functions and only four are 
mixed nerves.
The cranial nerves are considered part of the PNS, except for the olfactory nerve 
(I) and optic nerve (II). Cranial nerve III through XII originate in the brainstem 
and travel outside the CNS.  The olfactory and optic originate in and/or travel 
through the CNS. The body has two of each cranial nerve, and the nerves are gen￾erally bilaterally symmetrical about the midline.
The 12 cranial nerves are as follows:
» Olfactory nerve (I): Transmits the sense of smell from the nose. It terminates 
in the olfactory bulb.
» Optic nerve (II): Carries messages from retinal ganglion cells to the lateral 
geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, the superior colliculus, and other retinal 
recipient zones.
» Oculomotor nerve (III): Motor nerve for controlling eye movements and 
pupil dilation. Axons of this nerve originate in the oculomotor nucleus and 
Edinger–Westphal nucleus.
» Trochlear nerve (IV): A motor nerve that emanates from the dorsal midbrain 
trochlear nucleus and controls the superior oblique eye muscles.
» Trigeminal nerve (V): Sensory input comes from the face, and motor output 
controls chewing. It originates in the trigeminal nucleus of the pons and the 
spinal and mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. The motor component comes

information from the front of the tongue also reaches the brain by this nerve. 
Motor output includes control of the salivary and lacrimal glands.
» Acoustic (vestibulocochlear) nerve (VIII): A sensory nerve that transmits 
auditory and vestibular information to the brain from the spiral ganglion and 
Scarpa’s ganglion. Its axons terminate in the cochlear and vestibular nuclei.
» Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX): It transmits taste information from the back of 
the tongue to the medulla. Axons in the nerve also come from the nucleus 
ambiguous and inferior salivary nucleus. Motor output controls the secretion 
of the parotid gland.
» Vagus nerve (X): Originates in the posterolateral sulcus of the medulla, 
nucleus ambiguus, dorsal vagal nucleus, and solitary nucleus. Motor output 
controls laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles in the throat. It has a parasympa￾thetic output to control mucous membranes in the thorax and abdomen. 
Taste sensory information from the epiglottis travels to the brain by the 
vagus. The vagus is also crucial for controlling the vocal cords.
» Accessory nerve (XI): Is a motor nerve originating mostly from the nucleus 
ambiguus and spinal accessory nucleus. This nerve innervates the sternocleido￾mastoid and trapezius muscles that help to move the neck and turn the head.
» Hypoglossal nerve (XII): Is primarily motor and originates in the medulla 
hypoglossal nucleus. It controls the tongue and is important for speaking 
and swallowing.CHAPTER 10 Maintaining the Internal Environment 175

Maintaining the Internal 
Environment
The human brain evolved from primates, which evolved from mammals, 
which, in turn, evolved from brains of lower vertebrates like amphibians. 
The brain and its parts have many complex functions, besides allowing you 
to think deep thoughts. The brain integrates spinal cord control with sensory 
information from the eyes and ears, allowing you to keep your balance. It creates 
and retains long-term memories and produces the emotions and motivations 
behind behaviors.
As if that weren’t enough, the brain is always working behind the scenes to con￾trol functions that are essential to life, like breathing and the regulation of heart 
rate, blood pressure, and temperature. It also generates the rhythms of the body’s 
internal clock, telling you when to sleep and when to wake. This chapter explores 
all these functions and more.

nervous systems

functions

Finding the Right Tone: The Autonomic 
Nervous System
Your body does many things of which you’re not directly conscious. Breathing, 
swallowing, and coughing are automatic reflex responses that involve brain stem 
control of skeletal muscles (see Chapter 9). Regulation of blood flow, body tem￾perature, breathing rate, and circadian rhythms (your body’s internal clock) 
involves your autonomic nervous system.
The body’s ability to regulate its internal physiological processes — such as body 
temperature and rate of blood flow — and keep them stable and constant is called 
homeostasis. These homeostatic functions are necessary for life. Homeostatic 
functions of the nervous system evolved before all the brain’s higher cognitive 
abilities. Even invertebrates, like insects, maintain internal homeostasis. These 
sections discuss the divisions and functions of the autonomic nervous system, a 
major regulator of homeostasis.
Subdividing the autonomic nervous system
The autonomic nervous system has two main subdivisions — sympathetic and 
parasympathetic  — which are, in a large sense, antagonistic to each other. 
Both systems are constantly operating but their activities can be ramped up or 
damped down:
» The sympathetic system: This fight-or-flight system regulates your body for 
fast and enduring physical action in focused or emergency situations. It 
involves diverting blood supply from digestion to the muscles, mobilizing 
glucose, dilating the pupil, and increasing heart rate and blood pressure.
» The parasympathetic system: This rest and digest system does the opposite 
of the sympathetic system. It’s the system that reduces blood supply to 
skeletal muscle and enables digestion, immune responses, wound healing, 
responses for reproduction, and other types of body maintenance.
See Figure 10-1 for some of the functions of these two different branches of the 
autonomic nervous system.CHAPTER 10 Maintaining the Internal Environment 177
Why does the autonomic nervous system have this dual, antagonistic structure? 
Your ancestors once had to chase down their meals, often in dangerous situations, 
before they could eat. The sympathetic (fight-or-flight) system increased their 
heart rate and respiration for high activity, increasing blood sugar and diverting 
blood flow away from the digestive system to skeletal muscles. After they cap￾tured their meal and avoided injury, their parasympathetic systems slowed down 
their overall metabolism and directed blood flow to their digestive systems, allow￾ing the extraction of nutrients, and enhancing body repair and reproduction. All 
vertebrate animals have this dual system.
The sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems involve a type of motor neuron 
called a preganglionic neuron, with cell bodies located in spinal cord segments and 
brainstem. Preganglionic neurons extend their axons to control postganglionic 
neurons whose cell bodies are located in autonomic ganglia in the body or head.
Getting ready for action: The sympathetic system
The need to engage in strenuous, immediate, and enduring activity and deal with 
emergency situations activates the sympathetic division. This system originates 
with cholinergic preganglionic neurons located in the spinal cord thoracic and 
lumbar segments (T1 to L2), also called the thoracolumbar division. In the spinal 
cord, these motor neurons are located in the lateral horn and are called general 
FIGURE 10-1:

nervous system.

visceral efferents. These neurons synapse (releasing acetylcholine) with neurons in 
sympathetic ganglia, clusters of neurons located outside the spinal cord often run￾ning roughly parallel to it.
Some sympathetic preganglionic neurons project their axons to chromaffin cells 
in the adrenal medulla (part of the adrenal glands on the top of the kidneys). When 
stimulated, the chromaffin cells release epinephrine and norepinephrine into the 
bloodstream.
Postganglionic neurons in sympathetic ganglia extend their axons and synapse on 
target organs such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and digestive tract. The 
majority of postganglionic neurons use norepinephrine (noradrenaline) as their 
neurotransmitter. The tissues express different types of adrenergic receptors that 
can bind both norepinephrine and epinephrine. They’re metabotropic (G protein￾coupled) receptors that control ion channels and/or produce second messengers 
that mediate their responses (refer to Chapter 5).
Taking care of yourself: The parasympathetic 
system
The parasympathetic system is active during rest, enhancing relaxation and 
digestion and decreasing respiration and heart rate. Preganglionic parasympa￾thetic neurons are located in the brainstem (cranial nerves III, VII, IX, X) and the 
sacral spinal cord (S2 through S4), also called the craniosacral division. These pre￾ganglionic neurons also release acetylcholine.
They extend their axons over long distances to reach postganglionic neurons in 
ganglia located near their target organs. Postganglionic parasympathetic neurons 
release acetylcholine. Their target organs express muscarinic receptors, a metabo￾tropic (G protein-coupled) receptor type for acetylcholine (refer to Chapter 5).
Inputting to the autonomic nervous system
The autonomic nervous system continuously senses conditions within the body 
using visceral sensory neurons that innervate blood vessels and internal organs. 
They detect levels of chemicals and metabolites, gases, and other conditions 
important for body function. Here are some mechanoreceptors:
» Chemoreceptors sense levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and sugar.
» Baroreceptors in blood vessels detect arterial pressure.
» Thermoreceptors detect temperature.
» Other mechanoreceptors detect the stretch of organs.CHAPTER 10 Maintaining the Internal Environment 179
Visceral pain receptors sense signals that indicate damage to tissue or organs 
(refer to the next section for more information).
The cell bodies of visceral sensory neurons are located in dorsal root ganglia and 
sensory ganglia of cranial nerves. Visceral sensory information is transmitted to 
the thalamus, brainstem, or hypothalamus. Conscious perception of visceral states 
is relayed from the thalamus to the insula where the brain interprets feelings of 
hunger, fullness, internal pain, or nausea. Sensory input to the brainstem or 
hypothalamus is integrated to control autonomic motor output. The output from 
the autonomic system is an unconscious response. However you can be conscious 
of some autonomic effects such as your heart beating faster.
Responding with visceral reflexes
Visceral reflexes include simple spinal reflexes in which sensory neurons activate 
spinal interneurons, which in turn activate preganglionic autonomic neurons. An 
example is the micturition (urination) reflex in which the bladder’s smooth muscle 
contracts when it’s filled with urine.
Visceral reflexes can also involve cranial nerves that transmit to brainstem nuclei. 
An example is the baroreceptor reflex. When blood pressure is elevated, barore￾ceptors in the carotid sinus, where the internal and external carotid arteries meet, 
are activated. They transmit visceral sensory information along the glossopha￾ryngeal nerve to the brainstem. This input is integrated in the cardiac center in 
the medulla and stimulates the vagus nerve output to the heart. This parasympa￾thetic response decreases heart rate, which decreases blood pressure.
The visceral sensory region of the brainstem is called the nucleus of the solitary 
tract, also called the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) — refer to Chapter 9. It receives 
all visceral afferents. Through projections with cardiorespiratory and gastrointes￾tinal regulatory centers, it’s an essential part of the regulatory centers for internal 
homeostasis. It’s also part of several brainstem reflexes.
Controlling the Autonomic 
Nervous System
Control of the autonomic nervous system is provided by the brainstem, spinal 
cord, and hypothalamus. We discuss this system in greater detail here.180 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Regulating autonomic output with 
the brainstem and spinal cord
In the brainstem, the reticular formation has the most direct influence over auto￾nomic functions. The reticular formation is a phylogenetically ancient area with 
nearly a hundred interconnected nuclei. The medulla contains cardiac centers that 
regulate heart rate, the vasomotor center that regulates blood vessel diameter, 
and the nuclei that control digestion. We discuss other key functions of the retic￾ular formation in the section “Staying Alive with Reticular Formation” later in 
this chapter. In the midbrain, the periaqueductal gray controls autonomic 
responses, including the sympathetic fear response to threat.
Control of autonomic functions by interneurons in the spinal cord involves vis￾ceral spinal reflexes described in the section “Responding with visceral reflexes” 
earlier in this chapter. Although the urination reflex involves a reflex arc within 
the spinal cord, it can be consciously inhibited by the brain, which voluntarily 
controls the urinary output.
Integrating autonomic control 
by the hypothalamus
The hypothalamus is located below the left and right thalami and above the mid￾brain. It’s composed of 11 nuclei and integrates inputs from numerous brain 
regions to mediate essential homeostatic functions. It’s a central controller of the 
autonomic nervous system, controlling heartbeat, blood pressure, and digestion. 
It senses body temperature, hunger, and thirst and regulates behavioral responses 
to these. It connects the brain to the endocrine system by regulating output from 
the pituitary gland. And it’s involved in circadian rhythms, sleep, and arousal.
The hypothalamus receives inputs from the bloodstream and receives neuronal 
input from the brainstem reticular formation, NTS, ventrolateral medulla, limbic 
system, septal nucleus, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebral cortex.
Hypothalamic nuclei in posterior and lateral regions control sympathetic 
responses. Nuclei in anterior and medial regions control parasympathetic actions. 
Neurons in these nuclei send axons to preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord 
and brainstem, providing some direct control of autonomic output. Other nuclei 
provide input to the reticular formation and periaqueductal gray to control auto￾nomic output indirectly.
The hypothalamus receives inputs from the basal forebrain and limbic system, 
including the hippocampus and amygdala. The amygdala is a key limbic area for 
emotions, including fear. The amygdala provides direct input to the hypothalamus 
and also to the periaqueductal gray for fear-related behaviors.CHAPTER 10 Maintaining the Internal Environment 181
Because part of it lacks a blood-brain barrier, the hypothalamus is exposed to 
circulating blood and responds to hormones including insulin, angiotensin, and 
pituitary hormones. Nuclei within the hypothalamus also respond to blood osmo￾larity (solute concentration), plasma glucose concentration, and hormones 
released by the GI tract to mediate responses to thirst and hunger.
For regulation of body temperature, thermoreceptors in the hypothalamus send 
signals to autonomic motor neurons to stimulate heat production to raise the 
temperature or for sweating and vasodilation to cool it. It also creates fevers in 
response to infection.
The olfactory input — information about smells that come in through the nose — 
to the hypothalamus can mediate aspects of sexual behavior. Consider the case of 
pheromones, which are odorants animals produce that have unconscious behav￾ioral (often sexual) effects in others. (You generally aren’t even conscious of 
detecting these pheromones.)
Linking the brain to the endocrine system
The endocrine system is the system of glands that secrete hormones directly into 
the bloodstream to maintain homeostasis. It’s controlled by the autonomic ner￾vous system and the hypothalamus. Groups of glands that signal each other are 
called an axis, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
Examples of autonomic control of the endocrine system are the pancreas and 
adrenal medulla. Sympathetic activation decreases insulin release from the pan￾creas, while parasympathetic activation increases it. Sympathetic activation 
increases epinephrine and norepinephrine secretion from the adrenal medulla.
The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland. The posterior pituitary is 
essentially a group of axons from hypothalamic neurons that directly secrete 
oxytocin and vasopressin into the blood. Vasopressin regulates the kidneys to help 
reabsorb and conserve essential ions and proteins in the blood. It also constricts 
the peripheral vasculature. Oxytocin is essential for female reproduction, trigger￾ing contraction of the uterus during childbirth, and maternal behaviors such as 
pair bonding.
Other neurons in the hypothalamus send axons to the anterior pituitary where 
they secrete neurohormones called hypothalamic-releasing hormones. These 
stimulate the neurosecretory cells in the anterior pituitary gland to release spe￾cific pituitary hormones into the blood. The anterior pituitary releases seven hor￾mones involved in regulating growth during development, reproduction, control 
of stress and thyroid hormone levels, and homeostasis.182 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Oscillating with brain waves
Neural oscillations, or brainwaves, are rhythmic or repetitive patterns of neural 
activity in the CNS that can be measured by EEG. EEG rhythms are categorized in 
frequency bands: 
» Delta: Up to 4 Hertz (Hz), or cycles per second. These are the slowest waves 
and are associated with the deepest levels of sleep.
» Theta: 4 to 8 Hz. These waves are associated with a highly relaxed state such 
as while daydreaming during wakefulness and are present during lighter 
stages of sleep.
» Alpha: 8 to 13 Hz. These waves are present during wakefulness, when in a 
restful and relaxed state as when your eyes are closed. They also occur at 
different stages of the wake-sleep cycle. Mu waves are a type of alpha wave 
specific to the motor cortex.
» Beta: 13 to 30 Hz. These high frequency waves occur in the awake and alert 
state during your daily activities.
» Gamma: 30 to 100 Hz. These are the highest frequency waves that are 
present when you’re actively thinking, remembering and concentrating.
Neural tissue may generate brainwaves by activity within individual neurons, 
through interactions among neurons, or both. Brainwaves are important for per￾ception, for the generation of rhythmic motor output, for information transfer 
mechanisms, and for feature binding. Feature binding is the idea that different 
features of a particular object, such as size, shape, and location, are represented in 
neural firing at particular oscillation phases to create a person’s perception of the 
object. Oscillatory brain activity is an important mechanism underlying 
consciousness.
Sleeping and waking: Circadian rhythms
Another important nucleus in the hypothalamus is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
This nucleus controls circadian rhythms, the sleep/wake cycle. In sleep, conscious￾ness is absent or severely reduced, but in a different way than during hibernation 
or a coma. All animals sleep. The functions of sleep include restoration and repair 
of cells and tissues; removal and replacement of damaged proteins; regulation of 
metabolism, hormones and immune functions; and memory consolidation.
Synchronizing your intrinsic clocks with external light involves a special class of 
retinal ganglion cells that project to the SCN. These cells have their own visually 
activated G protein-coupled receptors that allows them to directly respond to 
light.CHAPTER 10 Maintaining the Internal Environment 183
Sleep cycles through several characteristic stages, each of which has unique prop￾erties. If you observe someone sleeping, you can see periods in which their eyes 
are moving nearly continuously, whereas during other periods the eyes move. 
This distinguishes rapid eye movement (REM) sleep from non-REM (NREM) 
sleep.
The predominant brain waves that can be detected with electroencephalography 
(EEG) also differ between sleep and wakefulness, and between different sleep 
phases. Figure 10-2 shows a typical night’s sleep phase plot, which is called a 
hypnogram.
Dreaming with REM sleep
REM sleep is the most like being awake, and most dreams occur in REM sleep. 
These high frequencies are similar to those seen in waking EEGs and may repre￾sent perceptual and motor experiences associated with dreaming. Infants not only 
sleep more than adults, but they also have a larger proportion of REM sleep. No 
one is sure why people dream. One theory is that synapses that are activated dur￾ing waking activities are pared back (in a process known as normalization) so that 
the brain is ready for renewed synapse growth during memory encoding. REM 
sleep has shown to be important for formation of long-term declarative memories 
(see Chapter 15).
REM sleep is characterized by high frequencies in the EEG. These high frequencies 
are associated with motor activities that occur in dreams, such as running, that 
are associated with frontal-lobe activity. However, the motor commands from the 
frontal lobe are blocked in the spinal cord so that actual movement doesn’t occur.

Going through NREM sleep
When you first fall asleep, you transition through the NREM stages to deep sleep. 
You then move up through those stages to REM sleep. Often after you descend 
through the phases in order, N1 to N4, the sleep then oscillates irregularly between 
phases after that. Late in the sleep period the phase sequences tend to be shal￾lower, sometimes not reaching N3 or N4, with some brief transitions from REM to 
momentary wakefulness. Slow-wave sleep consists of N3 of non-REM sleep. 
Slow-wave sleep has also been shown to be important for formation of long-term 
declarative memory (refer to Chapter 15).
Sleep phases are characterized by distinct changes in EEG patterns, examples of 
which you can see in Figure 10-3. Wakefulness is associated with beta rhythms in 
the EEG. Mental relaxation and meditation shift the EEG rhythms from beta to 
alpha. In the earliest stage of sleep, characteristic slow eye movements occur, 
technically called slow rolling eye movements (SREMs). About this time, alpha waves 
nearly disappear from the EEG, and theta waves begin to predominate. Stage N2 
of sleep is also dominated by theta waves, but they change to delta waves in N3 
and N4. N4 is the deepest stage of sleep, from which it’s the most difficult to 
awaken.

Staying Alive with the Reticular Formation
The reticular formation is an ancient brainstem area that courses throughout much 
of the subcortex. The word reticular is derived from the Latin word for net. It com￾prises more than 100 neural circuits that control essential body functions and 
extends up from spinal projections to the medulla, through the midbrain and 
pons, to reticular area of the thalamus. The reticular formation interacts with 
numerous brain areas to control life processes, such as regulation of breathing 
and heart rate, temperature, and wakefulness. Damage to the reticular formation 
typically results in coma or death. Here we examine reticular formation in greater 
detail.
Separating the reticular formation
Some motor neurons in the primary motor cortex send axon branches to nuclei in 
the reticular formation in the medulla. These reticular nuclei are the origin of the 
reticulospinal tracts that send axons to the spinal cord motor areas to maintain bal￾ance during body movements. Reticular nuclei also receive visual and auditory 
inputs relayed from the cerebellum for motor coordination.
The reticular formation in the medulla can be divided into groups of nuclei that 
form three major columns. These nuclei send axonal projections through the 
medulla and into the midbrain. The columns are as follows:
» Median column: Also known as the Raphe nuclei, it sends axons diffusely 
through the neocortex that release serotonin.
» Medial column: Also known as the magnocellular column, it sends projections 
to the medulla and midbrain and may be involved in sleep/wakefulness 
control.
» Lateral column: Also known as the parvocellular column, it projects to the 
medulla and midbrain. Its functions aren’t well characterized.
Controlling functions
The reticular formation controls the cardiovascular system via its cardiac and vas￾omotor centers in the medulla. It’s also involved in pain modulation. Some pain 
signals from the body are relayed by medulla nuclei that project to the cortex. In 
addition, descending axons from cortical pain perception areas provide input to 
medulla nuclei. These nuclei extend axons to the spinal cord that can inhibit 
transmission of some pain signals to the brain.186 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Ascending projections from the reticular formation to the thalamus and cortex 
control or gate the sensory signals reaching these structures. The reticular forma￾tion is a gateway for essential functions of states of consciousness and awareness 
versus sleep. Other motor nuclei in the reticular formation control the ability of 
the eyes to track objects and central pattern generators that coordinate muscles 
for breathing and swallowing.
Modulating activity: Reticular 
activating system
Reticular formation nuclei that modulate activity of the cerebral cortex are part of 
the reticular activating system (RAS). The RAS is a neural circuit by which the brain￾stem interacts with the cortex through relays in thalamic nuclei. The RAS also 
includes the dorsal hypothalamus. The RAS midbrain reticular formation controls 
transitions from relaxed wakefulness to focused attention.
The main neurotransmitters used by the RAS are acetylcholine and noradrenaline; 
they operate in an antagonistic manner to regulate states of awareness and con￾sciousness by controlling thalamo-cortical activity. Projections that release ace￾tylcholine from the RAS to the thalamus, basal forebrain, substantia nigra, and 
cerebellum are increased during wakefulness and REM sleep.
Most of the noradrenaline output of the RAS is from the locus coeruleus in the 
pons. These neurons project to many of the same areas to which the cholinergic 
RAS system projects, but with opposite effects: They’re active during waking and 
slow-wave sleep, but not during REM sleep. The locus coeruleus also projects to 
the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord.
Continuing through the thalamus 
and cortex
Extensions of the RAS project to the thalamus in the thalamic reticular nucleus 
and peri-geniculate nucleus. Thalamic reticular nuclei receive input from dorsal 
thalamic nuclei and the cerebral cortex, in addition to inputs from brainstem 
reticular nuclei.
The function of the thalamic reticular areas appears to be to modulate the infor￾mation projected from other nuclei in the thalamus to the cortex. For example, 
although you may be concentrating on reading a sign in front of you, rapid move￾ment toward you in your peripheral vision may pull your attention toward the 
movement. This would also be true if you heard a loud noise behind you. The 
reticular formation controls not only whether you’re awake or asleep, but also 
important aspects of what you pay attention to while awake.CHAPTER 10 Maintaining the Internal Environment 187
Controlling Your Motives: 
The Limbic System
The word limbic derives from the Latin limbus or “edge.” It describes anatomical 
structures that border on the edges of the thalamus. The term limbic system refers 
to a group of nuclei and tracts above the brainstem and below the neocortex (sub￾cortical), originally postulated to control drives and instincts. It’s phylogeneti￾cally very old and exists in nonmammalian vertebrates that perform complex 
behaviors with little or no neocortex. They use the limbic system and basal ganglia 
for neural control of behavior.
As originally conceived, the limbic system consists of the cingulate cortex, hip￾pocampal complex, amygdala, septum, anterior thalamic nuclei, limbic cortex, 
and hypothalamus. Most regions of the limbic system have extensive connections 
beyond the limbic system and functions beyond emotional control of behavior. 
Also, the limbic system doesn’t have exclusive rights to emotion. Emotions are 
contributed by and controlled by other regions of the brain.
The use of the term limbic system is controversial among neurobiologists. Lumping 
these brain structures together as a limbic system probably isn’t valid. Still, the 
idea of an evolutionarily older, subcortical processing system whose output is an 
emotional state that affects behavior still has some validity, and this term is still 
used today.
Evolution tried two other types of cortex before settling on building the majority 
of the mammalian brain from neocortex. These are allocortex and mesocortex, 
shown in Figure 10-4. These evolutionarily older types of cortex are associated 
with the limbic system. The limbic system is a collection of structures from the 
midbrain, diencephalon, allocortex, and mesocortex.
Going from allocortex to mesocortex 
to neocortex
Allocortex and mesocortex predate the neocortex in evolution. But these older 
cortical areas are crucial for brain function even in animals like humans who have 
a very large neocortex. Allocortex is the oldest cortex, having three to five layers. 
It’s the type of brain structure in the hippocampal complex (called archicortex) and 
primary olfactory cortex (called paleocortex). Mesocortex is a six-layered brain 
structure in what’s called the paralimbic region between neocortex and allocortex. 
It includes the cingulate gyrus, insula, some of the orbitofrontal cortex, and the 
parahippocampal gyrus.188 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival

EMOTIONAL PROCESSING
Although science fiction often portrays emotionless characters such as Mr. Spock as 
superior beings, would we as humans really be better off without emotions? Why would 
we have evolved emotions if they only get us into trouble? The answer is that emotions 
allow us to avoid trouble far more often than they cause it.
Remember: Emotions existed before reason. Feelings — the content of emotions — 
are the brain’s way of telling us if something is good or bad, and whether it’s important, 
without having to go through a long and perhaps faulty chain of reasoning about the 
results of some action (or inaction). Emotions are the means by which the part of your 
brain that processes incoming sensory information communicates likely outcomes to 
the part of your brain that executes actions. This communication depends on a set of 
sub-neocortical structures called the limbic system that include brain regions that are 
cortex, but not neocortex.CHAPTER 10 Maintaining the Internal Environment 189
Organizing thoughts and activities 
with the cingulate gyrus
One of the original limbic areas is the cingulate gyrus, a mesocortical area that 
lies mostly between the corpus callosum fiber tract and the neocortex (see 
Figure 10-5).
The cingulate gyrus receives inputs from the thalamus and the neocortex, and 
projects to the entorhinal cortex around the hippocampus via the cingulum. One 
function proposed for the cingulate gyrus is to allocate processing among other 
cortical areas, making it a mediator of executive function.
The cingulate gyrus is typically divided into anterior and posterior regions, with 
the dividing line above the anterior thalamus:
» Anterior cingulate cortex: This area appears to be involved in motivation, 
the reward anticipation, and the perception of pain or even the expectation of 
pain. It’s also involved in attention allocation, decision making, and impulse 
control. Imaging studies show that it’s activated when you make mistakes and 
when you receive conflicting information.
» Posterior cingulate cortex: Less is known about this area, but it appears to 
be involved in awareness and the allocation of working memory along with 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It’s a central node of the default mode 
network that’s active when you daydream. It has been implicated in pain 
and episodic memory retrieval.

Creating memories with the hippocampus
You can remember the security code you’ve been texted for only about as long as 
it takes to type it in, but you never forget your Social Security number (unless you 
develop a form of dementia like Alzheimer’s disease). The hippocampus controls 
the formation of long-term memories like facts and words, as well as what are 
called episodic memories of events.
Short-term memory is used in what’s called working memory, mediated by the 
lateral prefrontal cortex. Information can pass from short-term to long-term 
memory if you’ve rehearsed it, you’re repeatedly exposed to, or it’s an important 
fact or event. The hippocampus is required for the encoding of long-term declara￾tive memories for facts and events. Other types of memory such as procedural 
memory for skills and habits are encoded by different regions of the brain. 
Chapter 15 describes the role of the hippocampus and mechanisms of memory.
The synapses between specific neurons in the hippocampus undergo synaptic 
plasticity during memory encoding. To produce a long-term memory, the hippo￾campus signals back to the neurons in the neocortex that provided the informa￾tion to be associated and remembered. Neurons in the neocortex form their own 
memory circuit that can be activated by future cues.
The output of the hippocampus is through a fiber tract called the fimbria. The 
axons from the hippocampi on each side of the brain merge at the midline where 
the tract is called the fornix (refer to Figure 10-5). The fornix divides at the ante￾rior commissure. The anterior axon tract is called the precommissural fornix. It 
projects to the nucleus accumbens, which is involved in reward and implicated in 
addiction (see the section “Motivating with the basal ganglia” later in this chap￾ter) and to septal nuclei. Some fornix axons form the post-commissural fornix 
and project through the hypothalamus to the mammillary bodies. These in turn 
project to the anterior nuclei of the thalamus, which projects to the cingulate 
cortex.
Feeling emotional with the 
amygdala and beyond
The amygdala is a central structure for detection and integration of salient emo￾tional stimuli and contributes to emotion stimulated responses. It’s involved in 
modifying responses in sensory cortex to favor relevant items. It recruits top￾down attention in the frontal-parietal cortex and contributes to hippocampal 
dependent memory. It also drives autonomic responses by inputs to the hypothal￾amus and brainstem.CHAPTER 10 Maintaining the Internal Environment 191
One role of the amygdala is in evaluating the emotional valence of situations to 
determine if they’re scary (fearful), happy, or sad. The amygdala helps the brain 
recognize potential threats and contributes to autonomic responses through 
output to the hypothalamus. The amygdala is also responsible for reward- or 
punishment-based learning.
The amygdala is located anterior to the hippocampus in the temporal lobe. The 
amygdala is involved in processing memories that have high emotional salience, 
such as fear, and it projects back to the prefrontal cortex. The role of the amygdala 
in fear memory has been studied in animal models using fear conditioning. Through 
its inputs to the hippocampus, the amygdala also contributes emotional content 
to declarative memories (see Chapter 15 for the role of the amygdala in memory).
The amygdala encodes long-term emotional memories through connections with 
the neocortex, primarily, the orbitofrontal cortex. The orbitofrontal cortex is 
involved in emotional responses to contexts, such as being nervous when betting 
a large sum of money. Lesions to the anterior temporal lobe that include the 
amygdala produce hypo-emotionality, loss of fear, and hypersexuality in experi￾ments on nonhuman primates.
Other brain areas are involved in emotion, motivation, and reward processing. 
These include the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and 
anterior insula. These areas contribute to the recognition of relevant sensory 
input, motivation for action, and generation of appropriate emotional responses. 
Other subcortical regions involved in emotion, motivation, and reward include the 
basal ganglia and cerebellum.
Assigning with the insula (insular cortex)
The insula (insular cortex) is a portion of the mesocortex located in the deep fis￾sure that separates the temporal from the parietal and frontal lobes. Above the 
insula is a structure called the operculum, which means “lid.” It’s highly intercon￾nected with the limbic system and is important in assigning emotional signifi￾cance to sensory input. It receives inputs from sensory areas of the thalamus and 
projects to the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum of the basal 
ganglia. It also projects directly to areas of the motor cortex.
The executive control of the insula includes coordinating the regulation of some 
aspects of homeostasis, the conscious perception and awareness of pain, and 
some aspects of motor control. Awareness of the amount of pain, and even imag￾ining pain, activates the insula, particularly on the right side. It’s also involved in 
the high-level control of the autonomic system.192 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
In motor control, the insula operates as an executive control center that regulates 
heart rate and blood pressure to levels appropriate for the level of the body’s exer￾tion and emotional state. It also appears to have a role in speech articulation and 
some poorly understood aspects of body awareness, emotions, and social aware￾ness via its connections to the limbic system.
Motivating with the basal ganglia
Chapter 8 describes the important role of the basal ganglia in action selection in 
the control of voluntary movement. The basal ganglia also function in processing 
emotions, motivation, and reward.
Rewards are things you desire, such as objects, stimuli, or activities that have 
positive value. They produce a conscious experience of pleasure through excite￾ment, satisfaction, relaxation, awe, or physical responses to touch, eating, or 
sexual behavior. Rewards can induce an animal to switch from one behavior to 
another. Motivation is the desire to seek a goal by initiating, guiding, and main￾taining goal- or reward-oriented behavior.
The striatum is the main input region for the basal ganglia that receives inputs 
from many regions of the cerebral cortex. The dorsal striatum functions in motor 
control and procedural memory. The ventral striatum includes an area called the 
nucleus accumbens. Besides cortical inputs to the nucleus accumbens there are 
inputs from the limbic system and dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmen￾tal area (VTA) in the midbrain called the mesolimbic system.
In humans, one proposed function of dopamine is to produce subjective pleasure 
or the anticipation of pleasure. When rewarding stimuli are detected, the dopami￾nergic mesolimbic system is activated, which causes the release of dopamine to 
several areas, including the nucleus accumbens. Through the action of dopamine, 
activity in the nucleus accumbens stimulates motivation and behaviors to obtain 
a reward or goal.
The output from the nucleus accumbens pathway is to the thalamus, which relays 
output to the cerebral cortex. For the nucleus accumbens pathway, the prefrontal 
cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus form a cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loop 
that is an important emotional processing pathway in the brain.CHAPTER 10 Maintaining the Internal Environment 193
Coordinating with the cerebellum again
The cerebellum may also be involved in the subjective or feeling aspect of emo￾tion. It may contribute to emotional expressions that are important in social com￾munication. It may contribute to cognitive processes that determine the emotional 
significance of events and may modulate some emotions.
Together the basal ganglia and cerebellum may contribute to a range of functions 
including recognition of emotional stimuli, including voices or faces. Both may 
function in reward processing, contribute to autonomic responses, participate in 
inferring the emotional state of others (theory of mind), and contribute to your 
awareness of subjective feelings.
Integrating with the prefrontal cortex
Some more complex emotions are associated with social interactions and include 
pride, empathy, embarrassment, shame, and guilt. These emotions are similar to 
the primary emotions of sadness, pleasure and fear because they produce physi￾ological changes and behaviors that you experience as distinct conscious feelings. 
Social emotions may depend especially on the prefrontal cortex, which has a sig￾nificant role in emotional control. We discuss these topics further in Chapter 11 
when we describe the neocortex in more detail.CHAPTER 11 Topping It Off: The Neocortex 195
Chapter 11
Topping It Off: The 
Neocortex
The neocortex is at the summit of the hierarchy of brain processing. It’s the 
neural circuit area that is most enlarged in mammals, and it allows you to 
set goals, change your goals when you need to, and store memories that 
inform future decisions. Thanks to the development of the neocortex, we humans 
evolved into the intelligent (well, mostly) and adaptable creatures we are today. In 
this chapter, we tell you all about this important part of the brain.
You’re probably aware that your brain has two sides, or hemispheres — one left 
and one right. The left side of the brain generally receives inputs from and 
controls the right side of the body, while the right side of the brain interacts with 
the left side. Here, you meet your two hemispheres and we tell you more about 
what they do. We also discuss the differences that exist between the male and 
female brain.

Looking Inside the Skull: The Neocortex
The neocortex evolved in mammals. In some lineages, including whales, dolphins, 
elephants, and primates, the neocortex expanded dramatically during evolution. 
The neocortex is the region of the brain that’s involved in voluntary motor 
control, perception, and a number of complex behaviors exhibited by mammals. 
In the following sections we look at the anatomical and functions regions of the 
neocortex and describe the organization and circuitry of the neurons.
Examining the lobes
Looking at a human brain from above or from the side, virtually all you see is neo￾cortex, with the cerebellum sticking out from the back of the brainstem below the 
occipital lobe. Neurobiologists divide the neocortex into four anatomical lobes (see 
Figure 11-1):
» Frontal: The frontal lobe extends from the most anterior part of the brain 
behind the forehead to a groove near the middle of the brain called the 
central sulcus. The anterior area is the prefrontal cortex concerned with plans, 
FIGURE 11-1:
Lobes of the 
neocortex.

ideas, and contingencies. It projects to many areas, including the motor cortex 
that controls voluntary movement.
» Parietal: The parietal lobe begins at the central sulcus and extends posteriorly 
to the occipital lobe and to its ventral border with the temporal lobe. The 
parietal lobe contains the somatosensory cortex and an association area 
that processes somatosensory, visual, and auditory information. It provides 
sensory feedback for planning and movement and is essential for your 
awareness of space.
» Temporal: The temporal lobe has three main divisions:
• The superior temporal gyrus processes auditory information that then 
projects to the association area in the parietal lobe.
• The inferior temporal gyrus processes visual information along the ventral 
stream that allows you to identify objects.
• The medial temporal lobe has a high-level visual area called the fusiform 
face area that processes faces and other complex visual stimuli. It also 
contains older cortical regions called allocortex involved in memory, 
olfaction, and emotion.
» Occipital: The occipital lobe is dedicated to visual processing. It contains the 
primary visual cortex V1, and higher-order visual areas such as V2 and V3. 
Visual information is projected out of the occipital lobe along the dorsal 
stream to the parietal lobe and the ventral stream to the temporal lobe.
Most cortical brain areas extend down into the sulci (grooves), which comprise a 
large percentage of the total neocortical area (about 2,400 square centimeters). 
Functional areas may extend over different gyri (ridges or folds) and sulci.
Illustrations of the brain typically show sections that can be in one of three planes, 
as you can see in Figure 11-2: 
» A horizontal section is parallel to the ground.
» A sagittal section is from front to back, typically along the midline of the brain, 
dividing it into left and right halves.
» A coronal section is in a plane roughly parallel to the forehead.
Each of these section planes show the neocortex. It consists of a thin 2- to 
4-millimeter gray area on the surface, with a larger white area below. The gray 
matter is where the neurons, dendrites and synapses are located. The white 
matter contains axon tracts myelinated by oligodendrocytes. Both gray and white 
matter also contain astrocytes and blood capillaries.198 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Noticing uniform structure and circuits
One of the most important organizational principles of the neocortex is that it has 
a standard, six-layered structure. Figure  11-3 shows a region of the neocortex 
consisting of a sulcus between two gyri (left). The gray matter is a thin sheet of 
neurons sitting on top of the white matter.
FIGURE 11-2:

section the brain.

BIG BRAINS
The larger the brain, the more white matter it has. Why? Suppose that in the brain, 
every neuron were directly connected to every other neuron. If the number of neurons 
were to grow, the number of axons would have to increase as the square of the number 
of neurons. Connecting every one of the 86 billion neurons in the human brain to every 
other neuron would require a white matter volume the size of a house!
The brain solves this problem by having any given neuron connected to a few thousand 
other neurons (on average), with the densest connections to nearby neurons, so that 
most axonal lengths are short. A finite number of major axon projection tracts send 
information long distances in the brain. Information is highly compressed in these pro￾jections. For example, about one million visual axons from the thalamus drive about 
200 million cortical neurons in V1.CHAPTER 11 Topping It Off: The Neocortex 199
Different types of axon tracts form the white matter:
» Projection tracts have axons leaving the neocortex and projecting to subcorti￾cal structures or the spinal cord.
» Association tracts have axons projecting from one cortical area to a different 
cortical area on the same side of the brain. They can be long or short range.
» Commissural tracts have axons projecting from one cortical area to the same 
area on the opposite side of the brain.
» Ascending tracts have axons projecting from the spinal cord and brainstem to 
the brain.
The right side of Figure 11-3 is an illustration of the gray matter, which comprises 
six layers of neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, synapses, and short unmyelinated 
axons. The fundamental output neuron in the neocortex is the pyramidal neuron, 
a type of excitatory glutamatergic neuron. The other neurons (not shown) include 
excitatory glutamatergic stellate neurons and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons 
(see Chapter 6).
The types of neurons in the six layers and the inputs and outputs from neurons in 
these layers are very similar across the neocortex. This is amazing given that the 
neocortex processes inputs from very different senses and produces movements 
all using similar neuronal circuits.
The organization of the neocortex involves cortical minicolumns. A cortical 
minicolumn is a vertical column through the cortical thickness with a diameter of 
30 to 40 micrometers, comprising about 100 neurons from layers 1 through 6. 
Neurons within a cortical minicolumn are highly interconnected. Cortical mini￾columns are considered the basic unit of cortical organization with each column 
FIGURE 11-3:

matter and 
layers.

functioning as a computational unit. The human neocortex is composed of about 
200 million minicolumns in parallel vertical arrays.
Communicating through connections
Each layer of the neocortex has a characteristic distribution of neurons and con￾nections with other cortical and subcortical regions. The layers also contain glial 
cells and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. The layers and connection in neo￾cortex are as follows: 
» Layer 1: Called the molecular layer, it consists mainly of apical dendrites from 
pyramidal neurons in the cortical column and horizontally oriented axons. It 
contains a few GABAergic neurons. It receives inputs from other cortical layers 
and the thalamus.
» Layers 2 and 3: They’re called the external granular layer and the external 
pyramidal layer, respectively. Layers 2 and 3 are often grouped together and 
called Layer 2/3 because they’re functionally similar. Layer 2/3 contains 
stellate neurons and small- to medium-size pyramidal neurons. Pyramidal 
neurons in Layer 2/3 project axons to other cortical areas. They also project to 
Layer 5. Layer 2/3 is the target of axons coming from other cortical areas and 
from Layer 4 neurons.
» Layer 4: Known as the internal granular layer, it contains stellate and pyramidal 
neurons. Layer 4 is the main target of incoming axons from the thalamus. Layer 
4 axons project to neurons in Layer 2/3 and Layer 6 within the same column.
» Layer 5: Known as the internal pyramidal layer, it contains large pyramidal 
neurons. Their axons extend to subcortical areas including the basal ganglia, 
brainstem, and spinal cord. Layer 5 neurons also project to other cortical 
areas. Layer 5 neurons receive inputs from Layer 2/3.
» Layer 6: Referred to as the multiform layer, it contains large pyramidal neurons, 
small spindle-like pyramidal, and multiform neurons. Layer 6 neurons receive 
input from and project to Layer 4. Layer 6 neurons send axons to the thalamus 
for reciprocal connections between cortex and thalamus.
Figure 11-4 shows the typical inputs, outputs, and intracortical connections within 
the neocortical layers. Most layers also receive inputs from brainstem modulatory 
neurons. Intracortical circuits also exhibit mutual excitation that must be bal￾anced by inhibitory pathways that aren’t shown. Though similar in neuronal types 
and connections, the number and density of neurons and size of the layers vary 
somewhat between different functional regions of neocortex. For example, layer 4 
is larger in primary sensory cortex that receives massive inputs from the thala￾mus. Layer 5 is larger in primary motor cortex, the origin of the corticospinal and 
corticobulbar tracts.CHAPTER 11 Topping It Off: The Neocortex 201
Given its common circuit types, the neocortex produces common neuronal com￾putations on its inputs. A given area of cortex seems to be able to process a set 
number of inputs. This implies that when more sensory cells are in an area of 
skin, or retina, or anywhere else for higher resolution, the brain uses more cortical 
area that contains more local minicolumns to process the larger number of inputs.
More complex computations are done in a hierarchy of cortical areas. A low level 
area processes the input from the thalamus, extracts some information, and sends 
its output to a higher level area. This higher area does the same, sending its output 
to some even higher, more selective area, building up a hierarchy of selectivity.
Using a single circuit type for all sensory and motor neural computation in 
neocortex is one of the most remarkable traits of mammals. Many neurobiologists 
believe that it’s the key to mammals’ success and the ultimate generator of human 
intelligence and consciousness.
Getting to the Brain You Have Today
The protoreptilian brain corresponds to the hindbrain region of the mammalian 
brain; it’s thought to have arisen first about 550 million years ago (MYA) in ver￾tebrate evolution. It contains brainstem areas that sustain survival. The basal 
ganglia evolved soon after this. The paleomammalian brain arose around 225 MYA 
with the evolution of the limbic system in the first mammals. It’s involved in 
emotion and motivation for feeding and reproduction. The neomammalian
FIGURE 11-4:

Inputs and 
outputs.

complex arose as mammals evolved, around 200 MYA; this system is thought to 
permit abstract planning and, ultimately in humans, language.
Here are two major ideas about how the neocortex relates to the rest of the brain: 
» The neocortex sits at the apex of a controller hierarchy. It sets the big-picture 
goals and procedures and allows lower levels to take care of the details.
» The neocortex functions like a set of subroutines in a computer program. The 
main procedure in subcortical areas is actually the sequence controller that 
calls subroutines (particular computational areas of neocortex) for doing 
detailed calculations at high resolution.
These ideas appear to be quite distinct, so which is right? We argue that both are 
correct and that the neocortex and subcortical areas interact to control behavior.
You decide to take a trip. Decisions involve your neocortex about various ways to 
travel, such as by car or by plane. The decision also involves goals about the pur￾pose of the trip and your current state of affairs (money in your bank account, 
vacation time, and so forth). Dealing with conflicting goals and states involves the 
anterior cingulate cortex (which is mesocortex, not neocortex) and the thalamus. 
These subcortical brain structures use memory and information from the neocortex 
to decide when and where to travel and how to get there. Figure 11-5 illustrates this.
This is a hierarchical system because the details of how to carry out tasks in various 
ways reside in the neocortex. If you were monitoring brain activity while a person 
was taking a plane from point A to point B, you’d say that areas of the frontal lobe 
neocortex were controlling the procedure. But also true is that the method of trans￾port you use (a plane) and the alternatives you take within that method (choosing 
the window or aisle seat) are decided by lower-level brain systems with input from 
FIGURE 11-5:

controller or 
subroutine?

the neocortex. In that sense the relationship between subcortical and cortical levels 
is more like the former calling subroutines in the latter.
The next sections discuss how the neocortex develops. This information is useful 
to understand the formation of minicolumns, the basic computational unit in the 
neocortex, and the evolution of the neocortex.
Looking at how the neocortex develops
During embryonic development of the neocortex, stem cells in the neural tube pro￾liferate and then give rise to progenitor cells called radial glial cells (RGCs). RGCs also 
divide and generate cells that migrate outward to form the layers of the neocortex.
After arriving at their layer, the RGC-derived cells differentiate into glutamatergic 
neurons or glial cells. Researchers propose that the direct neuronal descendants of 
RGCs in vertical columns become interconnected and provide the basis of cortical 
minicolumns. Chapter  3 provides more information about development of the 
neocortex.
Enlarging the frontal lobes for 
complex behavior
Mammals increased their brains’ abilities to do complex computations by devel￾oping and expanding the neocortex and adding more units, the cortical minicol￾umns. In mammalian evolution, this cortical expansion led to higher resolution 
and more complex perceptions. In human evolution it led to increased executive 
functions and language.
One aspect of the success of the neocortex is its uniform organization. The same 
neural circuit type is used to increase resolution in everything from processing 
visual detail to sequencing muscle movements.
Neocortical resolution is enhanced in two ways:
» The area devoted to a task increases the resolution at which a limited 
number of computations are performed within in a particular area. For 
example, in the visual system, animals with larger numbers of retinal 
ganglion cells have a primary visual cortex with more area — the area of 
visual cortex per ganglion cells is about the same. Attributes such as orienta￾tion, depth perception, and color are extracted within an area.
» Resolution is increased in the kinds of perceptions that can be produced by increas￾ing the number of distinct cortical areas in a hierarchy. Each area does some set of 
feature extractions. These extracted features are fed into the next area, which 
starts with those features as a basis and extracts even more complex features.204 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Setting and accomplishing goals
During primate evolution the size of the neocortex increased — specifically, the 
frontal and prefrontal cortex. Figure 11-6 shows the relative sizes of the neocortex 
in the cat, rhesus monkey, chimpanzee, and human. The prefrontal cortex in each 
is in a darker shade. Prefrontal cortex increased as a percent and in absolute area, 
from nonprimates to primates to monkeys to apes to humans.
The frontal lobe constitutes about 40 percent of the neocortex. It contains the pre￾frontal cortex, motor cortex, frontal eye fields, and Broca’s area. The prefrontal 
cortex is the seat of abstract planning, decision-making, reasoning, and working 
memory. It allows you to keep complex ideas in mind. The prefrontal cortex moves 
you from having actions that are largely reactive and dependent on a stimulus to 
having plans that are more flexible and driven by your goals.
As Chapter 8 describes, the motor cortex contains the supplementary and premo￾tor cortices that organize instructions for groups of muscles to accomplish spe￾cific tasks. In the primary motor cortex, neurons send their axons to the brainstem 
or spinal cord and synapse on alpha motor neurons (and interneurons) that con￾trol muscle contraction. The frontal eye fields control eye movements and are 
involved in visual attention. Broca’s area is a language area that we describe in the 
section “Specializing for language” later in this chapter.
The prefrontal cortex can be functionally divided into two broad regions, lateral 
and ventromedial. The lateral prefrontal cortex includes the dorsolateral and ven￾trolateral prefrontal cortex. Another name for the ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
is the orbitofrontal cortex.
FIGURE 11-6:

comparison of 
the prefrontal 
cortex.

The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functions, with two main types: 
» Organizational executive functions: Working memory, planning, and 
problem-solving are examples.
» Regulatory abilities: Self-control, emotional regulation, and moral reasoning 
are examples.
Making Decisions: The Lateral 
Prefrontal Cortex
We as humans don’t always live in the present. We think about the future and we 
think about the past. This ability allows people to make plans with a complex 
hierarchy of goals and subgoals and modify these plans as we carry them out if 
things don’t go as expected.
The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex enables the brain to represent information that 
isn’t in your current environment, as working memory. Working memory is what 
you purposely keep in your mind to complete a task. It’s necessary to remember 
what you’re doing, and what needs to be done next, by preventing you from being 
distracted by irrelevant stimuli and thoughts. This ability to use a representation 
of your goal to stay focused — as we examine in the following sections — 
underlies all higher executive functions.
Keeping it all in mind
The function of the prefrontal cortex is executive because it controls the flow of 
information in other brain structures. For example, suppose a friend asks you for 
directions to a local restaurant. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex must maintain an 
auditory image of the spoken request, translate this auditory image into an image 
of the restaurant, and then, while maintaining that image, begin constructing 
images of the streets and turns between here and there. All the time you’re giving 
directions, you must maintain an image of the goal of the directions, and where 
you are in the sequence of steps.
Changing your plans
The ability to follow complex abstract goals involves making a series of decisions 
about what actions are currently appropriate for that goal, and which are not. For 
example, if you’re driving in slow traffic to an appointment and running late, one 206 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
response is to drive faster. Your frontal lobe causes you to weigh the usually minor 
problem of being late against the possibility of a speeding ticket or, worse, car 
accident. People with damage to their frontal lobes have particular trouble chang￾ing strategies according to circumstances.
Axons in the frontal lobes are the last parts of the brain to be fully myelinated 
(wrapped with a glial process, such as from an oligodendrocyte), usually not until 
early adulthood. Because the prefrontal connections are still developing, teens 
tend to be more impulsive. It’s also one reason why the teenage brain is particu￾larly susceptible to concussions.
Dialing that number: Working memory
The concept of a working memory is derived from the concept of short-term 
memory. An example of short-term memory is holding a security code number in 
mind just long enough to type it into your phone or computer.
A model for different memory stores was published by Richard Atkinson and 
Richard Shiffrin in 1968. It proposes that sensory information is processed and 
becomes stored in sensory memory for a few seconds. Sensory memory that 
attracts your attention can be transferred to short-term memory over several 
minutes. If you use and manipulate that short-term memory, it’s called working 
memory. Short-term memory that is rehearsed, relearned, or is very important 
can be transferred into a long-term memory store.
In 1974 Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch published a working memory model. It 
involves a central executive that relies on three short-term memory subsystems 
that maintain information in visual and auditory systems and retrieved from 
long-term memory. Chapter 15 describes the features of these memory models.
Most neurobiologists agree that the lateral prefrontal cortex is where working 
memory is instantiated. It’s been proposed that working memory involves rever￾berating circuits of excitatory glutamatergic neuronal activity in the neocortex 
that maintain a representation of what is to be remembered. Mechanisms pro￾posed mechanisms for working memory include short-term neuronal plasticity 
and neural oscillations.
Studies have identified neuronal activities recorded in the lateral prefrontal cortex 
that have the properties necessary for representing working memory. In a repre￾sentative experiment, a monkey was presented with an image for less than a sec￾ond. He was trained to wait until a go signal, and then he could do something 
based on the stimulus to receive a reward. Neurons recorded in the lateral pre￾frontal cortex didn’t fire during the stimulus; they only began firing when the 
stimulus was removed and continued firing the entire time until the go signal CHAPTER 11 Topping It Off: The Neocortex 207
(this was a variable interval). These neurons then stopped firing at the go signal 
when the monkey reached for the reward.
Neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex are connected with virtually the entire rest 
of the brain. Although researchers don’t know the connectivity of the neurons in 
the monkey test, the following scenario is possible: If the stimulus is a green 
square in the upper-left corner of a card, active neurons in visual cortex that code 
these properties would be set up in a reverberant circuit by the lateral prefrontal 
neurons. In this way, the prefrontal neurons controlled the existence of the mon￾key’s mental image of the green square in the upper left, while he waited through 
the interval until he could press the right key to get the reward.
Recalling long-term memory
The hippocampus is required for the encoding of long-term declarative and spa￾tial memories. Long-term memories aren’t stored in the hippocampus; instead, 
they’re stored in neocortical circuits, most likely in those cortical areas that were 
originally active in processing the stimulus that a person is remembering.
The process of creating long-term memory storage involves reciprocal activation 
between the hippocampus and cerebral cortex that occurs particularly during 
sleep. Presumably, the areas of the sensory system that were originally activated 
by the sensory input are the ones altered, but we do not, in fact, know about this 
in any detail. (Refer to Chapter  15 for more about memory, the hippocampus, 
mechanisms, and the role of sleep.)
Doing the Right Thing
Have you ever caught yourself remembering something funny, and then realized 
that you were actually laughing out loud? You probably have — everyone does — 
but wouldn’t it be awkward if that happened during a business meeting or in the 
middle of a religious service? Humans all experience various urges. Most of these 
urges are okay in some circumstances, but highly inappropriate in other circum￾stances. The next sections look at how you know which behaviors are appropriate 
and how you suppress those that aren’t.
Responding with the orbitofrontal cortex
Virtually all mammals are born fearing certain things, such as snakes, very large 
birds, spiders, and heights. Many of these fears are probably present in nonmam￾malian vertebrates as well and may be built into portions of the limbic system.208 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Other fears, however, aren’t innate and humans need to learn them, such as fear 
of exposed electric wires or a certain expression on your boss’s face. Knowing to 
avoid the dangers of complex human society requires:
» The ability to accurately represent the circumstances that present a threat
» The ability to remember the salient aspects of threat circumstances so that 
the memory will guide future behavior
In the previous section, we describe how working memory, mediated by the dor￾solateral prefrontal cortex, maintains current and past sensory input and goals, 
which allows you to carry out your plans. The orbitofrontal cortex also holds a 
kind of working memory. However, the orbitofrontal cortex is particularly con￾cerned with behavior that has a learned or social dimension with negative costs 
(embarrassment or shame, for example). It also interacts with consciousness 
indirectly by giving you something you may experience as an intuitive, gut feeling 
that something is about to go wrong.
Damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex results in the inability to alter plans or 
strategies according to circumstances. In contrast, damage to the orbitofrontal 
cortex results in the inability to inhibit inappropriate behavior. For example, 
patients with orbitofrontal damage typically engage in risky behavior such as 
gambling or unsound investments. Some tend to use excessive and inappropriate 
profanity and otherwise act in a way that makes them social outcasts. Patients 
with severe orbitofrontal damage may be unable to experience empathy for the 
pain of others, and in extreme cases, can be sociopaths.
Orbitofrontal damage also takes away a person’s ability to have a gut feeling, which 
we humans all get when experiencing the urge to do something we know is inap￾propriate given the circumstances. The orbitofrontal cortex appears to be involved 
in representing the memory of situations that may have negative outcomes, partic￾ularly social situations. The representation function of the orbitofrontal cortex 
depends on its interaction with its specific memory device, the amygdala.
Getting that bad feeling: the amygdala 
and cortical connections
The lateral prefrontal cortex holds the context of a given situation in working 
memory, so the hippocampus can encode a context-sensitive memory of the most 
important parts of an experience. Just anterior to the hippocampus is another 
limbic system component, the amygdala. The amygdala works with the orbito￾frontal cortex to learn and recall situations that warn us of negative consequences 
(refer to Chapter 10).CHAPTER 11 Topping It Off: The Neocortex 209
Patients with damaged amygdalae can have normal fear responses to intrinsically 
threatening scenarios such as snakes or heights. But they don’t learn or experi￾ence fear of things typical people learn to fear, such as risky gambling bets and 
socially inappropriate behavior. Patients with orbitofrontal damage may lack fear 
responses to things they rationally know are dangerous.
Going with your gut
The frontal lobe mediates approach-withdrawal behavior. You can think of many 
situations as things to either avoid or seek out because things to avoid have nega￾tive consequences, while things to seek out have rewards.
A left-right brain asymmetry seems to exist with approach-withdrawal behavior. 
The left prefrontal cortex appears to be approach oriented, so damage to this area 
tends to cause depression and withdrawal. The right prefrontal cortex appears to 
be withdrawal oriented, so damage to it can cause, at least in some cases, manic 
behavior.
The contrast seems to be stronger for the orbitofrontal than the prefrontal cortex. 
The orbitofrontal cortex communicates its assessment of approach-withdrawal 
judgments unconsciously, through gut feelings. This shows that emotions don’t 
just stem from some evolutionarily old part of the brain that is inferior to the 
rational portion. In fact, emotions can be the result of complexly represented, very 
real, learned experiences. Even if an emotion isn’t communicated by a rational, 
verbal thought representation, gut feelings themselves can be based on complex, 
learned representations of similar situations.
Gut feelings can tell you when your behavior in a social group is unacceptable, 
even when no one tells you. Although you aren’t aware of it, your brain is con￾stantly processing facial expressions, tones of voice, and body language of those 
around you. The orbitofrontal-amygdala system provides an intelligence that 
can’t be put into words for situations involving risks and rewards. This intelli￾gence is highly complex and certainly not a throwback to a more primitive brain.
Seeing Both Sides: The Left and 
Right Hemispheres
When you look at a human brain, you can see an obvious mirror-symmetry 
between the left and right halves. As we mention throughout this book, the left 
half of the brain tends to deal with the right side of the body and vice versa.210 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
If you look carefully at brains, although the major gyri and sulci have a consistent 
location, the locations and sizes of some minor gyri and sulci can show variation. 
Two brains almost never have totally identical patterns of gyri and sulci.
Figure  11-7 shows a view from the side of the left half of the brain (a) and a 
mid-sagittal section of the interior of the right half of the brain (b). The numbers 
correspond to regions defined by the German anatomist Korbinian Brodmann in 
the early 1900s.
Although the two brain hemispheres are nearly mirror-symmetrical in how they 
look, functional asymmetries do exist between the left and right hemispheres. 
Virtually all right-handed people (greater than 95 percent) and the majority of 
left-handed people (about 60 percent) have most of their language function on 
the left side of the brain. The right hemisphere is much more competent at han￾dling spatial skills. Since the French physician Pierre Paul Broca found language 
localized to the left hemisphere in the 1800s, neurobiologists have wondered 
about the origin and significance of left–right functional brain asymmetries.
Here we describe the two well-characterized areas of neocortex that have essen￾tial functions in language.
Specializing for language
Two areas of the brain known to be left-specialized for language are Broca’s area 
(around areas 44 and 45 in Figure 11-7) and Wernicke’s area (near the area marked 
39 in Figure 11-7). Broca’s area is in the frontal lobe, near the premotor cortex 
area that controls the speech apparatus. As its location implies, it’s particularly 
important for producing speech.
FIGURE 11-7:
Brodmann areas 
of the neocortex.

Broca’s area
Why is Broca’s area on one side only? Speech involves control of muscles like the 
tongue and vocal cords on the center line of the body, whose operation in speech 
uses symmetrical motor control on both the left and right sides. Interhemispheric 
communication is slow, making it particularly difficult to produce rapid speech. 
And given the brains’ symmetrical control aspects, one side of the brain may have 
evolved to dominate speech production.
Wernicke’s area
Wernicke’s area is at the junction of the temporal and parietal lobes, near the 
angular gyrus. This area is a high-order audio-processing region and receives 
input that starts in the primary auditory cortex (Heschl’s gyrus in mid-superior 
temporal lobe, area 41 in Figure 11-7) and passes through high-order auditory 
association cortex around the primary auditory cortex. Damage to Wernicke’s area 
doesn’t interfere with rapid speech production, but the speech produced doesn’t 
make sense. Damage to this area also compromises speech comprehension.
Interestingly, the homologous area of the right hemisphere to Wernicke’s in the 
left appears to be involved in processing meaningful intonations in speech. 
Patients with damage to this area can understand speech, but they lack the ability 
to grasp nuances like ironic and other tones of voice.
Taking in the big picture: Spatial processing
The right side of the brain appears to be superior to the left in processing visual 
imagery and visual attention. Damage to the right parietal lobe prevents people 
from paying attention to things in the left visual field. An area in the right medial 
temporal lobe called the fusiform face area is crucial for recognizing faces. Damage 
to the homologous area on the left side doesn’t affect facial recognition.
Managing with two brains in one head
Many decades ago, pop psychology was full of ideas to help you get in touch with 
the creative right side of your brain. Your right side had supposedly been repressed 
by formal education’s emphasis on left-brain language and analytical activities. 
Pop psychology also proposed that an individual’s dominant side is the basis for 
personality, skills, and vocation.
Thinking that, for example, writing poetry or fiction, a left-brain language skill, 
doesn’t involve high creativity is preposterous. Over the past decade the idea that 
people are left-brained or right-brained has been disproven. In 2013, a team of 
neuroscientists reviewed previous research along with new evidence and debunked 212 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
several previous findings. Thanks to the corpus callosum, whose axons intercon￾nect the two hemispheres, cognitive abilities, logic, and creativity involve both 
sides of the brain.
That said, lateralization and specializations do exist, and they are phylogeneti￾cally very old, appearing even in birds. Song production in songbirds relies more 
on structures in the left sides of their brains that the right. Lateral specialization 
is more extreme in humans, mostly because of language. But each side of the brain 
gives we humans unique capabilities, and we use both sides. This is an advantage, 
as we discuss in the next section.
Appreciating the style of each hemisphere
Consider what scientific evidence says about the difference between the two 
hemispheres of the brain. Some of the original findings about hemispheric asym￾metry suggested that the right hemisphere is more holistic, and the left is more 
analytical.
Holistic processing
Holistic processing deals with the big picture and categorizes by the whole. For 
example, you can recognize your friend’s face even if they shave off their mous￾tache or put on sunglasses. In fact, in a casual encounter with someone you know, 
you may not even notice these changes. The right hemisphere appears to operate 
in a case-based style of reasoning, identifying people by matching the current 
stimulus to the set of people you know.
Analytical processing
Analytical processing is rule based. It looks at particular features individually. For 
example, if you were asked to describe a stranger at a crime scene, you’d likely be 
asked to go through a set of attributes: height, weight, skin color, sex, age, and so 
forth. The police would search for their suspect based on this set of criteria.
Processing by rules
The relevance of this to brain operation is that language is a rule-based system. 
It’s a sequence of discrete words with definable meanings that get strung together 
according to rules of grammar. The word definitions and grammar types must be 
put together to extract the meaning. This is a left-brain type of skill. Some have 
argued that it’s similar to using the dominant right hand (controlled by the left 
hemisphere) to perform a sequence of specific steps to make a tool.CHAPTER 11 Topping It Off: The Neocortex 213
Remembering the layout of a scene, however, requires a more literal memory of 
spatial relationships — describing a scene isn’t easy to do using rules because you 
have to account for metrics such as distances and sizes. The holistic right brain 
seems to be able to distinguish differences between faces, or between poodles and 
terriers, even though the parts of the objects being compared are more or less the 
same, and more or less in the same locations, as one would describe using 
language.
Considering Sex and the Brain
Economist Larry Summers famously received a no confidence vote from the fac￾ulty and resigned as president of Harvard University in 2005. He controversially 
suggested that given the differences between male and female brains in mathe￾matical ability, it may be no accident that women were underrepresented in STEM 
departments. Are there differences between male and female brains? And, if so, 
what do the differences mean? Read on.
Sizing up the male and female brain
One measurable difference is average brain size. Males have an average brain vol￾ume of about 1,260 cm3; females, around 1,130 cm3. Although the brain does scale 
with physical size, the brains of males average about 100 g more than those of 
EPILEPSY AND SPLIT-BRAIN SURGERY
The split-brain operations that were performed in the late 1950s to limit epileptic sei￾zures revealed a lot about differences between brain hemispheres in humans. The 
operations involved sectioning the corpus callosum (the 200-million-axon fiber tract that 
connects the neocortex on the left with the right). At first, after the operations, the 
patients showed almost no difference in behavior, except that they had far fewer sei￾zures, the goal of the surgery.
More careful experiments showed that information about stimuli transiently presented 
to the left visual field, which goes to the right half of the brain, can’t reach the left hemi￾sphere. The split-brain subject cannot verbally say anything about the stimulus. 
However, they can point to a matching picture with their left hand, controlled by the 
informed right brain. They were also much better at solving spatial puzzles with their 
left hands, controlled by the right hemisphere, than by their right hands.214 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
females of the same body size. However, given the large variation in brain size and 
measures of intelligence, a 100 g difference wouldn’t mean any significant differ￾ence in intelligence.
Zeroing in on certain areas and 
lateralization
Sex differences are more obvious in particular brain regions. Males average greater 
volumes in the neocortex, cerebellum, and amygdala, while females average a 
larger hippocampus. Males may have a higher ratio of gray to white matter com￾pared to females. None of these differences would statistically predict significant 
differences in intelligence.
Another difference between male and female brains is the extent of lateralization 
and specialization. Imaging studies show that females display more bilateral acti￾vation while doing tasks, indicating greater connection between the hemispheres. 
Females also generally recover better than males from brain damage during 
development and strokes in adulthood that damage the brain unilaterally.
If male brains are more lateralized, then the left and right sides may be more spe￾cialized. The downside is that males are more susceptible to brain injury, but the 
upside may be some specialized skills.
Although there’s no statistical difference in average IQ between males and 
females, data show females do better than males in language skills, while males 
do better than females in visuo-spatial skills. Researchers don’t know whether 
differences result from cultural and education differences or how much is from 
inherent brain lateralization differences.
Besides verbal and spatial IQ, many other types of intelligence exist that don’t fit 
so neatly into either of those categories, such as artistic and musical abilities, 
communication, social, and emotional skills.
Knowing the role of hormones
Male and female brains show their differences because of sex-specific hormones, 
such as testosterone, estrogen, and oxytocin that affect brain development and 
function. In mammals, female is the default developmental phenotype in sexual 
differentiation. This means that without either testosterone or estrogen, the 
mammal’s body plan will develop as female. In typical male development in utero, 
a big mid-gestation surge of testosterone influences body parts and the brain.CHAPTER 12 Delving into Motor Systems Disorders 215
Chapter 12
Delving into Motor 
Systems Disorders
Neurological disorders are among the most disabling health problems in the 
United States and worldwide. Neurological disorders in which the main 
symptoms cause movement problems are referred to as motor or move￾ment disorders. Many factors can contribute to these disorders, including genetic 
abnormalities, infections, immune dysregulation, and injury that can involve 
damage of muscles, motor neurons, the spinal cord, or brain. This chapter dis￾cusses disorders of motor systems, their underpinnings where known, how they 
affect the nervous system, and how they’re treated.
Leading to Motor Disorders
Motor disorders are a subcategory of neurodevelopmental disorders. They involve 
physical disabilities in which individuals have limited function of one or more 
limbs, a disability in learning or making skilled movements, or uncontrolled or

injuries216 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
involuntary movements. During development, motor disability can occur from 
genetic disorders, infections, drug exposure, or fetal developmental accidents. 
Motor disorders can occur throughout the lifespan.
Here we describe several developmental and lifetime motor disorders.
Early motor disabilities and disorders
Motor and other dysfunctions that exist at birth or manifest shortly after are 
called congenital disorders. These can result from genetic abnormalities, infections, 
injuries, or exposure to teratogens that cause birth defects. Premature birth and 
problems during delivery can also produce motor disorders through trauma or 
oxygen deprivation. Accidents and infections can occur before, during, and after 
birth that produce motor disabilities.
About 5 percent of young children have poor motor coordination that interferes 
with performance in school, social interactions, and playing sports. We describe 
the most common developmental disorders in the next sections.
Neural tube defects
One of the most common congenital birth defects affecting the nervous system is 
the group of neural tube defects (NTDs), with an incidence of 1 per 500 births. 
NTDs occur when the neural tube fails to close completely during embryonic 
development. Chapter 3 describes neural tube development.
The most common NTD is spina bifida in which the posterior (spine) neural tube 
closure is incomplete. In spina bifida, neurosurgery can be performed to close the 
gap, and in some cases, reconstruct the spine. Many children with spina bifida 
have some degree of lower limb weakness or paralysis. For those children, physi￾cal therapy to help strengthen muscles, or the use of braces, crutches, or mobility 
devices can improve independence.
The incidence of NTDs can be decreased by up to 70 percent when the mother’s 
diet includes folic acid. Today, 81 countries worldwide have mandatory folic acid 
fortification of grain products to prevent NTDs.
Cerebral palsy
Cerebral palsy is a commonly occurring neurological motor impairment (about 
1 per 500 children). Cerebral palsy (which means paralysis or tremors) refers to 
symptoms of the disorder that can be caused by numerous factors. Cerebral palsy 
is often associated with a brain lesion that occurs prenatally — and in some cases 
may involve maternal infection.CHAPTER 12 Delving into Motor Systems Disorders 217
Different causes lead to many different manifestations of cerebral palsy. Although 
there’s no cure for cerebral palsy, treatments that include medications to relax 
muscle contractions or reduce spasticity, and physical and occupational therapies, 
can improve a child’s quality of life.
Injuries and infections
Infectious diseases and prenatal, birth, and early childhood injuries cause many 
motor disorders, including the following:
» TORCH complex: Infections which cause congenital abnormalities that can 
include motor deficits are referred to as the TORCH complex. Infections include 
toxoplasmosis, other (for example, HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B), rubella, 
cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus. Many maternal viruses can 
cross the placenta and can lead to complications such as low birth weight, 
microcephaly, and seizures, causing mental disability and coordina￾tion problems.
» Acquired brain injuries: Injuries that occur after the neonatal period but 
during childhood are referred to as acquired brain injuries. They include 
traumatic injuries such as blows to the head, weapon injuries, and injuries 
from shaking, as well as nontraumatic injuries such as tumors and infections.
Developmental brain plasticity (refer to Chapter 3) may partially alleviate symp￾toms from these injuries over time, but some motor deficits, such as poor coordi￾nation, may not fully recover.
Lifespan motor disorders
Risks for motor dysfunction increase with age. Risks includes cumulative expo￾sure to environmental toxins, declines in vascular function, nervous system 
tumors, and some genetic diseases that manifest later in life. Some genetic dis￾eases manifest in adulthood without any known environmental trigger. Other 
genetic diseases may produce susceptibility to develop motor dysfunctions that 
will manifest later depending on environmental factors.
The most well-known lifespan neurological disorder is Alzheimer’s disease (refer 
to Chapter  15). Although its earliest symptoms aren’t motor problems, later 
symptoms include loss of motor control and even compromise of the autonomic 
nervous system.218 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Failing Forces: Muscle Diseases
Neuromuscular diseases can impair muscle functioning because of pathologies in 
the muscle, motor neurons, or neuromuscular junction. These diseases usually 
manifest initially as weakness and can proceed to paresis (partial paralysis) and 
full paralysis. Many of these typically aren’t associated with cognitive, autonomic, 
or organ dysfunction until end-stage phases.
Diseases that affect the muscle directly are called primary myopathic (muscular) 
disorders. Myopathies called dystrophies are characterized by progressive muscle 
degeneration due to the muscle’s inability to repair and regenerate normally. 
Severe dystrophies begin with weakness, progress to paralysis, and can eventually 
be fatal from respiratory failure. These diseases can be congenital, usually from 
genetic abnormalities, from infections, or from the immune system attacking the 
muscle.
Muscular dystrophy
Muscular dystrophy (MD) is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness 
and the death of muscle tissue. The most severe and common form of MD is 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy that occurs in 1 per 3,500 to 6,000 boys and 1 per 
50 million girls. The Duchenne mutation is located on the X chromosome in a gene 
that codes for the protein dystrophin, a structural component of muscle tissue.
Duchenne MD symptoms usually appear in boys by age 6 with symptoms includ￾ing progressive weakness of the legs that later includes the arms. In the course of 
MD, muscle tissue degenerates. Most individuals are wheelchair dependent by age 
12, with a life expectancy of 20 to 30 years.
The FDA has approved the first recombinant gene therapy for the treatment of 
pediatric patients with Duchenne MD. It involves introducing a functional gene 
region into the cells of the individual. The gene delivered is a shortened protein 
that contains selected domains of the normal dystrophin protein.
Other types of muscular dystrophy include Becker MD, myotonic MD, and Emery￾Dreifuss MD. All types of MD predominantly affect males, but females typically 
carry the disease gene. MD also is associated with disorders in autonomic 
regulation.
Inflammatory myopathies
Inflammation of the muscles is called myositis. Chronic inflammation of the 
muscles can occur due to infection, resulting in polymyositis. This produces an CHAPTER 12 Delving into Motor Systems Disorders 219
inflammatory myopathy associated with weakness in the shoulders and hips due 
to loss of muscle mass. Myositis and polymyositis are thought to be autoimmune 
disorders, potentially triggered by viral infection.
Autoimmune disorders
In autoimmune disorders, people produce antibodies and T cells that mistake 
regions of their own (self) proteins as invaders. Protein sequences that activate 
the immune system are called antigens. This leads to a destruction of the tissue 
where the antigen is present. One hypothesis is that autoimmune disorders occur 
through molecular mimicry. A part of a protein (antigen) from an infectious 
invader (virus or bacteria) is similar to a region of a self-protein made in the body. 
Mounting an immune response against the invader also leads to an autoimmune 
attack on the body’s own protein and tissue.
Disrupting the Neuromuscular Junction
Neuromuscular junction disorders affect synaptic transmission from motor neurons 
to the muscle motor end plate, which is responsible for contracting the muscle in 
response to neurotransmitter release from the motor neuron (refer to Chapters 6 
and 7). Myasthenia gravis and Lambert–Eaton syndrome are examples of neuro￾muscular junction disorders.
The neuromuscular junction is also the target of toxins that disrupt synaptic 
transmission, several of which are used clinically to treat movement and pain 
disorders. The following sections discuss what you need to know.
Myasthenia gravis
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder having an incidence of about 
30 new cases per million people per year. The majority of MG is caused by auto￾antibodies (antibodies that recognize self-proteins as antigens) against acetylcho￾line receptors at the muscle end plate. This lowers the number and activity of the 
acetylcholine receptors, reducing the muscle response and decreasing muscle 
contraction. About 15 percent of individuals with MG also have autoantibodies 
against the muscle specific kinase MuSK.
The hallmark symptom of MG is muscle weakness that worsens with activity but 
improves with rest. Symptoms are associated with muscles that control eye move￾ment (causing eyelid drooping called ptosis), facial expressions, chewing, swal￾lowing, and speech. Respiratory and limb movements can also be affected. In a 220 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
myasthenic crisis, respiratory muscles can be paralyzed, which is life threatening 
and may require assisted ventilation.
Although MG is an autoimmune disease, the pathogen that causes it hasn’t been 
identified. Genetic susceptibility includes specific human leukocyte antigens 
(HLAs). MG is associated with abnormalities of the thymus, which produces T 
cells, and is sometimes stabilized by removal of the thymus.
MG symptoms can be alleviated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that increase 
the levels and lifetime of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. MG is also treated 
with immunosuppressant therapies. New FDA-approved biologics have been 
developed for MG. Biologics are sugars, DNA, or proteins, like monoclonal anti￾bodies that are produced in the laboratory in cells and purified. Injected biologics 
can decrease auto-antibody production in MG by targeting specific immune 
responses and cells.
Lambert–Eaton syndrome
Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMs) is an autoimmune disorder with anti￾bodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel. This leads to 
decreased release of acetylcholine and decreased muscle contraction, initially 
affecting lower limbs. LEMS is often seen in patients with small cell lung cancer. 
The FDA-approved drug diaminopyridine is a potassium channel blocker used for 
the treatment of LEMS.
Immunosuppressant drugs and biologics are used to reduce the immune response 
in autoimmune disorders. Responses to immunosuppressants can distinguish MG 
and LEMS from other myasthenic syndromes.
Neurotoxins and clinical uses
Several naturally occurring neurotoxins produced by microorganisms and animals 
can affect the neuromuscular junction. Here are some examples of toxins that 
produce inhibition of muscle contraction and paralysis:
» Botulinum neurotoxin (Botox) prevents the release of acetylcholine. Botox is 
known for cosmetic use. Its medical uses include treatment of spasticity, 
chronic migraine, cervical dystonia, and incontinence.
» Toxins in cobra snake venom block activation of the acetylcholine receptor.
» Latrotoxin from black widow spider venom depletes acetylcholine.
» Cone snail toxins (conotoxins) inhibit synaptic ion channels. Conotoxin is used 
to block pain signaling pathways.CHAPTER 12 Delving into Motor Systems Disorders 221
Toxin therapy is limited because toxins need to be injected, but their rapid and 
potent effects make toxins promising for treating spasticity and pain.
Looking At Damage to Motor Neurons
Damage to motor neurons can occur through diseases, strokes, or injuries that 
lead to either paralysis or spasticity. Damage can occur to lower alpha motor neu￾rons or upper motor neurons originating in the motor cortex or brainstem (refer 
to Chapters 7 and 8). Damage to sensory neurons can also lead to paralysis by 
eliminating feedback to the spinal cord and brain about limb position and force. 
The following addresses some of the common disorders.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease) is a debili￾tating adult-onset motor neuron disease characterized by loss of motor neurons 
in the central nervous system (CNS). Symptoms include limb weakness, and dif￾ficulty swallowing, speaking, and breathing. ALS can run in families with familial 
ALS accounting for 10 to 20 percent of all cases; the other 80 to 90 percent of cases 
are called sporadic ALS.
Both familial and sporadic ALS involve genetic components. Mutations in the 
C9ORF72 gene are present in 25 to 50 percent of familial ALS and 7 to 10 percent 
of sporadic ALS. The protein encoded by this gene regulates autophagy, the deg￾radation of cellular components, and vesicular trafficking. Variants in the super￾oxide dismutase (SOD) gene are present in 10 to 20 percent of familial ALS and 
1 to 2 percent of sporadic ALS. SOD catalyzes the breakdown of the superoxide 
radical (O2-), which is an important antioxidant function. Other genes identified 
in both familial and sporadic ALS are TARDBP, FUS, and TBK1.
Environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to ALS risk and include exposure to 
chemicals, trauma, military service, smoking, and exercise. FDA-approved drugs 
to treat ALS include riluzole, which inhibits glutamate release. Excess glutamate 
can cause glutamate excitotoxicity, where prolonged excitation of neurons leads 
to increased calcium, oxidative stress, membrane damage, and cell death.
ALS is the most common of the motor neuron diseases. Other motor neuron dis￾eases include primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive 
bulbar palsy, and pseudobulbar palsy.222 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to destruction of mye￾lin membrane sheaths that surround axons in the brain and spinal cord.
Myelin is provided by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the periph￾eral nervous system. Myelination enables rapid and reliable conduction of action 
potentials along axons. MS is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies to 
myelin proteins in CNS axons.
MS occurs more frequently in women than in men, and its onset is typically in 
early adulthood. In the US, MS occurs in about 1 in every 1,000 people. Symptoms 
begin with limb weakness, and vision and coordination problems. Symptoms can 
occur either intermittently in attacks that mitigate somewhat afterward or in a 
progressive form. In late stages of MS, degeneration of axons and motor neurons 
and cognitive dysfunction can occur.
Studies have implicated the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the virus that causes infec￾tious mononucleosis, in triggering MS in genetically susceptible individuals. One 
study examined data records from millions of military personnel and discovered 
that high levels of specific antibodies to EBV were associated with a 36-fold 
increased risk for developing MS.
Treatments for MS include immunosuppressant drugs and biologics including 
interferon beta and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).
Viral infections
Some viruses can cross the blood-brain barrier, and others gain access via the 
choroid plexus or olfactory or motor neurons. Synaptic vesicles fuse with the pre￾synaptic membrane to release neurotransmitters. This is balanced by endocytosis, 
where the plasma membrane pinches inside small vesicles called endocytic vesicles. 
Polio and rabies viruses enter motor neuron axon terminals using endocytosis.
Polio
Polio (poliomyelitis) is an infectious viral disease. After entering motor neurons, 
the virus destroys them, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. Physical therapy 
can stimulate the remaining motor neurons to sprout new axon terminals to 
recover some function. The loss of motor neurons during aging is particularly 
disabling in individuals with polio because each motor neuron that dies was doing 
a larger share of controlling muscle contraction.CHAPTER 12 Delving into Motor Systems Disorders 223
Rabies
Rabies is a viral infection that affects the nervous system, typically leading to 
brain damage and death within days. Transmitted by an infected animal bite, 
rabies virus gets to the brain through peripheral nerve axons. Rabies virus is typi￾cally fatal unless the infected animal or person receives a vaccine.
Examining Disorders of Movement
Movement disorders can involve dysfunction in the control of upper motor neu￾rons in diseases such as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob dis￾ease, as we discuss all three here. Movement can also be significantly affected by 
damage to motor neurons and their control systems following strokes and injuries 
to the brain and spinal cord.
Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is named after Dr. James Parkinson who published a 
description of it in 1817. PD involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the sub￾stantia nigra. Early symptoms of PD include rigidity, tremor, slow movement, and 
difficulty initiating movement. In later stages of PD, cognitive compromise and 
dementia may occur. The onset of PD typically occurs after age 50. The incidence 
of PD is about 1.5 cases per 1,000 individuals. Men are twice as likely to develop PD 
than women, but women often experience more severe symptoms.
Age, gender, and some insecticides (such as rotenone) are associated with 
increased risk of PD, while cigarette smoking is associated with reduced risk. 
Research also implicates metabolic processes in the gastrointestinal tract in the 
development of PD. PD-like symptoms can be produced by MPTP, a side product 
of illegal opioid drug synthesis. MPTP is metabolized to MPP+, which destroys 
dopaminergic neurons.
PD is characterized by inclusions called Lewy bodies in dopaminergic neurons. 
These contain aggregates of the protein alpha-synuclein with other proteins 
including ubiquitin and Tau. Alpha synuclein may function in the movement of 
vesicles in neurons. Mutations or variants in the alpha synuclein gene SNCA, and 
the genes PINK1, LRRK2, GBA, PARK2, PARK7, and PRKN have been identified in PD.
Dopamine is released by neurons in the substantia nigra and amplifies activity in 
the basal ganglia direct pathway to increase activation of motor pathways that will 
be executed. In the indirect pathway, dopamine enhances inhibition of nonse￾lected pathways. Decreased dopamine release in Parkinson’s disease reduces the 
ability to control movement via both direct and indirect pathways.224 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Oral dopamine can’t cross the blood-brain barrier. A metabolic precursor in 
dopamine synthesis, L-DOPA (levodopa), crosses this barrier. When taken with 
carbidopa, which prevents levodopa metabolism, it can relieve symptoms for a 
period of years. As PD progresses, dopaminergic neurons become depleted so 
supplying dopamine precursors is no longer effective.
Other drugs used for PD include dopamine-receptor agonists and inhibitors of 
monoamine oxidase. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used successfully for treat￾ing uncontrolled movement in PD. DBS involves implanting electrodes in the brain 
and a control generator in the chest, which work to provide stimulation to nuclei 
in the basal ganglia.
In later stages, PD can cause mood problems including depression, anxiety, and 
poor impulse control. These can lead to medication overuse that causes other 
psychiatric disturbances and motor complications. Some PD symptoms may be 
related to treatments that increase dopamine levels rather than primarily from PD 
itself. Risks of dementia increase in the later stages of PD.
Huntington’s disease
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that initially 
affects neurons in the striatum, producing an effect that is in some ways the 
opposite of PD. In the United States, the incidence of HD is about 1 case per 12,000 
people. The major symptom of HD is involuntary writhing movements called 
chorea, often with atypical facial expression and difficulties swallowing and speak￾ing. Late stage HD symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, cognitive 
impairment, and psychiatric problems.
HD is caused by an autosomal dominant abnormality in the huntingtin gene, with 
expansion in the gene that adds many glutamine repeats. These repeats cause neu￾rodegeneration. The function of the huntingtin protein is unknown, but it interacts 
with many other proteins. Treatment of HD includes the use of monoamine￾depleting drugs to treat chorea and antipsychotic drugs that may ease chorea, 
hallucinations, and delusions.
Geneticists can now determine if a person has the genetic abnormality that will 
develop into HD in childhood. Ethical debates about testing exist because the 
disease has no cure, though HD symptoms can be partly relieved through phar￾macological treatment.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease with 
onset occurring around age 60. Early symptoms include cognitive decline and CHAPTER 12 Delving into Motor Systems Disorders 225
poor coordination, and later symptoms include dementia. CJD is caused by mis￾folding of the prion protein, encoded by the PRNP gene. In CJD the misfolded prion 
proteins are toxic and induce the refolding of normal prion protein. The toxic 
prion proteins causes neuronal cell death.
About 85 percent of cases of CJD are sporadic, while about 7.5 percent of cases 
involve inherited mutations in the PRNP gene. Rare exposure to tissue from an 
infected person may result in infection. Most agents used to destroy infectious 
pathogens aren’t effective against toxic prions. No specific treatment for CJD has 
been developed.
Neuropathies: motor-sensory dysfunction
Peripheral neuropathy is a dysfunction of the peripheral nerves, either motor neu￾rons that innervate the muscles from the spinal cord or brainstem, or sensory 
neurons that convey touch, temperature, pain, and position information to the 
spinal cord or brain. Neuropathies may also involve autonomic innervation of 
organs and blood vessels. Peripheral neuropathies may be caused by systemic ill￾ness, infection, or trauma to the nerve.
Symptoms of neuropathy depend on which motor or sensory nerves are affected. 
Motor neuropathies can produce muscle weakness, spasms, and loss of balance or 
coordination. Sensory neuropathy can manifest as insensitivity to pain, numb￾ness, tingling, or burning sensations. Autonomic neuropathy is associated with 
involuntary function problems such as high or low heart rate and blood pressure 
and bladder and sexual dysfunction.
Peripheral neuropathies are often classified in the following two ways:
» Mononeuropathy (only one nerve involved): Common mononeuropathies 
resulting from nerve compression include carpal tunnel syndrome. 
Mononeuritis multiplex involves several noncontiguous nerves, often as a 
result of diabetes mellitus.
» Polyneuropathy (many nerves involved): This term is often synonymous 
with peripheral neuropathy. Its most frequent cause is diabetic neuropathy. 
Other causes include Lyme disease, toxins, vitamin deficiencies, and side 
effects of some prescribed drugs.
Peripheral nerve dysfunction is called neuritis, a term for nerve inflammation. 
Neuritis can develop from physical or chemical injury, radiation, overuse, or from 
infections such as herpes simplex virus, shingles, and Lyme disease.226 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Bell’s palsy
Bell’s palsy, also called acute peripheral facial palsy, is a mononeuropathy that causes 
sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. The causes of Bell’s palsy 
are unknown, but it involves inflammation of the facial nerve that controls the 
muscles on one side of the face. More than likely a viral infection triggers it. 
Symptoms typically begin to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery 
after about six months.
Paralysis can result from sensory peripheral neuropathy. Afferent sensory nerves 
convey information about limb position to the spine and brain (refer to Chapter 7). 
Diseases such as diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathies that affect sensory 
nerves. In these cases, as in strokes, patients refuse to use the limbs for which 
they did not receive sensory feedback, even though the motor systems are intact. 
Therapies such as constraint-induced (CI) therapy are often successful in allow￾ing patients to regain function of sensory deafferented limbs — by restraining the 
non-affected limb.
Focusing on Strokes and Injuries
Strokes are vascular incidents that have neurological effects via a cascade of 
events that lead to neuronal cell death. Here we describe the types, causes, effects, 
and treatments of strokes.
Experiencing a stroke
A stroke (also called a cerebrovascular accident) involves the loss of brain function 
from a disturbance in the brain’s blood supply. Strokes are the second leading 
cause of death worldwide. Stroke can cause permanent neurological damage and 
death. Age, high blood pressure, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and atrial fibrillation 
are risk factors for stroke.
The two major types of stroke are as follows:
» Ischemic strokes: Ischemic strokes are caused by a lack of blood flow 
produced by blockage, such as thrombosis (a blood clot), embolism (an 
embolus or clot arriving from elsewhere), or systemic hypoperfusion (loss of 
adequate blood supply, such as during shock). Strokes deprive brain tissue of 
adequate oxygen and glucose for metabolism.
» Hemorrhagic strokes: Hemorrhagic strokes involve bleeding in the brain, 
which leads to ischemic effects and toxic alteration of the regulated CHAPTER 12 Delving into Motor Systems Disorders 227
concentrations of ions and other substances in the extracellular space. 
Hemorrhagic strokes are often associated with the loss of consciousness 
and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure.
Stroke symptoms typically have a sudden onset, asymmetry in symptoms, and 
depend on the area of the brain affected. A stroke on the left side of the brain will 
affect the right side of the body and vice versa. Strokes on the left side of the brain 
often produce aphasia (speech difficulties) along with right-side paresis or paral￾ysis. Visual field defects are typically associated with occipital lobe damage, while 
memory deficits occur with strokes that affect the temporal lobe. Parietal lobe 
stokes, particularly on the right side, produce left visual field hemi-neglect. Fron￾tal lobe strokes impair cognitive function and produce confusion and incoherent 
thinking.
Treating strokes
A physical exam and CT scan are typically used to determine the type of stroke. For 
an ischemic stroke, if treatment can begin within three hours of symptom onset, 
the main treatment is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which breaks up the 
blood clot blocking blood flow. A physician can deliver tPA directly within the 
artery using an endovascular procedure. For a hemorrhagic stroke, surgery is used 
to control the bleeding, reduce intracranial pressure, and repair damaged arteries. 
Patients are subsequently prescribed drugs and therapies to treat the underlying 
causes of the stroke.
Injuring the brain
Brain injuries can cause damage to brain tissue that produce effects and symp￾toms similar to strokes. Brain injury from external forces is typically called a trau￾matic brain injury (TBI). The most common causes of adult TBI are violence, injuries 
from motorcycle, auto, and construction accidents, and sports. Worldwide, TBI is 
a major cause of disability.
STROKE WITHOUT SYMPTOMS
The phenomenon called “silent strokes” has been recognized via neuroimaging such 
as MRI. Patients lack outward symptoms and are typically unaware they’ve suffered a 
stroke. However, a silent stroke can still damage the brain since a sequence of silent 
strokes eventually accumulates damage that crosses a threshold for neural dysfunction. 
They also tend to precede major strokes.228 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
Imaging techniques have enhanced the ability to detect brain injuries that weren’t 
evident using early imaging modalities, including edema (swelling) and diffuse 
axonal injury to cortical white matter.
Brain areas that are particularly susceptible to injury include the orbitofrontal 
cortex and anterior temporal lobes. Damage to the prefrontal cortex can compro￾mise decision making, social behavior, and emotional regulation. Damage to 
motor control areas can produce hemiparesis (partial paralysis on one side), while 
damage to the left side of the brain can produce aphasia.
Damage to the brain from physical force is also often accompanied by a hematoma
(bleeding into the brain), with similar effects as from hemorrhagic strokes. A 
common symptom of TBI is unequal pupil size. Moderate or severe TBIs may pro￾duce persistent headaches, vomiting, convulsions, slurred speech, and aphasia, 
among other symptoms.
Sports studies show that any brain injury that is associated with even momentary 
loss of consciousness carries a significant risk of brain damage. In healthy chil￾dren and young adults, the brain may compensate well for injuries, but effects 
may accumulate past a threshold that exceeds the brain’s ability to compensate. 
Repeatedly heading a soccer ball is statistically associated with neural loss, even 
without concussion.
Severity of TBI is assessed by a CT scan and physical exam with the Glasgow Coma 
Scale. Care for moderate to severe TBI ensures the patient has sufficient oxygen 
and blood supplies, stable blood pressure, and no further injury. Surgery can 
remove blood clots and repair damaged skull fractures or blood vessels. Patients 
with severe TBI may be placed in an induced coma. Medications for TBI include 
antiseizure and anti-inflammatory drugs. Individuals with severe TBI typically 
require rehabilitation through physical, occupation, and cognitive therapies.
Injuring the spinal cord
Injury is the cause of most spinal cord dysfunction. Effects of the injury depend on 
the extent of trauma and level of the spinal cord at which it occurs. The most com￾mon causes of these are motor vehicle accidents, falls, sports, and violence. More 
than 80 percent of spinal cord injuries occur in men.
The effects of such injuries are death of neurons and glia within the spinal cord 
segment, and transection, a tear within the cord that damages or severs sensory 
and motor axons. Death of neurons at the level of the injury affects innervation of 
skin and muscles at that segment. Transection of axon tracts at a segment also 
interrupts sensory information transmitted from below that segment and motor 
commands transmitted down through that segment.CHAPTER 12 Delving into Motor Systems Disorders 229
In severe spinal injury, termed complete, a person loses all sensory and motor 
function below the injured area. Incomplete injuries have less total effect in the 
same regions. In sacral sparing, some sensation remains in sacral skin areas, even 
though sensation is lost in thoracic and lumbar skin areas. In sacral sparing, 
axons may resist compression injury through protection by the lamination of 
sacral axons within the spinal cord.
Thoracic spinal-level injuries typically result in paraplegia of the legs, but hand, 
arm, neck, and breathing functions are retained. Lumbosacral injuries decrease 
control of the legs, urinary system, and anus. Sacral spinal segment injuries com￾promise sexual function.
Severe injuries to high cervical segments can produce quadriplegia and loss of 
respiratory control. Lower cervical injuries or incomplete high injuries may allow 
some respiratory control and limited hand and arm use. Cervical injuries are also 
associated with poor autonomic regulation.
A persistent mystery about mammalian axonal injuries is that axons in the periph￾eral nervous system axons, which are myelinated by Schwann cells, can regener￾ate. In contrast, axons in the CNS, which are myelinated by oligodendrocytes, 
typically can’t regenerate.
Experimental treatments for spinal cord injuries involve transplanting Schwann 
or stem cells into damaged spinal cord, or suppression of inflammation or excito￾toxicity that offer hope for rehabilitation. For CNS injuries there are also bioengi￾neering prosthetic approaches.
Substituting Machines: Neuroprostheses
One current goal of neuroprosthesis is to restore motor function via electrical 
stimulation to overcome the loss of damaged neural components. Some studies 
have made progress in the development of neuroprosthesis to improve muscle 
strength and restore limb movement following spinal cord injury. Consider the 
following ways that motor neuroprostheses is being used:
» Functional electrical stimulation (FES): FES electrode microarrays are used 
to stimulate the efferent axons of motor neurons innervating specific muscles 
to produce movement. FES can be used to reduce impairment or in rehabilita￾tion to build up muscle strength.
» Spinal cord stimulation (SES): Controlled electrode stimulation leads to 
activation of motor neuron pools at specific spinal cord segments, which send 230 PART 2 Controlling Muscles, Movement, and Survival
action potentials out to target muscles. Studies in 2018 demonstrated that 
combining SES with intensive rehabilitation enabled independent overground 
walking in six subjects with spinal cord injuries.
» Brain computer interface (BCI): Brain-controlled neuroprosthesis, BCI 
involves implanting recording electrodes in primary motor cortex. Activity in 
the motor cortex is relayed through wires to lower motor neurons or muscles 
to control movement. Activity in the motor cortex can be recorded by EEG, 
electrocorticographic (ECoG) grids, or by intracranial electrodes.
• In recent studies with subjects with spinal cord injuries, the BCI motor 
cortex signals were transmitted past the spinal cord transection and 
directly to the spinal cord segment (as in SES) to control motor neuron 
output and muscle contraction. This has been successful in restoring upper 
limb movements and walking in a few individuals with spinal cord injury.
• In another type of BCI called BrainGate2, research participants with 
tetraplegia had microelectrode arrays implanted in their motor cortex. 
Participants used this intracortical BCI to control a commercial tablet 
computer to communicate with others via email, browse the web, play 
music using an app, and shop online.
» Neuroprostheses for speech: Development of speech neuroprosthesis for 
paralyses patients that can’t speak is underway. It works by detecting speech￾related brain signals that control the vocal cords. This requires the patient to 
wear an electrode array to capture and record activity from the speech motor 
cortex. In initial studies, up to 18 words per minute were translated with 
93 percent accuracy.
An additional outcome of neuroprosthesis is its potential beneficial effect 
to the motor system. In many incomplete spinal injuries, intact sensory and 
motor axons may remain, but their activity is below the threshold to allow 
the person to move their limb. Artificial limb movements may induce neuro￾plasticity, similar to what occurs in rehabilitation. Neuroplasticity can induce 
remaining pathways to restore enough activity to permit movement without 
the artificial aid. Without the neuroprosthesis-producing activity and move￾ment, the entire motor neuron system can degenerate from lack of activity.3

Looking At Vision 
and Hearing
You see with your eyes, and you hear with your ears, right? Well, yes, but 
without the brain, you’d never be able to look at a beautiful sunset or listen 
to a favorite song. This chapter takes a closer look at the neural responses 
involved in sight and sound.
Vision starts with the optical elements of the eye that focus light onto the retina 
at the back of the eye. There, photoreceptor cells capture photons and send infor￾mation for analysis by the visual cortex and other brain areas. The brain extracts 
from these neural images different aspects of the visual world, such as the color, 
movement, and location of edges of objects.
Audition (hearing) begins with sound waves creating signals in the inner ear for 
analysis by the auditory cortex and beyond.

Imaging and Capturing Light: Vision
The eye evolved tissues that act like the optical elements of a camera. The lens of 
the eye acts like a camera’s lens, and the pupil of the eye, which is the opening 
through which the light enters, acts like a camera’s aperture.
The cornea is the outermost clear layer at the front of the eye. The cornea does 
most of the focusing of light (about 70 percent). The lens is responsible for the 
rest of the eye’s focusing. It can change shape to adjust the focus for near and far 
objects, a process called accommodation (see Figure 13-1).
The image formed by the cornea and lens is projected onto the retina, the neural 
lining at the back of the eye. The following sections outline how the retina and 
brain convert the optical image to neural images.
Making movies on the retina
The eyes are continually moving. The eyes make large movements, called saccades,
about three to four times a second. Even during so-called fixation, in between 
saccades, the eye still makes various small movements, called microsaccades, drift,
and tremor.
Eye movement is necessary for you to see. Experiments with an apparatus that 
keeps the image from moving on the retina showed that after a few seconds all 
vision disappears. The retina adapts to constant light, and only responds to 
changes.

How do you perceive the world as stationary when the image on the retina moves? 
The answer is that the brain associates the eye movements it commands with the 
movement of the images on the retina.
The retina is part of the CNS. It develops from the neural tube region called the 
diencephalon. It has to be outside the skull because optical imaging through the 
skull bones wouldn’t work very well.
Converting through phototransduction
The human eye detects light in the visible spectrum (about 380 nm to 740 nm). 
The retina has layers of neurons and glial cells that are highly conserved across 
vertebrate evolution. Figure 13-2 shows a diagram of these layers.
Visible light is electromagnetic energy. Photons are the quantum units of light 
that are absorbed by the photoreceptor cells called rods and cones:
» Rods: Rods work in dim light and are responsible for night vision, called 
scotopic vision. Because all rods have the same absorption spectrum, you can’t 
have color vision because the signal from the rods contains no information 
about the wavelength of the photons absorbed. The human retina has about 
120 million rods.
» Cones: Cones function only in bright daylight, called photopic vision. You have 
three different cone types called red (long), green (medium), and blue (short) 
wavelength cones. Cones are responsible for high acuity and color vision. The 
brain deduces wavelength from the ratio of activity of the three different cone 
types. The human retina has about 6 million cones.

neural circuit in 
the retina.

Photoreceptors convert light into changes in electrical current through the mem￾brane. This modulates the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate.
Photoreceptors have four main structural parts:
» Outer segment: The outer segment contains rhodopsin in rods or cone opsins
in cones. These photopigments absorb photons to begin the phototransduc￾tion process. The photopigments are located in membrane disk-like struc￾tures. The outer segment also contains a high concentration of gated 
ion channels.
» Inner segment: The inner segment contains mitochondria for energy and 
machinery for transporting rhodopsin or cone opsins made in the cell body.
» Cell body: The cell body contains the nucleus and the sites where proteins are 
manufactured.
» Synaptic terminal: The synaptic terminal is where glutamate is released onto 
bipolar and horizontal cells.
Light and the transduction cascade
When a photoreceptor absorbs a photon of light, a cascade of events leads to a 
change in glutamate release to other neurons in the retina:
1. Rhodopsin is the light receptor, the photopigment in rods. There are similar 
cone opsin receptors in cones. Opsins are G protein-coupled receptors that in 
IN THE DARK: CURRENTS AND 
SYNAPTIC RELEASE
Inside photoreceptor cells in the dark, the second messenger cyclic guanosine mono￾phosphate (cGMP) is continuously synthesized by an enzyme. cGMP binds to and opens 
a channel called the cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) channel that conducts an inward 
sodium current. High cGMP levels open many CNG sodium channels in the dark. Leak 
potassium channels in the inner segment continuously produce a balancing outward 
potassium current. The dark current is the simultaneous entry of sodium in the outer 
segment and exit of potassium in the inner segment.
The dark current leads to a membrane potential in the dark of approximately –40 mV. At 
this membrane potential, voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic region are 
open that stimulates high release of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the dark.CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 237
the dark (inactivated state) have the molecule 11-cis retinal bound to them. 
When rhodopsin or cone opsins absorb a photon, this induces a transition of 
the bound 11-cis retinal to all-trans retinal, called an isomerization. This changes 
the conformation of the bound retinal and this activates the rhodopsin protein 
and its signaling cascade.
2. The activated (all-trans retinal) rhodopsin stimulates a G protein in the outer 
segment called transducin, which causes transducin to dissociate from 
guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The 
GTP-bound transducin activates the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE) that 
breaks down the cGMP into 5’-GMP.
3. cGMP promotes the opening of CNG sodium channels in the outer segment. 
Therefore, the reduction in the cGMP levels (following the photon absorption) 
closes the CNG sodium channels.
4. Closure of the CNG sodium channels decreases the sodium current leading to 
hyperpolarization of the membrane potential toward the potassium equilib￾rium potential, EK.
5. Hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor causes the presynaptic terminal, called 
the pedicle to release less glutamate. Photoreceptors don’t fire action poten￾tials. Instead, the absorption of photons continuously modulates the mem￾brane potential and release of glutamate.
6. Photoreceptor cells synapse on two types of nearby cells, called bipolar and 
horizontal cells, which we discuss in the next section.
In vertebrates, photoreceptors hyperpolarize to light. However, some inverte￾brates, like squids, have photoreceptors that depolarize to light using different 
photochemistry.
Photoreceptor adaptation
One form of light adaptation is the switch from rods in dim light to cones in bright 
light. Both rods and cones themselves adapt to light through mechanisms in their 
phototransduction cascade. These adaptational processes allow the photorecep￾tors to generate relatively large signals for changes in light level (contrast), 
instead of communicating only the absolute light level.
Photoreceptor distribution in the retina
The photoreceptor distribution (see Figure  13-3) in the retina is highly 
non-uniform.238 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Cone photoreceptors are smaller and concentrated in the central retina (called the 
macula) compared with the periphery. Within the macula is a region called the 
fovea (the central one degree of the visual field) where cone photoreceptors are 
most densely packed. Rod photoreceptors are more evenly distributed, though still 
higher in the macula than the periphery, except for the fovea, where they’re com￾pletely absent. The macula and fovea within it are responsible for central vision. 
The fovea and the cones densely packed within it provide the highest level of 
visual acuity.
Retinal pigment epithelial cells are nonneural cells located on the outermost region 
of the retina, next to photoreceptor cells. The retinal pigment epithelium func￾tions in light absorption, epithelial transport, spatial ion buffering, phagocytosis, 
secretion, and immune modulation. We discuss dysfunction of the retinal pigment 
epithelial cells in the section “Losing vision: Blindness” later in this chapter.
Joining the Nervous System: 
Photoreceptor Output
Photoreceptors release glutamate from their synaptic terminals at a synapse 
called the ribbon synapse to communicate with bipolar and horizontal cells (see 
Figure 13-2). These synapses are in a layer called the outer plexiform layer (plex￾iform is a technical word for synaptic). Here we discuss the flow of information 
from photoreceptor cells to bipolar cells and horizontal cells.
FIGURE 13-3:
Distribution of 
rods and cones in 
the retina. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 239
Converting light patterns to contrast: 
Bipolar and horizontal cells
Bipolar cells transmit the photoreceptor signal to retinal ganglion cells (called 
ganglion cells from here on). Horizontal cells modulate the signal from photore￾ceptors to bipolar cells. They are inhibitory neurons that integrate signals they 
receive from surrounding photoreceptors and provide inhibitory feedback to cen￾tral photoreceptors and bipolar cells they connect to.
Bipolar cells may have inputs from just one or a few photoreceptor cells (as occurs 
within the fovea) or from many photoreceptors (outside the fovea).
Horizontal cells compute an average light intensity received by surrounding pho￾toreceptors and subtract that level from the center photoreceptors going to each 
bipolar cell by releasing inhibitory neurotransmitter back on to photoreceptors. 
This process is called lateral inhibition. The result is more glutamate is released for 
parts of the image darker than the average and less glutamate is released for parts 
of the image brighter. This receptive field organization enhances contrast.
Making symmetry with On and 
Off bipolar cells
Two types of bipolar cells respond in opposite ways to the glutamate released by 
photoreceptors, as shown in Figure 13-2. The bipolar cell types are
» On bipolar cells: They’re depolarized by light. On bipolar cells express metabo￾tropic receptors (see Chapter 5) for glutamate that are inhibitory (called mGluR6) 
because they open nonselective cation channels. In the dark, glutamate levels are 
high and the mGluR6 receptors inhibit bipolar cells, so they’re hyperpolarized. 
Light in the center and the decrease of glutamate released by photoreceptors 
leads to less inhibition (disinhibition) of the On bipolar cells, so they become 
depolarized (excited) by light. Bipolar cells also transmit to ganglion and amacrine 
cells using glutamate. In the dark, On bipolar cells release little glutamate to their 
targets but become depolarized by light and release more glutamate.
» Off bipolar cells: They’re hyperpolarized by light because they express an 
ionotropic receptor for glutamate, called the AMPA receptor, which is excitatory 
(see Chapter 5). In the dark, high glutamate release activates AMPA receptors, 
which depolarize Off bipolar cells that then release more glutamate to their targets. 
With light, reduced glutamate release from photoreceptors leads to hyperpolariza￾tion of the Off bipolar cells, so they release less glutamate onto their target cells.
The On-Off parallel channels are maintained through ganglion cells and on to the 
thalamus.240 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Projecting with retinal ganglion cells
Bipolar cells project to ganglion cells and amacrine cells. Ganglion cells are the 
output cells from the retina, the only neurons in the retina that send axons to the 
brain. Ganglion cells project to at least 15 areas of the brain.
On and Off bipolar cells are connected to matching ganglion cells called On-center 
(On) and Off-center (Off) ganglion cells. Inside the fovea there’s one to one trans￾mission from bipolar cells to ganglion cells, but outside the fovea there’s conver￾gence of many bipolar cells onto each ganglion cell. The four main types of 
ganglion cells are as follows: 
» Parvocellular (P)
» Magnocellular (M)
» Koniocellular (K)
» Intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells
Modulating bipolar cell input to ganglion 
cells: amacrine cells
Bipolar cells also transmit to amacrine cells. Most amacrine cells are inhibitory 
neurons that function in lateral inhibition by sending feedback signals to ganglion 
cells. In addition, amacrine cells can communicate with other amacrine cells and 
ganglion cells. A specific class of amacrine cell (called AII) receives synaptic inputs 
from rod bipolar cells, which send signals to cone bipolar cells that synapse on 
ganglion cells, forming an essential link in the rod to ganglion cell pathway.
PARVOCELLULAR CELLS: COLOR AND SHAPE
The most abundant ganglion cells in mammalian retina have brisk-sustained 
responses, meaning that they have high action potential firing rates that are 
modulated by small changes in light intensity. In primate retina, these are called 
parvocellular (P) cells. These ganglion cells have small cell bodies and axons that 
connect to the parvocellular layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the 
thalamus. They code for color, shape, and fine detail. The fovea has specialized 
parvocellular ganglion cells, called midget ganglion cells. Here, a single cone pho￾toreceptor connects to one cone bipolar cell, which connects to one ganglion cell 
(though lateral interactions with horizontal and amacrine cells still occur). This 
produces the high acuity in the human fovea.CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 241
THE OTHER GANGLION CELLS: MOVEMENT 
AND LOW CONTRAST
The On and Off magnocellular ganglion (M) cells have large cell bodies and are less 
numerous than parvocellular cells. They’re selective for low contrast, motion, and 
depth of objects, but they don’t transmit color. Magnocellular cells are anatomi￾cally named parasol cells because of their size and extensive dendrites. Magnocel￾lular cell axons project to the magnocellular layer in LGN. Amacrine cell input 
contributes more to the responses of magnocellular cells than parvocellular cells.
The koniocellular ganglion cells send their axons to the koniocellular layers in the 
LGN and many other retinal targets. They mediate some aspects of color vision 
particularly for blue cones. They may have a role in integration of somatosensory 
system-proprioceptive information with visual perception.
Intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells express the photopigment melanopsin. 
They’re depolarized by light and are involved in detecting and transmitting infor￾mation about overall light levels. Their main targets are the suprachiasmatic 
nucleus in the hypothalamus for circadian rhythm and pretectum in the midbrain 
involved in the pupillary light reflex.
Covering distance with action potentials
Within the retina, the processes of photoreceptors, horizontal, bipolar, and most 
amacrine cells extend less than 1 millimeter. These distances don’t need action 
potentials. But ganglion cell axons are many centimeters long.
Increasing and decreasing action potential output
When an On ganglion cell responds to light in the center, its depolarization 
increases action potential firing and output. But when an Off ganglion cell is 
hyperpolarized by light in the center it increases in firing also. Therefore, these 
two classes of ganglion cells can provide information about light above and below 
the mean light level through increases in action potential output.
Coloring it in: Photons and color vision
Color vision requires having receptors with different spectral sensitivities (the prob￾ability of absorbing light as a function of the wavelength). That’s because the 
same molecular cascade that modulates glutamate release happens no matter 
what the wavelength of the photon that is absorbed. So, if you have only one pho￾toreceptor type, you can’t tell from its output if it responded to a small number of 
photons with a wavelength that is well absorbed or a larger number of photons 
with a wavelength less well absorbed.242 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Comparing responses from different cones
Figure 13-4 shows the rod and cone spectral sensitivity curves (the probability of 
absorbing a photon as a function of wavelength). Every wavelength results in a 
unique ratio of activity of the three cone types.
Many ganglion cells in the retina are what’s called color-opponent. The activity of 
one cone type — say, red — is opposed to the activity of another type — say, 
green — so that the ganglion cell is excited only by red light and inhibited by 
green, which is called color contrast.
Mismatching your socks: Color blindness 
and anomalies
Humans and some other primates with three cone types are called trichromats
(three colors). So, what’s special about having three cones — why not two or four? 
Most mammals and many partially colorblind humans have only two cones and 
are called dichromats (two colors). A dichromat only has good color discrimination 
in the area where the spectral sensitivities of the two cones overlap, so that the 
ratio of the outputs of the two cones changes a lot with any change in 
wavelength.

Cone spectral 
sensitivity curves.

With three cones good wavelength discrimination occurs in most of the spectrum. 
Humans and other primates appear to have developed trichromacy by splitting the 
ancestral long-wavelength cone into green and red cones, giving good color dis￾crimination for ripe red fruit against a green leafy background, among other things. 
Some vertebrates have four cone types, and some invertebrates have even more.
Humans who are missing a cone type are colorblind, although the term is a mis￾nomer because these people are only color deficient in one part of the spectrum. 
The most common colorblindness is missing a red cone (protanope) or green cone 
(deuteranope). This occurs in about one 1 in 20 men, but only one 1 in 400 women. 
The gene for the red and green cones is on the X chromosome. Because males have 
only one X chromosome, one mutation gives the defect to a male. If you’re miss￾ing the blue cone, you’re a tritanope that is much less common than red-green 
colorblindness.
Sending Messages to the Brain
An estimated 30 ganglion cell subclasses establish many parallel pathways leaving 
the retina. The human retina projects primarily to the LGN of the thalamus, which 
projects to the occipital lobe of the cortex for image analysis and conscious visual 
perception. Subcortical brain areas process unconscious aspects of visual behav￾ior. We describe some of these brain regions in the next sections.
Relaying at the thalamus
The main output of the retina responsible for conscious perception is through the 
thalamus. Figure 13-5 shows how the retinal ganglion cell axons leave each eye as 
the optic nerve, but then combine a few centimeters later at a structure called the 
optic chiasm, which means “optic crossing.” About half of the ganglion cell axons 
from each eye cross at the chiasm and go to the opposite side of the brain. About 
half don’t cross and stay on the same side.
SEEING IN DIFFERENT COLORS
Abnormal color vision occurs when a person has cones with a different spectral sensitiv￾ity than a typical person. This produces poorer color vision in most cases, but in some 
cases, it produces better color vision. Specifically, because females have two X chromo￾somes, they can be effectively a tetrachromat (four colors) if they have two different 
genes for the same cone but with different spectral sensitivities.244 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Figure 13-5 illustrates that the half of the right retina closest to the nose (the nasal 
retina) receives images from the right visual field, while the half of the right retina 
farthest from the nose (the temporal retina) receives input from the left visual field. 
At the optic chiasm, the axons rearrange so that information received from the 
nasal retina projects to the left thalamus, while the temporal retinal axons project 
to the right thalamus. A similar but opposite arrangement occurs for the left eye. 
The right thalamus receives ganglion cell axons from both eyes that see the left 
visual field, and the left thalamus receives axons that see the right visual field.
Axons leaving the optic chiasm are called the optic tracts. Unlike the optic nerve, 
each optic tract has ganglion cell axons from both eyes. The destination of about 
FIGURE 13-5:
Retinal 
projections to 
the thalamus 
and visual cortex.

80 percent of these axons is the LGN in the thalamus, while about 20 percent of 
axons travel to the midbrain or hypothalamus.
Parallel processing in visual 
centers in mammals
The most important visual destinations of ganglion cell axons are as follows:
» LGN in thalamus: This is the most important destination for image 
processing.
» Superior colliculus in midbrain: It controls eye movements for orienting the 
eyes toward stimuli of interest.
» Pretectum in midbrain: It includes the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT), 
pretectal nucleus (PO), and posterior pretectal nucleus (PP). It controls the 
pupillary light reflex. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus receives inputs from 
intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells. The pretectum coordinates eye 
movements during smooth pursuit and mediates the accommodation reflex 
by which the eye maintains focus.
» Suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus: This target receives inputs 
from intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells and controls circadian rhythms.
» Accessory optic system: It consists of several areas involved in attention, eye 
movements, and the coordination of vestibular with visual input for balance. It 
includes the medial, lateral, and terminal nucleus.
Fanning Out: From Thalamus 
to Occipital Lobe
In the LGN, each thalamic relay cell receives inputs from one or a few similar gan￾glion cells. The LGN is layered, and some layers receive inputs only from parvocel￾lular ganglion cells, whereas others receive inputs only from magnocellular 
ganglion cells.
Although the relay cells in the thalamus respond very much like their ganglion cell 
inputs, other inputs to the LGN from other parts of the brain (including visual 
cortex) allow gating functions that are associated with attention. These inputs 
modulate the strength of a neuron’s responses to any particular stimulus based on 
the context — the importance of that stimulus.246 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
The thalamic relay neurons send their axons to the visual area of the neocortex at 
the back of the brain in the occipital lobe. This fiber tract of axons leaving the LGN 
is called the optic radiation because the axons look like the axons are fanning out 
from a bundle. This pathway mediates almost all the vision of which you’re con￾scious (versus vision functions, such as control of the pupil diameter and some 
eye movements, which you’re neither conscious of nor able to voluntarily con￾trol). Here we describe the flow of visual information from the thalamus to and 
within the primary visual cortex.
Layering and concurrent processing in V1
The area of the occipital lobe that receives the input from the thalamic relay neu￾rons is called visual area 1 (V1), the primary visual cortex. It’s also referred to as 
Brodmann area 17 and striate cortex because of a dense stripe in this area that 
appears in histology.
The 1.2 million ganglion cells synapse on about the same number of LGN relay 
neurons. But the LGN neurons synapse on about 200 million cortical neurons in 
V1. V1 neuronal responses become more specialized, such as only responding to 
edges that have a certain orientation (horizontal, vertical, or other), or very spe￾cific colors. After the signal reaches V1, visual processing pathways diverge.
Selecting for orientation and movement
V1 neurons extract local visual features in a small region of the retina. V1 cells are 
almost all sensitive to the orientation of the stimulus, such as a line or an edge. 
Several ganglion cells arranged in a line and of a particular direction are activated 
to represent the image.
All stimulus orientations (vertical, horizontal, and everything in between) are 
represented in V1. And so, a small group of ganglion cells in one area of the retina 
must give rise to a much larger number of V1 cortical cells, each of which responds 
only to a particular orientation of an edge in that area.
Other V1 neurons only respond to certain directions of motion of an edge, as 
though a particular sequence of ganglion cells had to be stimulated in a certain 
order. As with orientation, all directions are encoded, each by a particular set of 
cells. Other V1 cells are sensitive to the differences between the image that the 
right eye sees compared to what the left eye sees. This binocular disparity is because 
the eyes are offset in the head and so receive offset images of the world. This cod￾ing is used for depth perception.CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 247
Area V1 is the first place in the visual hierarchy where individual neurons receive 
inputs from both eyes. Area V1 represents different extracted features in columns.
A column has a range of neurons sensitive to particular orientations and eye dom￾inance. Moving across the cortex, the orientation preference changes from verti￾cal to horizontal, then back to vertical. Neighboring columns spanning all 
orientations, and going from left to right eye dominance, are sometimes called 
hypercolumns.
Streaming the Message to the Temporal 
and Parietal Lobes
Area V1, at the posterior pole of the occipital lobe, projects to higher areas of the 
visual cortex. Just anterior to V1 is area V2, and anterior to V2 is V3. Neurons in 
these areas tend to respond in similar ways.
Virtually all the occipital lobe, much of the parietal lobe, and the inferior temporal 
lobe contain neurons that respond to specific patterns of visual inputs. After V2 
and V3 the processing stream splits into two major pathways: the ventral stream 
and the dorsal stream that have functional differences. The following sections 
discuss the flow of visual information along the ventral and dorsal streams in 
more detail.
Seeing complex shapes, colors, and 
objects in the ventral stream
The ventral stream (also called the ventral pathway) is the projection of V1-3 to the 
inferior aspect of the temporal lobe (called the infero-temporal cortex or IT). The 
ventral pathway is typically called the “what” pathway. Parvocellular ganglion 
cells via LGN relay neurons dominate this pathway.
Ventral stream neurons prefer particular patterns or colors (almost all neurons 
in ventral stream area V4, for example, are color selective). As you move in an 
anterior direction along IT, neurons respond only to increasingly complex 
patterns — such as the shape of a hand. Closer to the anterior end (pole) of the 
temporal lobe is a cortical area called the fusiform face area that contains neurons 
that respond to faces.
Damage to the fusiform face area can cause a disorder called prosopagnosia, in 
which people can’t recognize faces, even their own, to varying degrees.248 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Seeing where and how-to in 
the dorsal stream
The dorsal stream (also called the dorsal pathway) is the projection of V1-3 to the 
parietal lobe. Cortical areas in the dorsal stream include areas called middle tem￾poral (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST). Magnocellular ganglion cells are 
the primary controllers of this pathway. Neurons in these areas respond only to 
particular patterns of movement.
MST neurons respond to image movement patterns created by self-movement, 
such as tilting the head, resulting in the rotation of the entire visual field, which 
is the expanding motion pattern generated by forward movement, such as typi￾cally shown in movies for spacecraft traveling through star fields. Some dorsal 
stream respond to motion parallax, the larger shift of closer than more than distant 
objects during movement.
The dorsal stream mediates vision for actions that rely on vision, such as catching 
a ball or running through the woods without bumping into trees. Damage to this 
area results in apraxis — the inability to skillfully do visually guided tasks.
Communicating between dorsal 
and ventral streams
Despite the difference in the functions and location of the dorsal and ventral 
streams, they do converge in the frontal lobe and also communicate  — or 
crosstalk — with each other. Here are two examples:
» Deciphering structure from movement: In structure from motion experi￾ments, researchers illuminate only a few reflector spots on various body parts of 
actors otherwise in the dark. By watching the reflector motion patterns, observ￾ers can tell that the dots are on the bodies of people, what the people are doing, 
and even the people’s gender. Motion-detecting neurons from the dorsal stream 
must send information to object-analyzing neurons in the ventral pathway.
» Perceiving depth: The visual system estimates distance to objects in the 
environment using a variety of cues. Some of these cues are based on ventral 
stream analysis of patterns, such as overlap, whereas other cues involve 
movement, such as motion parallax. Ventral and dorsal pathway cues 
together create depth perception.CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 249
Losing vision: Blindness
Blindness is visual impairment in which a person has limited or no ability to per￾ceive light, shapes, or form. Various factors can cause it, including congenital 
conditions, eye diseases, injuries, or neurological factors. Blindness can be cate￾gorized into various types based on its cause and severity, and include total, par￾tial, functional, cortical, and color blindness.
Many conditions can lead to impaired vision:
» Cataracts: They’re caused by clouding of the lens and can be treated by 
surgical replacement of the lens.
» Glaucoma: This disease of the optic nerve is caused by increased intraocular 
pressure that can be controlled by drugs that reduce that pressure.
» Diabetic retinopathy: Diabetes mellitus and increased blood glucose cause 
this disorder. The leading cause of blindness in developed countries, diabetic 
retinopathy can lead to blood vessel growth, swelling of the macula, and 
scarring. It can be treated by laser surgery and with diet and drugs that 
control blood glucose levels.
» Retinitis pigmentosa (RP): RP is a group of rare genetic eye disorders that 
affect the retina’s photoreceptors. It typically begins with the loss of night 
vision in childhood, but later can affect peripheral and/or central vision from 
effects on both photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells. More 
than 60 genes have been implicated in RP. Mutations in the rhodopsin gene 
is the most common dominant form.
» Aging related macular degeneration (AMD): AMD is caused by of photore￾ceptor cells in the macula. Both genetic and environmental factors can 
contribute. This loss of vision in the center of the visual field affects the ability 
to recognize people, read, and drive.
Two types have been identified:
• Dry AMD: A buildup of the protein drusen in the macula leads to damage 
to photoreceptors. The FDA recently approved the first drugs for treating 
dry AMD.
• Wet AMD: New blood vessels intrude under the macula, causing blood 
and fluid to leak into the retina and damage photoreceptors. An effective 
therapy for wet AMD is anti-VEGF drug injections, which stop bleeding and 
leaking from blood vessels and slows vascular growth (angiogenesis).250 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Seeing without meaning: Agnosias
Agnosias are losses of specific visual abilities, usually because of damage in higher￾order areas of the visual cortex, and examples include the following:
» Blindsight: Patients with injury in V1 can make saccades to the source of a light 
or other visual stimulus without being able to consciously perceive the light.
» Pattern vision: Damage to ventral stream areas causes loss of pattern vision, 
such as facial agnosia where a person can’t recognize faces.
» Sense of color: Another well-studied ventral stream agnosia is a loss of color 
sense, called achromatopsia, due to damage to area V4 in the ventral stream. 
Unlike more common colorblindness, which comes from the retina, people 
with achromatopsia report that they can see differences between areas of 
different colors. They don’t perceive the areas as having color, but rather 
being different shades of gray.
» Motion detection: Damage to area MT in the dorsal stream causes a motion 
detection defect called akinetopsia.
» Left-sided vision: Damage to the parietal lobe, particularly on the right side 
of the brain, results in hemispatial neglect, in which people don’t see or pay 
attention to anything in their left visual field.
Sensory substitution devices are being developed that transform the representa￾tion visual sensory input into a new representation with a different sensory form 
for blind individuals. For example, a visual feed from a camera can be transformed 
into a touch stimulus, with tactile sensation that can be used for visual 
perception.
Listening In: Capturing Sound Waves
Hearing, like vision, captures energy from the environment. Your ears detect 
vibrations in the air that are created by objects vibrating in the world, which are a 
series of high- and low-pressure air pulses. Sound is the perception from receiv￾ing this energy.
The auditory system is unbelievably sensitive. The threshold for the auditory sys￾tem to detect pressure waves in the air is very close to the threshold of constant, 
random air motion itself. You can’t do much better than that. Your sense of hear￾ing allows you not only to detect that sound exists, but also what made it, what it 
means, and from where it came. In the next sections we describe how sound waves 
are converted into fluid waves.CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 251
Good vibrations: Gathering and 
transmitting sound to the brain
The auditory system has three major structures: the outer ear, middle ear, and 
inner ear. Figure  13-6 shows its anatomy. The outer and middle ears involve 
mechanical collection and transformations of sound waves to help detect and dis￾criminate sounds. The inner ear is where neurons respond to sound and produce 
a neural signal that is sent to the brain through the auditory nerve.
The auditory system starts with mechanical elements that capture, direct, and 
amplify sound.
The first mechanical transformations happen in the outer ear, which has three 
parts: 
» Pinna
» Auditory canal
» Eardrum (which transitions to the middle ear)
FIGURE 13-6:

the auditory 
system.

Tuning and directing in the outer ear
The first part of the outer ear that sound waves encounter is the pinna. The pinna
is the technical name for what is commonly called the ear. The pinna reflects 
sound waves into the auditory canal. Specifically, the pinna does two things to 
sound:
» It concentrates sound by reflecting it from the larger pinna area to the smaller 
auditory canal opening.
» It changes the frequency content of the incoming sound based on the 
elevation it came from, based on the pinna’s complex shape.
Each person’s pinna is slightly different. As you develop, you learn your own 
pinna’s directional frequency transform function to better localize sound.
The auditory canal has a resonance (at which it transmits better) at midrange 
frequencies that are important for hearing human voices. When sound reaches the 
end of the auditory canal it causes the eardrum (called the tympanic membrane) to 
vibrate. The eardrum is attached to the three bones of the middle ear.
Amplifying in the middle ear
On the other side of the eardrum from the auditory canal are three tiny bones that 
constitute the middle ear:
» Hammer (Latin name: malleus)
» Anvil (Latin name: incus)
» Stirrup (Latin name: stapes)
The vibrations of the eardrum move the attached hammer, which moves the anvil, 
which moves the stirrup, which is attached to the oval window at the entrance to 
the cochlea. We discuss the cochlea in the next section.
The hammer, anvil, and stirrup are the smallest bones in the body, and they com￾prise a lever system. The ball-like head of the hammer — where it connects to the 
anvil  — is the fulcrum in this system. An eardrum movement that has larger 
vibrations, but weaker force, causes a smaller but stronger movement of the stir￾rup. This leverage system exists because fluid in the cochlea, which is going to be 
vibrated, is stiffer than air at the eardrum.
Another mechanical advantage in this system is that the area of the eardrum 
is larger than the area of the oval window. That means the force per area is ampli￾fied by this ratio as well. The total leverage ratio of the middle ear bones and CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 253
difference in eardrum versus oval window area produces a leverage ratio roughly 
around 20 to 1.
Responding to waves with hair cells
The oval window vibrates the cochlea, which is filled with fluid. The Organ of Corti
is the structure inside the cochlea that contains the hair cells that respond to 
sound vibrations. Vibrations create pressure waves that bend the cilia on the audi￾tory hair cells in the Organ of Corti. These cilia are called stereocilia, small actin￾rich protrusions from the cell body. Bending of the cilia leads to depolarization of 
hair cells, which releases neurotransmitter onto auditory neurons that fire action 
potentials along the auditory nerve.
The stereocilia that extend into the cochlea fluid are derived — evolutionarily — 
from motor-type cilia, such as those that some single-celled organisms use to 
move. Auditory hair cells are so sensitive to small vibrations that they respond to 
deflections of their cilia by movements the size of an atom.
Transducing waves into electrical 
responses
Within the auditory inner hair cell membrane are specialized ion channels, celled 
mechanosensitive ion channels that are activated when the cilia bend. When these 
nonselective cation channels open, an influx of positive ions produces depolariza￾tion of the hair cell, which leads to a release of its neurotransmitter glutamate. 
Hair cells show a graded response to the stimulus that modulates glutamate 
release. Hair cells synapse on and release glutamate onto neurons called spiral 
ganglion neurons (or more informally, auditory neurons) that fire action potentials 
that are conducted along the auditory nerve to the cochlear nucleus in the 
brainstem.
Toning up: Frequency transduction 
in the Organ of Corti
The Organ of Corti contains two types of hair cells: inner and outer. There are 
fewer inner hair cells than outer ones, but the inner hair cells make more connec￾tions to the auditory nerve, so they generate most of the sound transduction. The 
outer hair cells function to control the stiffness of the membrane near the hair cell 
cilia. This boosts the hair cell response to low amplitude sounds, particularly at 
high frequencies, but weakens the response for very loud sounds to prevent hair 
cell damage.254 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Spiral ganglion/auditory neurons resemble — in structure — mechanoreceptors 
in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord (refer to Chapter 14). The cell body of 
the spiral ganglion auditory neurons (whose axons make up the auditory nerve) 
are in the spiral ganglion. Auditory signals from spiral ganglion/auditory nerve 
axons travel to the cochlear nucleus and onto two areas of the brainstem before 
reaching the thalamus.
The cochlea has a spiral structure that causes high-frequency vibrations to be 
concentrated near the oval window, while low-frequency vibrations travel to the 
end of the spiral. The cochlea and auditory nerve are frequency coded, such that 
different auditory fibers along the cochlea respond best to specific frequencies. 
The auditory nerve codes frequency in two ways:
» Fibers are active according to their location on the cochlea (more important 
for high than low frequencies).
» For low frequencies — fewer than 500 Hertz (Hz) — the nerves can fire at the 
frequency of the sound. This can’t occur for higher frequencies in the human 
hearing range (20 to 20,000 Hz) because neurons can’t fire action potentials 
faster than about 500 Hz. The hair cells fire at a particular phase of the sound, 
such as the peak amplitude, in a process called phase locking that is important 
for later neural circuits to determine location by interaural time difference.
Auditory fibers also code for the amplitude of the sound by the number of action 
potentials per sound wave and by having hair cells with different thresholds, so 
that some only fire to very weak or very loud sounds.
The auditory nerve has no explicit code for locating the sound source — unlike the 
retina, for example, where position on the retina corresponds precisely to visual 
field angle. Instead, in the auditory system, the auditory pathway computes the 
location of the sound in space by combining information from the two ears. This 
is something like how the visual system computes depth — not explicitly repre￾sented on the two dimensional retinas, but via binocular difference detectors in 
visual cortex.
Channeling Sounds to the Brain
The spiral ganglion/auditory nerve sends axons to the brainstem cochlear nucleus 
(dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei). From there, auditory information then goes 
to the superior olivary nucleus (superior olive), then to the inferior colliculus, and 
finally to the auditory thalamic area, called the medial geniculate nucleus. Here we 
describe how the relay of sound information is involved in localizing sound.CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 255
Comparing and relaying
Most axons from the right cochlear nucleus cross over to the superior olive nucleus 
on the left; axons from the left project to the superior olive on the right. However, 
a few axons stay ipsilateral, so that some areas in the superior olive and around it 
have binaural input. This binaural input is part of the mechanism for localizing 
sound.
Relay neurons in the superior olive project to the inferior colliculus, located just 
below the superior colliculus in the midbrain. The inferior colliculus neurons 
project to the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Virtually all the projec￾tions after the contralateral projection to the superior olive are ipsilateral. So, the 
right medial geniculate receives input mostly from the left ear, and the left medial 
geniculate receives input mostly from the right ear.
Localizing by intensity and delay comparisons
Neural comparisons between the outputs from each ear make up the neural coding 
for localizing sound. In the auditory system, neural mechanisms sensitive to the 
differences in sound volume and arrival time between the two ears mediate how 
horizontal sound is localized. Computations based on differences in arrival time 
between the two ears require precise timing, so it must occur very early in the 
auditory processing stream. Sound elevation is done primarily by the change in 
frequency content by different reflections from the pinna, as we mention in the 
section “Tuning and directing in the outer ear” earlier in this chapter.
Relaying at the medial geniculate 
nucleus of the thalamus
Medial geniculate neurons respond similarly to the responses in the auditory 
nerve. The thalamic relay for the auditory system is similar to that for vision 
described in the section “Relaying at the thalamus” earlier in this chapter. Func￾tions that gate for attention in the thalamus occur in the medial geniculate, as in 
other thalamic areas. For example, if you hear a suspicious noise, your attention 
will be drawn to that noise and other similar sounds.
Analyzing sounds: Superior temporal lobe
The medial geniculate nucleus projects to the superior temporal lobe at an area 
slightly posterior to the middle of the superior sulcus — known as Heschl’s gyrus. 
This area is called the primary auditory cortex, or A1. A1 has a tonotopic map, in 
which position on the cortical surface corresponds to the frequency to which neu￾rons respond.256 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Sound localization also is processed by neurons in A1 using subcortical timing and 
intensity comparisons. Lesions in A1 compromise the ability to locate the direction 
of a sound source.
Perceiving tones in voices and music
Around auditory area A1 are several higher-order areas, referred to as auditory 
association areas. Neurons in these areas respond best to complex or environmen￾tally relevant sounds such as chirps or rattles, rather than pure tones.
The selectivity for higher-order patterns in auditory areas is common in cortical 
processing. At lower sensory levels, most neurons respond to most stimuli — the 
neural signal is carried by a relatively small number of signals. But in the cortex, 
neurons prefer more complex patterns, and only a minority of cortical neurons 
responds to any specific sound configuration. But many more neurons are availa￾ble to parcel out this sparser representation in which similar sounds drive com￾pletely different cells. Humans achieve these specific neural responses by learning 
and experience that gives neurons the ability to differentiate complex stimuli￾based sound feature extraction.
Understanding language
Wernicke’s area is located at the border between the temporal lobe and parietal 
lobe (around Brodmann area 22). This area is crucial for processing speech. People 
with damage to Wernicke’s area have problems understanding language, and the 
language they produce is often nonsensical.
Wernicke’s area has many connections with Broca’s area, another language area 
in the frontal lobe. Broca’s area is located just anterior to the primary motor areas 
that control the tongue, vocal cords, and other parts needed for speaking. Damage 
to Broca’s area makes producing speech and understanding complex sentences 
(such as passive-voice constructions) difficult.
Both Wernicke’s area and Broca’s area are on the left side of the brain in about 
95 percent of right-handed people and about 60 percent of left-handed people. 
Damage to the brain area on the right that is mirror symmetric to Wernicke’s area 
causes problems with processing meaningful tones in spoken language  — the 
changes in tone and rhythm. People with this damage have trouble distinguishing 
sarcasm from a question.
Music is a complex stimulus for audio processing. A clinical syndrome called amu￾sia is associated with bilateral damage in higher-order auditory areas. People with 
this condition can’t recognize melodies, although they can understand speech and 
other complex sounds around them.CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 257
Losing Hearing
Hearing loss can range from complete deafness, the loss of only some frequencies, 
or some hearing loss at all frequencies.
Deafness or hearing loss can be congenital, resulting from errors in development, 
or the result of disease or damage. An impact (such as putting a cotton swab too 
far in the ear) or even a loud noise can damage the eardrum. Loud noise can also 
kill auditory hair cells. The following sections discuss the different types of hear￾ing loss and their treatments.
Conductive versus neural hearing loss
Conductive hearing loss occurs when sound vibrations aren’t mechanically trans￾mitted from the eardrum to the cochlea. Neural hearing loss is mostly due to dam￾age to the auditory hair cells, typically from loud noises. However, tumors or 
strokes that affect any part of the auditory pathway can cause neural hearing loss 
as well.
Inner ear infections can cause conductive deafness by destroying the three middle 
ear bones (refer to section “Amplifying in the middle ear” earlier in this chapter). 
Another cause of conductive hearing loss is otosclerosis, the growth of spongy 
masses on the middle ear bones. This is a hereditary conductive hearing loss that 
can happen between the ages of 15 and 40. A pregnant woman with rubella (also 
called German measles) can transmit the virus to her baby, causing the child to be 
born deaf.
Items entering the auditory canal can physically damage eardrums, as can high 
pressure, such as diving into deep water.
Eh? Aging, environment, and hearing loss
As humans age, the high-frequency sensitivity declines (presbycusis, which occurs 
in almost everyone). Young people can hear in the range of 20 to 20,000 Hertz, but 
the elderly typically hear little above 15,000 Hz.
Some age-related hearing loss is probably inevitable, but the most frequent cause 
of hearing loss in older people is due to damage to the auditory hair cells. The 
louder the noise, the more quickly it damages a person’s hearing.
Being exposed only once to very loud sounds — such as standing by the speakers 
at a concert — can cause significant hearing loss no matter your age. On the other 258 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
hand, consistently working in a loud environment such as a construction site can 
cause hearing damage that accumulates over decades.
Auditory hair cell damage is permanent.
Aiding hearing: Amplifying and replacing
Hearing aids can treat conductive hearing loss and some neural loss. Hearing aids 
amplify sound, usually matching in a complementary way the hearing loss profile. 
This is why good hearing aids are custom programmed.
If a person has severe neural loss, amplifying sound is useless because nothing is 
left to transduce it. Within the last few decades, hundreds of thousands of audi￾tory prostheses have been installed in people with profound deafness. These are 
linear sets of about 30 electrodes threaded into the cochlea to electrically stimu￾late the cochlear auditory fibers and restore some hearing. This works well because 
of the cochlea’s inherent different frequency sensitivity along its length.
Cochlear inserts can’t treat deafness that’s caused by damage higher in the ner￾vous system. Electrode arrays are being developed with the intent to implant them 
into brain structures in the auditory pathway. But so far, they’re experimental and 
not generally available.
Ringing and tinnitus
The perception of ringing in the years is called tinnitus. Chronic tinnitus is psy￾chologically debilitating. It has multiple causes that include ear infections, aller￾gies, reactions to certain drugs, and exposure to loud noise (tinnitus is common 
among rock musicians).
Muscle spasms in the ears cause objective tinnitus. The condition is diagnosed with 
special ear-specific instruments that detect the actual noise made by the spasms. 
Subjective tinnitus can’t be diagnosed objectively. It can have numerous causes and 
is typically associated with hearing loss. Tinnitus can appear suddenly and then 
disappear within a few months.
One treatment for tinnitus has people wear noise-producing earphones that mask 
the ringing sound with electronically generated white noise. In extreme cases, 
people need to have the auditory nerve surgically destroyed to get some relief, but 
this compromises normal hearing.CHAPTER 13 Looking At Vision and Hearing 259
Balancing via the Vestibular System
The vestibular system starts with the three semicircular canals and otoliths in the 
inner ear, which are sensitive to gravity and acceleration. These canals are ori￾ented in three right-angled planes. Hair cells in these canals work like nearby 
cochlear hair cells. However, instead of responding to sound vibrations, they 
respond to the movement of fluid in the cochlea that happens when you move or 
turn your head. The moving fluid acts on a structure called the cupula, which con￾tains the hair cells that convert the physical movement to vestibular nerve action 
potentials.
The semicircular canal system transduces rotational movements while the oto￾liths sense linear accelerations such as occur during the beginning of forward 
movement. The vestibular system projects to neural structures that control eye 
movements, which generates the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) — a compensatory 
eye movement that allows you to see stable images.
The three semicircular canals are called the horizontal (lateral), anterior (supe￾rior), and posterior (inferior) semicircular canals. The vestibular nuclei project to 
the cerebellum, spinal cord, thalamus, reticular formation, and the nuclei of cra￾nial nerves III, IV, and VI.  These nerves allow the muscles to compensate for 
things such as uneven terrain when running, so that you keep your balance. Some 
nuclei combine vestibular with visual signals from directionally selective ganglion 
cells that also inform the brain about rotations and translations.
The VOR stabilizes images on the retina when you move your head by producing 
an opposite, compensatory eye movement. A related reflex, called the optokinetic 
reflex (OKN), is mediated by inputs from directionally selective ganglion cells in 
the retina.
Meniere’s disease is a condition of the cochlea and semicircular canals that affects 
hearing and balance. It likely has multiple causes, but at this point the disease is 
poorly understood.CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 261
Chapter 14
Feeling, Smelling, 
and Tasting
The skin, the largest organ in the body in terms of area, is the protective bar￾rier between you and the rest of the world. You get a lot of information 
through receptors in the skin for the senses of touch, temperature, and pain 
so you can interact optimally with the physical world.
Smell and taste are senses that also tell you a lot about the world. Is that food safe 
to eat? Are you near a toxic substance? These senses also work together to create 
flavor and are strongly associated with memory.
In this chapter, we explain how these three senses work and how information 
about touch, odors, and tastes from the outside world travels in the nervous sys￾tem and projects to the brain so you can perceive them.

the skin

salt, and bitter tastes

the body262 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Getting in Touch with the Skin
You feel all sorts of different touch sensations with your skin: tickle, pressure, and 
movement. You also perceive three other important sensations: temperature, itch, 
and pain. For these different somatosensory perceptions, you have different kinds 
of skin receptors that transmit information to the brain. These sections describe 
the different types of somatosensory receptor cells and what they respond to.
Feeling your way with mechanoreceptors
The skin senses are called somatosensation. The somatosensory receptor cells in the 
skin allow you to have two senses of touch:
» Passive touch: It’s when something contacts your skin. Passive touch 
receptor cells allow you to identify this contact, such as a mosquito landing 
on your arm or the feel of the back of the chair in which you’re sitting. 
(Perhaps at this very moment?)
» Active touch: Most active touch happens with your hands and fingertips. This 
sense is precise enough that you can hold an egg in your hand without 
damaging or dropping it. Different kinds of receptor cells in the skin mediate 
the many active touch senses and skin perceptions you feel.
Humans and other mammals have four types of somatosensory receptor cells: 
» Mechanoreceptors are for the senses of touch.
» Thermoreceptors are for the senses of warm and cold temperatures.
» Pruriceptors mediate the sense of itch.
» Nociceptors are for pain sensation.
The cell bodies of all somatosensory receptor cells are located in the dorsal root 
ganglion outside the spinal cord or in sensory ganglia outside the brainstem. The 
somatosensory cell body projects an axon that immediately branches. One branch, 
the peripheral axon, extends to the skin while the other branch, the central axon, 
extends to the spinal cord or brainstem.
The axonal endings in the skin produce action potentials when they’re stimulated 
by a mechanical force, temperature, itch, or pain stimulus. The action potentials 
travel toward the soma along the peripheral axon, then proceed along the central 
axon toward the CNS. The central axon makes synapses with neurons in the spinal 
cord or brainstem for the relay to the thalamus, then on to a cortical strip in the 
parietal lobe where a somatosensory map of the body and head exists. Somatosen￾sory receptors also provide input to local reflex circuits.CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 263
Breaking down the skin’s structure
The skin has two major layers with different properties:
» Epidermis: The outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis consists of several 
layers of dead cells that provide your body with mechanical protection from 
the outside world. It also contains some live cells. At the bottom of the 
epidermis are stem cells that constantly divide, migrate outward, and die to 
replace dead layers as they wear off.
» Dermis: Below the epidermis is the dermis, the living layer of the skin that 
contains the majority of somatosensory receptor cells. Some mechano￾receptors are located close to or at the junction between the epidermis 
and dermis. The free nerve endings of temperature and pain receptor cells 
often extend into the epidermis.
By dragging your fingernail lightly along your skin, you can easily remove a layer 
or two of epidermis. It doesn’t hurt because these cells are dead, and this outer 
layer doesn’t contain pain receptor endings.
Differentiating quick touch versus pressure
Mechanoreceptors in the skin respond to various kinds of pressure. Different 
types are sensitive to different characteristics of force applied to the skin, such as 
the rate of change and intensity. Figure 14-1 shows the various types of mechano￾receptors and their locations in the dermis layer of the skin. Mechanoreceptors 
located closer to the epidermis have smaller receptive fields, whereas receptors 
located deeper in the dermis typically have larger receptive fields.
FIGURE 14-1:

in the skin.

Localizing touch
In mechanoreceptors, the endings of their peripheral axon are encapsulated by 
connective tissue or specialized cells. The four anatomical and functional types of 
skin mechanoreceptors are as follows (refer to Figure 14-1):
» Merkel disks: These disk-shaped receptor cells for pressure are located typically 
near the border between the dermis and the epidermis. The axon endings are 
surrounded by a specialized cell that detects touch. They respond to relatively 
constant pressure over small areas of the skin, as well as texture and skin motion.
» Meissner’s corpuscles: These receptors also respond to pressure over small 
areas, but they can respond to more rapid changes in pressure than Merkel 
disks. They respond to light/sensitive touch and stroking movements. The 
sensation evoked when the Meissner corpuscles are stimulated is called flutter.
» Ruffini endings: These receptors respond to cutaneous tension and skin 
stretched over large receptive fields. They’re important because they detect 
forces likely to tear the skin.
» Pacinian corpuscles: These are the fastest responding of all the touch 
receptors. Typically located deep within the dermis, they have a large connec￾tive tissue wrapping that allows them to respond to rapid changes in pres￾sure. They mediate the perception of tactile texture. If you drag your fingertips 
across a coarse surface like sandpaper, these receptors mediate how you 
perceive the coarseness of that surface.
Understanding sensory transduction in 
mechanoreceptors
When pressure or touch is applied to a mechanoreceptor, the plasma membrane 
becomes deformed, leading to the opening of mechanosensitive ion channels. 
Most mechanically gated channels are cation channels. The transient receptor 
potential (TRP) channels are a family of cationic channels that act as signal trans￾ducers in several type of sensory neurons. Different TRP channels can be activated 
by different sensory stimuli, including mechanical force, temperature, or chemi￾cals. More than 50 TRP genes having been identified.
When opened, these mechanosensitive channels allow sodium and calcium ions to 
flow into the axon. This resulting depolarization is called a receptor potential or gen￾erator potential. If the receptor potential is large enough, it triggers an action poten￾tial in the axon. The action potential is conducted along the peripheral axon and 
central axon to the spinal cord or brainstem where the presynaptic terminus releases 
glutamate at their synapses with target neurons. Mechanoreceptors may undergo 
adaptation. This reduction of the response over time allows you to ignore irrelevant 
constant stimuli and also increases the dynamic range for stimulus detection.CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 265
Employing receptor cells for temperature, 
itch, and pain
In addition to touch sensations, the skin also senses temperature, itch, and pain. 
Receptor cells for these stimuli are similar to mechanoreceptors in overall cellular 
morphology and location, but their axon terminals have free nerve endings that 
aren’t encapsulated by specialized tissues. The free nerve endings are located 
close to or in the epidermis (refer to Figure 14-1).
Responding to temperature and itch
Free nerve endings for innocuous temperature have ion channels that open in 
response to particular temperatures. Warmth receptors respond best to tempera￾ture ranges above body temperature, while cold receptors respond best to tem￾perature ranges below it. You can judge temperature quite precisely by sensing the 
unique ratio of activity of different receptor types that are activated at any partic￾ular temperature.
Members of the TRP family of gated ion channels are thermosensitive channels. 
An example is the TRPV1 channel, which is opened by temperatures between 50 
and 55 degrees C. Interestingly TRPV1 is polymodal because it can also be activated 
by the chemical capsaicin from chili peppers. That’s why eating food spiced with 
chili peppers can produce a sensation of warmth or heat in your mouth. Eating 
mint has the opposite effect – it gives the perception of coolness. Other TRP chan￾nel family members are activated by different temperatures and chemicals, 
including both innocuous and noxious heat and cold.
Pruriceptors mediate the feeling of itch. Getting a mosquito bite or coming in 
contact with poison ivy can lead to the release of chemicals, like histamine in the 
skin. Pruriceptors detect chemicals that activate ion channels that produce a 
receptor potential. Some pruriceptors can also be activated by mechanical or tem￾perature stimuli. Pruriceptors may be closely related to nociceptors, but they pro￾duce a different sensation and behavioral response.
LOSE IT AND USE IT
Active touch requires feedback from the skin, as well as position and force receptors 
in the joints and muscles. Losing feeling in a limb is so disabling that people without 
feeling from a limb refuse to use it, even if the motor neuron control circuitry is 
actually intact. A treatment called constraint-induced therapy (CIT) forces a patient 
to use their paralyzed arm while the other good arm is temporarily restrained in 
a sling. With practice patients often achieve the necessary two hand dexterity for 
common two-armed life tasks such as tying shoes.266 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Reacting to complex aspects of pain
Nociceptors are stimulated by noxious stimuli that indicate the skin has been or is 
about to be harmed. They include extreme heat and cold, intense force, and nox￾ious chemicals that contact the skin or chemicals released by tissue damage. Pain 
protects your body from injury.
Mechanosensitive nociceptors are activated by intense force. They express 
mechanically gated ion channels that produce receptor potentials.
Thermosensitive nociceptors are activated by extreme heat or cold. Chemosensi￾tive nociceptors are activated by noxious chemicals, like acids or bases that come 
in contact with the skin. This type of nociceptor can also be activated by chemicals 
that are released inside the skin by tissue damage, including bradykinin, prosta￾glandins, potassium, and substance P.
Thermoreceptors, pruriceptors, and nociceptors have neuronal morphologies that 
are very similar to mechanoreceptors (except at their endings). Different somato￾sensory neurons respond to different types of stimuli, but they all use a similar 
mechanism of sensory transduction. The stimulus leads to the opening of a gated 
ion channel, which increases the influx of cations that generate the receptor 
potential. Depolarization triggers action potentials that are conducted along the 
axons to the spinal cord or brainstem, and they release glutamate at synapses 
with target neurons.
Although pain is usually associated with something dangerous happening to a 
particular part of your body, pain can arise from other, unknown causes. Chronic 
pain that isn’t associated with any identifiable physical source can cause long￾lasting depression. The brain has no known map for pain, like the maps in the 
brain for other skin senses.
FEELING NO PAIN
Attitude and mood can strongly influence the perception of pain. Distraction or neces￾sity can cause you to ignore or not even feel pain, while anxiety can intensify the percep￾tion of pain associated with stimuli that cause it. Being able to influence pain sensation 
with the mind is well documented in cases such as soldiers ignoring significant wounds, 
yogis tolerating extreme cold, and women feeling reduced pain in childbirth from 
hypnosis.CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 267
Reducing pain with endogenous opioids
The pain system in the CNS involves a unique set of neurotransmitters in the 
modulation of pain transmission and perception. Endogenous opioids are neuro￾peptides called endorphins (“endogenous morphine”), enkephalins, and dynorphins. 
Endogenous opioids bind to opioid receptors. Located in both the brain and spinal 
cord, opioid receptors can modulate the transmission of pain signals and decrease 
pain perception.
Opioids — like morphine, heroin, oxycodone, and fentanyl — reduce pain and are 
analgesics. They work by mimicking the action of endogenous opioids. Opioid 
drugs like heroin bind the same opioid receptors and, at normal physiological 
doses, produce similar analgesic effects. When ingested in large doses, opioid 
drugs produce a high and can be addictive. The drug naloxone antagonizes the 
effects of opioids and is often given to people who have overdosed to reverse their 
life-threatening effects.
Endogenous opioids are also responsible for some types of the pain placebo effect. 
The pain placebo effect is when a patient is given an inert substance, but because 
the patient believes it’s a real drug, they perceive a decrease in pain. Naloxone 
reduces the placebo effect. The pain placebo effect isn’t just psychological; it has 
a physiological component that involves cognitive stimulation — from belief — of 
the body’s endogenous opioid production.
The endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system has also been identified 
as a key endogenous system involved in regulating pain sensation, with modula￾tory actions at multiple stages of pain processing. Endocannabinoids include 
anandamide, an unconventional neurotransmitter released during synaptic trans￾mission that activates cannabinoid receptors. The main psychoactive chemical 
derived from the marijuana/cannabis plant, delta9THC, binds to cannabinoid 
receptors and mediates its analgesic effects.
Easing pain with distraction
Cognitive distraction — focusing your mind on something else — can often reduce 
pain. The Melzack and Wall gate theory says that ordinary mechanoreceptors in 
the skin activate some of the same relay neurons in the spinal cord that receive 
inputs from pain receptors. When only pain receptors are activated, the pain sig￾nals pass through the gate and reach the brain. However, if mechanoreceptors are 
sufficiently activated, they can block the neural gate and suppress the pain signal 
to the brain. These gate neurons also receive descending inputs from cognitive 
activity (that is, by distracting yourself) that can close the pain gate.268 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Losing the pain sense
Pain is an unpleasant subjective experience with a sensory and an emotional com￾ponent. Would you be better off without it? Definitely not. Pain is necessary 
because of what happens to people who have lost this sense. For example, in 
peripheral neuropathy, pain receptors in the peripheral nervous system become 
damaged, often as a result of vascular problems associated with diabetes. People 
with peripheral neuropathy tend to injure themselves without knowing. They may 
burn themselves severely while cooking or break bones during routine physical 
activity. People who can’t feel pain can also ignore skin lesions until they become 
serious infections.
Locating your limbs with skin, muscle, 
and joint receptors
How does your brain know where your limbs are and what they’re doing? And how 
do you maintain balance and posture and coordinate movements without thinking 
about it? These senses and abilities occur through proprioception, the term for 
knowledge of limb position, while the sense of kinesthesia concerns information 
about limb movement, and both can be conscious and unconscious.
Information about limb position comes from mechanoreceptors called proprio￾ceptors located in the skin, joints, tendons, and muscles. The skin around your 
joints is stretched when your limbs move. Golgi tendon organs at the junction 
between the muscle and the tendon that attaches it to a bone report on force of 
muscle contraction. The muscle spindles send information on muscle stretch and 
extent of muscle contraction and relaxation.
Proprioceptors send information to the spinal cord or brainstem:
» For conscious proprioception the sensory signals are relayed to the thalamus 
and somatosensory cortex.
» Unconscious proprioception is relayed to the cerebellum where it’s integrated 
with other sensory and motor signals to produce motor control for posture, 
balance, and coordination.
Spinal processing and cranial nerves
Sensory input for the body is transduced by the axons of dorsal root ganglion neu￾rons that synapse in the spinal gray area or brainstem to participate in monosyn￾aptic and polysynaptic reflexes (refer to Chapter 7) and be relayed to the thalamus 
(see the next section). Sensory receptors in the skin of the head project to the CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 269
brain via cranial nerves such as the trigeminal nerve for the face, along with some 
upper cervical nerves for the back of the head (refer to Chapter 9).
Sending messages to the thalamus
Two major pathways project skin somatosensory information to the brain from 
the body below the head to the ventral posterior nucleus (VPN) in the thalamus:
» Spinothalamic tract: This tract is an evolutionary older pathway that 
contains small diameter axons. It relays sensory information from the skin to 
the brain about temperature and pain (lateral section of the tract) and coarse 
touch (anterior-ventral section of the tract). After they enter the spinal cord, 
somatosensory axons decussate (cross) and synapse with secondary neurons 
in the substantia gelatinosa or the nucleus proprius. Axons from these neurons 
travel up the spinal cord to the brainstem where some synapse on specific 
brainstem nuclei, and the majority extend to somatosensory nuclei in the VPN 
of the thalamus. The thalamic nuclei for the spinothalamic pathway project to 
the somatosensory cortex, cingulate cortex, and insula. In the spinal cord, the 
spinothalamic tract also participates in the withdrawal reflex.
» Dorsal column medial lemniscus (DCML) tract: This tract, whose axons are 
larger in diameter than the spinothalamic tract, carries discriminative (fine) 
touch and conscious proprioceptive information for active touch. The axons of 
this pathway are large in diameter and myelinated. The somatosensory axons 
enter the spinal cord and ascend up the length of the cord, forming the DCML 
tract. When the axons reach the medulla, they synapse with secondary 
sensory neurons in the cuneate and gracile nuclei. Neurons in these nuclei 
relay to the ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus in the VPN of the thalamus.
Relay from cranial nerve sensory nuclei in the brainstem occurs to the ventral 
posteromedial (VPM) nucleus in the VPN of the thalamus. In the thalamus, relay 
neuron responses are similar to their inputs from the spinal cord and cranial 
nerves. The thalamic neurons project to the primary somatosensory cortex called 
S1. Information is also transmitted to S2, the insula, and cingulate cortex.
Recognizing What You Touch at 
Somatosensory Cortex
The somatosensory area (VPN) of the thalamus projects to the narrow strip of 
cerebral cortex just posterior to the central sulcus at the most anterior part of the 
parietal lobe (see the left side of Figure 14-2). The somatosensory cortex contains 270 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
a somatotopic map. Parts of the body closest to the ground when you’re standing 
(the feet and legs) are represented most medially, while the fingers and face rep￾resentations are more lateral. The next sections describe the cortical processing of 
somatosensory information.
Mapping senses with the homunculus
The topographic map of the skin on the cortex is called the cortical homunculus. 
The term means “little man,” and the map reflects the relative positions of the 
parts of the human body. The right side of Figure 14-2 shows where major body 
areas are represented on a coronal section of the somatosensory cortex.
This map has several oddities. For example, the area of the homunculus that 
responds to stimulation of the fingers is near that for the face. Also, the homun￾culus representation on somatosensory cortex is clearly distorted. The fingers 
take up much larger areas of somatosensory cortex than, say, the skin on the 
abdomen, which is a much larger skin area.
Two principles explain the distortion in the homunculus:
» Different areas of the skin have very different receptor densities. The skin 
in the fingertip, for example, has many more receptors per area than the same 
areas in the skin on the stomach or back. This allows you to have high two￾point discrimination in your fingertips so you can manipulate objects precisely.
» A given area of cortex processes inputs from about the same absolute 
number of receptors. Because of the way the neocortex is organized, each 
area receives a similar number of inputs that are relayed by the thalamus.
FIGURE 14-2:
The somatosen￾sory cortex.

Noting specialized somatosensory areas
Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is essentially Brodmann area 3, which receives 
the largest direct thalamocortical projection, although a few direct projections 
may go to Brodmann areas 1 and 2 as well. Area 3 has been subdivided into areas 
3a and 3b. Neurons in 3b are selectively responsive to typical tactile, temperature, 
and pain stimuli, whereas neurons in 3a appear to receive proprioceptive inputs 
about joint position and muscle forces.
Brodmann areas 1 and 2 are generally now considered higher-order (association) 
somatosensory areas (S2) that receive most of their input from area 3b rather than 
directly from thalamus. Neurons in Brodmann area 1 respond to stimulation of 
Pacinian corpuscles (refer to the “Localizing touch” section earlier in this chap￾ter) that encode some aspects of texture information. Area 2 in S2 has neurons 
that are involved in active touch for determining the shape of objects.
Inputs to somatosensory cortex project into cortical layer IV.
Getting complicated with pain
The primary cortical areas that receive pain receptor projections have been diffi￾cult to locate. The spinothalamic tract ends in the VPM, VPL, intralaminar, and 
medial dorsal nuclei of the thalamus. The ventral and medial dorsal thalamic 
nuclei that receive input from pain fibers project directly to secondary cortical 
areas. Pain information from the thalamus is transmitted directly to S1 and also to 
S2, the insula and anterior cingulate cortex. The perception of pain tends to be 
associated with activity in the insula and ACC. Pain axon projections also travel to 
the lateral nucleus of the amygdala and the hippocampus. Activating the amyg￾dala is associated with immediate emotional pain responses.
Some ascending spinothalamic axons synapse on brainstem nuclei, including the 
parabrachial nucleus (PAB), rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and periaque￾ductal gray (PAG). These nuclei transmit pain information to the brain and are 
also involved in descending pain pathways. The PAG is largely responsible for 
descending modulation of pain perception. It receives inputs from the ACC, insula, 
and amygdala and has two major descending pathways involving the RVM and the 
locus coeruleus.
The somatosensory cortical areas for the hands and fingers are located close to 
areas for the face (refer to Figure 14-2). The phenomena of what’s called “phan￾tom limb” feelings (including pain) that some people experience after losing a 
limb may occur because neural projections from the face invade the neighboring 
part of the cortex that was once devoted to the limb. Face sensation that activates 
these inappropriate inputs may be interpreted as pain in the limb, even though 
the limb is no longer there.272 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Pain is also complex because psychological factors can strongly influence it. Men 
tend to be less tolerant of chronic pain than women are, though men are more 
tolerant of acute pain. Athletic training and strong motivation to obtain some goal 
can significantly reduce the disabling effects of pain. Pain tolerance generally 
increases with age. Different cultures also tend to have different levels of pain 
tolerance — cultures that encourage emotional expression typically report lower 
pain tolerance.
Sniffing Out the World around You
Whereas senses like vision and hearing require the detection of energy (light pho￾tons and sound waves), olfaction (smell) involves detecting actual chemicals, 
odors, from the world. You smell using your nose, which also filters, warms, and 
humidifies the air you breathe and analyzes that air for odors. The nose has olfac￾tory receptor cells in its roof. These neurons have cilia that stick down into the 
mucus that lines the roof of the nose that respond to different odors. Figure 14-3 
shows the location of the olfactory receptor cells in the nose and the olfactory bulb 
that we discuss a bit later.
Olfactory receptor cells are the only type of special sense neurons that contain 
both sensory dendritic endings and an axon, and they produce action potentials. 
Olfactory receptor cells have a lifespan of about 60 days and are constantly 
replaced from progenitor cells within the nasal epithelium throughout life. Olfac￾tory and taste receptor cells are the only sensory neurons that can be regenerated 
in the adult.
FIGURE 14-3:
Olfactory 
receptors and the 
olfactory bulb. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 273
Most mammals use a larger percentage of their brain for olfactory processing 
compared to humans. A dog has about 300 million olfactory neurons, compared to 
about 2.5 billion total brain neurons. Humans have 5 to 10 million olfactory recep￾tor cells in an 86 billion neuron brain. Here we describe olfactory receptor cells 
and how they transduce odor sensation.
Nosing around: Olfactory receptors
Odor molecules, also called odorants, are small volatile chemicals that pass through 
the nasal passages and dissolve in the mucus that lines it. Odorants can be classi￾fied as either pleasant or offensive, and into categories such as fragrant/floral, 
fruity, citrus, grassy, herbal, sweet, and so forth.
Olfactory receptor cells express odorant receptors on their sensory dendritic end￾ings. Odorant receptors are G protein-coupled receptors. There are about 1,000 
different odorant receptor genes, the largest receptor gene family.
Binding of odorants to odorant receptors leads to the firing of action potentials in 
the olfactory receptor cell. This occurs through a G protein and second messenger 
pathway. In mammals, odorants activate a G protein called Golf. Golf stimulates the 
enzyme adenylyl cyclase to synthesize cAMP, which is a second messenger. cAMP 
binds to and opens a cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) ion channel. Opening this 
channel produces an influx of cations leading to a depolarization of the neuron. 
The calcium influx opens a calcium-activated chloride channel, leading to an 
efflux of chloride that depolarizes the neuron and triggers an action potential in 
the axon.
Humans have approximately 1,000 different odorant receptor genes in our 
genome. Each olfactory receptor cell expresses only one type of odorant receptor. 
However, each odorant can bind to several types of odorant receptors to produce a 
unique code of olfactory receptor responses. The brain identifies the odor by com￾paring the relative activity from different olfactory receptor neurons (like color 
vision, but with much higher dimensionality).
Exploring the olfactory bulb
Olfactory receptor cells project their axons, which form the olfactory nerve, to the 
olfactory bulb in the brain, just above the back of the nose (refer to Figure 14-3). 
Within the olfactory bulb are about 1,000 to 2,000 different small zones called 
olfactory glomeruli. There, synapses form between the terminals of the olfactory 
receptor axons and the dendrites of neurons called mitral, periglomerular, and 
tufted cells.274 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Each glomerulus receives input from olfactory receptor cells expressing only 
one type of olfactory receptor. A large degree of convergence occurs, with 
approximately 25,000 axons synapsing on 25 or so mitral cells; each mitral cell 
can project dendrites to multiple glomeruli. Mitral cells also receive information 
from periglomerular cells and granular cells that inhibit the mitral cells 
surrounding it, through lateral inhibition. The mitral cell bodies and tufted cell 
bodies are located outside the glomeruli and their axons are the main outputs 
from the olfactory bulb.
Most odors that humans detect actually contain a complex mix of odors. Coffee 
aroma, for example, contains at least 100 different kinds of odor molecules, mean￾ing that the odor of coffee generates more than 100 different signatures simulta￾neously in the olfactory glomeruli. Your brain still needs to do a bit of processing 
before you can recognize what you’re drinking.
The problem of multiple odorants is mitigated somewhat by the fact that different 
odorants have different transit times across the olfactory mucosa. Each sniff pro￾duces a synchronized input to the nose so that the odorant responses are spread 
out over time. This is sometimes referred to as the chromatographic theory of odor 
perception. Proteins in the mucosa called olfactory binding proteins help some non￾soluble odorants enter and transit the mucosa to reach the receptor cilia.
Reaching the cortex and amygdala
The axonal projections from the olfactory bulb are unique among the sensory sys￾tems because they travel directly to several areas of the cortex without first relay￾ing through the thalamus. The mitral cell and tufted cell axons leave the olfactory 
bulb in the lateral olfactory tract. Mitral or tufted cell axons synapse on the pri￾mary olfactory cortex in the inferior temporal lobe. The olfactory cortex includes 
the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, periamygdaloid cortex, anterior olfactory 
nucleus, and olfactory tubercle.
Axons from the olfactory bulb also project directly to the amygdala. This connec￾tion provides an immediate emotional response to some odors before you’re con￾sciously aware of their identity. Figure 14-4 shows the main olfactory projection 
scheme (though several areas aren’t illustrated).
The olfactory bulb projects to the following areas. Most are shown in 
Figure 14-4:
» The amygdala: The amygdala mediates emotional responses to odors and 
projects to the hypothalamus to mediate hormonal responses to odors.CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 275
» The entorhinal cortex: The entorhinal cortex projects to the amygdala and 
the hippocampus, allowing you to remember odors, particularly if they were 
part of an important experience.
» The piriform cortex: The projection to the piriform (pear-shaped) cortex is an 
ancient pathway, which makes unconscious and reactive odor discrimination 
possible. The piriform cortex is allocortex lying just ventral to the amygdala 
and contiguous with the entorhinal cortex. It projects to the mediodorsal 
thalamus.
» The olfactory tubercle: This is a multisensory processing center. It plays a 
role in the integration of olfactory information with other senses, reward 
cognition, and locomotion and attentional behaviors.
» The periamygdaloid cortex: This area conducts cognitive evaluation of 
olfactory input it receives and projects back to the olfactory bulbs.
» The anterior olfactory nucleus; This nucleus is found in front of the piriform 
cortex. It plays a pivotal but relatively poorly understood role in the processing 
of odor information.
The mediodorsal thalamus is reached indirectly by relay projections from the 
olfactory cortex. This thalamic region projects to the piriform cortex and 
orbitofrontal cortex and mediates conscious odor discrimination. Some odor 
information also merges with taste here to give the perception of flavor.
Smell is different from the other senses in that smell often intrinsically generates 
an emotional response. Many smells are either immediately disgusting or dis￾pleasing (such as feces or spoiled food) or pleasing (such as flowers or chocolate 
cake). The olfactory system has an evolutionarily older pattern with a direct 
FIGURE 14-4:
Projections of the 
olfactory bulb.

projection to cortical and memory structures. This pathway mediates quick 
responses to elemental smells, such as something rotting. The amygdala is located 
anterior to the hippocampus and has a similar memory function to it (refer to 
Chapter 15), except that it processes emotionally salient memories. In the case of 
olfaction, it stores memories for which a smell was the trigger for emotional 
salience, such as the odor of a particular food before you get sick.
The amygdala projects to the olfactory thalamus and frontal lobe. The direct pro￾jections from the olfactory bulb to the amygdala appear to be part of a neural 
circuit that mediates learning associated with approach/withdrawal behavior for 
smells. A single negative incident can trigger lifelong aversion to getting sick after 
eating a particular food — even if the food isn’t spoiled.
One pathway through the mediodorsal thalamus mediates responses that depend 
on more nuanced identification of odors that requires higher-order cortical pro￾cessing to identity before being stored in a person’s memory. This is the smell 
processing that doesn’t generate an immediate limbic-like behavioral response, 
but that mediates conscious aspects of odor detection, as occurs in all other senses.
The difference between the overall anatomical structure of the olfactory system 
and other sensory systems may be due to its early evolution in mammals. Most 
mammals depend more on olfaction than primates do, and olfactory-induced 
behavior is generated directly. This is a proposed function of the limbic system 
(refer to Chapter 10). Olfactory processing that wasn’t directly linked to behavior 
happened when a phylogenetically newer thalamic pathway was created. The 
pathway was created by projections from olfactory cortex to thalamus, which then 
projects back to cortical areas.
Smelling badly versus smelling bad
Continuous exposure to noxious substances that damage the tissue can reduce or 
destroy the sense of smell. The inability to perceive odors is called anosmia and is 
most often a result of damage to the olfactory mucosa and olfactory receptors. 
Temporary anosmia typically is caused by mucosa inflammation from infections 
such as cold viruses, minor head trauma, or Covid. Olfactory neurons are among 
the few CNS cells that regenerate constantly, so receptors are always being repop￾ulated. A less than total loss of smell is called hyposmia, which can occur for spe￾cific odors.
Congenital anosmia is a lack of the sense of smell from birth, and it’s usually 
genetic. Having a greater than normal sense of smell is referred to as hyperosmia. 
Women typically have a better sense of smell than men do.CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 277
Permanent loss of smell may occur from death of olfactory receptor precursor 
neurons. Like other senses, it also can occur from damage to the olfactory nerve 
or damage to olfactory brain areas. Schizophrenia, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s 
diseases that affect the frontal lobe are sometimes associated with hyposmia or 
anosmia.
Communicating with pheromones
Smell contributes to sexual behavior both consciously and unconsciously. For 
example, the menstrual cycles of women who live together or near each other tend 
to synchronize unconsciously through smell. Odors induce an attraction toward 
other individuals, as the multibillion-dollar perfume industry proves.
The nose contains a specific organ of smell near the vomer bone called the vomer￾onasal organ. This organ appears to have receptors for human sexual odors that are 
unconsciously processed by nonthalamic odor pathways. The biological term for a 
communication odor that influences species-specific behavior in animals is a 
pheromone. Humans produce pheromone-like odors via glands similar to those in 
other mammals; these odors act on similarly located receptors, have similar cen￾tral projections, and result in similar unconscious behavioral effects.
Tasting Basics: Sweet, Sour, Salty, 
and Bitter Receptors
Humans, like all animals, must be able to discriminate between nontoxic and toxic 
plants, ripe and unripe fruit, and fresh and spoiled meat. Because what you taste 
is already in your mouth about to be ingested, you need to make these discrimina￾tions rapidly and accurately.
As taste senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic tastes are classified as 
either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have 
on your body. Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, whereas bitterness 
serves as a warning sign of poisons. These sections discuss taste receptor cells and 
mechanisms of taste sensation.
Grasping the basics of taste
Taste is the sensation produced when a chemical in the mouth activates taste 
receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity. Receptors for taste reside 278 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
mostly on the tongue in structures called papillae (see Figure 14-5) that appear as 
little bumps on the tongue. The tongue has four types of papillae: fungiform, foli￾ate, circumvallate, and filiform.
The central portion of the tongue has almost exclusively filiform papillae; taste 
doesn’t occur there (the filiform papillae don’t have taste receptors but have a 
mechanical function in some species that use rough tongues to rasp, or grate, 
ingested food). Fungiform, foliate, and circumvallate papillae contain taste recep￾tor cells. These papillae are located at the tip, sides, and back of the tongue. The 
tongue also has somatosensory receptors.
When you think of the sense of taste, you probably think of four basic tastes:
» Sweet: The sweet taste comes from receptors that respond to sugars (such as 
glucose and fructose), the source of energy for metabolism. Many human 
taste receptors respond almost exclusively to sugar.
» Salty: Salt (NaCl) constitutes the major solute in the fluid throughout the 
human body. A large number of taste receptors also respond almost exclu￾sively to NaCl salt. However, other salts, such as potassium chloride can also 
activate the same receptors.
» Sour: The sour taste is the detection of acidity, so that sour receptors react to 
protons (H+ ions). Sourness is a characteristic of foods that many people 
FIGURE 14-5:
Taste receptors 
on the tongue. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 279
enjoy, such as lemons, but it can also indicate spoilage. So, the reaction to the 
sour taste is complex and depends on learning.
» Bitter: Bitterness, like sourness, is sometimes a sign of food being unripe or 
toxic. The prototypical bitter substance is quinine. Bitterness is one of the 
most sensitive of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or 
disagreeable. You learn that the occurrence of bitter taste in some foods 
means you should avoid them, while other foods may contain bitter spices 
but are okay to eat.
In addition to the four traditional tastes, many neurobiologists now include a fifth 
basic taste, umami, a meaty, MSG-like taste that comes from the Japanese term 
meaning “savory and pleasant taste.” This receptor responds to the amino acid 
L-glutamate. Receptors may also be activated by lipids-fats, and CO2, activated by 
carbonated liquids. Refer to the section “Understanding the umami problem” for 
more about umami.
Most taste receptors respond to different tastes, and most taste buds have several 
different types of receptors. The taste buds contain about 10,000 taste receptor 
cells in total. Receptors for all the basic tastes are located in all non-filiform 
papillae types (fungiform, foliate, and circumvallate) throughout the tongue. 
However, the tongue has regional differences in the percentage of receptors, 
such as relatively enhanced taste for sweet at the front of the tongue and bitter at 
the back.
Transducing different ways
Taste receptor cells don’t fire action potentials. They communicate using a nearby 
gustatory neuron. Tastants depolarize the taste receptor cell, which stimulates the 
release of neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter for taste receptor cells is ATP 
at the synapse onto gustatory neurons.
Saltiness is produced typically by the presence of sodium ions. A sodium channel 
called ENaC in the plasma membrane allows sodium ions to enter the cell, which 
depolarizes the taste cell. Sourness is the taste that detects acidity (protons). Pro￾tons directly enter through plasma membrane proton (H+) channels, such as the 
Otop1 channel. Protons inhibit potassium channels. Together the influx of protons 
directly and indirectly depolarize the cell.
Receptors for sweet, bitter, and umami are G protein-coupled receptors that share 
a similar intracellular signaling cascade to transduce tastants. TAS1R family 280 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
members constitute the sweet and umami receptors. The TAS2Rs family members 
are the bitter receptors. Activation of the G protein leads to stimulation of the 
phospholipase C (PLC) pathway (see Chapter 5). Stimulation of PLC produces the 
second messengers DAG and IP3. IP3 releases calcium from the ER. The calcium 
activates members of the TRP channel family, TRPM5 and TRPM4, which allow 
sodium and calcium influx and depolarization of the membrane potential.
Recent research reveals a potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor, which 
is a possible lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifi￾cally, long-chain fatty acids).
Coding for taste: Labels versus patterns
Taste receptor cells control the output from gustatory neurons. The axons from 
gustatory neurons are part of the chorda tympani (a branch of the facial nerve) 
and the glossopharyngeal nerves. These nerves transmit taste information to 
brainstem nuclei, which we discuss later in this section. Some brainstem neurons 
receive inputs from similar receptors, such as salt fibers, whereas others receive a 
mix of inputs from different receptor cell types.
Certain receptors for saltiness and, to some extent, sweetness appear to be highly 
specific, so the brain can consider activation of these receptors as labeled line recep￾tors reporting the presence of salty or sweet. However, a large percentage of taste 
receptors respond to some degree to salty, sweet, sour, and bitter tastes, leaving it 
to the higher brain centers to identify taste from the ratio of receptor activation 
distributed across a number of receptors. What’s unique about taste is that the com￾bination of labeled line and distributed coding strategies exists in the same nerve.
Understanding the umami problem
The taste umami is based on receptors that are activated by L-glutamate. These 
receptors also respond to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and inosine mono￾phosphate (IMP). The perception generated when these taste receptors are acti￾vated is described as pleasant or meaty. However, the umami taste is pleasant only 
within a narrow concentration range, which also depends on the salt concentra￾tion. Some older people like the umami taste because of their generally lowered 
taste and smell sensitivity.
Although the Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda proposed umami as a basic taste in 
1908, its status was debated until the mid-1980s. The ribonucleotides GMP and 
IMP amplify the umami taste and are used to increase the palatability of many 
foods because of the synergistic effect between GMP and IMP and glutamate.CHAPTER 14 Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting 281
Tasting with the Brain
Each taste bud has five to ten taste receptor cells (Figure 14-5 shows only three), 
with most taste buds having at least one of each of the five basic receptor types. 
Taste information projects to the rostral part of the nucleus of the solitary tract 
(nucleus tractus solitarius; NTS) in the medulla. Two nerves carry this information: 
» The chorda tympani (a branch of the facial nerve) carries signals mostly from 
fungiform papillae in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.
» The glossopharyngeal nerve sends information from foliate and circumvallate 
papillae, and a few rearward fungiform papillae in the posterior third of the 
tongue.
These sections explain how taste information is transmitted from the NTS to the 
thalamus, other brain areas, and the primary taste cortex.
Projecting taste to the thalamus
The NTS projects to the thalamus, but also to the reticular formation, hypothala￾mus, and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons. Neurons projecting from the 
NST of the medulla mediate gag and cough reflexes. Figure 14-6 shows the pro￾jections for taste.
SUPERTASTERS: SUPER SENSITIVE TO TASTE
Some people are far more sensitive to taste than others and are called supertasters.
About one third of women but only 10 percent to 20 percent of men are supertasters, 
and they’re less common in Caucasians than in other ethnic groups. Besides having 
lower taste thresholds and better taste discrimination generally, supertasters have a 
heightened taste response to bitterness. This makes some supertasters picky eaters, 
but many picky eaters aren’t supertasters.
The supertaster ability is associated with several factors:
• An increased number of fungiform papillae
• The TAS2R38 gene that codes for bitter taste
• The ability to taste substances called PROP (propylthiouracil) and PTC (phenylthio￾carbamide) that have no taste to non-supertasters282 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
The taste region of the thalamus to which the NST projects is the ventropostero￾medial thalamus (VPM). Reciprocal connections between this thalamic area and 
the cortical processing areas for taste mediate conscious awareness of the taste 
sensation. Lesions in the VPM cause ageusia, the loss of the sense of taste.
Discriminating taste in the cortex
The VPM thalamus projects to the insula and frontal operculum cortex (refer to 
Figure 14-6), both of which are primary cortical taste areas. The insular lobe is 
hidden behind the temporal lobe at the junction of the parietal, frontal, and tem￾poral lobes. The opercular cortex (operculum means “lid”) is located just above 
the insula. The insula and operculum cortex are evolutionarily old and participate 
in cortical circuits that are also affected by olfaction and vision. These cortical 
areas are involved in satiety (feeling full), pain, and some homeostasis functions. 
Food texture, which is communicated by mechanoreceptors while chewing, is an 
important component of eating. Even people who congenitally lack both taste and 
smell still enjoy eating. Careful attention to food texture is part of the fare of all 
high-quality restaurants.
Combining taste and smell for flavor
The insula and opercular cortices project to the orbitofrontal cortex where some 
neurons receive inputs from the olfactory system as well. Neurons receiving both 
taste and smell information mediate the perception of flavor, the complex percep￾tion derived from a combination of taste and smell. Much of the sense of taste is 
FIGURE 14-6:

projections 
for taste.

derived from odors emitted while chewing food that reach the nasal mucosa. Most 
people are unable to identify the tastes of chocolate or coffee with their noses 
blocked, for example.
The insula and opercular cortices also project to the amygdala, which mediates 
memory for emotionally salient experiences. The amygdala projects back to the 
orbitofrontal cortex. This pathway allows you to associate the sight, smell, and 
taste of foods with your experience before and after ingesting them.
Losing taste through injuries
Although some people are born without a sense of taste (ageusia), total lack of the 
taste sense is very rare. A very poor sense of taste (hypogeusia) is more common. 
This may arise from damage to the olfactory mucosa, which is an anosmia leading 
to hypogeusia because of the involvement of smell with taste. Hypogeusia is rare 
as a congenital condition, but it may occur as a result of disease or injury to the 
chorda tympani nerve. Temporary hypogeusia often occurs during some cancer 
chemotherapies. Aging tends to reduce sensitivity to bitter tastes, which explains 
why children find some vegetables strongly bitter that are much less so to their 
parents.
Feeling full
Eating is partly controlled by satiety mechanisms that modulate the sense of taste. 
An adaption mechanism in the taste receptors themselves and a central brain 
mechanism mediate satiety:
» Sensory-specific satiety: This occurs in taste and olfactory receptors 
themselves. It tends to suppress your appetite specifically for the taste of 
what you’re consuming, acting on a fast time scale.
» Alliesthesia: This name refers to the central satiety mechanism. As you eat 
and grow full, what you’re eating loses its desirability because of the brain 
mechanism that indicates you’re getting full. The mechanism for this is seen in 
the reduced firing of orbitofrontal taste/smell neurons to the specific odor of 
a food after you’ve eaten a lot of it.
Several gastrointestinal hormones regulate appetite via their actions on the brain. 
These hormones mediate hunger and satiety that aren’t linked to specific foods. 
Gut-derived hormones include ghrelin, insulin, CCK, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), 
and peptide YY (PYY). They stimulate specific areas of the hypothalamus and 
brainstem and modify sensations transmitted by the vagus nerve to the NTS. The 
hypothalamus and brainstem control appetite via interactions with brain centers 
such as the amygdala and cortex.284 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (Glp-1) receptor agonists are an exciting topic in obesity 
research and modern culture. Developed to treat Type 2 diabetes, Glp-1 agonists 
reduce food intake, appetite, and hunger, and promote fullness and satiety with 
the result of promoting weight loss. These drugs slow the transit of food from the 
stomach into the small intestine, making you feel full faster and longer. In addi￾tion, Glp-1 works on receptors in the brain, with receptors located in the PVN, 
dorsomedial and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei, NTS and area postrema. The race is 
on to identify the mechanism of Glp-1 induced appetite suppression and develop 
oral delivery for these drugs. Intriguingly, Glp-1 agonists seem to have beneficial 
effects on other organs including the heart and brain, with potential neuroprotec￾tive effects.
Monitoring Body Functions with 
Internal Chemoreceptors
Olfaction and taste involve chemoreception, the detection of substances that enter 
the body. The body has receptors that detect concentrations of many important 
substances within it, such as glucose and CO2. Many of these receptors are in the 
hypothalamus where the blood-brain barrier is weak, allowing them to access 
neuronal receptors there. Other internal chemical detection sites include the sub￾fornical organ and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. These are 
called circumventricular organs where neurons can sense chemicals from both 
blood and CSF.
Examples of substances detected by internal chemoreceptors include osmolarity 
and sodium concentration for fluid balance. A host of other receptors exist for 
peptide hormones, such as endothelin and relaxin, angiotensin, steroids, gluco￾corticoids, and monoamine neurotransmitters noradrenaline, dopamine, and 
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine).CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 285
Chapter 15
Learning to Remember
The good thing about making mistakes is the opportunity to learn from them. 
Throughout a person’s lifetime their nervous system can learn through 
experiences and store experiences as memories to maintain and improve 
behaviors. Learning and memory influence thinking, planning, and decision 
making.
For millennia, philosophers and scientists have wondered about memory. Some of 
the mysteries about memory processes began to be solved in the last half of the 
20th century. It’s now known that memory involves multiple brain systems that 
function at different time scales and differ by the type of information being stored 
and retrieved. In addition, research has identified actual cellular and molecular 
mechanisms underlying memory. Memory can be improved with practice and 
repetition, while loss of neurons in memory regions can lead to amnesia or a slow 
decline in memory as seen with dementia. This chapter delves into the world of 
learning and memory.

Defining Learning and Memory
Memory can be defined in different ways. Exposure to the environment, experi￾ences, or even just thinking can cause changes in the nervous system. Meanwhile, 
learning is defined as the acquisition of skills or knowledge. Memory is the expres￾sion of what you’ve acquired, or a behavioral change caused by an experience. 
Memory involves the encoding, storage, and recall of information and past expe￾riences. Here we incorporate both behavioral and mechanistic views to describe 
learning and memory.
During development, the brain undergoes massive changes in neurons, synapses, 
and circuits as babies and young children interact with the environment, and their 
sensory, motor, and cognitive systems are built and refined (Chapter 2 discusses 
developmental processes). Here we keep our focus on learning and memory after 
the early developmental stages. Many of the same mechanisms and genes are 
involved in both.
ARRIVING AT MEMORY MODELS 
WITH THE HELP OF H.M.
Some of the most important studies for understanding human memory were con￾ducted for many years on one individual, Henry Molaison, a subject known widely 
before his death as patient H.M. After a bicycle accident at age 9, H.M. developed epi￾lepsy as an adolescent, with intractable seizures, (that didn’t respond to medications). In 
1953 when H.M. was in his late 20s, he underwent surgery to treat his epilepsy. The sur￾geon removed both hippocampi and surrounding cortical areas in the medial temporal 
lobe, which is where H.M.’s seizures were originating before spreading to other brain 
areas.
After the surgery, H.M.’s seizures were better controlled, but he was left with a devastat￾ing deficit. He was completely unable to permanently store new information, in a deficit 
called anterograde amnesia. Although H.M. couldn’t form new memories, he could recall 
many previously stored memories and his short-term memory was intact. In addition, 
H.M. could still improve his performance on motor tasks such as mirror writing, even 
though he had no memory of doing or practicing these tasks. Science owes a great of 
gratitude to H.M. for his willingness to be tested for so many years and for donating his 
brain to science.CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 287
The studies of Henry Molaison (see the nearby sidebar) were revolutionary because 
they showed that memory can be classified along two attributes: 
» The time course of storage
» The characteristic of the information stored
The studies demonstrated that the hippocampus is required for laying down 
memories of facts, words, and events. However, the hippocampus isn’t the site of 
permanent memory storage and isn’t needed for short-term memory or motor 
memories.
Human memory systems involve information processing and storage with 
distinct time courses. This idea was first described by the psychologist Henry 
James in 1890, who wrote about primary and secondary memory. In 1968, Richard 
Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin published the multistore memory model based on 
this concept (see Figure 15-1). The model proposes three separate memory stores. 
Each store differs in the way information is processed, how much information can 
be stored, and for how long. Information is transferred between the stores in a 
sequence, so subsequent stores depend on earlier stores.
In the model, information enters into the sensory memory register for a very brief 
time. If you focus attention on specific sensory information, it can be transferred 
to short-term memory for a minute or less. If information in the short-term store 
is important, it can be transferred or encoded into a long-term memory store. We 
describe the features of these stores in the section “Focusing on Declarative 
Memory” later in the chapter.
FIGURE 15-1:
A memory 
taxonomy.

The Atkinson Shiffrin model was groundbreaking, but it didn’t incorporate stud￾ies showing hippocampal independent long-term memory. In 1976 Dr. John 
Anderson divided long-term memory into declarative (explicit) and procedural 
(implicit) memory (see Figure 15-1).
Examining Implicit (Nondeclarative) 
Memory
The first type of memory we describe is implicit or nondeclarative memory that 
can be acquired consciously or unconsciously and typically affects behavior. 
Implicit memory includes a group of learning process for particular perceptual, 
motor and cognitive skills that are unconsciously retrieved.
Procedural memory is a form of implicit memory used every day. It lets you per￾form actions such as writing, tying a shoelace, or riding a bike, even if you aren’t 
consciously thinking about it. Procedural memory involves the cerebellum and 
basal ganglia. Other implicit memory types include non-associative and associa￾tive learning and priming.
Starting with sensation: Sensory memory
In the multi-store model, the process by which a stimulus from the environment 
becomes a memory starts with the initial neural image registered by your sensory 
system, called sensory memory. If you see someone waving a sparkler against a 
dark sky on a Fourth of July evening, you can, for a split second, see the light fol￾lowing the moving sparkler. This is called iconic memory. Other sensory modali￾ties, including sound, touch, smell, and taste are registered in sensory memory.
Sensory memory is closely linked to the perceptual domain in which it was ini￾tially registered, such as seeing the sparkler. The image that you see in your 
mind’s eye fades very rapidly, within seconds. That’s because of the decrease in 
activity of the neurons in the sensory system after the stimulus stops. Sensory 
neurons and systems can also change their responses with constant or repeated 
stimulation.
Getting used to habituation
Most sensory receptors adapt to a constant or continually repeated stimulus. For 
example, when you first sit down in a chair, you’re aware of your body touching 
the chair seat and back, but after a few minutes, your awareness of the chair fades. CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 289
Habituation is a type of non-associative learning defined as a decrease in a behav￾ioral response that results from repeated stimulation and that doesn’t involve 
sensory adaptation or motor fatigue.
Habituation allows you to be sensitive to changes in the environment and not dis￾tracted by a constant stimulus that’s no longer important. Habituation can occur 
at lower levels of sensory processing or in higher brain areas.
High-level habituation can also be reversed, which is then called dishabituation. 
Dishabituation typically results from the effect of another novel stimulus that 
reverses some of the habituation to the first, habituated stimulus.
Responding to sensitization
Sometimes your brain can learn to react to a stimulus very quickly. When you’re 
outside on July 4th, you may not notice the first few mosquitoes that land on and 
touch your legs. But after one bite, you become hypersensitive to mosquitoes and 
swat at them quickly, before they bite. This is called sensitization.
Habituation and sensitization both occur unconsciously, although the behavior 
they provoke can be realized consciously. They’re types of non-associative learning:
a change in behavior due to repetition of specific stimuli, and they occur in all 
animals.
Classical conditioning
Associative learning involves behavioral change caused by associating temporal 
relationships between stimuli and responses or motor behavior. Classical 
conditioning is a type of associative learning famously studied by Ivan Pavlov in his 
dog experiments. The experiment depends on that fact that a known pleasant or 
noxious stimulus, called the unconditioned stimulus (US), produces an appropriate 
response (approach or avoidance), called the unconditioned response (UR). For 
Pavlov, the presentation (sight and smell) of food (US) produced salivation in 
dogs (UR).
A NOBEL PRIZE FOR MEMORY RESEARCH
Non-associative learning was studied extensively by Eric Kandel and colleagues with the 
gill withdrawal response in the mollusk Aplysia californica. They demonstrated that syn￾aptic and neuronal plasticity underlie the changes in behavioral responses. Dr. Kandel 
was awarded a Nobel prize for his memory research.290 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
In the experiment, a neutral stimulus such as a tone or light is presented about the 
same time as the US (or slightly earlier). This new, initially neutral stimulus is 
called the conditioned stimulus (CS). Pavlov paired a tone (CS) with the presentation 
of food.
The US always produces the UR. When the CS is repeatedly paired with the US, it 
also comes to predict the UR.  After this conditioning, the CS elicits the same 
response that the US elicited, and the response is now called the conditioned 
response (CR).
Classical conditioning occurs naturally throughout our lives. If you answer cell￾phone calls while driving and you often almost get in accidents, you learn (hope￾fully) to associate answering phone calls with negative consequences and begin to 
avoid this behavior.
Fear conditioning
The amygdala enables you to acquire and retain lasting memories of emotional 
experiences, including fear. Some fears are innate, but fear can also be learned. 
Learned fear prepares you for behavioral, autonomic, and endocrine responses 
when a potentially dangerous situation is present.
Implicit emotional memory has been assessed in rodent experiments using Pav￾lovian fear conditioning. The presentation of an initially neutral stimulus such as 
a tone (CS) is followed by an aversive or mildly painful stimulus, such as electrical 
stimulation (US) that results in behavioral fear responses such as freezing (UR). 
Following repetitions of this pairing, the tone (CS) will elicit behavioral fear 
responses (CR-conditioned fear response).
Fear conditioning is rapid and persistent, occurs in all animals tested, and involves 
similar neural circuits in all vertebrates. Thus fear conditioning is useful for 
investigating mechanisms of implicit memory. In the amygdala, fear conditioning 
leads to modification of synaptic transmission through synaptic plasticity, which 
we discuss in section “Looking at synaptic plasticity in implicit memory” later in 
this chapter.
Operant conditioning
Operant conditioning is associative learning that involves the pairing of rewards or 
punishments with some antecedent behavior. Edward Thorndike first described it, 
and B. F. Skinner coined the term. Operant conditioning is based on spontaneous CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 291
behavior and can be considered as the formation of a predictive relationship 
between a behavior and an outcome. It can use either rewards (reinforcement) or 
punishment, each of which may be linked to positive or negative consequences of 
some behavior.
Conditioned behaviors may be lost through a process called extinction. Extinction 
results from changing the conditions so that the CS no longer predicts CR or so 
that the operant consequence associated with the previously conditioned behavior 
no longer happens.
Learning motor sequences: 
Procedural memory
Procedural memory is the acquisition of skill in performing action sequences and 
habit behaviors. It can involve conscious awareness in the initial learning and 
acquisition of the skill, but not in the performance. Procedural memory is enhanced 
by practice, repeating an action sequence until the sequence can be well executed 
without conscious awareness.
Some procedural skills don’t involve actual movement. One example is planning 
chess moves. Each chess piece moves according to certain rules. When practiced 
chess players learn the piece move sequences, they activate neural circuits in the 
cerebellum that are similar to those used for motor learning. Skillful players can 
imagine a sequence of moves using this learned neural circuitry without actually 
putting their hands on a chess piece.
A hallmark of procedural memory is the lack of conscious awareness of the steps 
that make up the overall action sequence. One model for procedural memories is 
that of a causal chain, where completion of one phase of the action sequence 
directly causes the beginning of the next phase, without voluntary intervention of 
any kind. This knowledge has been referred to as knowing how versus conscious 
types of memory that involve knowing what.
For procedural memory, the basal ganglia may encode which actions to select for 
a particular motor skill. For procedural memory, in concert with the basal ganglia, 
the cerebellum acts as a feed-forward controller that stores action sequences from 
the current state to the next state without the necessity of sensory feedback. Sen￾sory feedback is used during the learning phase for setting up the action sequence 
so that appropriate movements are made. Procedural memory involves synaptic 
plasticity changes described in the section “Looking at synaptic plasticity in 
implicit memory” later in this chapter.292 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Preparing for priming
In priming, exposure to one stimulus can influence a response to a subsequent 
stimulus without conscious guidance or intention. Subliminal advertising is a now 
banned example of priming, though it wasn’t effective. Other examples of prim￾ing are effective. If we ask you to play a word-association game and give you the 
word bank, you could come up with words related to bank either as it refers to riv￾ers or money. If before giving you the word, we showed you an image of a river, 
but so quickly that you were unaware of it, your responses to the word bank would 
be reliably biased toward river, not money, associations.
Priming involves long-term memory not because the effect of a subliminally 
flashed image (the prime) reliably lasts for a lifetime, but because the effect of a 
prime activates the long-term memory system, including your world knowledge 
semantics. The proposed mechanism is the automatic spreading of activation 
between concept modes in semantic memory. This semantic system is sometimes 
referred to as the perceptual representation system.
Focusing on Declarative Memory
Declarative memory involves the conscious or intentional retrieval of factual infor￾mation, concepts, and experiences. It’s subdivided into semantic and episodic 
memory. Semantic memory is for facts, words, and concepts. Endel Tulving first 
proposed the idea of episodic memory for events and experiences, including those 
that are autobiographical. The hippocampus and nearby cortex in the medial tem￾poral lobe are required to form new declarative memories. Memories are then 
transferred from the hippocampus to cortical brain circuits that can be accessed 
by different cues.
In the first stage of the multi-store model, information enters into the sensory 
register store. Most sensory input that activates sensory receptors in the human 
body doesn’t reach conscious awareness, and most of what reaches conscious 
awareness isn’t stored permanently in the human brain. Here we cover the char￾acteristics of sensory memory.
Fleeting sensory memories
Sensory memory refers to the perception of a picture (vision), sound sequence 
(hearing), touch, smell, or taste for a very brief time after the stimulus has stopped. 
Visual sensory memory is called iconic memory and lasts less than a second. Audi￾tory (echoic) memory appears to last longer, on the order of 2 to up to 10 seconds. 
Less is known about somatosensory (haptic), olfactory, and taste memories.CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 293
Seeing iconic memory in action
An excellent illustration of iconic memory is the Helmholtz covert memory exper￾iment. An array of 25 or more letters is flashed and the observer is told immedi￾ately after the flash to recall as many letters as possible in one location (say, upper 
right). After the observer directs their covert attention toward some portion of the 
array, they can name about seven items before the iconic neural image (iconic 
memory) has faded.
Examining short-term memory
The process of naming the letters in the Helmholtz experiment entails consider￾able processing: converting the visual image to discrete letter objects, identifying 
the letters, and associating the letters with names, in what is called semantics.
When the observer focuses attention on the sensory input, such as those semanti￾cally identified letters, a representation of the sensory memory is moved to short￾term memory. Short-term memory requires attention, has a limited capacity, and 
decays over the course of a minute or so.
Both the time course and content of short-term memory can be strengthened. If 
the letter names are rehearsed by repeating them over and over, the information 
can be remembered for as long as the rehearsal occurs, and in some cases can lead 
to it being encoded in long-term memory.
Short-term memory has a limited capacity. The commonly cited capacity of seven 
items has been superseded by four plus or minus one items. Although a person can 
remember only about four different letters, they can also remember four different 
familiar words or four short proverb-like sayings.
The content of short-term memory can be increased by the process of chunking. 
The four slots in short-term memory aren’t slots for memory items, but slots for 
memory addresses, or what computer science calls pointers. The pointer points to 
any sort of memory configuration that has an identity with learned, strongly self￾reinforcing single internal learned configurations, such as letters, words, or short 
proverb-like sayings.
Using short-term memory: 
Working memory
Humans can manipulate and use the information stored in short-term memory 
for different purposes, such as decision making, reasoning, calculating, and prob￾lem solving. This is called working memory. Working memory consciously 294 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
maintains representations of goal-directed knowledge, often maintained by 
rehearsal, and used for cognitive processes.
In 1974, Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch published a model of working memory 
that consists of subsystems and a central executive. The visuospatial sketchpad 
subsystem processes and stores visual and spatial information. The phonological 
loop subsystem processes and stores auditory and verbal information. The epi￾sodic buffer was added to the model in 2000 as a subsystem for information 
retrieved from long-term memory and that can link information across domains. 
The central executive is the supervisory system that controls attention, the flow of 
information to and from the subsystems, and cognitive functions.
Researchers think the central executive is a function of the prefrontal cortex, par￾ticularly the lateral prefrontal cortex. Working memory is proposed to involve 
persistent reverberating intrinsic circuit activity in the prefrontal cortex. The 
memory lasts for as long as activity within the circuit is maintained, even when 
the stimulus has stopped. Signaling pathways that lead to modification of neuro￾transmitter receptors may also contribute to working memory.
Addressing long-term declarative 
(explicit) memory
Sufficient rehearsal in short-term memory or the importance of information in 
working memory can promote the transfer to long term storage. Long-term 
declarative memory is typically created by conscious effort and conscious retrieval. 
But in some cases, long-term declarative memories can be formed as a result of 
emotionally salient experiences even if the brain doesn’t explicitly rehearse them.
Long-term declarative memory is integral to your understanding of the world and 
yourself, shaping your current perspective and guiding your interactions. Declar￾ative means you can talk about it in words, and you can explicitly store and retrieve 
these memories. Human declarative long-term memory has two main forms:
» Semantic memory: General world knowledge. Semantic memory is what you 
go to school to learn. It includes facts about the world in all subjects, language 
usage including word definitions, and grammar and concepts. You also have 
semantic memory for things you learn just by living.
» Episodic memory: Memories of specific events. Episodic memory contains 
source knowledge — knowledge of the time and context associated with an 
event that may also have a semantic and emotional component. Some 
episodic memory involves your own actions and experiences and is called 
autobiographical.CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 295
Episodic memory is more complex than other memories because it’s neither 
primarily association, nor is it generated by rehearsal. Instead, it involves a 
reconstruction of the entire context in which an event took place. Episodic 
memory is dependent on activity in the prefrontal cortex, particularly the 
lateral prefrontal cortex that instantiates working memory.
Spatial memory may also be considered a type of declarative memory. It allows 
you to build a cognitive map of the world, plan a route to a desired location, and 
remember where an object is located or where an event occurred.
Long-term memory is characterized by having a very large capacity and can 
involve lifelong storage and retrieval. Encoding involves biochemical and mor￾phological changes to synapses and neurons.
Examining Brain Regions and 
Memory Mechanisms
A short-term memory can become a long-term memory through the process of 
encoding. It’s the job of the hippocampus to encode declarative and spatial mem￾ories. The hippocampus then transmits the encoded information back to circuits 
in the cerebral cortex for long-term storage. Here we explain how information is 
transmitted into, out of, and within the hippocampus.
Associating context with results 
in the hippocampus
Short-term memory typically involves initial activity in a sensory input system. 
High-level processing that leads to semantic item identification generates activity 
in the lateral prefrontal cortex. This brain area maintains an internal representa￾tion of the input after the stimulus has ended. The lateral prefrontal cortex also 
maintains other aspects of the current context, such as your goals and what you 
were doing prior to that moment.
Inputting to the hippocampus
A region adjacent to the hippocampus, called the entorhinal cortex, provides the 
majority of direct inputs to the hippocampus. The entorhinal cortex receives 
information from many cortical and subcortical areas about what’s going on in 
the current situation. The hippocampus also receives direct inputs from the basal 
forebrain and the brainstem.296 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Remembering an episode involves reconstructing the salient aspects of the event. 
Memory involves storing the patterns of brain activity associated with the event 
so that the event and its context can be reproduced. Both the direct sensory rep￾resentation of inputs and their internal representation in lateral prefrontal cortex 
and the amygdala provide input information, via the entorhinal cortex, to the hip￾pocampus. The hippocampus then creates the records of the events.
Understanding the intrinsic 
hippocampal circuit
The main input tract to the hippocampus is the perforant pathway, where neurons 
in the entorhinal cortex project their axons to dentate granule neurons in the den￾tate gyrus. The dentate granule neurons project axons called mossy fibers to CA3 
pyramidal neurons. CA3 pyramidal neurons project axons called Shaffer collaterals
to CA1 pyramidal neurons. The main output from the hippocampus is from CA1 to 
the subiculum, which projects back to the entorhinal cortex, and with other out￾puts to prefrontal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and amygdala (see Figure 15-2).
In the hippocampus, the granule and pyramidal neurons are glutamatergic neu￾rons, and the majority of the synapses are excitatory synapses on dendritic spines. 
GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus regulate the output from 
the excitatory neurons.

outputs from the 
hippocampus.

Looking at memory through 
changes in synapses
Synaptic plasticity is the modulation of synaptic strength, where synapses become 
stronger or weaker over time. Synaptic plasticity has been documented in a variety 
of learning-associated brain areas including the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, 
cerebellum, amygdala, and striatum.
The synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis asserts that activity-dependent 
synaptic plasticity is induced at synapses during memory encoding. It’s necessary 
and sufficient for the encoding and storage of the type of memory mediated by the 
brain area in which it’s observed.
Discovering synaptic plasticity: LTP
Timothy Bliss and Terje Lomo discovered synaptic plasticity in the rabbit hippo￾campus in the 1970s. They stimulated axons in the perforant path from the ento￾rhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus with electrodes and measured postsynaptic 
response in dentate granule neurons (refer to Figure 15-2). They observed that 
following a short burst of high frequency tetanic stimulation (100  Hz) of the 
axons, there was a large and long-lasting increase in the postsynaptic responses 
of the dentate granule neurons. This is now called long-term potentiation (LTP).
This discovery was of particular interest because at that time studies such as those 
with H.M. were highlighting the hippocampus in declarative memory. Today LTP 
is typically studied in brain slices in the Schaffer collaterals, from CA3 axons to 
CA1 neurons. Electrical stimulation of CA3 axons induces them to fire action 
potentials, and an electrode records dendritic excitatory post synaptic potentials 
from a population of CA1 dendrites.
LTP induction
CA3 neurons are glutamatergic neurons. Their synaptic targets, CA1 neurons, have 
dendritic spines that contain AMPA and NMDA type glutamate receptors. AMPA 
receptors require only glutamate binding to be activated. NMDA receptors require 
both depolarization (to remove the magnesium block) and glutamate binding to 
be activated.
Following high frequency (tetanic) stimulation, glutamate is released by the CA3 
axons, AMPA receptors are immediately activated, and the influx of sodium pro￾duces depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane called an EPSP. This depolar￾ization and the presence of glutamate activates the NMDA receptor channels, 
mediating sodium and calcium influx, with a further depolarization and increase 
in postsynaptic calcium levels.298 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Early phase of LTP
The increased calcium leads to the activation of protein kinases that phosphorylate 
many substrates. The kinases include CaMK, PKC, PKA, and Erk. In LTP, the impor￾tant substrates are AMPA receptors and proteins involved in the trafficking and teth￾ering of AMPA receptors. The phosphorylation results in an increase in the number 
and activity of AMPA receptors at the post-synaptic membrane, and subsequently, a 
larger synaptic response. The postsynaptic effect can be accompanied by changes in 
the presynaptic CA1 axons that increase the amount of glutamate released.
The opposite of LTP is called long-term depression (LTD). It can be induced by stim￾ulating CA3 axons with a low frequency (1 Hz) stimulation. This too leads to CA1 
AMPA receptor activation, but only a modest depolarization, partial activation of 
NMDA receptors, and modest increase in intracellular calcium. This lower level of 
calcium preferentially activates protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate AMPA 
receptors and their trafficking and tethering proteins. This results is a decrease in 
the number and activity of AMPA receptors at the synapse and LTD.
In early LTP, the calcium and kinase activations occur within the first 30 minutes 
following electrical stimulation, but the effects persist in slices for many hours. In 
addition to increased synaptic AMPA receptors, LTP involves biochemical and 
structural changes to dendrites and synapses that maintain the potentiation. The 
increase in calcium and activation of kinases in early LTP also lead to effects on 
gene expression in late LTP.
Late phase of LTP
Late LTP involves regulation of transcription and translation that produce lasting 
alterations of synaptic proteins and synaptic remodeling. In late LTP, changes in 
transcription factors and dynamic epigenetic modifications regulate gene expres￾sion and the levels of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity. Plasticity proteins 
include additional transcription factors, AMPA receptors, scaffolding proteins, 
and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
Protein synthesis and cytoskeletal changes can lead to increased dendritic spine 
volume and synaptic size. In some neurons, in late LTP, new synapses can also 
form. LTD is accompanied by its own changes in gene expression and decreases in 
dendritic and synaptic size.
Identifying additional mechanisms 
in synaptic plasticity
Synaptic modifications can depend on both presynaptic and postsynaptic 
mechanisms. When synapses are simultaneously activated on a postsynaptic CA1 
neuron, increasing calcium through NMDA channels, the CA1 neuron may CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 299
synthesize and send a retrograde messenger back to the CA3 presynaptic axon. 
This messenger can regulate neurotransmitter release and other activities.
Several retrograde messenger candidates have been identified. They include the 
gaseous transmitters nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and lipid mediators 
including endocannabinoids. The neurotrophic factor BDNF, released from post￾synaptic CA1 neurons, has also been implicated as a retrograde messenger.
Evidence suggests that learning in healthy brains may also be accompanied by 
neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons in the hippocampus. Neurogenesis 
occurs in the dentate gyrus where new granule neurons are produced from pro￾genitors and has been proposed to be involved in hippocampal dependent memory 
processes.
Physiological LTP
In the LTP tetanus experiment, strong electrical stimulation of CA3 axons pro￾vides robust presynaptic glutamate release that produces a very large depolariza￾tion of the postsynaptic spines. Under physiological conditions, these input 
pathways never involve such high frequency stimulations.
Instead, the postsynaptic CA1 dendrites would normally receive many simultane￾ous small synaptic inputs from CA3 neurons, downstream of inputs from the 
entorhinal cortex. In vivo, CA1 dendritic synapses will be potentiated if and only if
their inputs are simultaneously activated by coincident inputs. This is because 
NMDA receptors require coincident membrane depolarization and glutamate 
release by CA3 neurons.
The corollary is also true. When the presynaptic axon is active and, at the same 
time, the postsynaptic neuron is only weakly activated by that or other inputs, 
then the synapse formed by the presynaptic axon is weakened in LTD.
Sleeping for better long-term memory
Systems consolidation involves the process in which memories encoded by the 
hippocampus are moved to neocortical circuits for permanent storage. Systems 
consolidation is a slow dynamic process that may take weeks to months in humans. 
It may involve circuit-wide changes in which all the neurons or all their synapses 
undergo some type of similar biochemical change that coordinates and stabilizes 
their activity as a neural circuit.
Long-term memory formation is a major function of sleep. Sleep provides an ideal 
state for systems consolidation. During sleep, very little neuronal activity is trans￾mitted to the hippocampus or neocortex and stored memories are not accessed for 
working memory. This reduces potential interference from activities that could 
disrupt the processes of memory consolidation.300 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Both slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are important for 
consolidating declarative memory. One hypothesis is that systems consolidation 
occurs during SWS during which the memory is transmitted from the hippocam￾pus to the circuits in the neocortex. Next, reorganization within the neocortical 
circuits occurs during REM sleep.
Memories can be reactivated either during training of a task or during sleep after 
the task. Studies show that replay during sleep may be important for systems con￾solidation. Though the mechanisms haven’t been identified, systems consolida￾tion may involve modification of cortical synapses through LTP-like mechanisms, 
such that the cortex itself can reproduce the neural activity associated with an 
experience.
The hippocampus participates in memory formation because hippocampal 
neurons — whose synapses have been activated and strengthened by simultane￾ous inputs from the entorhinal cortex — project reciprocally back to the same 
areas of the cortex. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the same 
cortical areas that represented the experience initially. The hippocampus is a 
scratchpad for linking a set of neurons that were active during an event to form 
the long-term memory of that event.
Resetting the hippocampus for future use
After a memory has been transmitted to the cortical circuit, the hippocampal syn￾apses that had been potentiated need to be reset. This ensures that the hippocam￾pus can be reused for future memory encoding. LTD may function in resetting the 
potentiated synapses and also prevent saturation of synaptic activity. Resetting 
may occur during sleep when the activity in the dendritic spines and excitatory 
synapses is reduced
Needing the hippocampus for some 
memory retrieval
Multiple trace theory contends that while semantic or context-free memories 
become independent of the hippocampus over time, some episodic and contextu￾ally rich memories may always depend on the hippocampus. The theory asserts 
that some memories are stored jointly in hippocampal and cortical circuits. 
Another possibility is that the retrieval of stored contextually rich episodic mem￾ory could require the hippocampus to bind or synchronize its components.
Forming a cognitive map: Spatial memory
The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are required for encoding spatial memo￾ries. Spatial memory allows you to form a cognitive map, responsible for CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 301
maintaining information needed for planning a course to a location and recalling 
the location of objects and occurrence of events.
Multi-electrode recordings of the hippocampus made while rats were running 
mazes identified hippocampal place cells and entorhinal cortex grid cells. These 
cells respond when a rat is in a particular place in the maze, with different cells 
activated by different places in the maze. Other types of cells include boundary, 
head direction, and speed cells.
When the rats slept after maze training sessions, their hippocampal place and grid 
cells and cortical neurons fired in the same pattern and sequence as when origi￾nally traversing the maze, though the time frame was compressed. Place cells may 
have an important role in episodic memory where they contain information about 
the spatial context in which an event took place.
Focusing on synaptic plasticity 
in implicit memory
The amygdala provides input to the hippocampus for emotional content in epi￾sodic memories. In addition, the amygdala is essential for fear conditioning. In the 
formation of conditioned fear memory, synapses in the amygdala undergo LTP 
that is proposed to play a role in encoding the fear memory.
Like hippocampal dependent declarative memory, the amygdala is important for 
forming long-term memory and the memory probably isn’t stored there. The rep￾resentation of stimuli that activate the amygdala are thought to occur primarily in 
the prefrontal cortex, most likely in the orbitofrontal cortex.
LTP has also been demonstrated in procedural memory. The striatum is the input 
region of the basal ganglia. Striatal projection neurons integrate glutamatergic 
excitatory inputs from the cortex and thalamus with dopamine inputs and can 
undergo both LTP and LTD.  Research has shown correlative and causal links 
between striatal plasticity and procedural learning. This plasticity likely occurs 
with learning to encode new skills and habits.
LTD occurs in the cerebellar cortex at excitatory synapses between parallel fibers 
and Purkinje neurons. This is induced by co-activation of parallel fibers and a 
climbing fiber. The effect is a decreased responsiveness to the glutamate released 
by the parallel fibers. This synaptic plasticity has been considered as a critical cel￾lular mechanism for procedural learning. Research studies have shown that cal￾cium, protein kinases, and a decrease in synaptic AMPA receptors are involved in 
cerebellar LTD.302 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Memory retrieval
Information can be retrieved from long-term memory in four ways: 
» Recall
» Recollection
» Recognition
» Relearning
These differ in the nature of the cue or prompt used to trigger the retrieval. Fol￾lowing retrieval, a previously consolidated memory can become labile or change￾able through reactivation of the memory trace. After a memory has been retrieved 
and reactivated, its content can be reconsolidated through a process that enables 
the updating of the memory through exposure to current stimuli and restabilizing 
of the memory.
Comparing computer versus 
animal memory
The human brain doesn’t work like computers. In computers, memories are stored 
data strings without intrinsic meaning, until the strings are combined with infor￾mation that allows them to be interpreted according to rules stored elsewhere. 
Memory in brains is a change in the neural biochemistry and architecture, such 
that the processing chain from stimulus to response operates differently. The 
neural circuits that originally processed stimuli become active in recreating real￾ity, which includes many stimuli, the state of the brain at that time, and aspects 
of the behavioral output.
Forgetting It: Amnesia and Other 
Memory Loss
Humans can lose a memory by two different processes: forgetting the memory or 
failing to retrieve the memory. Practically, distinguishing between these two pro￾cesses can be difficult.
In forgetting, the memory is lost because the synaptic modifications underlying 
the memory are altered or the neurons that instantiate the memory become inac￾tive or die. A memory may exist, however, but be temporarily irretrievable, as 
many students have noted. Often, you’re able to retrieve the memory because of CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 303
some property of your environment is similar to the initial situation in which the 
memory was created. This emphasizes the re-creational aspects of memory.
These sections focus on the process by which memory is lost in the clinical disor￾der called amnesia and after damage to the brain.
Losing yourself in amnesia
A common soap opera plot involves a character losing their memory and interact￾ing with other characters in a completely new way. This sort of amnesia actually 
does occur, but it’s typically temporary. The cause may be brain ischemia (oxygen 
and nutrient deprivation) from a vascular incident or a blow to the head. This sort 
of memory loss may include complete loss of episodic information from the pres￾ent back to some point in the past, as well as semantic loss over a similar period. 
Semantic and procedural information from early life may remain intact.
Electroconvulsive therapy also produces memory loss. The pattern tends to involve 
a four- to six-month retrograde loss and a month or two of anterograde inability 
to form new memories. In many cases, most of the retrograde lost memories 
return. This gives a clue about the memory consolidation process, which must 
take place over several months.
Damaging the hippocampus or frontal lobe
In the movie Groundhog Day, Phil wakes up every morning with memories intact, 
but doomed to repeat the same scenario. This is the opposite of H.M., who men￾tally relived every day anew without any memory of the people or events since his 
surgery. Damage to the hippocampus and nearby temporal lobe interferes with 
memory formation and can compromise the ability to retain recently learned 
information and recall contextually rich events. Stress, physical or emotional 
trauma, and pathologies can reduce neuroplasticity in the hippocampus and pre￾vent learned adaptation to new information.
Damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex disrupts working memory and, 
therefore, the ability to form episodic memories.
The amygdala produces representation of situations that are likely to have nega￾tive consequences, particularly for social situations. The interaction between the 
amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex (a region within the ventromedial prefron￾tal cortex) allows learning of new contingencies that are predictive of negative 
consequences. Damage to this region can cause people to do risky or inappropriate 
things because they have no fear of negative consequences.304 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
This effect is illustrated in the famous case of Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who 
suffered damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The injury transformed 
Gage from a normal, reliable, and responsible crew foreman to an irresponsible 
gambler who swore constantly.
Examining Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. AD likely devel￾ops from multiple factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Muta￾tions in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin can cause inherited forms 
of AD. Variants in the apolipoprotein E4 gene increase the risk of AD with the 
greatest known impact.
The first symptom of AD is memory loss, particularly episodic and spatial mem￾ory. In the early stages of AD the cholinergic neurons (that use acetylcholine) in 
the basal forebrain, which project to the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, have 
impaired function or undergo degeneration. Cholinergic input is a critical part of 
hippocampal physiology, and the loss of these inputs may compromise the ability 
to encode episodic and spatial memories.
AD involves the accumulation of protein aggregates in the brain. The leading 
candidates for the cause of AD are amyloid beta and tau. Amyloid beta is a frag￾ment of APP that is involved in neuronal development. The misfolded amyloid 
beta proteins form amyloid plaques outside neurons — known as senile plaques. 
Aggregated amyloid beta is toxic to neurons.
In AD, tau accumulates inside neurons forming neurofibrillary tangles. Tau’s nor￾mal function is to stabilize microtubules in the cell cytoskeleton, and tau has been 
shown to associate with mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. Tau is regulated by 
phosphorylation, and in AD tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, altering its 
functions.
Cholinergic neurons are particularly susceptible to the damage in AD.  Several 
medications used to treat AD symptoms act by increasing acetylcholine levels or 
efficacy by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, which is the enzyme that breaks down 
acetylcholine. Another drug used to treat AD is memantine, which is an NMDA 
receptor antagonist.
Recently, the FDA approved biologics that have been developed for the treatment 
of AD. Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies are the first disease-modifying thera￾pies for AD. They may slow cognitive decline by decreasing amyloid beta–induced 
disease progression in AD.
The course of AD proceeds from episodic and spatial to semantic memory loss, 
and then finally to large-scale degeneration of neurons throughout the brain. CHAPTER 15 Learning to Remember 305
Declining health is usually caused by the disruption of body function regulation 
carried out by subcortical brain areas.
Improving Your Learning and Memory
Classical learning theory shows that repetition, particularly when associated with 
reinforcement, causes behaviors to be retained, including the ability to recapitu￾late facts in semantic memory. Less well understood, because we have no animal 
model for semantic memory, is the difference between deep learning and shallow 
learning. Deep learning is the linkage of new information to multiple levels of 
one’s already-existing semantic Here we discuss techniques and behaviors that 
are proposed to enhance memory.
Studying hard versus studying well: 
Schedules
Repetition results in learning, but some ways of conducting repetition while 
studying are more effective than others. Two major practices can improve learn￾ing for a given amount of time:
» Deep content association: Deep content association refers to linking new facts 
to multiple aspects of your knowledge base. For example, the shallow method 
to study the Battle of Hastings would be to memorize facts about locations, 
people, and timing. A deeper way to learn would be to simulate the battle in 
your mind or with a map or computer program. If you considered the 
situations the commanders faced and their resources and decisions, you 
would be much more likely to remember the progress of the battle.
» Spaced practice: Also known as spaced repetition or the spacing effect, it’s a 
learning strategy where practice is broken up into a number of short sessions 
over a longer period of time. Cramming is ineffective for long-term retention. 
Learning is more effective when spread out over time. As with distributed 
learning, part of this may involve context. If you practice learning at multiple 
times, in multiple contexts, learning will be deeper and you’ll be more likely to 
recall what you’ve learned.
Traveling the path to better memory
Individuals have known about specific techniques to help them memorize lists 
since ancient times. The most well-known is called the journey method or method 
of loci. In this method, the person imagines walking a familiar route and 306 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
associating a word on the list to be remembered with specific landmarks on the 
route. A memory palace is an imaginary building where you make a journey in the 
same order through the rooms where you’ve stored mnemonic images.
This is an example of a deep association because the route the person uses is 
familiar, and they can remember the entire route. The technique creates a link 
between each landmark and an item on the list, so that the items to be remem￾bered are embedded in the past, current, and future locations to be encountered 
that already exist in memory.
This technique appears to use regions of the hippocampus that have to do with 
spatial learning. Multi-electrode recordings in rats have shown that much of their 
hippocampal resources are devoted to representation of place in spatial naviga￾tion. The journey method links a list to be learned to an already learned spatial 
representation. The hippocampus probably originally evolved primarily for learn￾ing in spatial navigation, and its role in episodic memory evolved later from that.
Enhancing memory through 
training and exercise
Even though many studies show that for healthy individuals, brain-training can 
improve performance on the trained tasks, little evidence suggests that training 
enhances performance on distantly related tasks or improves cognitive 
performance. However, observational studies show that people who do mentally 
stimulating activities may have a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia. 
Other studies show that brain training using cognitive apps can improve cognitive 
performance and processing speed in older adults.
Evidence suggests that both acute and chronic exercise can improve memory 
function. Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain. Exercise can also 
enhance neuroplasticity. It leads to increases in endogenous cannabinoids and 
opioids that may modulate memory. Studies have shown that muscle activity can 
release myokines such as irisin into the circulation, which may increase levels of 
neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, that can enhance synaptic plasticity.CHAPTER 16 The Frontal Lobes and Executive Motor Control 307

The Frontal Lobes and

nsects and invertebrates perform complex behaviors like flying without a 
neocortex  — and they get along just fine. Their subcortical areas are good 
enough for controlling what they need to do. But for humans, that’s not 
good enough.
In humans, a lot of the brain serves the purpose of allowing us to act, and to 
decide how to act, intelligently — based on previous experiences and current situ￾ations. Without a neocortex, the number of possible behaviors we could perform, 
and contingencies that we base our decisions to act, are very limited.
The frontal lobe controls the complex plans you need to make for doing all kinds 
of things, every day. Hitting tennis balls and climbing a ladder to paint the ceiling 
are behaviors that require a frontal lobe to execute. And the human frontal lobe, 
particularly on the left side, allows you to have not only thoughts, but thoughts 
about thoughts, and thoughts about thoughts about thoughts. This chapter looks 
at how the human brain allows you to act in complex ways depending on your 
goals, experience, and self-awareness.

Comparing Reflexes versus Conscious or 
Goal-Generated Action
Flight is one of the most complex animal behaviors. Wing movements must 
account for obstacles, wind and wind changes, air pressure, current altitude, and 
direction. Yet many primitive animals, such as insects, fly quite well. The intelli￾gence necessary for flight in invertebrates is embedded in their genome, which 
learned or adapted over billions of years of evolution.
Insect flight demonstrates that complex behaviors don’t necessarily require large 
brains. Large brains are required for complex planning, maintaining status and 
surviving in large social groups. But some insects — such as ants — exist in large 
social groups called castes. In ants, castes include queen, worker, drone, and prin￾cess (but no social status within each caste). So membership in large social groups 
also doesn’t require a large brain.
The crucial difference between insect and mammalian social groups is that insect 
social groups are composed of only a few castes. An insect’s behavior is almost 
completely specified by a few types of responses to stimuli as a function of its 
caste. But many mammalian social groups consist of individuals, each of which 
has a specific identity and social rank. Interactions between mammals in a social 
group depend on things like their mutual rank, which other individuals are pres￾ent and their ranks, and on the outcomes of previous encounter-experiences of all 
these individuals. This is particularly true for primates, who maintain separate, 
simultaneous male and female social hierarchies, with the male hierarchies in a 
constant status of flux due to dominance contests.
Large brains are associated with the need for complex representations of reality. 
A mammal can be in the exact same situation today  — as represented by the 
senses — as yesterday; however, the appropriate behavior today could be quite 
different from what it was yesterday, depending on the memory of what was 
observed to happen yesterday between other members of the troop.
The need for this type of situational intelligence drove hominid evolution far 
beyond the brain size needed for a complex behavior such as flight. It required the 
ability to enhance sensory processing to detect subtle facial expressions, posture 
changes, and cues from vocalization. It required episodic memory (refer to 
Chapter 15) for the outcomes of specific encounters and subtle changes in vocal￾izations that conveyed, or sometime hid, information about status.
The neocortex, particularly the frontal lobes, allowed a much more nuanced 
control of behavior than was possible from limbic stimulus-response instinctive 
control. The representation of complex contingencies in the brain allowed CHAPTER 16 The Frontal Lobes and Executive Motor Control 309
complex planning and tool making. Producing experience-dependent vocalization 
led to language, sophisticated cooperation, and teaching the young. The large 
contingency-representing human brain also produced bluffing, lying, deceit, 
altruism, and spiritual explanations for reality. The following sections describe 
how the neocortex built on evolutionary older vertebrate brain structures for the 
control of movement and behavior.
Turning ideas and goals into action
The brain is designed not by engineers, but by evolution via natural selection. The 
nervous system consists of a lot of hacks — repairs, patches, and shortcuts in a 
large system that evolved modifications to deal with an unforeseen contingencies 
with causing the least amount of disruption to the rest of the system.
Hacks work best in modular hierarchical systems because this structure limits the 
effects of the hack inserted to deal with the unforeseen contingency on other sys￾tems. For example, an ancient evolutionary hack is to use the reflex of stepping 
when falling forward to generate walking. Many brain functions are implemented 
by neural circuits no engineer would design but that were adapted for new uses 
from existing circuits.
Lizards and frogs can generate all their locomotive behaviors without a neocortex 
by using the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal pattern generators and reflexes. 
When mammals evolved a neocortex, they didn’t throw this older neural circuitry 
away and develop a new system. Instead, mammals co-opted the less complex 
systems they inherited by controlling them at a higher level, based on more com￾plex contingencies and learning.
For example, monkey A may notice a rival coming into its area. Monkey A doesn’t 
want to confront monkey B because he has an ally who isn’t around now. Monkey 
A doesn’t want to flee or give evidence of submission. Monkey A’s best strategy is 
to use deceit and leave quickly but without showing fear. Monkey A’s frontal lobes 
are generating all these calculations, using the monkey’s subcortical gait control 
systems to carry out the actions of his limbs, moving it away from monkey B. The 
subcortical limbic systems may be prompting monkey A to flee hurriedly from the 
threat, but he doesn’t.
Humans in particular have generated novel behaviors. Examples are odd gaits like 
skipping and gait patterns in dancing, or dexterous hand use for making and 
using tools and sign language. These behaviors have led to the development of a 
nearly complete cortical circuit for control of the limbs that largely bypasses more 
subcortical control used by other mammals.310 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Just anterior to the primary motor cortex are two areas: 
» Supplementary motor area: Located in the medial frontal cortex, anterior to 
the primary motor cortex
» Premotor cortext: Also known as Broadmann area 6, located in the lateral 
frontal cortex anterior to primary motor cortex
Abstract goals represented in the prefrontal cortex activate the basal ganglia and 
either the supplementary motor area and cerebellum or the premotor cortex and 
parietal lobe for generating action sequences. These areas, in turn, activate the 
primary motor cortex to control muscles directly (refer to Chapter  8 for more 
details). These areas allow new and learned capabilities, such as hitting a tennis 
backhand or building a bookcase.
Representing actions at multiple levels
Most goals can be reached in many ways. If you want ice cream, you can drive to 
the grocery store or to an ice cream parlor or walk or cycle to those places; you can 
ask your neighbor if they have any; or you can make it yourself if you have an ice 
cream maker and the ingredients.
The goal of wanting ice cream is very abstract, probably represented in lateral 
prefrontal cortex with inputs from hunger mechanisms, emotion, and memory. 
Evidence suggests that this goal may simultaneously activate many of the possible 
ways of achieving it. The activation of goal resolution paths generates the sub￾goals required for each of them. Your frontal lobe has to sort out the requirements 
for the subgoals as well.
The real hallmark of frontal lobe engagement is what happens when the planned 
procedure doesn’t work. If you planned to cycle to the grocery store but your bike 
has a flat tire, is it now more appropriate to fix the tire or try to get to the store 
another way? Your frontal lobes are constantly doing all these calculations for all 
your goals. Much of this is unconscious, and much of it depends on learning and 
experience that evolution couldn’t have programmed.
Deciding How to Do It: The Frontal Lobes
Play is a nearly universal behavior in young mammals. Play is practice for learning 
behaviors. Predator mammals play at catching and knocking down prey, whereas 
prey animals practice escaping. Mammals also explore, establish, and defend CHAPTER 16 The Frontal Lobes and Executive Motor Control 311
territories. This requires complex spatial memory that includes somatosensory, 
visual, olfactory, and audio sensory processing. The complex associations between 
what’s perceived in the environment, experience, and learned contingency￾specific behaviors depend on processing in the frontal lobes.
The following sections explain how the frontal lobes use planning and past 
experiences to override your more primitive goals and control behavior.
Originating abstract plans
The frontal lobes are connected extensively with the limbic system. One way to 
think about limbic system control of behavior is to think about the limbic system 
as a device for switching states. Most animals have a finite number of goal states, 
such as seeking water, food, a mate, or shelter. The limbic system receives input 
from the body’s homeostatic mechanisms, and, with limited sensory input depen￾dency, selects the highest priority from a set of evolutionarily programmed 
behaviors, such as seeking a water hole or a mate.
Role of frontal lobes
The frontal lobes add the ability to represent reality in the context of past experi￾ence and current situation and goals. Even if an animal is extremely thirsty, let￾ting another member of the herd drink first may be a better idea, in case the 
crocodile it remembers has quietly returned. The frontal lobes are overriding the 
highest-priority state selected by the limbic system based on something that isn’t 
detected now but is remembered for this situation.
Frontal lobes allow abstract decisions and planning not closely linked to current 
body state or observable environmental cues. A thirsty collection of animals may 
drink from a water hole until satisfied and then leave. A frontal lobe competent 
troupe may avoid the water hole at a particular time of day during which they 
remember that lions show up  — allowing the other animals water access at a 
very bad time.
Complexity of contingency planning
This kind of abstract contingency planning doesn’t require consciousness, but it 
does require complex learning, memory, and nuanced representations of reality. 
Vocalizations that refer to internal representations of reality, rather than to what 
is actually there, can be the first underpinnings of language. For example, a mon￾key gives a call that signals the presence of a lion because the monkey remembers 
that lions show up at sunset, not because the monkey is actually looking at a 
lion now.312 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Converting plans to body control
A problem with abstract plans is that one can carry them out in many ways. Com￾plex plans have multiple steps, each of which is contingent on the availability of 
certain resources, on having the prior steps completed, and on the ability to begin 
the next step in the sequence.
At one level, complex processing in the frontal lobes is necessary to execute a 
sequence of subgoals necessary to accomplish an overall goal. A higher level of 
cortical processing can veto the action sequence if any of the subgoals can’t be 
accomplished. So don’t even start going to the water hole if the wind is blowing in 
such a direction that you won’t be able to smell the lions.
Commanding with the prefrontal cortex
The prefrontal cortex, located in the anterior-most half of the frontal lobes, is 
considered the command center for goal-directed behavior. Highly interconnected 
with the rest of the brain, the prefrontal cortex has key roles in executive func￾tions and emotional control. Its basic executive functions include attention, work￾ing memory, and cognitive control – the intentional selection of thoughts, 
emotions, and behaviors based on current task  demands and social context. 
Higher-order executive functions include planning, reasoning, decision-making, 
and problem-solving.
The prefrontal cortex provides coordination and execution of motor actions through 
its involvement in goal setting, decision-making, motivation, and cognitive con￾trol. Four main anatomical regions comprise the prefrontal cortex that are well 
connected with each other, with several overlapping or complementary functions. 
Both dorsal and ventral regions of the prefrontal cortex have been implicated in 
goal-directed motor control, though the exact circuits and outputs remain elusive.
The activation of high-level goals in the prefrontal cortex appears to activate all 
the neural circuit subgoal chains that can satisfy the goal. Athletic coaches know 
that imagining hitting a tennis forehand activates the premotor sequence for 
doing so and can improve a player’s skill, even though the actual output to the 
muscles is suppressed. A similar thing occurs in movement dreams in REM sleep 
where motor sequences are activated all the way to the spinal level, but the final 
output is suppressed so you don’t actually move (except for cases where thrashing 
and sleepwalking occur).
Executing a goal requires that abstract plans be translated into specific motor 
sequences and then to muscle contractions. Neural activity starts with represen￾tations of high-level goals in the prefrontal cortex and moves to activate the sup￾plementary motor area or premotor cortex in the motor cortex, which then drives 
motor neuron outputs in the primary motor cortex.CHAPTER 16 The Frontal Lobes and Executive Motor Control 313
Initiating Action in the Basal Ganglia
The section “Comparing Reflexes versus Conscious or Goal-Directed Behavior” 
earlier in this chapter discusses the frontal lobes overriding the limbic system and 
basal ganglia in control of behavior (refer also to Chapter 8). The basal ganglia 
remain involved in executing the action, however. This fact is dramatically obvi￾ous from observations of patients with Parkinson’s disease, which is associated 
with loss of dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra, a component of the 
basal ganglia.
Patients with Parkinson’s can certainly formulate abstract motor plans, but they 
have trouble initiating and executing them. This suggests that the instantiation of 
the motor sequence conceived in the prefrontal cortex still depends on subcortical 
structures to initiate, implement, and provide feedback control to deal with errors. 
The following sections delve into the ins and outs of the basal ganglia.
Preparing for action
The basal ganglia receive inputs from prefrontal, motor, and sensory association 
areas of the neocortex and the thalamus for voluntary motor control. The function 
of the basal ganglia is to select, among the simultaneously active frontal lobe 
motor programs, the one to execute at a particular time. The overall output of the 
basal ganglia inhibits all the motor sequences except the one selected, via its 
release from inhibition. The basal ganglia operate in a loop through the thalamus 
with the frontal lobes, such that the particular frontal motor sequence that the 
basal ganglia selects is partly controlled by the frontal lobes.
One hypothesis is that the basal ganglia operate in a winner-takes-all selection 
among active frontal lobe motor program sequences. This selection may involve a 
threshold effect by which one program sequence in the frontal lobes that is slightly 
more active than the others is selected and reinforced through the thalamus. This 
selection process is important in procedural learning and learning routine behav￾iors in particular situations.
Patterning and oscillating
Many neural oscillatory rhythms (brainwaves) occur in the brain that are evident in 
electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. Different frequency waves (bands) have 
been given different names, such as 
» Theta (3 to 10 Hz)
» Beta (15 to 30 Hz)
» Gamma (30 to 80 Hz)314 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
These waves are important in the normal functioning of the basal ganglia. In the 
subthalamic nucleus, a significant upregulation in the amplitude of beta waves is 
associated with Parkinson’s disease and is thought to contribute to bradykinesia 
and rigidity. Oscillations in the gamma band that facilitate movement (prokinetic) 
are decreased in Parkinson’s disease. Medications or treatments in patients with 
Parkinson’s disease that increase dopamine reduce the beta oscillations and 
increase oscillations in the gamma band.
Also, between the basal ganglia and the cerebellum is an important neural loop 
(see Chapter 8). This loop regulates the selection and initiation of action via pat￾tern classification operations in the striatum (the input layer of the basal ganglia). 
Medium spiny neurons in the striatum disinhibit one particular thalamo-cortical 
loop activity pattern that increases at the expense of others. The loop with the 
cerebellum then amplifies and refines this pattern as it continues during the 
action sequence.
Learning with the basal ganglia
The striatum is the major input region of the basal ganglia. In addition to its roles 
in action selection and initiation, it also represents a major site of learning and 
memory for goal-directed actions and habit formation. These are types of implicit/
nondeclarative memory called procedural memory (see Chapter 15), which involve 
encoding and storage of cognitive, motor, and perceptual habits and skills. Proce￾dural memory also involves the cerebellum, which we describe in the section 
“Sequencing in the cerebellum and strengthening synaptic pathways” later in this 
chapter.
The dorsal striatum is composed of two subregions: 
» Cortical inputs from associative and prefrontal cortex project to the dorsome￾dial striatum. This region is involved in reward-guided instrumental learning, 
which supports goal-directed behavior.
» Cortical inputs from sensorimotor and premotor cortices project to the 
dorsolateral striatum. This region is involved in learning phases associated 
with habit formation and performance.
The majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic inhibitory neurons, called 
medium spiny neurons. They receive cortical input from somatosensory, prefrontal 
and motor cortices, and thalamic neurons. The great majority of these cortical 
inputs are glutamatergic. The striatum also receives inputs from dopaminergic 
neurons in the substantia nigra and from nearby cholinergic neurons within the 
striatum.CHAPTER 16 The Frontal Lobes and Executive Motor Control 315
Long-term synaptic plasticity at the major inputs, the cortico-striatal synapses, 
has been proposed as a mechanism that enables the basal ganglia circuits to func￾tion in the acquisition and maintenance of motor skills and habits. Both long￾term potentiation and long-term depression have been observed in striatal 
synapses. Both types of synaptic plasticity are proposed to be involved in encoding 
procedural memory. In many features, the striatum is analogous to the hippo￾campus, which binds cortical and subcortical inputs and encodes declarative 
memory using long-term synaptic plasticity.
Coordinating through the Motor Cortex
The supplementary motor area and premotor cortex lie functionally between the 
abstract representation of goals and plans in the prefrontal cortex and the control 
of muscles or muscle groups in the primary motor cortex. The supplementary 
motor area and premotor cortex organize goals into muscle movement sequences. 
But they do this differently. Well-known, internally generated (driven) movement 
involves the supplementary motor area. Sensory-guided (externally cued) 
movement — such as manipulating a novel object — involves the premotor cortex.
The following sections expand on the connections and roles of the premotor cor￾tex and supplementary motor area in controlling voluntary movements.
Feeding back to guide movement
The premotor cortex is involved in more complex movements than mediated by 
the primary motor cortex, which might by itself control simple actions like 
squeezing a ball with the hand. The location of the premotor cortex places it near 
the primary motor cortex areas that control the body’s trunk muscles.
The premotor cortex receives sensory feedback from the parietal lobe (posterior 
parietal cortex — a major sensory association area) through the thalamus. The 
premotor cortex projects not only to primary motor cortex, but also directly to the 
spinal cord, the striatum, and back to the motor thalamus. The premotor cortex is 
important for guiding your movement using sensory feedback. Complex move￾ments, such as climbing, are associated with the premotor cortex. (If, say, you’re 
climbing a ladder, you need to move all four limbs in a coordinated way while 
being aware of the space around your body.) Because of the direct projections from 
premotor cortex to the spinal cord, the hierarchy between the premotor cortex and 
the primary motor cortex isn’t absolute, and the premotor cortex can control 
movement bypassing the primary motor cortex.
Neurons in the premotor cortex are active when you’re learning motor sequences. 
Neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex become active in response to a stimulus cue 316 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
to act and may remain active during any delay before the action occurs. Some evi￾dence exists that entire action sequences are represented in the premotor cortex 
as behavioral repertoires, such that different parts of the movement repertoire are 
represented in different premotor cortex subregions. The subregions compute 
spatial trajectory and control the movements of joints and muscles.
Using the supplementary motor area
The supplementary motor area is medial and anterior to the primary motor cortex 
leg representation. The supplementary motor area controls movements and 
movement sequences that are generated internally, rather than triggered by sen￾sory events. It may also be involved in stabilizing the body, particularly in coordi￾nating both sides of the body together. Like the premotor cortex, neurons in the 
supplementary motor area also project directly to the spinal cord and may directly 
control movement.
The supplementary motor area receives strong inputs from most prefrontal cortex 
but much less input from the posterior parietal cortex. This area is strongly con￾nected to the thalamus and the basal ganglia. It’s important for complex locomo￾tion such as climbing, leaping, and other complex behavioral repertoires, 
particularly those that have been learned and internalized.
The supplementary eye field (SEF) is located anteriorly in the supplementary 
motor area. This area and the frontal eye field (FEF) anterior to that in the frontal 
cortex are involved in generating saccadic eye movements. Some evidence sug￾gests that FEF represents saccades with respect to the target location on the ret￾ina, whereas saccades may be represented in the SEF with respect to their location 
relative to the head. The pattern of connections between these two areas suggests 
a mapping between them that converts the head-oriented saccade representation 
in SEF to a retina-oriented saccade representation in FEF.
Learning motor sequences
Motor sequence learning is the process by which a sequence of motor actions is 
produced with improved accuracy and precision. Early behaviorists believed that 
motor sequence learning comprised a reflex chain in which the completion of each 
movement in the chain triggered the next. However, this can’t be the whole story 
because movements can occur even without sensory feedback, and some move￾ment sequences occur too quickly to depend on sensory feedback.
Learned motor sequences are efficiently represented in hierarchical plan organi￾zations that combine lower-level sequences into larger units, called chunking. 
Motor sequence learning can occur with or without conscious awareness of the 
learning process.CHAPTER 16 The Frontal Lobes and Executive Motor Control 317
Practicing mentally
Motor sequence learning can be explicit or implicit:
» Explicit sequence learning means being aware (conscious) that you’re practicing 
a skill, like hitting a tennis ball.
» Implicit learning means that, during practice, you get better at something 
without being aware (not conscious) of exactly how that’s occurring.
In a typical sequence when you’re acquiring a skill, you’re more attentive in the 
initial phase (explicit learning), but after repeated practice, the skill becomes 
almost automatic as you improve (implicit learning).
Even if it’s raining outside, you can still practice your tennis serve  — in your 
mind! Practice can be effective even if the activity is only imagined. This imagined 
activity is called motor imagery, and it has been shown to be effective in sports 
training and to rehabilitate motor deficits associated with some disorders such as 
multiple sclerosis and motor deficits from strokes.
Motor imagery activates early and late stages of motor control, including the sup￾plementary motor area, primary motor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, basal 
ganglia, and cerebellum. Activation of the primary motor cortex during motor 
imagery is, however, at a less intense level than during actual action execution. 
This is sufficient to increase muscular activity and is specific to the muscles asso￾ciated with the imagined action.
Sequencing in the cerebellum and 
synaptic pathways
When a neural code or representation for a learned skill is created in the brain, it’s 
called a procedural memory. Refer to the section “Learning with the basal gan￾glia” in this chapter for more about the basal ganglia. The cerebellum also plays 
an essential role in motor and procedural learning, particularly where fine adjust￾ments have to be made to the action sequence.
The cerebellum has several major cell types in a stereotypical, repeated circuit 
(see Figure 16-1). Purkinje cells in outer layers of the cerebellum inhibit deep cer￾ebellar nuclei. The thin dendritic arbors of aligned Purkinje cells form stacks 
through which parallel fibers from the deeper layers pass. The parallel fibers (the 
axons of the granule cells) make excitatory (glutamatergic) but weak synapses 
onto Purkinje cell dendritic spines. Climbing fibers, which originate from the 
inferior olivary nucleus in the medulla, have a more potent excitatory input to the 
Purkinje cell that is nearer to dendrites and cell soma.318 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Motor learning in the cerebellum is mediated primarily by LTD of parallel fiber 
synapses onto Purkinje cells. Climbing fibers provide the teaching signal that 
induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses. Climbing 
fiber activity represents an error signal.
Purkinje cells have two different types of action potentials:
» Simple spikes: They occur spontaneously and when Purkinje cells are 
activated by the parallel fibers.
» Complex spikes: They exhibit an initial large-amplitude potential followed by 
a burst of smaller-amplitude spikes induced by climbing fiber activation.
Complex spikes can generate calcium-mediated action potentials in the 
Purkinje cell dendrites. This can shift Purkinje cell activity from a quiet state to 
a spontaneously active state. The complex spike, generated by the climbing 
fiber, serves as an error signal during learning — complex spike activity 
increases when a mismatch occurs between an intended movement and the 
movement actually executed.
Basket and stellate cells in the cerebellar molecular layer (refer to Figure 16-1) 
make GABAergic inhibitory inputs to the Purkinje cell. Stellate cells synapse onto 
Purkinje cell dendrites, but basket cells contact the Purkinje cell axon initial seg￾ment. Basket cells mediate feedforward inhibition (see Chapter 8) onto Purkinje 
cells as part of the process of sequence tuning.

Whereas feedback inhibition, such as in spinal cord reflexes, tends to maintain a 
limb in a particular position, feedforward inhibition is used to program actions 
such as slowing down a limb before it reaches the target, so that if you reach to 
grab an apple hanging from a tree limb, your hand doesn’t go past the apple, but 
stops in the right place. This occurs prior to any sensory feedback coming from 
contact with the apple.
Activation of presynaptic NMDA receptors in stellate cells increases their GABA 
release and changes the composition of their glutamate receptor subunits. These 
long-lasting changes are one of the associative learning cellular mechanisms in 
the cerebellum.
Mirroring Others: Mirror Neurons
In primates, mirror neurons have been recorded in the premotor cortex, the sup￾plementary motor area, the primary somatosensory cortex, and the inferior pari￾etal cortex. These neurons fire when an animal performs a specific act and, 
interestingly, when the animal observes the same action performed by another 
animal or a human. The neurons are named mirror neurons because their activity 
reflects the behavior of another animal doing what would activate the neuron in 
the observer animal.
Mirror neurons were discovered by the Italian researcher Dr. Giocomo Rizzolatti 
and colleagues in the 1980s while recording from neurons in the ventral premotor 
cortex of the macaque monkey that were involved in the control of hand and 
mouth actions during eating. Some of the neurons responded when the monkey 
saw a person pick up food, as well as when the monkey picked it up itself.
In humans, neuronal activity consistent with that of mirror neurons has been 
observed in the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and inferior parietal cortex. 
The following discusses potential functions of mirror neurons.
Defining mirroring behaviors
Mirror neurons appear to help us do many things:
» Learn new skills by imitating others. If mirror neurons simulate observed 
actions, their activity may be like a kind of mental practice for an 
action sequence.
» Understand the actions and intentions of others. In social situations, 
mirror neurons have also been suggested to help an animal understand 320 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
others. This is consistent with suggestions that autism may involve some 
problem with the mirror neuron system. It has also been suggested that the 
human Broca’s region is homologous to the area of the monkey ventral 
premotor cortex where mirror neurons have been recorded. A significant 
number of neurons in the macaque monkey inferior parietal cortex also have 
mirror properties, responding to direct hand gestures and observed ones.
» Empathize. Some evidence exists for the involvement of mirror neurons in 
empathy. The anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and inferior frontal 
cortex are active when people experience emotions such as disgust, pain, and 
happiness, as well as when subjects see another person experiencing these 
emotions. People who score higher on self-report questionnaires for empathy 
show stronger activation of mirror neurons for emotions and hand gestures.
A more controversial idea is that mirror neurons may provide the neurological 
basis of self-awareness in humans by representing actions at an abstract level.
Imitating others through mirroring
If mirror neurons mediate automatic imitation and motor mimicry, then the 
mirror neuron system may contribute to cognitive functions such as social aware￾ness and other social behavior according to having what’s called a theory of mind. 
Automatic imitation is where a person observing a body movement deliberately 
performs a similar one. This can mediate empathizing with the person we’re 
observing and understanding his or her intentions.
Some researchers argue that human language evolved from a mirror neuron sys￾tem for understanding gestures. Human brain areas homologous to those where 
mirror neurons have been found in monkeys are located in the inferior frontal 
cortex, close to Broca’s area, a main language region of the brain. When people 
gesture to each other, as in the game of charades, fMRI activity increases in brain 
areas of human observers, consistent with being driven by mirror neurons.CHAPTER 17 Thinking About Intelligence, Language, and Lateralization 321

Thinking About 
Intelligence, Language, 
and Lateralization
Language, consciousness, and thought are uniquely human traits. (However, 
if your dog can ask for their dinner in full sentences, please post the video 
online and send us the link.) Cognitive functions and consciousness are 
impressive abilities. How a brain only about twice the size of a chimpanzee’s but 
smaller than a dolphin’s or elephant’s developed these abilities is unclear, 
although many theories exist. This chapter looks at the basis of language. We also 
discuss the notion of intelligence and consider that mysterious but important fea￾ture that’s quite special to humanity — consciousness.
Cognitive functions refer to mental abilities and processes involved in the acquisi￾tion of knowledge, manipulation of information, and reasoning.  They include 
attention, perception, executive functions (see Chapter 16), learning and memory 
(check out Chapter 15), and language abilities (which we discuss here). Cognitive

functions involve multiple interconnected cortical brain regions, are interdepen￾dent, and are the basis of intelligence, the ability to acquire and apply knowledge 
and skills. Many scientists also predict that consciousness emerges from complex 
interactions among cognitive functions.
Adapting the Human Brain for Language
Language requires a brain that can perform complex sensory processing, execute 
complex behavior, and communicate by utterances and postures (body language). 
Somewhere along the lines of evolution, the human brain adapted complex lan￾guage capabilities. Here we look at the major organizational features of the brain 
that adapted for thought, language, and consciousness.
Finding how the brain is organized
If you look at the brain as a collection of 86 billion neurons, each with a thousand 
synapses, the possibility of truly understanding the brain seems hopeless. How￾ever, knowing four principles of brain organization is a good start to understand￾ing how the brain works:
» Neuron types are countable. Usually less than 100 different types of 
neurons are found in any particular region of the central nervous system.
» Neuronal circuits tend to have similar structures even in different areas 
of the brain. Once the neocortex evolved in mammals, its layered structure 
has remained the same in all mammals, including humans. Primate and 
human brains increased in size through addition of new areas of neocortex. 
All neocortex is thought to contain essentially the same neural circuitry, 
repeated in millions of minicolumns.
A minicolumn is a vertical column in neocortex containing about 100 to 200 
neurons. Neurons in a minicolumn receive common inputs, have common 
outputs, and are interconnected. Many neuroscientists consider minicolumns 
to be the fundamental computational unit of the neocortex.
» The brain works using a small world of connections. Local connections are 
much denser than those over long distances. Having most processing happen 
over short distances means the brain is modular and compact. Results of 
connections are shipped over a relatively small numbers of output axons to 
other cortical, brain or spinal cord regions.CHAPTER 17 Thinking About Intelligence, Language, and Lateralization 323
» The brain is hierarchical. Hierarchical cortical organization has been shown 
in sensory, memory and reward systems. Adjacent cortical areas in the 
hierarchy are connected by strong forward connections, with weaker, but 
important feedback projections. High-level controllers can also control 
low-level controllers, like a home’s thermostat that operates the furnace and 
air conditioner to maintain the temperature.
To understand the brain, you need to understand how a finite number of basic 
types of neurons work, how these neurons operate in a finite number of neural 
circuits, what the different processing modules are (a finite number), and how the 
overall control scheme is laid out. Of course, this sounds simpler than it actually 
is, but these principles are much easier to understand than trying to tackle 86 bil￾lion neurons, each with a thousand of synapses.
Contemplating with the neocortex
Many scientists believe (or assume) that whatever differentiates human brains 
(which have consciousness) from nonconscious brains resides in the neocortex. 
This assumption is based on the fact that neocortical expansion differentiates 
mammals from nonmammals, primates from other mammals, and humans from 
primates. It’s also based on the fact that in the case of language — which enables 
consciousness — damage to specific brain areas (Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas) 
causes specific language problems.
Assuming that neocortical expansion alone is responsible for consciousness may 
not be entirely correct. The cerebellum, for example, expanded considerably in 
primates and humans compared to other mammals. But even if unique human 
abilities originated in some changes in the neocortex, they cascaded into changes 
in subcortical structures as well.
The neocortex is the place to start looking for the basis of higher cognitive func￾tions. Taking a top-down view of the brain starts with the four major lobes of the 
neocortex: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. The frontal lobe organizes 
motor output and produces executive functions, while the other three lobes pro￾cess sensory information and interact with the frontal lobe to store long-term 
memory. The parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes project to subcortical struc￾tures and to the frontal lobes as part of behavior generation.
One of the most baffling facts about the neocortex is that its structure is very sim￾ilar in all parts of the brain in all mammals. Some differences, such as neuronal 
densities do exist, but the fundamental minicolumn circuitry is mostly the same. 
Therefore, something about this basic processing architecture very well may ena￾ble consciousness.324 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Processing in gray matter
The neocortex has six layers and is made up of gray and white matter (refer to 
Chapter 11). The 3- to 5-millimeter layer of gray matter is where the cell bodies 
and dendrites of the neurons do most of the processing. White matter beneath is 
composed of axons that mediate cortical-to-cortical and cortical–to-subcortical 
connections (in both directions).
Transmitting in white matter
Neocortex expanded in two major ways during mammalian and primate 
evolution:
» Increase in area: The increase of the neocortical area occurred through the 
addition of minicolumns rather than adding single neurons. Increasing the 
number of canonical cortical minicolumn circuit areas eventually caused the 
cortex to become convoluted, with gyri and sulci, to fit inside the skull — like 
wadding up a piece of paper to cram it in a coffee cup.
» Increase in white matter: The brain needed more interconnections as the 
number of neurons increased. Interconnections ultimately limit brain size. 
Each cortical neuron has a few thousand output synapses in a brain of 86 
billion other neurons.
The physical limits of connectivity for 86 billion neurons results in the small 
world principle of neocortical connectivity. The neocortex is composed of gluta￾matergic excitatory neurons and GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Most connections 
in a minicolumn are local and involve excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are 
only connected in one minicolumn. A small percentage of excitatory pyramidal 
neurons constitutes the output of the minicolumn, and even then most of their 
connections are within a few hundred micrometers. Only a small percentage of 
neocortical pyramidal neurons project centimeters or more. This occurs in a fairly 
limited number of major axon tracts, the identification of which is a goal of con￾nectome projects run by the National Institutes of Health and the Allen Institute.
Sensory processing in parietal, temporal, 
and occipital lobes
The five senses are processed in the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. How￾ever, research shows that these areas aren’t purely sensory.
Throughout this book we often refer to these lobes as “sensory,” but that’s an 
oversimplification. (When it comes to the brain, nothing is ever simple.) Process￾ing and integration of sensory information is necessary for determining which 
motor behaviors to execute or which actions to take.CHAPTER 17 Thinking About Intelligence, Language, and Lateralization 325
For example, blind people, who have no retinal output to drive the occipital lobe, 
activate this lobe when identifying objects by touch, which requires internally 
representing the object’s shape and layout. Research has shown that the firing of 
neurons in V1 (visual area 1 — refer to Chapter 13) depends on what an animal, 
such as a monkey, does depending on the visual information. That is, V1 responses 
are dependent on different actions being executed.
One remarkable aspect of sensory cortical connectivity is that areas that project 
“upstream” in the processing hierarchy, such as V1 to V2, typically receive an 
almost equal reciprocal connection. Primary sensory areas (such as V1, S1, and A1) 
that receive inputs from the thalamus also project back to the thalamus. Reticular 
and higher-order thalamic areas can modulate activity in all primary projection 
pathways.
Through the feedback connections, high-level sensory areas can drive lower-level 
sensory areas. High-level sensory areas can themselves be driven by the frontal 
lobe, a motor control lobe. So, motor behavior possibilities can modulate sensory 
processing. This improves what you need to see and hear to carry out the task 
you’re doing.
Specializing for memory
A common misconception is that memory in the human brain works like the 
memory of a computer. In computers, memory is a data string stored in a specific 
location. It has an address so the data can be stored and retrieved when needed. 
But in the human brain, memory involves modification of the synapses of neurons 
that were active when the memory was created. This allows humans to, in a way, 
re-create and reestablish the original brain circuit activity associated with the 
memory. (We discuss memory in Chapter 15.)
Many animals, including invertebrates, have long-term memories that last for 
days, months, or years. Mammals use the hippocampus to encode declarative, 
explicit memories from short-term to long-term memory.
For declarative, explicit memory, sensory areas provide input to the entorhinal 
cortex, which then transmits that information to the hippocampus. Neurons in 
the hippocampus project back to the neocortical areas that activated them. Inter￾play between hippocampal and neocortical activity reproduces important aspects 
of the information to be remembered in the neocortex that initially represented 
that information. Synapses in the neocortex are modified so that the cortex can 
re-create the to-be-remembered state, even if the hippocampus is removed. 
Studies and empirical observations indicate that declarative memory is also asso￾ciated with consciousness. Both the formation and retrieval of semantic and 
episodic memories are linked with phenomenal awareness.326 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
The sensory areas of the neocortex, then, process sensory information not only 
contingent on its motor use, but also based on prior experience, such as, memo￾ries. This whole process is very different from the way standard computers work.
Following Thought through Sensory 
Pathways and Hierarchies
To better understand the neocortex, you need to look at its relation to and depend￾ence on the thalamus. Virtually all sensory input — except for a major olfactory 
pathway — relays through the thalamus to reach the cortex. Thalamic relays also 
control motor programs in the frontal lobes.
Sensory and motor cortical areas also project back to the thalamus. The thalamus 
integrates activities from various cortical areas. Considerable evidence indicates 
that awareness in humans and animals depends on the circuit by which the pre￾frontal sensory neocortices interact through the thalamus. To understand this 
circuit, consider how the thalamus controls neocortical function, which we explore 
in the following sections.
Relaying to the thalamus and cortex
Although human memory and computer memory work quite differently, you can 
use another computer metaphor to understand the interaction between the thal￾amus and neocortex. This is called the subroutine.
In a well-organized computer program, a main program sequences the major 
steps in the computation. This main program calls subroutines or functions for 
more detailed calculations, and the results are returned to the main routine 
sequence. Of course, the subroutines themselves may call other, even lower-level, 
routines.
Taking the visual system as an example, about 1 million retinal ganglion cell axons 
project to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus on each side of the brain. 
About the same number of thalamic relay neurons project to V1, where they 
directly drive 100 to 200 times that many neurons in V1 alone. V1 projects to higher 
visual areas like V2, but also back to thalamus, as do the higher areas. The projec￾tion and return from the thalamus to the neocortex works like a computer pro￾gram’s subroutine call with the thalamus running the main program and the 
neocortex computing details.CHAPTER 17 Thinking About Intelligence, Language, and Lateralization 327
Projecting back to the thalamus
Thalamic neurons are often called relay cells because their receptive fields are sim￾ilar to those of the inputs they receive from sensory areas. But neocortical sensory 
areas contain neurons with more complex and specific response properties than 
primary thalamic recipient areas like V1. This plan continues in higher-order sen￾sory processing areas.
The reciprocal projection from cortex back to thalamus modulates the thalamic 
output. For example, say a linear feature in a visual image is weak because of blur 
or some other object obstructing the feature. Line or edge detectors in the cortex 
may activate and enhance the firing of the thalamic cells along that line to increase 
its neural contrast.
One way that neural contrast is increased in the thalamic output appears to be by 
correlated firing. The tendency for neurons to fire at the same time for some visual 
input to which they are responding.
Figure 17-1 shows how correlated firing works. On the left are the responses of a 
retinal ganglion cell to repetitions of a flash of a small spot. This is called a raster 
plot. Each vertical hash mark represents an action potential that occurred during 
the one-second recording time after the spot was turned on.
Like virtually all sensory neurons in all brains, the responses elicited by repeti￾tions of an identical stimulus are similar but not identical for each repetition. At 
the bottom of the raster plots is the peri- (or post-) stimulus time histogram 
(PSTH). It’s the sum or average of all spikes for all stimuli in a sequence of time 
bins (typically 20 milliseconds).
The idea that the spike pattern doesn’t convey information because the responses 
appear to vary randomly has been overturned in the last decades. The right of 
Figure 17-1 illustrates a hypothetical set of rasters and PSTHs. In the left column 
(Stimulus 1), two cells, A and B, show typical response variability. Their PSTHs are 
shown at the bottom. The asterisks in the second and third stimuli rasters show 
occasions where spikes in the two cells happened to occur at the same time.
In the right column (Stimulus 2), the spikes have been arranged slightly among 
the stimuli so that the PSTHs remain unchanged. However, now the number of 
correlated responses, denoted by the asterisks, is much higher. Recording from 
one cell at a time wouldn’t reveal the differences between the firing correlation 
differences between stimulus sequence 1 and 2. But in stimulus sequence 2 there’s 
much higher correlated firing.328 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
The importance of correlated firing is that cells A and B would be much more 
likely to result in spike production by the postsynaptic target when the spikes 
occurred at nearly exactly the same time, as in sequence 2, versus not so, as in 
sequence 1.
Correlated firing can elevate a small percentage of activity in the brain above the 
background of all the rest of the neural activity. Numerous mechanisms exist by 
which the spike the spike timing of neurons can be adjusted to select some activity 
to aid in brain development or general brain awareness.
An important function of feedback between cortical areas and between cortical 
and subcortical structures (such as the thalamus) is to increase correlated firing 
for sensory input that is important or that needs to be attended to. Correlated 
firing is a major mechanism of attention. It can integrate and select neural activity 
across the entire brain. Considerable evidence exists that correlated firing under￾lies all brain activity you’re conscious of.
Gating and integrating functions
The other major modulator of thalamic activity is through reticular zones within 
the thalamus that are connected to the reticular formation in the brainstem (refer 
to Chapter  10). They modulate signals going through the thalamus and may 
change activity in one area of the thalamus within one sense (for example, 
FIGURE 17-1:
Correlated firing. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.CHAPTER 17 Thinking About Intelligence, Language, and Lateralization 329
enhancing the neural activity coding for red things if you’re looking for some￾thing red) or between senses (enhancing vision at the expense of audition).
The thalamus doesn’t drastically change the character of the sensory and motor 
information relayed through it. But it does modulate that activity through corre￾lated firing and other mechanisms to enhance some information at the expense of 
the rest. In other words, it mediates attention.
This attention mechanism depends on processing in the cortex itself, which 
includes long-term memory changes in the cortex that are induced by experience 
and frontal lobe representations of current goals and contingencies.
Speaking Your Mind: Language, Vision, 
and the Brain Hemispheres
Language sets humans apart from all other animals, and it’s more than commu￾nication. Language is a symbolic system that uses rule-based grammar to enable 
almost infinite expressivity not only for communication, but also for thought and 
memory itself. Consider that, after you walked through a room, someone could 
ask you what was in it. You might reply you saw two lamps, a table, some chairs. 
When asked to describe these items in more detail, like their colors, design 
scheme, and so forth, you might not be able to provide much more information. 
Your brain efficiently stored the verbal labels of the items, not all the details of 
their composition.
Specialized brain regions  — on the left side in most people  — mediate the 
understanding and production of language. Damage to these areas can result in 
language-specific dysfunctions. The right hemisphere of the brain also has spe￾cial capabilities for certain types of holistic processing, notably visual representa￾tions of images. Different processing styles of the left and right hemispheres of 
the brain lead to unique human capabilities.
The following sections describe the characteristics and areas of the brain involved 
in language.
Comparing communication and language
One of the most persistent sources of debate in neuroscience and related fields — 
such as psychology, anthropology, sociology, and even philosophy — is the rela￾tion between animal communication, human language, and consciousness. Why is 
language so special?330 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Animals communicate. Insects communicate via pheromones, and birds and 
monkeys carry on extensive and elaborate verbal communication. Some dogs have 
been shown to recognize more than 100 words. And some chimpanzees have 
coined novel multi-word utterances such as “water bird” for duck.
The difference between language and other types of communication is grammar. 
Think of the difference between arithmetic and algebra. Arithmetic allows you to 
count things and put them in order. Algebra allows you to represent abstract rela￾tionships and to manipulate those abstract relationships using equations.
Communication systems based on hundreds of verbalizations have only as much 
power as the number of words. A grammatical language, however, can represent 
relationships between what the words stand for and relationships between rela￾tionships, such as the relationship between the self and another relationship. As 
caveman Og might say, “We avoid path with hungry tiger.”
Internal vocalizing enables consciousness. Thoughts consist of symbolic repre￾sentations of reality through words and grammar. Thoughts form specific memo￾ries that can be retrieved and related to one’s current situation. This doesn’t mean 
that nonverbal thought doesn’t exist, but only that its power to guide behavior is 
very limited unless the thought is embedded in the complex verbally based repre￾sentation of the world.
Locating language in the brain
The primary language areas (Wernicke’s area and Broca’s area) are located in the 
left hemisphere in 95 percent of all right-handed people and the majority of left￾handed people. The language hemisphere is also usually the dominant hemisphere 
for eye dominance.
Figure 17-2 shows the left hemisphere of a human brain from the side. Wernicke’s 
area is at the junction of the temporal and parietal lobes at the posterior section of 
the superior temporal gyrus, typically associated with Brodmann area 22. This is 
a high-order auditory processing area necessary for understanding language and 
producing language that is coherent.
Broca’s area (typically associated with Brodmann area 44) contains the neural 
machinery for producing language. This frontal lobe area is part of the premotor 
cortex area, which is next to areas of primary motor cortex that control the tongue, 
lips, and vocal cords — all necessary for producing language.CHAPTER 17 Thinking About Intelligence, Language, and Lateralization 331
Losing language from neural dysfunction
Damage to Wernicke’s area causes a specific language loss called Wernicke’s apha￾sia. An aphasia is a loss of ability to either understand or produce speech, or both, 
due to some brain damage. Wernicke’s aphasia is associated with impaired lan￾guage comprehension. People with damage to this area have great difficulty 
understanding speech. They can produce speech that has a normal-sounding 
rhythm, but the speech itself is almost meaningless (also called fluent aphasia). 
They also have difficulty identifying complex nonverbal sounds like jangling keys, 
machine noises, and animal vocalizations.
Damage to Broca’s area reduces speech production, depending on the extent of the 
damage. Extensive damage to Brodmann areas 44 and 45 may almost totally elim￾inate speech, such as Broca’s famous patient who could only utter one word, 
“tan.” Less extensive damage results in people being able to utter only short sen￾tences with simple words. Broca’s patients also have difficulty understanding 
longer, multisyllabic words, and sentences in passive voice, such as “The apple 
was eaten by the boy.”
FIGURE 17-2:
Language areas 
of the brain.

Examining visual processing asymmetries
The right hemisphere of the brain has specializations for visual processing, and 
these are well documented. The ability to recognize faces, for example, is highly 
dependent on the right fusiform face area in the right medial temporal lobe. This 
is a high-order visual processing area in the ventral pathway (refer to 
Chapter 13).
Damage to the right parietal lobe results in hemi-spatial neglect, in which patients 
ignore objects in the left visual field. Men with such damage may not shave the 
left sides of their faces, for example, or they may hit the left side of the garage 
when driving a car into the garage.
The left hemisphere represents knowledge based on rules, and the right hemi￾sphere represents knowledge based on examples. The left hemisphere represen￾tation of a room would consist of relationships that can be put in words, such as 
“The lamp is in the right-rear corner, and the table is in the front middle.” The 
right hemisphere representation would be more like a literal image, not some￾thing you could easily verbalize. Expressing this inner image in language requires 
sending the right-brain image to the left, language-capable hemisphere.
Considering where consciousness lives
Helen Keller had a brain infection that caused her to lose her vision and hearing 
when she was just 19 months old. She gained the ability to communicate with sign 
language at around age 7. By her own accounts, Keller was largely unconscious 
before she was able to communicate.
Many people suffering from epilepsy have had their corpus callosum sectioned to 
prevent seizures from spreading from one hemisphere to the other. In these peo￾ple, when stimuli are presented to the right visual field (left brain hemisphere), 
they can verbally identify and discuss the stimuli quite normally. However, they 
have little ability to verbally identify or understand objects when stimuli are pre￾sented to the left visual field (right brain hemisphere).
The reason for these differences in consciousness is clearly linked to language, but 
not to any known specific neural circuit in the left hemisphere that does not exist 
on the right. Thirty percent of left-handers and a small percentage of right￾handers have language in the right hemisphere. Severe damage to the left 
hemisphere or even its removal in infants can result in normal language located 
in the right hemisphere as well.CHAPTER 17 Thinking About Intelligence, Language, and Lateralization 333
Consciousness sits on top of a great deal of nonconscious brain processing. Aware￾ness, like animals can have, can exist without consciousness. But unique human 
consciousness goes beyond awareness. It’s a symbolic representation system. 
Consciousness allows humans to express and manipulate complex thoughts, both 
externally (through verbal language) and internally (by thinking). Consciousness 
is a process, not a place.
Defining Intelligence
Most people generally think of consciousness (as we discuss in the preceding sec￾tion) as being unique to humans. But intelligence — like awareness — is some￾thing that’s attributed to animals. People say their dogs are intelligent, and robots 
are said to be intelligent machines. (Heck, we even have smartphones!) One way 
to figure out intelligence is to look at examples of what’s considered intelligent, 
which is typically intelligent behavior.
Intelligence is nearly always identified with adaptive behavior. That means perceiv￾ing or inferring information, retaining it, and optimizing what one does in a com￾plex, changing environment. Reflexive behavior, however complex, is built into the 
genetically determined nervous system. This behavior generally happens without 
your thinking about it and isn’t thought of as intelligent — although you could 
make a case that evolutionarily adapted behavior, such as refusing to eat some￾thing that tastes good but has produced illness in the past, is intelligent. A similar 
comparison could be between machines that are programmed to do things, versus 
those that learn to do things.
The following sections provide more details about different types of intelligence.
Math, language, and social intelligence
How else can intelligence be defined? Intelligence is the capacity for understand￾ing, logic and reasoning, learning, self-awareness, critical thinking, problem￾solving, and creativity. Many theories of intelligence have been developed over the 
last century. Many psychologists agree that there are different types of intelli￾gence. The broad range of definitions can pose problems in determining which 
aspects of intelligence are being assessed by any given method. The tendency for 
an individual’s intelligence score in different domains to be correlated across a 
variety of tests is represented by Spearman’s g factor (IQ) and its derivatives.334 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Consider the following about the different types of intelligence:
» Logical/mathematic intelligence: This kind of intelligence refers to the 
ability to reason, think logically, perform mathematical calculations, and 
recognize connections.
» Language intelligence: This kind including vocabulary and the ability to 
understand written passages is a left-brain skill. Even though executing 
rules-based tasks and mathematical procedures may also be a left-brain skill, 
translating real-world situations into mathematical form requires visualization 
and other right-brain abilities. Virtually all assessments of intelligence 
recognize these kinds of differences.
» Social intelligence: Also referred to as interpersonal intelligence, this kind has 
received a lot of attention recently. Social intelligence is the adaptive ability to 
understand the intentions of others and alter your own behavior to acknowl￾edge and use social situations to your advantage. Social intelligence may have 
a neurobiological basis in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala system. 
Social intelligence can be low in people who otherwise have high verbal and 
math intelligence, such as in some kinds of autism. Social, but not IQ test, 
intelligence may also be lost with orbitofrontal damage.
» Other types of intelligence, such as musical and athletic, have been assessed 
in schemes such as Gardner’s multi-intelligence list of eight basic components.
People with savant syndrome have exceptionally high aptitude in one domain, 
such as mathematics or music but significant impairments in other areas of social 
or intellectual functioning. Most individuals with savant syndrome have a devel￾opmental disability such as autism spectrum disorder or have experienced a brain 
injury.
Intelligence components for decisions, 
abstract thinking, problem solving
Many people who study intelligence consider what’s called meta-cognition or 
meta-intelligence to be its highest form. Meta-cognition is an executive function 
that refers to self-reflective capabilities, knowing one’s own strengths and weak￾nesses, and being able to predict one’s reactions to situations.
Meta-cognition is composed of meta-components used in problem solving and 
decision-making. These meta-components use what are called performance 
components to carry out cognition. Performance components are like IQ domains, 
basic skills and processes for adaptive modification of behavior, including percep￾tion, long-term memory, language, and spatial abilities.CHAPTER 17 Thinking About Intelligence, Language, and Lateralization 335
For example, Gardner’s bodily kinesthetic intelligence domain entails the ability 
to control body motions skillfully. Clearly many animals have the ability to do 
this — in many cases, far better than humans. However, animals don’t have the 
meta-cognitive ability to reflect on and reason about body movements or invent 
entirely new body moves by reasoning. Only humans do.
Meta-cognition capabilities are associated with the human prefrontal cortex. This 
area of the brain develops relatively late, with axons not being fully myelinated 
until the late teenage years. Much of what IQ researchers mean by meta-cognition 
is embodied in the common idea of wisdom.
Investigating intelligence factors
Two factors that may indicate intelligence are the size of the brain and the speed 
at which the brain can process information.
Brain size
The brain takes a lot of energy for the body to maintain. In humans the brain con￾sumes about 20 percent of our total metabolism, but it accounts for only about 
2 percent of our body weight. Brains, like other organs, scale up with body weight. 
The brains of whales can reach 18 pounds, elephants 11 pounds, and dolphins 
3.5 pounds, whereas human brains average just over 3 pounds.
However, some very large animals, such as dinosaurs, lizards, and alligators, have 
relatively small brains compared to mammals as a function of body size. Across 
species, brains became generally bigger in mammals than nonmammals, and in 
primates compared to other mammals, and most recently, in humans compared 
to other primates.
Most of the increase in primate and human brain size is in the neocortex. For a 
given size, species that appear to behave in an intelligent way tend to have larger 
brains than those species that don’t. But, within a species, the correlation is weak 
between intelligence and brain size.
Processing speed
The other brain characteristic frequently mentioned as a foundation for intelli￾gence is processing speed or processing efficiency. This is particularly true for 
processing perceptually complex stimuli. Processing speed is related to how fast a 
person can execute a sequence of mental operations to accomplish some task.336 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Neural processing speed as it relates to IQ differences appears to be due to a vari￾ety of genetic factors. Individuals who score high on IQ tests tend also to score 
higher in speed of neural processing. High processing speed may be a cause of 
high IQ, or partly a result of it.
Understanding Consciousness
Consciousness is the 800-pound gorilla in the rooms of neurobiology, psychology, 
and philosophy. Many researchers carry on their research without acknowledging 
consciousness directly, but it’s always there. Perhaps only one species on earth 
has consciousness, and virtually every typical member of that species has it fully. 
What can today’s neurobiology say about it?
Consciousness is the state of realizing and understanding your surroundings and 
internal existence. Despite centuries of debate and analyses by scientists and phi￾losophers, consciousness remains familiar, mysterious, and controversial.
Without denying the existence of visual, auditory, and other sensory imagery that 
is nonverbal, most human consciousness is associated with internal verbalization. 
All humans conduct a running internal dialog that explains current reality, recalls 
past situations, and plans for future ones. Did language cause consciousness? The 
following sections discuss the potential role of language in consciousness.
Learning language instinctually
Prior to the age of about two years, human infants behave much like their closest 
relatives, the chimpanzees, though they’re less competent in motor activities 
such as moving and climbing. Then the language explosion begins! When humans 
are exposed to language, the language ability generally develops in the same 
ordered progression. Humans apply labels and sentences to objects in the world, 
to their relations, and to actions involving these objects — all without really get￾ting clear instruction. This is what the American linguist Steven Pinker called the 
language instinct.
The language instinct is ubiquitous in human brains and evolved rapidly in the 
past six million years. Imagine how strong the selection pressure must have been 
to master speech. Neuroscientists believe that the brain that evolved such a strong 
language instinct must have been compelled to classify and name objects, rela￾tionships, and actions.CHAPTER 17 Thinking About Intelligence, Language, and Lateralization 337
Developing internal language and 
consciousness
The need to name things was most likely used for person-to-person communica￾tion. What must have been invented next was subvocalization (talking to yourself 
in an inner voice without actually speaking). This may have occurred when an 
early hominid was about to speak but was interrupted. A brain that has the need 
to name objects and see object relations and actions in sentences has an internal 
monologue — that internal monologue is consciousness.
Inner-speech consciousness was mankind’s first digital invention. Speech is digi￾tal because it’s made up of a finite number of sounds (in each language) that are 
put together in groups to make words, with a small number of words forming 
sentences. Although you can modify the meaning of speech with your tone or 
style, the digital nature of speech means that every person can agree on a finite set 
of definitions and arrangements that everyone can understand. Internal speech is 
a running narrative explanation of reality — past, present, and future.
Theorizing consciousness
One big question is how consciousness arises in the brain. Before the 1990s, 
understanding consciousness was more of a philosophical quest than a neurosci￾ence one. In the 1990s Dr. David Chalmers distinguished between the easy and 
hard problems of consciousness:
» The easy problem addresses the functions and behaviors associated with 
consciousness and the neural correlates of consciousness: what brain regions, 
neurons, and neuronal activities are required. One fact that most neuroscien￾tists agree on it that there’s no one location in the brain where consciousness 
takes place nor is a single population of neurons responsible.
» The hard problem is the problem of explaining why and how humans have 
qualia-phenomenal experiences. It’s the problem of why and how humans 
have personal, first-person experiences, often described as experiences that 
feel “like something.”
Many theories about the biological and physical basis of consciousness have been 
developed with much controversy and debate in the field. A central debate per￾tains to whether activity in the prefrontal cortex plays an essential and/or central 
role in consciousness. Here are some current theories: 
» Global workspace theory (GWT): Developed by Dr. Bernard Baars and 
championed by Dr. Stanislas Dehaene, this theory proposes that the brain’s 338 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
prefrontal cortex, which controls higher order executive functions, acts as a 
central controller that collects and prioritizes information from sensory and 
other input. It then broadcasts the information to other parts of the brain that 
carry out tasks. This selection process is what is perceived as consciousness. 
It relates consciousness to cognitive abilities such as perception, attention, 
memory, and evaluation. GWT is a top-down explanation and predicts 
all-or-nothing responses.
» Integrated information theory (IIT): Proposed by Dr. Giulio Tononi, this 
theory proposes that consciousness arises from the interconnectedness of 
brain networks. The more neurons interact with one another, and the more 
complex the resulting network is, the more a being feels conscious — even 
without sensory input. IIT proponents suspect this process occurs in the back 
of the brain, with the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) proposed as the most 
important cortical region. IIT is a bottom-up explanation of consciousness. 
As an emergent property of neural complexity, it’s proposed to exist to 
different degrees that could be measured as a value (phi).
» Higher order theories (HOT): In this theory, a mental state is conscious by 
virtue of being the target of a certain kind of meta representational state. In 
HOT, consciousness arises when mental states are represented by higher 
order mental states. Higher levels of the brain, especially the prefrontal 
cortex, are implicated in HOT.
» Re-entry theory: Predictive processing proposes that conscious mental 
states are associated with top-down signaling. Top-down signaling involves 
processes by which higher-level brain regions (such as the prefrontal cortex) 
sends information about expectations to lower-level brain regions involved in 
bottom-up processing from sensory systems.CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 339

Brain Dysfunction in 
Developmental and 
Mental Disorders
The complexity of the human neocortex comes with costs: Many things can 
go wrong with such a complex system during development and in the adult 
brain, leading to problems with mental health. The way clinicians and 
researchers talk about mental health is evolving. Previously we used the term 
mental illness as a category for brain disorders that affect mental function. Because 
mental illness can imply disease and can be stigmatizing, many today prefer to 
talk about mental health issues or mental disorders, terms in which we use.
Both developmental and mental disorders can affect cognitive processes, emo￾tions, and behavior, and therefore these disorders are often grouped together. And 
clinically, individuals with developmental or mental disorders are usually treated 
by psychologists and/or psychiatrists. Developmental and mental disorders (and 
mental health issues) are probably the most costly and challenging health prob￾lems in the United States and worldwide.

What causes developmental and mental disorders? Most aren’t usually caused by 
an injury or infection, nor are most associated with a single genetic abnormality. 
(Here we define a genetic abnormality as a mutation in the DNA or structural change 
in a chromosome that significantly change the expression or function of a gene.) 
Instead, developmental and mental disorders include many kinds with many con￾tributing factors, including genetic abnormalities or susceptibility variants and 
environmental factors, including life experiences. In this chapter we cover the most 
common disorders known to involve brain dysfunction. We describe disorders that 
arise during development and then discuss mental disorders and their treatment.
Grasping Developmental and Mental 
Disorders as Brain Dysfunction
The genetic code used to build the brain (as well as the rest of the body) is often 
called a blueprint, but it’s really more like a computer program. Many genes 
encode proteins whose function is to regulate expression of other genes. Also, 
some genes encode ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that are used to regulate gene expres￾sion, rather than as codes for amino acid sequences in proteins. As the fertilized 
zygote divides repeatedly, the daughter cells differentiate into different tissue 
types that are determined by what subsets of genes are expressed. During devel￾opment, both intrinsic and environmental factors like chemicals or pathogens can 
affect cell differentiation.
Brain development is the product of both genetics and environmental factors. During 
the prenatal period, most of development is hard wired, meaning it’s governed by 
intrinsic gene expression programs that don’t require much interaction with the 
environment. However, exposure to toxic environmental conditions can lead to 
changes in prenatal development with serious outcomes. On the other hand, postna￾tal development involves gene expression that can also be controlled by interaction 
with the environment, leading to changes in synaptic function and neuronal activity.
The way development is talked about has also evolved. For clinicians and research￾ers the terms “normal” and “abnormal” generally aren’t considered useful terms 
because they can also infer cultural norms. Instead, many prefer terms such as 
“typical” or “standard” and “atypical” for use in a description or study. We use 
these terms as well. These sections briefly overview brain development and inter￾actions between genes and environment.
Building brains
Given that the brain is a product of genetics and environmental factors, a geneti￾cally typical DNA sequence interacts with typical experience to produce a typical CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 341
outcome — a functional brain without any brain dysfunction. An atypical DNA 
sequence paired with typical experience or a typical DNA sequence paired with 
atypical experience may lead to brain dysfunction.
Having the outcome of brain development depend on environmental factors and 
experience in a hostile and uncertain world may not seem like the best develop￾mental strategy from an evolutionary standpoint. However, this strategy exists 
because it’s possible to build a more complicated and competent organism for a 
particular environment. If the entire development is hard wired in the genome, as 
may be the case with invertebrates, the organism isn’t adaptable. The environ￾ment can affect organisms differently in the embryonic period, childhood, and 
adulthood.
Developing while growing
During embryonic and fetal growth, the brain increases in size and lays down its 
major structures and axon tracts. This process is highly susceptible to intrinsic 
genetic abnormalities, environmental drugs and toxins, and nutritional deficien￾cies. These issues may cause entire brain regions to be missing, malformed, or 
improperly connected. Toxins, nutritional deficiencies, and drugs that have no 
serious long-term ill effects in adults can have devastating effects on brain devel￾opment in utero.
Early childhood is another vulnerable period. During childhood, the processes of 
sculpting synapses and myelinating axon tracts in the brain are ongoing. Experi￾ence from sensory inputs and the outcome of behavior affect these processes. 
Engaging in a behavior to accomplish goals, like trying to walk, produces its own 
sensory input in a feedback loop that helps wire the brain to allow sensory control 
of behavior. During early childhood, the brain is highly malleable. Skills like lan￾guage and swimming are easily learned by children but much harder for adults. 
Other behaviors including social engagement and communication develop during 
childhood. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder who, because of differences 
in sensory systems and/or processing of facial expressions, may develop atypical 
social and/or communication skills.
Turning thoughts into synapses
For millennia through the first half of 20th century, people believed that after 
development, the adult brain was entirely fixed and unable to generate new neu￾rons or modify synapses and circuits. In the latter half of the century, scientists 
discovered that some synapses, such as those in the hippocampus, could be 
tweaked by experience and activity for encoding memory. And others observed 
that sensory deprivation could affect the neural organization in sensory areas. 342 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
However, this was thought to involve only a few neuronal populations and that 
producing new neurons or neural connections wasn’t possible in most of the 
brain.
New neurons can arise from neural progenitors in some parts of the adult brain, 
like the hippocampus. New synapses can be formed in many parts of the brain. 
And functional and structural changes in synapses (that affect synaptic transmis￾sion) may dynamically reconfigure the brain’s functional architecture in many 
brain regions. Together these are called neuroplasticity.
The idea of “use it or lose it” may apply to many cognitive functions. Because 
many cognitive capabilities enable others, a small positive or negative change in 
cognitive function can have far-reaching effects on the brain’s operation that can 
change its structure for better or worse. Thoughts, inspirations, trauma, near￾death experiences, and other strong emotional experiences can rewire the brain. 
And so can learning and practice.
Exploring Genetic Causes
Several genetic abnormalities can cause brain dysfunction. A few well-studied 
syndromes have a genetic basis that is understood in some detail. Some syn￾dromes are caused by mutations at a single DNA nucleotide, which changes the 
protein coded by one amino acid. Genetic mutations can occur by different mecha￾nisms, such as ionizing radiation, or errors in replication or transcription. Other 
genetic syndromes involve larger changes in the gene or chromosomal DNA and 
include insertions, deletions, or duplications.
Although there are currently no cures for development disorders caused by identi￾fied genetic abnormalities, early childhood intervention, through physical, occu￾pational, and behavioral therapies can help children with activities of daily living, 
social interactions, and learning.
Mutations in DNA nucleotides in a gene can change the amino acids within 
the protein coded by that gene. This can change the way the protein folds, its 
functional activity, its location, or stability, or all of these. A misfolded protein 
may not only fail to perform a necessary function in the brain, but it may itself 
be toxic. Here we describe how gene disruptions can affect neural cells and the 
four most common developmental disorders caused by identified genetic 
abnormalities.CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 343
Fragile X syndrome
Fragile X syndrome results from an expansion of a DNA sequence called the CGG 
repeat within the FMR1 (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1-FMRP) gene on 
the X chromosome. It’s the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. 
Intellectual disability is a term used when a person has certain limitations in cogni￾tive functioning and skills, including conceptual, social, and practical skills, such 
as language, social, and self-care skills. It’s associated clinically with an IQ score 
below 70.
Expansion of the CGG repeat part of the gene leads to deficiency of the FMRP. FMRP 
is an mRNA transport protein required to provide mRNAs for the synthesis of pro￾teins involved in neuronal functions and synaptogenesis. The other behavioral 
traits include learning disability, social anxiety, and an aversion to looking at 
faces (called gaze aversion). These behavior traits are associated with reduced 
function in the prefrontal areas of the brain.
Rett syndrome
Rett syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by a tendency toward 
microcephaly (small brain) and reduced levels of the neurotransmitters norepi￾nephrine and dopamine. It is caused by a mutation of a gene called MECP2 located 
on the X chromosome. The MECP2 protein is a transcriptional regulator shown to 
repress the expression of many genes; it may also activate expression of other 
genes. The syndrome affects females almost exclusively because affected males 
typically don’t survive in utero. Behavior traits include intellectual disability, poor 
verbal language skills, and repetitive hand wringing.
Williams syndrome
Williams syndrome is a rare developmental disorder that affects many parts of the 
body. It’s characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability, but strong 
language skills. It can be caused by a deletion of a number of different genes on 
chromosome 7, several of which are transcription factors. Individuals with 
Williams syndrome tend to be overly sociable and highly verbal. They typically 
have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, 
but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language and music.
Down syndrome
Down syndrome (also called trisomy 21) is caused by an extra chromosome 21 (or 
part of it). It’s the most common chromosomal abnormality. It occurs in more 344 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
than 1 in 1,000 births and is more common in children born of older parents due 
to the statistically greater chance of this chromosome duplication with aging. 
Down syndrome is associated with developmental delays and moderate to severe 
intellectual disability. It also produces complications in other organ systems that 
reduce life expectancy.
Linking Genetic and Environmental 
Factors
The majority of developmental disorders aren’t caused by a single genetic abnor￾mality but rather involve the interaction between genes and the environment. A 
genetic mutation is a change in the gene’s nucleotide sequence that leads to the loss 
of function or gain of a negative function in the protein it encodes. Genetic muta￾tions are rare in the population and can be dominant or recessive:
» Dominant mutations lead to disorder or disease even when the good copy 
is present.
» Recessive mutations are tolerated because one good copy of the gene is 
present that can perform the function.
Although the DNA of all humans is about 99.9 percent identical, small variations 
are present among genes that lead to differences in individuals, for example in 
blood type, eye color, and height. Genetic variants are common in the population 
and involve a difference in the gene’s nucleotide sequence that changes some 
aspect of the protein it encodes without having a disruptive effect. Less common 
gene variants can persist over many generations if they don’t provide an overall 
disadvantage compared to more common variants. The following focuses on the 
two most common developmental disorders, identified risk factors, and 
treatments.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by difficulty in 
sustaining attention, as well as hyperactivity and impulsivity. These symptoms 
are thought to result from executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation. 
ADHD is the most common developmental disability. It currently affects between 
5 to 8 percent of people in the United States. For most individuals, the causes of 
ADHD aren’t known, but several genetic and environmental risk factors interact 
to cause the disorder.CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 345
Environmental risk factors for ADHD include traumatic brain injury, exposure to 
toxins during pregnancy, and extreme postnatal nutritional deprivation. Because 
ADHD tends to run in families with a heritability rate of about 75 percent, genetic 
factors also play an important role. Susceptibility genes, which have mutations or 
variants, include genes that encode the dopamine receptor, proteins that control 
monoamine levels, and synaptic proteins. Nearly half of individuals diagnosed 
with ADHD in childhood will go on to have adult ADHD. Treatments for ADHD 
include medication, education, skills training, and psychological counseling. The 
most common medications include Ritalin (methylphenidate) and Adderall 
(amphetamine and dextroamphetamine), which control monoamine uptake and 
increase the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine at synapses (refer to 
Chapter 6).
Autism spectrum disorder
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the second most prevalent developmental dis￾ability affecting about 2 percent of children in the United States. The core symp￾toms of ASD are impaired social communication and restricted and repetitive 
patterns of behavior. Common specific symptoms include difficulty with social 
interactions and verbal and nonverbal communication, eye contact avoidance, 
rigid routines, hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, and repetitive movements. ASD 
is called a spectrum disorder because it can manifest very differently in each indi￾vidual. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and some individuals with ASD have 
other disorders, called comorbidities, such as epilepsy, ADHD, or intellectual 
disability.
Although the causes of ASD aren’t known, ASD involves interactions among sus￾ceptibility genes and environmental factors. The environmental factors include 
parental age, complications during pregnancy or birth, low birth weight, extreme 
prematurity, and exposure to viral infections or air pollution. More than a thou￾sand ASD susceptibility genes have been identified, which include gene mutations 
and gene variants.
There’s no cure for ASD. Early intervention services including behavioral, speech, 
and occupational therapy can help children with ASD gain self-care and social and 
language skills. Pharmacological treatments include risperidone and aripiprazole, 
which are atypical antipsychotic drugs. The field of psychiatry traditionally has 
classified ASD as a mental disorder. However, many people in the autism rights 
movement and ASD researchers view ASD as part of neurodiversity, the natural 
diversity in human cognition and experience, with differences between people 
with ASD and neurotypical individuals. Even if a cure for ASD is developed, many 
individuals with ASD wouldn’t want it.346 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Recognizing How the Environment Can 
Damage the Developing Brain
Developmental disorders can occur in a genetically typical brain if it suffers 
organic damage during development. Trauma, stress, toxins, and nutritional defi￾ciencies can all generate brain dysfunction. These injuries can be severe and irre￾versible if they happen to the embryo or fetus. Here we discuss two common 
injuries.
Substance-related syndromes
Several substances have the potential to compromise the neurological, mental, 
and physical health of developing babies if a mother misuses these substances. 
The most common is fetal alcohol syndrome, which develops from excessive 
alcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol exposure is a 
significant cause of intellectual disability, occurring in about 1 per 1,000 live 
births.
Alcohol readily crosses the placental barrier. In the developing fetus, alcohol can 
damage neurons and brain structures and is associated with varying degrees of 
cognitive and functional disability, such as attention and memory deficits, impul￾sive behavior, and stunted overall growth. Besides alcohol, exposure to prenatal 
cocaine and methamphetamine are statistically associated with mental and 
behavioral problems. Even excessive caffeine and nicotine (from cigarettes) or 
poor diets with vitamin or nutrient deficiencies may contribute to developmental 
disorders.
Maternal stress and infections
Chronic stress can lead to preterm birth or low birthweight, and the child has a 
higher risk of developmental disorders such as ADHD or ASD.  Maternal stress 
changes the mother’s hormone profile through the hypothalamic-pituitary￾adrenal (HPA) axis via the secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone that can affect the 
developing nervous system. Some of these effects may be long lasting, such as 
effects on hippocampal function.
Maternal viral infections, such as from rubella, can disrupt development of 
sensory systems and other circuits leading to hearing loss, visual impairment, or 
developmental disorders. Other viral infections such as HIV can be passed to the 
fetus. HIV infection can result in the baby being immunocompromised. HIV￾infected babies and children are at greater risk for infections and cancers and for 
developmental delay and disorders.CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 347
Combining Genes with Environment 
in Mental Disorders
The five most common and well-studied mental disorders are depression, schizo￾phrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), and epilepsy. These disorders have multiple causes, and the severity of 
symptoms varies greatly. They’re caused by complex interactions between genetic 
and environmental factors. Significant progress has been made in the 21st century 
using brain imaging, genetics, and systems neuroscience to understand what 
occurs in various kinds of mental disorders.
Depression
Depression includes several types of mood disorders. Clinically they’re called 
depressive disorders. The symptoms involve a depressed mood and loss of pleasure 
or interest in activities for long periods of time, and it can affect many aspects of 
daily life.
Approximately 10 to 15 percent of the U.S. general population is estimated to 
experience depression during their lifetime. It’s by far the most common mental 
disorder worldwide in terms of disability and total expense, costing more than an 
estimated $50 billion annually in the United States alone. People who have lived 
through severe loss, abuse, or other stressful events are more likely to develop 
depression. Worldwide, women are nearly twice as likely as men to be diagnosed 
with depression.
Here are some of the more common types of depressive disorders listed in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders (DSM-5):
» Major depressive disorder (single and recurrent episodes)
» Persistent depressive disorder
» Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
» Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern
» Major depressive disorder with peripartum onset
The common feature of depressive disorders is the presence of sad, empty, or 
irritable mood, along with changes, such as those in cognitive functions that 
affect a person’s capacity to function. What differs among these are duration, 
timing, contributing factors, and etiology.348 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Depression involves a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental 
factors. In this context, environmental factors refer to the physical, medical and 
emotional events, incidents and situations experienced over a lifetime.
Some types of depression have a strong genetic basis. A high incidence of depres￾sion can run in families and can be highly heritable without any known environ￾mental triggers. Depression can also occur in individuals from a single incident in 
people who hadn’t previously tend to be depressed. For example, someone may 
live into adulthood without any significant depression until a single traumatic 
experience occurs, such as the death of a loved one. Depression can also result 
from chronic lower-level stress. When depression is caused by environmental 
factors in what was before a nondepressed brain, clearly those factors produce 
changes in brain function in some way.
Since the 1950s, clinicians and researchers have proposed many ideas about what 
may happen in the brain to lead to depression. Here we discuss several of these 
ideas.
Early hypotheses about the etiology of depression
Initial hypotheses about depression were based on effects of drugs that affect 
monoamine neurotransmitters. These hypotheses were updated as more data 
became available about changes in the brain that occur in depression.
MONOAMINE HYPOTHESIS
In the late 1950s, two drugs were discovered by serendipity that improved the 
mood of patients with depression. The drugs had a common effect of acutely 
increasing monoamine levels. This led to the hypothesis that the basis of depres￾sion is depletion in the monoamines: serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopa￾mine in the brain. Monoamines are neurotransmitters. Their receptors are 
neuromodulators that work through second messenger signaling pathways lead￾ing to long-term changes in neurons.
This hypothesis was strengthened after the development in the 1980s of mono￾amine reuptake inhibitors to treat depression. Prozac is a selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI.  Other reuptake inhibitors can elevate the levels of 
norepinephrine and dopamine. The monoamine hypothesis also argued that spe￾cific monoamine deficits cause particular features of depression. Norepinephrine 
deficiency reduces alertness and energy; serotonin deficiency produces anxiety, 
obsessions, and compulsions; and low dopamine levels lead to lowered attention, 
motivation, and anhedonia (reduced feelings of pleasure).CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 349
BEYOND THE MONOAMINE HYPOTHESIS
Although monoamines systems are clearly affected in depression, scientific evi￾dence over the past three decades shows that the monoamine hypothesis is too 
simplistic and needs a serious overhaul.
Here’s some of the evidence: Depressed people don’t have abnormally low sero￾tonin levels. Drugs that deplete monoamine levels don’t cause depression in 
healthy people, nor do they worsen depressive symptoms in depressed people. 
People with genetic variants of serotonin transporters that increase transport 
have a reduced incidence of depression whereas people with variants that decrease 
transport have increased incidence of depression.
There’s a delayed onset of therapeutic effects of conventional antidepressants 
(two to six weeks) even though monoamine levels are rapidly restored. Following 
long-term antidepressant treatment, when therapeutic effects occur, mono￾amines return to pre-drug levels. Reuptake inhibitors are fully effective in less 
than half of patients. Several drugs with antidepressant effects don’t act directly 
through monoamine systems. And nondrug therapies including behavioral cogni￾tive therapy, exercise, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct 
current stimulation have antidepressant effects.
Brain dysfunction theories of depression
Numerous structural and functional changes in brain regions and brain networks 
correlate with depression. This suggests that more global changes in synaptic 
transmission and neuronal circuit activity could be involved in depression. Here 
we explore these theories in greater detail.
BRAIN REGIONS AFFECTED IN DEPRESSION
Human functional imaging (fMRI) studies and analysis of postmortem human 
brain have shown changes in specific regions of the brain that correlated with 
depression. Here are some brain regions affected:
» Cerebral cortex and hippocampus: Human fMRI studies have shown 
anomalies and/or thinning in the orbitofrontal cortex, middle prefrontal 
cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex in 
individuals with depression. In some people, increased activity in the amyg￾dala and posterior parietal cortex were observed. Postmortem studies show a 
decrease in volume (most likely because of decreased dendrites, synapses, 
and glia) in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and hippocampus of 
depressed subjects. In some subjects an increase in volume in the amygdala 
was observed.350 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
» Raphe nuclei: Located in the upper brainstem, raphe nuclei are the primary 
location of serotonin neuron cell bodies that project axons throughout the 
brain. Depression is often associated with abnormally low activity in the dorsal 
raphe nuclei.
» Ventral tegmental area: Located in the midbrain, this area is a major part of 
the brain’s reward system. Dopaminergic neurons in this area project to the 
nucleus accumbens and frontal lobe. Long-term stress decreases dopamine 
release in the nucleus accumbens.
» Subgenual cingulate: This area appears to be overactive in some types of 
depression. It may keep the sufferer stuck in a feedback loop in which 
negative, self-focused thoughts reinforce themselves. Deep brain stimulation 
(which we discuss in the section “Electrical brain stimulation” later this 
chapter) in this area has had success in alleviating depression.
NETWORK HYPOTHESIS
The brain areas in the previous section communicate through important networks 
to generate attention, perception, emotion, cognition, and behavior. Another the￾ory is that changes in connectivity among brain regions and dysfunction at the 
network level is the basis of depression.
The network hypothesis predicts that a number brain regions involving several 
neurotransmitter systems are involved in depression. Functional imaging studies 
have identified seven large-scale brain networks based on connectivity and mutual 
activity. Three of the best studied networks are the default mode network, salience 
network, and central executive network.
Researchers are using fMRI to examine if these networks are affected in individu￾als with neurological or mental disorders. Differences in activity in all three net￾works have been observed in subjects with depression compared with nondepressed 
controls. Default mode network activity has been linked to the tendency of indi￾viduals with depression to ruminate (engage in self-focused negative thinking).
Genes and environment in depression
Depression involves an interaction between genes and environmental factors. 
Many genetic variants contribute to depression susceptibility, including genes 
involved in monoamine systems and synaptic structure and function. What are 
the environmental factors that contribute to the development of depression? And 
what can these reveal about underlying causes of depression?CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 351
EARLY ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS FOR DEPRESSION
Stressful early life experiences can impact brain development, leading to long￾term functional changes that may contribute to lifelong vulnerability for develop￾ing depression. Early environmental risk factors include in utero  exposure to 
infection, lack of nutrients, and maternal stress. In childhood and adolescence, 
risk factors include malnourishment, maltreatment, and abuse. Stressful early 
experiences can also affect adaptive mechanisms required to deal with challenges 
in adulthood.
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
DEPRESSION
In adolescence and adulthood, depression can be triggered by traumatic physical 
or emotional events or illness. For some people,  an upsetting or stressful life 
event, such as bereavement, divorce, illness, traumatic accident, physical or sex￾ual abuse, job loss, or family or money worries can be the cause. Different causes 
can often combine to trigger depression. A shared effect produced by these events 
is chronic stress.
Stress involves activation of the HPA axis:
» The hypothalamus (H) receives inputs from sensory, emotional, and memory 
brain regions.
» In response to a traumatic physical, emotional, or stressful event, the 
hypothalamus activates the pituitary (P) to release a hormone called ACTH 
(adrenocorticotropic hormone).
» ACTH travels in the blood to the adrenal (A) gland where it stimulates the 
release of the stress hormone cortisol into the blood. Cortisol affects many 
organs, including the brain.
Small acute increases in cortisol are good to increase energy and lower fatigue in 
emergency situations. But chronic stress and elevated cortisol can lead to changes 
in neurons and glia. In neurons, cortisol binds to glucocorticoid receptors that 
control gene expression. Cortisol also increases brain inflammation, and inflam￾matory mediators can affect microglia, astrocytes, and neurons.
The neuroplasticity hypothesis
Research studies in rodent models show that placing an animal in a stressful 
physical or psychological situation over time leads to a chronic stress response 
with elevated cortisol. These animals develop depression-like behaviors, reflect￾ing symptoms in human depression. These studies support the conclusion that 
chronic stress is a significant causal factor in the development of depression.352 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
In the rodent chronic stress studies, examination of the brain showed significant 
changes. These include a thinning of the gray matter in the neocortex and 
decreased volume in the hippocampus, similar to changes seen in humans with 
depression. At a microscopic level in neurons, there were decreases in dendritic 
spines and synapses and less neurogenesis. In functional studies, chronically 
stressed animals showed reduced synaptic plasticity called long-term potentia￾tion (LTP) in the hippocampus.
The effects observed in rodent models, especially on synaptic plasticity, and in 
human studies, are consistent with a reduction in the processes that underlie 
neuroplasticity. This has led to the hypothesis that chronic stress and depression 
involve the dysregulation of neuroplasticity. The recent discovery of rapid antide￾pressant effects of drugs called psychoplastogens that increase or restore neuro￾plasticity support this hypothesis.
Novel pharmacological treatments: 
psychoplastogens
Psychoplastogens are a group of small molecule drugs that can produce rapid and 
often sustained effects on neuronal structure and function, and rapid therapeutic 
benefits. Though they act through different initial mechanisms, several psycho￾plastogens have been shown in initial small clinical trials to have effective and 
rapidly acting antidepressant action. Psychoplastogens have less addiction poten￾tial than originally thought, and many are in more extensive clinical trials for 
treatment of a variety of mental disorders.
Here are some psychoplastogens being studied in clinical trials:
» Ketamine: This drug was initially developed as an anesthetic. Also known as a 
recreational drug, ketamine also has rapid antidepressant effects within a day 
and is often tested for treatment-resistant depression. A challenge for the use 
of ketamine is the limited time of antidepressant effects (about a week). 
Ketamine has been shown to be an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist. It 
has also been proposed to increase BDNF levels and enhance BDNF recep￾tor activity.
» MDNA: One study has shown that in people with a predisposition to depres￾sion, treatment with MDMA, also known as the party drug ecstasy, caused a 
significant reduction in depressive symptoms. Also rapidly acting, MDMA 
binds to monoamine reuptake transporters and vesicular storage transport￾ers. MDMA enhances release and/or blocks reuptake of presynaptic sero￾tonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 353
» Hallucinogens: Humans have used hallucinogens ritualistically for millennia. 
Hallucinogens are psychoactive, meaning they change a person’s awareness of 
their surroundings and alter thoughts and feelings. They can cause mystical 
experiences and hallucinations, the perception that images or sounds are real 
when they aren’t actually present. Here are types of hallucinogens:
• LSD: This drug was the first hallucinogenic synthesized in the 1950s.
• Psylocibin: A naturally occurring hallucinogen, it’s produced by many 
species of mushrooms. Psilocybin-assisted therapy can produce a rapid 
and significant improvement in depressive symptoms, lasting for at least 
six months. DMT can be extracted from several plant species. Ayahuasca is 
a combination of DMT and a plant extract containing monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors.
These drugs have a common mechanism acting as serotonin receptor 
agonists, specifically at 5HT2A serotonin receptors.
Identifying nonpharmacological therapies
Antidepressant drugs are the most commonly used and widely prescribed first line 
treatments for depression. Because some individuals have treatment-resistant 
depression, nonpharmacological therapies for depression have been developed 
over the past few decades. Here is a description of some current therapies.
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT)
CBT is an evidence-based psychological intervention for the treatment of mental 
disorders, including depression. CBT is a problem-focused and action-oriented 
form of talk therapy. One goal of CBT treatment is to challenge and change think￾ing patterns and their associated behaviors. In depression, negative feelings or 
emotions can create negative memories that when recalled lead to a feedback loop 
of negative thoughts.
Two strategies of CBT include the following:
» Break this feedback cycle by identifying the distortions in thinking that are 
creating problems and reevaluating them.
» Get a better understanding of the behavior and motivation of others.
These can lead to improved emotional regulation and development of coping 
strategies and problem solving. If CBT can restore neuroplasticity in depression, 
it is amazing that a person’s conversations and thoughts can change their brain.354 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
ELECTRICAL BRAIN STIMULATION
Here are treatments for brain electrical stimulation:
» Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): It involves creating a millisecond, 
high-field magnetic pulse over a particular brain area via an external coil that 
produces currents inside the brain underneath the coil. Some clinical success 
has been achieved in treating depression with TMS.
» Deep brain stimulation: It involves placing electrodes in brain regions. 
Current pulses of certain frequencies have been shown to reduce depression 
symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression.
» Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): ECT involves passing electric currents 
through the brain via scalp electrodes to induce transient seizure activity. ECT 
has been shown to be effective in some individuals for the relief of treatment￾resistant depression.
EXERCISE
People who exercise regularly report have better mental health and emotional 
wellbeing and lower rates of mental disorders. Exercise may reduce the risk of 
developing mental disorders. Exercise can also help in treating depression. Regu￾lar exercise may help improve mood by increasing the body’s feel-good chemi￾cals, including endocannabinoids and endogenous opioids (refer to Chapters  6 
and 15).
Exercise can also impact depression by enhancing neuroplasticity. Exercise leads 
to the release of myokines from muscle. One myokine called irisin can act on 
many tissues, including the brain. Irisin increases the levels of BDNF in the brain 
and is suggested to enhance neuroplasticity.
Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by disordered thought, paranoia, 
and delusional beliefs. It occurs in about 1 percent of the population worldwide 
and is associated with significant social dysfunction and disability. People with 
severe cases of schizophrenia are often hospitalized. Here we delve deeper into 
what you need to know about schizophrenia.
People often confuse the two, but schizophrenia is not the same as dissociative 
identity disorder.CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 355
Recognizing symptoms
Symptoms of schizophrenia typically appear in young adulthood, and they fall 
into two general categories:
» Positive symptoms: These are active processes that include hallucinations or 
delusions such as hearing voices, seeing images or feeling, smelling, or tasting 
things that don’t exist outside the mind. They can affect behavior or thoughts. 
Brain scans of individuals with schizophrenia show activity in their auditory 
cortex during auditory hallucinations. This suggests that an internal source in 
the brain is generating activity in areas that the individual can’t distinguish 
from something actually sensed.
» Negative symptoms: Mostly these symptoms are withdrawal and an inability 
to engage in social interactions, characterized by flat affect and emotion, 
anhedonia, loss of motivation, social withdrawal, and lack of attention to 
hygiene and routine activities of life. Although positive symptoms are harder 
to manage when patients act out delusional ideas, negative symptoms tend to 
contribute more to poor quality of life.
Examining the genetic basis
The typical age of onset of schizophrenia is young adulthood, when myelination 
in the frontal lobe is being completed. This is the last major stage of axonal mye￾lination during development. Schizophrenia appears to be dysfunction of the 
frontal lobe that has strong heritability.
The genetic basis of schizophrenia is apparent in the fact that if one identical twin 
has schizophrenia, the other twin has a 40 percent chance of developing the dis￾order, even if the other twin was raised separately. Moreover, known subclinical 
traits in schizophrenia, like a particular kind of abnormal eye tracking, occur fre￾quently in close relatives of people with schizophrenia.
Identifying treatment options
Pharmacological treatments for alleviating positive symptoms of schizophrenia 
have improved in the last decades. Negative symptoms still don’t respond well to 
most current medications. Researchers are unclear why some drugs work better in 
some patients with schizophrenia than others for positive symptoms and why 
none of them alleviates negative symptoms well.
Most individuals with schizophrenia are treated with typical or atypical antipsy￾chotic medications. Many of these drugs preferentially affect the dopaminergic 356 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
system to decrease positive symptoms. Unfortunately these drugs can have seri￾ous side effects. Some antipsychotics may also increase acetylcholine levels or 
enhance serotonin function with less effect on dopamine.
Nicotine, as from cigarettes, is a nicotinic receptor agonist, and cigarette smok￾ing, as a form of self-medication, is prevalent among people with schizophrenia. 
Research suggests a specific mutation in the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptor acts as a major molecular genetic susceptibility for schizophrenia.
Recent evidence suggests that abnormally low numbers of NMDA glutamate 
receptors are involved in schizophrenia. Postmortem analysis of the brains of 
patients with schizophrenia show reduced receptor numbers compared to normal. 
NMDA receptor–blocking drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine mimic 
schizophrenia symptoms, and the hallucinogen LSD has similar effects to 
ketamine.
Obsessive compulsive disorders
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by intru￾sive thoughts that generate repetitive behaviors to alleviate the anxiety related to 
the intrusive thoughts. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is marked 
by an intense focus on perfection, order, and control. About 2 percent of the popu￾lation have OCD or OCPD symptoms.
Typical symptoms of OCD include washing excessively (particularly hand wash￾ing), repeatedly checking for something undone or missing, and performing ever￾yday activities — such as dining or washing — in a ritualistic way. OCD is also 
associated with traits such as hoarding, preoccupation with sexual or religious 
thoughts, and irrational aversions, such as extreme fear of germs. Extreme cases 
of OCD are associated with paranoia and psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia (see our discussion in the previous section), however, people 
with OCD are typically aware of their obsessions and usually find them distress￾ing, although they’re unable to stop.
Some OCD has been linked to an abnormal serotonin neurotransmission, some￾times successfully treated with SSRIs. Mutations in genes linked to serotonin have 
been identified in some individuals with OCD, but a strong genetic basis for its 
occurrence hasn’t been identified. The genetic basis may be a susceptibility that 
environmental factors act on to produce the disorder.CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 357
Posttraumatic stress disorder
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that develops after 
psychological trauma — such as experiencing a war or sexual abuse — that over￾whelms the person’s coping ability. Traumatic psychological events cause an 
overactive adrenaline response that persists after the event, making a person 
hyperresponsive to future fearful situations.
PTSD is associated with low basal cortisol levels and high catecholamine secre￾tion, characteristic of the classic fight-or-flight response. It may have a genetic 
susceptibility associated with differences in GABA receptors and is associated with 
having a smaller than normal hippocampus.
People prone to PTSD are also statistically more likely to have generalized anxiety 
disorders; a tendency toward alcohol, nicotine, and drug misuse; and a history of 
abuse as children.
Desensitization therapies, which involve paring systematic re-exposure with relax￾ation techniques in a carefully controlled environment, can sometimes mitigate 
some of its effects. Preliminary studies have shown effectiveness of the psycho￾plastogens ketamine and MDMA in the treatment of PTSD.
Epilepsy
Epilepsy is when seizures occur in the brain. Seizures are incidents of hypersyn￾chronous neural activity during which normal brain function is severely compro￾mised. The underlying cause of epilepsy is usually a dysfunctional brain area 
where the seizures originate and then spread to the rest of the brain. These 
seizure-originating areas are called epileptic foci. They occur commonly in the 
temporal lobe but can exist anywhere in the brain.
Most initial treatment for epilepsy use drugs called anticonvulsants. Most of the 20 
or so anticonvulsants approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are 
aimed at increasing GABA transmission in the brain. About 70 percent of patients 
experience a reduction of seizures with one or more of these drugs.
For individuals with epilepsy in which anticonvulsants do not work, or those who 
can’t tolerate the negative drug side effects, surgery is an option. In epilepsy sur￾gery, the surgical team tries to locate the focus of the seizure and remove it with￾out damaging important nearby brain areas, particularly those associated with 
language.358 PART 3 Understanding Perception and Cognition
Eating and Drinking for Brain Function
The foods you eat and the liquids you drink contain many substances that can 
affect brain activity and function. Well-known substances include caffeine, alco￾hol, and nicotine. Nutritional supplements and even the balance of fat versus meat 
versus vegetables in the diet can affect neurotransmitter balances in the brain 
with cognitive and behavioral results as we discuss in these sections.
Considering naturally occurring 
psychoactive substances
Nutrition, neuroactive substances, and drugs can have significant effects on brain 
function, for good or bad. These substances can be ingested from plants or pills. 
Many drugs and supplements act by mimicking neurotransmitters, while others 
modulate cell metabolism or membrane function.
Naturally occurring psychoactive substances have been used in religious rituals 
for thousands of years. Notable examples include peyote (mescaline) and psilocy￾bin, which activate serotonin receptors to produce hallucinations and euphoria. 
Cannabinoids in marijuana activate receptors called CB1 and CB2 in the brain’s 
pain and immune control systems. There are also naturally occurring cholinergic 
antagonists from plants, such as the deadly nightshade and mandrake, which are 
hallucinogenic.
Feeding the brain properly
Healthy brain activity depends on a healthy body, including its cardiovascular 
system. Nutrition and exercise that promote general health tend to promote brain 
health.
Some vitamins are thought to enhance brain function or slow its decline with 
aging. These include the B vitamins, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and 
isoflavones.
Certain agents, sometimes called nootropics, are thought to specifically enhance 
some brain functions such as cognition, memory, intelligence, motivation, atten￾tion, and concentration. These are variously called smart drugs, memory enhancers, 
neuroenhancers, cognitive enhancers, and intelligence enhancers.
Most so-called smart drugs work by mimicking neurotransmitters, altering their 
endogenous levels, or antagonizing receptors. Many are derived from drugs used 
to treat neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease, CHAPTER 18 Brain Dysfunction in Developmental and Mental Disorders 359
such as L-dopa, the precursor to dopamine. Other dopamine agents include 
modafinil, L-phenylalanine L-tyrosine, biopterin, and pyridoxal-phosphate.
Some psychiatric drugs such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, used for ADHD) are 
taken in the belief that they increase productivity without producing euphoria or 
psychosis. Some common supplements include resveratrol (an MAO-A inhibitor), 
St. John’s wort (an herbal supplement used for mild depression), ginseng, kava, 
co-enzyme Q-10 (an antioxidant), creatine (which modulates ATP levels), and 
ginkgo biloba and vincamine (which are vasodilators).
Needless to say, mucking around with your brain and nervous system without a 
thorough knowledge of the effects of these agents and without being able to mon￾itor neurotransmitter and receptor levels is potentially very dangerous. Many of 
the agents we describe here have been used as herbal medication in other coun￾tries for some time, so at least they have a history of use to look at. If you take any 
supplement, do so carefully and under the advice of a physician.
Looking at commonly misused drugs
People misuse drugs that affect the brain for many different reasons. Often, tak￾ing drugs is a way to self-medicate that is habit forming. Here are some com￾monly misused substances:
» Stimulants: Some stimulants, such as amphetamines and methamphet￾amines, are initially taken to enhance productivity but end up causing 
addiction and psychosis.
» Nicotine: Taken in from cigarette smoking, vaping, or patches, nicotine can 
have short-term positive effects on alertness, attention, memory, and fine 
motor control. It seems to reduce some schizophrenic symptoms. However, 
cigarettes produce scores of toxic by-products that lead to lung cancer, 
emphysema, and vascular system damage.
» Caffeine: Commonly ingested in coffee and tea, caffeine increases energy 
and alertness. It has a marginal paradoxical protective effect against 
Parkinson’s disease, for unknown reasons.
» Other substances: Some drugs are taken only for euphoria, of course. These 
include dopaminergic agents such as cocaine, heroin, ecstasy (MDMA), and to 
a lesser extent marijuana, a cannabinoid. These drugs and alcohol are 
frequently misused although the potential varies among individuals.4

Ten Most Important 
Neural Circuits
Neurons are organized in ensembles called neural networks or circuits that 
process information. In a circuit, a group of neurons are interconnected by 
synapses to produce a specific function when activated. Information often 
flows in from one place, through the circuit and out in another place. Circuits can 
be simple and local, containing a small group of neurons in close proximity with 
one input and one output. Or they can be more complex and long distance, involv￾ing integration of information from several areas with an output to different 
regions. The diversity of neural circuit types has also been studied, identifying 
diverging, converging, reverberating, and after-discharge circuits. This diversity 
contributes to the broad scope of neural functions. Interconnected neural circuits 
form large scale brain networks.
The term association cortex first arose in the mid 20th century from the idea that 
the neocortex was a nondifferentiated device for learning stimulus-response con￾tingencies. In this early view, neural connectivity was initially random and non￾specialized. Research has now shown that connections between cortical areas and 
subcortical areas are highly specific. Damage to particular areas of the brain 
causes specific loss of function. After injury, plasticity mechanisms can often 
reorganize synapses and circuits to overcome problems associated with the dam￾age, but sometimes not. This chapter describes ten particularly important circuits 
in the brain and their functions.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Listing major neural circuits
» Seeing what these ten brain 
circuits do364 PART 4 The Part of Tens
The Reticular Formation
The reticular formation is an ancient brainstem circuit that extends throughout 
much of the medulla, pons, and midbrain, and into the thalamus. It’s continuous 
with the intermediate gray matter of the spinal cord and is organized in a similar 
manner.
The word reticular is from the Latin for “net.” Refer to Chapter 10 for more about 
the reticular formation.
The reticular formation consists of more than 100 interconnected neural circuits 
that control essential body functions and life processes such as sleep, wakefulness 
and consciousness, heart rate, breathing, temperature, pain modulation, and 
somatic motor control. Significant damage to the reticular formation typically 
results in death.
The reticular formation projects to the thalamus and neocortex to control states of 
consciousness, awareness, and sleep-wake cycles via the reticular activating 
system (RAS). The cerebral cortex requires input from the RAS to maintain aware￾ness and arousal. Minor or moderate damage to the RAS can result in loss of con￾sciousness and coma.
The reticular formation is also the origin of two descending motor pathways called 
the reticulospinal tracts. These tracts control posture, balance, and tone, and are 
also involved in locomotion.
Somatic Reflexes
Somatic reflexes are the simplest neural circuits. The spinal cord and brainstem 
reflexes enable the body to adjust rapidly to sudden changes in the environment. 
Reflexes are rapid, involve sensory input and motor output, and don’t require 
higher brain control. Chapter 7 describes somatic reflexes.
Here are a few examples of spinal reflexes:
» Withdrawal reflex: A stimulus (for example, burning your hand) immediately 
causes a movement (withdrawing your hand from the stove). The axon 
terminals of pain receptor neurons synapse on and directly activate motor 
neurons in the spinal cord. The pain axons simultaneously activate inter￾neurons to relax the opposing muscle.CHAPTER 19 Ten Most Important Neural Circuits 365
» Knee jerk reflex: Stimulation of the patellar tendon/ligament with a small 
hammer stretches the spindles in the nearby quadriceps muscle, leading to 
contraction of the quadriceps and kicking out the lower leg and foot. This 
reflex is involved in posture and balance and also contributes to locomotion.
For brainstem reflexes the integrating unit and motor neurons are located in the 
brainstem. Numerous brainstem reflexes control eye movements. Other reflexes 
include the jaw jerk, gag, and cough reflex. In the cough reflex, stimulation of 
receptors in the respiratory tract by foreign particles like dust or mucus sends 
signals to the medulla. Activation of motor neurons sends signals to contract 
muscles that produce the cough.
Some reflexes can be modulated or suppressed. You can override a spinal reflex if 
you know in advance that the stimulus will occur. If you’re climbing a rope, the 
pain in your hands may trigger a reflex to let go, but your brain, knowing that let￾ting go would be even more dangerous, may override this reflex. You can suppress 
a cough for a short period, but not for very long if a strong irritant is present.
Central Pattern Generators
Spinal cord and brainstem circuits produce the basic rhythmic patterns for loco￾motion or movements called central pattern generators (CPGs). Once initiated, CPGs 
depend on intrinsic properties of the CPG neurons and their connections, operat￾ing without motor commands from higher brain areas. Chapter 9 describes CPGs.
CPGs are found in invertebrates and vertebrates in many regions of the nervous 
system. Many CPGs normally produce rhythmic patterned outputs with sensory 
feedback, suggesting that pattern generators operate in a stimulus-reflex￾movement-stimulus cycle. However, CPGs are capable of generating locomotion 
patterns without sensory feedback.
Sensory feedback does help coordinate efficient locomotion in the limbs. For 
example, the brain controls the activity of spinal CPGs via descending axonal 
projections that constitute high-level commands — such as switching of gaits — 
while the spinal cord neural circuitry takes care of details — like adjusting gait for 
stepping in holes or when running on slopes.
CPGs for locomotion are distributed throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar 
spinal cord. These circuits produce motor neuron firing–patterns that synchro￾nize rhythmic contractions of flexor-extensor muscles of the forelimbs and hind 
limbs. As the hind limbs move in antiphase with each other, the forelimbs move 
in the opposite antiphase, so your right arm goes forward at the same time as 
your left leg.366 PART 4 The Part of Tens
Top-down control from the brain takes advantage of inputs from the visual and 
vestibular systems. Your visual system helps to keep you from running into trees. 
Your vestibular system compensates for stepping in holes and generates the 
proper leaning posture if you’re running on a slope. CPGs are especially important 
for controlling your balance in these cases.
CPGs use neural circuits in which activity in half of the circuit increases while the 
other half decreases. This alternating phase activity is believed to be based on 
circuits of neurons that are mutually inhibitory — one leg extends while the other 
flexes. These oscillators extend throughout the spinal cord and can receive both 
sensory input and cortical modulation.
Thalamic Relay to the Cortex
The thalamus is at the center of a neural hub whose spokes go to and from the 
neocortex and subcortical structures. The thalamus is not only the gateway to 
the cerebral cortex, but it’s also an intrinsic part of nearly all cortical circuits. 
The thalamus receives inputs from all the senses, as well as the basal ganglia 
and cerebellum for motor control, and the reticular formation (refer to the 
section “The Reticular Formation” earlier in this chapter). Parts 2 and 3 describe 
other thalamic circuits.
The output of the thalamus makes a fast, efficient link among all four cerebral 
lobes that parallels, and to some extent, can short-circuit pathways within the 
neocortex between different areas. This means that the thalamus is controlling 
the flow and processing of information throughout the brain by integrating the 
output of cortical and subcortical processing. This makes the thalamus not just a 
relay, but a true controller. Thalamic integration is essential for attention, aware￾ness, and consciousness.
Cerebellar Coordination
The cerebellum is an evolutionarily old part of the vertebrate brain. Unlike other 
areas like the brainstem, the cerebellum increased in size and neuron number as 
the neocortex expanded during evolution.
The cerebellum modulates and coordinates motor behavior. Its neural circuitry 
detects errors between what is programmed for a particular movement and what 
is executed. This depends on detection of variables like loads and uneven ground 
while walking. It uses error computation to achieve correct sequences in motor 
behavior based on practice. Chapter 8 discusses cerebellar circuits and functions.CHAPTER 19 Ten Most Important Neural Circuits 367
The cerebellum achieves its capabilities by learning. When you first learn to throw 
a baseball, you have to think about what you’re doing and consciously adapt to 
your mistakes. Eventually the process becomes automatic because the sequence 
has become programmed by cerebellar circuits.
The cerebellum also plays an important role in cognition that involves spatial 
relations and movement. If you plan to rearrange the furniture in your house, the 
cerebellum is activated during this planning. Through connections with language 
areas and the prefrontal cortex, the cerebellum also plays a role in language func￾tion and social cognition.
Hippocampal Circuitry and Activation 
with the Cortex
The hippocampus is part of a brain circuit that encodes declarative and spatial 
memories (refer to Chapter 15). The hippocampus receives inputs from the entire 
neocortex (through a region called the entorhinal cortex) and subcortical areas and 
sends outputs back to the neocortex and other regions.
Within the hippocampal circuit, incoming activity to the dentate gyrus neurons 
activates CA3 neurons, which then activate CA1 neurons. This leads to changes in 
synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons, called synaptic plasticity, which is an under￾pinning of learning and memory. However, the hippocampus is only a temporary 
memory store, and it must transfer information from CA1 neurons to neocortical 
circuits for long-term storage.
Current models propose that during memory consolidation, the hippocampus 
sends signals back to the neocortical areas that were originally activated by the 
event itself. This signaling most likely occurs during rehearsal and sleep. 
The result of the signaling is that the memories, which were stored temporarily 
in the hippocampus, produce long-term changes in the neocortical areas and 
circuits that were activated during the original stimulus.
The Amygdala Orbitofrontal Cortex Loop
Next to the hippocampus is the amygdala. The amygdala connects with the neo￾cortex, and like the hippocampus it’s implicated in encoding long-term memory. 
The amygdala is particularly involved with processing stimuli and encoding 368 PART 4 The Part of Tens
memories for experiences that have high emotional salience, such as danger and 
fear. Chapters 10 and 15 describe the amygdala functions and circuitry.
The amygdala projects to the orbitofrontal cortex (an area within the prefrontal 
cortex), as well as to the hypothalamus and other brain areas associated with 
emotional reactions to stimuli. The orbitofrontal cortex is involved in sensory 
integration, modulation of visceral reactions, and learning for prediction and 
decision-making for emotional behaviors.
Researchers have studied the encoding of fear memories in animal models of fear 
conditioning, where a context that predicts some painful outcome becomes asso￾ciated with the outcome and itself induces fear. The amygdala also receives con￾nections back from the orbitofrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, most 
likely for the regulation of emotion.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
have been linked to changes in the amygdala. Lesions to the anterior temporal 
lobe that include the amygdala can produce hypo-emotionality, loss of fear, and 
hypersexuality. Imaging studies showed a significant decrease in amygdala volume 
in individuals with antisocial personality disorder.
The Conscious Triangle
The thalamus, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe are almost always activated during con￾sciousness. Moreover, their activity is also likely to be highly coupled, as coherent 
EEG rhythms and synchronous neural firing show. Refer to Chapter 17 for more 
information on the current hypothesis about the basis of consciousness. So why 
these three brain regions?
The prefrontal cortex is the main brain area responsible for working memory, 
which is the mental representation of what’s most important about your current 
situation. It’s also involved in attention and abstract thought. The orbitofrontal, 
anterior cingulate, and insular cortices may support emotional aspects of 
consciousness.
The thalamus links the neocortex to subcortical structures and the areas of neo￾cortex together. By controlling the activity of the neocortex, the thalamus appears 
to control what emerges from the vast amount of subconscious neural activity as 
conscious, accessible thought. One hypothesis is that conscious brain activity 
requires a time and magnitude threshold. Enough neurons must be active over a 
large enough region of the brain for at least half a second for conscious awareness 
to occur and persist.CHAPTER 19 Ten Most Important Neural Circuits 369
The posterior parietal cortex is the seat of the convergence of somatosensory, 
visual, and auditory sensory streams that allow you to locate yourself in the world 
and be aware of this location. The posterior parietal cortex is connected to the 
prefrontal cortex in the central executive network. Together these areas provide a 
representation of the context of where and why you’re here. These areas are regu￾lated by the thalamus. Activity in this network may be what crosses the threshold 
required for consciousness.
The Basal Ganglia Thalamus Loop
The basal ganglia are controllers of behavior, using the neocortex to generate 
alternative motor plans and the cerebellum to help carry them out (refer to 
Chapter 8). The basal ganglia receive inputs to their outer nuclei, the caudate and 
putamen (together called the striatum). The striatum projects to the inner nuclei, 
mainly the globus pallidus. The output of the basal ganglia is chiefly from its inner 
nuclei to the motor nuclei of the thalamus that connects to the motor cortex. 
Activity in the basal ganglia increases or decreases the thalamic output to motor 
areas that generate commands for producing motor behavior. The other nuclei of 
the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra and subthalamic nuclei, perform a crucial 
modulatory role in this system.
The basal ganglia select current actions across an entire behavioral action sequence 
that is typically initiated in the prefrontal cortex. The basal ganglia receive inputs 
about the state of the body with respect to the current goal being sought from 
sensory cortices and the cerebellum, primarily through the thalamus. The basal 
ganglia select among behavioral alternatives along the entire motor sequence by 
projecting to the thalamus that then projects to appropriate regions of the motor 
cortex to choose the next action in the sequence.
The Cingulate and Pulvinar Executives
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) lies on the medial surface of each frontal lobe 
and plays key roles in cognitive, motor, and emotional processing (refer to 
Chapter 8 and 16). The ACC comprises the anterior half of the cingulate gyrus. It’s 
mesocortex, a phylogenetically earlier type of cortex that evolved in the earliest 
mammals. The ACC receives inputs from the thalamus and the neocortex and 
projects to the entorhinal cortex, the input region for the hippocampus.
The ACC controls neural processing throughout the neocortex, allocating this pro￾cessing according to task demands, making it a modulator of executive function. 370 PART 4 The Part of Tens
The ACC is implicated in subjective experience associated with consciousness, 
particularly consciousness of pain. It’s also one of the brain regions underlying 
empathy. The ACC, together with the insula, is part of the salience network, a 
network involved in detecting and determining the importance of external and 
internal stimuli.
The posterior cingulate cortex also interacts with the prefrontal cortex, as part of the 
default mode network. This network is active when you’re at wakeful rest when 
daydreaming, thinking about yourself or others, or remembering the past.
The pulvinar (see Chapter  8), a nucleus in the most posterior region of the 
thalamus, has widespread connections with all the neocortex. It’s an important 
mediator of attention, particularly visual attention and eye movements associated 
with it. The pulvinar integrates vision and goal pursuit to generate context￾specific motor responses to specific visual stimuli and ignoring irrelevant 
visual stimuli.CHAPTER 20 Ten Technologies Revolutionizing Brain Science 371

Revolutions are occurring today in neurobiology. Genetic techniques permit 
researchers to sequence genomes, visualize gene expression, and modify 
genes in the nervous system. With new imaging methodologies, researchers 
can monitor neuronal activity electrically, optically, and chemically within single 
cells and in the living brain. Brain-computer interfaces show great promise in 
restoring function in nervous system injuries and disorders.
Together with traditional funding agencies, new government-backed and non￾profit neuroscience initiatives are developing innovative tools and techniques to

Cultured Slices, Cells, and Organoids
Cultured mammalian brain slices and cells are providing insights into neural 
function. Brain slices can be maintained in culture for hours to days. Neuronal and 
glial cells can be isolated from brain tissue or grown from embryonic stem (ES) 
cells and studied in culture for weeks to months.
Cultured slices and cells are accessible for electrophysiology, drug testing, and 
genetic studies. They’re efficient and economical and lessen the need to use as 
many laboratory animals in experimental testing.
One culture technique is to transform adult somatic cells to induced pluripotent 
stem (iPS) cells. iPS cells can then be differentiated to neurons and glial cells in 
culture. iPS cells can be generated from patients with genetically based or idio￾pathic disorders to study isolated, generated tissue that may be affected in or 
underlie these disorders.
Differentiated iPS cells can be investigated using electrophysiology, microscopy, 
and neurogenetics. They can be used to test pharmacological and genetic thera￾pies and as a cell populations for transplantation, such as replacing dopaminergic 
neurons in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
Progress has been made in constructing tissues that can restore organ function. 
Cultures of neural cell aggregates are called neural organoids. They’re being used to 
investigate brain development, disease progression, and drug effects. Neural 
organoids may provide experimental preparations for modeling brain disorders, 
discovering new drugs and gene therapies, and as surrogate brain tissues for 
transplantation.
Fluorescence, Confocal, and 
Two-Photon Microscopy
To understand the structure of the nervous system and how it works, being able 
to see it is valuable. Here are a few techniques that neurobiologists use: 
» Fluorescence microscopy: This is used to image structures in fixed or live 
tissues or cells, and intact animals. It works by using light to excite either an 
artificial fluorescent dye put into the cells or by manipulating the cell to 
synthesize a fluorescent reporter protein.CHAPTER 20 Ten Technologies Revolutionizing Brain Science 373
» Single photon confocal imaging: Confocal imaging increases contrast and 
resolution by using a laser to excite fluorescent dyes across one narrow depth 
level of tissue at a time. A series of two-dimensional images can be assembled 
into three-dimensional images. Using different fluorescent probes that emit at 
different wavelengths, researchers can measure several signals concurrently.
» Two-photon microscopy: This technique uses laser light in the infrared range 
so that two photons are simultaneously absorbed by the reporter. The 
reporter then fluoresces as though it had absorbed a single higher-energy 
photon. It has better spatial resolution and less photodamage of the tissue. 
Spatial resolution can be improved in super-resolution microscopy by 
changing the timing, angle, and patterns of the lasers.
These techniques can image and resolve single synapses. Other applications 
include imaging calcium signals, membrane potentials, neurotransmitter levels, 
or neuronal activity levels in vivo. In photo-pharmacology, chemicals such as glu￾tamate are released from an inactive form by the fluorescent light.
Advances in Electrical Recordings
Extracellular electrodes can be used for single or multiple unit recordings, whole 
nerve recordings, and field potentials. Recordings reveal the firing patterns of 
neural responses during behavior or in response to stimuli. Extracellular record￾ings can be very stable, lasting for days or months.
Intracellular recordings using sharp or patch electrodes study inputs to and 
behavior of single neurons (refer to Chapter 4): 
» A sharp electrode is a glass micropipette with a very small tip, enclosing a wire 
and conductive salt solution. The electrode is inserted inside the neuron, and 
changes in the membrane potential and currents can be monitored for 
several hours.
» A patch electrode has a larger tip that is placed against the cell membrane, 
where a seal is made by suction. The larger tips of patch pipettes make 
injecting current, dyes, or protein modulators into cells more practical.
Patch pipette recording has revolutionized the understanding of single 
neuron electrical properties and activities. It can provide information on how 
pharmaceuticals, DNA-based alterations, or experimenter-induced activity 
patterns can affect specific neuronal activities or channels.374 PART 4 The Part of Tens
Neurogenetics
Neurogenetics is a field of neurobiology that focuses on understanding the contri￾bution of genetics to the function and dysfunction of the nervous system. Here we 
describe neurogenetic techniques for genome sequencing and measuring gene 
expression (refer to Chapter 2).
Genome sequencing
The global Human Genome Project was a breakthrough that used first generation 
sequencing. Today next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have increased 
efficiencies with more applications. Techniques for DNA sequencing (DNA-Seq) 
are specific to the genome while RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is for sequencing 
RNAs, gene expression, and the transcriptome.
Only a small percentage of genomic DNA encodes RNAs and proteins, called 
exomes. Exosomes are typically the regions of DNA responsible for genetic disor￾ders. Whole exome sequencing is rapid and affordable.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful technique for identifying 
gene variations that contribute to susceptibility to developing neurological 
diseases and mental disorders. GWAS has identified risk genes in Alzheimer’s, 
Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum 
disorder, depression, and schizophrenia.
Gene expression
Epigenetics involves modification of DNA and histones (without changing the DNA 
sequences) that contribute to control of gene expression. Researchers are investi￾gating the disruption of epigenetic regulators and modifications as contributors to 
neurological diseases and mental disorders.
Traditional techniques to measure gene expression involve northern blots, quan￾titative PCR, in situ hybridization, and microarrays (gene chips). Today, variations 
of RNA-Seq are being used to measure gene expression in populations of cells and 
in individual neurons or glial cells.CHAPTER 20 Ten Technologies Revolutionizing Brain Science 375
Genetic Manipulation of Neural Cells
Genetically manipulated animals have provided models to study neurodevelop￾mental, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Recent gene editing technologies 
makes the generation of animal models and manipulation of genes more specific 
and accessible.
In knock-out animals, a gene or its part is deleted in the genome to diminish its 
protein expression. Conditional knock-outs use promotors that provide control of 
the timing and location of the genetic changes. Genetic knock-ins substitute a 
genetic abnormality for a normal gene.
Genetic abnormalities can potentially be treated using gene therapies. DNA and 
RNA viruses are engineered with sequences that knock out defective host genes or 
insert new genes into the host to correct for the genetic abnormality.
The microbial defense system CRISPR/Cas9 is a gene-editing technology. It has 
been used for manipulation of genes, to engineer animal models of neurological 
disorders, to test gene therapies, and to study large-scale functional genomics in 
neural cells. Gene editing holds great promise for genetic treatments of neuro￾logical and mental disorders.
Brain Imaging: Optical, Magnetic, 
and Electrical
Until the 1970s, the only widely used techniques to study activity or structure in 
the intact brain were single-cell recordings, electroencephalography (EEG) and 
X-rays/CT scans.
Today more powerful techniques monitor brain structure and function, including 
the following:
» Optical recording: Optical reporting techniques use fluorescent reporter 
dyes that change their fluorescence in response to voltage or ion concentra￾tions changes in neurons. These dyes allow neurobiologists to record neural 
activity using a microscope-linked camera from individual or groups of cells 
in vivo or in tissue slices.
» Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Certain molecules in the body, when 
placed in a strong magnetic field, align along the field. Sending radio waves 
into the tissue tilt the alignment. When the radio waves are turned off, the 376 PART 4 The Part of Tens
atoms then return to the original (magnetically induced) alignment. As they 
return, they emit an electrical signal that’s captured by a receiver, processed 
by a computer, and converted into an image of the brain with millimeter 
resolution.
» Functional MRI (fMRI): This technique uses changes in the amount of 
hemoglobin in a given brain area (blood flow) or its amount of oxygenation 
(blood oxygen level dependent) to give an index of brain activity in a particular 
area, with centimeter resolution.
» Magnetic encephalography (MEG): MEG measures the small magnetic 
fields associated with current flow in the brain. It has moderately high spatial 
resolution, approaching fMRI, with simultaneously high temporal resolution 
like EEG.
Electrical Brain Stimulation
An advantage of using electrical stimulation to modify human brain activity is it 
reduces the side effects that can occur with pharmacological treatments. It’s also 
rapid, easily and immediately modifiable, and reversible. Here are some of the 
recent techniques used in brain stimulation.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) involves a short-duration high mag￾netic field pulse via a coil outside the head over the brain area to be stimulated. 
This produces relatively localized, transient electrical currents that stimulate or 
disrupt neural activity. TMS has been used to treat depression, posttraumatic 
stress disorder, epilepsy, and migraines, by stimulating specific brain areas (refer 
to Chapters 4 and 18).
Transcranial direct current stimulation
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) involves passing a small direct 
current between two electrodes on the scalp. Brain regions near the anode gener￾ally appear to be stimulated, whereas areas near the cathode may be inhibited. 
Small electrical currents may increase neural spontaneous activity or enhance 
signal-to-noise ratios.CHAPTER 20 Ten Technologies Revolutionizing Brain Science 377
Long-lasting improvements in learning or cognitive performance from tDCS have 
been reported — from improving math performance to alleviating symptoms in 
schizophrenia to enhancing cognitive function in the elderly. tDCS may prove to 
be a valuable tool for modulation of brain activity.
Deep brain stimulation
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves implanting tiny electrodes within particu￾lar brain regions to deliver electrical currents to alter brain activity (refer to 
Chapter 12). Clinicians have successfully used DBS to treat Parkinson’s disease by 
stimulating areas to compensate for the dopamine deficit. Clinicians have also 
used DBS to treat individuals with chronic pain, treatment resistant depression or 
epilepsy (see the section “Brains Interfaced with Computers” later in this chapter).
Optogenetics
Electricity can stimulate networks of neurons but isn’t ideal for precise control of 
specific neural activity within the circuit. Optogenetics is used to precisely control 
neuronal activity by activating light-sensitive channels that are artificially 
expressed in the membranes of particular neurons. Researchers have cloned these 
channels from microbes that evolved them to control specific behaviors, such as 
moving toward light. The channel genes are introduced into and expressed in the 
neurons. Applying a light stimulus to the brain area then activates or inhibits only 
those neurons that express the microbial light channels. The neuronal response to 
the light depends on the optogenetic channel’s properties.
Optogenetics allows scientists to monitor and modulate activity of individual neu￾rons in freely moving animals. Development of cell-specific promoters and 
micro-optical stimulators is ongoing to target specific neurons. Optogenetics has 
the potential to advance the basic understanding of neural circuit operation and 
offer insights into neurological dysfunctions.
Microelectrode Arrays
Scientists developed microelectrode arrays (also called multielectrode arrays) to 
explore neural circuit operation and stimulate small numbers of neurons to con￾trol specific circuits.378 PART 4 The Part of Tens
Microelectrode arrays contain from tens to thousands of extracellular microelec￾trodes that can measure or stimulate neuronal activity in live cells, tissue slices, 
animals, or people. Implantable microelectrode arrays are placed in vivo; non￾implantable microelectrode arrays are used in vitro.
Microelectrode arrays have been used to measure activity in cell cultures, brain 
slices, and intact animal retinas. Recent adaptations in electrodes have facilitated 
in vivo recordings from rodent cortical and subcortical regions.
Microelectrode arrays have been implanted in humans for motor and sensory 
neuroprostheses with promising results (see the next section). Future develop￾ments are toward bigger, faster, more powerful, and less energy-consumptive 
computing chips. These may permit the development of even more complex and 
competent prosthetic devices.
Brains Interfaced with Computers
The goal of neuroprosthetics is the modulation or replacement of components of 
the nervous system that are disrupted in neurological injury or disorders. It 
involves the use of neural interface systems (NISs). NISs are typically composed of 
an implanted microelectrode array or multiple electrodes, an input or output 
device, a mapping or decoding algorithm, and sensory feedback.
The most successful sensory neuroprosthesis is the cochlear implant hearing aid 
(refer to Chapter 14). Neural hearing loss can occur following damage to cochlear 
auditory hair cells. Conductive loss and neural loss can be substantially alleviated 
by cochlear implants, which are linear stimulation arrays surgically threaded into 
the cochlear spiral with electrodes that directly stimulate the auditory nerves.
Here are some exciting developments:
» Visual neuroprosthesis: A microelectrode array is implanted within the 
retina. Special glasses that detect and transmit information about images are 
connected to a computer that sends signals to the array to activate retinal 
neurons. Higher density multiple microelectrode arrays are being developed 
to provide more detailed images.
» Motor neuroprosthesis: These strategies attempt to restore motor function 
by electrical stimulation of neural components involved in the generation of 
movement following injury, stroke, or neurodegeneration. Techniques include 
functional electrical stimulation (FES), spinal cord stimulation (SES), and brain 
computer interface (BCI). In 2018, studies combining SES with intensive CHAPTER 20 Ten Technologies Revolutionizing Brain Science 379
rehabilitation enabled independent overground walking in six subjects with 
spinal cord injuries.
» BCI: BCI involves recording activity in the motor cortex and using that pattern 
to control movement to bypass injury to the spinal cord. In studies with 
subjects with spinal cord injuries, recorded movement control activity 
patterns were delivered to the spinal cord segments to control motor output 
and led to restoration of limb movements.
In a BrainGate2 clinical trial, participants with tetraplegia had microelectrode 
arrays implanted in their motor cortex. Participants used an intracortical BCI 
to control a computer to communicate with others via email and for web 
browsing. Successful speech neuroprosthesis development is also underway. 
Patients wear a high-density electrode array to capture and record neural 
activity from the speech motor cortex.
» Implantable DBS microelectrodes with closed-loop sensing systems for 
longer-term use: Intracranial electrodes record brain activity in a specific 
region and provide information back to a computer chip that controls the 
output to stimulating electrodes. One example is the detection of an immi￾nent epileptic seizure by recording electrodes by a chip, which would then 
stimulate inhibitory neurons to stop the seizure.Index 381

Frank Amthor is an Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the University of 
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). He obtained his undergraduate degree in bioelec￾tronic engineering from Cornell University and his PhD in biomedical engineering 
from Duke University. Frank was an NIH-supported researcher for more than 20 
years. He was also supported by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, the Sloan Foun￾dation, and the Eyesight Foundation. His research is focused on retinal and central 
visual processing and neural prostheses. He has published more than 
100 journal articles, book chapters, and conference abstracts.
Frank’s career has been devoted to understanding complex neural computations 
in retinal ganglion cells, the first locus in the visual system of highly specific and 
nonlinear analyses such as motion and directional selectivity. The investigative 
techniques Frank has used include virtually the entire suite of single-cell neuro￾physiological techniques, including single-cell extracellular recording, sharp 
electrode intracellular recording and staining, patch clamp recording, optical 
imaging with both calcium and potentiometric dyes, dual electrode recording, 
and, most recently, microelectrode array recording.
Frank has taught extensively on the nervous system, from genetics and ion 
channels, to neural function, to gross anatomy, in courses such as Behavioral 
Neuroscience, Cognitive Neuroscience, Perception, Sensory Information Processing, 
Cognitive Psychology, and Vision Science. He has also written Neuroscience For 
Dummies (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Anne Theibert is a Professor in the Neurobiology Department in the University of 
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Heersink School of Medicine. She completed her 
PhD in biological chemistry and postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience, both at 
Johns Hopkins University. After joining the faculty at UAB, Anne ran a govern￾ment and foundation-funded research program for 18 years. As a research scien￾tist she mentored graduate and medical students and taught in graduate and 
medical school courses.
Anne’s training and research expertise is in cellular and molecular neurobiology. 
Her laboratory research used genetic, molecular biology, and biochemical 
techniques, coupled with cell and slice culture to investigate early neuronal and
