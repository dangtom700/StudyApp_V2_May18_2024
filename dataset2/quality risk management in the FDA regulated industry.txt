Since the publication of the first edition of this book in 2012, the 
emphasis on risk-based processes has grown exponentially across 
all sectors, and risk management is now considered as significant 
as quality management. ISO 9001, the fundamental international quality 
management system (QMS) standard, was recently revised under the new 
version, ISO 9001:2015 (International Organization for Standardization 
2015), and it now requires that top management promote the use of risk￾based thinking.
Another example of the greater emphasis on risk management is the 
international standard ISO 13485:2016, which specifies the requirements for 
a QMS specific to the medical device industry. The new version published 
in March 2016 (International Organization for Standardization 2016) shows 
a greater emphasis on risk management and risk-based decision-making. 
A third example is the U.S. FDA Food Safety Modernization Act 
(FSMA), the most important reform of U.S. food safety laws in more than 
70 years. It was signed into law by President Obama on January 4, 2011. It 
aims to ensure that the U.S. food supply is safe by shifting the focus from 
responding to contamination to preventing it. In other words, it is a risk￾based food safety prevention system.
The purpose of this third edition of this book is to offer an updated view 
of the risk management field as it applies to FDA-regulated products. Three 
key guidelines have been recently updated [ICH Q9(R1), ISO 14971:2019, 
and ISO 22000:2018], and they are discussed in this new edition. This book 
will assist medical and food product manufacturers with the integration 
of a risk management system or risk management principles and activities 
into their existing QMS by providing practical explanations and examples. 
The appropriate use of quality risk management can facilitate compliance 
with regulatory requirements such as good manufacturing practice or good 
laboratory practice.
Preface to the 
Third EditionThe first chapter of the book presents the historical background of the 
risk-based concepts and how the initial safety-only focus moved to a wider 
scenario with the consideration of several other elements.
The second chapter presents what is currently being done in the 
different areas regulated by the FDA. It describes the updated harmonization 
documents and international standards developed for different types of 
products such as medical devices, food, and drugs. This chapter now includes 
the risk requirement of the newest version of ISO 14971:2019 for medical 
devices, the updated ICH guidance for industry Q9(R1) published in May 
2023, and the new version of ISO 22000:2018 with its updated requirements 
for food safety management systems. A new section was included to discuss 
the latest initiative implemented by the FDA to use risk management plans 
to mitigate the potential of drug shortages.
The third chapter describes the main principles of the quality risk 
management field, emphasizing the sound scientific basis of the quality risk 
management process and its close relationship with quality system elements.
The fourth chapter details the quality risk management process, defin￾ing responsibilities and then, sequentially, the whole process, starting with 
risk assessment, continuing with risk control and risk communication, and 
ending with a review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the risk process. 
The fifth chapter describes the integration between risk management 
and quality management, including detailed examples of such integra￾tion. It also included a section covering pre- and post-market risk for 
medical products.
The sixth chapter presents a collection of the methodologies and 
tools more widely used during risk management processes. Each tool is 
explained in great detail, including real examples from the FDA-regulated 
industry. These examples make this one of the most valuable sections of this 
book, along with the very detailed explanation and examples of practical 
applications that can be found in Chapter 7, including topics such as error 
risk reduction, benefit–risk determination, and data integrity issues.
The eighth chapter discusses some of the most common pitfalls and 
misunderstandings regarding risk management, specifically those related 
to the use of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) as the only element 
of risk management programs. 
Finally, there are five appendices, including a very detailed risk 
management case study (Appendix B) and an example of a quality risk 
management procedure (Appendix D).

Introduction to Quality 
Risk Management
WHAT IS QUALITY
RISK MANAGEMENT?
Organizations of all types and sizes face internal and external factors and 
influences that create uncertainty about whether and when they will achieve 
their objectives. The effect this uncertainty has on an organization’s objec￾tives is called “risk.”
All activities of an organization involve risk. Organizations manage 
risk by identifying it, analyzing it, and then evaluating whether the risk 
should be modified by risk treatment to satisfy their risk criteria. Through￾out this process, they communicate and consult with stakeholders, and 
monitor and review the risk and the controls in place to modify the risk in 
order to ensure that no further risk treatment is required. All organizations 
manage risk to some degree, and the final goal is to integrate the process 
for managing risk into the organization’s overall governance, strategy and 
planning, management, reporting processes, policies, values, and culture.
Risk management can be applied to an entire organization, throughout 
its many areas and levels, at any time, as well as to specific functions, 
projects, and activities. It’s important to understand that risk management 
is not a one-time task. It is a continuous, never-ending process that should 
focus on multiple organizational aspects. All of those considerations tie 
into one comprehensive risk management program. Although the practice 
of risk management has been developed over time and within many sectors 
in order to meet diverse needs, the adoption of consistent processes within 
a comprehensive framework can help to ensure that risk is managed effec￾tively, efficiently, and coherently across an organization. 
Each specific sector or application of risk management brings with 
it individual needs, audiences, perceptions, and criteria. When properly 
12  Chapter One
implemented and maintained, the management of risk enables an 
organization to:
• Foster proactive management
• Improve controls and operational effectiveness and efficiency
• Be aware of the need to identify and treat risk throughout 
the organization
• Improve the identification of opportunities and threats
• Comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
• Improve mandatory and voluntary reporting
• Improve governance and stakeholder confidence and trust
• Establish a reliable basis for decision-making and planning
• Effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment
• Improve loss prevention and minimize losses
• Improve organizational learning and flexibility
It is impossible to design and develop a medical product that is risk free. 
The inherently risky nature of medical products, especially those used 
to treat critical conditions or those that come into contact with critical 
systems (in the case of medical devices), means that manufacturers must 
thoroughly analyze their products’ risks against many factors. Prior to 
analyzing risks, manufacturers should make a risk management plan to 
implement the risk management process throughout the life cycle of their 
medical products. This process will help manufacturers identify potential 
hazards and foreseeable misuse, and estimate the risks for each hazard to 
better control and mitigate them. 
Manufacturers must use risk management to actually reduce these 
risks and hazards, making their products safer for users and patients. 
The current management practices and processes of many organizations 
include components of risk management, and many organizations have 
already adopted a formal risk management process for particular types of 
risk or circumstances. The terms “risk management” and “managing risk” 
are commonly used. In general terms, risk management refers to the archi￾tecture (principles, framework, and process) for managing risks effectively, 
while managing risk refers to applying that architecture to particular risks 
(International Organization for Standardization 2018b). Introduction to Quality Risk Management  3
Risk management principles are effectively utilized in many areas 
of business and government, including finance, insurance, occupational 
safety, public health, and pharmacovigilance, and by agencies regulating 
these industries. Although there are examples of the use of quality risk 
management in the biopharmaceutical industry today, they are limited and 
do not represent the full contribution that risk management has to offer. 
In addition, the importance of quality systems has been recognized in 
the pharmaceutical industry, and it is becoming evident that quality risk 
management is a valuable component of an effective quality system.
It is commonly understood that risk is defined as the combination of the 
probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. However, 
achieving a shared understanding of the application of risk management 
among diverse stakeholders is difficult because each stakeholder might 
perceive different potential harms, place a different probability on each 
harm occurring, and attribute different severities to each harm. In relation 
to pharmaceuticals, although there are a variety of stakeholders, including 
patients and medical practitioners as well as government and industry, 
the protection of the patient by managing the risk to quality should be 
considered of prime importance.
In the case of medical devices, manufacturers are generally required 
to have a quality management system as well as processes for addressing 
device-related risks. These processes for managing risk can evolve into a 
stand-alone management system, or manufacturers may choose to maintain 
these two management systems separately, but it may be advantageous to 
integrate them, as it could reduce costs, eliminate redundancies, and lead to 
a more effective management system.
ISO 14971 was developed to assist medical device manufacturers with 
the integration of a risk management system or risk management principles 
and activities into their existing quality management system by providing 
practical explanations and examples.
The scope of the medical device manufacturer’s quality management 
system will define the applicability and extent of implementing risk man￾agement principles and activities.
Processes required by the quality management system and performed 
by suppliers to the manufacturer are the responsibility of the manu￾facturer. Risk management activities relating to any process within the 
quality management system are also ultimately the responsibility of the 
manufacturer.
An effective quality management system is essential for ensuring 
the safety and performance of medical devices. A well-defined quality 
management system includes safety considerations in specific areas. Given 
the importance of safety, it is useful to identify some key activities that 4  Chapter One
specifically address safety issues and ensure appropriate input and feedback 
from these activities into the quality management system. The degree to 
which safety considerations are addressed should be commensurate with 
the degree of the risk and the nature of the device. Some devices present 
relatively low risk or have well-understood risks with established methods 
of risk control.
Risk management principles should be applied throughout the life 
cycle of medical devices and used to identify and address safety issues. In 
general, risk management can be characterized by phases of activities. The 
first phase can be the determination of levels of risk that would be accept￾able in the device. Manufacturers should have a procedure or policy to 
determine risk acceptability criteria. These risk acceptability criteria may 
come from an analysis of the manufacturer’s own experience with similar 
medical devices or research on what appear to be currently accepted risk 
levels by regulators, users, or patients, given the benefits derived from 
diagnosis or treatment with the device. Risk acceptability criteria generally 
should be reflective of the state of the art in controlling risks.
The second phase can be risk analysis. This phase starts with identi￾fying hazards that may occur due to characteristics or properties of the 
device during normal use or foreseeable misuse. After hazards are 
identified, risks are estimated for each of the identified hazards, using 
available information. In the third phase, the estimated risks are compared 
to the risk acceptability criteria.
This comparison will determine an appropriate level of risk reduction, 
if necessary. This is called risk evaluation. The combination of risk 
analysis and risk evaluation is called risk assessment. The fourth phase 
can comprise risk control and monitoring activities. The manufacturer 
establishes actions (risk control measures) intended to eliminate or 
reduce each risk to meet the previously determined risk acceptability 
criteria. Within the limits of feasibility, one or more risk control measures 
may be incorporated in order to achieve this end. Risk control activities 
may begin as early as design input and continue through the design and 
development process, manufacturing, distribution, installation, and 
servicing, and throughout the medical device life cycle. Some regulatory 
schemes prescribe a fixed hierarchy of risk control measures that should be 
examined in the following order:
1. Inherent safety by design
2. Protective measures in the device or its manufacture
3. Information for safety, such as warningsIntroduction to Quality Risk Management  5
Throughout the life cycle of the device, the manufacturer monitors 
whether the risks continue to remain acceptable and whether any new 
hazards or risks are discovered. Information typically obtained from the 
quality management system—for example, production, complaints, cus￾tomer feedback—should be used as part of this monitoring. If, at any time, 
a risk is determined to be unacceptable, the existing risk analysis should 
be reexamined and appropriate action should be taken to meet the risk 
acceptability criteria. If a new hazard is identified, the four phases of risk 
management should be performed. These activities can be performed 
within the framework of the quality management system.
TASTE OF RASPBERRIES, 
TASTE OF DEATH: THE 1937 ELIXIR 
SULFANILAMIDE INCIDENT
Following is a reproduction of an article by FDA’s Carol Ballentine pub￾lished in the June 1981 issue of the now-defunct FDA Consumer magazine 
related to the 1937 Sulfanilamide disaster. 
By the 1930s it was widely recognized that the Food and Drugs 
Act of 1906 was obsolete, but bitter disagreement arose as to 
what should replace it. By 1937 most of the arguments had been 
resolved but Congressional action was stalled. Then came a 
shocking development—the deaths of more than 100 people after 
using a drug that was clearly unsafe. The incident hastened final 
enactment in 1938 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 
the statute that today remains the basis for FDA regulation of 
these products.
“Nobody but Almighty God and I can know what I have been 
through these past few days. I have been familiar with death in the 
years since I received my M.D. from Tulane University School of 
Medicine with the rest of my class of 1911. Covington County has 
been my home. I have practiced here for years. Any doctor who 
has practiced more than a quarter of a century has seen his share 
of death.
But to realize that six human beings, all of them my patients, 
one of them my best friend, are dead because they took medicine 
that I prescribed for them innocently, and to realize that that 
medicine which I had used for years in such cases suddenly had 
become a deadly poison in its newest and most modern form, 
as recommended by a great and reputable pharmaceutical firm 6  Chapter One
in Tennessee: well, that realization has given me such days and 
nights of mental and spiritual agony as I did not believe a human 
being could undergo and survive. I have known hours when death 
for me would be a welcome relief from this agony.” (Letter by Dr. 
A.S. Calhoun, October 22, 1937)
The medicine that killed Dr. Calhoun’s patients was Elixir 
Sulfanilamide. During September and October 1937, this drug 
was responsible for the deaths of more than 100 people in 15 
states, as far east as Virginia and as far west as California. The 
drug and the deaths led to the passage of the 1938 Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act, which increased FDA’s authority to regulate drugs.
Sulfanilamide, a drug used to treat streptococcal infections, 
had been shown to have dramatic curative effects and had been 
used safely for some time in tablet and powder form. In June 
1937, however, a salesman for the S. E. Massengill Co., in Bristol, 
Tenn., reported a demand in the southern states for the drug in 
liquid form. The company’s chief chemist and pharmacist, Harold 
Cole Watkins, experimented and found that sulfanilamide would 
dissolve in diethylene glycol. The company control lab tested 
the mixture for flavor, appearance, and fragrance and found it 
satisfactory. Immediately, the company compounded a quantity of 
the elixir and sent shipments—633 of them—all over the country.
The new formulation had not been tested for toxicity. At the 
time the food and drugs law did not require that safety studies 
be done on new drugs. Selling toxic drugs was, undoubtedly, bad 
for business and could damage a firm’s reputation, but it was 
not illegal.
Because no pharmacological studies had been done on the 
new sulfanilamide preparation, Watkins failed to note one charac￾teristic of the solution. Diethylene glycol, a chemical normally 
used as antifreeze, is a deadly poison. The first shipments were 
sent out in early September. On October 11, the American 
Medical Association (AMA) received reports from physicians 
in Tulsa, Okla., that an unfamiliar sulfanilamide compound was 
responsible for a number of deaths. The AMA asked for samples 
of the drug and then wired the Massengill Co., requesting the 
composition of the compound. The AMA laboratory isolated 
diethylene glycol as the toxic ingredient and immediately issued a 
warning, through newspapers and radio, that Elixir Sulfanilamide 
was toxic and deadly.Introduction to Quality Risk Management  7
A New York physician learned of the deaths on October 14 
and promptly notified Food and Drug Administration head￾quarters. An inspector from the agency’s Kansas City station 
confirmed that eight children and one adult had died and that 
all had taken a product labeled “Elixir Sulfanilamide, the S. E. 
Massengill Co., Manufacturing Pharmacists, Bristol, Tenn.–Va.”
Inspectors were immediately dispatched to the firm’s head￾quarters in Bristol and to branch offices in Kansas City, New 
York, and San Francisco. They found that the firm had already 
learned of the poisonous effects of the liquid sulfanilamide and 
had sent telegrams to more than 1,000 salesmen, druggists, and 
doctors. However, the telegrams merely requested the return of 
the product and failed to indicate the urgency of the situation or 
say the drug was lethal. At FDA’s insistence, the firm sent out a 
second wave of messages, worded more strongly: “Imperative you 
take up immediately all elixir sulfanilamide dispensed. Product 
may be dangerous to life. Return all stocks, our expense.”
FDA then set out to make sure all the drug was retrieved. 
Practically the entire field force of 239 FDA inspectors and 
chemists was assigned to the task. State and local health officials 
joined the search. Newspapers and radio stations continued to issue 
warnings. The staff began by checking the company’s shipping 
records and the distribution lists in the four distributing houses 
and in a number of wholesale and retail drugstores. Thousands of 
order slips were examined one by one. In one establishment alone, 
20,000 sales slips were checked.
FDA employees tracked down the firm’s 200 salesmen and 
questioned them about the dispersion of shipments and physi￾cian samples. Finding the salesmen was the first problem. In 
one typical case, a salesman was reported to be in a hotel in 
Washington, D.C. He was not there, but forwarding addresses 
had been left for him in Jackson, Mich., and in Baltimore. These 
turned out to be for another man with the same name. Four days 
of searching finally found the man in University Park, Md. Once 
the salesmen were found, there was still the problem of getting 
the distribution information. One man in Texas, for instance, 
revealed the necessary information only after being jailed by 
state authorities.
In many cases, locating the purchasers of the elixir required 
some real detective work. In some drugstores, the elixir had been 
sold without prescriptions to purchasers whose names the druggist 8  Chapter One
didn’t know. In other cases, doctors had incomplete records—or 
none at all—of the names and addresses of patients for whom they 
had prescribed. In East St. Louis, Ill., for instance, 49 prescrip￾tions were filled and the only identification on some were 
such notations as “Betty Jane, 9 months old,” or “Mrs. Jackson 
(no address).”
Even when the purchaser was finally located, the inspectors 
frequently needed to do some ingenious questioning to deter￾mine what happened to the purchased elixir. One East St. Louis
woman told an inspector she had destroyed the drug. The inspector 
persisted in his questions, however. What did she mean “destroy”? 
Had she poured it down the sink? Had she buried it? No, the 
woman said, she had thrown the bottle out the window into an 
alley. The inspector found the bottle still unbroken, still contain￾ing enough elixir to kill any child intrigued enough to swallow its 
sweet, raspberry-flavored contents.
Many doctors and pharmacists did everything in their power 
to recover the elixir. One physician postponed his wedding to help 
an FDA chemist search for a three-year-old boy whose family had 
moved into mountain country after obtaining a prescription.
Other physicians apparently were reluctant to admit that 
they had prescribed the drug, perhaps fearing they would be held 
accountable for its consequences. One inspector, checking out 
a Georgia drugstore, was told that a shipment of one gallon of 
elixir had been returned to the manufacturer after only 6 ounces 
had been dispensed. The patient who had taken the 6 ounces had 
suffered no ill effects, the druggist reported, and the inspector 
confirmed that this was true. But the inspector assigned to Bristol 
reported that 12 ounces was actually missing from the returned 
gallon, so the inspector in Georgia did some more questioning 
around town and tuned his ears to the local gossip. He learned that 
two other people had also bought the elixir. Both had died.
Similarly, a South Carolina doctor told an inspector that he 
had dispensed the medicine to only five people and none had 
died. But when the inspector began asking questions around town, 
someone told him of the death of a lumber mill employee. The 
inspector recognized the symptoms as those characteristic of 
Elixir Sulfanilamide poisoning. Through the mill superintendent, 
he located the employee’s sister. Yes, she said, her brother had 
gone to the doctor and had been given some red medicine before 
he died. She told the inspector that, in accordance with custom, 
all medicines and sickroom utensils had been placed on the grave, Introduction to Quality Risk Management  9
about one and a half miles back in the fields. Accompanied by 
family and friends, the dead man’s sister and the inspector walked 
to the wooded knoll. On the single mound of fresh earth were 
several bottles, dishes, spoons, and a 4-ounce bottle containing 
about 1 ounce of Elixir of Sulfanilamide. It bore the weathered 
but legible prescription label of the doctor. In fact, the inspector 
learned, four of the doctor’s patients had died after taking 
the elixir.
Victims of Elixir Sulfanilamide poisoning—many of them 
children being treated for sore throats—were ill about 7 to 21 days. 
All exhibited similar symptoms, characteristic of kidney failure: 
stoppage of urine, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, 
stupor, and convulsions. They suffered intense and unrelenting 
pain. At the time there was no known antidote or treatment for 
diethylene glycol poisoning.
In a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a woman 
described the death of her child:
“The first time I ever had occasion to call in a doctor for 
[Joan] and she was given Elixir of Sulfanilamide. All that is left 
to us is the caring for her little grave. Even the memory of her is 
mixed with sorrow for we can see her little body tossing to and 
fro and hear that little voice screaming with pain and it seems as 
though it would drive me insane…. It is my plea that you will take 
steps to prevent such sales of drugs that will take little lives and 
leave such suffering behind and such a bleak outlook on the future 
as I have tonight.”
A few simple tests on experimental animals would have 
demonstrated the lethal properties of the elixir. Even a review 
of the current existing scientific literature would have shown 
that other studies—such as those reported in several medical 
journals—had indicated that diethylene glycol was toxic and 
could cause kidney damage or failure. But in 1937 the law did not 
prohibit the sale of dangerous, untested, or poisonous drugs. Dr. 
Samuel Evans Massengill, the firm’s owner, said: “My chemists 
and I deeply regret the fatal results, but there was no error in the 
manufacture of the product. We have been supplying a legitimate 
professional demand and not once could have foreseen the 
unlooked-for results. I do not feel that there was any responsibility 
on our part.” The firm’s chemist apparently did not share this 
feeling; Harold Watkins committed suicide after learning of the 
effects of his latest concoction.10  Chapter One
Through the dogged persistence of federal, state, and local 
health agencies and the effects of the AMA and the news media, 
most of the elixir was recovered. Of 240 gallons manufactured and 
distributed, 234 gallons and 1 pint were retrieved; the remainder 
was consumed and caused the deaths of the victims.
Twenty-five seizures were made under federal law. The charge 
was misbranding. “Elixir,” FDA said, implied the product was 
an alcoholic solution, whereas it was, in fact, a diethylene glycol 
solution and contained no alcohol. If the product had been called 
a “solution” instead of an “elixir,” no charge of violating the law 
could have been made. FDA would have had no legal authority to 
ensure the recovery of the drug, and many more people probably 
would have died.
FDA Commissioner Walter Campbell, who was then pressing 
for better federal regulation of drugs, pointed out how the inade￾quacy of the law had contributed to the disaster. “It is unfortunate 
that under the terms of our present inadequate Federal law, the 
Food and Drug Administration is obliged to proceed against 
this product on a technical and trivial charge of misbranding…. 
[The Elixir Sulfanilamide incident] emphasizes how essential it 
is to public welfare that the distribution of highly potent drugs 
should be controlled by an adequate Federal Food and Drug law. 
… We should not lose sight of the fact that we had many deaths 
and cases of blindness resulting from the use of another new drug, 
dinitrophenol, which was recklessly placed upon the market some 
years ago. Deaths and blindness from this [drug] are continuing 
today. We also should remember the deaths resulting from damage 
to the liver that have occurred from cinchophen poisoning, a drug 
often recommended in such painful conditions as rheumatism. 
We also have unfortunate poisoning, acute and chronic, resulting 
from thyroid and radium preparations improperly administered to 
the public.
“These unfortunate occurrences may be expected to continue 
because new and relatively untried drug preparations are being 
manufactured almost daily at the whim of the individual manu￾facturer, and the damage to public health cannot accurately be 
estimated. The only remedy for such a situation is the enactment 
by Congress of an adequate and comprehensive national Food and 
Drugs Act which will require that all medicines placed upon the 
market shall be safe to use under the directions for use….”
As it turned out, the elixir experience did more than hasten 
enactment of the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Introduction to Quality Risk Management  11
The New Drug section, added to prevent such tragedies, gave 
the United States a new system of drug control, which provided 
superior protection while stimulating medical research and prog￾ress. And 25 years later, it saved the nation from an even greater 
drug tragedy—a thalidomide disaster—like that in Germany and 
England. Here again, history repeated itself. A pending bill, the 
Drug Amendments of 1962, was finally enacted.
SEVENTY YEARS LATER
At the end of September 2006, several hospitals in Panama City (Panama) 
were filling up with patients with contradictory symptoms. The symptoms 
seemed to match with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but these patients were 
also losing their ability to urinate, a symptom not related to Guillain￾Barré. The death rate of this mysterious illness was nearly 50 percent when 
hospital management decided to isolate all the patients with the illness in 
a large room so doctors could compare notes and theories. Soon, patients 
from other parts of the country started to arrive at hospitals. Doctors 
had no idea what was happening: the mysterious illness was attacking 
elderly citizens with hypertension and diabetes history. About half were 
receiving a blood pressure medicine, and many did not remember clearly 
if they had been taking other drugs. Suspecting something wrong with the 
hypertension drug, the medicine was removed from the pharmacies while 
the U.S. FDA conducted laboratory analyses, revealing that the blood 
pressure drug was safe. 
Most of the patients taking the blood pressure medicine developed a 
cough (a common side effect), and they were prescribed an expectorant. 
Immediately, biological samples and the syrup were sent to the United 
States for analysis. When urine analyses for a series of metals, pesticides, 
or their metabolites resulted negative, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 
scientists recalled previous incidents in Nigeria and Haiti. The CDC 
analysis revealed that the samples contained approximately 8 percent v/v 
diethylene glycol (DEG). Later, raw glycerin was analyzed and results 
revealed 22.2 percent v/v DEG.
The Panamanian government implemented a nationwide campaign, 
collecting around 6,000 bottles of cough syrup and three other products 
with the tainted glycerin manufactured by Social Security Laboratories. 
The 46 barrels of syrup were bought by Social Security Laboratories 
through a Panamanian middleman, Grupo Comercial Medicom, who 
bought the product from Rasfer Internacional, a Spanish company. In 
fact, Rasfer received the product from CNSC Fortune Way, which in 
turn bought it from the Taixing Glycerine Factory. At the request of the 12  Chapter One
United States, the Chinese FDA investigated the Taixing Glycerine Factory 
and CNSC Fortune Way, but the agency concluded that it was not under 
their jurisdiction because the factory was not certified to make medicine. 
Taixing sold the syrup as “TD glycerin,” wording that neither Chinese 
inspectors nor Spanish medical authorities comprehended. Unfortunately, 
Taixing used “TD” for the Chinese word tidai, meaning “substitute.”
The New York Times reported that Taixing was closed by the Chinese 
government and CNSC Fortune Way was never sanctioned (Bogdanich and 
Hooker 2007). In Spain, Rasfer Internacional declared bankruptcy after the 
lawyer of Medicom filed a lawsuit for $400 million in July 2008. Spanish 
authorities prosecuted the general manager of Rasfer Internacional. Mean￾while, in Panama, the legal representative of Medicom was jailed pending 
trial. Seventeen other persons were also charged in relation to the incident. 
The Panama case caused CDC to set standardized methodology for 
DEG identification, hoping to have a more timely response in future events. 
After that incident, FDA also issued an Industry Guidance document 
“intended to alert pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy compounders, 
repackers, and suppliers to the potential public health hazard of glycerin 
contaminated with DEG and recommended appropriate testing proce￾dures for the use of glycerin.” As of June of 2011, the number of confirmed 
deaths, according to the official Panama government list, had risen to 
219 victims.
In 2022, more than 300 children (mainly younger than 5 years old) in 
Gambia, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan died of acute kidney injury, in deaths 
that were associated with contaminated medicines (over-the-counter cough 
syrups) having high levels of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND 
RISK ASSESSMENT
Risk management is defined in ISO 14971:2019 as “the systematic applica￾tion of management policies, procedures, and practices to the task of 
analyzing, evaluating, controlling, and monitoring risk.” As such, risk man￾agement is an ongoing, continuous, and iterative process.
Risk assessment can be considered as a subset of the risk management 
process; it is the first step in the risk management process, and it involves 
both the analysis and evaluation of risks. The complete risk management 
process, in addition to risk assessment, includes risk control and risk 
monitoring. Chapter 4 details the different elements of the risk manage￾ment process.Introduction to Quality Risk Management  13
RISK-BASED APPROACH
Developing a risk culture is one of the most important tasks a regulated 
firm can do to manage risk. All medical products carry some degree of risk 
(from design and manufacturing errors to use errors), and even the safer, 
over-the-counter medicines and devices are highly regulated. Regulators, 
by definition, are inherently risk averse, and FDA is no exception; however, 
in 2002, it announced a significant new initiative, “Pharmaceutical cGMPs 
for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach,” to enhance and modernize 
the regulation of pharmaceutical manufacturing and product quality—
to bring a twenty-first-century focus to this critical FDA responsibility. 
The initiative was intended to modernize the FDA’s regulation of 
pharmaceutical quality for veterinary and human drugs and select human 
biological products such as vaccines.
As part of this initiative, both the pharmaceutical and the chemistry, 
manufacturing, and controls (CMC) regulatory programs were evaluated 
with the following objectives in mind:
• Encourage the early adoption of new technological advances by the 
pharmaceutical industry
• Facilitate industry application of modern quality management 
techniques, including implementation of quality systems 
approaches, to all aspects of pharmaceutical production and quality 
assurance
• Encourage implementation of risk-based approaches that focus both 
industry and agency attention on critical areas
• Ensure regulatory review, compliance, and inspection policies are 
based on state-of-the-art pharmaceutical science
• Enhance the consistency and coordination of FDA’s drug quality 
regulatory programs, in part by further integrating enhanced 
quality systems approaches into the Agency’s business processes 
and regulatory policies concerning review and inspection activities
Early in the initiative, a number of multidisciplinary working groups were 
formed, comprising FDA experts from various areas of scientific and 
regulatory practice within FDA. As a result of this work, FDA completed 
its assessment of the existing cGMP programs and began to develop the 
product quality regulatory system of the future, following these guiding 14  Chapter One
principles, in order to minimize the risks to the public health associated 
with pharmaceutical product manufacturing:
• Risk-based orientation
• Science-based policies and standards
• Integrated quality systems orientation
• International cooperation
• Strong public health protection
FDA identified a risk-based orientation as one of the driving principles of 
the cGMP initiative. The progress outlined below reflects FDA’s commit￾ment to the adoption of risk management principles that will enhance 
the Agency’s inspection and enforcement program, which is focused on 
protecting the public health. 
FDA’s Strategic Action Plan
The Agency’s strategic plan identified efficient risk management as a 
key element. Efficient risk management requires using the best scientific 
data, developing quality standards, and using efficient systems and prac￾tices that provide clear and consistent decisions and communications for 
the American public and regulated industry. FDA identified efficient risk 
management as the primary way to make the most effective use of Agency 
resources and address these challenges. This approach incorporates rigor￾ous analysis to consistently identify the most important risks, and the use 
of a quality systems approach to designing, conducting, and evaluating 
FDA core business processes.
Risk-Based Model for Inspectional Oversight
The Agency also developed a risk-based model for prioritizing sites for 
manufacturing inspections, which is discussed in Chapter 5.
Part 11 Guidance
With the issuance in 2003 of the guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic 
Records, Electronic Signatures—Scope and Application, many barriers to 
scientific and technological advances were removed, and the use of risk￾based approaches to managing computer systems is encouraged.Introduction to Quality Risk Management  15
Aseptic Processing Guidance
The final guidance for industry published in 2004, Sterile Drug Products 
Produced by Aseptic Processing—Current Good Manufacturing Process, 
advocates a risk-based framework, underscoring the value of proactive 
approaches to ensuring sterility. Among the sections of the guidance that 
address risk-based approaches are those relating to key roles played by 
personnel, design, environmental control, and media fills in an aseptic 
processing operation. This guidance states that “nearly all drugs recalled 
due to non-sterility or lack of sterility assurance in the period spanning 
1980–2000 were produced via aseptic processing.” (Food and Drug 
Administration 2004a)
In February 2023, FDA warned consumers and healthcare practitioners 
not to purchase and also to immediately stop using two brands of artificial 
tears due to potential bacterial contamination. These were over-the￾counter products, manufactured by Global Pharma Healthcare Private 
Limited, intended to be sterile. Global Pharma initiated a voluntary recall 
at the consumer level of all unexpired lots of EzriCare Artificial Tears and 
Delsam Pharma’s Artificial Tears. FDA recommended this recall due to 
the company’s current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) violations, 
including lack of appropriate microbial testing, formulation issues (the 
company manufactures and distributes ophthalmic drugs in multi-use 
bottles, without an adequate preservative), and lack of proper controls 
concerning tamper-evident packaging.
As of January 31, 2023, the CDC identified 55 patients in 12 states 
with infections that have been linked by epidemiologic and laboratory 
evidence to the use of EzriCare Artificial Tears. Associated adverse 
events include hospitalization, one death with bloodstream infection, 
and permanent vision loss from eye infections. The CDC issued an alert 
recommending consumers stop using EzriCare Artificial Tears pending 
additional guidance from the CDC and FDA.
FDA also placed Global Pharma Healthcare Private Limited on import 
alert for providing an inadequate response to a records request and for 
not complying with cGMP requirements. The import alert prevents these 
products from entering the United States. As of May 15, 2023, CDC iden￾tified 81 patients in 18 states with a rare strain of extensively drug-resistant 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fourteen patients had vision loss, an addi￾tional four patients required enucleation (surgical removal of eyeball), and 
four died. 16  Chapter One
MORE THAN SAFETY RISKS: 
FROM SAFETY RISKS TO 
QUALITY BY DESIGN 
An effective risk management process involves many complex and 
interrelated activities whose final goal is to protect the patient and users of 
medical products, which is exactly the mission of FDA. 
When properly managed, the risk management process will help 
regulated companies ensure customers’ and users’ safety, and protect 
company value and reputation. On the other hand, when ineffective risk 
management processes are in place, some consequences can be:
• Injuries and even deaths related to unsafe medical products
• Regulatory actions, including costly product recalls, warning 
letters, and even injunctions
• Tarnished corporate image
• Decreased value for stakeholders and stockholders
Better design of medical products, including the design of their manu￾facturing and quality control processes, is a critical element of the risk 
management process. However, there is another crucial phase, which is 
during the use of the product. To minimize this type of risk (for example, 
an error when using a medical device or taking a drug), FDA developed 
specific guidances, among them:
• Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), which require 
medication guides for some drug and biological products
• Quality by Design, which aims to design safer and better drugs and 
biotechnology products
• Design Control Guidance for Medical Device Manufacturers, 
which is focused on meeting user needs 
• Do It by Design: An Introduction to Human Factors in 
Medical Devices
Medication Guides 
Medication guides were introduced in the late 1990s for products perceived 
to pose “serious and significant public health concerns.” It was manda￾tory for pharmacists to distribute them at the time of drug dispensing. 
For some medical products (mainly drug and biological products) that Introduction to Quality Risk Management  17
FDA determines pose a serious and significant public health concern, 
distribution of FDA-approved patient medication information that is 
necessary to patients’ safe and effective use of the drug products is 
required. It is called a medication guide, and it applies to products used 
primarily on an outpatient basis without direct supervision by a healthcare 
professional. These regulations are codified in 21 CFR part 208. 
Quality by Design
Quality by design (QbD) is a concept first outlined by well-known quality 
expert Joseph M. Juran in various publications, most notably Juran on 
Quality by Design. Juran believed that quality could be planned, and that 
most quality crises and problems relate to the way in which quality was 
planned in the first place. QbD is a systematic approach to the development 
of new products and processes, and it begins with predefined objectives, 
emphasizes product and process understanding and process control, and is 
based on sound science and quality risk management. 
The concept promotes industry’s understanding of the product and 
manufacturing process, starting with product development, basically build￾ing quality in, not testing it in. Under this concept, when designing and 
developing a product, a company needs to define desired product per￾formance and identify its critical quality attributes (CQAs). Based on 
this information, the company then designs the product formulation and 
process to meet these product attributes. 
This leads to an understanding of the impact of raw material attributes 
and process parameters on the CQAs, and identification and control of 
sources of variability. As a result of all this knowledge, a company can 
continually monitor and update its manufacturing process to assure consis￾tent product quality. This systematic approach to product development and 
manufacturing varies a great deal from the traditional approach, which was 
extremely empirical.
While QbD principles have been used to advance product and process 
quality in every industry, particularly the automotive industry, they have 
most recently been adopted by FDA as a vehicle for the transformation of 
how drugs are discovered, developed, and commercially manufactured. 
During an FDA presentation at the 2007 PDA/FDA Joint Conference 
2007, the Agency presented the following benefits from the adequate 
implementation of QbD:
• Enhancing the scientific foundation for review
• Providing for better coordination across review, compliance, 
and inspection18  Chapter One
• Improving information in regulatory submissions
• Providing for better consistency
• Improving the quality of preapproval review
• Providing for more flexibility in decision-making
• Ensuring decisions are made based on science and not on 
empirical information 
• Involving various disciplines in decision-making
• Using resources to address higher risks
Benefits for the industry include:
• Ensuring better design of products with fewer problems in 
manufacturing
• Reducing the number of manufacturing supplements required for 
post-market changes, and fostering reliance on process and risk 
understanding and risk mitigation
• Allowing for implementation of new technology to improve 
manufacturing without regulatory scrutiny
• Allowing for possible reduction in overall costs of manufacturing 
(less waste) 
• Ensuring less hassle during review (fewer deficiencies, 
quicker approvals)
• Improving interaction with FDA—dealing on a science level 
instead of on a process level
• Allowing for continuous improvements in products and 
manufacturing processes
• Allowing for better understanding of how active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (APIs) and excipients affect manufacturing
• Relating manufacturing to clinical considerations during design
• Providing a better overall business model
Design Controls for Medical Devices
Risk management is the systematic application of management policies, 
procedures, and practices to the tasks of identifying, analyzing, controlling, Introduction to Quality Risk Management  19
and monitoring risk. It is intended to be a framework within which experi￾ence, insight, and judgment are applied to successfully manage risk. It is 
included in this guidance because of its effect on the design process.
Risk management begins with the development of the design input 
requirements. As the design evolves, new risks may become evident. To 
systematically identify and, when necessary, reduce these risks, the risk 
management process is integrated into the design process. In this way, 
unacceptable risks can be identified and managed earlier in the design 
process, when changes are easier to make and less costly.
An example of this is an exposure control system for a general-purpose 
X-ray system. The control function was allocated to software. Late in the 
development process, risk analysis of the system uncovered several failure 
modes that could result in overexposure to the patient. Because the problem 
was not identified until the design was near completion, an expensive, 
independent backup timer had to be added to monitor exposure times.
The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 added design validation 
requirements to the cGMP requirements in section 520(f) of the Act. 
Section 820.30 of the Quality System Regulation (QSR) lists the design 
control requirements that manufacturers should satisfy to be in compliance. 
Design Control Guidance for Medical Device Manufacturers is 
another document that may assist manufacturers in understanding the intent 
of the design control requirements. This manual interprets the language of 
the QSR and explains the underlying concepts in practical terms.
Do It by Design: An Introduction to Human Factors in Medical 
Devices is a document that contains background information about 
human factors as a discipline, describes and illustrates device problems, 
and discusses human factors principles and methods as a part of the 
design control system. Both of these manuals are possible resources 
for manufacturers that are either developing or improving their design 
control system. 
The design controls section 820.30 of the QSR applies to the design 
of products and processes, and changes to existing designs and processes. 
Changes to existing designs should be made in accordance with design 
control requirements even if the original design was not subject to these 
requirements. Each manufacturer of any class III or class II device, and 
a few categories of class I devices, including automated devices with 
computer software, shall establish and maintain procedures to control 
the design of the device to ensure certain specified design requirements 
are met. 20  Chapter One
ISO 31000
The international standard ISO 31000 is intended to be a family of standards 
relating to risk management codified by the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO). The purpose of ISO 31000:2018 is to provide 
principles and generic guidelines on risk management. ISO 31000 seeks to 
provide a universally recognized paradigm for practitioners and companies 
employing risk management processes to replace the myriad of existing 
standards, methodologies, and paradigms that differ between industries 
and regions, and by subject matter.
The purpose of ISO 31000:2018 is to be applicable and adaptable 
for “any public, private or community enterprise, association, group or 
individual.” Accordingly, the general scope of ISO 31000—as a family of 
risk management standards—was not developed with a particular industry 
group, management system, or subject matter field in mind, but rather to 
provide best practice structure and guidance to all operations concerned 
with risk management.
ISO 31000:2018 provides principles and generic guidelines on risk 
management, and it can be applied throughout the life of an organization 
and to a wide range of activities, including strategies and decisions, 
operations, processes, functions, projects, products, services, and assets. 
ISO 31000:2018 can be applied to any type of risk, whatever its nature, 
whether having positive or negative consequences. 
Although ISO 31000:2018 provides generic guidelines, it is not 
intended to promote uniformity of risk management across organizations. 
The design and implementation of risk management plans and frameworks 
should take into account the varying needs of a specific organization, its 
particular objectives, context, structure, operations, processes, functions, 
projects, products, services, or assets, and specific practices employed. It 
is intended that ISO 31000:2018 be utilized to harmonize risk management 
processes in existing and future standards. It provides a common approach 
in support of standards dealing with specific risks and/or sectors, but does 
not replace those standards. ISO 31000:2018 is not intended for the purpose 
of certification.
Currently, the ISO 31000 family includes:
• ISO 31000:2018 Risk management—Guidelines
• IEC 31010:2019 Risk management—Risk assessment techniques
• ISO 31073:2022 Risk management—VocabularyIntroduction to Quality Risk Management  21
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
AND CURRENT SITUATION
The roots of modern risk management can be tied to a cohort of regulatory 
initiatives in the latter part of the past century. The decision to approve 
a drug or any medical product (and its classification as prescription or 
nonprescription) is highly dependent on the answer to the following 
question: “Do the benefits of the medical product outweigh the risks?” 
Both manufacturers and FDA continually evaluate the potential benefits of 
a medical product versus its potential risks. Many factors are considered, 
some of which include:
• Seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated
• Size of the patient population
• Expected benefit of the medical product
• Expected duration of treatment
• Seriousness of the known or potential adverse events
These evaluations are performed not only prior to the approval of a new 
medical product but also throughout the entire life cycle of the product. 
This serves as a means to continuously assess the safety and efficacy of 
existing product based on adverse event reports and results from post￾marketing clinical studies.
In 1960, FDA instituted a policy of full disclosure. Manufacturers were 
required (and still are) to provide complete information about the product’s 
indication, dosing, side effects, and so on, to healthcare professionals. This 
information is included in the product labeling. 
The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 is another early example 
of risk management. The CSA regulates manufacturers, prescribers, and 
dispensers as well as the label and warning text, providing additional 
indicators of risk and tools to manage those risks beyond those established 
under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Common 
tools included boxed warnings and “Dear Healthcare Provider” letters.
The safe and effective use of drugs was the reason FDA endorsed the 
requirement in the late 1970s to distribute patient package inserts (PPIs) 
with oral contraceptives and estrogen replacements to patients. Prior safety 
communications were geared toward healthcare professionals. Since oral 
contraceptives and estrogens were considered elective medications, FDA 
insisted that patients (consumers) be provided with written information 
about the benefits and risks of taking these products to assist in their 
decision about birth control methods.22  Chapter One
Special programs that extended beyond labeling and PPIs to restrict 
access to certain risky products were instituted between 1988 and 1998. 
Some products (Accutane, Clozaril, and thalidomide, for example) had 
specifically designed programs to detect or prevent serious adverse events. 
In the case of thalidomide, used to treat complications of leprosy, it was 
approved in the United States (1998) with The System for Thalidomide 
Education and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.). The program required that 
all patients, pharmacists, and physicians be registered, and that patients be 
tested for pregnancy to avoid the potential for birth defects.
In the late 1990s, after the removal of a number of high-profile 
drugs from the market due to emergent safety concerns (for example, 
fenfluramine), FDA’s efforts with respect to drug safety, both pre- and post￾marketing, came under scrutiny. Questions arose about the pre-market and 
post-market assessments of safety and drug risks and whether the shorter 
review time frames specified by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 
1992 (PDUFA) were resulting in the approval of more-dangerous drugs. 
As one of her first initiatives after being sworn in as FDA Commissioner 
in 1998, Dr. Jane Henney established a task force to evaluate the system 
for managing the risks of FDA-approved medical products, focusing 
particularly on FDA’s part in the system. The result of that review was 
published in May 1999 (Managing the Risks from Medical Product Use: 
Creating a Risk Management Framework, report to the FDA commissioner 
from the task force on risk management). This report heralded the modern 
risk management era (Food and Drug Administration 1999b).
The task force assessed risk management practices within the overall 
healthcare delivery system, focusing on the roles and responsibilities of 
each participant. The task force applied a risk management model used in 
other federal sectors. They also examined the various risks from medical 
products and their sources. The task force then evaluated FDA’s role in 
the current system. First, they reviewed the Agency’s pre-marketing risk 
assessment and approval processes to determine if serious adverse events 
were occurring at a higher rate than they had in the past. Next, the task 
force evaluated FDA’s post-marketing surveillance and risk assessment 
programs to see if they were doing the job they were intended to do. 
Finally, the task force analyzed all of FDA’s risk management activities 
to evaluate the Agency’s role in the overall system for managing medical 
product risks. Medical products provide great benefit to the public, but they 
can also cause injury. 
FDA and the many other participants in healthcare delivery act to 
maximize the benefits and minimize the risks associated with using 
medical products, but often the actions of the participants are insufficiently Introduction to Quality Risk Management  23
integrated. The task force believed that the common goal of maximizing 
benefits and minimizing risks could be greatly advanced if the participants 
in the system worked together to gain an understanding of these activities 
within a systems framework. To achieve such a framework, it is necessary 
to gain a better understanding of the risks involved and their sources, and 
it is also necessary to clarify the role of each stakeholder and ensure that 
these individual roles are well integrated. Only then can effective risk 
management strategies be planned.
In July 2006 the Parenteral Drug Association’s (PDA) Risk Manage￾ment Task Force for Aseptic Processes conducted an electronic survey 
among its members to determine current industry practices regarding 
implementation of quality risk management in their organizations. This 
electronic survey was open and publicly available via the PDA website and 
targeted professionals in the regulated industry (pharmaceutical, medical 
devices, and biotechnology manufacturers) who are involved in initiating, 
implementing, or reviewing risk management programs or decisions 
in their organizations. One hundred twenty-nine members participated 
(Ahmed et al. 2008). 
Among the major findings were:
• The “aseptic processing/filling” operation is the functional area 
identified as having the greatest need for risk assessment and 
quality risk management.
• The most widely used methodology in industry to identify risk 
is failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). This tool is most 
widely applied in assessing change control and for adverse event, 
complaint, or failure investigations.
• Despite the fact that personnel training was identified as the 
strategy most used for controlling/minimizing risk, the largest 
contributors to sterility failure in operations are still “personnel.” 
• Most companies still rely on “manufacturing controls” to mitigate 
risk and deem the utilization of process analytical technology 
(PAT) least important in this aspect. 
• A majority of correspondents verified that they did not periodically 
assess their risk management programs. 
• A majority of the correspondents desired to see case studies or 
examples of risk analysis implementation (as applicable to aseptic 
processing) in future PDA technical reports on risk management.24  Chapter One
ISO 9001:2015 RISK REQUIREMENTS
ISO 9001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for 
a quality management system (QMS). Organizations use the standard to 
demonstrate their ability to consistently provide products and services that 
meet customer and regulatory requirements. It is the most popular standard 
in the ISO 9000 series and the only standard in the series to which organi￾zations can certify. 
ISO 9001 was first published in 1987 by the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO), an international agency composed of the 
national standards bodies of more than 160 countries. The current version 
(fifth edition) of ISO 9001 was released in September 2015.
There are many elements of risk-based thinking in the ISO 9001:2015 
international standard that may affect organizations as they work toward 
compliance to the standard. The following excerpts and summaries 
describe references to risk in ISO 9001:2015 (International Organization 
for Standardization 2015):
Under Introduction, Section 0.1 General, the standard establishes that 
“the adoption of a quality management system is a strategic decision for an 
organization that can help to improve its overall performance and provide 
a sound basis for sustainable development initiatives.” And it cites as one 
of the main potential benefits of implementing a QMS based on this inter￾national standard the addressing of risks and opportunities associated with 
its context and objectives. 
This international standard employs the process approach, which 
incorporates the plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle and risk-based thinking. 
Risk-based thinking enables an organization to determine the factors that 
could cause its processes and its QMS to deviate from the planned results, 
to put in place preventive controls to minimize negative effects, and to 
make maximum use of opportunities as they arise.
Under Section 0.3 Process approach, 0.3.1 General, this international 
standard establishes that “the process approach involves the systematic 
definition and management of processes, and their interactions, so as to 
achieve the intended results in accordance with the quality policy and 
strategic direction of the organization. Management of the processes and 
the system as a whole can be achieved using the PDCA cycle with an overall 
focus on risk-based thinking aimed at taking advantage of opportunities 
and preventing undesirable results.”
The plan element of the PDCA cycle establishes the objectives of the 
system and its processes, and the resources needed to deliver results in 
accordance with customers’ requirements and the organization’s policies 
and identify and address risks and opportunities.Introduction to Quality Risk Management  25
In Section 0.3.3 Risk-based thinking, this international standard 
establishes that risk-based thinking:
is essential for achieving an effective quality management system. 
The concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous 
editions of this International Standard including, for example, 
carrying out preventive action to eliminate potential noncon￾formities, analyzing any nonconformities that do occur, and 
taking action to prevent recurrence that is appropriate for the 
effects of the nonconformity.
To conform to the requirements of this International Standard, 
an organization needs to plan and implement actions to address 
risks and opportunities. Addressing both risks and opportunities 
establishes a basis for increasing the effectiveness of the quality 
management system, achieving improved results and preventing 
negative effects.
Opportunities can arise as a result of a situation favorable to 
achieving an intended result, for example, a set of circumstances 
that allow the organization to attract customers, develop new 
products and services, reduce waste or improve productivity. 
Actions to address opportunities can also include consideration 
of associated risks. Risk is the effect of uncertainty and any 
such uncertainty can have positive or negative effects. A positive 
deviation arising from a risk can provide an opportunity, but not 
all positive effects of risk result in opportunities.
It declares that this international standard enables an organization to use the 
process approach, coupled with the PDCA cycle and risk-based thinking, 
to align or integrate its QMS with the requirements of other management 
system standards.
Under Section 4.4 Quality management system and its processes, 
Subsection 4.4.1, it establishes that “The organization shall address the 
risks and opportunities as determined in accordance with the requirements 
of section 6.1.”
Under Section 5.1 Leadership and commitment, Subsection 5.1.1 
General, it establishes that “Top management shall demonstrate leadership 
and commitment with respect to the quality management system by pro￾moting the use of the process approach and risk-based thinking.” 
Under Section 5.1.2. Customer focus, it establishes that “Top manage￾ment shall demonstrate leadership and commitment with respect to 
customer focus by ensuring that the risks and opportunities that can affect 
conformity of products and services and the ability to enhance customer 
satisfaction are determined and addressed.”26  Chapter One
Under Section 6 Planning, Subsection 6.1 Actions to address risk and 
opportunities, it includes as part of Subsection 6.1.1, “When planning for 
the quality management system, the organization shall consider the issues 
referred to in 4.1 and the requirements referred to in 4.2 and determine the 
risks and opportunities that need to be addressed to:
a. give assurance that the quality management system can achieve 
its intended result(s);
b. enhance desirable effects;
c. prevent, or reduce, undesired effects;
d. achieve improvement.”
Under Subsection 6.1.2, it establishes that the organization shall plan 
actions to address these risks and opportunities, and how to integrate and 
implement the actions into its QMS processes and evaluate the effectiveness 
of these actions. It also establishes that “Actions taken to address risks 
and opportunities shall be proportionate to the potential impact on the 
conformity of products and services.” 
Under Note 1, it establishes that “Options to address risks can include 
avoiding risk, taking risk in order to pursue an opportunity, eliminating the 
risk source, changing the likelihood or consequences, sharing the risk, or 
retaining risk by informed decision.”
Under Section 9 Performance evaluation, Subsection 9.1 Monitoring, 
measurement, analysis and evaluation, Subsection 9.1.3 Analysis and 
evaluation, it establishes that “The organization shall analyze and evaluate 
appropriate data and information arising from monitoring and measure￾ment. The results of analysis shall be used to evaluate … the effectiveness 
of actions taken to address risks and opportunities.”
Under Section 9.3 Management review, Subsection 9.3.2 Management 
review inputs, it establishes that “The management review shall be planned 
and carried out taking into consideration …the effectiveness of actions 
taken to address risks and opportunities (see 6.1).”
Under Section 10 Improvement, Subsection 10.2 Nonconformity and 
corrective action, Subsection 10.2.1, it establishes that “When a noncon￾formity occurs, including any arising from complaints, the organization 
shall … update risks and opportunities determined during planning, 
if necessary.” 
This international standard also includes Annex A (informative), 
Clarification of new structure, terminology and concepts. As part of this 
annex, the following three elements are tied to risk requirements:Introduction to Quality Risk Management  27
A.4 Risk-based thinking
The concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous 
editions of this International Standard, e.g. through requirements 
for planning, review, and improvement. This International Stan￾dard specifies requirements for the organization to understand 
its context (see 4.1) and determine risks as a basis for planning 
(see 6.1). This represents the application of risk-based thinking to 
planning and implementing quality management system processes 
(see 4.4) and will assist in determining the extent of documented 
information.
One of the key purposes of a quality management system is to 
act as a preventive tool. Consequently, this International Standard 
does not have a separate clause or subclause on preventive action. 
The concept of preventive action is expressed through the use of 
risk-based thinking in formulating quality management system 
requirements.
The risk-based thinking applied in this International Stan￾dard has enabled some reduction in prescriptive requirements 
and their replacement by performance-based requirements. There 
is greater flexibility than in ISO 9001:2008 in the requirements 
for processes, documented information and organizational 
responsibilities.
Although 6.1 specifies that the organization shall plan actions 
to address risks, there is no requirement for formal methods for 
risk management or a documented risk management process. 
Organizations can decide whether or not to develop a more exten￾sive risk management methodology than is required by this Inter￾national Standard, e.g. through the application of other guidance 
or standards.
Not all the processes of a quality management system repre￾sent the same level of risk in terms of the organization’s ability to 
meet its objectives, and the effects of uncertainty are not the same 
for all organizations. Under the requirements of 6.1, the organi￾zation is responsible for its application of risk-based thinking and 
the actions it takes to address risk, including whether or not to 
retain documented information as evidence of its determination 
of risks.28  Chapter One
A.5 Applicability
This International Standard does not refer to “exclusions” in rela￾tion to the applicability of its requirements to the organization’s 
quality management system. However, an organization can review 
the applicability of requirements due to the size or complexity of 
the organization, the management model it adopts, the range of 
the organization’s activities and the nature of the risks and oppor￾tunities it encounters.
A.8 Control of externally provided processes, products 
and services
The organization can apply risk-based thinking to determine 
the type and extent of controls appropriate to particular external 
providers and externally provided processes, products and services.
Risk Management and Preventive Actions
One of the key purposes of implementing a QMS is to act as a preven￾tive tool. As a result, the formal requirement related to preventive action 
(existing since the 1994 version of ISO 9001) was removed in the 2015 
version and replaced with the requirement for risk-based thinking. 
ISO 9001:2015 emphasizes proactive error-proofing processes to pre￾vent problems from occurring because detection (along with root cause 
identification and corrective action implementation) is not as effective as it 
should be. Therefore, the aim of the new standard is that planning the QMS 
up front is the best preventive action, making a clause tied to corrective 
action unnecessary.
The former corrective action clause (8.5.2 in ISO 9001:2008) has been 
replaced by a new clause named “Nonconformity and corrective action” 
(10.2), while the preventive action clause (8.5.3 in ISO 9001:2008) has been 
deleted and its spirit has been incorporated as part of a new clause (6.1) 
named “Actions to address risks and opportunities.”
The spirit of the new ISO 9001:2015 standard is already present in 
concepts such as pharmaceutical quality by design and medical device 
design controls. Risk-based thinking and preventive actions are key parts of 
the design and development process. Moreover, the strong emphasis on risk 
management in this new version of the standard has already been embraced 
by the regulated industry with the incorporation of such concepts through 
guidances (ICH Q9 for pharmaceuticals) and international standards (ISO 
14971 for medical devices or ISO 22000 for food).Introduction to Quality Risk Management  29
Organizations rarely apply the preventive action concept at the optimal 
stage in a QMS because of cost or time limitations. Preventing every 
potential problem and nonconformance is prohibitively expensive or even 
impossible. ISO 9001:2015’s requirement of risk-based thinking can help to 
prevent major failures and issues, but it’s unlikely that it will prevent a vast 
majority of potential problems. I believe that our current understanding of 
the preventive action concept (when correctly interpreted and applied) will 
survive for many years. Who can be opposed to extending any identified 
improvement to other products, processes, or systems not yet affected by an 
identified root cause(s)?2
Current Initiatives
FDA-WIDE
FDA oversees the public health standards of an industry that produces 
trillions of dollars worth of regulated products. The products include 
the entire food supply (except for meat and poultry), over-the-counter 
and prescription medications, blood products, vaccines, tissues for trans￾plantation, medical equipment and implantable devices, devices that emit 
radiation, animal drugs and feeds, and cosmetics. The Agency currently 
also regulates tobacco products. FDA faces two challenges in assuring that 
U.S. citizens fully reap the health benefits of modern medical technology 
and enjoy a safe and nutritious food supply:
1. FDA must assure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics, 
food additives, medicated animal feeds, and medical devices before they 
are allowed on the market. This challenge means keeping pace with 
the increasing scientific complexity of products. FDA scientists must 
accurately judge the readiness of these products to be marketed and help 
these innovative products reach the market as quickly as possible.
There must also be a sufficient number of reviewers to handle the 
product review workload in order to provide timely feedback to application 
sponsors to identify and address deficiencies. Any delays might:
• Postpone critically needed disease prevention and treatment, 
especially for a growing population of elderly and immune￾compromised patients
• Increase the cost of bringing a new product to market by 
lengthening the time a product is in development
• Result in fewer low-cost alternatives for patients (including 
children and the elderly)
3132  Chapter Two
2. FDA must also monitor the safety of products once they are on the 
market. U.S. consumers use products that are manufactured worldwide 
and make their way to the market through a wide variety of distribution 
channels. To ensure that these products are safe, the Agency must oversee 
their entire life cycle—from production through distribution and use/
consumption.
On August 21, 2002, FDA announced a major new initiative pertaining to 
drug quality regulation: Pharmaceutical cGMPs for the 21st Century: A 
Risk-Based Approach. In the initial concept paper issued on the initiative, 
FDA identified “a risk-based orientation” as one of the guiding principles 
that would drive the initiative. The concept paper stated that “resource 
limitations prevent uniformly intensive coverage of all pharmaceutical 
products and production” and that “to provide the most effective public 
health protection, FDA must match its level of effort against the magnitude 
of the risk.”
The concept paper noted that in the short term, FDA intended to place 
more emphasis on risk-based allocation of resources for the oversight 
of drug quality. However, the concept paper also acknowledged that 
developing more systematic and risk-based approaches would be a long￾term effort and that an intermediate step is to “use emerging science and 
data analysis to enhance compliance programs to target the highest risk 
areas.”
On August 20, 2003, FDA released its strategic action plan, Protecting 
and Advancing America’s Health. This strategic plan reflects the Agency’s 
continuing support and priority for the risk management goals of the 
Pharmaceutical cGMPs for the 21st Century initiative. The first core goal 
identified in the plan is “efficient risk management” directed toward 
“ensuring that the Agency’s limited resources can provide the most health 
promotion and protection at the least cost for the public.” The discussion of 
this goal specifically highlights the efforts of the Pharmaceutical cGMPs 
for the 21st Century initiative as central to the Agency’s risk management 
program. One of the objectives under this goal is to “provide high quality, 
cost-effective oversight of industry manufacturing, processing, and 
distribution to reduce risk.” Specifically identified under this objective 
is developing “new inspection approaches to more effectively utilize…
resources.” Also highlighted is the need to “use emerging science and data 
analysis to target the highest risk areas.”
In May 2022, FDA published a draft guidance intended to help 
stakeholders develop, maintain, and implement risk management plans to 
proactively assist in the prevention of human drug product and biological 
product shortages. The following pages describe standards, regulations, and Current Initiatives  33
guidance documents that have been published covering risk management 
activities for the different types of regulated products.
DRUGS AND 
BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS
ICH Q9(R1)
In September 2006 FDA adopted the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) Q9 document entitled “Quality Risk Management,” 
which was revised in May 2023. This guidance provides principles and 
examples of tools for quality risk management that can be applied to 
different aspects of pharmaceutical quality. These aspects include develop￾ment, manufacturing, distribution, inspection, and submission/review 
processes throughout the life cycle of drug substances, drug products, 
and biological and biotechnological products (including the use of raw 
materials, solvents, excipients, packaging and labeling materials in drug 
products, and biological and biotechnological products).
The manufacturing and use of a drug product, including its compo￾nents, necessarily entail some degree of risk. The risk to its quality is just 
one component of the overall risk. Product quality must be maintained 
throughout the product life cycle such that the attributes that are important 
to the quality of the drug product remain consistent with those used in 
preproduction and clinical studies. An effective quality risk management 
(QRM) approach can further ensure the high quality of the drug product to 
the patient by providing a proactive means to identify and control potential 
quality issues during development and manufacturing. In addition, use of 
QRM can improve decision-making if a quality problem arises. Effective 
QRM can facilitate better and more-informed decisions, provide regulators 
with greater assurance of a company’s ability to deal with potential risks, 
and beneficially affect the extent and level of direct regulatory oversight.
The purpose of this document is to offer a systematic approach to 
QRM. It serves as a foundation or resource document that is independent 
of other ICH quality documents, but it supports and complements existing 
quality practices, requirements, standards, and guidelines within the 
pharmaceutical industry and regulatory environment. 
ICH Q9(R1) provides guidance on the principles and some of the tools 
of QRM that can enable more effective and consistent risk-based decisions, 
by both regulators and industry, regarding the quality of drug substances 
and drug products across the product life cycle. It is not intended to 
create any new expectations beyond the current regulatory requirements. 34  Chapter Two
It is neither always appropriate nor always necessary to use a formal risk 
management process (using recognized tools and/or internal procedures, 
for example, standard operating procedures). The use of informal risk 
management processes (using empirical tools and/or internal procedures) 
can also be considered acceptable. Appropriate use of QRM can facilitate 
but does not obviate industry’s obligation to comply with regulatory 
requirements and does not replace appropriate communications between 
industry and regulators.
The objectives of the revision were improvement in four areas:
1. Subjectivity in QRM risk assessments and outcomes
2. Insufficient management of supply and product availability risks
3. Lack of understanding of QRM formalities
4. Lack of clarity about risk-based decision-making
According to the ICH business plan, adoption of the revised guideline 
would result in “more scientific and robust applications of QRM principles, 
tools, and activities, where subjectivity in QRM outputs is better controlled. 
This could lead to more science-based manufacturing operations, control 
strategies, and validation activities, which may result in fewer quality 
defects and recalls for patients, and potentially in reduced costs for the 
pharmaceutical industry and healthcare systems.”
The revised guideline introduces new text acknowledging that some 
degree of subjectivity in QRM is unavoidable while offering methods to 
reduce or control subjectivity. The guideline states that “while subjectivity 
cannot be completely eliminated from quality risk management activities, 
it may be controlled by addressing bias, the proper use of quality risk 
management tools and maximizing the use of relevant data and sources 
of knowledge.”
All personnel involved with QRM activities should “acknowledge, 
anticipate, and address the potential for subjectivity,” according to the 
revised guidance. Furthermore, decision-makers should ensure that such 
subjectivity is “controlled and minimized” to allow for more “robust risk￾based decision making.” 
The revision also includes a new section on formality in QRM. 
The guideline states that “an understanding of formality in quality risk 
management … may lead to resources being used more efficiently, where 
lower risk issues are dealt with via less formal means, freeing up resources 
for managing higher risk issues and more complex problems that may 
require increased levels of rigor and effort.”Current Initiatives  35
The revision also has new text on the role of QRM in addressing prod￾uct availability risks. It states that “quality/manufacturing issues, includ￾ing non-compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), are a 
frequent cause of product availability issues (for example, product short￾ages). The interests of patients are served by risk-based drug shortage 
prevention and mitigation activities that help to proactively manage supply 
chain complexities and ensure availability of needed medicines. An effec￾tive pharmaceutical quality system drives both supply chain robustness and 
sustainable GMP compliance.”
Within the revised guideline, the term “risk identification” has been 
replaced with “hazard identification” to harmonize with discussion in the 
risk assessment portion of the guidance. The section on risk review, how￾ever, remains unchanged.
QbD Guidances 
Quality by design (QbD) means designing and developing a product and 
associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product 
development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined 
quality at the end of the manufacturing process. It means building quality 
into the process and product in a systematic, science- and risk-based 
manner. Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a 
sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process under￾standing from product development to the commercial manufacturing 
processes and for post-development changes and optimization. This 
concept is not new. In fact, the 1976 cGMP regulations, when viewed in 
their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. 
The QbD concepts were outlined in the ICH Q8(R2), Q9, and Q10 
guidelines. These documents, already adopted by FDA, provide the 
foundation for implementing QbD during specific stages of product 
development. Putting the QbD process into place requires several steps. 
First, you want to define the desired product performance up front and 
identify product critical quality attributes (CQAs). Next, you design 
formulation and process to meet product CQAs. A critical component of 
QbD is understanding the needs of the patient and the specific quality 
attributes of the product that are linked to safety and efficacy. Thus, to 
implement QbD it is fundamental to understand the functional relationships 
between patient needs, product quality attributes, analytical capabilities, 
and the manufacturing process. 
Pharmaceutical companies begin by identifying product requirements 
for meeting patient needs and then determining the quality target product 
profile (QTPP) and the CQAs required to meet those patient needs. 
a) give assurance that the quality 
management system can achieve its 
intended result(s);
b) enhance desirable effects;
c) prevent, or reduce, undesired 
effects;
d) achieve improvement.”36  Chapter Two
Based on this information, the company then designs the molecule, the 
manufacturing process, and the control strategy to ensure the desired 
product quality is met consistently. The QbD approach can be maintained 
throughout the life cycle of the product to facilitate innovation and continu￾ous improvement based on expanded knowledge and new technologies. 
This knowledge is gained during development and grows with more 
manufacturing experience through process characterization, scale-up, 
technology transfer, and manufacture, as well as through increased patient 
exposure to the product. This approach encourages incorporating prior 
process and product knowledge and experience-based methodologies into 
manufacturing throughout the life of the product. 
When a product is developed using a QbD approach, the impact of 
raw and starting materials and process parameters on product quality are 
well understood, and the sources of process and product variability are 
well known and controlled. In contrast, traditional pharmaceutical manu￾facturing relies heavily on end product testing, and the process typically 
lacks the flexibility needed to respond to variables encountered during 
manufacturing. The outcome is often “quality by conformance” and a rigid, 
static manufacturing operation that is more susceptible to multiple manu￾facturing changes post licensure, thus requiring continuous updating of the 
application through burdensome global regulatory supplements, variations, 
or amendments. 
QbD is a systematic approach to product and process design and devel￾opment, and it includes the following key elements: 
• Targeting the product profile 
• Determining the CQAs
• Linking raw material attributes and process parameters to CQAs 
and performing risk assessment 
• Developing a design space 
• Designing and implementing a control strategy 
• Managing the product life cycle, including continual improvement
Critical Quality Attributes. A CQA is a physical, chemical, biological, 
or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an 
appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product 
quality. CQAs are generally associated with the drug substance, excipients, 
intermediates (in-process materials), and drug product. 
CQAs of solid oral dosage forms are typically those aspects affecting 
product purity, strength, drug release, and stability. CQAs for other delivery Current Initiatives  37
systems can additionally include more product-specific aspects, such as 
aerodynamic properties for inhaled products, sterility for parenterals, and 
adhesion properties for transdermal patches. For drug substances, raw 
materials, and intermediates, the CQAs can additionally include those 
properties that affect drug product CQAs (for example, particle size distri￾bution, bulk density). 
Potential drug product CQAs derived from the QTPP and/or prior 
knowledge are used to guide the product and process development. The 
list of potential CQAs can be modified when the formulation and manu￾facturing processes are selected and as product knowledge and process 
understanding increase. Quality risk management can be used to prioritize 
the list of potential CQAs for subsequent evaluation. Relevant CQAs 
can be identified by an iterative process of quality risk management and 
experimentation that assesses the extent to which their variation can have 
an impact on the quality of the drug product:
• The definition of “critical” varied.
• Most of the applications related CQAs to those attributes that have a 
direct impact on product quality, safety, and efficacy. 
• Most applications included CQAs for the drug product, but only 
some applications included CQAs for the drug substance. 
• Some applications considered properties of the drug substance 
affecting downstream manufacturing as a CQA. 
• Most applications related critical process parameters to CQAs. 
• Most applications considered a process parameter noncritical if well 
controlled or well within the design space. 
Risk Assessments. Risk assessment is a valuable science-based process 
used in quality risk management [see ICH Q9(R1)] that can aid in identi￾fying which material attributes and process parameters potentially have an 
effect on product CQAs. Risk assessment is typically performed early in the 
pharmaceutical development process and is repeated as more information 
becomes available and greater knowledge is obtained. 
Risk assessment tools can be used to identify and rank parameters (for 
example, process, equipment, input materials) with the potential to have 
an impact on product quality, based on prior knowledge and initial experi￾mental data. The initial list of potential parameters can be quite extensive 
but can be modified and prioritized by further studies. The list can be 
refined further through experimentation to determine the significance 
of individual variables and potential interactions. Once the significant 38  Chapter Two
parameters are identified, they can be further analyzed to achieve a higher 
level of process understanding.
With FDA moving forward with the QbD concept, risk management 
has become a priority process in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. 
QbD, according to ICH Q8(R), is based on sound science and quality risk 
management. It’s a systematic approach to development that begins with 
predefined objectives and an emphasis on product process understanding 
and process control. In order to achieve this, a risk management process 
has to be a priority.
Tools used in the risk assessment include the fishbone diagram, FMEA, 
and Pareto analysis, among others. A fishbone diagram is used to identify 
all potential variables, such as raw materials, compression parameters, and 
environmental factors, that can have an impact on a particular CQA, such 
as tablet hardness. An FMEA can then be used to rank the variables based 
on risk (a combination of probability, severity, and detectability) and to 
select the process parameters with higher risks for further studies to gain 
a greater understanding of their effects on CQAs. The risk assessment 
is prepared by a multidisciplinary team based on prior knowledge and 
experiments. 
Through the process of risk assessment and risk control, you want 
to understand the impact of material attributes and process parameters 
on product CQAs and then identify and control sources of variability in 
material and the process. 
The use of risk management in QbD will help to identify and 
link material attributes and process parameters to CQAs, enable early 
identification of risk to guide developmental efforts, and quantify the 
severity of harm and likelihood of occurrence. The benefits of risk assess￾ment are numerous. It can be used as a systematic approach to identifying 
and classifying parameters in the design space—useful in process develop￾ment, monitoring, improvement, and troubleshooting—and it is used to 
increase the assurance of quality. 
It is important to provide a systematic risk analysis of how raw 
materials, process steps, and process parameters affect product quality. The 
risk assessment that leads to the development of a comprehensive control 
strategy to reduce risk to product quality should be described, and the risk 
reduction and control should be discussed for changes that occur inside or 
outside the design space. Risk assessment can provide increased assurance 
to quality, because when process variability is identified and its linkage 
to product CQAs is understood, process and product controls reduce the 
impact of variability, and quality product will continue to be made when 
movement within the design space occurs in the future. Current Initiatives  39
A risk assessment also is important for effective communication 
between FDA and industry and for intracompany communication (such as 
between research/development and manufacturing and between multiple 
manufacturing sites), and within FDA, risk assessment allows for a 
dialogue between pre- and post-marketing review functions and between 
review, compliance, and field inspection staffs.
Design Space. FDA defines design space in its Guidance for Industry 
Q8 (2): Pharmaceutical Development (Food and Drug Administration 
2009b) as “The multidimensional combination and interaction of input 
variables (e.g., material attributes) and process parameters that have been 
demonstrated to provide assurance of quality. Working within the design 
space is not considered as a change. Movement out of the design space is 
considered to be a change and would normally initiate a regulatory post￾approval change process. Design space is proposed by the applicant and is 
subject to regulatory assessment and approval.”
The idea behind design space is that process variability leads to 
product variability. Monitoring the parameters of drug attributes results 
in less process variability and, ultimately, less product variability. The 
advantage of the design space is that it provides a wider range within which 
material attributes can vary in the future without supplemental regula￾tory approval.
In establishing and presenting a design space, some key points to 
consider are: 
• The effect of formulation-component properties on process 
performance and product quality 
• Multivariate interactions 
• Scale-up and equipment issues 
• The effect of operation or site change
• Uncertainty addressed with risk management
A control strategy is designed to ensure that a product of required quality 
will be produced consistently. The elements of the control strategy should 
describe and justify how in-process controls and the controls on input 
materials (drug substances and excipients), intermediates (in-process 
materials), container closure systems, and drug products contribute to the 
final product quality. These controls should be based on product, formu￾lation, and process understanding and should include, at a minimum, 
control of the critical process parameters and material attributes.40  Chapter Two
A control strategy can include, but is not limited to, the following: 
• Control of input material attributes (for example, drug substances, 
excipients, primary packaging materials) based on an understanding 
of their impact on manufacturability or product quality
• Product specifications
• Controls for unit operations that have an impact on downstream 
processing or product quality (for example, the impact of drying 
on degradation, particle size distribution of the granulate on 
dissolution)
• In-process or real-time release testing in lieu of end product testing 
(measurement and control of CQAs during processing)
• A monitoring program (full product testing at regular intervals) for 
verifying multivariate prediction models 
A control strategy can include different elements. For example, one element 
of the control strategy could rely on end product testing whereas another 
could depend on real-time release testing. The rationale for using these 
alternative approaches should be described in the submission.
Other points that can be considered include: 
• Better use of process knowledge and understanding in setting 
specifications 
• More meaningful sampling for drug product testing 
• Experience needed in setting real-time release specifications 
REMS and Medication Guides
The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) 
created new section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355-1), which authorizes FDA to require a Risk 
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) when necessary to ensure 
that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks. Under section 505-1(e), FDA 
may require that a REMS for a drug include one or more of the elements 
described in the subsection, including when the criteria in 21 CFR part 208 
are met—the requirement for an applicant to develop a Medication Guide 
for distribution to each patient when the drug is dispensed. 
Under part 208, Medication Guides may be safety-related, addressing 
serious risk(s) (relative to benefits) of which patients should be made aware, 
and/or efficacy-related, when patient adherence to directions for use is 
crucial to the drug’s effectiveness. Since the enactment of FDAAA, FDA Current Initiatives  41
has considered any new Medication Guide (or safety-related changes to an 
existing Medication Guide) to be part of a REMS. However, the Agency 
has the authority to determine, based on the risks of a drug and public 
health concern, whether a Medication Guide should be required as part of 
a REMS when the standard in part 208 is met, and may decide that the 
Medication Guide should be required as labeling but not part of a REMS if 
FDA determines that a REMS is not necessary to ensure that the benefits 
of the drug outweigh its risks. 
Section 208.1(a) states that Medication Guides apply primarily to 
human prescription drug products used on an outpatient basis without 
direct supervision by a healthcare professional, and are applicable to both 
new and refill prescriptions. Section 208.1(c) authorizes FDA to require a 
Medication Guide if FDA determines that one or more of the following 
circumstances exist: 
1. The drug product is one for which patient labeling could help 
prevent serious adverse effects.
2. The drug product is one that has serious risk(s) (relative to 
benefits) of which patients should be made aware because 
information concerning the risks could affect the patients’ 
decision to use, or continue to use, the product. 
3. The drug product is important to health, and patient adherence to 
directions for use is crucial to the drug’s effectiveness. 
Part 208 specifies the content and format of Medication Guides and 
manufacturer requirements to provide Medication Guides for distribution. 
Manufacturers of drug products for which a Medication Guide is required 
must both: 
• Obtain FDA approval of the Medication Guide before the 
Medication Guide is provided
• Ensure that Medication Guides are provided in sufficient numbers, 
or provide the means to produce Medication Guides in sufficient 
numbers, to distributors, packers, and authorized dispensers to 
permit the authorized dispenser to provide a Medication Guide to 
each patient receiving a prescription for the drug product 
Part 208 also specifies the requirements for distribution of Medication 
Guides: 
• Distributors and packers who receive the Medication Guides, or the 
means to produce Medication Guides, must provide the Medication 
Guides or the means to provide them to authorized dispensers. 42  Chapter Two
• Each authorized dispenser of a prescription drug product for which 
a Medication Guide is required must provide the Medication Guide 
directly to each patient or each patient’s agent when the product is 
dispensed, unless an exemption applies.
Sections 208.3(a) and (b) contain the following definitions: 
• Authorized dispenser is “an individual licensed, registered, or 
otherwise permitted by the jurisdiction in which the individual 
practices to provide drug products on prescription in the course of 
professional practice.” 
• Dispense to patients means the “act of delivering a prescription 
drug to a patient or an agent of the patient either: 
– (1) By a licensed practitioner or an agent of a licensed 
practitioner, either directly or indirectly, for self-administration 
by the patient, or the patient’s agent, or outside the licensed 
practitioner’s direct supervision; or 
– (2) By an authorized dispenser or an agent of an authorized 
dispenser under a lawful prescription of a licensed practitioner.”
Between March 25, 2008, when the REMS provisions of FDAAA took 
effect, and January 1, 2011, FDA approved more than 150 Medication 
Guides for products approved under new drug applications (NDAs) and 
biologic license applications (BLAs) as part of a REMS. One hundred and 
eight of these REMSs included only a Medication Guide and a timetable 
for submission of assessments of the REMS. In some cases, Medication 
Guides have been approved as part of a REMS for drugs that are often 
provided in inpatient settings or in outpatient settings where the drug is 
dispensed to a healthcare professional who then administers the drug to 
the patient. Questions have arisen concerning FDA’s policy on whether 
the Medication Guide must be provided every time the drug is dispensed 
because part 208 states that the regulations are intended to apply primarily 
in the outpatient setting. As of December 31, 2023, there are 67 currently 
approved individual and shared system REMS.1
Risk Management Plans to Mitigate the 
Potential for Drug Shortages
In May 2022, FDA published a draft guidance for industry named “Risk 
Management Plans to Mitigate the Potential for Drug Shortages.” This 
guidance is intended to help stakeholders develop, maintain, and imple￾ment risk management plans (RMPs) to proactively assist in the prevention Current Initiatives  43
of human drug and biological products shortages. RMPs can provide 
stakeholders with a framework to proactively identify, prioritize, and imple￾ment strategies to mitigate hazards that can cause a supply disruption. Such 
a supply disruption may lead to a drug shortage. Effective quality risk man￾agement can facilitate better, more informed decisions; provide FDA with 
greater assurance that stakeholders understand and can manage the asso￾ciated risks; and potentially affect the extent and level of direct regulatory 
oversight. Based on recent publications and reports, the majority of drug 
shortages are associated with quality issues. This guidance describes a 
framework for stakeholders to consider when developing RMPs that aligns 
with principles stated in the International Council for Harmonization 
(ICH) guidance for industry Q9 Quality Risk Management (first adopted 
2006). In addition, FDA also recommends risk factors to consider when 
developing the content of the RMPs.
FDA recognizes that drug shortages pose a significant public health 
threat because they can delay, and in some cases even deny, critically 
needed care for patients. Proactive risk assessment can enable stakeholders 
to predict and prevent supply disruptions that could potentially lead to a 
drug shortage.
In July 2012, with the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration 
Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), Congress empowered FDA with 
tools to work in collaboration with industry to help prevent or mitigate drug 
supply disruptions and drug shortages, and clarified cGMP requirements 
relevant to the oversight and controls over the manufacture of drugs to 
ensure quality. In 2011 and 2012, FDA assisted in mitigating 368 new drug 
shortages and preventing 473 drug shortages. In contrast, in the six-year 
span after FDASIA was enacted, FDA assisted in mitigating 222 new drug 
shortages and preventing 806 drug shortages. Although the number of new 
drug shortages has declined significantly since the peak in 2011, reaching a 
low in 2015 and 2016, this downward trend did not continue in subsequent 
years. Drug shortages continue to occur and at roughly the same levels 
since 2018.
Further, drug shortages have grown more persistent (for example, 
increased length of active drug shortages). Many of the reasons for drug 
shortages are, for example, issues related to drug quality, disruptions to 
supply chain manufacturing operations (for example, caused by natural 
disaster or discontinuation of components by suppliers), limitations in 
forecasting future demand, and market withdrawals of drug products. 
Additionally, in recent years, FDA has observed a rise in the number of 
cyberattacks on drug manufacturers and is increasingly concerned about 
the effect of such attacks on the drug supply chain.44  Chapter Two
In March 2020, with the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security Act (CARES Act), U.S. Congress added section 506C(j) 
to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), which requires 
certain manufacturers to develop, maintain, and implement, as appropriate, 
a “redundancy risk management plan that identifies and evaluates risks to 
the supply of the drug, as applicable, for each establishment in which such 
drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient of such drug is manufactured.” 
Section 506C(j) became effective on September 23, 2020.
MEDICAL DEVICES
Risk management is an integral part of any medical device’s life cycle 
because it details the hazards and risks linked to the use of the device. 
It also describes how manufacturers handled those hazards and risks to 
optimize its safety and performance. Typically, manufacturers created the 
risk management file of each device by continuously analyzing the risk of 
the device throughout the design and development processes.
One of the most significant factors associated with safe and effective 
medical devices is the identification of risks and the application of risk 
management tools to control them. To ensure that medical devices are safe 
and effective, risk management is a regulatory requirement worldwide. U.S. 
FDA mandates it in the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR Part 820). 
Europe requires it in the Medical Device Regulation (2017/745) and the In 
Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulation (2017/746). Canada Medical Devices 
Regulations (SOR/98-282) categorizes devices into four classes based 
on the risk. All countries have some requirement for risk management 
referenced in their national regulations and/or ISO 13485:2016.
Current versions of two important medical devices’ international 
standards are discussed below: ISO 13485:2016 and ISO 14971:2019. 
ISO 13485:2016 Risk Requirements 
ISO 13485, Medical devices—Quality management systems—Require￾ments for regulatory purposes, is an international standard that specifies 
the requirements for a quality management system specific to the medical 
devices industry. It was revised in March 2016. The new version has a 
greater emphasis on risk management and risk-based decision-making, 
as well as changes related to the increased regulatory requirements for 
organizations in the supply chain.
There are many elements of risk-based thinking in the ISO 13485:2016 
international standard that may affect organizations as they work toward Current Initiatives  45
compliance to the standard. The following excerpts and summaries describe
references to risk in this international standard.
Under Section 0.2, Clarification of concepts, the standard establishes 
that when a requirement is qualified by the phrase “as appropriate,” it is 
deemed to be appropriate unless the organization can justify otherwise. A 
requirement is considered appropriate if it is necessary for the organization 
to manage risks. It also states that “when the term ‘risk’ is used, the appli￾cation of the term within the scope of this International Standard pertains 
to safety or performance requirements of the medical device or meeting 
applicable regulatory requirements.”
Under Section 3, Terms and Definitions, it describes risk as a “com￾bination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that 
harm” and risk management as “systematic application of management 
policies, procedures and practices to the tasks of analyzing, evaluating, 
controlling and monitoring risk.”
Under Section 4, Quality management system, Subsection 4.1, General 
requirements, Subsection 4.1.2, “The organization shall apply a risk-based 
approach to the control of the appropriate processes needed for the quality 
management system,” and under Subsection 4.1.5, “When the organization 
chooses to outsource any process that affects product conformity to 
requirements, it shall monitor and ensure control over such processes. The 
organization shall retain responsibility of conformity to this International 
Standard and to customer and applicable regulatory requirements for out￾sourced processes. The controls shall be proportionate to the risk involved 
and the ability of the external party to meet the requirements in accordance 
with 7.4. The controls shall include written quality agreements.”
Under Subsection 4.1.6, it establishes that “The specific approach and 
activities associated with software validation and revalidation shall be 
proportionate to the risk associated with the use of the software.”
Under Section 6, Resource management, Subsection 6.2, Human 
resources, a Note establishes that “The methodology used to check effec￾tiveness is proportionate to the risk associated with the work for which the 
training or other action is being provided.”
Under Section 7, Product realization, Subsection 7.1, Planning of 
product realization, it establishes that “The organization shall document 
one or more processes for risk management in product realization. Records 
of risk management activities shall be maintained.”
Under Subsection 7.3.3, Design and development inputs, it establishes 
that “Inputs relating to product requirements shall be determined and 
records maintained (see 4.2.5). These inputs shall include applicable 
output(s) of risk management.” 46  Chapter Two
Under Subsection 7.3.9, Control of design and development changes, 
it establishes that “The review of design and development changes shall 
include evaluation of the effect of the changes on constituent parts 
and product in process or already delivered, inputs or outputs of risk 
management and product realization processes.”
Under Section 7.4, Purchasing, Subsection 7.4.1, Purchasing process, 
it establishes that “The organization shall establish criteria for the 
evaluation and selection of suppliers. The criteria shall be proportionate 
to the risk associated with the medical device,” and it also states that 
“Non-fulfilment of purchasing requirements shall be addressed with the 
supplier proportionate to the risk associated with the purchased product 
and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.” 
Under Subsection 7.4.3, Verification of purchased product, it estab￾lishes that “The organization shall establish and implement the inspection 
or other activities necessary for ensuring that purchased product meets 
specified purchasing requirements. The extent of verification activities 
shall be based on the supplier evaluation results and proportionate to the 
risks associated with the purchased product.”
Under Subsection 7.5.6, Validation of processes for production and 
service provision, it establishes that “The specific approach and activities 
associated with software validation and revalidation shall be proportionate 
to the risk associated with the use of the software, including the effect on 
the ability of the product to conform to specifications.”
Under Section 7.6, Control of monitoring and measuring equipment, 
it establishes that “The specific approach and activities associated with 
software validation and revalidation shall be proportionate to the risk 
associated with the use of the software, including the effect on the ability 
of the product to conform to specifications.
Under Section 8.2, Monitoring and measurement, Subsection 8.2.1, 
Feedback, it establishes that “The information gathered in the feedback 
process shall serve as potential input into risk management for monitoring 
and maintaining the product requirements as well as the product realization 
or improvement processes.”
ISO 14971:2019
ISO 14971 is an international risk management standard for medical 
devices (including in vitro diagnostic medical devices). It defines a set of 
medical device risk management requirements. The purpose of ISO 14971 
is to help manufacturers establish a medical device risk management 
process that can be used to identify hazards, estimate and evaluate risks, Current Initiatives  47
and implement and monitor the effectiveness of risk control measures 
(ISO 2019a).
ISO 14971 was first published in 2000. The most recent edition is 
the third edition, which was published in December of 2019. ISO 14971 
was developed because no standard existed at the time, and regulators 
throughout the world wanted manufacturers to apply risk management to 
their medical devices. 
This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition 
(ISO 14971:2007), which was technically revised. The main changes com￾pared to the previous edition are as follows:
– A clause on normative references is included, it is copied from 
the Foreword.
– The defined terms are updated, and many are derived from 
ISO/IEC Guide 63:2019. Defined terms are printed in italics to 
assist the reader in identifying them in the body of the document.
– Definitions of benefit, reasonably foreseeable misuse, and state of 
the art are introduced.
– More attention is given to the benefits that are expected from the 
use of the medical device. The term benefit-risk analysis is aligned 
with the terminology used in some regulations.
– It is explained that the process described in ISO 14971 can be used 
for managing risks associated with medical devices, including those 
related to data and systems security.
– The method for evaluating the overall residual risk and the 
criteria for its acceptability are required to be defined in the risk 
management plan. The method can include gathering and reviewing 
data and literature for the medical device and for similar medical 
devices and other similar products on the market. The criteria for 
the acceptability of the overall residual risk can be different from 
the criteria for acceptability of individual risks.
– The requirements to disclose residual risks were moved and merged 
into one requirement, after the overall residual risk is evaluated and 
judged acceptable.
– The review before commercial distribution of the medical device 
concerns the execution of the risk management plan. The results of 
the review are documented as the risk management report.48  Chapter Two
– The requirements for production and post-production activities were 
clarified and restructured. More detail is given on the information 
to be collected and the actions to be taken when the collected 
information has been reviewed and determined to be relevant to 
safety.
– Several informative annexes were moved to the guidance in 
ISO/TR 24971:2020, which was revised in parallel. More 
information and a rationale for the requirements in this third 
edition of ISO 14971 are provided in Annex A. The correspondence 
between the clauses of the second edition and those of this third 
edition are given in Annex B.
ISO 14971:2019 specifies a process for a manufacturer to identify the 
hazards associated with medical devices, estimate and evaluate the 
associated risks, control these risks, and monitor the effectiveness of the 
controls. It applies to product design, production, and all post-production 
activities. Since risks can be introduced throughout the product life cycle 
and risks that emerge at one point can often be controlled at a completely 
different point, ISO 14971 must be used throughout the product’s existence.
However, ISO 14971 does not apply to clinical decision-making. 
Whether a medical device should be used in the context of a particular 
clinical procedure is a matter of judgment. Such judgments are usually 
made by qualified healthcare professionals and are not regulated by 
this international standard. The standard requires that top management 
demonstrate its commitment to risk management by:
• Establishing the process
• Setting the policy for acceptable risk
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the process at determined intervals
Medical device risk management is mandatory in most countries and 
regions of the world. Every regulated medical device manufacturer needs 
to be able to prove to regulators that it uses risk management methods to 
control risk and ensure that its products are safe. For example, ISO 14971 
is widely recognized as the official standard for medical device risk 
management. Regulators in most major markets expect medical device 
manufacturers to use this standard to manage risk. ISO 14971 has been 
officially recognized by the U.S. FDA and by Health Canada. In addition, 
the European Union has adopted it as a harmonized standard, and Australia 
and Japan have accepted it as the official standard for medical device risk 
management. ISO 14971 does not expect medical device manufacturers to 
become certified. Manufacturers can simply use the standard to manage Current Initiatives  49
risk and then declare that they are in compliance (if they can demonstrate 
that this is in fact true).
ISO 14971:2019 describes a risk management process (Parts 4 through 10) 
and is organized in the following way: 
Part 4. Establish a risk management framework.
Part 5. Perform a risk analysis for each medical device.
Part 6. Evaluate risk for each identified hazardous situation.
Part 7. Develop risk control measures when risk must be reduced.
Part 8. Evaluate the overall residual risk posed by each device.
Part 9. Review the risk management process and prepare a report.
Part 10. Monitor the device during production and post-production.
ISO 14971:2019 does not change the risk management process, but it 
finally defines the “benefits,” which the previous versions did not do. 
Benefit is now defined as: “Positive impact or desirable outcome of the use 
of a medical device on the health of an individual, or a positive impact on 
patient management or public health.”
ISO/TR 24971:2020. This technical report will assist manufacturers in 
the development, implementation, and maintenance of a risk management 
process for medical devices that aims to meet the requirements of ISO 
14971:2019. It provides guidance on the application of ISO 14971:2019 for 
a wide variety of medical devices. These medical devices include active, 
nonactive, implantable, and nonimplantable medical devices; software as 
medical devices; and in vitro diagnostic medical devices.
The clauses and subclauses in this document have the same structure 
and numbering as the clauses and subclauses of ISO 14971:2019 to facilitate 
the use of this guidance in applying the requirements of the standard. 
Further division into subclauses is applied where considered useful. The 
informative annexes contain additional guidance on specific aspects of risk 
management. 
Annex H was prepared in cooperation with Technical Committee 
ISO/TC 212, Clinical laboratory testing and in vitro diagnostic test systems.
This document describes approaches that manufacturers can use to 
develop, implement, and maintain a risk management process conforming 
to ISO 14971:2019. Alternative approaches can also satisfy the requirements 
of ISO 14971:2019.
ISO 14971 and FDA. FDA recognized ISO 14971:2019 as an acceptable 
risk management model under Recognition Number 5-125 dated Decem￾ber 23, 2019.50  Chapter Two
GHTF/IMDRF Guidelines
The Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) was a voluntary group 
of representatives from national medical device regulatory authorities 
(such as the U.S. FDA) and the members of the medical device industry 
whose goal was the standardization of medical device regulation across 
the world. The representatives from its five founding members (the 
European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia) were 
divided into three geographical areas: Europe, Asia-Pacific, and North 
America. Each of these actively regulates medical devices using its own 
unique regulatory framework. Founded in 1992, the GHTF was created 
by EU, U.S., Japanese, Australian, and Canadian regulatory and industry 
officials to respond to the growing need for international harmonization in 
the regulation of medical devices. In November 2012, the global medical 
device harmonization body ceased its activities, leaving its unfinished 
work to the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), a 
successor organization comprising officials from regulatory agencies—not 
industry—around the world. The organization had been a mainstay within 
the regulatory harmonization movement.
GHTF guideline SG3/N15R8 “Implementation of Risk Management 
Principles and Activities within a Quality Management System” was 
released in May 2005 (http://www.imdrf.org). This document is intended to 
assist medical device manufacturers with the integration of a risk manage￾ment system or risk management principles and activities into their existing 
QMS by providing practical explanations and examples. Medical device 
manufacturers are generally required to have a QMS as well as processes 
for addressing device-related risks. These processes for managing risk 
can evolve into a stand-alone management system. While manufacturers 
may choose to maintain these two management systems separately, it may 
be advantageous to integrate them, as it could reduce costs, eliminate 
redundancies, and lead to a more effective management system.
A basic understanding of QMS requirements and a basic knowledge 
of quality management system terminology are assumed in this guidance 
document. This document is based on general principles of a QMS and 
general principles of a risk management system. This document also:
• Has general applicability to QMSs for manufacturers providing 
medical devices
• Discusses risk management related to medical device safety, rather 
than financial or other business risks
• Does not suggest a particular method of implementation Current Initiatives  51
• Does not include requirements to be used as the basis of regulatory 
inspection or certification assessment activities
The scope of the medical device manufacturer’s QMS will define the 
applicability and extent of implementing risk management principles and 
activities. Processes required by the QMS and performed by suppliers to the 
manufacturer are the responsibility of the manufacturer. Risk management 
activities relating to any process within the QMS are ultimately the 
responsibility of the manufacturer.
An effective QMS is essential for ensuring the safety and performance 
of medical devices. A well-defined QMS includes safety considerations in 
specific areas. Given the importance of safety, it is useful to identify some 
key activities that specifically address safety issues and ensure appropriate 
input and feedback from these activities into the QMS. The degree to 
which safety considerations are addressed should be commensurate with 
the degree of the risk and the nature of the device. 
Risk management principles should be applied throughout the life 
cycle of medical devices and used to identify and address safety issues. In 
general, risk management can be characterized by phases of activities. The 
following discussion is one example of how these phases can be described:
a. The first phase can be the determination of levels of risk that 
would be acceptable in the device. Manufacturers should have 
a procedure or policy to determine risk acceptability criteria. 
These risk acceptability criteria may come from an analysis of 
the manufacturer’s own experience with similar medical devices 
or research on what appear to be currently accepted risk levels 
by regulators, users, or patients, given the benefits derived from 
diagnosis or treatment with the device. Risk acceptability 
criteria generally should be reflective of the state of the art in 
controlling risks.
b. The second phase can be risk analysis. This phase starts with 
identifying hazards that may occur due to characteristics or 
properties of the device during normal use or foreseeable misuse. 
After hazards are identified, risks are estimated for each of the 
identified hazards, using available information.
c. In the third phase, the estimated risks are compared to the 
risk acceptability criteria. This comparison will determine an 
appropriate level of risk reduction, if necessary. This is called risk 
evaluation. The combination of risk analysis and risk evaluation is 
called risk assessment.52  Chapter Two
d. The fourth phase can be composed of risk control and monitoring 
activities. The manufacturer establishes actions (risk control 
measures) intended to eliminate or reduce each risk to meet the 
previously determined risk acceptability criteria. Within the 
limits of feasibility, one or more risk control measures may be 
incorporated in order to achieve this end. Risk control activities 
may begin as early as design input and continue through the 
design and development process, manufacturing, distribution, 
installation, and servicing, and throughout the medical device 
life cycle.
Some regulatory schemes prescribe a fixed hierarchy of risk control 
measures that should be examined in the following order:
1. Inherent safety by design
2. Protective measures in the device or its manufacture
3. Information for safety, such as warnings, and so on
Throughout the life cycle of the device, the manufacturer monitors whether 
the risks continue to remain acceptable and whether any new hazards or 
risks are discovered. Information typically obtained from the QMS—
for example, production, complaints, customer feedback—should be 
used as part of this monitoring. If, at any time, a risk is determined to be 
unacceptable, the existing risk analysis should be reexamined and appro￾priate action should be taken to meet the risk acceptability criteria. If a 
new hazard is identified, the four phases of risk management should be 
performed. 
FDA has recognized three classes of medical devices based on the 
level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the 
device (see Table 2.1). The classification procedures are described in 
the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, part 860 (usually known as 21 
CFR 860). 
Non–U.S. Regulations
As a direct example of how some countries apply risk management criteria 
to regulate medical products, I can mention the Canadian Guidance on 
Risk Classification of Medical Device Observations (GUI-0079) imple￾mented October 1, 2010 (currently version 3, issued December 2022). 
The purpose of this guidance is to classify the observations noted during 
inspections at medical device establishments under the Medical Devices 
Inspection Program according to their risk (Health Canada 2022).Current Initiatives  53
Class III
General controls and
pre-market approval
A Class III device
is one for which
insufficient information
exists to assure safety
and effectiveness solely 
through the general or
special controls 
sufficient for Class I or
Class II devices. Such a 
device needs pre-market
approval, a scientific 
review to ensure the 
device’s safety and 
effectiveness, in
addition to the 
general controls of
Class I. Class III devices 
are usually those that
support or sustain
human life, are of 
substantial importance
in preventing impair￾ment of human health, 
or that present a 
potential, unreason￾able risk of illness 
or injury.
Examples: implantable 
pacemaker, pulse 
generators, HIV 
diagnostic tests, and 
automated external
defibrillators
Class II
General controls with
special controls
Class II devices are 
those for which general
controls alone are 
insufficient to assure
safety and effective￾ness, and existing
methods are available 
to provide such
assurances. In addition
to complying with 
general controls, Class II 
devices are also subject
to special controls.
A few Class II devices 
are exempt from the 
pre-market notification. 
Special controls may 
include special labeling 
requirements, manda￾tory performance 
standards, and post￾market surveillance.
Devices in Class II are 
held to a higher level 
of assurance than
Class I devices, and 
are designed to perform 
as indicated without 
causing injury or harm
to patient or user.
Examples: powered 
wheelchairs, infusion
pumps, and surgical 
drapes
Class I
General controls
Class I devices are 
subject to the least 
regulatory control.
General controls
include provisions that
relate to adulteration;
misbranding; device
registration and listing; 
pre-market notification; 
banned devices;
notification, including
repair, replacement, or
refund; records and 
reports; restricted
devices; and current 
good manufacturing 
practices (cGMP).
Class I devices are not 
intended for use in
supporting or sustaining 
life or to be of substan￾tial importance in
preventing impairment
to human health, and 
they may not present a 
potential unreasonable
risk of illness or injury.
Most Class I devices 
are exempt from the 
pre-market notification
and/or good manufac￾turing practices 
regulation.
Examples: elastic 
bandages, examination 
gloves, and handheld
surgical instruments
Table 2.1 FDA medical device classification.54  Chapter Two
Its scope is to ensure uniformity among the inspectors in the attribution 
of the overall establishment rating following establishment inspections, 
and to inform the industry of situations that the inspectorate considers 
unacceptable and that will generate a noncompliant rating following an 
inspection.
This guidance explains the risk classification assigned to observations 
made during inspections of medical device manufacturers, importers, and/
or distributors. The risk classification of an observation is determined 
by the inspector through the use of this document and other relevant 
documents and information, and considers the compliance history of the 
establishment and the real and/or potential risk involved.
Inspection Ratings and Observations Classifications
Table 2.2 describes the possible outcomes of inspections under Canadian 
regulation.
Noncompliant
At the time of the inspection, the 
regulated party has not demonstrated
that the activities it conducts are in
compliance with the Food and Drugs 
Act and its associated Regulations.
Compliant
At the time of the inspection, the 
regulated party has demonstrated
that the activities it conducts are in
compliance with the Food and Drugs
Act and its associated Regulations. 
A compliant rating does not mean
that there are no observations or
corrective actions required.
Table 2.2 Canadian medical device inspection classification.
Observations are classified as risk 1, 2, or 3, where risk 1 represents 
the greatest risk based on criteria such as health risks and deviation from 
regulations (see Table 2.3).
Another area where risk management is widely used is the classifi￾cation of medical product: prescription or nonprescription status for drugs, 
or how regulatory authorities recognize different classes of medical devices 
based on their design complexity, their use characteristics, and their 
potential for harm if misused. Each country or region defines these cate￾gories in different ways. The authorities also recognize that some devices 
are provided in combination with drugs, and regulation of these combina￾tion products takes this factor into consideration.Current Initiatives  55
Risk 3
An observation that
is neither Risk 1 nor
Risk 2, but is related 
to a deviation from the 
Act or the Regulations
Risk 2
An observation 
related to the failure
of an establishment to
meet the requirements 
of the Act and the 
Regulations related 
to the processing, 
importation, and/or
distribution of medical 
devices, or a situation in
which the probability of
an immediate health risk
is remote because
procedures are in place 
to mitigate the risk
Risk 1
An observation
describing a situation
that has resulted, or has 
the potential to result in
an immediate or latent 
health risk, and may
include any observation
that involves fraud,
misrepresentation, or
falsification of medical 
devices or records
Table 2.3 Canadian medical device risk classification.
Classification of Medical Devices in Canada and the European 
Union. The Medical Devices Bureau of Health Canada has recognized 
four classes of medical devices based on the level of control necessary to 
assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices present the 
lowest potential risk and do not require a license. Class II devices require 
the manufacturer’s declaration of device safety and effectiveness, whereas 
Class III and IV devices present a greater potential risk and are subject to 
in-depth scrutiny. 
Canadian classes of medical devices generally correspond to the 
Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 devices as follows: Class 
IV (Canada) generally corresponds to Class III (EU), Class III (Canada) 
generally corresponds to Class IIb (EU), Class II (Canada) generally corre￾sponds to Class IIa (EU), and Class I (Canada) generally corresponds to 
Class I (EU). Examples are surgical instruments (Class I); contact lenses, 
ultrasound scanners (Class II); orthopedic implants, hemodialysis machines 
(Class III); and cardiac pacemakers (Class IV). 
The EU has four classes of medical devices that generally correspond 
to Canada’s four classes, as illustrated in Table 2.4. The classification of 
medical devices in the European Union is outlined in Medical Devices 
Regulation (2017/745). There are basically four classes, ranging from low 
risk to high risk: Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb, and Class III. The European 
IVD regulation (2017/746) has a similar classification system, from 
Class A (the lowest risk) to Class D (the highest risk).56  Chapter Two

Table 2.4 Comparison of Canadian and European medical device
classification.
The authorization of medical devices in the European Union is 
guaranteed by a EU MDR Declaration of Conformity. This declaration is 
issued by the manufacturer itself; medical devices that pertain to Class I 
(on condition they do not need to be sterilized or are not used to measure a 
function) can be put on the market purely by self-certification.2
 All others 
must be verified by a Certificate of Conformity issued by a Notified Body.
The European classification depends on rules that involve the medical 
device’s duration of body contact, its invasive character, its use of an energy 
source, its effect on the central circulation or nervous system, its diagnostic 
impact, or its incorporation of a medicinal product.
FOOD SAFETY
Food safety is a scientific discipline describing handling, preparation, and 
storage of food in ways that prevent foodborne illness. This includes several 
activities that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards. 
Foodborne diseases take a major toll on health. Millions of people fall ill 
and many die because of eating unsafe food. Deeply concerned by this, 
World Health Organization (WHO) member states adopted a resolution in 
2000 to recognize food safety as an essential public health function.
Food safety encompasses actions aimed at ensuring that all food is 
as safe as possible. Food safety policies and actions need to cover the 
entire food chain, from production to consumption. Unsafe food poses 
global health threats, endangering everyone, especially those particularly 
vulnerable (the elderly, infants, pregnant woman, and so on). For example, 
every year 220 million children contract diarrheal diseases and 96,000 die 
(World Health Organization 2015).
In 2002, FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) 
recommended the following:
Risk analysis is a powerful tool that should be used to enhance 
the scientific basis of regulatory decisions. It should be conducted 
within CFSAN through the efforts of risk assessment, risk man-Current Initiatives  57
agement, and risk communication teams. Risk assessment should 
be conducted in an iterative manner that allows refinement of the 
risk assessment question(s), key assumptions, and data used in the 
model. The exchange of information (communication) within and 
between the risk analysis teams, with other agencies, and stake￾holders (including industry, consumer groups, and other interested 
parties) should be encouraged by active participation in the 
process and collaboration, when appropriate.
To support and promote the use of a risk analysis framework for 
initiating and conducting ‘major’ risk assessments, CFSAN should:
1. Adopt a decision-based approach to identify and select 
risk assessments conducted by CFSAN, particularly 
those that are ‘major’ (complex and impact or involve 
multiple offices). Available resources, regulatory needs, 
and public health concerns should be considered in the 
selection of risk assessments. This approach should 
be implemented for microbial risk assessments now, 
and later expanded to include chemical and other non￾microbial hazards.
2. Establish a procedure for the conduct of risk assessment 
within a risk analysis framework. The procedure should 
identify the boundaries and responsibilities of key 
participants in the risk analysis process.
3. Develop criteria to evaluate the quality of data used for 
risk assessments and specify what information is needed 
to scientifically evaluate the usefulness of a study or data 
set used for risk assessment.
4. Develop guidelines to evaluate risk assessments and 
supporting data developed by stakeholders and submitted 
to the Center.
5. Formalize a peer review process that will encourage 
critical review and evaluation of CFSAN’s risk 
assessments by government and non-government experts 
in a manner that improves the science and acceptance of 
complex risk assessments.
6. Build capacity to conduct complex risk assessments by 
providing training opportunities for current staff, hiring 
new staff or using contractors (as needed), and acquiring 
additional resources such as computers, software, and 
dedicated workspace.58  Chapter Two
ISO 22000:2018 and Hazard Analysis and 
Critical Control Points (HACCP)
The launch on September 1, 2005, of the ISO 22000 (Food safety 
management) series, developed by ISO technical committee ISO/TC 34, 
Food Products, signaled the arrival of a truly global option for ensuring 
safe food supply chains. ISO 22000:2018 (second edition issued June 2018) 
is an international standard that defines the requirements of a food safety 
management system covering all organizations in the food chain from 
“farm to fork.” ISO 22000:2018 specifies requirements for a food safety 
management system where an organization in the food chain (including 
interrelated organizations such as producers of equipment, packaging 
materials, cleaning agents, additives, and ingredients) needs to demonstrate 
its ability to control food safety hazards to ensure that food is safe at the 
time of human consumption (ISO 2018a). The standard combines generally 
recognized key elements to ensure food safety along the food chain, 
including:
• Interactive communication
• System management
• Control of food safety hazards through prerequisite programs and 
HACCP plans
• Continual improvement and updating of the food safety 
management system
The most effective food safety systems are established, operated, and 
updated within the framework of a structured management system and 
incorporated into the overall management activities of the organization. 
This provides maximum benefit for the organization and interested 
parties. ISO 22000 has been aligned with ISO 9001 in order to enhance 
the compatibility of the two standards. ISO developed additional standards 
that are related to ISO 22000. These standards are known as the ISO 
22000 family of standards. Figure 2.1 depicts the current composition of 
this family of standards, each focusing on different aspects of food safety 
management.
ISO 22000:2018 major changes include modifications to its structure 
and clarification of key concepts such as:
• The high-level structure. To make life easier for businesses using 
more than one management system standard, the new version of 
ISO 22000 now follows the same structure as all the other ISO 
management system standards, the high-level structure (HLS).Current Initiatives  59
• ISO 22000:2018 contains the overall guidelines for food safety management. 
• ISO 22005:2007 focuses on traceability in the feed and food chain.
• ISO/TS 22002-1:2009 contains specific prerequisites for food manufacturing.
• ISO/TS 22002-2:2013 contains specific prerequisites for catering.
• ISO/TS 22002-3:2011 contains specific prerequisites for farming.
• ISO/TS 22002-4:2013 contains specific prerequisites for food packaging
manufacturing.
• ISO/TS 22002-5:2019 contains specific prerequisites for food transport
and storage.
• ISO/TS 22002-6:2016 contains specific prerequisites for feed and animal 
food production. 
• ISO/TS 22003:2022 provides guidelines for audit and certification bodies.
Figure 2.1 ISO 22000 family of standards.
• The risk approach. The standard now includes a different approach 
to understanding risk.
• The PDCA cycle. The standard clarifies the plan–do–check–
act (PDCA) cycle by having two separate cycles in the standard 
working together: one covering the management system and the 
other covering the principles of HACCP.
• The operation process. A clear description is given of the 
differences between key terms such as: critical control points 
(CCPs), operational prerequisite programs (OPRPs), and 
prerequisite programs (PRPs). 
Additional new concepts were introduced in ISO 22000:2018: 
• The concept of the process approach was made explicit.
• The PDCA cycle is now introduced at two levels: organizational 
and operational.
• The scope was widened to include food for animals (food is 
intended for consumption by humans and animals and includes 
feed and animal food; feed is intended to be fed to food-producing 
animals; animal food is intended to be fed to non-food-producing 
animals, such as pets).
• The term “product” was defined and clarified to include service.
• New terms were defined, such as “acceptable level,” “action 
criterion,” and “significant food safety hazard.”60  Chapter Two
• Some definitions were revised and improved, for example “control 
measure,” “critical control point (CCP),” “operational prerequisite 
program (OPRP),” and “prerequisite program (PRP).”
• The understanding of interested parties needs and expectations was 
introduced.
• The leadership role of the top management (commitment, 
responsibilities, and authorities) was strengthened.
• The use and control of the externally developed elements of the 
food safety management program were clarified.
• The concept of documented information was introduced.
• The concept of a hazard control plan was introduced.
ISO 22000 integrates the principles of the HACCP system and applica￾tion steps developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. By means 
of auditable requirements, it combines the HACCP plan with prerequi￾site programs. Hazard analysis is the key to an effective food safety 
management system, since conducting a hazard analysis assists in organiz￾ing the knowledge required to establish an effective combination of control 
measures. ISO 22000 requires that all hazards that may be reasonably 
expected to occur in the food chain, including hazards that may be asso￾ciated with the type of process and facilities used, are identified and 
assessed. Thus, it provides the means to determine and document why 
certain identified hazards need to be controlled by a particular organization 
and why others do not.
During hazard analysis, the organization determines the strategy to be 
used to ensure hazard control by combining the prerequisite programs and 
the HACCP plan. HACCP is a management system in which food safety 
is addressed through the analysis and control of biological, chemical, and 
physical hazards from raw material production, procurement, and handling, 
to manufacturing, distribution, and consumption of the finished product. 
A HACCP system helps you focus on the hazards that affect food safety 
through hazard identification and establish critical control limits at critical 
points during the production process.
HACCP is a systematic approach to the identification, evaluation, and 
control of food safety hazards based on the following seven principles:
Principle 1: Conduct a hazard analysis
Principle 2: Determine the CCPs
Principle 3: Establish critical limits
Principle 4: Establish monitoring proceduresCurrent Initiatives  61
Principle 5: Establish corrective actions
Principle 6: Establish verification procedures
Principle 7: Establish record-keeping and documentation 
procedures
A more detailed description of HACCP is included in Chapter 6.
FDA Food Safety Modernization Act: Risk-based 
Food Safety Prevention
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), the most important 
reform of U.S. food safety laws in more than 70 years, was signed into law 
by President Obama on January 4, 2011 It aims to ensure that the U.S. food 
supply is safe by shifting the focus from responding to contamination to 
preventing it. 
Prevention as the Cornerstone of the FDA Food Safety Moderni￾zation Act. About 48 million people (one in six Americans) get sick, 
128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die each year from foodborne diseases, 
per recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
This is a significant public health burden that is largely preventable.
The FSMA enables FDA to better protect public health by 
strengthening the food safety system. It enables FDA to focus more on 
preventing food safety problems rather than relying primarily on reacting 
to problems after they occur. Building a new food safety system based on 
prevention will take time, and FDA is creating a process for getting this 
work done. Congress has established specific implementation dates in the 
legislation. The funding the Agency gets each year, which affects staffing 
and vital operations, will affect how quickly FDA can put this legislation 
into effect. FDA is committed to implementing the requirements through 
an open process with opportunity for input from all stakeholders.
The following are among FDA’s key new prevention authorities and 
mandates. For the first time, FDA will have a legislative mandate to require 
comprehensive, science-based preventive controls across the food supply. 
This mandate includes:
• Mandatory preventive controls for food facilities. Food facilities 
are required to implement a written preventive controls plan. 
This involves: 
1. Evaluating the hazards that could affect food safety and 
specifying what preventive steps, or controls, will be put in place 
to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards 62  Chapter Two
2. Specifying how the facility will monitor these controls to ensure 
they are working
3. Maintaining routine records of the monitoring 
4. Specifying what actions the facility will take to correct 
problems that arise 
• Mandatory produce safety standards. FDA must establish science￾based, minimum standards for the safe production and harvesting 
of fruits and vegetables. Those standards must consider naturally 
occurring hazards, as well as those that may be introduced either 
unintentionally or intentionally, and must address soil amendments 
(materials added to the soil such as compost), hygiene, packaging, 
temperature controls, animals in the growing area, and water. 
• Authority to prevent intentional contamination. FDA must issue 
regulations to protect against the intentional adulteration of 
food, including the establishment of science-based mitigation 
strategies to prepare and protect the food supply chain at specific 
vulnerable points. 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Preventive Controls for 
Human Food rule is now final, and compliance dates for some businesses 
began in September 2016. This final rule is the product of an unprece￾dented level of outreach by FDA to industry; consumer groups; the agency’s 
federal, state, local, and tribal regulatory counterparts; academia; and 
other stakeholders. This outreach began before the rule was proposed in 
January 2013.
In response to input received during the comment period and during 
hundreds of engagements that included public meetings, webinars, listening 
sessions, and visits to farms and food facilities across the country, FDA 
issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in September 2014. 
The proposed revisions were designed to make the originally proposed rule 
more practical, flexible, and effective for industry, while still advancing 
FDA’s food safety goals.
The final rule has elements of both the original and supplemental 
proposals, in addition to new requirements that are the outgrowth of 
public input received during the comment period for both proposals. For 
example, flexibility was built into key requirements, including control 
of the supply chain, and the definition of farms—which are exempt from 
these regulations—was significantly changed to reflect modern farming 
practices.Current Initiatives  63
Key Requirements. Covered facilities must establish and implement a 
food safety system that includes an analysis of hazards and risk-based pre￾ventive controls. The rule sets requirements for a written food safety plan 
that includes:
• Hazard analysis. The first step is hazard identification, which must 
consider known or reasonably foreseeable biological, chemical, 
and physical hazards. These hazards could be present because they 
occur naturally, are unintentionally introduced, or are intentionally 
introduced for economic gain (if they affect the safety of the food).
• Preventive controls. These measures are required to ensure that 
hazards requiring a preventive control will be minimized or 
prevented. They include process, food allergen, and sanitation 
controls, as well as supply chain controls and a recall plan.
• Oversight and management of preventive controls. The final rule 
provides flexibility in the steps needed to ensure that preventive 
controls are effective and to correct problems that may arise. 
• Monitoring. These procedures are designed to provide assurance 
that preventive controls are consistently performed. Monitoring is 
conducted as appropriate to the preventive control. For example, 
monitoring of a heat process to kill pathogens would include actual 
temperature values and be more frequent than the monitoring of 
preventive maintenance activities used to minimize metal hazards, 
which could be a simple record of the date on which the activity 
took place.
• Corrective actions and corrections. Corrections are steps taken to 
timely identify and correct a minor, isolated problem that occurs 
during food production. Corrective actions include actions to 
identify a problem with preventive control implementation, reduce 
the likelihood the problem will reoccur, evaluate affected food for 
safety, and prevent it from entering commerce. Corrective actions 
must be documented with records.
• Verification. These activities are required to ensure that preventive 
controls are consistently implemented and effective. They include 
validating with scientific evidence that a preventive control is 
capable of effectively controlling an identified hazard; calibration 
(or accuracy checks) of process monitoring and verification 
instruments such as thermometers; and reviewing records to verify 
that monitoring and corrective actions (if necessary) are being 
conducted. Product testing and environmental monitoring are 64  Chapter Two
possible verification activities but are only required as appropriate 
to the food, facility, nature of the preventive control, and role of 
that control in the facility’s food safety system. Environmental 
monitoring generally would be required if contamination of a 
ready-to-eat food with an environmental pathogen is a hazard 
requiring a preventive control.
• Current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs). These were 
updated and clarified. Among the more significant changes are the 
following:
– The final rule does not include nonbinding provisions, which are 
more appropriate for guidance.
– Some of the previously nonbinding provisions, such as education 
and training, are now binding. 
– Management is required to ensure that all employees who 
manufacture, process, pack, or hold food are qualified to perform 
their assigned duties.
– Such employees must have the necessary combination of 
education, training, and/or experience necessary to manufacture, 
process, pack, or hold clean and safe food. Individuals must 
receive training in the principles of food hygiene and food safety, 
including the importance of employee health and hygiene. 
– FDA’s long-standing position that cGMPs address allergen cross￾contact is now explicit in the regulatory text.
Supply Chain: Risk Consideration for 
Regulated Products
Globalization presents serious challenges to the ability of the U.S. medical 
product safety system to protect American families. Among these chal￾lenges are the growth in the number of medical products produced abroad, 
the increasingly complex path that medical products travel from source 
materials to consumers, and the greater chance for the intentional substi￾tution of ingredients for profit (economic adulteration). 
FDA is implementing a comprehensive approach to medical product 
safety along the supply chain, like its approach to food safety. The goal 
of these efforts is to protect Americans from contamination, diversion, 
counterfeiting, and other risks that could harm patients. In FDA’s fiscal 
year (FY) 2009 appropriation, Congress directed FDA “to prepare and 
provide to the Committees on Appropriations a comprehensive approach Current Initiatives  65
to ensuring the safety of medical products from the manufacturing of 
raw ingredients or components to consumer use.” The response to this 
congressional inquiry was the Report on FDA’s Approach to Medical 
Product Supply Chain Safety presented July 14, 2009.
For the purposes of this report, medical products include human 
drugs, biologics, and medical devices, but not special dietary products, 
medicated feeds, veterinary drugs, or radiation-emitting products that 
are not otherwise medical devices. Other reports on medical product 
safety underscore the importance of FDA’s supply chain safety efforts. 
In December 2007, FDA’s Science Board Subcommittee on Science and 
Technology issued a report concluding that FDA was not positioned to meet 
the demands of its regulatory responsibilities considering the challenges 
of regulating globalized industries and the need to manage new science 
and technologies. The 2007 report recommended that FDA strengthen its 
collaboration with other government agencies to improve medical product 
safety programs. A supplemental report, issued in May 2008 by the Science 
Board Subcommittee of the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), contained 
similar findings and recommended that FDA conduct more domestic 
and foreign inspections coupled with certification programs for foreign 
manufacturers, greater inspection by foreign regulatory authorities, and 
improved risk-management inspection procedures. FDA has incorporated 
these approaches into its supply chain safety initiative.
Supply chain safety refers to minimizing risks that arise anywhere 
along the supply chain continuum, from sourcing a product’s raw 
materials, ingredients, and components through the product’s manufacture, 
importation, sale, and distribution. Although FDA has a significant number 
of efforts under way that address medical product safety issues beyond the 
supply chain, addressing supply chain safety presents some of the greatest 
challenges. This report identifies trends and challenges that FDA faces all 
along the supply chain. To address them and protect public health, FDA has 
adopted four primary strategies: 
1. Focus on prevention
2. Enhance regulatory information 
3. Improve FDA’s scientific and analytic capabilities 
4. Expand risk-based inspection and enforcement 
The report describes these four strategies and the steps that FDA is taking 
to implement them. The report concluded that: 
Providing patients with safe and effective medical products is a 
vital part of FDA’s mission to protect and promote the public health. 66  Chapter Two
FDA is committed to implementing a modern medical 
product safety system that focuses on prevention, provides 
enhanced regulatory information to FDA, is supported by 
improved FDA scientific and analytic capabilities, and expands 
risk-based inspections and enforcement. FDA has already taken 
many steps in furtherance of its comprehensive approach to 
improving medical product safety; we have implemented a wide 
range of new initiatives and instituted policies that are aimed at 
making sure that American consumers receive only safe medical 
products. 
At the same time, FDA recognizes that its approach must 
continue to evolve and remain flexible, as challenges to the medi￾cal product supply chain will also continue to evolve. 
Although we have made significant progress, much remains. 
We look forward to working with Congress and our other partners 
on additional ways to maintain a modern safety system so that 
Americans have the safe and effective medical products they 
rightly deserve.
FDA also identified as part of the report the following areas of opportunity 
to increase safety of the medical products supply chain:
• Increase foreign and domestic medical product inspections and 
other field activities conducted by ORA 
• Improve laboratory infrastructure to increase the volume of 
sample analysis 
• Provide technical support to FDA foreign offices and field 
operations conducting foreign and domestic device manufacturing 
inspections 
• Provide on-site training to foreign regulators on medical device 
safety and quality standards 
• Create and translate computerized training classes on medical 
device safety and quality standards into several languages
• Verify registration of medical device establishments 
• Develop and issue regulations on a unique device identification 
system 
• Increase technical support for foreign and domestic inspections and 
enhance risk analysis tools for biologic products Current Initiatives  67
• Develop quality systems for product testing and lot release of 
biological products 
• Strengthen science and computing to ensure that FDA can 
adequately regulate new drug manufacturing technologies 
• Identify and improve enforcement against internet sites that expose 
consumers to unapproved drug products and fraudulently marketed 
drug products 
• Modernize and enhance information technology systems to collect, 
store, and analyze regulatory, scientific, and risk-based information 
necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical products
Supply chain safety is a shared responsibility of not only the producer but 
also the country of origin, the importer, the importing country, and the final 
company in the supply chain. Companies that sell contaminated products 
because of loose supply chain oversight need to face serious penalties and 
cannot excuse themselves by blaming their suppliers.
Companies will need to have a strong supply chain management 
system in order to withstand the increased scrutiny by FDA. Companies 
will need to start to review their supply chain management program now, 
identify gaps, and address them before an FDA inspection. Additionally, 
those companies that mostly use contract manufacturers to produce and 
distribute their products will need to assure that they have tight control over 
those contractors since it appears that FDA will now hold them responsible.
Food and medical product companies will need to ensure that their 
supplier management programs are compliant, maintain oversight, and 
facilitate strong supplier relationships. They should also ensure that their 
suppliers are evaluated and that regulations and guidance are followed 
according to the product or service they provide. Companies should focus 
on several areas in their supplier programs, such as:
• Knowledge about their supply chains, including participants and 
vulnerabilities
• Risk management of the supply chain
• Qualification of prospective suppliers
• Audits and testing programs based on identified risks
• Quality and performance of suppliers
• Building relationship with suppliers, such as partnerships, alliances, 
and so on68  Chapter Two
More and more, FDA is observing companies that do not have control 
over their supply chain. These companies need to ensure compliance and 
begin treating their suppliers as an extension of their own company. 
The drug-shortage crisis in the United States is not just a supply chain 
issue but also a quality-management crisis with life-and-death implications. 
These crises are driven by poor supply chain coordination and market 
failure. Shortages of pharmaceutical drugs pose a serious and growing 
threat to public health. Drug shortages are becoming more severe as well 
as more frequent. The affected medicines include cancer treatments, 
anesthesia drugs, and other drugs that are critical to the treatment and 
prevention of serious diseases and life-threatening conditions.

Principles of Quality
Risk Management
KEY PRINCIPLES
ISO 31000:2018 describes eight key principles that view risk management as 
an elementary process of generating success and value for the organization. 
These eight principles can be regarded as the basic and essential qualities 
required for risk management. They are:
1. Integrated. Risk management is not a stand-alone activity 
that is separate from the main activities and processes of 
the organization. Risk management is a responsibility of 
an organization’s management and an integral part of all 
organizational processes, including strategic planning and 
all project and change management processes. It is a part of 
decision-making in every department and embedded into the 
organization’s processes. 
2. Structured and Comprehensive. Approaching risk management 
in a systematic way contributes to efficiency and consistent 
results within the organization as well as a comprehension for 
everyone involved. Risk management is structured with guidelines 
and procedures to follow in order to maintain productivity 
and efficacy.
3. Customized. Risk management processes are not one-size￾fits-all and must be tailored to the organization’s external and 
internal context in order to reach objectives. When the context is 
established in both internal and external environments, objectives 
can be captured and risk management can be customized to the 
unique organization.
6970  Chapter Three
4. Inclusive. The involvement of stakeholders allows their knowledge 
and views to be considered, guaranteeing that risk management 
is relevant and up to date. Risk management is transparent; it is 
easy to understand and doesn’t include confusing jargon, allowing 
stakeholders to be included in the framework.
5. Dynamic. Context and knowledge within an organization 
change constantly and should be acknowledged as they do. Risk 
management must respond to change continually and in a timely 
manner to maintain efficiency and results. Risks emerge, change, 
and disappear as internal and external events occur, so risk 
management must be anticipatory.
6. Best Available Information. An organization will never have 
all the information needed, but action must be taken when an 
organization has the best available data. Historical and current 
information, as well as the limitations of these, must be taken 
into account. All known information should be available to 
stakeholders.
7. Human and Cultural Factors. Risk management is influenced 
significantly by human behavior and culture. The organization’s 
capabilities, as well as the goals of the people within and around 
it, must be recognized by risk management to achieve, or inhibit, 
the goals of the business.
8. Continual Improvement. Improving continually through 
experience ensures the organization’s resiliency. PDCA is a risk 
management process: plan, do, check, act. This is a cycle that 
keeps the organization continually improving while factors change 
over time. Appropriately adapting to results in risk management 
allows the organization to grow exponentially in every aspect and 
continue to do so. 
These eight principles are the foundation for managing risk and are con￾sidered when creating processes in all areas of an organization with the 
ISO 31000 standard. Without the foundation provided by these developed 
principles, the framework of ISO 31000 risk management would not be 
sound. The best risk management uses these principles to manage uncer￾tainty for an organization to reach its objectives and continue achieving 
goals. When an organization manages risk while incorporating the eight 
principles, it will see consistent and reliable results.
Regarding this same topic, the Product Quality Research Institute 
Manufacturing Technical Committee (PQRI–MTC) commissioned a study Principles of Quality Risk Management  71
(Frank et al. 2011) to summarize actual risk management practices. The 
outcome of this study, in terms of the main quality risk management prin￾ciples used by pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, is:
1. Compliance with applicable laws: Risk assessment should be used 
to assess how to ensure compliance and to determine the resulting 
prioritization for action—not for a decision regarding the need to 
fulfill applicable regulations or legal requirements. 
2. Risk can only be effectively managed when it is identified, 
assessed, considered for further mitigation, and communicated. 
This principle embodies the four stages of an effective quality 
risk management process as defined by ICH Q9: risk assessment 
(risk identification, analysis, and evaluation), risk control (risk 
reduction and acceptance), risk communication, and risk review.
3. All quality risk evaluations must be based on scientific and 
process-specific knowledge and ultimately linked primarily to 
the protection of the patient. Risk assessment is based on a strong 
understanding of the underlying science, applicable regulations, 
and related processes involved with the risk under analysis. 
Collectively, these components should be assessed first and 
foremost with regard to the potential impact to the patient. 
4. Effective risk management requires a sufficient understanding 
of the business, the potential impact of the risk, and ownership of 
the results of any risk management assessment. 
5. Risk assessment must consider the probability of a negative event 
in combination with the severity of that event. This principle also 
serves as a useful working definition for risk (risk represents the 
combination of the probability and severity of any given event). 
6. It is not necessary or appropriate to always use a formal risk 
management process. Rather, the use of an informal risk 
management process (for example, an empirical assessment) 
is acceptable for areas that are less complex and have lower 
potential risk. Risk decisions are made by industry every day. 
The complexity of the events surrounding each decision and the 
potential risk involved are important inputs in determining the 
appropriate risk assessment methodology and corresponding level 
of analysis required. For less complex, less risky decisions, a 
qualitative analysis (decision tree) of the options may be all that 
is required.72  Chapter Three
To be effective and efficient, organizations should aim at the appropriate 
level of performance of their risk management framework in line with 
the criticality of the decisions that are to be made. The list of attributes 
below represents a high level of performance in managing risk. To assist 
organizations in measuring their own performance against these criteria, 
some indicators are given for each attribute. The key outcomes are that the 
organization has a current, correct, and comprehensive understanding of 
its risks, and the organization’s risks are within its risk criteria.
Continual Improvement
An emphasis is placed on continual improvement in risk management 
through the setting of organizational performance goals, measurement, 
review, and the subsequent modification of processes, systems, resources, 
capability, and skills. This risk management performance assessment is 
an integral part of the overall organization’s performance assessment and 
measurement system for departments and individuals.
Full Accountability for Risks
Enhanced risk management includes comprehensive, fully defined, and 
fully accepted accountability for risks, controls, and risk treatment tasks. 
Designated individuals fully accept accountability, are appropriately 
skilled, and have adequate resources to check controls, monitor risks, 
improve controls, and communicate effectively about risks and their 
management to external and internal stakeholders. The organization 
ensures that those who are accountable are equipped to fulfill that role 
by providing them with the authority, time, training, resources, and skills 
sufficient to assume their accountabilities.
Application of Risk Management 
in All Decision-Making
All decision-making within the organization, whatever the level of 
importance and significance, involves the explicit consideration of risks 
and the application of risk management to some appropriate degree. This 
can be indicated by records of meetings and decisions showing that explicit 
discussions on risks took place. In addition, it should be possible to see that 
all components of risk management are represented within key processes 
for decision-making in the organization, for example, for decisions on the 
allocation of capital, on major projects, and on restructuring and organi￾zational changes. For these reasons, soundly based risk management is seen 
within the organization as providing the basis for effective governance.Principles of Quality Risk Management  73
Continual Communications
Enhanced risk management includes continual communications with 
external and internal stakeholders, including comprehensive and frequent 
reporting of risk management performance, as part of good governance. 
This can be indicated by communication with stakeholders as an integral 
and essential component of risk management. Communication is rightly 
seen as a two-way process such that properly informed decisions can be 
made about the level of risks and the need for risk treatment against prop￾erly established and comprehensive risk criteria.
Full Integration into the Organization’s 
Governance Structure
Risk management is viewed as central to the organization’s management 
processes, such that risks are considered in terms of the effect of uncer￾tainty on objectives. The governance structure and process are based on the 
management of risk. Effective risk management is regarded by managers 
as essential for the achievement of the organization’s objectives.
This section can be fairly summarized into the following two primary 
principles of quality risk management:
1. The evaluation of the risk to quality should be based on scientific 
knowledge and ultimately link to the protection of the patient.
2. The level of effort, formality, and documentation of the quality 
risk management process should be commensurate with the level 
of risk.
SCIENCE AND RISK-BASED 
APPROACH TO PRODUCT QUALITY
As medical products manufacturing evolves from an art to a science￾and engineering-based activity, application of this enhanced science and 
engineering knowledge in regulatory decision-making, establishment of 
specifications, and evaluation of manufacturing processes should improve 
the efficiency and effectiveness of both manufacturing and regulatory 
decision-making. As a pillar of the initiative (and guiding principle), regu￾lators must ensure that science-based policies and standards form the 
foundation upon which product quality regulation is based. One cannot 
forget that people (the American public, in the case of FDA) are the ulti￾mate customers of medical product manufacturing companies, and because 
the public is often unable to judge the quality of a product, the goal of the 
a) give assurance that the quality 
management system can achieve its 
intended result(s);
b) enhance desirable effects;
c) prevent, or reduce, undesired 
effects;
d) achieve improvement.”74  Chapter Three
regulatory system is to make sure patients do not have to worry about the 
quality of their medicines and medical products.
A great example of this new focus is the implementation of new 
technologies, such as process analytical technology (PAT), which is detailed 
in Chapter 5. To keep pace with the many advances in manufacturing 
quality management and to be able to more effectively allocate its limited 
regulatory resources, FDA is implementing a risk-based approach to regu￾lating pharmaceutical manufacturing. The approach is applied to the 
review, compliance, and inspectional components of FDA regulation.
The intensity of FDA oversight needed to be related to several factors, 
including the degree of a manufacturer’s product and process understanding 
and the robustness of the quality system controlling their process. For 
example, changes to complex products made with complex manufacturing 
processes may need more regulatory oversight. Process changes with 
critical variables that have not been sufficiently defined (as often happens 
with many older products) may require the submission of additional data 
or comparability protocols. In other cases, changes in well-understood 
processes could be managed under a firm’s change control procedures. 
Additional factors in performing risk-based quality assessments include 
instances when manufacturing processes are crucial to the safety of the 
product (as a sterilization process for sterile products) or when products 
serve a critical medical need or have a critical public health impact (such as 
products for the prevention of communicable diseases).
Other considerations, such as public health impact and the compliance 
status or compliance history of the manufacturer, can also continue to 
influence the intensity of FDA oversight. Following are several FDA 
examples of the application of this science- and risk-based approach:
• Prioritization of United States manufacturing site inspection. 
For almost 20 years now, FDA has used a risk-based approach for 
prioritizing domestic manufacturing site inspections for certain 
human pharmaceuticals. The purpose of this approach is to help 
the Agency predict where its inspections are likely to achieve 
the greatest public health impact. The frequency and/or scope of 
inspections should be reduced for firms that FDA determines have 
acquired sufficient process understanding and have succeeded 
in implementing effective quality systems approaches. FDA 
expectation was also to create positive incentives for other firms 
to implement effective quality systems at their manufacturing sites. 
At the same time, the Agency started to apply risk-based principles 
to the product quality review process. Principles of Quality Risk Management  75
• Risk-based approach for clinical investigations. In August 
2011, FDA released a draft guidance entitled Oversight of 
Clinical Investigations: A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring. 
FDA published the draft guidance to assist sponsors of clinical 
investigations in developing risk-based monitoring strategies and 
plans for clinical investigations of human drug and biological 
products, medical devices, and combinations thereof. The 
guidance is intended to make clear that sponsors can use a variety 
of approaches to meet their monitoring responsibilities during 
clinical investigations. The guidance describes a risk-based 
approach to monitoring that focuses on critical study parameters 
and relies on a combination of monitoring activities to effectively 
oversee a study. For example, the guidance encourages greater 
use of centralized monitoring methods where appropriate. The 
guidance also makes recommendations about how to develop 
monitoring plans and document monitoring activities (Food and 
Drug Administration 2011b).
• New process validation guidance. In January 2011, FDA 
published the guidance Process Validation: General Principles 
and Practices, and it followed a risk-based approach. This is 
consistent with the direction of previous drafts. The new guidance 
is also consistent with ICH Q5A and Q10 and European guidelines. 
It confirms that process validation should be looked at as a life￾cycle activity rather than a one-time event. FDA says the guidance 
“encourages the use of modern pharmaceutical development 
concepts, quality risk management, and quality systems at all 
stages of the manufacturing process lifecycle….”
As with these other guidelines, FDA’s final guidance focuses on a risk-based 
approach and does not include specific recommendations. For instance, 
those expecting it to specify a number of process performance qualification 
batches required for licensure will undoubtedly be disappointed. Despite 
industry requests for clarification on this point, the guidance recommends 
the use of risk-based decision-making during performance qualification to 
assess process consistency, and acknowledges that risk management tools 
should be used during all stages of process validation. While many would 
have liked to see FDA endorse the de facto standard of “three consecutive 
batches” for process performance qualification, the agency’s decision to 
leave this out allows companies flexibility in interpreting this requirement. 
If process validation work conducted during the design phase is done prop￾erly, three process performance qualification batches should be sufficient to 76  Chapter Three
demonstrate process consistency. Expanded characterization and sampling 
during the verification stage further reduces the risk of this approach.
The new guidance confirms the evolution of process validation from a 
one-time activity performed just prior to regulatory submissions to a life￾cycle activity that begins early in development and continues long after 
commercialization. According to FDA, the guidance “… encourages the use 
of modern pharmaceutical development concepts, quality risk management, 
and quality systems at all stages of the manufacturing process lifecycle,” 
an approach that has been used for decades in other industries to improve 
product quality, lower costs, and decrease time to market. It is now time for 
the biopharmaceutical industry to embrace and implement these concepts 
to improve their drug development process and decrease regulatory risk.
• Quality Management Maturity (QMM) Program. FDA’s Center 
for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is establishing a 
program to promote quality management maturity (QMM) at 
drug manufacturing establishments. The QMM program aims to 
encourage drug manufacturers to implement quality management 
practices that go beyond current cGMP requirements. The goals 
of this program are fourfold:
1. Foster a strong quality culture mindset
2. Recognize establishments that have advanced quality 
management practices and acknowledge establishments that 
strive to continually improve quality management practices
3. Identify areas where quality management practices can be 
enhanced and provide suggestions for growth opportunities
4. Minimize risks to product availability to assure reliable 
market supply
Adopting mature quality management practices supports a more reliable 
drug supply chain by reducing the occurrence of quality-related failures and 
improving the ability of establishments to maintain performance during 
expected and unexpected supply chain disruptions. Integrating business 
and manufacturing operations with quality practices and technological 
advancements can help achieve higher levels of maturity. This can optimize 
manufacturing process performance and product quality, enhance supply 
chain reliability, and foster proactive continual improvement.Principles of Quality Risk Management  77
QUALITY SYSTEMS APPROACH
Best practices in quality management methods, particularly in other high￾tech industries, have undergone significant progress since 1978 when the 
drug cGMP regulations were updated. FDA wanted to ensure that its regu￾latory practices encourage similar progress in the pharmaceutical industry. 
The guidance for industry Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical 
Current Good Manufacturing Practice, published in September 2006 
(Food and Drug Administration 2006), describes a comprehensive quality 
systems model that manufacturers could use and highlights the model’s 
consistency with the cGMP regulations for manufacturing human and 
veterinary drugs, including biological products. The guidance explains 
how manufacturers implementing such a comprehensive quality system 
can ensure that they comply fully with the cGMP regulations (21 CFR 
parts 210 and 211).
This guidance describes a comprehensive quality systems model that, 
if implemented, will allow manufacturers to support and sustain robust, 
modern quality systems that are consistent with cGMP regulations. The 
guidance demonstrates how and where the elements of this comprehensive 
model can fit within the requirements of the cGMP regulations. The 
inherent flexibility of the cGMP regulations should enable manufacturers 
to implement a quality system in a form that is appropriate for their specific 
operations. The overarching philosophy articulated in both the cGMP 
regulations and in robust modern quality systems is: 
Quality should be built into the product, and testing alone cannot 
be relied on to ensure product quality.
This guidance is intended to serve as a bridge between the 1978 regulations 
and our current understanding of quality systems. A quality system 
addresses the public and private sectors’ mutual goal of providing a high￾quality drug product to patients and prescribers. A well-built quality system 
should reduce the number of (or prevent) recalls, returned or salvaged 
products, and defective products entering the marketplace. 
It is important that the cGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent 
possible with other widely used QMSs, including ISO 9000, non–U.S. 
pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA’s own medical 
device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step in 
highlighting common elements between the cGMP regulations and QMS. 
With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing 
prevalence of drug–device and biologic–device combination products, the 78  Chapter Three
convergence of quality management principles across different regions and 
among various product types is very desirable.
FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with 
manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective 
risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, 
equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory 
submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate 
process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addi￾tion, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing 
problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.
A quality system can provide the necessary framework for implement￾ing quality by design, continual improvement, and risk management in the 
drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer 
can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors 
such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use 
of finite resources. The following key concepts are used throughout the 
guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products:
• Quality. Every pharmaceutical product has established identity, 
strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure 
the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes 
of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means 
achieving these characteristics for a product. 
• QbD and product development. QbD means designing and 
developing a product and associated manufacturing processes 
that will be used during product development to ensure that the 
product consistently attains a predefined level of quality at the end 
of the manufacturing process. QbD, in conjunction with a quality 
system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product 
knowledge and process understanding from drug development to 
the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development 
changes and optimization. The cGMP regulations, when viewed in 
their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design.
• Quality risk management. Quality risk management is a valuable 
component of an effective quality systems framework. Quality 
risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of 
specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, 
assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, 
and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and 
corrective actions. Principles of Quality Risk Management  79
• CAPA (corrective and preventive action). CAPA is a well￾known cGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, 
understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to 
prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as 
three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance: 
1. Remedial corrections of an identified problem 
2. Root cause analysis with corrective action to help 
understand the cause of the deviation and potentially 
prevent recurrence of a similar problem 
3. Preventive action to avert recurrence of a similar 
potential problem 
• Change control. Change control is another well-known cGMP 
concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended 
consequences. The cGMP regulations provide for change control 
primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality 
control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (for example, 
changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute, or 
bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory 
approval. Effective change control activities (for example, quality 
planning and control of revisions to specifications, process 
parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality 
system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating 
a regulatory environment that encourages change toward continual 
improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to 
make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability 
of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements 
resulting from knowledge gained during a product’s life cycle.4
General Quality Risk
Management Process
INTRODUCTION TO THE QUALITY 
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Quality risk management is a systematic process for the assessment, control, 
communication, and review of risks to the quality of a drug product across 
the product life cycle. The emphasis on each component of the model might 
vary from case to case, but a robust process will incorporate consider￾ation of all the elements at a level of detail that is commensurate with the 
specific risk.
The success of risk management will depend on the effectiveness of 
the management framework in providing the foundations and arrangements 
that will embed it throughout the organization at all levels. The framework 
assists in managing risks effectively through the application of the risk 
management process at different levels and within specific contexts. 
The framework ensures that information about risk derived from the 
risk management process is adequately reported and used as a basis for 
decision-making and accountability at all relevant organizational levels.
The different components of the framework for managing risk and the 
way in which they interrelate in an iterative manner are shown in Figure 
4.1. The main purpose of this framework is to assist the organization in 
integrating risk management into its overall management system (see ISO 
31000:2018 for complete details).
Figure 4.2 depicts a typical model for the risk management process 
based on ICH Q9(R1).

RESPONSIBILITIES AND INITIATION
OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Quality risk management activities are usually undertaken by interdisci￾plinary teams. When teams are formed, they should include experts from 
the appropriate areas (for example, quality unit, business development, 
engineering, regulatory affairs, production operations, sales and marketing, 84  Chapter Four
legal, statistics, clinical, and so on) in addition to individuals who are 
knowledgeable about the quality risk management process. Decision￾makers should take responsibility for coordinating quality risk management 
across various functions and departments of their organization. They also 
should ensure that a quality risk management process is defined, deployed, 
and reviewed and that adequate resources are available.
Quality risk management should include systematic processes designed 
to coordinate, facilitate, and improve science-based decision-making 
with respect to risk. Possible steps used to initiate and plan a quality risk 
management process include the following:
• Define the problem and/or risk question, including pertinent 
assumptions identifying the potential for risk
• Assemble background information and/or data on the potential 
hazard, harm, or human health impact relevant to the risk 
assessment
• Identify a leader and critical resources
• Specify a timeline, deliverables, and appropriate level of decision￾making for the risk management process
RISK ASSESSMENT
Risk assessment provides decision-makers and responsible parties with 
an improved understanding of risks that could affect achievement of 
objectives, and the adequacy and effectiveness of controls already in place. 
It consists of the identification of hazards and the analysis and evaluation
of risks associated with exposure to those hazards. Risk assessment begins 
with a well-defined problem description or risk question. When the risk 
in question is well defined, an appropriate risk management tool, and the 
types of information that will address the risk question, will be more readily 
identifiable. This provides a basis for decisions about the most appropriate 
approach to be used to treat the risks. The output of risk assessment is an 
input to the decision-making processes of the organization. As an aid to 
clearly defining the risk(s) for risk assessment purposes, three fundamental 
questions are often helpful:
1. What might go wrong?
2. What is the likelihood (probability) it will go wrong?
3. What are the consequences (severity)?General Quality Risk Management Process  85
Risk assessment is the overall process of risk identification, risk analysis, 
and risk evaluation (see Figure 4.2). 
Hazard Identification
Hazard identification is the systematic use of information to identify 
hazards related to the risk question or problem description. Information 
can include historical data, theoretical analysis, informed opinions, and 
stakeholders’ concerns. Hazard identification addresses the “What might 
go wrong?” question, including identifying the possible consequences. This 
provides the basis for further steps in the quality risk management process. 
The organization should identify sources of hazard, their causes, and 
their potential consequences. The aim of this step is to generate a compre￾hensive list of hazards based on those events that might create, enhance, 
prevent, degrade, accelerate, or delay the achievement of objectives. 
Comprehensive identification is critical because a hazard that is not identi￾fied at this stage will not be included in further analysis. Once a hazard is 
identified, the organization should identify any existing controls such as 
design features, people, processes, and systems.
Identification should include hazards regardless of whether their 
source is under the control of the organization and even when the hazard 
source or cause may not be evident. Hazard identification should include 
the examination of the indirect effects of consequences, including cascade 
and cumulative effects. It should also consider a wide range of conse￾quences even if the hazard source or cause may not be evident. As well as 
identifying what might happen, it is necessary to consider possible causes 
and scenarios that show what consequences can occur. All significant 
causes and consequences should be considered.
The organization should apply hazard identification tools and tech￾niques that are suited to its objectives and capabilities, and to the risks 
faced. Relevant and up-to-date information is important in identifying 
hazards. Personnel with appropriate knowledge and training should be 
involved in identifying hazards.
Hazard identification methods can include:
• Evidence-based methods, examples of which are checklists and 
reviews of historical data
• Systematic team approaches where a team of experts follow a 
systematic process to identify hazards by means of a structured set 
of prompts or questions86  Chapter Four
• Inductive reasoning techniques such as hazard and operability 
(HAZOP), which is described in Chapter 6
Various supporting techniques can be used to improve accuracy and com￾pleteness in hazard identification, including brainstorming and Delphi 
methodology. Irrespective of the actual techniques employed, it is important 
that due recognition is given to human and organizational factors when 
identifying hazards. Hence, deviations of human and organizational factors 
from the expected should be included in the hazard identification process 
as well as “hardware” or “software” events.
Preliminary Analysis. Hazards may be screened in order to identify the 
most significant ones or to exclude less significant or minor ones from 
further analysis. The purpose is to ensure that resources will be focused on 
the most significant hazards. 
Risk Analysis
Risk analysis is the estimation of the risk associated with the identified 
hazards. It is the qualitative or quantitative process of linking the likelihood 
of occurrence and severity of harms. In some risk management tools, the 
ability to detect the harm (known as detectability) is another factor in the 
estimation of risk.
Risk analysis involves developing an understanding of the risk. It 
provides an input into risk evaluation and into decisions on whether risks 
need to be treated, and on the most appropriate risk treatment strategies 
and methods. Risk analysis can also provide an input into making decisions 
where choices must be made and the options involve different types and 
levels of risk.
Risk analysis involves consideration of the causes and sources of risk, 
their consequences, and the likelihood that those consequences can occur. 
Factors that affect consequences and likelihood should be identified. Risk 
is analyzed by determining consequences and their likelihood, and other 
attributes of the risk. An event can have multiple consequences and affect 
multiple objectives. Existing controls or barriers and their effectiveness 
and efficiency should also be included in this analysis.
The way in which consequences and likelihood are expressed and the 
way in which they are combined to determine a level of risk should reflect 
the type of risk, the information available, and the purpose for which the 
risk assessment output is to be used. These should all be consistent with 
the risk criteria. It is also important to consider the interdependence of 
different risks and their sources. The confidence in the determination of 
the level of risk and its sensitivity to preconditions and assumptions should General Quality Risk Management Process  87
be considered in the analysis and communicated effectively to decision￾makers and, as appropriate, other stakeholders. Factors such as divergence 
of opinion among experts, uncertainty, availability, quality, quantity, and 
ongoing relevance of information, or limitations on modeling should be 
stated and can be highlighted.
Risk analysis can be undertaken with varying degrees of detail depend￾ing on the risk, the purpose of the analysis, and the information, data, and 
resources available. Analysis can be qualitative, semiquantitative, or quan￾titative, or a combination of these, depending on the circumstances. Conse￾quences and their likelihood can be determined by modeling the outcomes 
of an event or set of events, or by extrapolation from experimental studies 
or from available data. Consequences can be expressed in terms of tangible 
and intangible impacts. 
More than one technique may be required for complex applications. 
Risk analysis normally includes an estimation of the range of potential 
consequences that might arise from an event, situation, or circumstance, 
and their associated probabilities, in order to measure the level of risk. 
However, in some instances, such as when the consequences are likely to 
be insignificant or the probability is expected to be extremely low, a single 
parameter estimate may be sufficient for a decision to be made. In some 
circumstances, a consequence can occur as a result of a range of different 
events or conditions, or when the specific event is not identified. In this 
case, the focus of risk assessment is on analyzing the importance and 
vulnerability of the system components with a view to defining treatments 
that relate to levels of protection or recovery strategies.
Methods used in analyzing risks can be qualitative, semiquantitative, 
or quantitative. The degree of detail required will depend on the particular 
application, the availability of reliable data, and the decision-making 
needs of the organization. Some methods and the degree of detail of the 
analysis may be prescribed by legislation. Qualitative assessment defines 
consequence, probability, and level of risk by significance levels such as 
“high,” “medium,” and “low,” may combine consequence and probability, 
and evaluates the resultant level of risk against qualitative criteria. 
Semiquantitative methods use numerical rating scales for consequence and 
probability, and combine them to produce a level of risk using a formula. 
Scales may be linear or logarithmic or have some other relationship; 
formulae used can also vary.
Quantitative analysis estimates practical values for consequences and 
their probabilities, and produces values of the level of risk in specific units 
defined when developing the context. Full quantitative analysis may not 
always be possible or desirable due to insufficient information about the 
system or activity being analyzed, lack of data, influence of human factors, 88  Chapter Four
and so on, or because the effort of quantitative analysis is not warranted 
or required. In such circumstances, a comparative semiquantitative or 
qualitative ranking of risks by specialists, knowledgeable in their respective 
fields, may still be effective. In cases where the analysis is qualitative, there 
should be a clear explanation of all the terms employed, and the basis for 
all criteria should be recorded.
Even where full quantification has been carried out, it needs to be 
recognized that the levels of risk calculated are estimates. Care should be 
taken to ensure that they are not attributed a level of accuracy and precision 
inconsistent with the accuracy of the data and methods employed. Levels 
of risk should be expressed in the most suitable terms for the type of risk 
and in a form that aids risk evaluation. In some instances, the magnitude 
of a risk can be expressed as a probability distribution over a range of 
consequences.
Controls Assessment. The level of risk will depend on the adequacy and 
effectiveness of existing controls.
Questions to be addressed include:
• What are the existing controls for a particular risk?
• Are those controls capable of adequately treating the risk so it is 
controlled to a level that is tolerable?
• Are the controls operating in the manner intended and can they be 
demonstrated to be effective when required?
The level of effectiveness for a particular control, or suite of related controls, 
may be expressed qualitatively, semiquantitatively, or quantitatively. In 
most cases, a high level of accuracy is not warranted. However, it may be 
valuable to express and record a measure of risk control effectiveness so 
judgments can be made on whether effort is best expended in improving a 
control or providing a different risk treatment.
Consequence analysis determines the nature and type of impact that 
could occur assuming that a particular event, situation, or circumstance has 
occurred. An event may have a range of impacts of different magnitudes 
and affect a range of different objectives and different stakeholders. The 
types of consequences to be analyzed and the stakeholders affected will 
have been decided when the context was established. Consequence analysis 
can vary from a simple description of outcomes to detailed quantitative 
modeling or vulnerability analysis.
Impacts may have a low consequence but high probability, or a high 
consequence and low probability, or some intermediate outcome. In some General Quality Risk Management Process  89
cases, it is appropriate to focus on risks with potentially very large out￾comes, as these are often of greatest concern to managers. In other cases, 
it may be important to analyze both high- and low-consequence risks 
separately. For example, a frequent (chronic) but low-impact problem 
may have large cumulative or long-term effects. In addition, the treatment 
actions for dealing with these two distinct kinds of risks are often quite 
different, so it is useful to analyze them separately.
Consequence analysis can involve:
• Taking into consideration existing controls to treat the 
consequences, together with all relevant contributory factors that 
have an effect on the consequences
• Relating the consequences of the risk to the original objectives
• Considering both immediate consequences and those that may arise 
after a certain time has elapsed, if this is consistent with the scope 
of the assessment
• Considering secondary consequences, such as those impacting 
associated systems, activities, equipment, or organizations
Risk Estimation: Severity and Likelihood Analysis. Several methods 
can be used to estimate risk. Quantitative risk estimation is preferable when 
suitable data are available. In other cases, without suitable data, qualitative 
methods of risk estimation can be used. Risk estimation is based on the 
combination of the following two components:
• The probability of occurrence of harm
• The consequences of that harm (how severe it might be)
A third element frequently considered is the detectability of the harm 
situation. In the medical product manufacturing arena, this third element 
is carried out through numerous tests and analyses performed on the 
product prior to its release to customers. Severity levels and likelihood 
estimation must be part of a formal risk assessment procedure, which will 
help guide the risk assessment process and provide consistency throughout 
the process.
Severity Analysis. To categorize the severity of the potential harm, appro￾priate descriptors must be developed for potential risk and related conse￾quences. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 provide examples of severity categorization.90  Chapter Four

Table 4.2 Severity categorization.
Likelihood (Probability) Estimation. Three general approaches can be 
employed to estimate probability; they may be used individually or jointly:
a. Relevant historical data can be used to identify events or 
situations that have occurred in the past and hence be used to 
extrapolate the probability of their occurrence in the future. 
The data used should be relevant to the type of system, facility, 
organization, or activity being considered, and to the operational 
standards of the organization involved. If historically there 
is a very low frequency of occurrence, then any estimate of 
probability will be very uncertain. This applies especially for 
zero occurrences, when one cannot assume the event, situation, 
or circumstance will not occur in the future.General Quality Risk Management Process  91
b. Probability estimation using predictive techniques such as fault 
tree analysis (see Chapter 6). When historical data are unavailable 
or inadequate, it is necessary to derive probability by analysis of 
the system, activity, equipment, or organization and its associated 
failure or success states. Numerical data for equipment, humans, 
organizations, and systems from operational experience, or 
published data sources, are then combined to produce an estimate 
of the probability of the top event. When using predictive 
techniques, it is important to ensure that due allowance has been 
made in the analysis for the possibility of common mode failures 
involving the coincidental failure of several different parts or 
components within the system arising from the same cause. 
Simulation techniques may be required to generate probability 
of equipment and structural failures due to aging and other 
degradation processes by calculating the effects of uncertainties.
c. Expert opinion can be used in a systematic and structured process 
to estimate probability. Expert judgments should draw on all 
relevant available information, including historical, system￾specific, organization-specific, experimental, design, and so on. 
There are several formal methods for eliciting expert judgment 
that provide an aid to the formulation of appropriate questions. 
The methods available include the Delphi approach (described 
in Chapter 6), paired comparisons, category rating, and absolute 
probability judgments. Tables 4.3 and 4.4 show two examples of 
probability estimation using qualitative and quantitative indexes. 
Uncertainties and Sensitivities. There are often considerable uncertainties 
associated with the analysis of risk. An understanding of uncertainties is 
necessary to interpret and communicate risk analysis results effectively. 
The analysis of uncertainties associated with data, methods, and models 
used to identify and analyze risk plays an important part in their application. 
Uncertainty analysis involves the determination of the variation or impre￾cision in the results that is the result of the collective variation in the 
parameters and assumptions used to define the results.
Category Description
High Likely to happen (often, frequent)
Medium Can happen, but not frequently
Low Unlikely to happen (rare, remote)
Table 4.3 Simplified example of quality probability level.92  Chapter Four
Category Probability range
Frequent ≥ 10–3
Probable < 10–3 and ≥ 10–4
Occasional < 10–4 and ≥ 10–5
Remote < 10–5 and ≥ 10–6
Improbable < 10–6
Table 4.4 Quantitative probability levels.1
Uncertainty is due to a combination of incomplete knowledge about a 
process and its expected or unexpected variability. Typical sources of 
uncertainty include gaps in knowledge, gaps in pharmaceutical science 
and process understanding, sources of harm (for example, failure 
modes of a process, sources of variability), and probability of the detection 
of problems.
Risk Evaluation
Risk evaluation compares the identified and analyzed risk against given 
risk criteria, and based on this comparison, the need for control can be 
considered. In doing an effective risk assessment, the robustness of the 
data set is important because it determines the quality of the output. 
Revealing assumptions and reasonable sources of uncertainty will enhance 
confidence in this output and/or help identify its limitations.
The purpose of risk evaluation is to assist in making decisions, based 
on the outcomes of risk analysis, about which risks need treatment and the 
priority for treatment implementation. 
The output of a risk assessment is either a quantitative estimate of 
risk or a qualitative description of a range of risk. When risk is expressed 
quantitatively, a numerical probability is used. Alternatively, risk can be 
expressed using qualitative descriptors, such as “high,” “medium,” or 
“low,” which should be defined in as much detail as possible. Sometimes a 
risk score is used to further define descriptors in risk ranking. 
Decisions should take into account the wider context of the risk and 
include consideration of the tolerance of the risks borne by parties other 
than the organization that benefits from the risk. Decisions should be 
made in accordance with legal, regulatory, and other requirements. In 
some circumstances, the risk evaluation can lead to a decision to undertake 
further analysis. The risk evaluation can also lead to a decision not to treat 
the risk in any way other than maintaining existing controls. General Quality Risk Management Process  93
Decisions may include:
• Whether a risk needs treatment (be controlled)
• Priorities for treatment 
• Whether an activity should be undertaken 
• Which of a number of paths should be followed
The nature of the decisions that need to be made and the criteria that 
will be used to make those decisions were decided when establishing the 
context, but they need to be revisited in more detail at this stage now that 
more is known about the particular risks identified.
The simplest framework for defining risk criteria is a single level 
that divides risks that need treatment from those that do not. This gives 
attractively simple results but does not reflect the uncertainties involved 
both in estimating risks and in defining the boundary between those that 
need treatment and those that do not.
The decision about whether and how to treat the risk may depend 
on the costs and benefits of taking the risk and the costs and benefits of 
implementing improved controls.
A common approach is to divide risks into three bands or areas (see 
Figure 4.3):
a. An upper band where the level of risk is regarded as intolerable 
regardless of the benefits the activity may bring, and risk 
treatment is essential whatever its cost
b. A middle band (or “gray area”) where costs and benefits are con￾sidered and opportunities balanced against potential consequences
c. A lower band where the level of risk is regarded as negligible, or 
so small that no risk treatment measures are needed

The as low as reasonably practicable, or ALARP, criteria system 
used in safety applications follows this approach: in the middle band, there 
is a sliding scale for low risks where costs and benefits can be directly 
compared, whereas for high risks, the potential for harm must be reduced 
until the cost of further reduction is entirely disproportionate to the safety 
benefit gained.
Risk Reduction “As Far as Possible” (AFAP) Compared 
to “As Low as Reasonably Practicable” (ALARP)
For manufacturers of medical devices, when looking to manage and 
reduce risk, many have looked to the ISO 14971 standard as a means of 
managing the risks associated with the manufacture and processing of 
their medical device. This standard references and suggests the use of 
ALARP. As a result, ALARP has become widely applied and is the basis 
for the acceptance by many manufacturers of the low to moderate levels 
of residual risks that may be associated with the development, processing, 
and use of their medical devices. However, under European Medical 
Device Regulations (MDR 2017/745) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical 
Devices Regulation (IVDR 2017/746), the requirement for those involved 
in development and manufacture of medical devices is that all risks need to 
be reduced “as far as possible.”
The main difference between them is that ALARP allows a manu￾facturer to take economic impacts into consideration when deciding what 
are acceptable and unacceptable risks. AFAP does not allow economic 
impacts to form part of the risk decision-making process.
An important part of the risk analysis process is to ensure that you 
do not introduce new hazards into your quest to eliminate or minimize 
hazards. FDA describes its expectations about risk-based decisions in the 
preamble of 21 CFR Part 820. FDA states that if any risk is judged to be 
unacceptable, it should be reduced to acceptable levels by the appropriate 
means, which may include a redesign or warnings. On the other hand, the 
EU MDR regulation has a very strong emphasis on risk management. Risk 
is mentioned 243 times in the regulation compared to a combined total of 
only 69 times in the two original medical device directives. 
ISO 14971:2019 refers you to your own risk acceptability policy to 
determine risk control options. Your risk policy establishes criteria for the 
level of control and may employ one of the following three approaches. 
Specifically, Clause 4.2 of ISO 14971:2019, Note 1 states that “The 
manufacturer’s policy for establishing criteria for risk acceptability can 
define the approaches to risk control: reducing risk as low as reasonably 
practicable, reducing risk as low as reasonably achievable, or reducing risk 
as far as possible without adversely affecting the benefit-risk ratio.” This General Quality Risk Management Process  95
brings manufacturers to a point where they can manage risk based on all 
the requirements.
European requirements (MDR and IVDR) with respect to reducing 
risk include:
• Reduce risk as far as possible
• Eliminate risk (or reduce as far as possible)
• Minimize risk
• Remove risk (or reduce as far as possible)
• Remove risk (or minimize as far as possible)
• Reduce risk to the lowest possible
• Avoid risk to the lowest possible
The ALARP concept has a legal interpretation that implies financial 
considerations. However, the European MDR does not allow financial 
considerations to override the General Safety and Performance Require￾ments for safety and performance of medical devices. If risk controls 
are not implemented, the justification for this must be on a basis other 
than financial. Instead of claiming that the residual risks are ALARP, 
manufacturers will need to demonstrate that risks are reduced AFAP by 
showing objective evidence that all possible risk control options were 
considered and implemented.
RISK CONTROL
Risk control includes decision-making to reduce and/or accept risks. 
The purpose of risk control is to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. 
The amount of effort used for risk control should be proportional to the 
significance of the risk. Decision-makers might use different processes, 
including benefit–cost analysis, to determine the optimal level of risk 
control. Risk control might focus on the following questions:
• Is the risk above an acceptable level?
• What can be done to reduce or eliminate risks?
• What is the appropriate balance between benefits, risk, and 
resources?
• Are new risks created as a result of the identified risks being 
controlled?
Table 4.5 includes some examples of risk control activities.96  Chapter Four

Table 4.5 Examples of risk control activities.
Risk Reduction
Risk reduction focuses on processes for mitigating or avoiding quality 
risk when it exceeds a specified (acceptable) level. Risk reduction might 
include actions taken to mitigate the severity and probability of harm. 
Processes that improve the detectability of hazards and quality risks might 
also be used as part of a risk control strategy. The implementation of risk 
reduction measures can introduce new risks into the system or increase the 
significance of other existing risks. Hence, it might be appropriate to revisit 
the risk assessment to identify and evaluate any possible change in risk 
after implementing a risk reduction process.
Risk treatment involves selecting one or more options for modifying 
risks, and implementing those options. Once implemented, treatments pro￾vide or modify the controls. Risk treatment involves a cyclical process of:
• Assessing a risk treatment
• Deciding whether residual risk levels are tolerable
• If not tolerable, generating a new risk treatment
• Assessing the effectiveness of that treatment
Selection of Risk Treatment Options. Selecting the most appropriate 
risk treatment option involves balancing the costs and efforts of imple￾mentation against the benefits derived, with regard to legal or regulatory 
requirements. Several treatment options can be considered and applied 
either individually or in combination. The organization can normally bene￾fit from the adoption of a combination of treatment options. When select￾ing risk treatment options, the organization should consider the values and 
perceptions of stakeholders and the most appropriate ways to communicate General Quality Risk Management Process  97
with them. Where risk treatment options can have an impact on risk in 
other units of the organization or on stakeholders, these should be involved 
in the decision.
Though equally effective, some risk treatments can be more acceptable 
to some stakeholders than to others. The treatment plan should clearly 
identify the priority order in which individual risk treatments should be 
implemented. Risk treatment itself can introduce risks. A significant risk 
can be the failure or ineffectiveness of the risk treatment measures. Moni￾toring needs to be an integral part of the risk treatment plan to give assur￾ance that the measures remain effective. Risk treatment can also introduce 
secondary risks that need to be assessed, treated, monitored, and reviewed. 
Treatment plans should be integrated with the management processes of 
the organization and discussed with appropriate stakeholders. Decision￾makers and other stakeholders should be aware of the nature and extent 
of the residual risk after risk treatment. The residual risk should be 
documented and subjected to monitoring, review and, where appropriate, 
further treatment. Table 4.6 depicts several examples of hazards and corre￾sponding risk reduction control measures when using medical devices.

Risk Acceptance
Risk acceptance is a decision to accept risk. Risk acceptance can be a 
formal decision to accept the residual risk or it can be a passive decision in 
which residual risks are not specified. For some types of harms, even the 
best quality risk management practices might not eliminate risk. In these 
circumstances, it might be agreed that an appropriate quality risk manage￾ment strategy has been applied and that the quality risk is reduced to a 
specified (acceptable) level. This (specified) acceptable level will depend 
on many parameters and should be decided on a case-by-case basis.
RISK DOCUMENTATION
AND COMMUNICATION
Risk communication is the sharing of information about risk and risk 
management between the decision-makers and others. Parties can commu￾nicate at any stage of the risk management process (see Figure 4.2, dashed 
arrows). The output/result of the quality risk management process should 
be appropriately communicated and documented (see Figure 4.2, solid 
arrows). Communications might include those among interested parties 
(for example, regulators and industry, industry and the patient, within a 
company, industry, or regulatory authority). The included information 
might relate to the existence, nature, form, probability, severity, accept￾ability, control, treatment, detectability, or other aspects of risks to quality. 
Communication need not be carried out for each risk acceptance. Between 
the industry and regulatory authorities, communication concerning quality 
risk management decisions might be effected through existing channels, as 
specified in regulations and guidances.
As with any important activity related to medical products, risk 
management activities must be traceable. 
Decisions concerning the creation of records should consider:
• The organization’s needs for continuous learning
• Benefits of reusing information for management purposes
• Costs and efforts involved in creating and maintaining records
• Legal, regulatory (for example retention period), and operational 
needs for records
The risk assessment process should be documented together with the results 
of the assessment. Risks should be expressed in understandable terms, and 
the units in which the level of risk is expressed should be clear. The extent General Quality Risk Management Process  99
of the report will depend on the objectives and scope of the assessment. 
Content of the report must be described within a standard procedure, and, 
except for very simple assessments, the documentation should include:
• Objectives and scope
• Description of relevant parts of the system and their functions
• The situation, system, or circumstances being assessed
• Risk criteria applied and their justification
• Assessment methodology
• Risk identification results
• Data, assumptions, and their sources and validation
• Risk analysis results and their evaluation
• Critical assumptions (including uncertainty analysis) and other 
factors that need to be monitored
• Discussion of results, and conclusions and recommendations
If the risk assessment supports a continuing risk management process, it 
should be performed and documented in such a way that it can be main￾tained throughout the life cycle of the system, organization, equipment, or 
activity. The assessment should be updated as significant new information 
becomes available and the context changes, in accordance with the needs 
of the management process.
RISK MONITORING AND 
EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW
Risk management should be an ongoing part of the quality management 
process. A mechanism for reviewing or monitoring events should be 
implemented. The output/results of the risk management process should 
be reviewed to take into account new knowledge and experience. Once a 
quality risk management process has been initiated, that process should 
continue to be used for events that might impact the original quality risk 
management decision whether these events are planned (for example, 
results of product review, inspections, audits, change control) or unplanned 
(for example, root cause from failure investigations, recall). The frequency 
of any review should be based on the level of risk. Risk review might 
include reconsideration of risk acceptance decisions previously taken.100  Chapter Four
As part of the risk management process, risks and controls should be 
monitored and reviewed on a regular basis to verify the following:
• Assumptions about risks remain valid
• Assumptions on which the risk assessment is based, including the 
external and internal context, remain valid
• Expected results are being achieved
• Results of risk assessment are in line with actual experience
• Risk assessment techniques are being properly applied
• Risk treatments are effective
Accountability for monitoring and performing reviews should be 
established as part of a formal procedure. The risk assessment process will 
highlight context and other factors that might be expected to vary over 
time and that could change or invalidate the risk assessment. These factors 
should be specifically identified for ongoing monitoring and review so 
the risk assessment can be updated when necessary. Data to be monitored 
to refine the risk assessment should also be identified and collected. 
The effectiveness of controls should also be monitored and documented 
to provide data for use in risk analysis. Accountabilities for creating and 
reviewing the evidence and documentation should be defined. Progress in 
implementing risk treatment plans provides a performance measure. The 
results can be incorporated into the organization’s overall performance 
management, measurement, and external and internal reporting activities. 
APPLICATION OF RISK ASSESSMENT 
DURING LIFE-CYCLE PHASES
Many activities, projects, and products can be considered to have a life 
cycle, starting from initial concept and definition through realization to 
final completion, which might include decommissioning and disposal of 
hardware. Risk assessment can be applied at all stages of the life cycle and 
is usually applied many times with different levels of detail to assist in 
the decisions that need to be made at each phase. Life-cycle phases have 
different requirements and need different techniques. For example, during 
the design and development phase, when an opportunity is identified, risk 
assessment may be used to decide whether to proceed or not. Where several 
options are available, risk assessment can be used to evaluate alternative 
concepts to help decide which provides the best balance of positive and 
negative risks.General Quality Risk Management Process  101
During the design and development phase, risk assessment contributes to:
• Ensuring that system risks are tolerable
• The cost-effectiveness studies
• Identifying risks impacting subsequent life-cycle phases
As the activity proceeds, risk assessment can be used to provide information 
to assist in developing procedures for normal and emergency conditions.
Risk management activities should begin as early as possible in the 
design and development phase, when it is easier to prevent problems, 
rather than correcting them later. For each identified hazard, the risk 
in both normal and fault conditions is estimated. In risk evaluation, the 
manufacturer decides whether risk reduction is needed. The results from 
this risk evaluation, such as the need for risk control measures, then become 
part of the design input. Risk control measures are part of the design output 
and are evaluated during design verification. This design input/output/
verification cycle will iterate and continue throughout the overall design 
control process until the residual risks have been reduced to an acceptable 
level and can be maintained at an acceptable level. The overall effectiveness 
of risk control measures is confirmed during design validation. Relying 
exclusively on design and development processes to control risk is not 
sufficient. Even the best design and development processes can fall short of 
ensuring error-free design output.
Once the medical product reaches the market, risk management 
activities should be linked to quality management processes, for example, 
production and process controls, CAPA, customer feedback, and servicing 
in the case of some medical devices.
ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT
All organizations should aim at the appropriate level of performance 
of their risk management framework in line with the criticality of the 
decisions that are to be made. The list of attributes below represents a high 
level of performance in managing risk. To assist organizations in measuring 
their own performance against these criteria, some tangible indicators are 
given for each attribute. Following is a list of attributes of enhanced risk 
management.
Continual Improvement
An emphasis is placed on continual improvement in risk management 
through the setting of organizational performance goals, measurement, 
review, and the subsequent modification of processes, systems, resources, 102  Chapter Four
capability, and skills. This can be indicated by the existence of explicit per￾formance goals against which the organization’s and individual manager’s 
performance is measured. There will be a periodic review of performance 
and then a revision of processes, and the setting of revised performance 
objectives for the following period. 
Full Accountability for Risks
Enhanced risk management includes comprehensive, fully defined, and 
fully accepted accountability for risks, controls, and risk treatment tasks. 
Designated individuals fully accept accountability, are appropriately 
skilled, and have adequate resources to check controls, monitor risks, 
improve controls, and communicate effectively about risks and their man￾agement to external and internal stakeholders. The organization ensures
that those who are accountable are equipped to fulfill that role by providing 
them with the authority, time, training, resources, and skills sufficient to 
assume their accountabilities.
Application of Risk Management in All Decision-Making
All decision-making within the organization, whatever the level of impor￾tance and significance, involves the explicit consideration of risks and the 
application of risk management to some appropriate degree. Soundly based 
risk management is seen within the organization as providing the basis for 
effective governance.
Continual Communications
Enhanced risk management includes continual communications with 
external and internal stakeholders, including comprehensive and frequent 
reporting of risk management performance, as part of good governance.
Full Integration in the Organization’s Governance Structure
Risk management is viewed as central to the organization’s management 
processes, such that risks are considered in terms of the effect of uncer￾tainty on objectives. The governance structure and process are based on the 
management of risk. Effective risk management is regarded by managers 
as essential for the achievement of the organization’s objectives.

Integration of 
Risk Management with
Quality Management
Quality risk management is a process that supports science-based 
and practical decisions when integrated into quality systems. 
As outlined in the introduction, appropriate use of quality risk 
management does not obviate industry’s obligation to comply with regu￾latory requirements. However, effective quality risk management can 
facilitate better and more informed decisions, can provide regulators with 
greater assurance of a company’s ability to deal with potential risks, and 
might affect the extent and level of direct regulatory oversight. In addition, 
quality risk management can facilitate better use of resources by regulators 
and manufacturers.
Training in quality risk management processes provides for greater 
understanding of decision-making processes and builds confidence in 
quality risk management outcomes. Quality risk management must be 
integrated into existing operations and documented appropriately. Chapter 
7 provides examples of situations in which the use of the quality risk 
management process might provide information that could then be used 
in a variety of medical product operations. A common understanding and 
application of quality risk management principles will facilitate mutual 
confidence and promote more-consistent decisions among different 
countries’ regulators on the basis of the same information. This collabo￾ration is a critical step in the development of global policies and guidelines 
that integrate and support quality risk management practices.
RISK MANAGEMENT PLANS
ISO 31073:2022 defines a risk management plan (RMP) as a “scheme 
within the risk management framework specifying the approach, the man￾agement components and resources to be applied to the management of 
103104  Chapter Five
risk.” Furthermore, it says that “management components typically include 
procedures, practices, assignment of responsibilities, sequence and timing 
of activities” and also that “the risk management plan can be applied to a 
particular product, process and project, and part or whole of the organi￾zation.” Risk management activities must be planned. Therefore, for the 
particular medical product being considered, the manufacturer must estab￾lish and document a risk management plan in accordance with the risk 
management process. The risk management plan must be part of the risk 
management file.
This plan must include at least the following:
a. The scope of the planned risk management activities, identifying 
and describing the medical product and the life-cycle phases for 
which each element of the plan is applicable
b. Assignment of responsibilities and authorities
c. Requirements for review of risk management activities
d. Criteria for risk acceptability, based on the manufacturer’s policy 
for determining acceptable risk, including criteria for accepting 
risks when the probability of occurrence of harm cannot be 
estimated
e. Method to evaluate the overall residual risk and criteria 
for acceptability of the overall residual risk based on the 
manufacturer’s policy for determining acceptable risk
f. Verification activities
g. Activities related to the collection and review of relevant 
production and post-production information.
If the plan changes during the life cycle of the medical product, a record of 
the changes must be maintained in the risk management file. Compliance 
is checked by inspection of the risk management file. The RMP can be a 
separate document or it can be integrated within other documentation, for 
example, within quality management system documentation. The makeup 
and level of detail for the plan should be commensurate with the level 
of risk associated with the medical product. The requirements identified 
below should be considered as the minimum requirements for an RMP. 
Manufacturers can include other items such as time schedule, risk analysis 
tools, or a rationale for the choice of specific risk acceptability criteria.Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  105
Scope of the Plan
The scope identifies and describes the medical product and the life-cycle 
phases for which each element of the plan is applicable. All elements of the 
risk management process should be mapped to the manufacturer’s defined 
product life cycle. Some of the elements of the risk management process 
will occur during the phases of the manufacturer’s established product 
realization process, such as design and development control. The remaining 
elements will occur during the other life-cycle phases through to product 
decommissioning. The risk management plan provides this mapping for 
a specific product either explicitly or by reference to other documents. 
Although all the risk management activities need to be planned, a manu￾facturer can have several plans covering different parts of the life cycle.
Assignment of Responsibilities and Authorities
The plan should identify the personnel with responsibility for the execution 
of specific risk management activities, for example, reviewers (including 
independent ones not directly involved in the process under evaluation), 
subject matter experts, and individuals with approval authority. 
Requirements for Review of 
Risk Management Activities
The plan should detail how and when these risk management reviews will 
occur for the specific medical product. The requirements for the review of 
risk management activities could be part of other quality system review 
requirements (for example, design and development review activities).
Criteria for Risk Acceptability
Criteria for risk acceptability (benefit-risk analysis) are derived from the 
manufacturer’s policy for determining acceptable risk. The criteria can 
be common for similar categories of medical product. Criteria for risk 
acceptability can be part of the manufacturer’s established QMS, which 
can be referenced in the plan. 
An important element when establishing criteria for risk acceptability 
is a benefit–risk determination. In the United States over the past several 
years, FDA has been taking steps to develop an enhanced, structured 
approach to benefit–risk assessment in regulatory decision-making for 
medical products, starting with human drugs, biologic products, and 106  Chapter Five
medical devices. This structured approach was named the benefit–risk 
assessment framework, and it is discussed in Chapter 7.
Verification Activities
The plan will specify how two distinct verification activities will be 
carried out. The first verification is required to demonstrate that the risk 
control measure has been implemented. The second verification is required 
to ensure that the implemented measure is effective (it actually reduces 
the risk). Verifying the effectiveness of risk control measures can require 
the collection of different types of data (manufacturing data, clinical data, 
usability studies in the case of medical devices, and so on). The plan can 
detail the verification activities explicitly or by reference to the plan for 
other verification activities.
Methods of Obtaining Relevant 
Post-Production Information
The method of obtaining post-production information can be part of 
established QMS procedures (for example, monitoring and measuring). 
Manufacturers must establish procedures to collect information from 
various sources such as medical staff, patients, service personnel, training 
personnel, incident reports, and customer feedback. While a reference 
to the QMS procedures can suffice in most cases, any product-specific 
requirements should be directly added to the risk management plan. The 
plan should include documentation of decisions, based on a risk analysis, 
about what sort of post-market surveillance is appropriate for the medical 
product, for example, whether reactive surveillance is adequate or whether 
proactive studies are needed. Pre- and post-market risks are discussed later 
in this chapter.
Example of Risk Management Plan Applied to 
Medication Guides
In many countries, special medicine safety plans are required as part of 
a medicine’s approval process and for maintenance of approval. These 
requirements are specified in such documents as:
• ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline Pharmacovigilance 
Planning—E2E (2004)
• The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Guidance on the format 
of the risk management plan (RMP) in the EU (2018)Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  107
• FDA Guidance for Industry—Development and Use of Risk 
Minimization Action Plans (RiskMAPs 2005), which in 2007 
evolved into a new statutorily-based safety plan called a Risk 
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).1
Under the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, FDA may require a REMS to 
be developed to ensure that the benefits of a medicine outweigh its risks. 
This could be required as part of the approval process for a new product 
or for an approved product when new safety information emerges. Some 
medicines that were previously approved with RiskMAPs are now deemed 
to have a REMS. A REMS is a strategy to manage a known or potential 
serious risk associated with a medicine.
Its purpose is to allow patients continued access to certain medicines 
for which there are safety concerns that may be managed through 
appropriate use. All REMSs must include a timetable for assessment of the 
REMS. 
A REMS may also include a medication guide or patient package 
insert and a communication to healthcare practitioners explaining elements 
to assure safe use of the product, such as:
• Special training or certification for healthcare professionals who 
prescribe or dispense the medicine
• Dispensing of the medicine only in certain settings (for example, in 
a hospital) or with evidence of safe use conditions
• Monitoring or registration of each patient using the medicine
Prior to the enactment of such legislation and regulations, pharmaceutical 
companies (recognizing that clinical studies do not necessarily represent 
“real-world” life experience) often designed RMPs in the preapproval 
stages of developing new medicines and have included them in submissions 
for approval. In Europe, risk management plans are now routinely required 
by EMA as part of the medicine approval process. An RMP includes a 
summary of important identified risks of the medicine, potential risks, 
and missing information. This summary incorporates the safety profile of 
the medicine at that time in its life cycle, either during preclinical testing, 
preapproval clinical development, or post-approval. The RMP specifies data 
on known and potential safety risks (drawn from preclinical and/or clinical 
study results for the medicine), as well as areas of risk that have not yet 
been studied or not studied extensively, such as specific (or larger) patient 
populations, patients with other medical conditions or in other treatment 
settings, and interactions with other medication. Pharmacovigilance and 108  Chapter Five
risk management activities that might be included in an RMP fall into two 
categories: 
a. Routine activities that would generally be conducted for any 
medicine at the same stage of development where no special 
safety concerns have arisen
b. Additional activities designed to address identified safety 
concerns
Routine pharmacovigilance would include the safety evaluations incor￾porated in clinical trials and the monitoring and reporting of spontaneous 
adverse events post-approval. Routine risk management activities would 
include ensuring that suitable warnings are included with all product 
information and careful labeling/packaging of the medicine. In an RMP 
the action plan might include calling for additional pharmacovigilance in 
the form of:
• Active surveillance (for example, medical records reviews, patient 
or physician interviews, prescription event monitoring, data from 
disease or drug exposure registries)
• Epidemiology studies (retrospective or prospective)
• Further clinical studies (specific safety studies, larger studies over 
longer periods)
• Drug utilization studies that describe how a drug is marketed, 
prescribed, and used in a specified population (often stratified by 
age, gender, concomitant medications, or other factors), and how 
these factors influence clinical, social, and economic outcomes
If the action plan specifies additional risk minimization activities, these 
could include:
• Additional educational material about the medicine and its use, 
such as patient information brochures, visual aids, physician 
prescribing guides/checklists, pharmacist dispensing guides/
checklists, healthcare provider letters, and so on.
• Training programs (patient- or physician-oriented).
• Restricted use of the medicine. For example, for use or dispensing 
only in a hospital or where specific equipment (for example, 
resuscitation equipment) is available, availability only in limited 
unit sizes, and so on.Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  109
RISK-BASED CAPA SYSTEM
The CAPA system2
 is a risk-based control mechanism. A well-designed 
and effectively implemented CAPA system provides a reliable source of 
quality data in a timely manner.
Risk management concepts have been part of the medical device world 
for many years. At first, the regulators used the term “hazard analysis,” 
and it was part of the HACCP methodology. For the last decade or so, 
HACCP terminology has been restricted to food safety, and FDA, ISO, 
and other regulators embraced the term risk analysis, which evolved to 
the current broader term of risk management. Risk analysis requirements 
are incorporated only into the design control (§820.30) element of FDA’s 
QSR, but the preamble of this regulation includes mentions about risk 
analysis expectations across many elements. The international standard 
(ISO 14971:2019) establishes risk management requirements to determine 
the safety of a medical device by the manufacturer during the product 
life cycle.
For other regulated products, such as drugs, the application of risk 
management concepts was more recently done in the form of an inter￾national guidance document, ICH Q9(R1) Quality Risk Management, 
which was adopted as a nonbinding guidance by the drug and biologic 
centers of FDA in June 2006 and revised in 2023.
Having in mind those risk management principles, typical questions 
must be answered: Do I need to document every deviation/nonconformity? 
Do I always need corrective and preventive actions? How soon must 
companies fix their CAPA problems? CAPA and risk management are two 
interlocked concepts that cannot be separated. All our decisions regarding 
CAPA must be filtered throughout the risk management system. Let’s now 
answer these questions.
Do I need to document every deviation or nonconformity? The answer 
is yes. Every time you detect some kind of “problem” it is necessary to 
look into it and document it. Repeating the primary concept of the CAPA 
system, continuous improvement requires analysis of the issue to discover 
its root cause before you can implement actions to prevent its reoccurrence. 
To be able to fix the cause of the problem, you must first discover its causes. 
Without some kind of investigation or evaluation, the probability is low that 
you can reach the real root causes. However, resources are not unlimited 
(actually, they are becoming more and more scarce) and, definitively, not 
all issues have the same significance. As the QSR preamble states, “at 
times a very in-depth investigation will be necessary, while at other times a 
simple investigation, followed by trend analysis or other appropriate tools, 110  Chapter Five
will be acceptable.” Therefore, you must prioritize, and risk assessment is 
one of the best tools you can use for this purpose. The significance of the 
product or quality issue can be evaluated by considering, for example, the 
criteria described in Table 5.1.
 Criterion Categories and examples
Does it have the • Critical or catastrophic: can cause death or 
potential for a patient significant disability to patient or user
or user safety issue? (contaminated injectable drug, critical drug

diagnoses)

Table 5.1 Continued.
Most regulated companies perform some kind of risk evaluation 
based on the frequency and the severity (importance, significance) of the 
event. Situations in which the frequency is rare and the severity is low 
may not require further investigation. Nevertheless, this evaluation must 
be documented. In other words, if you can demonstrate (with objective 
evidence) that the problem has low frequency and no significant danger, 
then you could pass on this investigation and focus your effort on more 
significant issues.
The biggest concern with this evaluation is that a vast majority of 
regulated companies focused the severity evaluation exclusively on the 
safety of the patient. Based on that evaluation, they assigned very low risk 
scores to deviations and nonconformances that represent major violations 
of cGMPs and therefore render such products as adulterated.
Do I always need corrective and preventive actions? If you inves￾tigated and discovered the root causes of a problem, it would be insane not 
to fix them. FDA’s position on this matter can be found in the preamble 
to the October 7, 1996, Medical Devices QSR. In comment 159 of the 
preamble, which relates to the degree of corrective or preventive actions, 
FDA states, “FDA cannot dictate in a regulation the degree of action that 
should be taken because each circumstance will be different, but FDA does 
expect the manufacturer to develop procedures for assessing the risk, the 112  Chapter Five
actions that need to be taken for different levels of risk, and how to correct 
or prevent the problem from recurring, depending on that risk assessment.”
A remarkable observation on this side of the CAPA system is that 
many companies always require both corrective and preventive actions, 
even in situations where no true preventive action can be applied. In some 
cases, the reason to require them is simply that the CAPA form includes 
both types of actions, and therefore, both are always required. 
How soon must companies fix their CAPA problems? The third 
question refers to the timeliness of failure investigations and corrective or 
preventive actions. Time frames for completing the different CAPA actions 
must be established based on the risk of the situation under investigation. 
This constitutes one of the biggest opportunities for improving CAPA 
systems. One simple approach used by several companies is to complete 
investigations (that is, the root cause investigation) in four weeks for low￾risk situations, three weeks for medium-risk situations, and two weeks for 
high-risk situations.
In the cases previously mentioned, risk classification is normally 
based on frequency and severity alone. Our recommendation is to use 
risk management criteria to determine how deeply and how quickly every 
nonconformance or deviation should be treated. These risk criteria must be 
clearly defined in written procedures. One example might be establishing 
who is responsible for evaluating product or quality issues and determining 
whether a failure investigation is necessary. Another example would be 
maintaining a record when no failure investigation is made, including the 
reason and the name of the individual responsible for the decision. The 
procedure should also determine the depth to which a failure investi￾gation is to be carried out and when an investigation should not pursue 
corrective action.
Table 5.2 depicts a simple way to carry out this task by segregating 
nonconformities and deviations into three categories based on the 
previously described risk criteria. For each situation, an overall risk score 
is determined by considering the worst-case scenario of the eight dimen￾sions under analysis. Check marks indicate the risk classification that 
is assigned to each dimension. For example, if the problem can have a 
critical or catastrophic impact on the safety of the patient, then its risk 
score must be high, independent of any other dimension such as product 
classification, problem detectability, and so on. Table 5.2 can be applied to 
processes and systems, including equipment failure where no product was 
directly affected.
Table 5.3 is an example of how to use this risk assessment score matrix 
for an issue affecting a class III medical device.Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  113

EXAMPLES OF INTEGRATION 
BETWEEN RISK MANAGEMENT AND 
OTHER QUALITY MANAGEMENT TOOLS
This section covers the following three examples of such integration: 
• The process analytical technology (PAT) approach
• Risk-based inspection site selection
• The quality system inspection technique (QSIT)Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  117
The Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Approach
FDA’s PAT (Food and Drug Administration 2004b) initiative is an effort 
to facilitate the introduction of new manufacturing technologies in the 
pharmaceutical industry for achieving more efficient processes. Process 
analytical technologies are systems that enhance process understanding 
and assist in identifying and controlling critical points in a process. These 
include appropriate measurement devices that can be placed at-, in-, or 
on-line; statistical and information technology tools; and a scientific 
systems approach for data analysis to control processes to ensure production 
of in-process materials and final products of desired quality.
PAT has been defined by FDA as a mechanism for designing, analyz￾ing, and controlling pharmaceutical manufacturing processes through the 
measurement of critical process parameters that affect critical quality 
attributes of the medical product. The PAT initiative is one of the elements 
within the broader FDA initiative of Pharmaceutical cGMPs for the 21st 
Century: A Risk-Based Approach. FDA has actively involved stakeholders 
in the development of this initiative. The goal of PAT is to understand 
and control the manufacturing process, which is consistent with the basic 
quality principle that quality cannot be tested into products; it should be 
built-in by design. Quality is built into pharmaceutical products through a 
comprehensive understanding of:
• The intended therapeutic objectives, patient population, route 
of administration, and pharmacological, toxicological, and 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of a drug
• The chemical, physical, and biopharmaceutic characteristics of 
a drug
• The design of a product and selection of product components and 
packaging based on drug attributes
• The design of manufacturing processes using principles of 
engineering, material science, and quality assurance to ensure 
acceptable and reproducible product quality and performance 
throughout a product’s shelf life
Using this approach of building quality into products, this guidance high￾lights the necessity for process understanding and opportunities for 
improving manufacturing efficiencies through innovation and enhanced 
scientific communication between manufacturers and the Agency. 
Increased emphasis on building quality into products allows more focus to 
be placed on relevant multifactorial relationships between material, manu￾facturing process, environmental variables, and their effects on quality. 118  Chapter Five
This enhanced focus provides a basis for identifying and understanding 
relationships between various critical formulation and process factors and 
for developing effective risk mitigation strategies (for example, product 
specifications, process controls, and training). The data and information 
useful in helping understand these relationships can be leveraged through 
preformulation programs and development and scale-up studies, as well as 
from improved analysis of manufacturing data collected over the life of 
a product.
Effective innovation in development, manufacturing, and quality assur￾ance would be expected to better answer questions such as the following:
• What are the mechanisms of degradation, drug release, and 
absorption?
• What are the effects of product components on quality?
• What sources of variability are critical?
• How does the process manage variability? 
The FDA initiative can facilitate innovation in development, manufacturing, 
and quality assurance by focusing on process understanding. These 
concepts are applicable to all manufacturing situations. A desired goal of 
the PAT framework is to design and develop processes that can consistently 
ensure a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process. Such 
procedures would be consistent with the basic tenet of quality by design 
and could reduce risks to quality and regulatory concerns while improving 
efficiency. Gains in quality, safety, and/or efficiency will vary depending 
on the product and are likely to come from:
• Reducing production cycle times by using on-, in-, and/or at-line 
measurements and controls
• Preventing rejects, scrap, and reprocessing
• Considering the possibility of real-time release
• Increasing automation to improve operator safety and reduce 
human error
• Facilitating continuous processing to improve efficiency and 
manage variability 
– Using small-scale equipment (to eliminate certain scale-up 
issues) and dedicated manufacturing facilities
– Improving energy and material use and increasing capacityIntegration of Risk Management with Quality Management  119
Risk-Based Inspection Site Selection
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act states that FDA is to inspect 
domestic drug manufacturing establishments at least once every two years 
(Food and Drug Administration 2004b). However, the Agency was unable to 
attain this statutory requirement mainly due to a lack of resources and a lack 
of an adequate prioritization tool. As part of the initiative Pharmaceutical 
cGMPs for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach, FDA began a risk￾based inspection pilot for prioritizing drug manufacturing establishments 
for routine inspection. The model was based on a risk-ranking and filtering 
method with the ultimate objective of making the best use of its limited 
surveillance and enforcement resources while maximizing the impact of 
those resources on public health.
Prioritizing sites for inspection has been a long-standing challenge 
for FDA managers. Typically, FDA district offices have identified specific 
sites in their geographical areas for inspection each year. These decisions 
were made based on a variety of informally applied factors, including, for 
example, a district manager’s knowledge of the inspectional history and 
corporate culture of the district, as well as the perceived risk to the public 
health of manufacturing errors.
Even before this initiative, FDA tried to use some kind of prioritization 
to better utilize inspectional resources. Three categories of facilities were 
identified as high priority for inspections: those that produce sterile drug 
products, those that produce prescription drugs, and new registrants that 
had not been inspected previously. Recognizing that FDA could not inspect 
every manufacturing site at equal frequency and depth with the present 
inspectional resources, a working group was created to develop a more 
rigorous risk-based approach to resource allocation for cGMP inspectional 
oversight. A risk-ranking and filtering model was developed for this task.
To develop the risk-ranking model for site selection, FDA followed 
a multistep analytical process like those described previously: hazard 
identification and conceptual modeling, risk estimation, and risk filtering. 
Hazard Identification and Conceptual Modeling. A two-step process 
was conducted: first, a wide range of factors that could be incorporated 
in the model (potential risk factors) were identified. Second, these factors 
were organized into principal, or top-level, components of the risk￾ranking model. A diverse group of FDA experts with experience in drug 
review, manufacturing controls, and inspections participated in a number 
of brainstorming sessions and a survey to identify potential risk factors. 
The general question posed of these experts was “In your experience, what 
are the principal factors important in predicting adverse impacts to drug 120  Chapter Five
quality?” Specific questions that the expert group considered, directly or 
indirectly, in identifying candidate risk factors included:
• What hazards (sources of harm) related to manufacturing can 
adversely impact drug quality attributes?
• What variables are associated with, or predictive of, those hazards?
• What processes and process parameters are critical for quality 
attributes?
• What factors may affect the identified hazards and critical 
parameters and processes?
• What factors are predictive of high- or low-quality manufacturing?
This process resulted in a list of more than 70 potential risk factors, 
of which some are potentially predictive (for example, batch sizes, 
dedicated lines, and so on) and others are directly relevant to quality and 
public health (for example, sterility or intrinsic toxicity). To develop the 
conceptual framework for the risk-ranking model, these factors needed 
to be hierarchically organized according to their level of generality and 
causal relationships. By direct observation, several FDA experts organized 
the list of risk factors into broad categories, or top-level components, of 
product, process, and facility (see Table 5.4).

Table 5.4 Top-level components for the site selection model.Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  121
The construct for a risk-based site selection model was developed 
based on the above modeling framework. Under this construct, a site risk 
potential (SRP) is a function of the weighted risk potentials for each of the 
three categories: product, facility, and process. The risk potential for each 
top-level component is, in turn, a function of select potential risk factors. 
Thus, an SRP score is derived by a mathematical combination of weights or 
ranks assigned to select potential risk factors. The assignment of weights or 
ranks to select potential risk factors is based on either empirical evidence, 
expert judgment, or a combination of both. To calculate the SRP score, 
weights and rankings for individual potential risk factors are numerically 
discrete values (for example, 0.1, 1, 2, 3, 6).
Implementation of the Model and Risk Estimation. The selection of 
potential risk factors within each top-level component (product, facility, 
and process) and their weight assignments have significant influence on 
the SRP score. When implementing the risk-ranking model, it is important 
that the assignment of a weight or rank to each potential risk factor is 
based on empirical evidence and on systematic and transparent collection, 
and analyses of expert judgments. Many potential risk factors that were 
initially identified by the FDA expert group were excluded from the 
current implementation of the model because of lack of data or other data 
limitations, including difficulties in linking data elements with specific 
manufacturing sites and differing data dictionaries among various existing 
databases. The current iteration of the Agency’s pilot risk-ranking model 
includes the elements depicted in Figure 5.3.

Product Component. Table 5.5 depicts the two types of factors in the 
product component of the model.
Process Component. It is clear that some processes are more complex and 
more susceptible to problems than other processes. It was further recog￾nized that one primary goal of the cGMP inspections is to ensure that 
processing operations are in a state of control. Thus, consensus among 
FDA experts was that it would be important to include process-related risk 
factors in the risk-ranking model. Based on the working group deliberation, 
two types of process-related factors were identified for inclusion in the 
survey and subsequently the risk-ranking model:
• Factors associated with maintaining process control
• Factors associated with potential vulnerability to product or 
environmental contamination
2. Past recalls for
quality defects
FDA human drug recall data 
provide information on past recalls
for quality defects with potential for
human health hazard. 
The data were analyzed based on
product types (for example, routes 
of administration and dosage 
forms). Using a likelihood and 
severity matrix, weights were
assigned to product types based 
on frequency of recall and health
hazard severity (class I, II, and III).
Product types with a high
frequency of recall and high
hazard severity (type of recall)
were given higher weights.
1. Intrinsic factors
Factors such as sterility, medical gas,
and the determination of prescription 
(Rx) versus over-the-counter (OTC) were
used to distinguish between products 
with higher and lower potential for public
health consequence should there be
a drug defect.
For example, the current model 
assumes that if there is a quality defect, 
sterile drugs would have a higher public 
health consequence than non-sterile
drugs; hence, sterile drugs are given a 
higher weight.
In addition, the current model considers
sites manufacturing specific products 
where there is a heightened risk of
cross-contamination, such as sites 
manufacturing highly sensitizing agents
(for example, antibiotics) and at least 
one other product using similar 
processing methods.
Table 5.5 Product component factors.Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  123
The survey was designed to elicit from appropriate FDA experts a risk￾ranking (for example, from high to low) of the probability of loss of a state 
of control and, independently, the vulnerability of the process to contami￾nation for a product category and processing operations associated with 
that product category. 
Experts were surveyed on risks associated with commonly employed 
manufacturing operations (for example, measuring, mixing, compression, 
and filling) and for a variety of product categories (for example, immediate￾and modified-release solid oral drugs, sterile liquids, metered-dose inhalers, 
and active ingredients produced by chemical and fermentation processes). 
Survey results were statistically analyzed, and process control and con￾tamination weights were assigned to each product category identified in 
the expert elicitation survey. 
Facility Component. The facility component of the risk-ranking model 
includes four factors:
1. History of violation (for example, cGMP deficiencies have 
higher weights)
2. History of inspection (for example, no prior inspection, newly 
registered/licensed, or no cGMP inspection in the past two years 
have higher weights than those with recent cGMP inspection)
3. Estimated volume of production output (surrogate for exposure, 
for example, higher volume and production output, higher weights)
4. Type of establishment (for example, manufacturer, repacker, 
contract lab)
These factors were identified from existing FDA databases and assigned 
weights using an ordinal scale similar to the product and process factors. 
Most of the factors are self-explanatory.
Risk Filtering and Model Summary. To test the robustness of the risk￾ranking model, FDA conducted a pilot analysis of an inventory of more 
than 1,500 facilities. The pilot ranking, based on the historical data as 
described above, showed that the model could adequately spread the SRP 
score for filtering and that the distribution of the SRP scores was only 
slightly skewed. In the current iteration, the risk-ranking model will lead to 
a ranked list of sites for routine cGMP inspection coverage such that a site’s 
chance of being selected for inspection will increase if it:
• Has not been inspected recently (or ever)
• Has a higher production volume124  Chapter Five
• Has a history of significant violations
• Makes products associated with a high frequency of recalls, 
particularly for serious defects
• Uses processes expected to have a greater potential for cross￾contamination and/or loss of a state of control
• Makes sterile and/or prescription drugs
This model does not exclude any site or product type from being potentially 
selected as a high-priority site. It is expected that sites with effective 
quality systems and superior process understanding will be less likely to 
have a history of significant violations or have multiple product recalls, and 
such sites would, generally, be expected to have less frequent or intense 
inspectional coverage than would otherwise be the case. Similarly, sites 
that have successfully implemented risk mitigation techniques would likely 
have a better inspectional history and fewer recalls. Individual risk factor 
weights and final scoring information, as well as specific information used 
to generate the weights and scores, were intentionally not provided by FDA 
in order to be able to effectively enforce the law.
The Quality System Inspection Technique (QSIT)
Once the QSR was issued in 1996, FDA created a team to reengineer the 
inspection process used by the agency to perform quality system/good 
manufacturing practice inspections at medical device manufacturing 
facilities. The new inspection technique was called the quality system 
inspection technique (QSIT) (Food and Drug Administration 1999a). The 
QSIT approach to inspections was derived from the theory that there are 
seven subsystems in the QSR (21 CFR, Part 820). Four primary areas 
were chosen on which to focus the inspection: management controls, 
design controls, corrective and preventive actions (CAPA), and production 
and process controls. The remaining three subsystems are covered via 
“linkages” within the QSIT guide. This document provides guidance for 
inspecting medical device manufacturers against the QSR (21 CFR, Part 
820) and related regulations.
Satellite programs are included in the QSIT due to their correlation in 
the inspection process with the related subsystem. The CAPA subsystem 
is the logical “jumping-off” point to begin inspecting for medical device 
reporting, corrections and removals, and medical device tracking programs 
that relate to a firm’s post-market activities. Rather than check every 
aspect of the firm’s quality system, the so called “top-down” subsystem Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  125
approach focuses on those elements that are most important in meeting 
the requirements of the QSR and that are key quality indicators. Between 
six and 15 inspectional objectives are provided for the review of each 
subsystem. The review includes both a (broad) review of whether the firm 
has procedures in place and appears to meet the requirements and a closer 
(detailed) review of some records to verify that the requirements have been 
implemented in actual production, design, and daily quality assurance 
situations. This document represents an extraordinary benchmark, advising 
companies where to align their internal audit programs.
The QSIT guide provides guidance to FDA field staff on a new inspec￾tional process that may be used to assess a medical device manufacturer’s 
compliance with the QSR and related regulations. Field investigators may 
conduct an efficient and effective comprehensive inspection using this 
guidance material, which will help them focus on key elements of a firm’s 
quality system. The Guide to Inspections of Quality Systems provides 
instructions for conducting medical device quality system/GMP inspec￾tions. It is to be used in conjunction with the compliance program entitled 
Inspection of Medical Device Manufacturers (7382.845).
The subsystem approach is designed to provide the inspector with the 
key objectives that can help determine a firm’s state of compliance. The 
process was designed to account for the time constraints placed on field 
investigators when performing device quality system inspections. If FDA 
can focus inspection effort on key elements of a firm’s quality system, both 
the inspector and the manufacturer can benefit from a more efficient and 
effective evaluation of that quality system.
When an inspector begins an inspection by looking at one or more 
instances of quality problems, such as nonconforming device reports, and 
works his/her way back through the firm’s quality system, you are under 
a “bottom-up” inspection. This method has been helpful in zeroing in 
on specific problems and evaluating the firm’s actions relating to those 
problems. However, with the “top-down” approach, FDA is looking at 
the firm’s “systems” for addressing quality before the inspector actually 
looks at specific quality problems. In the top-down approach, the inspector 
“touches bottom” in each of the subsystems by sampling records rather than 
working his/her way from records review backward toward procedures.
The top-down approach begins each subsystem review with an 
evaluation of whether the firm has addressed the basic requirements in 
that subsystem by defining and documenting appropriate procedures. 
This is followed by an analysis of whether the firm has implemented the 
requirements of that subsystem. The quality system was divided into seven 
subsystems, along with related satellite programs. Based on discussions 126  Chapter Five
between the device industry and the Agency, four major subsystems that 
are the basic foundation of a firm’s quality system were chosen. Those four 
major subsystems are management control, corrective and preventive action 
(CAPA) (with satellite medical device reporting, corrections and removals, 
and medical device tracking), design controls, and production and process 
controls (P&PC) (with satellite sterilization process controls).
The duration of inspection is related to the depth of the inspection. The 
guide was designed to accomplish a complete review of all four subsystems 
in approximately one week. While the length of each inspection will vary, 
using key inspectional objectives will help assure that every inspector 
looks at the most important elements of the firm’s quality system during 
the inspection.
Most device firms are inspected more than once. By probing different 
subsystems, devices, or processes each time, FDA will eventually have 
covered most of the firm’s quality system. You are not expected to cover 
everything in the firm and in the narrative each time. You are expected to 
evaluate the firm’s quality system but also do it in an efficient and focused 
manner. Thus, you should limit the depth of coverage when necessary 
to meet the time frame suggested. As a general rule of thumb, one day 
should be sufficient to cover each subsystem when using the top-down 
approach described within this document. In practice, you may find that 
the inspection of a certain subsystem may take half a day, while another 
may take one-and-a-half days. This situation would still reflect an overall 
one day per subsystem time frame.
PRE- AND POST-MARKET RISKS
Regulatory expectations are that manufacturers of medical products apply 
good risk assessment practices during the whole life cycle of their products. 
Risk opportunities are everywhere, and using a life-cycle approach enables 
manufacturers to better understand the risks and hazards associated with 
their products and, more importantly, how to mitigate those risks. Life cycle 
includes all phases in the life of the product, from the initial development, 
through marketing, until the product’s discontinuation.
U.S. FDA does not have a uniform approach to pre- and post-market 
risk assessments across all lines of product that the Agency regulates. 
Following is an excerpt of main guidances promulgated by U.S. FDA for 
drug/biological and medical device products.Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  127
Drug and Biological Products
FDA’s safety assessment of medicines does not diminish after drugs are 
approved for marketing. Although the pre-market phase of study is very 
intensive, much work remains to monitor approved drugs over time. 
No drug is risk-free, and it is not uncommon for new information to be 
discovered after a drug is on the market and being used by larger numbers 
of patients. Such information helps provide a better picture of drug risks, 
enables FDA to give healthcare professionals and patients the latest 
information on potential or newly identified risks, and strengthens FDA’s 
ability to safeguard patients against unacceptable risks. On June 12, 2002, 
Congress reauthorized, for the second time, the Prescription Drug User 
Fee Act (PDUFA III). In the context of PDUFA III, FDA agreed to satisfy 
certain performance goals. One of those goals was to produce guidance for 
industry on risk management activities for drug and biological products. 
FDA published the following three final guidances in March 2005:
1. Premarketing Risk Assessment (Pre-marketing guidance) 
2. Development and Use of Risk Minimization Action Plans 
(RiskMAP Guidance) 
3. Good Pharmacovigilance Practices and Pharmacoepidemiologic 
Assessment (Pharmacovigilance guidance) 
Each of the three final guidance documents focuses on one aspect of risk 
management. The pre-marketing guidance and the pharmacovigilance 
guidance focus on pre-marketing and post-marketing risk assessment, 
respectively. The RiskMAP guidance focuses on risk minimization. 
Together, risk assessment and risk minimization form what FDA calls risk 
management. Specifically, risk management is an iterative process of:
1. Assessing a product’s benefit–risk balance
2. Developing and implementing tools to minimize its risks 
while preserving its benefits
3. Evaluating tool effectiveness and reassessing the 
benefit–risk balance 
4. Making adjustments, as appropriate, to the risk minimization 
tools to further improve the benefit–risk balance
This four-part process should be continuous throughout a product’s life 
cycle, with the results of risk assessment informing the sponsor’s decisions 
regarding risk minimization.128  Chapter Five
Risk management is an iterative process designed to optimize the 
benefit–risk balance for regulated products. Risk assessment consists of 
identifying and characterizing the nature, frequency, and severity of the 
risks associated with the use of a product. Risk assessment occurs through￾out a product’s life cycle, from the early identification of a potential product, 
through the pre-marketing development process, and after approval during 
marketing. 
Pre-marketing risk assessment represents the first step in this process, 
and this guidance focuses on risk assessment prior to marketing. It is critical 
to FDA’s decision on product approval that a product’s underlying risks and 
benefits be adequately assessed during the pre-marketing period. Sponsors 
seeking approval must provide from the clinical trials a body of evidence 
that adequately characterizes the product’s safety profile. This guidance 
provides general recommendations for assessing risk. The adequacy of 
the assessment of risk is a matter of both quantity (ensuring that enough 
patients are studied) and quality (the appropriateness of the assessments 
performed, the appropriateness and breadth of the patient populations 
studied, and how results are analyzed). This guidance also addresses the 
qualitative aspects of risk assessment.
Although risk assessment continues through all stages of product 
development, this guidance focuses on risk assessment during the later 
stages of clinical development, particularly during phase 3 studies. The 
guidance is not intended to cover basic aspects of preclinical safety assess￾ments (for example animal toxicity testing) or routine clinical pharma￾cology programs. Good clinical risk assessment in the later stages of drug 
development should be guided by the results of comprehensive preclinical 
safety assessments and a rigorous, thoughtful clinical pharmacology 
program (including elucidation of metabolic pathways, identification of 
possible drug–drug interactions, and determination of any effects from 
hepatic and/or renal impairment). These issues are addressed in other FDA 
guidances, as well as guidances developed under the auspices of the ICH.
Risk assessment during product development should be conducted in 
a thorough and rigorous manner; however, it is impossible to identify all 
safety concerns during clinical trials. Once a product is marketed, there 
is generally a large increase in the number of patients exposed, including 
those with comorbid conditions and those being treated with concomitant 
medical products. Therefore, post-marketing safety data collection and 
risk assessment based on observational data are critical for evaluating and 
characterizing a product’s risk profile and for making informed decisions 
on risk minimization.
The pharmacovigilance guidance focuses on pharmacovigilance 
activities in the post-approval period. This guidance uses the term Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  129
pharmacovigilance to mean all scientific and data-gathering activities 
relating to the detection, assessment, and understanding of adverse events. 
This includes the use of pharmacoepidemiologic studies. These activities 
are undertaken with the goal of identifying adverse events and under￾standing, to the extent possible, their nature, frequency, and potential 
risk factors. 
Pharmacovigilance principally involves the identification and evalu￾ation of safety signals. In this guidance document, safety signal refers 
to a concern about an excess of adverse events compared to what would 
be expected to be associated with a product’s use. Signals can arise from 
post-marketing data and other sources, such as preclinical data and events 
associated with other products in the same pharmacologic class. It is 
possible that even a single well-documented case report can be viewed 
as a signal, particularly if the report describes a positive rechallenge or if 
the event is extremely rare in the absence of drug use. Signals generally 
indicate the need for further investigation, which may or may not lead to 
the conclusion that the product caused the event. After a signal is identified, 
it should be further assessed to determine whether it represents a potential 
safety risk and whether other action should be taken.
Medical Devices
FDA recognizes that there are risks associated with every medical device 
on the market. At the time of device approval, certain safety and effec￾tiveness questions may not be fully resolved due to significant obstacles, 
such as the time and cost involved to address possible rare adverse events 
or long-term safety issues, and because controlled clinical studies do not 
fully represent the benefit–risk profile of a device when used in real￾world clinical practice. Getting the right balance between pre-market and 
post-market data collection (specifically, where appropriate, a greater 
reliance on post-market collection) can reduce the extent of pre-market 
data submission and directly impact when patients will have access to 
high-quality, safe, and effective medical devices. But, greater reliance on 
post-market data collection could undermine patient safety if the necessary 
and timely data collection does not occur.
FDA has long applied post-market controls as a way to reduce 
pre-market data collection, where appropriate, while assuring that the statu￾tory standard for approval of reasonable assurance of safety and effective￾ness is still met. 
An ample discussion on this topic is found on FDA’s guidance 
Balancing Premarket and Postmarket Data Collection for Devices 
Subject to Premarket Approval issued on April 13, 2015. This guidance 130  Chapter Five
provides a resource for industry and FDA staff on how FDA determines 
when it is appropriate for manufacturers (mainly, sponsors of a PMA) to 
collect some data (clinical or nonclinical) in the post-market setting, rather 
than pre-market. 
FDA believes that applying post-market controls to reduce pre-market 
data collection, when appropriate, improves patient access to safe and 
effective medical devices that are important to public health. As discussed 
in this guidance, there are certain circumstances where FDA may consider 
it acceptable to collect certain data in the post-market setting, rather than 
pre-market. FDA applies careful post-market monitoring to support the 
continued safety and effectiveness of the device. 
Post-market data collection is a factor FDA considers as a part of 
making benefit–risk determinations. FDA may consider the collection of 
post-market data as a way to clarify the magnitude and effect of mitigations 
or as a way to develop additional information regarding benefits or risks 
for certain device types or in specific patient populations when making a 
benefit–risk determination. As part of FDA’s benefit–risk determination, 
one of the factors that FDA considers is the degree of certainty of the 
probable benefits and probable risks of a device in the Agency’s review of a 
PMA application. FDA states that: 
There is never 100% certainty when determining reasonable 
assurance of safety and effectiveness of a device or any other 
medical product. However, the degree of certainty of the benefits 
and risks of a device is a factor FDA considers when making 
benefit–risk determinations.
FDA recognizes that medical device approvals are not made with absolute 
certainty due to significant obstacles, such as the time and cost involved 
to address possible rare adverse events or long-term safety, and because 
clinical studies do not fully represent how a device will be used in 
clinical practice. 
When making a determination of whether it is appropriate to collect 
certain data in the post-market setting, rather than pre-market, FDA 
considers, among other factors, the device’s potential impact on public 
health. FDA may approve a device with a greater degree of uncertainty 
regarding the benefits and risks of the device if this uncertainty is 
sufficiently balanced by other factors, including the probable benefits of 
the device and the extent of post-market controls.
As discussed in the following, during the review of a PMA, FDA may 
consider it acceptable to collect certain data in the post-market setting, 
rather than pre-market, under certain circumstances when FDA has uncer￾tainty regarding certain benefits or risks of the device but less uncertainty Integration of Risk Management with Quality Management  131
about the overall benefit–risk profile of the device at the time of pre-market 
approval. For example, uncommon or minor risks raised prior to PMA 
approval may, in appropriate instances, be addressed post-market; assessing 
the long-term benefit–risk profile of the device may also be deferred to the 
post-market phase. In addition, in cases where FDA has robust experience 
with the device type—typically a more mature technology—there may be 
less uncertainty about probable risks and benefits of the device, and FDA 
may leverage such experience to defer some data collection to the post￾market setting. 
However, many concerns have been raised about lowering pre-market 
standards and emphasizing post-market data even though the draft guid￾ance admits that “Greater reliance on post-market data collection could 
undermine patient safety if the necessary and timely data collection does 
not occur.”

Methodologies
and Tools
Quality risk management supports a scientific approach to decision￾making. It provides documented and reproducible methods for 
accomplishing steps of the quality risk management process 
based on current knowledge about assessing the severity, probability, and 
detectability of the risk. Traditionally, the medical product industry and 
regulators have been assessing and managing risk in a variety of informal 
ways based on, for example, compilation of observations, trends, and other 
information. Such approaches continue to provide useful information 
that might support topics such as handling of complaints, quality defects, 
deviations, and allocation of resources.
Quality risk management methods and the supporting statistical tools 
can be used in combination (for example, probabilistic risk assessment). 
Combined use provides flexibility that can facilitate the application of 
quality risk management principles. These techniques can be comple￾mentary, and it may be necessary to use more than one of them. The basic 
principle is that the chain of events is analyzed step by step. The degree 
of rigor and formality of quality risk management should reflect available 
knowledge and be commensurate with the complexity and/or criticality of 
the issue under evaluation. 
SELECTION AND TYPES OF
RISK ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES
Risk assessment may be undertaken in varying degrees of depth and detail 
and using one or several methods ranging from simple to complex. The 
form of assessment and its output should be consistent with the risk criteria 
133134  Chapter Six
developed as part of establishing the context. In general terms, a suitable 
technique should have the following characteristics:
• It should be justifiable and commensurate to the situation under 
consideration.
• It should provide results in a form that enhances understanding of 
the nature of the risk and how it can be treated.
• It should be capable of being used in a manner that is traceable, 
repeatable, and verifiable.
Once the decision has been made to perform a risk assessment, and the 
objectives and scope have been defined, the techniques should be selected 
based on applicable factors, such as:
• Objectives of the study.
• Type and range of risks being analyzed.
• The potential magnitude of the consequences. The decision on the 
depth to which risk assessment is carried out should reflect the 
initial perception of consequences (although this may have to be 
modified once a preliminary evaluation has been completed).
• Degree of expertise and resources needed. A simple method 
well done may provide better results than a more sophisticated 
procedure poorly done as long as it meets the objectives and scope 
of the assessment. The effort put into the assessment should be 
consistent with the potential level of risk being analyzed.
• Regulatory or contractual requirements.
Various factors influence the selection of an approach to risk assessment, 
such as the availability of resources, the nature and degree of uncertainty 
in the data and information available, and the complexity of the application. 
Information regarding those factors is included later in this chapter under 
each specific technique. 
Availability of Resources
Several factors related to available resources and capabilities that may 
affect the choice of risk assessment techniques include:
• The skills, experience, capacity, and capability of the risk 
assessment team
• Constraints on time and other resources within the organization
• The budget available if external resources are requiredMethodologies and Tools  135
The Nature and Degree of Uncertainty
The nature and degree of uncertainty requires an understanding of the 
quality, quantity, and integrity of information available concerning the 
risk under consideration. This includes the extent to which sufficient 
information is available regarding the risk, its sources and causes, and its 
consequences. Uncertainty can stem from poor data quality or the lack of 
essential and reliable data. Uncertainty can also be inherent in the external 
and internal context of the organization.
Available data do not always provide a reliable basis for the prediction 
of the future. For unique types of risks or for new product types, historical 
data may not be available or there may be different interpretations of 
available data by different stakeholders (industry and regulators, for 
example). Those undertaking risk assessment need to understand the 
type and nature of the uncertainty and appreciate the implications for 
the reliability of the risk assessment results. These should always be 
communicated to decision-makers.
Complexity
Risks can be complex in themselves, as, for example, in complex systems 
that need to have their risks assessed across the system rather than treating 
each component separately and ignoring interactions. In other cases, 
treating a single risk can have implications elsewhere and can impact 
other activities. Consequential impacts and risk dependencies need to be 
understood to ensure that in managing one risk an intolerable situation is 
not created elsewhere. Understanding the complexity of a single risk or of 
a portfolio of risks of an organization is crucial for the selection of the 
appropriate method or techniques for risk assessment.
APPLICATION OF RISK ASSESSMENT 
DURING LIFE-CYCLE PHASES
Many activities, projects, and products can be considered to have a life 
cycle starting from initial concept and definition through realization to 
final completion, which might include removal of the medical product 
from the market. Risk assessment can be applied at all stages of the life 
cycle and is usually applied many times with different levels of detail to 
assist in the decisions that need to be made at each phase.
Life-cycle phases have different needs and require different tech￾niques. For example, during the concept and definition phase, when an 136  Chapter Six
opportunity is identified, risk assessment may be used to decide whether to 
proceed or not. Where several options are available, risk assessment can be 
used to evaluate alternative concepts to help decide which provides the best 
balance of risks. During the design and development phase, risk assessment 
contributes to ensuring that system risks are tolerable and to identifying 
risks impacting subsequent life-cycle phases.
RISK ASSESSMENT
TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS
Basic Risk Management Facilitation Methods
Some of the simple techniques that are commonly used to structure risk 
management (Tague 2005) by organizing data and facilitating decision￾making are discussed next. 
Flowcharts/Process Mapping. A flowchart is a picture that describes the 
steps of a process in sequential order. It is useful when trying to understand 
how a process is really being done. Unfortunately, many companies do not 
have flowcharts of their processes. When trying to solve a problem, it is a 
good idea to spend some time walking through the process and comparing 
how things are actually done (the real process) with how they should be 
done (the theoretical process required by applicable working instructions). 
Flowcharts are easy-to-understand diagrams showing how steps in a 
process fit together. This makes them useful tools for communicating how 
processes work and for clearly documenting how a particular job is done. 
Furthermore, the act of mapping a process in flowchart format helps you 
clarify your understanding of the process and helps you think about where 
the process can be improved.
Flowcharts are simple diagrams that map out a process so it can 
easily be communicated to other people. To draw a flowchart, brainstorm 
the tasks and decisions made during a process and write them down in 
order. Then map these out in flowchart format using appropriate symbols 
for the start and end of a process, actions to be taken, and decisions to 
be made. Finally, challenge your flowchart to make sure it’s an accurate 
representation of the process and that it represents the most efficient way 
of doing the job. This tool must be the first step in any risk assessment 
methodology. Methodologies and Tools  137
Strengths
• Flowcharts are one of the best ways to understand a process.
• They are also a good way of communicating the logic of a 
system to stakeholders.
• Problems can be analyzed in a more effective way.
• Flowcharts help in debugging processes.
Limitations
• Sometimes, a flowchart becomes very complex.
• If alterations are required, the flowchart may require redrawing 
completely.
• The essentials of what is done can easily be lost in the 
technical details of how it is done.
Brainstorming. The term “brainstorming” is often used very loosely to 
mean any type of group discussion. Brainstorming involves stimulating and 
encouraging free-flowing conversation among a group of knowledgeable 
people to identify potential failure modes and associated hazards, risks, 
criteria for decisions, and/or options for treatment. However, true brain￾storming involves particular techniques to try to ensure that people’s 
imaginations are triggered by the thoughts and statements of others in 
the group.
Effective facilitation is very important in this technique and includes 
stimulation of the discussion at kickoff, periodic guiding of the group into 
other relevant areas, and capture of the issues arising from the discussion. 
Brainstorming can be used in conjunction with other risk assessment 
methods (for example cause-and-effect diagram, fault tree analysis, and so 
on) described below or may stand alone as a technique for encouraging 
imaginative thinking at any stage of the risk management process and any 
stage of the life cycle of a system. Brainstorming places a heavy emphasis 
on imagination. It is therefore particularly useful when identifying risks 
of new technology, where there are no data, or where novel solutions to 
problems are needed.
Strengths
• Encourages imagination, which helps identify new risks and 
novel solutions.
• Involves key stakeholders and hence aids communication
overall.
• Relatively quick and easy to set up.138  Chapter Six
Limitations
• Participants may lack the skill and knowledge to be effective 
contributors.
• Since it is relatively unstructured, it is difficult to demonstrate 
that the process has been comprehensive, for example, that all 
potential risks have been identified.
• There may be particular group dynamics where some people
with valuable ideas stay quiet while others dominate the 
discussion. This can be overcome by anonymous computer 
brainstorming, using a chat forum, or nominal group technique.
Checklists. Checklists are lists of hazards, risks, or control failures 
that have usually been developed from experience, either as a result of a 
previous risk assessment or of past failures. A checklist can be used to 
identify hazards and risks or to assess the effectiveness of controls. They 
can be used at any stage in the life cycle of a product, process, or system. 
They may be used as part of other risk assessment techniques, but they are 
most useful when applied to check that everything has been covered after a 
more imaginative technique that identifies new problems has been applied.
Strengths
• May be used by nonexperts.
• If well designed, they combine wide-ranging expertise with an
easy-to-use system.
• Can help ensure that common problems are not forgotten.
Limitations
• Tend to inhibit imagination in the identification of risks.
• Address the “known” part of the situation, not the “unknown.”
• Encourage “tick the box” type behavior.
• Tend to be observation based, so miss problems that are not 
readily seen.
Delphi Method. The Delphi method (Linstone and Turoff 1975) is a 
structured communication technique, originally developed as a systematic, 
interactive forecasting method that relies on a panel of experts. Although 
the term is often now broadly used to mean any form of brainstorming, Methodologies and Tools  139
an essential feature of the Delphi method, as originally formulated, was 
that experts expressed their opinions individually and anonymously while 
having access to the other experts’ views as the process progresses. The 
name “Delphi” derives from the Oracle of Delphi. The authors of the 
method were not happy with this name, because it implies “something 
oracular, something smacking a little of the occult.” The Delphi method 
is based on the assumption that group judgments are more valid than indi￾vidual judgments.
In the standard version, the experts answer questionnaires in two 
or more rounds. After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous 
summary of the experts’ forecasts from the previous round as well as the 
reasons they provided for their judgments. Thus, experts are encouraged to 
revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of their 
panel. It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will 
decrease and the group will converge toward the “correct” answer. Finally, 
the process is stopped after a predefined criterion (for example, the number 
of rounds, achievement of consensus, stability of results), and the mean or 
median scores of the final rounds determine the results.
The Delphi method is based on the principle that forecasts (or 
decisions) from a structured group of individuals are more accurate 
than those from unstructured groups. This has been described using 
the term “collective intelligence.” The Delphi method has been widely 
used for business forecasting and has certain advantages over another 
structured forecasting approach, prediction markets. The Delphi method 
was developed at the beginning of the Cold War to forecast the impact 
of technology on warfare. In 1944, General Henry H. Arnold ordered the 
creation of a report for the U.S. Army Air Corps on the future technological 
capabilities that might be used by the military. Different approaches were 
tried, but the shortcomings of traditional forecasting methods—such as the 
theoretical approach, quantitative models, or trend extrapolation—in areas 
where precise scientific laws have not been established yet quickly became 
apparent. The Delphi method was developed during the 1950s and 1960s 
by Olaf Helmer, Norman Dalkey, and Nicholas Rescher. Experts were 
asked to give their opinion on the probability, frequency, and intensity of 
possible enemy attacks. Other experts could anonymously give feedback. 
This process was repeated several times until a consensus emerged.140  Chapter Six
Strengths
• As views are anonymous, unpopular opinions are more likely 
to be expressed.
• All views have equal weight, which avoids the problem of
dominating personalities.
• Achieves ownership of outcomes.
• People do not need to be brought together in one place at
one time.
Limitations
• It is labor-intensive and time-consuming.
• Participants need to be able to express themselves clearly
in writing.
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
Within the medical product manufacturing setting, few tools are more 
appropriate than the failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) (Inter￾national Electrotechnical Commission 2006). In one of its guidances for 
industry (Q9(R1) Quality Risk Management), FDA summarizes some of 
the most common risk management tools. Among those tools, they include 
the FMEA establishing that:
FMEA provides for an evaluation of potential failure modes for 
processes and their likely effect on outcomes and/or product 
performance. Once failure modes are established, risk reduction 
can be used to eliminate, contain, reduce, or control the potential 
failures. FMEA relies on product and process understanding. 
FMEA methodically breaks down the analysis of complex 
processes into manageable steps. It is a powerful tool for 
summarizing the important modes of failure, factors causing 
these failures, and the likely effects of these failures. (Food and 
Drug Administration 2023a)
Furthermore, it mentions that FMEA can be used to prioritize risks and 
monitor the effectiveness of risk control activities. Besides its definition 
and areas of application, the guide does not provide a methodology to carry 
out an effective FMEA. For that reason, a systematic approach is needed. 
That approach will consist of three interrelated tools: the process map, the 
cause-and-effect matrix (prioritization matrix), and the FMEA.
FMEA is an analysis technique that facilitates the identification of 
potential problems in the design or process by examining the effects of Methodologies and Tools  141
lower-level failures. Recommended actions or mitigation provisions are 
made to reduce the likelihood of the problem occurring and mitigate the 
risk if, in fact, it does occur.
FMEA or FMECA? The FMEA determines the effect of each failure mode 
and identifies single failure points that are critical. It may also rank each 
failure according to the criticality of a failure effect and its probability 
of occurring. Therefore, the failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis 
(FMECA) is the result of two steps:
• Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)
• Criticality analysis (CA)
FMECA is just FMEA with criticality analysis, and they are often used 
interchangeably. From now on, when I use the acronym FMEA I am 
referring to both FMEA and FMECA. There are many different flavors of 
FMEAs. They are inductive techniques using the question, “What happens 
if . . . ?” Elements of the process (for example, components) are analyzed 
one at a time, thus generally looking at a single-fault condition. This is 
done in a “bottom-up” mode, for example, following the procedure to the 
next higher functional system level.
FMEA provides for an evaluation of potential failure modes of 
processes and their likely effect on outcomes and/or product performance. 
Once failure modes are established, risk reduction can be used to eliminate, 
contain, reduce, or control the potential failures, thus creating preventive 
actions to minimize risks.
FMEA relies on product and process understanding. It methodically 
breaks down the analysis of complex processes into manageable steps. It 
is a powerful tool for summarizing the important modes of failure, factors 
causing these failures, and the likely effects of these failures. FMEA can 
be used to prioritize risks and monitor the effectiveness of risk control 
activities. FMEA can be applied to equipment and facilities and might 
be used to analyze a manufacturing operation and its effect on product or 
process. It identifies elements/operations within the system that render it 
vulnerable. The output/results of FMEA can be used as a basis for design 
or further analysis, or to guide resource deployment.
FMEA application in the medical product industry can be utilized for 
failures and risks associated with manufacturing processes; however, it is 
not limited to this application. The output of an FMEA is a relative risk 
“score” for each failure mode, which is used to rank the modes on a relative 
risk basis. FMEA can provide input into other analysis techniques such as 
fault tree analysis at either a qualitative or quantitative level.142  Chapter Six
Strengths
• Provides a basis for identifying potential root causes and 
developing effective preventive actions.
• Identifies reliability/safety-critical components. It is widely
applicable to human, equipment, and system failure modes and 
to hardware, software, and procedures.
• Provides a foundation for other maintainability, safety, testability,
and logistics analyses.
• Identifies component failure modes, their causes, and their 
effects on the system and presents them in an easily
readable format.
• Avoids the need for costly equipment modifications in service
by identifying problems early in the design process.
• Identifies single-point failure modes and requirements
for redundancy or safety systems. Provides input to the 
development monitoring programs by highlighting key 
features to be monitored.
Limitations
• It is difficult to deal with redundancies and the incorporation
of repair or preventive maintenance actions, as well as its
restriction to single-fault conditions.
• It can only be used to identify single failure modes, not 
combinations of failure modes.
• FMEA/FMECA studies can be time-consuming and costly.
• FMEA/FMECA studies can be difficult and tedious for complex,
multi-layered systems.
The FMEA Process. FMEAs need information about the elements of the 
system in sufficient detail to conduct meaningful analysis of the ways in 
which each element can fail. Information may include:
• A flowchart of the process or system being analyzed and its 
components
• An understanding of the function of each step of the process or 
component of the system
• Details of environmental and other operational parameters that may 
affect operation
• An understanding of the results of particular failures
• Historical data on failures, including failure rate data (if available), 
which will allow determination of the probability of failureMethodologies and Tools  143
There are several ways this may be done. The most common method 
used in the regulated industry to classify each of the identified failure 
modes according to its criticality is the risk priority number (RPN), 
which is a semiquantitative measure of criticality obtained by multiplying 
numbers from rating scales (usually between 1 and 10) for consequence 
(severity) of failure, likelihood of occurrence of failure, and ability to detect 
the problem. A failure is given a higher priority if it is difficult to detect. 
Once potential failure modes and mechanisms are identified, preventive 
actions can be defined and implemented for the more significant ones.
The FMEA process is depicted in Figure 6.1.

The primary output of FMEA/FMECA is a list of potential failure

of failure). Information is also given on the causes of failure and the 
consequences to the system as a whole, and the detectability of the failure 
mode. See Figure 6.2 for an example of FMEA output.144  Chapter Six What is

Appendix C contains a case study using FMEA. Chapter 8 discusses 
some pitfalls when using FMEA as the only risk management tool.
Fault Tree Analysis
Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a type of analysis in which a failure is 
analyzed using Boolean logic (and/or) to combine a series of lower-level 
events (causal factors) until you reach their root causes (Tague 2005). This 
analysis method was originally developed to quantitatively determine 
the probability of a safety hazard in the field of safety engineering. FTA 
provides a method of breaking down chains of failures. A key addition 
permits the identification of combinations or interactions of events that 
cause other failure events (see example in Figure 6.3). There are two types 
of interaction:
a. Several items must fail together to cause another item to fail 
(“AND” combination)
b. Only one of a number of possible events must happen to cause 
another item to fail (“OR” combination)
The AND and OR symbols are called gates. They prevent the failure event 
above them from occurring unless their specific conditions are met. When 
several factors must happen simultaneously (AND relationship), you can 
avoid the failure simply by controlling one of them (the easiest or the 
cheapest). When any of several causal factors can create the failure, then 
you must fix all of them.
The tree is constructed working backward from a known event or 
failure and asking why it happened. The answer will represent the factor 
that directly caused the failure. Continuing with the why questioning will 
allow us to reach fundamental events or root causes. In other words, FTA 
is a very good tool to help us understand how an event occurred. It is best 
used when working with complex issues with several interrelated causes 
of failure.
FTA is a deductive, top-down approach to failure mode analysis 
aimed at analyzing the possible causes of an undesired event or failure. 
This contrasts with FMEA, an inductive, bottom-up analysis method aimed 
at analyzing the effects of single-component or single-function failures 
on equipment or systems. In terms of the CAPA system, you can define 
FTA as a reactive investigation tool (the failure already happened). FMEA 
should, ideally, be used proactively (during the design phase of a process) 
to anticipate failure modes and generate preventive actions.146  Chapter Six

FTA is a technique for identifying and analyzing factors that can 
contribute to a specified undesired event (called the “top event”). In a 
deductive manner, starting with the top event, the possible causes or fault 
modes of the next lower functional system level causing the undesired 
consequence are identified. The factors identified in the tree can be events 
that are associated with component hardware failures, human errors, or any 
other pertinent events that lead to the undesired event.
FTA can be used to establish the pathway to the root cause of the 
failure. FTA can be used to investigate complaints or deviations in order 
to fully understand their root cause and ensure that intended improvements 
will fully resolve the issue and not lead to other issues (solve one problem 
yet cause a different problem). FTA is an effective tool for evaluating how 
multiple factors affect a given issue. The output of an FTA includes a visual Methodologies and Tools  147
representation of failure modes. It is useful both for risk assessment and in 
developing monitoring programs.
Strengths
• It is a disciplined approach that is highly systematic but at the 
same time sufficiently flexible to allow analysis of a variety of
factors, including human interactions. The “top-down” approach
focuses attention on those effects of failure that are directly
related to the top event.
• FTA is especially useful for analyzing systems with many
interfaces and interactions.
• The pictorial representation leads to an easy understanding 
of the system behavior and the factors included, but as the 
trees are often large, processing of fault trees may require 
computer systems.
• Logic analysis of fault trees is useful in identifying simple
failure pathways in a very complex system where particular
combinations of events that lead to the top event could 
be overlooked.
Limitations
• Uncertainties in the probabilities of base events are included 
in calculations of the probability of the top event. This can 
result in high levels of uncertainty where base event failure
probabilities are not known accurately; however, a high degree 
of confidence is possible in a well-understood system.
• In some situations, causal events are not bound together, and 
it can be difficult to ascertain whether all important pathways
to the top event are included.
• The fault tree is a static model; time interdependencies are 
not addressed.
• Fault trees can only deal with binary states (failed/not failed).
• While human error modes can be included in a qualitative 
fault tree, in general, failures of degree or quality, which often 
characterize human error, cannot easily be included.
• A fault tree does not enable domino effects or conditional
failures to be included easily.
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)
HACCP is a systematic, proactive, and preventive tool for assuring product 
quality, reliability, and safety (World Health Organization 2003). It is 148  Chapter Six
a structured approach that applies technical and scientific principles to 
analyze, evaluate, prevent, and control the risk or adverse consequences of 
hazards due to the design, development, production, and use of products.
Traditionally, the HACCP methodology has been considered to be a 
food safety management system. It aims to prevent known hazards and to 
reduce the risk that they will occur at specific points in the food chain. The 
same principles are also increasingly being applied in other industries, such 
as the auto, aviation, chemical, and medical product industries. Hazards 
affecting quality are controlled to a certain extent through the validation 
of critical operations and processes in the manufacture of medical products 
in accordance with applicable cGMP. However, cGMP does not cover the 
safety of the personnel engaged in manufacture, while both aspects are 
covered by HACCP. Safety hazards are common in the manufacture of 
active pharmaceutical ingredients and will require special precaution and 
control measures.
Procedures, including cGMP, address operational conditions and 
provide the basis for HACCP. HACCP is a systematic method for the 
identification, assessment, and control of safety hazards. Such hazards 
are defined as biological, chemical, or physical agents or operations that 
are reasonably likely to cause illness or injury if not controlled. In the 
manufacture of pharmaceuticals, these may include the manufacture of 
certain antibiotics, hormones, cytotoxic (carcinogenic) substances, or other 
highly active pharmaceuticals, together with operations such as fluid-bed 
drying and granulation, which are examples of hazard unit operations in 
the pharmaceutical manufacturing arena. The use of inflammable solvents 
(solutions) and certain laboratory operations may also constitute hazards. 
HACCP might be used to identify and manage risks associated with 
physical, chemical, and biological hazards (including microbiological 
contamination). HACCP is most useful when product and process 
understanding is sufficiently comprehensive to support identification of 
critical control points. The output of a HACCP analysis is risk management 
information that facilitates monitoring of critical points not only in the 
manufacturing process but also in other life-cycle phases. The intent of 
HACCP is to help prevent known hazards and to reduce the risk that they 
will occur at any point in a process through the execution of seven core 
principles, which are described in Figure 6.4.
The heart of an effective HACCP system focuses on the continuing 
control and monitoring of the identified hazards (principles 2, 3, and 4). 
A manufacturer demonstrates the effectiveness of established control 
measures (principles 5 and 6) by establishing methodically documented 
process mapping, process hazard analysis, and a critical control plan 
(principle 7). Methodologies and Tools  149

Figure 6.4 HACCP principles.
Developing a HACCP Plan. There are a total of 12 tasks required in 
developing a HACCP plan, and these are designed to ensure that the seven 
principles are applied correctly. Principle 1, which is to conduct a hazard 
analysis, requires that the first five tasks have all been addressed in a logical 
and honest manner so all real hazards associated with the commodity have 
been identified. The 12 tasks are discussed briefly below.
Task 1—Establish a HACCP Team. To fully understand the commodity 
system and be able to identify all likely hazards and CCPs, it is important 
that the HACCP team is made up of people from a wide range of disciplines. 150  Chapter Six
The team should include appropriate personnel, including a team leader to 
convene the group and to direct the work of the team, ensuring that the 
concept is properly applied. This person must be familiar with the tech￾nique, be a good listener, and allow all participants to contribute. The first 
activity of the HACCP team is to identify the scope of the study. This will 
make the task more manageable, and specialists can be added to the team 
as and when they are required.
Task 2—Describe the Product. To start a hazard analysis, a full description 
of the product, including customer specifications, should be prepared. 
This should include information relevant to safety, regulation/target level, 
composition, and physical/chemical properties of the raw materials and the 
final product. Also, information regarding how the product is to be pack￾aged, stored, and transported should also be considered together with facts 
regarding its shelf life and recommended storage temperatures. Where 
appropriate, labeling information and an example of the label should be 
included. This information will help the HACCP team identify real hazards 
associated with the process.
Task 3—Identify the Product’s Intended Use. How the product is 
intended to be used is an important consideration. Information on whether 
the product will be consumed directly, or be cooked (in the case of food), 
or be further processed will all have a bearing on the hazard analysis (see 
task 6). The nature of the target group (customers/patients) for the product 
may also be relevant, particularly if it includes susceptible groups such 
as infants, the elderly, or pregnant women. The likelihood of misuse of a 
product should also be considered. This information can be recorded on the 
same form as the product description.
Task 4—Draw Up the Process Flow Diagram. The first function of the 
team is to draw up a detailed flow diagram of the process or system, or that 
part of it that is relevant.
Task 5—On-Site Confirmation of Flow Diagram. Upon completion 
of the flow diagram, members of the team should visit the process (for 
example, warehouse or manufacturing area) to compare the information 
present on the flow diagram with what actually happens in practice. This 
is known as “walking the line,” a step-by-step practice to check that all 
information regarding materials, practices, controls, and so on have 
been taken into consideration by the team during the preparation of the 
flow diagram. 
Task 6—Identify and Analyze Hazard(s)—(Principle 1). Effective 
hazard identification and hazard analysis are the keys to a successful Methodologies and Tools  151
HACCP plan. All real or potential hazards that may occur in each ingredient 
and at each stage of the commodity system should be considered. Safety 
hazards for HACCP programs have been classified into three types:
1. Biological. Typically, microbiological, viral, or parasitic 
contamination with pathogens.
2. Chemical. Cross-contamination situations due to raw material 
or finished product mix-ups are a common (and very dangerous) 
situation in medical product manufacturing.
3. Physical. Contaminants such as broken glass, hair, pieces of 
clothes or gloves, metal fragments, insects, or stones.
The probability that a hazard will occur is called a risk. The risk may take 
a value from zero to one depending on the degree of certainty that the 
hazard will be absent or that it will be present. After hazard identification, 
a hazard analysis must be conducted to understand the relative health 
risk to man or animal posed by the hazard. It is a way of organizing and 
analyzing the available scientific information on the nature and size of the 
health risk associated with the hazard. The risk may have to be assessed 
subjectively and simply classified as low, medium, or high. Only those 
hazards considered by the HACCP team to present an unacceptable risk of 
being present are taken forward to principle 2.
Once a safety hazard has been identified, appropriate control measures 
should be considered. These are any action or activity that can be used 
to control the identified hazard such that it is prevented, eliminated, or 
reduced to an acceptable level.
Task 7—Determine the Critical Control Points (CCPs)—(Principle 
2). Each step in the flow diagram, within the scope of the HACCP study, 
should be taken in turn, and the relevance of each identified hazard should 
be considered. It is also important to remember the stated scope of the 
HACCP analysis at this stage. The team must determine whether the 
hazard can occur at this step, and if so, whether control measures exist. If 
the hazard can be controlled adequately, is not best controlled at another 
step, and is essential for process safety, then this step is a CCP for the 
specified hazard. A decision tree can be used to determine CCPs. However, 
the HACCP team’s judgment, expertise, and knowledge of the process are 
the major factors in establishing CCPs. If a step is identified where a safety 
hazard exists but no adequate control measures can be put in place either 
at this step or subsequently, then there is a high-risk situation that must be 
attended to immediately.152  Chapter Six
Task 8—Establish Critical Limits for Each CCP—(Principle 3). Critical 
limits must be specified and validated for each CCP. Criteria often used 
include measurements of process parameters such as product concentration. 
In the case of food safety, temperature, cooking time, moisture level, pH, 
water activity, and sensory parameters such as visual appearance are often 
used. All critical limits, and the associated permissible tolerances, must be 
documented in the HACCP plan worksheet and included as specifications 
in operating procedures and work instructions.
Task 9—Establish a Monitoring Procedure—(Principle 4). Monitoring 
is the best mechanism for confirming that critical limits at each CCP 
are being met. The method chosen for monitoring must be specific and 
have enough sensitivity to produce a meaningful result that is detectable 
with available monitoring equipment. This is imperative so corrective 
action can be taken as quickly as possible so loss of product will be 
avoided or minimized. Monitoring can be carried out by observation or 
by measurement of samples taken in accordance with a statistically based 
sampling plan. Monitoring by visual observation is basic but gives rapid 
results, and can therefore be acted on quickly. 
Task 10—Establish Corrective Action—(Principle 5). If monitoring 
indicates that critical limits are not being met (the process is out of control) 
corrective action must be taken immediately. The corrective action should 
take into account the worst-case scenario but must also be based on the 
assessment of hazards, risk, and severity, and on the final use of the 
product. Corrective actions must ensure that the CCP has been brought 
back under control. They must also include appropriate disposition of any 
affected product. Whenever possible, an alarm system should be introduced 
that will activate when monitoring indicates that the critical limit is being 
approached. Preventive actions can then be applied to prevent the need for 
any product disposition.
Task 11—Verify the HACCP Plan—(Principle 6). Once the HACCP 
plan has been drawn up and all the CCPs have been validated, the complete 
plan must be verified. Once the HACCP plan is in routine operation, it 
must be verified and reviewed at regular intervals. The appropriateness of 
CCPs and control measures can thus be determined, and the extent and 
effectiveness of monitoring can be verified. Ways in which the system can 
be verified include:
• Collecting samples for analysis by a method different from the 
monitoring procedure (asking questions of staff, especially 
CCP monitors)
• Observing operations at CCPs (audit of the process)Methodologies and Tools  153
Task 12—Keep Records—(Principle 7). Record keeping is an essential 
part of the HACCP process. It demonstrates that the correct procedures 
have been followed from the start to the end of the process, offering product 
traceability. It provides a record of compliance with the critical limits set 
and can be used to identify problem areas. Usually, full compliance with 
this task is not a problem for the highly regulated medical product industry. 
Strengths
• HACCP is a highly structured process that provides
documented evidence for quality control as well as identifying
and reducing risks.
• Emphasis on control, not detection.
• Better risk control throughout the process rather than relying 
on final product inspection.
• Allows the identification of hazards introduced through human 
actions and how these can be controlled at the point of 
introduction or subsequently.
Limitations
• Requires comprehensive process understanding—not ideally
suited for little-known hazards or processes.
• Does not quantify or prioritize risks.
• Does not quantify impact of additional controls on reducing risk.
• Appropriate controls need to be defined.
Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP)
HAZOP is the acronym for hazard and operability analysis and is a struc￾tured and systematic examination of a planned or existing product, process, 
procedure, or system. It is a technique used to identify risks to people, 
equipment, environment, and/or organizational objectives. The HAZOP 
technique was initially developed to analyze chemical process systems, but 
it has since been extended to other types of systems and also to complex 
operations and to software systems.
HAZOP is similar to an FMEA. It is a systematic technique for identi￾fying hazards and operability problems. While the use of HAZOP studies 
in the chemical industry focuses on deviations from design intent, there are 
alternative applications for a medical product developer.154  Chapter Six
A HAZOP can be applied to the operation/function of a medical device 
or to a process used in the manufacture or maintenance/service of medical 
products (for example, sterilization) that can have a significant impact on 
the function of a product. It can also be applied to manufacturing processes, 
including outsourced production and formulation, as well as the upstream 
suppliers, equipment, and facilities for pharmaceutical products. It has also 
been used primarily in the pharmaceutical industry for evaluating process 
safety hazards. Very similar to the HACCP, the output of a HAZOP 
analysis is a list of critical operations for risk management. This facilitates 
regular monitoring of critical points in the manufacturing process.
There are several types of HAZOP:
• Process HAZOP. Originally developed to assess plants and 
process systems
• Human HAZOP. Focused on human errors rather than 
technical failures
• Procedure HAZOP. Review of procedures or operational sequences
• Software HAZOP. Identification of possible errors in the 
development of software
HAZOP is a technique for identifying potential hazards in a system and 
identifying operability problems likely to lead to nonconforming products. 
HAZOP is based on a theory that assumes risk events are caused by 
deviations from design or operating intentions. This tool has a unique and 
distinctive feature, which is that such deviations are facilitated by using 
sets of “guide words” as a systematic list of deviation perspectives. It is 
generally carried out by a multidisciplinary team during a set of meetings 
where those guide words are applied, in turn, to all the process parameters 
in order to identify unexpected and yet credible deviations from the design/
process intent. The assumption is that 
Guide word + Parameter → Deviation
Figure 6.5 presents a list of the most commonly used guide words.
HAZOP guide words are key supporting elements in the execution of a 
HAZOP analysis. According to IEC Standard 61882:
The identification of deviations from the design intent is achieved 
by a questioning process using predetermined “guide words.” The 
role of the guide word is to stimulate imaginative thinking, to 
focus the study, and elicit ideas and discussion. Methodologies and Tools  155

Strengths
• Involves a simple and intuitive tool within a multidisciplinary 
team environment.
• Generates solutions and risk treatment actions.
• Applicable to a wide range of systems, processes, and 
procedures.
• Allows consideration of the causes and consequences of
human error.
Limitations
• Detailed analysis can be very time-consuming and therefore 
expensive.
• Discussion can be focused on detail issues of design, and not on
wider or external issues.
• The process relies on the expertise of the designers, who may 
find it difficult to be sufficiently objective to seek problems in
their designs.
Cause-and-Effect Analysis
Cause-and-effect analysis is a structured method for identifying possible 
causes of an undesirable event or problem (Rodríguez-Pérez 2022). It 
organizes the possible contributory factors into broad categories so all 
possible hypotheses can be considered. It does not, however, by itself point 
to the actual causes, since these can only be determined by real evidence 
and empirical testing of hypotheses. The information is organized in either 
a cause-and-effect diagram (also called a fishbone diagram or Ishikawa 
diagram) or sometimes a tree diagram. Cause-and-effect diagrams are 
used to analyze and find the root cause of a certain effect or problem. They 
are also known as fishbone diagrams because their shape is similar to a 
fish skeleton. Cause-and-effect diagrams are considered one of the seven 
basic tools of quality management.
The cause-and-effect diagram focuses on the causes rather than 
the effects. Because there may be a number of causes for a particular 
problem, this tool helps us to identify the root cause of the problem in an 
uncomplicated manner. This tool allows brainstorming in a structured 
format similar to an affinity diagram, where potential causes are grouped 
into logical categories such as materials, manpower, methods, machines, 
environment, and so on. Potential causes can be further tracked back to Methodologies and Tools  157
the root cause using the 5 Whys technique. Another way to do this is to 
examine the problem using typical categories known as the 5Ms and 1E:
• Manpower. Anyone involved with the process 
• Methods. How the process is performed and the specific 
requirements for doing it, such as policies, procedures, instructions, 
and regulations
• Machines. Any equipment, computers, or tools required to 
accomplish the task 
• Materials. Raw materials, parts, and components used to produce 
the final product 
• Measurements. Data generated from the process that are used to 
evaluate it 
• Environment. Environmental conditions such as humidity and 
temperature and the culture in which the process operates

5 Whys
One of the most useful tools in science is why. As an investigator, you 
are searching for the true causes of your problems. If you don’t know the 
cause, you cannot implement corrective action. Remember the definition 
of corrective action: action to avoid the recurrence of root causes. There 
are plenty of root cause analysis tools available to you, most of them more 
complicated to understand than your problem, but all of them are based on 
the word why.
The best way to find your way from the symptoms to the root causes is 
to ask why until the nature of your problem and its solution become clear. 
This tool (the 5 Whys) is attributed to Sakichi Toyoda, one of the founders 
of the Toyota Company.
Why five? It is postulated that five iterations is generally sufficient to 
get to a root cause. My recommendation is that you keep asking why until a 
fixable root cause is found. 
The technique is very simple to use. Using a cross-functional teamwork 
environment:
• Agree on a problem statement (effect). Brainstorm the major 
categories of causes of the problem, or use the six generic headings.
• Brainstorm all the possible causes of the problem. Ask, “Why does 
this happen?” As each idea is given, the facilitator writes it as a 
branch from the appropriate category. Causes can be written in 
several places if they relate to several categories.
• Again ask, “Why does this happen?” about each cause. Write 
subcauses branching off the causes. Continue to ask “Why?” and 
generate deeper levels of causes. Layers of branches indicate causal 
relationships.
• When the group runs out of ideas, focus attention on places on the 
chart where ideas are few.

Strengths
• Involvement of applicable experts working in a team
environment.
• Structured analysis.
• Consideration of all likely hypotheses.
• Graphical, easy-to-read illustration of results.
• Helps to identify areas where further data are needed.
• Can be used to identify contributory factors to wanted as well 
as unwanted effects.160  Chapter Six
Limitations
• The team may not have the necessary expertise.
• It is not a complete process in itself and needs to be a part of a 
root cause analysis to produce recommendations.
• It is a display technique for brainstorming rather than a separate
analysis technique.
• Interactions between the categories may not be considered 
adequately.
Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)
PHA is a simple, inductive method of analysis whose objective is to identify 
the hazards and hazardous situations and events that can cause harm for a 
given activity, facility, or system. It is most commonly carried out early in 
the development of a product or process, when there is little information 
on design details or operating procedures, and can often be a precursor to 
further studies or to provide information for specification of the design of 
a system. 
The tool consists of: 
1. Identification of the possibilities that the risk event happens
2. Qualitative evaluation of the extent of possible injury or damage 
to health that could result
3. A relative ranking of the hazard using a combination of severity 
and likelihood of occurrence
4. Identification of possible remedial measures 
The results obtained can be presented in different ways such as tables 
and trees.
Strengths
• Can be used when there is limited information.
• Allows risks to be considered very early in the system life cycle.
Limitations
• Provides only preliminary information.
• It is not comprehensive; nor does it provide detailed information 
on risks and how they can best be prevented.Methodologies and Tools  161
Risk Ranking and Filtering
Risk ranking and filtering is a tool for comparing and prioritizing (ranking) 
risks (see Food and Drug Administration 2004b). Risk ranking of complex 
systems typically involves evaluation of multiple diverse quantitative 
and qualitative factors for each risk. The tool involves breaking down a 
basic risk question into as many components as needed to capture factors 
involved in the risk. These factors are combined into a single relative risk 
score that can then be used for ranking risks. “Filters,” in the form of 
weighting factors or cutoffs for risk scores, can be used to scale or fit the 
risk ranking to management or policy objectives.
Risk ranking (represented in Figure 6.8) and filtering (represented in 
Figure 6.9) can be used to prioritize manufacturing sites for inspection/
audit by regulators or industry. Risk ranking methods are particularly 
helpful in situations in which the portfolio of risks and the underlying 
consequences to be managed are diverse and difficult to compare using 
a single tool. Risk ranking is useful for management in evaluating both 
quantitatively assessed and qualitatively assessed risks within the same 
organizational framework.

evaluation criteria.
• Difficult to correlate results with absolute risk.
Supporting Statistical Tools
Statistical tools can support and facilitate quantitative quality risk manage￾ment. They can enable effective data assessment, aid in determining the 
significance of the data set(s), and facilitate more-reliable decision-making. 
The list of statistical tools commonly used in the FDA-regulated industry 
can be very extensive. Among the main tools are:
• Control charts
– Acceptance control charts (see ISO 7966)
– Control charts with arithmetic average and warning limits (see 
ISO 7873)Methodologies and Tools  163
– Cumulative sum charts (see ISO 7871)
– Shewhart control charts (see ISO 8258)
– Weighted moving average
• Design of experiments (DOE)
• Histograms
• Pareto charts
• Process capability analysis
There are hundreds of very good statistical books. Process Monitoring 
and Improvement Handbook, second edition (2019) by Manuel E. Peña￾Rodríguez, published by ASQ Quality Press, is an excellent reference for 
these topics.1

Practical Applications of 
Quality Risk Management 
to the Life Science 
Manufacturing Industry
This chapter is intended to identify potential uses of quality risk man￾agement principles and tools by industry and regulators. However, 
the selection of risk management tools is completely dependent on 
specific facts and circumstances. These examples are provided for illustra￾tive purposes and only suggest potential uses of quality risk management. 
Appendices A and C contain several examples of specific applications 
within the FDA-regulated environment.
MANAGEMENT
Risk management is a very important and critical process within a quality 
management system. Practically all major activities carried out by a medical 
product company must pass through the filter of risk management, from the 
prioritization of investigations when deviations occur, to the schedule and 
calendar for internal and supplier audit. It is difficult to imagine one area 
or department where the risk management process does not apply. Today, 
risk management is a standard and accepted quality system practice used 
by industry and regulators to facilitate good decision making about risk 
identification, resource prioritization, and risk mitigation or elimination, 
as appropriate. Even FDA is developing a modern risk-based medical 
product quality assessment system that focuses on critical product quality 
attributes and how they relate to the safety and effectiveness of those 
medical products.
Management of medical product companies must use risk management 
to review current interpretations and application of regulatory expectations. 
Following is a brief discussion of eight of these areas. 
165166  Chapter Seven
Internal Audit
Risk management tools can be used to define the frequency and scope of 
internal audits. The overall administration of the internal audit program 
is the responsibility of the quality unit. The quality unit is responsible for 
evaluating site operations and systems to identify the scope, frequency, and 
resources necessary to support an effective internal audit program as well as 
to determine the effectiveness of the conducted audits. It is a common practice 
to periodically audit every department (manufacturing, packaging, quality, 
training, warehouse, and so on) according to a predetermined schedule, 
and without using any of the many advantages that risk management/
prioritization would provide.
For example, you can use risk ranking and filtering techniques to 
create a risk score for each department or quality system element under the 
internal audit program. I do recommend considering factors such as:
• Impact of the department/quality system element related to 
providing safe and effective products to your customer
• Compliance status and regulatory history of the department/element
• Results of previous audits/inspections
• Major changes since the last audit (for example, a new process 
introduced in the area, large turnover of personnel, and so on)
• CAPA system indicators (nonconformities, recalls, or complaints 
related to the area, and so on)
One element of auditing where risk management techniques are very often 
used is the classification of each audit finding and observation based on 
risk. Typically, the outcome of the audit and each individual finding/obser￾vation are classified using scores such as the following:
• Critical
• Major
• Minor
Training
Training is one of the most important elements of an effective and efficient 
quality system. Companies must provide adequate training resources. FDA 
regulations as well as international standards (for example ISO 13485:2016 
or ICH Q10) refer to “competency” of those human resources in terms of 
education, training, inherent skills, and work experience. 
.	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  167
Training provides skills and/or knowledge to adequately perform a job. 
Personnel should be qualified to do the operations that are assigned to them 
in accordance with the nature of, and potential risk of, their operational 
activities. On the other hand, managers should define appropriate qualifi￾cations for each position to help ensure that individuals are assigned appro￾priate responsibilities. Personnel should also understand the effect of their 
activities on the product and the customer. Job descriptions should include 
requirements such as scientific and technical knowledge, process and prod￾uct knowledge, and/or risk assessment abilities to appropriately execute 
certain functions.
Continued training is critical to ensure that the employees remain 
proficient in their operational functions. Typical training should cover the 
policies, processes, procedures, and written instructions related to opera￾tional activities, the product/service, the quality system, and the desired 
work culture. Training should focus on both the employees’ specific job 
functions and the related regulatory requirements. Managers are expected 
to establish training programs that include the following:
• Evaluation of training needs
• Provision of training to satisfy these needs
• Evaluation of the effectiveness of training
• Documentation of training and/or retraining
Risk assessment techniques must be used to determine the appropriateness 
of initial and/or ongoing training sessions based on the education, experi￾ence, and working habits of staff, as well as on a periodic assessment of 
previous training (for example, its effectiveness). Also, it is crucial to iden￾tify the training, experience, qualifications, and physical abilities that allow 
personnel to perform an operation reliably and with no adverse impact on 
the quality of the product. Therefore, the job description for each position 
within a medical product manufacturing plant must be developed using 
risk management techniques. 
Even though training efforts are generally considered as part of the 
basic foundation of the quality system, cost reduction efforts, often tied 
to outsourcing activities, are hitting this critical area very hard. Many of 
the quality disasters related to medical products can be linked to poor or 
ineffective training efforts. Within this industry, training departments are 
being dismantled everywhere, or at least reduced to their minimal expres￾sion. Training dollars are seen as a cost instead of as an investment, and 
this is not just an offshoring problem. Local outsourcing activities within 
the United States and Western Europe are largely based only on cost 168  Chapter Seven
reduction considerations, and training efforts are second to none during 
cost-cutting activities. An example of the use of risk analysis as part of the 
training program can be found in Falce (2015).
Error Risk Reduction1
According to a recent report published in the British Medical Journal, 
medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States, 
right after heart disease and cancer, causing at least 250,000 deaths every 
year, indicating that patient safety efforts fall far short. In other words, 10 
percent of U.S. deaths are due to preventable medical mistakes (Makary 
and Daniel 2016).
For many years we considered human errors or mistakes the cause 
of a mishap or problem. Human error, under whatever label (procedures 
not followed, lack of attention, or simply error), was the conclusion of 
the investigation. Very often it was coupled with some kind of training 
activity (most frequently retraining) as corrective action. We even have 
an old adage—“To err is human”—to explain it. Human errors cannot be 
eliminated or even significantly reduced simply by telling operators to be 
more careful. This simplistic approach does not work because we are not 
addressing any root cause. Human error is more a symptom than a cause.
The aim of this chapter is to focus on the human side of quality and 
manufacturing errors. The way we look at the human side of these problems 
has evolved during the past few decades. Industrial psychologists and 
human reliability professionals took command during the investigation of 
catastrophic accidents (Chernobyl, Challenger, and aviation accidents), and 
the old conceptions changed. Now, we see human errors as the symptoms of 
deeper causes. In other words, human errors are consequences, not causes.
Most of the time, even though accidents are classified as mechanical 
or some other kind of failure, the roots go back to a human who made 
an error. For this discussion, human error excludes deliberate actions with 
harmful intent; these are considered sabotage. In the medical products 
regulated environment, the combination of human error and retraining 
is still indicated in the root cause and corrective action sections of many 
investigation reports. 
Human errors are not a uniform collection of unwanted acts. Lack of 
attention plays a significant role in all categories of human error. Slips, 
lapses, and mistakes are all more common when situational factors (fatigue, 
workload, multitasking, and boredom) divert our attention. In the regulated 
industries, these factors should be negligible; you should not be relying on 
memory for procedures and instructions. Batch records and device history 
records exist for that exact purpose. You must read the instructions, execute 
the task, and then document the action performed. 	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  169
U.S. FDA and foreign regulators require the consideration of human 
factors during the development of medical devices. In the landmark 1996 
guidance Do It By Design—An Introduction to Human Factors in Medical 
Devices, FDA established design requirements to avoid user errors. More 
recently, the Agency introduced those concepts of human reliability to drug 
and biotechnology manufacturers.
Some statistics related to human error are:
• Ninety-nine percent of accidental losses (except for natural 
disasters) begin with a human error.
• The root causes of the vast majority of accidents are management 
system weaknesses.
• Eight percent of men are color-blind, while only one in 200 women 
have the condition.
• Eighty percent of medical product recalls due to incorrect 
expiration date or incorrect lot/batch number are caused by a 
transposition of digits.
• One and a half million Americans are injured every year by drug 
errors in hospitals, nursing homes, and doctor’s offices (patients’ 
own medication mix-ups are not included). 
• On average, every hospitalized patient is subject to (at least) one 
medication error per day.
• Seventeen hours of work without a break is the same as being 
legally drunk.
• The worst time period for human errors is 2 a.m. to 5 a.m.
• About 15 percent of human errors are due to acquired habits.
• Human error accounts for 90 percent of road accidents.
• The rate of error and mistakes for most procedure-based tasks is 
one per hundred.
• Average workers are interrupted every 11 minutes and then spend 
almost one-third of their day recovering from these distractions.
Human factors is the common term given to the widely recognized disci￾pline of addressing interactions in the work environment between people, 
the facility, and its management systems. Although individuals make errors 
and mistakes, it is usually because human factors issues were not properly 
addressed. In addition to being a key and critical aspect of process safety 
management, human factors are also the basis of sound process quality 170  Chapter Seven
management. Human factors play an important role in process perform￾ance by using scientific knowledge and principles from many disciplines 
to reduce the frequency of errors and accidents. However, the value and 
importance of human factors has not yet been comprehensively accepted 
throughout the regulated industry. Among the main human factors 
influencing error in the medical product manufacturing industry, one 
can include:
• Compliance and quality culture
• Workplace involvement—motivation and attention
• Adequate supervision and staffing
• Procedures and task design
• Training and performance
• Working from memory
• Multitasking
Once we all agree that eliminating all human error is impossible (to do that, 
we would first have to eliminate all humans), our efforts should address 
two areas:
1. Reducing the probability of human error from the onset and when 
an unavoidable error occurs
2. Implementing barriers to detect those human errors and/or to 
minimize their impact on the quality of our processes
Using the CAPA concepts, these mitigation efforts have two parts:
1. The preventive part must encompass important human factors 
such as better supervision, better procedures and working 
instructions, and more effective training efforts. Make your 
processes and your documents as error-proof as you can. Do not 
hesitate to overuse mistake-proofing features, also known by the 
Japanese term of poka-yoke.
2. For the reactive part, you must improve your investigations. Don’t 
accept human error as the root cause; dig into the human factors 
and think twice before using retraining as a corrective action.
To succeed at error control and reduction, you must consider the influence 
the following factors have on behavior and performance:
• Design of facilities and equipment	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  171
• Information content and format (procedures, work instructions, and 
job aids)
• Training
• Method of work—supervision and management controls (including 
adequate resources and clear roles and responsibilities)
• Process of communications
There are three areas in which you must concentrate our effort in order to 
effectively and dramatically reduce the impact of so-called human error on 
the bottom line in the regulated industries. To do the right thing the first 
time, you need:
a. Better, user-centered documents (working instructions, 
specifications, and procedures) with clear, complete, and 
comprehensive instructions
b. Better training to ensure that workers understand why they 
are doing what they are doing, why they must always follow 
instructions, and what happens when instructions are not followed
c. Better supervision to ensure that workers always follow 
procedures and working instructions while performing any 
function in a GMP-regulated environment
Steps in reducing human errors include:
• Addressing the conditions and reducing the stressors that increase 
the frequency of errors
• Designing facilities and equipment to prevent slips and 
lapses occurring or to increase the chance of detecting and 
correcting them 
• Driving out complexity and designing jobs to avoid the need 
for tasks that involve very complex decisions, diagnoses, or 
calculations, for example, by writing procedures for rare events 
requiring decisions and actions
• Ensuring proper supervision, particularly for inexperienced staff 
or for tasks where there is a need for independent checking
• Checking that job aids such as procedures and instructions are 
clear, concise, available, up-to-date, and accepted by users
• Considering the possibility of human error when undertaking 
risk assessments172  Chapter Seven
• Thinking about the different causes of human errors during incident 
investigations in order to introduce measures to reduce the risk of a 
repeat incident
• Monitoring to ensure that measures taken to reduce error are 
effective
• Enhancing process (barrier) controls and poka-yokes
• Removing latent failures
• Making people accountable for errors and mistakes within a 
positive and blame-free environment
• Understanding the hows and whys of human errors
To reduce violations, managers could:
• Take steps to increase the chances of violations being detected 
using routine monitoring, internal audits, and so on
• Make rules and procedures relevant and practical, and eliminate 
unnecessary rules or instruction
• Train by explaining the reasons behind certain rules or procedures 
and their relevance
• Provide more training and better control (for example supervisory 
presence) for abnormal and emergency situations to minimize 
exceptional violations
Everyone can make errors no matter how well trained and motivated they 
are. Sometimes people are “set up” by the system to fail. The challenge is 
to develop error-tolerant systems and to prevent errors from occurring.
Reducing human error involves far more than taking disciplinary 
action against an individual. There are a range of measures that provide 
more effective controls, including design of the job and equipment, proce￾dures, and training. Paying attention to individual attitudes and motiva￾tions, design features of the job, and the organization will help to reduce 
violations. And last but not least important, you must establish an order for 
error control from best, ideal options to least effective barriers:
• Error or mistake-proof: make the error impossible (computer form 
cannot be saved if some information is missing; microwave cannot 
operate if door is open; production tank will unlock and open only 
if scanned containers of ingredients match the system’s bill of 
material for the lot).	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  173
• Error prevention: signals and alarms (for example, the red underline 
of incorrect spelling in Microsoft Word).
• Minimize the impact of error (inspection and test, or double 
verification of the addition of components to a mixing tank).
Regulatory Actions: Recalls and 
Health Hazard Evaluation 
Recall activities are one of the clearest examples of the use of risk manage￾ment activities within our industry. A recall is a method of removing or 
correcting products that are in violation of laws administered by FDA. 
Recalls may be conducted on a firm’s own initiative, by FDA request, or by 
FDA order under statutory authority to protect the public health and well￾being from products that present a risk of injury or gross deception or are 
otherwise defective.
A recall is an alternative to an FDA-initiated court action for removing 
or correcting violative products that have been distributed. 21 CFR 7 sets 
forth specific recall procedures for FDA to follow in monitoring recalls and 
assessing the adequacy of a firm’s efforts in a recall. A request by FDA that 
a firm recall a product is reserved for urgent situations and is directed to 
the firm that has primary responsibility for the manufacture and marketing 
of the product that is to be recalled.
Recall does not include market withdrawal or a stock recovery. A 
market withdrawal is a firm’s removal or correction of a distributed product 
that involves a minor violation that would not be subject to legal action 
by FDA or that involves no violation, for example, normal stock rotation 
practices, routine equipment adjustments and repairs, and so on. Almost all 
recalls are conducted on a voluntary basis by the manufacturer.
Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE). An evaluation of the health hazard 
presented by a product being recalled or considered for recall is conducted 
by FDA, taking into account, but not necessarily limited to, the follow­￾ing factors:
• Whether any disease or injuries have already occurred from the use 
of the product.
• Whether any existing conditions could contribute to a clinical 
situation that could expose humans or animals to a health hazard. 
Any conclusion shall be supported as completely as possible by 
scientific documentation and/or statements that the conclusion 
is the opinion of the individual(s) making the health hazard 
determination.174  Chapter Seven
• Assessment of hazard to various segments of the population 
(children, surgical patients, pets, livestock, and so on) who are 
expected to be exposed to the product being considered, with 
particular attention paid to the hazard to those individuals who may 
be at greatest risk.
• Assessment of the degree of seriousness of the health hazard to 
which the populations at risk would be exposed.
• Assessment of the likelihood of occurrence of the hazard.
• Assessment of the consequences (immediate or long-range) of 
occurrence of the hazard.
Based on this determination, FDA will assign the recall a classification, 
that is, Class I, Class II, or Class III, to indicate the relative degree of health 
hazard of the product being recalled or considered for recall.
Classification. Recalls are classified into a numerical designation (I, II, 
or III) by FDA to indicate the relative degree of health hazard presented by 
the product being recalled, as described in Table 7.1.
Recall Strategy. The recalling company must develop a recall strategy 
that takes into account the following factors as they apply to the individual 
circumstances of the particular recall:
• Results of health hazard evaluation
• Ease in identifying the product
• Degree to which the product’s deficiency is obvious to the 
consumer or user 
Class III
A situation in which use
of, or exposure to, a 
violative product is not 
likely to cause adverse 
health consequences
Class II
A situation in which use of,
or exposure to, a violative
product may cause 
temporary or medically 
reversible adverse health
consequences or where 
the probability of serious 
adverse health conse￾quences is remote
Class I
A situation in which
there is a reasonable 
probability that the use
of, or exposure to, a 
violative product will 
cause serious adverse 
health consequences
or death
Table 7.1 FDA recall classification.	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  175
• Degree to which the product remains unused in the marketplace
• Continued availability of essential products
FDA will review the adequacy of a proposed recall strategy and recom￾mend changes as appropriate. A recalling firm should conduct the recall in 
accordance with an approved recall strategy but need not delay initiation of 
a recall pending review of its recall strategy. A recall strategy will address 
the following elements regarding the conduct of the recall:
1. Depth of recall. Depending on the product’s degree of hazard and 
extent of distribution, the recall strategy will specify the level in 
the distribution chain to which the recall is to extend, as follows: 
 – Consumer or user level, which may vary with product, including 
any intermediate wholesale or retail level 
 – Retail level, including any intermediate wholesale level 
 – Wholesale level
2. Public warning. The purpose of a public warning is to alert the 
public that a product being recalled presents a serious hazard to 
health. This is reserved for urgent situations where other means 
of preventing the use of the recalled product appear inadequate. 
FDA, in consultation with the recalling firm, will ordinarily issue 
such publicity. When the recalling firm decides to issue its own 
public warning, it is requested to submit to FDA its proposed 
public warning and plan for distribution of the warning for review 
and comment. The recall strategy will specify whether a public 
warning is needed and whether it will be issued as: 
 – A general public warning through the general news media, 
either national or local as appropriate 
 – A public warning through specialized news media, for example, 
professional or trade press, or to specific segments of the 
population such as physicians, hospitals, and so on
3. Effectiveness checks. The purpose of effectiveness checks is to 
verify that all consignees (at the recall depth specified by the 
strategy) have received notification about the recall and have taken 
appropriate action. Consignees may be contacted through personal 
visits, telephone calls, letters, or a combination thereof. A guide 
entitled Methods for Conducting Recall Effectiveness Checks 
that describes the use of these different methods is available 
from FDA. The recalling firm will ordinarily be responsible for 176  Chapter Seven
conducting effectiveness checks, but FDA will assist in this task 
where necessary and appropriate. The recall strategy will specify 
the method(s) to be used and the level of effectiveness checks that 
will be conducted, as follows: 
 – Level A. 100 percent of the total number of consignees to be 
contacted 
 – Level B. Some percentage of the total number of consignees 
to be contacted, which percentage is to be determined on a 
case-by-case basis, but is greater than 10 percent and less than 
100 percent of the total number of consignees 
 – Level C. 10 percent of the total number of consignees to be 
contacted 
 – Level D. Two percent of the total number of consignees to be 
contacted
 – Level E. No effectiveness checks
Firm-Initiated Recall. A firm may decide of its own volition and under 
any circumstances to remove or correct a distributed product. A firm 
that does so because it believes the product to be violative is requested to 
immediately notify the recall coordinator of the appropriate FDA district 
office. Such removal or correction will be considered a recall only if FDA 
regards the product as involving a violation that is subject to legal action, 
for example, seizure. In such cases, the firm will be asked to provide FDA 
the following information:
1. Identity of the product involved
2. Reason for the removal or correction and the date and 
circumstances under which the product deficiency or possible 
deficiency was discovered
3. Evaluation of the risk associated with the deficiency or possible 
deficiency
4. Total amount of such products produced and/or the time span of 
the production
5. Total amount of such products estimated to be in distribution 
channels
6. Distribution information, including the number of direct accounts 
and, where necessary, the identity of the direct accounts	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  177
7. A copy of the firm’s recall communication if any has been issued, 
or a proposed communication if none has been issued
8. Proposed strategy for conducting the recall
9. Name and telephone number of the firm official who should be 
contacted concerning the recall
FDA will review the information submitted, advise the firm of the assigned 
recall classification, recommend any appropriate changes in the firm’s 
strategy for the recall, and advise the firm that its recall will be placed in 
the weekly FDA Enforcement Report. Pending this review, the firm need 
not delay initiation of its product removal or correction.
A firm may decide to recall a product when informed by FDA that 
the Agency has determined that the product in question violates the law, 
but the Agency has not specifically requested a recall. A firm that initiates 
a removal or correction of its product that the firm believes is a market 
withdrawal should consult with the appropriate FDA district office if the 
reason for the removal or correction is not obvious or clearly understood 
but where it is apparent—for example, because of complaints or adverse 
reactions related to the product—that the product is deficient in some 
respect. In such cases, FDA will assist the firm in determining the exact 
nature of the problem.
Recall Letter. A recalling firm is responsible for promptly notifying each 
of its affected direct accounts about the recall. The format, content, and 
extent of a recall communication should be commensurate with the hazard 
of the product being recalled and the strategy developed for that recall. In 
general terms, the purpose of a recall communication is to convey:
• That the product in question is subject to a recall
• That further distribution or use of any remaining product should 
cease immediately
• Where appropriate, that the direct account should in turn notify its 
customers who received the product about the recall
• Instructions regarding what to do with the product
A recall communication can be accomplished by telegrams, mailgrams, 
or first-class letters conspicuously marked, preferably in bold red type, 
on the letter and the envelope “medical device recall [or correction].” 
The letter and the envelope should also be marked “urgent” for Class I 
and Class II recalls and, when appropriate, for Class III recalls. Telephone 
calls or other personal contacts should ordinarily be confirmed by one of 178  Chapter Seven
the aforementioned methods and/or documented in an appropriate manner. 
A recall communication should be written in accordance with the follow￾ing guidelines:
• Be brief and to the point
• Identify clearly the product, size, lot number(s), code(s), or serial 
number(s), and any other pertinent descriptive information to enable 
accurate and immediate identification of the product
• Explain concisely the reason for the recall and the hazard involved, 
if any
• Provide specific instructions on what should be done with respect 
to the recalled products
• Provide a ready means for the recipient to report to the recalling 
firm whether it has any of the products (for example, by sending a 
postage-paid, self-addressed postcard or by allowing the recipient to 
place a collect call to the recalling firm)
The recall communication should not contain irrelevant qualifications, 
promotional materials, or any other statement that might detract from 
the message. If necessary, follow-up communications should be sent to 
those who fail to respond to the initial recall communication. It is highly 
recommended that the recalling firm discuss the recall letter with the 
FDA district office recall coordinator prior to issuing the notification. 
Consignees who receive a recall communication should immediately carry 
out the instructions set forth by the recalling firm and, where necessary, 
extend the recall to its consignees in accordance with the instructions 
described previously.
Recall Status Reports. The recalling firm is requested to submit periodic 
recall status reports to the appropriate FDA district office so the agency 
may assess the progress of the recall. The frequency of such reports will 
be determined by the relative urgency of the recall and will be specified 
by FDA in each recall case; generally, the reporting interval will be 
between two and four weeks. Unless otherwise specified or inappropriate 
in a given recall case, the recall status report should contain the following 
information:
1. Number of consignees notified of the recall, and date and method 
of notification
2. Number of consignees responding to the recall communication, 
and quantity of products on hand at the time it was received	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  179
3. Number of consignees who did not respond (if needed, the identity 
of nonresponding consignees may be requested by FDA)
4. Number of products returned or corrected by each consignee 
contacted, and the quantity of products accounted for
5. Number and results of effectiveness checks that were made
6. Estimated time frames for completion of the recall
Recall status reports are to be discontinued when the recall is terminated 
by FDA.
Termination of a Recall. A recall will be terminated when FDA deter￾mines that all reasonable efforts have been made to remove or correct the 
product in accordance with the recall strategy and when it is reasonable to 
assume that the product subject to the recall has been removed and proper 
disposition or correction has been made commensurate with the degree of 
hazard of the recalled product. Written notification that a recall has been 
terminated will be issued by the appropriate FDA district office to the 
recalling firm. A recalling firm may request termination of its recall by 
submitting a written request to the appropriate FDA district office stating 
that the recall is effective in accordance with the criteria set forth and by 
accompanying the request with the most current recall status report and a 
description of the disposition of the recalled product.
Public Notification of Recall. FDA publishes a weekly FDA Enforcement 
Report (Food and Drug Administration 2023b) that contains all enforce￾ment actions, including recalls, field corrections, seizures, and injunctions.
Benefit-Risk Determination
FDA has been working extensively for several years to develop what the 
agency calls “benefit–risk assessment frameworks” covering medical 
products. Following is a brief discussion of the current state of these initia￾tives for drugs and biological products and for medical devices.
Drugs and biological products. The U.S. FDA Safety and Innovation 
Act of 2012 (FDASIA) requires FDA to implement a structured benefit–
risk framework in the new drug approval process. By establishing a 
structured framework for visualizing the comparative benefits and risks 
and incorporating it into FDA’s review templates, FDA and sponsors can 
understand and communicate more effectively the judgments that went into 
an FDA product approval decision. 180  Chapter Seven
FDA is currently implementing a structured benefit–risk assessment 
framework to organize its review of a product’s benefit and risk, and 
communicate benefit–risk assessment decisions at the point of approval 
or post-market regulatory decision. A key element of the 2012 passage of 
FDASIA was the requirement for FDA to establish a structured benefit–
risk framework to improve the transparency and clarity of FDA’s benefit–
risk decisions and to communicate more effectively the subjective value 
judgments underlying benefit–risk determinations. FDASIA directs FDA 
to “implement a structured risk–benefit assessment framework in the new 
drug approval process to facilitate the balanced consideration of benefits 
and risks, a consistent and systematic approach to the discussion and regu￾latory decision-making, and the communication of the benefits and risks of 
new drugs.” 
In February 2013, FDA released a draft five-year plan, PDUFA V 
Implementation Plan: Structured Approach to Benefit–Risk Assessment 
in Drug Regulatory Decision-Making, which explains that fundamental 
to FDA’s review of new products are a set of clinical judgments and facts 
regarding the balance of benefits, risks, unmet medical need, social and 
behavioral science, and scientific uncertainty: 
A framework for benefit–risk decision-making that summarizes 
the relevant facts, uncertainties, and key areas of judgment, and 
clearly explains how these factors influence a regulatory decision, 
can greatly inform and clarify the regulatory discussion. Such 
a framework can provide transparency regarding the basis of 
conflicting recommendations made by different parties using 
the same information. When the final decision is made, a single 
framework provides a standardized, predictable, and accessible 
form that communicates the basis for FDA’s regulatory decision 
to the public, while also documenting the decision for reference 
as FDA considers similar benefit–risk assessments in the future.
The framework is characterized as a 5 × 3 grid that reviewers will fill in 
with a lay-friendly description of key benefit–risk determinations, including 
an analysis of the condition, available treatment options, clinical benefits, 
risks, and potential approaches to minimize risk (see Figure 7.1). The first 
two domains of the framework, “Analysis of the Condition” and “Current 
Treatment Options,” are informed by incorporating patient views of their 
own condition and care. Feedback received during FDA’s Patient Focused 
Drug Development meetings is being used to help fill in these domains 
and is included in the “Voice of the Patient” reports that capture the meet­￾ing proceedings. 	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  181

Medical Devices. Two major guidances were published by U.S. FDA 
during 2016 regarding benefit–risk determination for medical devices, 
detailing its approach to considering the benefits and risks for compliance 
and enforcement actions that could impact medical device availability:
• Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff—
Factors to Consider When Making Benefit–Risk Determinations in 
Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications, 
issued August 24, 2016. (Food and Drug Administration 2016c)
– The concepts discussed in this guidance are applicable to the 
medical device development process from design to market. As 
such, the benefit–risk factors set out herein should be considered 
during the design, nonclinical testing, pre–Investigational Device 
Exemption (IDE), and IDE phases, as well as in assembling and 
assessing PMA applications or de novo requests.
• Draft Guidance for Industry—Factors to Consider Regarding 
Benefit–Risk in Medical Device Product Availability, Compliance, 
and Enforcement Decisions, issued June 16, 2016.
– This draft guidance is intended to harmonize FDA’s approach 
to weighing benefits and risks for medical device product 
availability, compliance, and enforcement decisions with FDA’s 
benefit–risk framework for assessing medical device marketing 
and investigational device exemption (IDE) applications. 
The benefit–risk factors in this draft guidance also support 
assessment of medical devices with real world evidence. While 
the benefit–risk factors in this draft guidance are not identical 
to the other frameworks, this draft guidance builds upon FDA’s 182  Chapter Seven
premarket review benefit–risk policy in an effort to improve 
consistency in our patient-centered approach and decision 
making across the total product life cycle.
This draft guidance also mentions that ISO 14971 is an FDA-recognized 
standard, and assuring conformity with this standard may help device 
manufacturers meet the requirements specified in the design controls 
section (21 CFR 820.30) and other sections of 21 CFR Part 820. Both ISO 
14971 and 21 CFR Part 820 take a total life-cycle approach to management 
of risks associated with medical devices, and expect that manufacturers 
will incorporate post-market data into their device risk management 
process, including new risks and changes to existing risks identified after a 
device is on the market. 
This draft guidance document provides a benefit–risk framework for 
FDA and stakeholders regarding use of benefit–risk information in medical 
device product availability, compliance, and enforcement decisions. Good 
documentation of risk management decisions by manufacturers may help 
to streamline these decisions for both FDA and manufacturers, produce 
outcomes for patients that deliver the most benefit for the least amount of 
risk, and provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
In the August 24, 2016 guidance, FDA establishes that although a great 
deal of emphasis is placed on the importance of clinical data in demon￾strating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, nonclinical data 
also can be critical to understanding a device’s safety and effectiveness. 
Medical devices often have attributes that cannot be tested using clinical 
methods alone and that play a major role in the safety or effectiveness of 
the device. 
Both clinical and nonclinical data can play a role in FDA’s benefit–
risk determinations, and the factors discussed in this guidance are 
informed by both types of data. FDA relies on valid scientific evidence 
in making risk and benefit determinations, including the critical issue of 
identifying “probable risks” and “probable benefits” in the first place. In 
general, probable risks and probable benefits do not include theoretical 
risks and benefits, but instead ones whose existence and characteristics 
are supported by valid scientific evidence. Generally, isolated case reports, 
random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific 
evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific 
evidence to show safety or effectiveness. However, such information may 
be considered in identifying a device that has questionable safety and 
effectiveness, as required in 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2).
In this guidance, FDA details factors considered as part of the 
benefit–risk determination and also give examples of how the factors 	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  183
interrelate and how they may affect FDA’s decisions. Among those factors, 
the guidance mentions:
1. Assessment of the benefits of devices
a. Extent of the probable benefit(s)
 i. The type of benefit(s)
 ii. The magnitude of the benefit(s)
 iii. The probability of the patient experiencing one or more 
benefit(s)
 iv. The duration of effect(s)
2. Assessment of the risks of devices
a. Extent of the probable risk(s)/harm(s)
 i. Severity, types, number, and rates of harmful events 
associated with the use of the device
 1. Device-related serious adverse events
 2. Device-related nonserious events
 3. Procedure-related complications
 ii. Probability of a harmful event
 iii. Duration of harmful events
 iv. Risk from false positive or false negative for diagnostics
3. Additional factors in the assessment of the probable benefits and 
risk of devices
a. Uncertainty
b. Patient-centric assessments and patient-reported outcomes
c. Characterization of the disease
d. Patient perspectives
 i. Severity of disease or condition
 ii. Disease chronicity
 iii. Availability of alternative treatment/diagnostics option
e. Availability of alternative treatment or diagnostics
f. Risk mitigation
g. Post-market data
h. Novel technology addressing unmet medical need184  Chapter Seven
CAPA System
Application of risk management techniques to the CAPA process was 
discussed in Chapter 5. Risk must be used to decide the depth and magni￾tude of the nonconformities and deviation investigations, and such prioriti￾zation needs to be based on the risk and the criticality (magnitude) of the 
issue. Risk management tools can also provide the basis for identifying, 
evaluating, and communicating the potential quality impact of a suspected 
quality defect, complaint, trend, deviation, out-of-specification result, and 
so on, and to facilitate risk communications and determine appropriate 
action to address significant product defects in conjunction with regulatory 
authorities, for example, recall activities.
Following are a few critical points you must remember:
• Always link your investigation and CAPA processes to the risk 
(importance and magnitude) of the event.
• Provide enough resources to investigate, review, and manage your 
CAPA system.
• Provide enough time to perform investigation and CAPA activities.
• Professionalize your investigation and CAPA functions (use full￾time investigators.
• Establish multifunctional boards for investigation report evaluation 
and for CAPA plan activities.
• Always consider your investigation and CAPA functions among 
your most critical processes.
The results of CAPA reviews should reveal any previously unrecognized 
risks and the effectiveness of risk control measures. This information 
should also be utilized to determine the effectiveness of the risk manage￾ment activities and determine required actions to be taken to correct the 
identified issues and prevent recurrence. For example, a service report 
indicating a safety-related issue with a medical device is reported to a 
manufacturer and is determined to be a complaint. The complaint is 
reviewed and an investigation is initiated. During the investigation, it is 
determined that a manufacturing process change had occurred. Among the 
potential causes:
• Inadequate assessment of the process change
• Inadequate (or lack of) revalidation
• Inadequate risk control measures
• Risk control measures not evaluated with the change	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  185
For any combination of these, it is expected that the risk management 
system will use this post-market information to initiate another design risk 
assessment. The extent of the revised risk assessment will depend on the 
complaint investigation results. The results of any revised risk assessment 
should be documented. Any new or revised risk control measures will be 
part of the overall CAPA activities.
During the investigation of any nonconformity or deviation, a 
preliminary evaluation of the impact of the event based on the initial data 
and evidence available is one of the first actions to be performed once a 
problem is detected. The outcome of that initial impact assessment is a 
determination of the level of risk. This determination will help us guide the 
efforts of our investigation process. 
At this point, most people lose sight of a tool that has been out there 
for many decades to help us analyze risk and determine the actions needed 
to address the risk. That tool is known as failure mode and effects analysis 
(FMEA). It is a systematic method to identify and prevent product and 
process problems before they occur. Used proactively, FMEA is an excellent 
tool of true preventive actions: those actions that can be implemented prior 
to the first occurrence of the failure.
Most companies do not see the direct link between FMEA and the 
CAPA system. The main reason for this seems to be the fact that most 
FMEAs are developed by technical groups, process engineers, and so on. 
Meanwhile, the CAPA system is mostly led by the quality group. If these 
teams work as silos, they will never interact in the way they are supposed 
to interact. A proactive FMEA can feed the CAPA system with true 
preventive actions, that is, actions that can be implemented prior to the first 
occurrence of the failure. On the other hand, the CAPA system provides 
corrective and preventive actions. As can be noticed, both systems provide 
for a closed-loop process. In many regulated companies, the loop is not 
closed. For example, in many cases the only interaction between FMEA 
and CAPA starts with a nonconformance. At that moment, the typical 
question is “Was that failure mode included in the FMEA?” Unfortunately, 
the most common answer to this question is “No.” The typical action is 
to revise the FMEA to include that failure mode. However, such action is 
reactive rather than proactive. 
In an effective CAPA system, the answer to the question “Was this 
failure mode included in the FMEA?” must be “Yes.” Then, the next 
question should be “Based on the FMEA, which kind of risk level does that 
failure mode represent: low, medium, or high?” This could be used as the 
basis for the risk prioritization of investigations.186  Chapter Seven
Supplier Selection and Control
Risk management activities should identify hazards and evaluate risks, 
including those potentially introduced by suppliers early in the product 
realization process. Risk management roles and responsibilities of the 
manufacturer and supplier should be defined as part of the purchasing 
requirements. In addition, prescribed risk control measures derived from 
the risk management process during product realization should be included 
in the purchasing requirements as part of the purchasing information.
Established criteria for selection, evaluation, and reevaluation of 
suppliers of purchased products and services should also be based on the 
risk associated with identified hazards related to the purchased products 
and services as determined during the risk management process.
Increasing industry accountability to prevent harm to consumers is 
critical to an effective medical product safety system. The cornerstone of 
a prevention-focused approach in the sourcing of ingredients or compo￾nents and the manufacturing and distribution of medical products is the 
implementation of a QMS approach addressing the safety, quality, and 
security responsibilities of all persons who manufacture products, includ￾ing starting materials, for sale to U.S. consumers. A QMS builds on cGMP 
requirements, recognizing that supply chain integrity and product safety 
and quality must be every manufacturer’s responsibility.
To reduce risks, manufacturers should build quality into the manufac￾turing of their products and implement effective preventive measures at 
their facility, as well as ensure the implementation of such measures at their 
suppliers’ facilities. Manufacturers should be accountable for assessing the 
hazards introduced by their operations and those of their suppliers and 
consignees, implementing the QMS, monitoring for problems before they 
result in harm to consumers, taking swift corrective actions to prevent 
recurrence of any hazards that are not effectively managed, and assuring 
that medical products that leave their facilities are safe and effective.
Supplier initial selection and monitoring should take into account 
factors such as:
• Existing legal requirements
• Overall compliance status and history of the company or facility
• Robustness of a company’s quality risk management activities
• Complexity of the site and complexity of the manufacturing process
• Complexity of the product and its therapeutic significance
• Number and significance of quality defects and product recalls	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  187
• Results of previous audits/inspections
• Major changes in buildings, equipment, processes, key personnel
• Experience with manufacturing of a product (for example, 
frequency, volume, and so on)
Importers are uniquely positioned in the supply chain to make sure foreign￾made products, ingredients, and components are safe because they are 
responsible for bringing those items into the United States. In January 
2009, FDA and other federal agencies issued a draft guidance for industry 
on good importer practices (GIPs) to encourage importers to take proactive 
steps to prevent harm to consumers from the products they import. The 
guidance sets out recommendations to importers of products, including 
FDA-regulated products, on practices and procedures to follow to increase 
the likelihood that the products they import are in compliance with 
applicable U.S. safety and security requirements. The GIPs are broadly 
organized under four guiding principles: 
1. Establishing a product safety management program
2. Knowing the product and applicable U.S. requirements 
3. Verifying product and firm compliance with U.S. requirements 
throughout the supply chain and product life cycle 
4. Taking corrective and preventive action when the imported 
product or firm is not compliant with U.S. requirements
The goal of GIPs is to encourage importers to institute practices to identify 
and minimize risks associated with imported products. The draft guidance 
generally recommends that importers should know the producer of the 
foreign products they purchase and any other manufacturers with which 
they do business, that they understand the products they import and the 
vulnerabilities associated with these products, that they understand the 
hazards that may arise during the product life cycle, including all stages 
of production, and that they ensure proper control and monitoring of 
these hazards.
Outsourcing
Outsourcing activities is a common situation nowadays within the medical 
product manufacturing industries. ICH Q10 states that: 
A pharmaceutical company can outsource activities at all stages 
of the product lifecycle. The pharmaceutical quality system, 
including the management responsibilities described in this 188  Chapter Seven
section, extends to the oversight and review of outsourced activi￾ties. Normally under a contract, the contract giver should be 
responsible for assessing the suitability and competence of the 
contract acceptor to carry out the work required. Responsibilities 
for quality-related activities of the contract giver and contract 
acceptor should be specified in a written agreement.
A manufacturer may outsource processes (for example, sterilization, valida￾tion, manufacturing or packaging processes, testing, design, and so on) but 
must maintain control over these outsourced processes and products. The 
manufacturer is responsible for incorporating appropriate risk management 
activities for these processes and products through planning and by 
ensuring that risk control measures are appropriately applied. Before the 
approval and implementation of a change to any outsourced process or 
product, the manufacturer should:
• Review the change
• Assess whether new risks have been discovered
• Determine whether current and/or new individual residual risks 
and/or the overall risk is acceptable according to the predetermined 
existing acceptability criteria
If there are any risk control measures applied to outsourced processes 
or products, the risk control measures and their importance should 
be documented within the purchasing data or information and clearly 
communicated to the supplier.
As stated in numerous laws, regulations, and guidances, the primary 
manufacturer is responsible:
• 21 CFR 200.10(b) “FDA . . . regards extramural facilities as an 
extension of the manufacturer’s own facility.”
• 21 CFR 211.22(a) “Quality Control Unit (QCU) is ultimately 
responsible for approving or rejecting drug products 
manufactured, processed, packed, or held under contract by 
another company.”
• 21 USC 351(a)(2)(B) states that “a drug is considered to be 
adulterated if the drug is not manufactured in conformance 
with CGMP.”
– This applies to finished drug products, drug components, and 
all sites under contract to manufacture or supply drugs and drug 
components.
– The manufacturer and private label distributor can both be 
held liable.	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  189
• 21 USC 301 states that “introducing or causing the introduction of 
adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited.”
• ICH Q9(R1) says regarding outsourcing, “Members of the supply 
chain are partners.”
• ICH Q10 says regarding outsourcing: 
– Control and review of all outsourcing activities is an element of a 
manufacturer’s pharmaceutical quality system.
– The manufacturer is ultimately responsible to ensure that 
processes are in place to assure the control of outsourced 
activities and quality of purchased materials.
– A manufacturer should have adequate procedures for auditing 
and qualifying facilities prior to outsourcing and throughout the 
process, and for contract management and supervision. 
The analysis of recent tragedies involving contaminated medical and food 
products reveals what went wrong: 
• There was a complete lack of traceability for components.
• Manufacturer could not identify the root cause.
• Manufacturer could not determine where problems started.
• Manufacturer could not fix problem and assure it wouldn’t 
happen again.
• Acceptance of product was based largely on a piece of paper 
purporting quality (certificate of analysis).
• Little or no testing was performed at receiving sites.
• Test methods that were or would have been performed were unable 
to detect or signal adulteration.
This author recently worked on one case where a major pharmaceutical 
company outsourced most cleaning and maintenance activities for buildings 
and equipment at a manufacturing site. The external company brought in 
a platoon of workers without any previous experience in FDA-regulated 
industry and without cGMP training. Problems with documentation, 
including data integrity issues, were the immediate, and logical, outcome 
of this situation. These dangerous compliance issues can jeopardize the 
site compliance records with FDA and other foreign regulators. Both 
companies are now putting huge efforts (and money) into controlling the 
risk in the form of numerous corrective and remedial actions.190  Chapter Seven
DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS/
CHANGE MANAGEMENT
Risk management techniques can be very useful during the control and 
management of changes to documents and records. Change control requires 
three elements:
a. The description of the proposed change
b. Why the change is needed
c. Why the change is acceptable
Risk situations associated with this element range from inadequate just￾ification of the proposed changes (including lack of supporting studies, 
validations, and so on) to the use of either unapproved or obsolete docu￾ments. It is strongly recommended to establish some kind of criticality 
matrix to evaluate the impact on product quality of changes to facilities, 
equipment, materials, manufacturing processes, testing methods, and 
so on. Based on the result of this risk assessment, additional controls 
(top management approval as an example) can be added to the change 
approval process.
Risk management techniques must also be used to determine appro￾priate actions preceding the implementation of a change, for example, 
additional testing, (re)qualification, (re)validation, or communication with 
regulators (preapproval notification, and so on). Finally, risk management 
techniques can be used to identify high-risk equipment and facilities 
that need to be maintained under strict change control, as well as other 
equipment and facilities that can be placed under a simpler change manage￾ment program.
DATA INTEGRITY
Developing a medical product and bringing it to market involves different 
actors and activities. A fundamental step is linked to the robustness and 
accuracy of the data submitted by manufacturers to regulatory authorities. 
These data must be comprehensive, complete, accurate, and true to assure 
the quality of studies supporting applications for medicines and medical 
devices to be put on the market. They also must comply with good 
manufacturing practices (GMPs), good clinical practice (GCP), and good 
laboratory practices (GLPs).
Recently, there has been a high level of focus on the increasing 
number of U.S. FDA Warning Letters, WHO Notices of Concern, and EU 	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  191
Statements of Non-compliance where false or misleading information has 
been identified during inspections. Failures in data integrity management 
can arise either from poor systemic control of data management systems 
due to a lack of knowledge and human error, or from intentionally hidden, 
falsified, or misleading data. 
Between 2015 and 2016, major regulatory bodies such as the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA), the U.S. FDA, the World Health Organization 
(WHO), and the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) 
published guidances on the topic of data integrity and data management. 
Data integrity enables good decision-making by manufacturers and 
regulatory authorities. It is a fundamental requirement of the medical 
products quality system, applying equally to manual (paper) and electronic 
systems. Promotion of a quality culture, together with implementation of 
organizational and technical measures that ensure data integrity, is the 
responsibility of senior management. It requires participation and commit￾ment by staff at all levels within the company, by the company’s suppliers, 
and by its distributors.
Senior management should ensure that data integrity risk is assessed, 
mitigated, and communicated in accordance with the principles of quality 
risk management. The effort and resources assigned to data integrity 
measures should be commensurate with the risk to product quality and 
balanced with other quality assurance resource demands. Where long￾term measures are identified to achieve the desired state of control, interim 
measures should be implemented to mitigate risk and should be monitored 
for effectiveness.
On August 11, 2016, the EMA announced the publication of a new 
GMP data integrity guidance. Data from testing, manufacturing, packag￾ing, distribution, and monitoring of drugs are used by regulators to review 
the quality, safety, and efficacy of drugs; therefore, ensuring the integrity 
and completeness of such data is important. The EMA guidance includes 
a set of questions and answers developed by the agency’s GMP/Good 
Distribution Practice Inspectors Working Group. 
The document addresses the assessment of risk to data integrity, 
risk management strategies, design and control of electronic and paper￾based documentation systems, and ensuring data integrity of outside 
contractors. EMA stated in a press release that the new guidance is aligned 
with other guidance issued by regulatory authorities participating in the 
PIC/S. It appears that regulators are taking a closer look at data integrity 
industrywide. 
FDA released its own data integrity draft guidance in April 2016 
(further revised in December 2018), and a string of FDA-issued Warning 192  Chapter Seven
Letters for data integrity violations have recently been published on the 
agency’s website. Specifically, from January 2015 to May 15, 2016, 21 
out of 28 warning letters given to drug manufacturers have involved data 
integrity issues (Food and Drug Administration 2016a).
The draft guidance, which relies on numerous prior guidances, 
contains the following recommendations:
• For recording data, manufacturing, or testing steps, numbered, 
controlled forms to be issued and reconciled by quality assurance.
• Disclosure to FDA of findings of data integrity violations, and 
“removing at all levels individuals responsible for (data integrity) 
problems from cGMP positions.”
• Both audit trail review and review of electronic testing by quality 
assurance prior to batch release.
• Control strategies must ensure that all original laboratory records 
(papers and electronic records) are reviewed by a person to make 
certain all test results are appropriately reported.
• Immediate, irreversible recording of electronic testing data 
(including upon completion of each HPLC testing sequence) as 
opposed to recording only at the end of the day.
The 21 CFR Part 211 regulations that FDA emphasizes in the draft guid￾ance as forming an integral part of the data integrity requirements include:
• § 211.68 (requiring that “backup data are exact and complete,” and 
“secure from alteration, inadvertent erasures, or loss”)
• § 212.110(b) (requiring that data be “stored to prevent deterioration 
or loss”)
• §§ 211.100 and 211.160 (requiring that certain activities be 
“documented at the time of performance” and that laboratory 
controls be “scientifically sound”)
• § 211.180 (requiring that records be retained as “original records,” 
“true copies,” or other “accurate reproductions of the original 
records”)
• §§ 211.188, 211.194, and 212.60(g) (requiring “complete 
information,” “complete data derived from all tests,” “complete 
record of all data,” and “complete records of all tests performed”)	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  193
FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT
Machines and buildings are two essential elements of any medical product 
manufacturing site along with the people handling the equipment. Life 
cycles of facilities and equipment are similar, from initial installation to 
final decommissioning, and risk management techniques are an integral 
part of those activities. During the design of facilities and equipment, 
these techniques help to determine appropriate zones in such areas as, 
for example:
• Flow of material and personnel
• Minimizing contamination, especially cross-contamination
• Pest control measures
• Prevention of mix-ups
• Open versus closed equipment
• Clean rooms versus isolator technologies for aseptic/sterile products
• Dedicated or segregated facilities/equipment
They can also be used to determine appropriate product contact materials 
for equipment and containers (for example, selection of stainless-steel 
grade, gaskets, and lubricants), determine appropriate utilities (for example, 
steam, gases, power source, compressed air, heating, ventilation, air 
conditioning, water, and so on), and to determine appropriate preventive 
maintenance for associated equipment (for example, inventory of necessary 
spare parts). Table 7.2 describes utilization of risk management for control 
of facilities and equipment.
Over the past several years, the condition of aging manufacturing 
facilities has become an area of concern both for medical product manu￾facturers and regulators worldwide. In the case of the United States, 
inspectional observations against 21 CFR 211 Subpart C “Buildings and 
Facilities” are becoming more frequent year after year. Citations of “poor 
maintenance,” very often linked to aging facilities, are included in many 
inspectional reports and Warning Letters. 194  Chapter Seven

Table 7.2 Utilization of risk management in facilities and equipment.
DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
Preproduction activities such as design and development of new medical 
products are a perfect fit for the use of risk management techniques. Two 
fundamental references that go deep inside design and development risk are 
ICH Q8(R2) Guidance for Industry: Q8(R2) Pharmaceutical Development 
(International Conference on Harmonization 2010) and GHTF/SG3/N15R8 
Implementation of Risk Management Principles and Activities within a 
Quality Management System (Global Harmonization Task Force 2005). 
Design and development of a medical product is an evolutionary process, 
embracing many different elements. Integral to activities associated with 
this process are the identification and control of risks. Risk controls can 
be influenced by regulatory, technical, and business considerations, as 
well as considerations of product safety and functionality, with the goal 
to reduce risk to an acceptable level while maintaining product feasibility 
and functionality.
Risk management activities should begin as early as possible in the 
design and development phase, when it is easier to prevent problems 
rather than correct them later. For each identified hazard, the risk must 
be estimated. In risk evaluation, the manufacturer decides whether risk 	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  195
reduction is needed. The results from this risk evaluation, such as the need 
for risk control measures, then become part of the design input. Risk control 
measures are part of the design output and are evaluated during design 
verification. This design input/output/verification cycle will iterate and 
continue throughout the overall design control process until the residual 
risks have been reduced to an acceptable level and can be maintained at 
an acceptable level. The overall effectiveness of risk control measures is 
confirmed during design validation.
However, relying exclusively on design and development processes 
to control risk is not sufficient. Even the best design and development 
processes cannot avoid design output error. Once the product is on the 
market, risk management activities must be linked to quality management 
processes, for example, production and process controls, CAPA activities, 
servicing (in the case of medical devices), and customer feedback. Follow￾ing are some uses of risk management techniques during the design and 
development stage:
• To assess the critical attributes of raw materials, solvents, active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and starting materials, 
components and subassemblies for medical devices, excipients, 
or packaging materials, including criteria for purchasing selection 
and control
• To establish appropriate specifications, identify critical process 
parameters, and establish manufacturing controls (for example, 
using information from development studies regarding the clinical 
significance of quality attributes and the ability to control them 
during processing)
• To decrease variability of critical quality attributes of 
medical products
• To assess the need for additional studies (for example, 
bioequivalence, stability)
PRODUCTION AND
PROCESS CONTROL
Risk management techniques can be used in production areas to:
• Evaluate the frequency and extent of control testing (incoming, 
in-process, and finished product). Such analysis can be used, 
for example, to justify reduced testing under conditions of 
proven control.196  Chapter Seven
• Evaluate and justify the use of PAT in conjunction with parametric 
and real-time release.
• Establish the suitability of equipment and the frequency of cleaning, 
maintenance, and calibration, which should be considered with 
reference to the risks associated with the process.
• Review and update procedures and work instructions to reflect any 
appropriate risk control measures.
• Determine appropriate production planning (for example, dedicated, 
campaign, or concurrent production process sequences).
In the case of medical devices, risk management activities should be used 
in conjunction with regulatory requirements to establish criteria for trace￾ability and define which devices, components, materials, and work environ￾ment conditions require traceability. Points to be considered include:
• Origin of components and materials
• Distribution and location of the device after delivery (to the first 
consignee)
• Intended use of the device (for example, life sustaining, life 
supporting, or implantable)
• Probability of failure
• Consequences of failure for patients, users, or other persons
Risk assessment of manufacturing processes, using tools such as FMEA, 
FTA, HACCP, or HAZOP, can help establish or improve process controls 
by identifying:
• What can go wrong at each step of the manufacturing process
• The impact of a failure mode on the product
• The likelihood of failures
• Controls to detect and prevent a failure or causes
CAPA system information about production—such as the rate of noncon￾formities, the rate of rework, scrap, and yield—and other sources of quality 
data should be evaluated and/or compared against the current risk manage￾ment output to confirm adequacy and completeness of risk controls.	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  197
Trend Analysis and Statistical Process Control
Manufacturers need to continually monitor and analyze data to detect any 
developing trend. Risk management techniques will help during:
• Selection, evaluation, and interpretation of trend results of data 
within the product quality review
• Interpretation of monitoring data (for example, to support an 
assessment of the appropriateness of revalidation or changes in 
sampling methods)
• The continual improvement process throughout the product 
life cycle
The analysis of data should demonstrate that the decisions and risk control 
measures determined within the risk management process are appropriate.
Aseptic Process in the Pharmaceutical Industry
Aseptic processes are probably among the most difficult and demanding of 
medical product manufacturing processes. Because of the nature of aseptic 
processes, sterile products produced aseptically present a significantly 
higher risk to the patient than terminally sterilized (for example, autoclaved 
or irradiated) products. Because of the high level of risk, an effective 
quality risk management program is necessary to protect the patient. 
Operator training and behavior, process validation, plant and equipment 
maintenance and change control management, and manufacturing process 
documentation are all critical success factors in the aseptic production 
arena (Parenteral Drug Association 2008; White 2009).
An effective risk management program aids in the careful control of 
the process, reducing the risk of contamination as well as wasted effort in 
controlling insignificant risks. While aseptic processing usually involves 
filling of final drug product, there are other types of aseptic processes, 
including aseptic assembly of devices or combination products, aseptic 
crystallization or aseptic precipitation of drug product to produce a sterile 
bulk-drug substance, and aseptic formulation of final drug product.
Aseptic processes have in common a high level of risk. A contamination 
event of a sterile product has an enormous regulatory impact and also will 
impact the reputation of the manufacturer and its financial viability. cGMP 
regulations for aseptic manufacture of human and veterinary products 
mandate that an incident involving product sterility failure or media fill 
contamination is fully investigated, and also that the manufacturer establish 198  Chapter Seven
an environmental monitoring program that is properly validated to ensure 
environmental contaminates are detected.
Aseptic processing requires careful control of the aseptic environment, 
control of personnel practices and procedures, sterilization of equipment 
and components, extensive environmental monitoring, and many other 
controls. The number of controls required and the severe consequences 
of control failure make aseptic processing one of the highest-risk 
pharmaceutical processes. Quality risk management is an essential tool in 
ensuring product quality. 
Validations and Revalidations
Effective process validation contributes significantly to assuring medical 
product quality. The basic principle of quality assurance is that a 
product should be produced that is fit for its intended use. This principle 
incorporates the understanding that the following conditions exist: 
• Quality, safety, and efficacy are designed or built into the product.
• Quality cannot be adequately assured merely by in-process and 
finished product inspection or testing.
Each step of a manufacturing process is controlled to assure that the 
finished product meets all quality attributes, including specifications. 
Risk management techniques such as FTA, FMEA, HAZOP, and HACCP 
can be used to identify the scope and extent of verification, qualification, 
and validation activities (for example, analytical methods, processes, 
sampling, monitoring, equipment, and cleaning methods). It also can help 
to distinguish between critical and noncritical process steps to facilitate the 
design of a validation study. 
Process validation and the determination of the need for revalidation 
may be influenced by the results of risk management activities. Results 
of process validation or revalidation may identify the need for additional 
risk control measures, for example, confirming or refining specific process 
parameters and controls when the source of an identified hazard is process 
variability. When process changes are undertaken, current risk control 
measures should be reviewed for suitability. This review should also ensure 
that no new hazards were introduced. When a high-risk process is under 
validation, there should be proportionately increased sampling, testing, or 
more-rigorous acceptance criteria to provide greater assurance of process 
acceptability. 	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  199
The 2011 FDA process validation guidance (Food and Drug Adminis￾tration 2011a) specifically incorporates the following risk management 
principles: 
A successful validation program depends upon information and 
knowledge from product and process development. This knowl￾edge and understanding is the basis for establishing an approach 
to control of the manufacturing process that result in products 
with the desired quality attributes. Manufacturers should: 
• Understand the sources of variation
• Detect the presence and degree of variation 
• Understand the impact of variation on the process and ultimately 
on product attributes 
• Control the variation in a manner commensurate with the risk it 
represents to the process and product 
• The degree of control over those attributes or parameters should 
be commensurate with their risk to the process and process 
output. In other words, a higher degree of control is appropriate 
for attributes or parameters that pose a higher risk. 
This guidance also establishes that:
• Risk analysis tools can be used to screen potential variables 
for DOE studies to minimize the total number of experiments 
conducted while maximizing knowledge gained. 
• Qualification of utilities and equipment can be covered under 
individual plans or as part of an overall project plan. The plan 
should consider the requirements of use and can incorporate 
risk management to prioritize certain activities and to identify 
a level of effort in both the performance and documentation of 
qualification activities. 
• The sampling plan, including sampling points, number of 
samples, and the frequency of sampling for each unit operation 
and attribute. The number of samples should be adequate to 
provide sufficient statistical confidence of quality both within 
a batch and between batches. The confidence level selected can 
be based on risk analysis as it relates to the particular attribute 
under examination. Sampling during this stage should be more 
extensive than is typical during routine production.200  Chapter Seven
The European Union’s Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice, Annex 15 
(European Commission 2015) also refers to the use of risk management in 
validation, stating:
“A quality risk management approach should be applied through￾out the lifecycle of a medicinal product. As part of a quality risk 
management system, decisions on the scope and extent of qualifi￾cation and validation should be based on a justified and docu￾mented risk assessment of the facilities, equipment, utilities and 
processes. Retrospective validation is no longer considered an 
acceptable approach.”
Risk management is an essential tool for qualification and validation of 
aseptic/sterile processes. It provides real benefits to the validation process 
by identifying risks and ensuring that critical risks are controlled. By focus￾ing on managing risks to the patients and users, medical product manufac￾turers can ensure that the right resources are applied at the right place at 
the right time. 
Laboratory Control
The disposition and release to customers of medical products is based 
on tests performed by manufacturers. Most of those tests are performed 
within in-house quality control laboratories, while others are done by 
subcontractors. Quality control laboratories (physic-chemical and micro￾biological) represent one of the most critical areas in any medical product 
manufacturing site. Either false positive or false negative results represent a 
big risk for the organization and need to be carefully assessed.
In the case of false positive results, for example, a “phantom” failure 
of sterility caused by inadequate sample handling, an unnecessary investi￾gation will be generated. Because a sterility failure (for a purportedly sterile 
product) is a critical situation, a high-level investigation will be generated. 
Most of the time, no root cause is found, and those investigations are often 
closed as “inconclusive.” On the other hand, an erroneous test result can 
lead to the distribution to the market of a medical product not meeting its 
predetermined specifications.
Most of these risk considerations should be covered during test method 
qualification and validation, which will provide an elevated confidence 
level on the laboratory capabilities and hence on the results obtained. 
Risk management techniques must be applied to any failure source that 
can affect the accuracy and/or reliability of a laboratory result. For some 
types of medical devices, for example, diagnostic products, this is even 
more critical because an incorrect medical treatment or therapy can be 	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  201
originated from incorrect clinical laboratory test results. Therefore, the 
following risk management questions should be answered during the test 
method validation work:
• What can go wrong during the test?
• How bad is it?
• How often can it happen?
• What can be done to mitigate/reduce the risk?
Packaging and Labeling
There are three main areas where medical product manufacturers can 
benefit from using risk management tools to evaluate packaging and 
labeling elements:
• Design of packages and product literature. To design the secondary 
package for the protection of primary packaged product (for 
example, to ensure product authenticity, label legibility)
• Selection of container closure system. To determine the critical 
parameters of the container closure system
• Label controls. To design label control procedures based on the 
potential for mix-ups involving different product labels, including 
different versions of the same label
A clear example is the regulatory requirements for so-called over-the￾counter (OTC) products, where FDA regulation includes the requirement 
for tamper-evident packaging of OTC drug products. The reason is to 
improve the security of OTC drug packaging and help assure the safety 
and effectiveness of OTC drug products. Among the requirements:
Each manufacturer and packer who packages an OTC drug 
product for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper￾evident package, if this product is accessible to the public while 
held for sale. A tamper-evident package is one having one or 
more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, 
can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to 
consumers that tampering has occurred. To reduce the likelihood 
of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that 
consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the 
package is required to be distinctive by design or by the use of one 
or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying 202  Chapter Seven
characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, registered trademark, logo, 
or picture). For purposes of this section, the term “distinctive by 
design” means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly 
available materials or through commonly available processes. A 
tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container and 
closure system or secondary-container or carton system or any 
combination of systems intended to provide a visual indication of 
package integrity. The tamper-evident feature shall be designed 
to and shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner 
during manufacture, distribution, and retail display.
(1) In addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any two-piece, hard 
gelatin capsule covered by this section must be sealed using an 
acceptable tamper-evident technology.
(c) Labeling. (1) In order to alert consumers to the specific 
tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an OTC 
drug product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant 
in crushable glass ampules, containers of compressed medical 
oxygen, or aerosol products that depend upon the power of a lique￾fied or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container) is 
required to bear a statement that:
(i) Identifies all tamper-evident feature(s) and any capsule 
sealing technologies used to comply with paragraph (b) of 
this section;
(ii) Is prominently placed on the package; and
(iii) Is so placed that it will be unaffected if the tamper￾evident feature of the package is breached or missing.
(2) If the tamper-evident feature chosen to meet the require￾ments in paragraph (b) of this section uses an identifying charac￾teristic, that characteristic is required to be referred to in the 
labeling statement. For example, the labeling statement on a bottle 
with a shrink band could say “For your protection, this bottle has 
an imprinted seal around the neck.” 
Materials
Control of raw materials and components is an essential step to maintaining 
safety of medical products (Beck et al. 2009). Thorough knowledge of raw 
materials can mitigate the potential for contamination (microbiological, 
chemical, and physical). Raw material control for safety also includes 
identification—being able to verify that you have received the correct 
material—because a mix-up due to the presence of an incorrectly identified 
material in a manufacturing process could compromise safety. Control of 	 Practical Applications of QRM to the Life Science Manufacturing Industry  203
raw materials is essential to ensure lot-to-lot consistency because variation 
in them can directly affect the variation of both product and process. An 
effective raw material control program will also ensure consistent supplies. 
A single source for a vital raw material can be a significant financial and 
quality assurance risk. If a supplier goes out of business or experiences 
quality issues, can that raw material be obtained elsewhere? Has a second 
source been qualified in case the primary source is no longer available? 
Does the second source have the capacity to meet your needs?
Some uses of risk management techniques for materials are:
• To determine whether it is appropriate to use material under 
quarantine (for example, for further internal processing)
• To determine the appropriateness of reprocessing, reworking, or use 
of returned goods
• To assess the adequacy of arrangements for ensuring the 
maintenance of appropriate storage and transport conditions (for 
example, temperature, humidity, container design)
• To determine the stability of the raw materials and components
• To determine whether a raw material is new to the process or a 
result of a change to an existing raw material (if the result of a 
change, what studies have been executed to assure comparability?)
• To determine if the use of the raw material in a manufacturing 
environment presents safety and/or handling risks
SERVICING
Servicing is a regulatory requirement for certain medical device products. 
It means repair and maintenance activities for such devices. When servicing 
is a specified requirement, information from risk management activities 
should be considered. Periodic servicing and maintenance as a means to 
ensure safe functioning of a device can be a method of risk control. 
If a certain risk control measure is necessary for a production process, 
it may also be necessary to apply the same (or similar) risk control measure 
to the servicing process. When there is a hazard to service personnel, clear 
instructions need to be included in service manuals or documentation, and 
appropriate training provided.

Risk Management
Is More Than FMEA
Since the first notions and requirements for risk analysis of medical 
products came around, many regulated companies (if not most of 
them) started to use the failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) 
methodology to accomplish those new tasks.
While this tool can have many good uses, there are also several typical 
misuses. The most notorious (and widely practiced) is to believe that using 
only FMEA for the entire risk management process is appropriate. FMEA 
is a good risk analysis tool, but alone it cannot sustain the risk management 
program. During audits and inspections, many regulated companies often 
present their FMEAs to inspectors as their whole risk management system. 
A sound and effective risk management program needs definitively more 
than good FMEAs.
Comment 83 in FDA’s Preamble to QSR 21 CFR 820 states that:
When conducting a risk analysis, manufacturers are expected 
to identify possible hazards associated with the design in both 
normal and fault conditions. The risks associated with the hazards, 
including those resulting from user error, should then be calculated 
in both normal and fault conditions [emphasis added]. If any risk 
is judged unacceptable, it should be reduced to acceptable levels 
by the appropriate means, for example, by redesign or warnings. 
An important part of risk analysis is ensuring that changes made 
to eliminate or minimize hazards do not introduce new hazards. 
Tools for conducting such analyses include Failure Mode Effect 
Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis, among others.
The standard FMEA process addresses only fault condition hazards and 
not normal condition hazards. Another shortcoming of this tool is that it 
addresses only single-fault condition hazards. In addition, the standard 
205206  Chapter Eight
FMEA is not the best tool for documenting risks that are not failure modes 
(Bills, Mastrangelo, and Wu 2015).
ICH Q9(R1): Quality Risk Management, adopted by FDA in 2006 and 
revised in 2023, summarizes some of the most common risk management 
tools. Among the tools mentioned is FMEA.
FDA writes in section I.2: 
FMEA provides for an evaluation of potential failure modes for 
processes and their likely effect on outcomes and/or product 
performance. Once failure modes are established, risk reduction 
can be used to eliminate, contain, reduce, or control the potential 
failures. FMEA relies on product and process understanding. It 
methodically breaks down the analysis of complex processes 
into manageable steps. It is a powerful tool for summarizing the 
important modes of failure, factors causing these failures, and the 
likely effects of these failures. 
Furthermore, it mentions that FMEA can be used to prioritize risks and 
monitor the effectiveness of risk control activities. 
Here are excerpts from two Warning Letters issued by FDA regarding 
the incorrect application of the FMEA tool during the past decade:
1. Lack of integration of the FMEA process with a performance test. 
An organization received customer complaints about its tubing, which 
was assembled incorrectly. As part of the investigation, the organization 
conducted a performance test, the result of which showed that the incorrect 
assembly did not affect the product. 
But the organization did not update its FMEA, which stated that the 
incorrect assembly compromised the functionality of the device. Thus, it 
left itself vulnerable to future occurrences of the same issue.
2. Lack of definition of the FMEA indexes for severity, occurrence, 
and detectability. An organization received customer complaints about 
device failures, so it rushed to develop a reactive FMEA based solely on 
the major cause of the complaints: contamination.
When it developed the scales to rank severity, occurrence, and 
detectability, it did not provide a rationale for each scale. The organization 
only provided the indexes and the calculated RPN.Risk Management Is More Than FMEA  207
In summary, FMEA alone is not enough to guarantee either product safety 
or quality. While FMEA is a proactive tool within an organization’s risk 
management system (mainly used during the risk analysis stage), it is a 
dynamic component that must be handled correctly using the following tips:
• Perform an FMEA using a teamwork approach.
• Use a systematic method to complete the FMEA with help from a 
process map and cause-and-effect matrix.
• Prioritize the order in which the process inputs will be evaluated 
using the FMEA tool.
• Sort RPNs in descending order.
• Identify all potential root causes. 
• Identify and implement CAPAs for each root cause.
• Recalculate RPNs after CAPAs are implemented, not before.
Doing so will ensure that your FMEA is as effective as possible and your 
products are safe in the hands of the people they’re meant to help.Appendix A
General Examples
Quality risk management requires the manufacturer to establish a 
list of known and foreseeable hazards associated with the medical 
products produced. Furthermore, the manufacturer must also 
consider the foreseeable sequences of events that could lead to hazardous 
situations and, ultimately, harm. A hazard cannot result in harm until such 
a sequence of events leads to a hazardous situation. At this stage the risk 
can be assessed by estimating the severity and probability of occurrence 
of the harm as well as the overall detectability of the hazardous situation. 
Figure A.1 represents the relationships between the main elements involved 
in the determination of risk, where P1 is the probability of a hazardous 
situation occurring, and P2 is the probability of a hazardous situation lead￾ing to harm.

209210  Appendix A
The starting point for this assessment should include a review of 
the risk history of similar types of medical products. Table A.1 is an 
example of the initial list of hazards. After that, it is possible to initiate the 
identification of some of the chain of events that along with hazards could 
result in a hazardous situation and, finally, harm. Analysis and identifi￾cation can be further complicated by the many initiating events and circum￾stances that have to be taken into consideration, such as those listed in 
Table A.2. Table A.3 includes some examples of the relationships between 
hazards, sequence of events, hazardous situations, and harm (International 
Organization for Standardization 2019a).
Although this compilation of the list of hazards, hazardous situations, 
and sequences should be performed as early as possible in the design stage, 
in practice it is an ongoing activity that will continue throughout post￾manufacturing stages. Table A.4 summarizes the attributes and potential 
applications of the most frequently used risk management tools, while 
Table A.5 represents an example of qualitative risk component ranking. 
Finally, Table A.6 contains an example of determination of risk priority 
ranking based on probability of occurrence and the detectability of the 
failure mode.General Examples  211

Quality Risk Management 
Case Study
The following case study presents the analysis for the prevention of 
risks due to potential cross-contamination between drugs, carried 
out by Business Excellence Consulting Inc. during the period 
of May 29 to June 2, 2023, at the facilities of XYZ Worldwide Generics 
Limited located in International Quality Building, Anywhere PR. The 
material is divided into sections following the logical sequence in which 
the project was developed.
INTRODUCTION
Whenever production of a single product needs the entire capacity of a 
facility, issues of potential cross-contamination are of less concern. How￾ever, when two or more products are to be manufactured in one facility, one 
room within a facility, or using common equipment (linked or separate), 
the potential for cross-contamination becomes a significant issue for 
consideration. Consistent with the principles embodied in ISPE’s Risk￾Based Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products (Risk-MaPP) and FDA’s 
Q9(R1) Quality Risk Management Guidance for Industry, a systematic 
approach is needed to provide guidance in the identification of risks 
requiring control strategies to manage them effectively. This should be 
applied at all stages in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Such 
an approach includes risk assessments that are formally conducted to assist 
with the identification, implementation, and verification of appropriate risk 
control strategies as part of the overall risk management process.
During an assessment of XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited’s quality 
risk management procedure, performed by Business Excellence Consulting 
Inc. on April 18, 2023, it was found that the process to prevent potential 
cross-contamination between drugs could be further improved. The risk 
219220  Appendix B
assessment was performed during the period of May 29 to June 2, 2023, 
by Business Excellence Consulting Inc. It follows a systematic approach, 
using the FDA’s Q9(R1) Quality Risk Management Guidance for Industry, 
ISPE’s Risk-Based Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products, Six Sigma 
principles, and quality by design (QbD) concepts. 
QUALITY RISK
MANAGEMENT MODEL
Quality risk management (QRM) is a systematic process for the assess￾ment, control, communication, and review of risks to the quality of the 
drug product across the product life cycle. A model for QRM based on 
FDA’s Q9 Quality Risk Management Guidance for Industry is outlined in 
Figure B.1.
The scope of this case study is to complete the first two steps of the 
QRM process: 
1. Initiate the QRM process 
2. Conduct a risk assessment
The other steps are out of the scope of this case study (risk control, risk 
communication, and risk review) are mentioned only for informational 
purposes in this section. However, XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited will 
be responsible for implementing the actions required to complete these 
steps as part of their QRM process. All the steps in the QRM model, along 
with the tools used in each one, are described within the next pages.
1. Initiate Quality Risk Management Process
The QRM activities are undertaken by interdisciplinary teams. When 
teams are formed, they should include experts from the appropriate areas 
(for example, quality unit, business development, engineering, regulatory 
affairs, production operations, sales and marketing, legal, statistics, and so 
on) in addition to individuals who are knowledgeable about the quality risk 
management process.
The QRM should include systematic processes designed to coordinate, 
facilitate, and improve science-based decision-making with respect to 
risk. Some steps used to initiate and plan a QRM process might include 
the following:
• Define the problem and/or risk question, including pertinent 
assumptions identifying the potential for riskQuality Risk Management Case Study  221
• Assemble background information and/or data on the potential 
hazard, harm, or human health impact relevant to the risk 
assessment
• Identify a leader and critical resources
• Specify a timeline, deliverables, and appropriate level of 
decision-making for the risk management process

Figure B.1 Overview of a typical quality risk management (QRM) process.222  Appendix B
The case study herein starts with a risk management charter, which 
presents the rationale for this risk assessment. Along with the interdisci￾plinary team members, the charter includes the business case, problem 
statement, goal statement, scope, benefits, and project plan. Figure B.2 
shows the risk management charter for this case study.
2. Risk Assessment
Risk assessment consists of the identification of hazards and the analysis 
and evaluation of risks associated with exposure to those hazards. QRM 
begins with a well-defined problem description or risk question. When 
the risk in question is well defined, an appropriate risk management tool 
and the types of information that will address the risk question will be 
more readily identifiable. As an aid to clearly defining the risk(s) for risk 
assessment purposes, three fundamental questions are often helpful:
1. What might go wrong?
2. What is the likelihood (probability) it will go wrong?
3. What are the consequences (severity)?
The answers to these questions will be obtained throughout the risk assess￾ment. Now, let us break the risk assessment step into more specific substeps.
Risk Identification. Risk identification is a systematic use of informa￾tion to identify hazards referring to the risk question or problem descrip￾tion. Information can include historical data, theoretical analysis, informed 
opinions, and the concerns of stakeholders. Risk identification addresses 
the “What might go wrong?” question, including identifying the possible 
consequences. This provides the basis for further steps in the QRM process.
To start the risk identification phase, a process map showing all the 
process steps and process inputs (factors) for each step was developed. 
The importance of the process map is to identify all the input variables 
that could go wrong and have an impact on the product quality. Figure B.3 
shows a partial view of the process map for this case study.
Once all the process steps and inputs were identified, each one was 
analyzed through a cause-and-effect matrix (also called C&E matrix or 
prioritization matrix). Each process input was analyzed against its relation￾ship to prevent potential cross-contamination between drugs. The C&E 
matrix is used to filter all the important variables that influence the critical￾to-quality (CTQ) output variables; in this case, it is to prevent potential 
cross-contamination by any of the following routes of exposure: product 
mix-up, retention in the equipment, mechanical transfer, and airborne Quality Risk Management Case Study  223

Business Case: Problem Statement:
Whenever production of a single product needs the entire capacity of a facility, issues of 
cross-contamination are of less concern. However, when two or more products are to be 
manufactured in one facility, one room within a facility, or by using common equipment, the 
potential for cross-contamination becomes a significant issue for consideration. Consistent 
with the principles embodied in ISPE’s Risk-Based Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products and 
FDA’s ICH Q9 guidance, a systematic approach is needed to provide support in the identification 
of risks requiring control strategies to manage them effectively. This should be applied at 
all stages in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Such an approach includes risk 
assessments that are formally conducted to assist with the identification, implementation, and 
verification of appropriate risk control strategies as part of the risk management process.
During an external assessment of the Quality Risk Management process at 
XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited, held by Business Excellence Consulting 
Inc. on 18/APR/2023, it was found that the current process to prevent cross￾contamination between drug products can be further improved.

used for the C&E matrix are illustrated in Figure B.4. A partial view of the 
unsorted C&E matrix is illustrated in Figure B.5.
This step is completed prior to performing a failure mode and effects 
analysis (FMEA). By using the C&E matrix, no input is left behind in 
the risk assessment. The tool considers inputs that have gone wrong and 
those inputs that might go wrong. Once the C&E matrix is completed, the 
weighted scores are sorted in descending order and classified as to the rela￾tionships between the possible failure of the input variables (factors) and 
their potential to cause cross-contamination between drugs: strong rela￾tionship, moderate relationship, low relationship, or no relationship. 
To determine which ranking was assigned, the following rationale 
was used: 
• For weighted scores that have at least one rating of 9, a strong 
relationship was assigned. 
• For weighted scores with no rating of 9 but at least one rating of 3, 
a moderate relationship was assigned. 
• For weighted scores with no ratings of 9 or 3, but at least one 
rating of 1, a low relationship was assigned.
• For weighted scores with all ratings of zero, no relationship 
was assigned.

Risk Analysis. Risk analysis is the estimation of the risk associated with 
the identified hazards. It is the qualitative or quantitative process of linking 
the likelihood of occurrence and severity of harms. In some risk 
management tools, the ability to detect the harm (detectability) also factors 
in the estimation of risk.
From the C&E matrix developed for the risk assessment, those input 
variables that have a strong relationship with potential cross-contamination 
between drugs were analyzed through an FMEA. Using this risk 
assessment tool, each input was analyzed in terms of its potential failure 
mode. Once the failure mode was identified, the effects of potential cross￾contamination between drugs were analyzed in terms of their severity 
to both the product quality and the patient safety. Then, the potential 
causes for the failure mode were identified, along with their probability 
of occurrence. Finally, the current controls (if any) were addressed and 
evaluated in terms of their effectiveness to prevent or detect the failure 
mode. The severity, occurrence, and detectability ratings are illustrated in 
Figure B.7.

Once all the ratings were assigned, a risk priority number (RPN) was 
calculated for each of the process inputs using the following formula:
RPN = Severity × Probability of Occurrence × Detectability
A partial view of the unsorted FMEA is illustrated in Figure B.8.
Risk Evaluation. Risk evaluation compares the identified and analyzed 
risk against given risk criteria. Risk evaluations consider the strength of 
evidence for all three of the fundamental questions previously mentioned. 
Once all the RPNs are calculated, they must be sorted in descending order.
The purpose of sorting the RPNs in descending order on the FMEA 
developed during the risk analysis step is to rank them by their impact on 
risk. To determine which risk ranking was assigned (high, medium, or 
low), the following rationale was used: for RPN values lower than 30, a 
low-risk classification was assigned; for RPN values between 30 and 59, 
a medium-risk classification was assigned; for those RPN values of 60 or 
above, a high-risk classification was assigned. Also, regardless of the RPN 
value, for any potential failure effect with a severity value of 5, a high-risk 
classification was assigned. A partial view of the sorted FMEA is illus￾trated in Figure B.9.
The systematic approach used for this risk assessment is based on 
the article titled “Fail-Safe FMEA” written by José Rodríguez-Pérez and 
Manuel E. Peña-Rodríguez, published in the January 2012 issue of Quality 
Progress magazine, which is distributed monthly by the American Society 
for Quality (ASQ). 
3. Risk Control
Risk control includes decision-making to reduce and/or accept risks. The 
purpose of risk control is to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The 
amount of effort used for risk control should be proportional to the signifi￾cance of the risk. Decision-makers might use different processes, including 
benefit-risk analysis, for understanding the optimal level of risk control.
Risk Reduction. Risk reduction focuses on processes for mitigation or 
avoidance of quality risk when it exceeds a specified, or acceptable, level. 
Risk reduction might include actions taken to mitigate the severity and 
probability of harm. Processes that improve the detectability of hazards 
and quality risks might also be used as part of a risk control strategy. The 
implementation of risk reduction measures can introduce new risks into the230  Appendix B Project Name: Prevention of cross-contamination between drug products FMEA Team: See Quality Risk Management Charter Responsibility: John Doe Prepared By: Manuel E.

system or increase the significance of other existing risks. Hence, it might 
be appropriate to revisit the risk assessment to identify and evaluate any 
possible change in risk after implementing a risk reduction process.
Risk Acceptance. Risk acceptance is a decision to accept risk. Risk 
acceptance can be a formal decision to accept the residual risk or it can 
be a passive decision in which residual risks are not specified. For some 
types of harms, even the best QRM practices might not entirely eliminate 
risk. In these circumstances, it might be agreed that an appropriate QRM 
strategy has been applied and that quality risk is reduced to a specified, or 
acceptable, level. This specified, or acceptable, level will depend on many 
parameters and should be decided on a case-by-case basis.
For all those inputs with a high risk described in the sorted FMEA, 
the company shall identify ways to control the risks (that is, implement risk 
reduction and risk acceptance activities). For those inputs with moderate 
risk, the company must decide for which of them risk control actions will 
be implemented. Then, for those inputs with low risk, no actions might be 
required at this time because those risks are considered acceptable.
4. Risk Communication
Risk communication is the sharing of information about risk and risk 
management between the decision-makers and others. Parties can commu￾nicate at any stage of the risk management process. The output/result of 
the QRM process should be appropriately communicated and documented. 
Communications might include those among interested parties (for example, 
regulators and industry; industry and the patient; within a company, 
industry, or regulatory authority). The included information might relate 
to the existence, nature, form, probability, severity, acceptability, control, 
treatment, detectability, or other aspects of risks to quality. Communication 
need not be carried out for each and every risk acceptance. Between the 
industry and regulatory authorities, communication concerning QRM 
decisions might be accomplished through existing channels, as specified in 
regulations and guidances.
5. Risk Review
Risk management should be an ongoing part of the quality management 
process. A mechanism to review or monitor events should be implemented. 
The output/results of the risk management process should be reviewed to 
take into account new knowledge and experience. Once a QRM process 
has been initiated, that process should continue to be utilized for events 
that might impact the original QRM decision, whether these events are Quality Risk Management Case Study  233
planned (for example, results of product review, inspections, audits, change 
control) or unplanned (for example, root cause from failure investigations, 
recall). The frequency of any review should be based on the level of risk. 
Risk review might include reconsideration of risk acceptance decisions.
It is recommended to integrate the risk management process with 
the corrective actions and preventive actions (CAPA) system. Although 
both systems can operate as separate entities, the best results are obtained 
when the proactive risk management process is integrated with the CAPA 
system. In this way, potential failures can be identified and prevented 
before they do occur. Figure B.10 shows the interrelationship between the 
risk management process and the CAPA system.

Risk Assessment Results
During the risk assessment stage of the risk management process for 
potential cross-contamination between drugs carried out at the facilities of 
XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited, many opportunities for improvement 
were identified. The risk management process began with the elaboration 
of a process map, in which the process steps and the input variables (factors) 
of each of these process steps were identified. Then, through a cause-and￾effect matrix, we identified which of the input variables of the different 
process steps could have a certain type of relationship in terms of potential 234  Appendix B
cross-contamination between drugs. Once those input variables that have 
a strong and direct relationship with the potential cross-contamination 
between drugs were identified, they were evaluated in terms of their risk 
level. For this, an FMEA was developed. All the inputs in the FMEA were 
evaluated for the risk of potential cross-contamination between drugs. The 
purpose of the FMEA was to identify the level of risk contributed by each 
of the analyzed variables, as well as to identify the potential causes of these 
failures and the current controls to prevent or detect such causes or their 
potential failure modes. 
Using FEMA (including only high- and moderate-risk variables), 
several Pareto diagrams were developed to analyze the data, find 
opportunities for improvement, and prioritize the order in which the 
improvement plans should be established. The Pareto diagrams developed 
and explained within this case study are:
• Pareto Diagram by Process Step
• Pareto Diagram by Process Input
• Pareto Diagram by Process Input Category
• Pareto Diagram by Potential Failure Effect
• Pareto Diagram by Potential Failure Mode
• Pareto Diagram by Potential Causes
• Pareto Diagram by Current Controls
• Pareto Diagram by Current Controls Type
• Pareto Diagram by Severity Index
• Pareto Diagram by Probability of Occurrence Index
• Pareto Diagram by Detectability Index
For each of the Pareto diagrams included within this case study, a brief 
narrative is presented about the evaluation of the results obtained by 
analyzing those diagrams. Likewise, a series of recommendations are 
presented to mitigate or eliminate the risk of potential cross-contamination 
between drugs for each of those Pareto diagrams. It is important to empha￾size that they are simply recommendations and that XYZ Worldwide 
Generics Limited will be responsible for identifying the required actions 
and developing the appropriate plans for its implementation and for the 
subsequent effectiveness verification of such actions.Quality Risk Management Case Study  235
ANALYSIS BY PROCESS STEP
Figure B.11 shows the Pareto diagram of those stages of the process for 
which a high or moderate risk was determined, because they obtained 
a risk priority number (RPN) equal to or greater than 30 in the FMEA. 
When analyzing the Pareto diagram, it can be observed that a cumulative 
75.1 percent of the total risk is reflected in the areas of:

This is not uncommon, because at these stages of the process the 
raw materials are exposed to the work environment; thus, potential cross￾contamination can occur through direct contact between the materials. 
The remaining 24.9 percent corresponds to areas where potential cross￾contamination between drugs can occur through indirect contact. 
Therefore, the more rigid controls should be established in these areas 
where potential cross-contamination between drugs can occur through direct 
contact with the product: manufacturing, primary packing, and dispensing.236  Appendix B
ANALYSIS BY PROCESS INPUT
Figure B.12 shows the Pareto diagram categorized by the different input 
variables (factors) that were identified for all the processes. It can be seen 
that the most frequent process input is operators (P). Also, the first eight 
variables include each of the process input types: Material, Personnel, 
Facilities/Environment, and Equipment. 
A more specific Pareto diagram by process input category is presented 
in Figure B.13. In this figure, the individual process inputs were combined 
in categories: material, personnel, facilities/environment, and equipment. 
In this way, those process input categories with the highest risk can be 
identified. Each of the process input category variables will be explained 
in more detail. 
From Figure B.13, those process inputs (factors) related to equipment 
(E) represent 52.4 percent of the total, while personnel (P) represents 28.3 
percent, material (M) represents 11.9 percent, and facilities/environment 
(F) represents 5.9 percent of the total. Let us now evaluate each of these 
categories individually:
1. Equipment (E): Most of the potential cross-contamination 
related to equipment deals with inadequate cleaning caused by 
procedures not followed or procedures not clear. This type of 
situation produces potential cross-contamination by the retention 
in the equipment. The sorted FMEA tables shown in the final 
report show that for those inputs whose potential failure effect 
was cross-contamination due to retention in equipment, the 
potential failure causes are “procedure not followed,” “inadequate 
procedure,” “person not trained,” and “cleaning requirements 
not identified.” Because XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited has 
more than 500 different manufacturing equipment and produces 
over 1,000 different products (tablets and capsules), equipment 
cleaning is of the utmost importance. It is recommended to review 
the procedures related to equipment cleaning to ensure they 
provide enough details. It is also recommended that those cleaning 
procedures be as visual as possible. In addition, training on 
procedures (if revised) must be provided to all personnel involved 
in equipment cleaning operations. Finally, an effectiveness 
evaluation of those trainings must be included as part of the 
training process.Quality Risk Management Case Study  237Figure B.12 Pareto diagram by process input.

2. Personnel (P): Most of the potential cross-contamination related 
to personnel deals with contamination due to product mix-up. The 
FMEA in the final report shows that most of the potential failure 
modes for the potential cross-contamination due to mix-up relate 
to wrong selection of components, dispensing wrong components, 
wrong labeling, and so on. In most cases, the potential causes of 
that failure mode are related to human performance: inadequate 
training, work overload, procedure not followed, lack of alertness, 
and so on. To deal with those potential causes related to human 
performance issues, it is recommended to implement double￾checks in those operations prone to human errors. Also, make 
certain these critical tasks where cross-contamination due to 
mix-up can occur are adequately supervised.
3. Material (M): Most of the potential cross-contamination 
related to material deals with contamination due to mix-up 
and mechanical transfer. The FMEA in the final report shows 
that for those inputs related to materials, the most common 
potential failure modes are related to wrong labeling and use of 
contaminated polybags. As with the previously discussed issues 
related to personnel, it is recommended that the company address 
the potential failure causes by implementing double-checks in 
certain operations.Quality Risk Management Case Study  239
4. Facilities/Environment (F): Looking at the final report, it can be 
noted that most potential cross-contamination related to facilities/
environment results in mechanical transfer issues. The most 
common potential failure modes identified with this situation 
are material spillage and residues from previous product. Most 
of the potential causes are human-related: inadequate handling 
of materials, improper cleaning, procedure not followed, and 
so on. As with the previous process input types, this specific 
potential failure cause will be addressed with providing adequate 
supervision and improved training, followed by a training 
effectiveness evaluation.
ANALYSIS BY
POTENTIAL FAILURE EFFECT
Figure B.14 shows the Pareto diagram by potential failure effects. As can 
be seen in the diagram, 46.8 percent of the high and moderate risk of 
potential cross-contamination between drugs is associated with potential 
contamination by retention in the equipment, 28.3 percent is due to mech￾anical transfer, and the remaining 24.9 percent is related to potential con￾tamination by product mix-up. As mentioned earlier, with more than 
500 pieces of manufacturing equipment in the production areas, cleaning 
becomes an important consideration to avoid potential cross-contamination 
due to retention in the equipment. Following is a description of each of the 
potential failure effect categories.
Cross-contamination by retention in the equipment is defined as the 
transfer of those residues of material on the contact surfaces of one product 
to another, in the same equipment used in a sequential or campaign way. 
The factors that cause cross-contamination due to retention in the equip￾ment are mainly related to the effectiveness of the cleaning procedures and 
their application by the related personnel after completing a campaign, and 
include the cleaning of by-products or residues of cleaning material, as well 
as waste of the product. The development of adequate cleaning systems is 
an important area in pharmaceutical manufacturing. To avoid this type of 
cross-contamination, cleaning procedures must be developed to provide the 
right cleaning agent under the right conditions for effective cleaning. This 
requires knowledge of the “cleanliness” of the compound. Studies should be 
conducted to evaluate the properties required to remove a compound using 
various surface-cleaning agents and surface finishes. Cleaning processes 
that have been optimized by selecting the best cleaning agents and cleaning 
parameters offer the greatest ability to uniformly reduce product waste to 240  Appendix B

the lowest risk levels. Before use, cleaning procedures should be subject to 
risk assessments to identify and assess the risk of failure, improve them as 
necessary, and make them more reliable and robust.
On the other side, the cross-contamination by mechanical transfer 
includes contact surfaces of the product that have been contaminated by 
contact with other contaminated surfaces (for example, in cleaning areas), 
inadvertent or transient contact with other nondesignated contaminated 
contact areas of the product, and direct contact of the product with other 
surfaces, such as staff gowning and/or gloves. The risk of cross-contami￾nation by mechanical transfer can occur with the co-location of a process 
with contaminated equipment or articles; for example, operators who wear 
contaminated gowning or contact between process equipment contami￾nated with different materials. Some factors that usually contribute to 
cross-contamination by mechanical transfer include:
• Use of common areas where the segregation of processes and 
equipment is deficient; for example, common areas of manual 
cleaning where dirty and clean equipment of different processes 
can be present at the same time
• Use of common gowning roomsQuality Risk Management Case Study  241
• Use of common equipment; for example, hand tools or exchanging 
pieces between different processes
The use of certain equipment may cause operators or mobile equipment to 
become contaminated. This could then potentially transit to other process 
areas without undergoing decontamination procedures. Issues to be consid￾ered include:
• The presence of highly manual, uncontained/open processes
• The specification and location of decontamination procedures for 
users and equipment
• Routing of equipment and users around facilities especially where 
there is common routing of product
Finally, cross-contamination by product mix-up is frequently cited by 
regulators as one of the most common causes for regulatory action and/or 
product recall. Product mix-up refers to the contamination at unsafe levels 
of one product with another. The highest risks from mix-up normally stem 
from failures due to basic human failures (for example, not following proce￾dure) or system weakness (for example, poor material labeling). Obviously, 
there is an increased potential risk of cross-contamination if two or more 
products are being handled in the same area, even with appropriate batch 
to batch segregation. With a catalog of more than 1,000 different products 
at XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited, the potential of cross-contamination 
due to mix-up takes on important relevance. The risk analysis to identify 
potential cross-contamination routes should include a review of basic 
practices to confirm that appropriate systems provide a high level of 
assurance that mix-up will not occur, such as:
• Identification and status labeling and controls of materials and 
products
• Status labeling and controls of equipment and facilities
• Receipt and controls of materials and products
• Physical segregation, process flow, and security during material and 
product handling, storage, and staging
The actions necessary to avoid each of these routes of potential cross￾contamination will be addressed specifically during the risk control phase 
of the QRM process by XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited. An action 
plan, including the actions, responsible person, target completion dates, 
and actions taken, will be part of the FMEA file. Once those actions are 
implemented and their effectiveness is evaluated, the severity, occurrence, 242  Appendix B
and detectability indices must be re-evaluated and the RPNs recalculated. 
This process must be continuously revised, especially when new process 
changes are implemented and whenever new risks are identified.
ANALYSIS BY
POTENTIAL FAILURE MODE
Figure B.15 shows the Pareto diagram by potential failure modes. As 
can be seen in the diagram, the most frequent potential failure mode is 
“Equipment not properly cleaned” (46 percent), followed by “Contaminated 
gowning” (10 percent) and “Wrong selection of components” (9 percent).
These three potential failure modes are directly linked to the three 
potential failure effects presented in Figure B.14 (potential cross-contami￾nation by retention in the equipment, by mechanical transfer, and by 
product mix-up).
When all the potential failure modes presented in Figure B.15 are 
analyzed in general terms, most of them are directly related to human 
factors, either due to not following the corresponding procedures (SOPs)

or inadequate cleaning of the equipment. Therefore, we recommend that 
XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited reinforce training for all staff about the 
importance of proper execution of established procedures, as well as on the 
adequate cleaning of work areas and equipment.
ANALYSIS BY POTENTIAL CAUSES
Figure B.16 shows the Pareto diagram for potential causes. The first four 
potential failure causes represent a cumulative 56 percent of the total causes. 
These causes are listed below, in the descending order in which they 
appear in the Pareto diagram:
1. Procedure not followed (20 percent)
2. Inadequate procedure (13 percent)
3. Person not trained (12 percent)
4. Cleaning requirements not identified (12 percent)
Out of the top four potential causes, three of them deal with procedures 
(procedure not followed, inadequate procedure, and cleaning requirements 
not identified). Therefore, it is recommended that XYZ Worldwide 
Generics Limited evaluate cleaning procedures and make sure to establish 
the appropriate controls to avoid these potential failure causes. Among
those controls, operator training is imperative because the potential failure 
cause called “Person not trained,” which is the third potential cause in 
descending order in the Pareto diagram, accounts for 12 percent of the total 
potential causes. Once the controls are established, the company is required 
to measure the effectiveness of these controls. Finally, it is recommended 
that XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited update the table of the FMEA 
and reassign the occurrence and detectability indexes to recalculate the 
RPNs once the actions have been implemented and their effectiveness has 
been verified. 
From the sorted FMEA table in the final report, it can be seen that for 
those factors with RPN values above 60, the current controls index assigned 
to all of them was 3, which was defined as “Procedure exists, is done and 
registered, but details are missing.” In other words, procedure exists and 
is executed, but the procedure needs some improvement. By updating the 
procedures and providing adequate training and supervision, the current 
controls index could be lowered to a value of 2, which means “There is a 
procedure, the action is performed and recorded.” Therefore, the new RPN 
for those factors would be 50, which means that risk has been reduced from 
high to moderate.244  Appendix B

ANALYSIS BY CURRENT CONTROLS
Figure B.17 shows the Pareto diagram for current controls. It can be noted 
that the three most common procedures mentioned through the FMEA are 
the following:
• QA013-12 – Training
• PR152-18 – Packaging procedure
• PR005-13 – Entry and exit from production block and process area 
for factory personnel
Precisely, these controls are directly linked with some of the most common 
potential causes identified in Figure B.16. In fact, an adequate implemen￾tation of QA013-12 will be fundamental in reducing the potential failure 
cause related to “Person not trained.”
When looking at Figure B.17, many procedures are listed one, two, 
or three times. This makes it difficult to determine if any specific type 
of procedure is referenced more than others. To overcome that confusion, 
Figure B.18 shows the same current controls but presented by procedure 
type. The procedures were classified in one of the following categories:
• Production (PR)
• Quality assurance (QA)
• Warehouse (WH)
• Finished goods (FG)
• Human resources (HR)
From Figure B.18, 71 percent of the procedures listed in the FMEA refer 
to production, most of them related to the cleaning of a specific equipment. 
The 16.5 percent related to quality assurance is just one procedure: 
QA013-12, Training procedure. Another 8.1 percent of the procedures are 
related to warehouse. These procedures are related to: receipt and storage 
of raw and packing material, dispensing of raw materials, entry and exit 
procedure to sampling area, and handling of spillage of materials. It 
is obvious that production procedures are, by far, those with the highest 
impact on preventing potential cross-contamination between drugs. It is 
recommended to revise all procedures related to cleaning, especially those 
related to equipment cleaning. It is expected that after all procedures are 
revised, training on these procedures given to all involved, and effective￾ness evaluation of the training performed, the risks related to inadequate 
equipment cleaning can be reduced to accepted levels.246  Appendix B

The Pareto diagrams presented in the previous sections were developed 
using the information related to those situations for which a high or moder￾ate risk was determined, because they obtained an RPN equal to or greater 
than 30. On the other side, the Pareto diagrams presented next used the 
data for all types of risk: high, moderate, and low. In these diagrams, the 
severity, occurrence, and detectability indices assigned during the develop￾ment of the FMEA will be analyzed.
ANALYSIS BY SEVERITY INDEX
Figure B.19 shows the Pareto diagram by severity index. The following scale
was used to classify the severity as part of the FMEA:
5 = High: High impact to product quality; Injury to patient
4 = Moderate: Moderate impact to product quality; Patient 
dissatisfaction
3 = Low: Low impact to product quality; Likely to result 
in a complaint
2 = Very low: Very low impact to product quality; Minor 
nuisance resulting in no loss
1 = No severity: No impact to product quality; Be unnoticed and 
not affect product performance248  Appendix B

The Pareto diagram shows that in a cumulative 81.8 percent of the 
potential failure effects, the severity is moderate (4), low (3), and very low 
(2). A total of 15.7 percent of potential failure effects have a high severity 
(5). Finally, in 2.4 percent a classification of no severity (1) was assigned. 
All the potential failure effects that were ranked with a severity index of 
5 were related to cross-contamination due to product mix-up. This is the 
riskiest type of cross-contamination in this facility and could be caused 
by either mixing the wrong components in the production area or the 
wrong selection of components in the secondary packaging area. As 
previously mentioned, with a catalog of more than 1,000 different products 
manufactured at XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited, this type of potential 
cross-contamination takes on important relevance.
In most cases where a potential cross-contamination due to retention 
in the equipment and mechanical transfer could occur, a severity index 
of 3 or 4 was assigned. This was because these are not penicillin-related 
products, in which the severity of this type of cross-contamination could 
produce more direct and adverse effects on the patient. Finally, for those 
cases where the potential cross-contamination could be related to airborne 
transfer, a severity index of 2 was assigned. The rationale is because in 
case such cross-contamination occurs, only minor residues of products 
could contaminate other products. Because these are not penicillin-related 
products, the severity of such cross-contamination would be lower. Quality Risk Management Case Study  249
ANALYSIS BY PROBABILITY
OF OCCURRENCE INDEX
While it is important to analyze the severity index, it is also true that you 
must analyze the probability of occurrence and level of detectability of 
potential failures. These three factors are combined to calculate the RPN. 
Figure B.20 shows the Pareto diagram based on the probability of occu￾rrence of potential failure causes. The scale used to classify the probability 
of occurrences was as follows:
5 = Always: More than once per lot
4 = Frequently: Once per lot
3 = Occasionally: Once at least every three to six months
2 = Rarely: Once every one to three years
1 = Never: Once in more than five years
Notice that the indices are based on probability of occurrences, not on actual 
number of occurrences. This is an important aspect to consider because the 
severity, probability of occurrence, and detection indices are independent 
of each other. In most instances, when the failure occurrence rate is low, it 
is because good controls are implemented and followed. However, if those 
controls are removed, the number of occurrences will definitely increase. 
In order to assign the probability of occurrence, the frequency of the tasks 
was considered. For example, spillage can occur more than once per lot, 
because materials are constantly being retrieved and used in the different 
areas. In these types of situations, a probability of occurrence index of 5 
was assigned. However, equipment cleaning happens at the end of the lot. 
So, for these types of situations, a probability of occurrence index of 4 
was assigned.
It should be noted that the scale of probability of occurrence index 
is highly subjective and not necessarily linear. It is just a subjective way 
of identifying how often the failure mode could occur. Analyzing Figure 
B.20, it can be observed that 59.2 percent of the incidents could occur 
frequently (4), or once per lot, and 40.8 percent of the incidents could occur 
always (5), which indicates that the cause of the failure could occur more 
than once per lot. 250  Appendix B

ANALYSIS BY 
DETECTABILITY INDEX
Finally, Figure B.21 shows the Pareto diagram classified by level of detect￾ability. The scale used to classify the detection level was the following:
5 = The current control is not capable of preventing or detecting 
the failure mode.
4 = The action is performed, but there is no procedure defining 
how it is performed.
3 = A procedure exists, is done, and is registered, but details 
are missing.
2 = There is a procedure, and the action is performed 
and recorded.
1 = Control is 100 percent automated.
Analyzing Figure B.21, it can be observed that in 96.7 percent of the 
situations evaluated in the FMEA, there is a procedure, and the action is 
performed and recorded (2). In the remaining 3.3 percent of the situations 
evaluated, the procedure exists, is done, and is registered, but details 
are missing (3). As mentioned earlier, in order to reduce the RPNs, one 
of the most important activities is to reduce the detectability index from Quality Risk Management Case Study  251
3 to 2. It is recommended that XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited evaluate 
procedures (especially, equipment cleaning procedures) to make them 
easier to understand. It is also recommended to XYZ Worldwide Generics 
Limited that the revision of the procedures be linked to a comprehensive 
training program and adequate supervision.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Throughout this case study, a series of recommendations have been offered 
to be evaluated by XYZ Worldwide Generics Limited. Some other recom￾mendations were previously made after evaluating the QRM procedure. 
All these recommendations are summarized here:
Recommendations for the QRM procedure:
• Use a systematic approach to identify which tools are going to 
be used at each stage of the QRM process. Business Excellence 
Consulting Inc. has developed a Risk Management Toolkit and 
provided a copy of the toolkit to XYZ Worldwide Generics 
Limited.
• Use five ratings for each element. Ratings for severity and 
detectability already defined in procedure can be further improved.252  Appendix B
• Business Excellence Consulting Inc. has provided a copy of a 
QRM model procedure, which is included in Appendix D of this 
book. It is recommended to implement this procedure entirely or 
identify the relevant elements and incorporate them in the existing 
QRM procedure. 
Recommendations during the risk assessment:
• Review manufacturing procedures related to equipment cleaning 
and make certain they have enough details. Use visual aids as much 
as possible.
• Review the training status of all personnel and make certain they 
are trained in their tasks, especially cleaning tasks.
• Review training methods to ensure they are aligned to the tasks, 
especially cleaning tasks.
– Use a combination of classroom and on-the-job training, 
as appropriate. 
– Use as many visual aids as possible for training.
– Evaluate training effectiveness.
• Ensure all cleaning activities are adequately supervised.
• Ensure cleaning activities are double-checked by an independent 
person.
• Appoint one person as leader of the QRM process oversight.
• Appoint subject matter experts at each area, responsible for the 
development and maintenance of the FMEAs.
• Implement the QRM procedure model developed by Business 
Excellence Consulting Inc.Appendix C
Fail-Safe FMEA
José Rodríguez-Pérez and 
Manuel E. Peña-Rodríguez
Quality risk management principles are used effectively in many 
areas of business and government—including finance, insurance, 
occupational safety, and public health—and by the agencies regu￾lating these industries.
Risk management’s widespread use isn’t a surprise because every 
product and every process has an associated risk. But while there are 
some examples of the use of quality risk management in the medical 
product manufacturing industry, they are limited and do not take full 
advantage of what risk management has to offer. After all, inadequate or 
ineffective quality risk management can harm patients, product users, and 
company value.
The current focus of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
on risk-based determination requires that regulated industries dramatically 
improve their understanding and use of hazard control concepts. 
The appropriate use of quality risk management can help organizations 
comply with regulatory requirements, such as good manufacturing prac￾tices or good laboratory practices.
Quality risk management is a valuable component of an effective 
quality system’s framework. It can, for example, help guide the setting of 
specifications and process parameters for manufacturing, assess and miti￾gate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the 
extent of deviation investigations and corrective actions. 
An effective quality risk management approach can ensure a high￾quality product by providing a proactive means to identify and control 
potential quality issues during development and manufacturing. Addition￾ally, it can improve decision making if a quality problem arises.
253

EXPLAINING RISK
Risk combines the probability of occurrence of harm with the severity of 
that harm. Quality risk management supports a scientific and practical 
approach to decision-making during the life cycle of a product. It provides 
documented and reproducible methods to accomplish the quality risk 
management process based on current knowledge about the probability, 
severity, and detectability of the risk.
But each stakeholder perceives different potential harms, computes 
different probabilities, and assigns different severities. In relation to 
medical products, although there are many different stakeholders—
including patients, medical practitioners, government, and the industry as 
a whole—protecting the patient by managing risk should always be of the 
utmost importance.1
The manufacture and use of any medical product necessarily involves 
some degree of risk. The risk to product quality is just one component of 
overall risk. Product quality must be maintained throughout the product 
life cycle so the characteristics that are important to product quality remain 
consistent.
Effective quality risk management can also facilitate better and more 
informed decisions, assure regulators of a manufacturer’s ability to deal 
with potential risks, and positively affect the extent and level of regula￾tory oversight.
Manufacturers of regulated products are required to have a quality 
management system and processes for addressing product-related risks. 
These processes for managing risk can evolve into a stand-alone manage￾ment system. While manufacturers may choose to maintain these two 
management systems separately, it may be advantageous to integrate them 
because doing so could eliminate redundancies and lead to a more effective 
management system.
TO EACH THEIR OWN
Risk management is a complex subject because each stakeholder places a 
different value on the probability of harm occurring and its severity. As 
one of the stakeholders, the manufacturer makes judgments relating to the 
safety and performance of a medical product, including the acceptability 
of risks. 
Traditionally, risk is assessed and managed in a variety of informal 
ways based on a compilation of observations, trends, and other information. 
That approach can provide useful information that supports the handling of Fail-Safe FMEA  255
complaints, quality defects, deviations, and resource allocation. But with a 
more formal approach, industry and regulators can assess and manage risk 
using recognized risk management tools:
• Basic risk management facilitation methods, such as flowcharts and 
check sheets
• Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)
• Fault tree analysis
• Hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP)
• Hazard operability analysis
• Preliminary hazard analysis
• Risk ranking and filtering
These tools need to be adapted for specific uses. Quality risk management 
methods and the supporting statistical tools can be used in combination. 
The combined use of these tools provides flexibility that can facilitate the 
application of quality risk management principles.
The degree of rigor and formality of quality risk management should 
reflect available knowledge and be commensurate with the complexity or 
criticality of the issue being addressed.
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH
Within pharmaceutical and medical products manufacturing, few tools 
are more useful than FMEA. In one of its guides for industry—ICH Q9: 
Quality Risk Management—FDA summarizes some of the most common 
risk management tools. Among the tools mentioned is FMEA.
FDA writes in section I.2, “FMEA provides for an evaluation of 
potential failure modes for processes and their likely effect on outcomes 
and/or product performance. Once failure modes are established, risk 
reduction can be used to eliminate, contain, reduce, or control the 
potential failures. FMEA relies on product and process understanding. 
It methodically breaks down the analysis of complex processes into 
manageable steps. It is a powerful tool for summarizing the important 
modes of failure, factors causing these failures, and the likely effects of 
these failures.”2
Furthermore, it mentions that FMEA can be used to prioritize risks 
and monitor the effectiveness of risk control activities.3
 The guide defines 
FMEA and discusses areas of application but does not provide a method 256  Appendix C
to carry out an effective FMEA. For that reason, a systematic approach 
is needed.
That approach consists of three interrelated tools: a process map, a 
cause-and-effect matrix (also called a prioritization matrix), and an FMEA. 
Instead of using the FMEA template from the beginning of the process, 
let’s analyze the failure modes for the inputs that have a larger effect on the 
critical customer requirements.
Process Map
As opposed to the commonly used flowchart, the process map is a high￾level tool that focuses on process steps, as well as their inputs and outputs. 
One of the main uses of the process map is to identify process inputs that 
cause high variability. 
The process map usually consists of six to 10 boxes that represent 
major steps in the process. For each step, the inputs and outputs are 
identified. Figure C.1 shows an example of a partial process map for a 
tablet packaging facility.

Cause-and-Effect Matrix
After the process map is developed, the prioritization process begins. Many 
companies start to fill in the FMEA template at this stage. That isn’t a good 
practice because in many processes the most critical steps are located near 
the middle or toward the end of the process.Fail-Safe FMEA  257
Those who use the beginning-to-end approach are likely to be exhausted 
by the time they start to analyze the critical steps. For that reason, it makes 
sense to add this intermediate tool.
A cause-and-effect matrix—not to be confused with the cause-and-effect 
diagram or fishbone—is used to analyze how a process input affects process 
outputs. To develop a cause-and-effect matrix, follow these six steps:
1. Identify the customer requirements and write them in the upper 
columns.
2. Assign a rating on a scale with 1 being the least important and 10 
the most important. These ratings are assigned from the customer’s 
perspective.
3. Using the process map, list the process steps and process inputs in 
each row.
4. For each process input, analyze how it affects each customer 
requirement using the following scale:
• 0 = The input does not affect the customer requirement.
• 1 = The input has a hardly noticeable effect on the customer 
requirement.
• 3 = The input has a medium effect on the customer requirement.
• 9 = The input has a strong and direct effect on the customer 
requirement.
5. Cross-multiply the ratings from steps two and four. For each row, 
multiply the value of the process input and its corresponding 
customer requirement. Add those cross-products at the end of each 
row.
6. Sort the values from step five in descending order.
The end product of using this tool is a list of the process inputs that have the 
biggest effect on the customer requirements. In this way, you can focus the 
development of the FMEA on those process inputs that really matter to the 
customer and leave unimportant issues for later analysis.
Eventually, you should analyze all the process inputs and how they could 
fail. But the key takeaway is knowing where to focus your efforts. Figure C.2 
shows an example of the tablet packaging cause-and-effect matrix already 
sorted in descending order.258  Appendix C

FMEA
After completing the cause-and-effect matrix, you can start to fill in the 
FMEA template. Instead of the beginning-to-end approach, analyze 
the failure modes of the inputs that are strongly related to customer 
requirements.
Using the cause-and-effect matrix, select the process step or input. 
For that process step or input, consider the possible ways it could fail (the 
failure mode). Then, for each failure mode, determine the result if it fails 
(the effect).
After identifying the effects, make a quantitative assessment of the 
severity. Typical scales range from 1 (no severity) to 10 (critical to human 
safety). After the severity rating is assigned, identify the potential causes 
of the failure mode. In this stage, don’t think about causal factors or the 
immediate causes. Instead, focus on potential root causes.
These are labeled as potential causes because causes have not come 
into play yet. This is one misconception about an FMEA. It’s defined as a 
proactive tool to identify and prevent the way in which a process, product, 
or system could fail. But in most cases, FMEAs are used after the failure 
has occurred. That issue will be addressed later.
After you identify the potential root causes, rate the probability of 
occurrence on a scale from 1 (low probability of occurrence) to 10 (high 
probability of occurrence). Then determine the current controls used 
to detect causes or failures and rate their effectiveness on a scale from 1 
(controls are 100 percent effective) to 10 (controls are not effective).
At this point, you can calculate the risk priority number (RPN) by 
multiplying the severity, occurrence, and detectability indices. But that’s 
not the end of the FMEA process. The next step is to sort the table in 
descending order of RPNs. In that way, the inputs with higher RPNs (most 
critical to the customer) will be located at the top of the table, while those 
with lower RPNs (least critical to the customer) will be toward the bottom 
of the table.
Not sorting RPNs from highest to lowest is another error many 
organizations make. This is the essence of the FMEA—to prioritize efforts 
to prevent the most critical inputs to failure. It does not mean you won’t 
manage the least critical inputs; it’s a matter of prioritizing.
This is aligned with what FDA expects: that an organization’s actions 
are commensurate with the risk to and impact on patient safety.
After calculating and sorting the RPNs, the real work begins. At this 
stage, it’s possible to identify and implement actions to reduce the RPN. 
After those actions are implemented, the new RPN must be calculated. This 
is the fundamental nature of the FMEA process—continuous improvement.

MAKING THE LINK
At this point, you can integrate the FMEA process with one of the systems 
used most frequently by an FDA-regulated industry: the corrective action 
and preventive action (CAPA) system.
Many organizations devote valuable resources to a proactive FMEA. 
Others focus on the CAPA system to manage the failures within their 
processes. A select few get the maximum benefit of combining both.
The true preventive actions—actions implemented to eliminate the 
root causes of nonconformances before they occur—can be easily iden￾tified via an effective FMEA initiative. That means you can identify the 
potential failure modes and their root causes, and then implement the 
actions required to prevent the occurrence of those causes. 
But, in an imperfect world, failures occur. When that happens, an 
organization immediately activates its CAPA system to initiate an inves￾tigation geared to finding the root causes and implementing the appro￾priate CAPAs.4
 In the vast majority of situations, those systems work 
independently. But do they need to?
True preventive actions can be identified using the FMEA tool. Then, 
those actions are incorporated into the preventive action portion of the 
CAPA system. When a failure does occur, the CAPA system is activated. 
But because potential failure modes and their causes are part of the 
FMEA initiative, a disconnect exists. For that reason, the CAPA system 
should provide feedback to the FMEA tool to revise and update the FMEA 
accordingly. 
FMEA GONE WRONG
Often, organizations face situations in which FDA alerts them of the wrong 
use of some tools. Here are excerpts from two warning letters issued by 
FDA regarding the incorrect application of the FMEA tool during the 
past decade:
1. Lack of integration of the FMEA process with a performance test. 
An organization received customer complaints about its tubing, which 
was assembled incorrectly. As part of the investigation, the organization 
conducted a performance test, the result of which showed that the incorrect 
assembly did not affect the product. 
But the organization did not update its FMEA, which stated that the 
incorrect assembly compromised the functionality of the device.5
 As a 
result, it left itself vulnerable to future occurrences of the same issue.262  Appendix C
2. Lack of definition of the FMEA indexes for severity, occurrence, 
and detectability. An organization received customer complaints about 
device failures, so it rushed to develop a reactive FMEA based solely on 
the major cause of complaints: contamination.
When it developed the scales to rank severity, occurrence, and detect￾ability, it did not provide a rationale for each scale. The organization only 
provided the indexes and the calculated RPN.6
These two examples show how the use of FMEA alone isn’t enough to 
guarantee product quality. While FMEA is a proactive tool within an 
organization’s risk management system, it is a dynamic component that 
must be handled correctly using the following tips:
• Perform an FMEA using a teamwork approach.
• Use a systematic method to complete the FMEA with help from a 
process map and cause-and-effect matrix.
• Prioritize the order in which the process inputs will be evaluated 
using the FMEA tool.
• Sort RPNs in descending order.
• Identify all potential root causes. 
• Identify and implement CAPAs for each root cause.
• Recalculate RPNs after CAPAs are implemented, not before.
Doing so will ensure that your FMEA is as effective as possible and your 
products are safe in the hands of the people they’re meant to help.

Quality Risk Management
Procedure Model
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
1.1 The purpose of this procedure is to define the system for the evalua￾tion of possible risks that may exist at all levels of the organization 
and facilitate compliance with GMP standards or other quality, 
safety, and environmental requirements. 
1.2 The risk analysis is applied to the development, manufacture, and 
distribution of the medicinal products that are obtained in ABC 
Corporation, through their life cycles. The aspects to consider in the 
risk analysis are the facilities, systems, equipment, or processes of 
ABC Corporation.
DEFINITIONS
2.1 Cause: A defect that is the underlying reason for the failure or that 
triggers a process that leads to failure.
2.2 Cause-and-Effects Matrix (CEM): A work tool used to prioritize 
system inputs to be evaluated in failure mode and effects analysis.
2.3 Client: Internal or external department, people, and/or processes 
that will be negatively affected by the failure mode. Some examples 
of clients are: the following operation, the subsequent operations, the 
end user, etc.
2.4 Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA): An FMEA identifies 
potential failure modes, determines their possible causes, analyzes 
associated risks, presents current controls and generates a record of 
corrective actions.
263264  Appendix D
2.5 Current Controls: A mechanism that prevents the cause of the fail￾ure mode from occurring or that detects the failure before it reaches 
the customer.
2.6 Detectability (D): The probability that the potential failure mode or 
its cause can be identified before it reaches the customer.
2.7 Effect: An adverse consequence of the failure mode that affects the 
customer.
2.8 Failure Mode: Any way in which a product or process could fail to 
fulfill its function. A failure mode can be real or potential.
2.9 Harm: Damage to health, including damage that may result from 
the loss of quality of a product or its availability.
2.10 Hazard: It is a potential source of harm.
2.11 Occurrence (O): Probability that a potential cause will happen 
during the expected life and the use of the product.

of a product (medicines) throughout its life cycle.
2.13 Risk: The combination of the probability that a harm will happen 
and its severity.
2.14 Risk Acceptance: The decision to accept the risk.
2.15 Risk Analysis: The estimate of the risk associated with an 
identified problem. It is the process of qualitative or quantitative 
analysis in which the union between the probability of occurrence 
and the severity of the damage is estimated. The ability to detect 
potential damage is a factor that is also used.
2.16 Risk Assessment: The systematic process of organization of infor￾mation that supports decision-making during a process of risk 
management for quality. It consists in the identification of hazards 
and in the analysis and evaluation of the risks associated with 
exposure to 
such hazards.

4.1.2 Quality risk management will include systematic processes 
designed to coordinate, facilitate, and improve decision-making 
based on scientific knowledge, with respect to risk. 
4.1.3 All risk management will begin with a risk management charter. 
The charter will include, as a minimum, the following elements:
 4.1.3.1 Business case 
 4.1.3.2 Problem satement 
 4.1.3.3 Goal statement 
 4.1.3.4 Project scope
 4.1.3.5 Project plan 
 4.1.3.6 Team
4.1.4 An example of the template for the project charter is presented 
in Annex 1.
4.2 Risk Assessment
4.2.1 Risk Identification
 4.2.1.1 The available information on the system or process 
to be analyzed will be compiled, so it is defined as 
clearly as possible.
 4.2.1.2 In general terms, the amount and type of information 
will depend on whether the objective of the risk 
analysis is on the design or on a machine, process, 
or system.
 4.2.1.3 In the case of process risk analysis, a process map will 
be established to facilitate its study. 
 4.2.1.4 A process map is a visual representation of a system 
in which the main parts or functions are represented 
by consecutive blocks showing their relationship. The 
process map is normally used to identify all the inputs 
of each process, as well as the product of each step of 
the process.
 4.2.1.5 The FMEA team must observe the process and/
or equipment while it is in operation to capture the 
state of the system “as is.” It is highly recommended 
to observe the operation of the system in different 
conditions, which can be: different shifts, different 
operators, different products, higher or lower speed of 
the equipment, etc.268  Appendix D
 4.2.1.6 Write down the steps as they are carried out. The 
process can be recorded on video, if this is allowed, 
to facilitate the identification and evaluation of each 
step in the process.
 4.2.1.7 Develop a process map to visually show the process 
flow and auxiliary activities (e.g., periodic feed 
materials, etc.) in a sequential manner.
 4.2.1.8 Review the diagram to ensure that all steps of the 
process are considered.
 4.2.1.9 Identify the inputs of each step. An input is what is 
fed in the step. The inputs can be materials, machin￾ery, methods, measuring equipment, personnel and 
work environment, among others. 
 4.2.1.10 An example of the template for the process map is 
presented in Annex 2.
 4.2.1.11 Once the process map has been completed, proceed
to identify which of those process inputs are those 
that most relate to the problem statement established 
in the project charter.
 4.2.1.12 A cause-and-effect matrix (CEM) is used to 
identify the key process inputs that have the 
most relationship to the critical-to-quality output 
variables. This tool offers the initial information 
for the FMEA. This matrix gives priority to the key 
inputs that will be analyzed in the FMEA.
 4.2.1.13 An example of the template for the CEM is 
presented in Annex 3 to be used as a working tool 
each time an AMFE is generated.
 4.2.1.14 Start the MCE by writing the critical-to-quality 
variables (requirement outputs) in the upper cells of 
each column, as shown in Figure D.2.
 4.2.1.15 Assign a rating to each critical-to-quality output 
variable, based on its importance. The rating 
process must be carried out by the FMEA team to 
guarantee a balanced evaluation. Use a scale of 1 
to 10, where 1 represents no importance and 10 the 
most important.

 4.2.1.19 The total value per row represents the total 
relationship of each input with respect to the 
critical-to-quality output variables. Once all the 
input-output relationships have been calculated, the 
total values must be ordered in descending order. 
The rows with the highest total values are those 
inputs of the process that have the highest relation 
to the critical-to-quality output variables.
 4.2.1.20 The following scale will be used to determine the 
relationships between the inputs and critical-to￾quality output variables:
 • For weighted scores that have at least one rating 
of 9, a red classification is assigned. 
 • For weighted scores with no rating of 9 but at 
least one rating of 3, a yellow classification 
is assigned. 
 • For weighted scores with no ratings of 9 or 3, 
but at least one rating of 1, a green classification 
is assigned.
 • For weighted scores with all ratings of zero, a 
white classification is assigned.
4.2.2 Risk Analysis
 4.2.2.1 The development of the FMEA must be carried out 
by the selected team to ensure that all aspects are 
taken into consideration and that the risk rating is 
not biased. An isolated FMEA will not generate an 
effective analysis.
 4.2.2.2 The initial inputs for the FMEA are those identified 
in the CEM that have the strongest relationship 
with the critical-to-quality output variables. These 
are the first elements that are listed in the FMEA 
format (Annex 4), those with a strong and direct 
relationship. As mentioned, these are the inputs that 
have weighted scores with at least one rating of 9.
 4.2.2.3 The FMEA team must evaluate each step/input of 
the system and identify all associated failure modes. 
A failure mode is a statement of what can go wrong 
in that particular step and input, that is, ways in 
which a system can fail potentially to perform its 
function or the intention of the design. Faults can be 272  Appendix D
partial, intermittent, or unintentional, for example, 
and can affect quality, reliability, performance, 
or safety. 
 4.2.2.4 The result of a failure mode that is not corrected, 
detected, or removed is its effect. The effect of a 
failure mode is the impact it will have on the client 
(requirements/outputs) and describes in terms of the 
client’s perception. It can be an immediate effect 
in the subsequent stage or beyond in the life of the 
product. 
 4.2.2.5 The severity of each effect is the seriousness of this 
effect for the client. This is a relationship with an 
ordinary value in relation to the harm that may be 
caused by the effect of the patient’s risk, the regu￾latory impact, and/or the impact of the process. 
Annex 5 shows the severity rating in the FMEA.
 4.2.2.6 Identify the potential causes that could lead to 
the failure mode under study. A failure mode can 
have more than one cause; however, the analysis 
focuses on possible root causes based on exhaustive 
assessments rather than on the causal factors or 
immediate causes. 
 4.2.2.7 A cause-and-effect diagram (fishbone diagram) and 
a fault tree analysis are useful tools that can be used 
to identify potential causes. “Incorrect material” or 
“Lack of a standard operating procedure” are exam￾ples of potential causes.
 4.2.2.8 The causes are classified according to their proba￾bility of occurrence. The probability of a failure that 
occurs during the operation of an identified cause is 
indicated by an ordinal value scale that ranges from 
1 (will never happen) to 5 (will always happen). 
Annex 6 shows the occurrence rating in the FMEA.
 NOTE: The probability of occurrence is not based 
on the actual number of occurrences the failure 
has happened, but on the potential that the failure 
occurs every time a task is performed.
 4.2.2.9 The column of controls in the FMEA is filled by a 
list of current methods that prevent a failure mode Quality Risk Management Procedure Model  273
from occurring (proactive) and those that detect the 
failure mode if it occurs (reactive). 
 4.2.2.10 Conduct an assessment of the likelihood that the 
current controls will detect the cause or failure 
mode before the product leaves the current process 
stage, the installation, or before its delivery to the 
client.
 4.2.2.11 The rating of the efficacy of the controls is 
established by the detection value. This value 
represents the capacity to identify the presence of 
a failure mode at the earliest possible point in the 
process. 
 4.2.2.12 An easily detected failure mode, given the current 
controls, is assigned a low value, while a high value 
indicates that the detection of a failure mode is very 
unlikely. Annex 7 shows the detection rating in the 
FMEA.
 4.2.2.13 The priority risk number (RPN) can be calculated 
once the severity, occurrence, and detection have 
been determined. The RPN is the measure of the 
risk of failure and is used to prioritize corrective/
preventive actions. Mathematically, the RPN is the 
product of severity, occurrence, and detection.
 RPN = Severity x Occurrence x Detection
4.2.3 Risk Evaluation
 4.2.3.1 Classify the failure modes (rows) in descending 
order by the RPN so the rows with the highest RPN 
(which represents the highest risk to the client) are 
at the top of the analysis.
 4.2.3.2 The following scale will be used to determine the 
risk of each of the failure modes:
 • 60-125 – High risk
 • 27-59 – Moderate risk
 • 1-26 – Low risk
 NOTE: Regardless of the RPN value, any case with 
a Severity Index 5 will be considered high risk. In 
this case, further controls to avoid the failure mode 
will be analyzed.274  Appendix D
 4.2.3.2 Once the most significant risks have been identified 
using the RPN, then actions to reduce severity, 
occurrence, and/or detection ratings can be 
recommended. 
 4.2.3.3 In general, the severity of a failure mode can only 
be reduced by design changes. 
 4.2.3.4 The occurrence can be reduced by eliminating 
or controlling the causes within the process. 
Automated systems that prevent failure from 
occurring are a common approach to this 
classification. 
 4.2.3.5 Detecting a failure mode is usually the first way 
to respond to reduce the RPN. Improving existing 
control methods or implementing new ones, such as 
automated inspection systems and online tests, are 
actions that allow the failure mode to be detected 
before it reaches the client.
 4.2.3.6 Assign a responsible person for each recommended 
action based on the nature of the task.
 4.2.3.7 Once the actions are implemented in response to 
the failure modes, recalculate the RPN taking into 
account the changes and sort again in descending 
order.
 4.2.3.8 The revision of the FMEA is done either because of 
the changes implemented that impacted the system 
or at least on an annual basis. The revision and 
creation of FMEA documents must be managed by 
the applicable change control procedures.
 4.2.3.9 The FMEA must be updated each time a new 
failure mode, cause, and/or effect is identified. The 
identification may be the result of a validation/
qualification, case of noncompliance, product/
process changes, complaints, or as part of a CAPA 
activity.
4.3 Risk Control
4.3.1 Risk Reduction
 4.3.1.1 Risk reduction is based on processes that mitigate 
or avoid a quality risk when it exceeds a specific 
(acceptable) level (see Figure D.1). Quality Risk Management Procedure Model  275
 4.3.1.2 The risk reduction can include actions that mitigate 
the severity and probability of the harm. Processes 
that improve the ability to detect hazards and the 
risks to quality can also be used as part of the risk 
control strategy. 
 4.3.1.3 The implementation of measures to reduce risks 
can introduce new risks into the system or increase 
the importance of other existing risks. Hence, it 
is appropriate to return to the risk assessment to 
identify and assess any possible change in risk once 
the process of reducing it has been implemented.
4.3.2 Risk Acceptance
 4.3.2.1 The acceptance of the risk is the decision to assume 
the risk. 
 4.3.2.2 The acceptance of the risk may be a formal decision 
in which the residual risk is assumed, or it may be 
a passive decision in which residual risks are not 
specified. 
 4.3.2.3 In some cases, even the best risk management 
process for quality could not completely eliminate 
the risk. In these cases, it could be accepted that an 
adequate strategy has been applied to manage the 
quality risk and that the risk has been reduced to a 
specific (acceptable) level. 
 4.3.2.4 This level will depend on different parameters and 
should be determined on a case-by-case basis.
4.4 Risk Communication
4.4.1 Risk communication involves the exchange of information 
about risk and its management among decision-makers and 
other parties. 
4.4.2 Communication can be done at any point in the risk 
management process. The results of this process must be 
communicated and documented in the appropriate form. 
4.4.3 Communications can be made between different stakeholders, 
for example, regulators and industry, industry and patients, 
people within a company, industry and regulatory 
authority, etc. 276  Appendix D
4.4.4 The information that is transmitted may be the existence, 
nature, form, probability, severity, degree of acceptance, 
control, treatment, detection capacity, or other aspects related 
to quality risks.
4.4.5 The communication does not have to be done for each and 
every one of the acceptances of a risk. 
4.4.6 The communication between the industry and the regulatory 
authorities on the risk management decisions for quality could 
be made through the channels specified in the regulations and 
guidelines.
4.5 Risk Review
4.5.1 Risk management must be something continuous in the 
process of quality management. 
4.5.2 A mechanism to review and control events must be 
implemented.
4.5.3 The results of the risk management process should be 
reviewed taking into account new knowledge and experience. 
4.5.4 Once a risk management process for quality has been 
initiated, it should continue to be used on events that could 
have an impact on the original decision adopted, whether 
these events were planned (for example, results after the 
review of products, inspections, audits, exchange control, 
etc.) or not (for example, withdrawals, causes found after the 
investigations of failures, etc.) 
4.5.5 The frequency of the review will depend on the level of risk. 
4.5.6 The risk review could include a reconsideration of the 
decisions taken to accept the risk.
4.5.7 It must be kept in mind that the introduction of actions is a 
possible source of new dangers, so it will be necessary to 
follow up in order to identify and control them.
4.5.8 The frequency of review will depend on the level of risk and 
will be established on a case-by-case basis.Quality Risk Management Procedure Model  277
5. DOCUMENTS
In each risk analysis, the following must be documented:
• Risk management charter
• Process map
• Cause-and-effects matrix
• Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)
• Corrective and/or preventive actions from the FMEA
Code:
Each document will have an assigned code:
RA-ZZZZZZZZ-MMYYYY
whereas:
RA means risk analysis
ZZZZZZZZ are letters or numbers that identify the system or 
process to be evaluated (maximum eight letters).
MMYYYY are the month (MM) and the year (YYYY) in which 
the risk assessment was developed. 
In case several risk analysis studies are carried out on the same element, 
these will be distinguished by a consecutive extra number that will be 
added to the end of the code after a point (starting with 1). In this way, it 
is understood that the initial report is zero (even if it does not appear in 
the code).278  Appendix D Risk management title: Date (last revision): Prepared by: Approved by: Business Case: Problem Statement:

Rating Severity
5
Critical—The performance and safety of the product are 
severely affected, and the client is very dissatisfied. It 
endangers the machinery or the operator. The product is 
not functional. It leads to noncompliance of a regulation 
and/or safety specifications, as well as product recall, 
consequences to health, or death. Causes injury to a patient 
or another person.
4
Major—Product performance is affected to a large extent, 
and the client is very dissatisfied. It can cause serious 
disruption to subsequent operations or require further 
rework. The product may become inoperable, but it remains 
safe. Field alert or several affected lots.
3
Moderate—The product has a minor violation and is not 
subject to legal actions of regulatory agency. There is 
a moderate effect on product performance. The client 
experiences some dissatisfaction. It may cause rework, 
repair, or damage to the equipment. The product is operable 
but is something that can result in a customer complaint.
2
Minor—There is a slight effect on product performance. The 
client may be a little annoyed. It may cause slight discomfort 
with subsequent operations. Failure does not require product 
rework or repair; rather, it is a small annoyance that does not 
cause loss.
1
No Severity—There is no effect or very little effect, that is, no 
consequences, adequate product in adequate quantity in the 
correct container, correctly labeled. The process is in control. 
The client probably will not even notice the effect of this 
failure mode on the product. It is not perceived and does not 
affect performance.
Annex 5 Severity ratings for FMEA.Quality Risk Management Procedure Model  283
Rating Occurrence
5
Always—The failure is almost sure to happen. The failure can 
occur more than once a day and is almost certain to occur 
more than once per batch.
4
Frequently—The failure will occur in most circumstances. 
The failure can occur once a week, once per month, or once 
per batch.
3
Moderately—The failure could happen at any time. There is 
a moderate chance the cause will occur at least once every 
three to six months.
2
Rarely—The failure is not likely to occur. There is a remote 
likelihood that the cause will occur at least once every one to 
three years.
1
Never—The failure is extremely unlikely or can never occur. 
There is a very remote likelihood the cause will occur at least 
once in more than five years.
Annex 6 Occurrence ratings for FMEA.284  Appendix D
Rating Occurrence
5
Never—There are no current controls; they are unreliable or not 
tested in the detection of this potential cause or failure mode. 
There is very high probability that the failure will not be detected 
in time to avoid the effect. The ruling is latent, it is not verified 
at present, or it is not verifiable. It is not detectable by current 
methods. The current control is not able to prevent or detect the 
failure mode.
4
Rarely—It is very likely that the failure will not be detected in 
the process. All inspection is manual. The action is performed, 
but there is no standard operating procedure defining how it is 
performed.
3
Frequently—The failure may not be detected in the process. 
Standard operating procedure exists and is done and registered, 
but details of the standard operating procedure are missing. 
Standard operating procedure needs improvement.
2
Almost Always—It is very likely that the fault will be detected 
by the control in the process. There is a standard operating 
procedure, and the action is performed and recorded. Standard 
operating procedure does not need any improvement.
1
Always—The control will detect or prevent failure in almost all 
cases in the process. Failure is obvious or 100 percent detected. 
Control is 100 percent automated.
