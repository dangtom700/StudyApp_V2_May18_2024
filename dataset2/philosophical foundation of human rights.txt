The second edition of this textbook takes into account the human rights issues and 
problems that have arisen as a result of the global Corona epidemic as well as 
important developments in human rights jurisprudence (climate protection judge￾ment of the German Federal Constitutional Court of 2021, abortion judgement of 
the US Supreme Court of 2022). Numerous inaccuracies of the frst edition have 
been corrected and important passages have been made clearer and easier to under￾stand. I thank the reviewers of the frst edition for important comments that I was 
able to take into account in the second edition. My special thanks go to Felix van 
Groningen, who checked the complete book once again with regard to correct 
expression as well as grammatical and orthographical correctness.

VPreface
This textbook presents a series of lectures, which I held between 2016 and 2020 
during the winter semester at the Justus Liebig University in Giessen. It was aimed 
primarily at German law students who have to pass a course in a foreign language 
in preparation for the exam. The lecture was also always very well attended by 
Erasmus and other exchange students from all over the world. Most of the partici￾pants were already advanced in their law studies. Nevertheless, philosophical think￾ing was still completely new and foreign to them. The textbook is therefore 
particularly suitable for advanced law students, who are at the same time beginners 
in the feld of philosophy. The style of an oral lecture was largely retained.
The textbook presents the classical approaches of legal and social philosophy in 
order to show that they are unsuitable as a foundation of human rights. Only the 
conception of human dignity provides a suffcient basis if it is developed out of the 
Kantian distinction of price and dignity. Deriving human rights from the principle 
of human dignity makes it possible to identify the crucial characteristic of human 
rights, namely the protection of personhood. This makes it possible (1) to distin￾guish real moral human rights from spurious ones, (2) to analyze the protection 
scope of codifed human rights according to the criteria of “core” and “yard,” and 
(3) to have a starting point for the discovery of new, unwritten human rights. This 
philosophical basis makes a substantial criticism of the case-law on human rights 
possible and allows a substantial contribution to its improvement with regard to 
legal certainty, clarity, and cogency.
The textbook is primarily addressed to advanced law students who are inter￾ested in a deeper understanding of human rights. But the textbook is also suitable 
for students of humanities who want to delve into human rights as well as for any￾one in the political or social arena who refers to human rights or fghts for the 
enforcement of human rights.
It is not the aim of this textbook to deal with the entire stock of the interna￾tional human rights law. Some relevant human rights are not mentioned (e.g., the 
ban of slavery or the right to use one’s own mother tongue or the specifc rights of 
children). Those who study this textbook with suffcient attention, however, should 
be able to deal with all these real, or alleged, human rights from a solid foundation. 
The manuscript was completed before the coronavirus pandemic blocked almost 
all public life worldwide, including severe restrictions on freedoms in the area of 
some important human rights. It was therefore not possible to discuss the very 
specifc human rights issues in this unique situation. However, readers of this book 
should be able to properly discuss and resolve these issues.
I am full of gratefulness toward Arman Nikkhoo JD, Washington, and Lee 
University School of Law, Lexington, VA, who corrected the text of the book in 
terms of grammar, orthography, and style. All remaining insuffciencies are on my 
own account. I also thank Sophie Reinisch for her great support. She drew some very important graphics and she did so very carefully, reliably, and in short time. 
Finally, I thank the Springer Editor Anke Seyfried and Senior Editorial Assistant 
Manuela Schwietzer for the proven and professional support of the project.

Hermeneutic Circle
Hermeneutics is the methodology of interpreting mean￾ingful human action as well as the products of such 
actions, most importantly in texts (Greek: herme￾neia  =  interpretation). The Hermeneutic Circle refers 
to the fact that any interpretation is based on, and must 
start from, a certain pre-understanding of the text. This 
pre-understanding is based on the context in which the 
text concerned is integrated. The circle results from the 
fact that one must already know about the meaning of 
the text in order to be able to get further knowledge 
about the meaning of the text.
In the frst lesson, the term “human rights” is inter￾preted in the context of the preamble and Article 1 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) 
in order to receive an initial pre-understanding.
Rights
A right is a non-violent source of power over fellow 
humans which makes the holder of the right able to 
steer the behavior of others for the sake of his own pro￾tected interests. This ability is caused by normative 
acceptance. Normative acceptance is based on the 
belief that the subjects of the right are to be norma￾tively bound (=obliged). So, a right consists of the fol￾lowing 3 elements:
1. Protection Scope (reference to the content of the 
right)
2. Commandment (reference to the holder—obligee)
3. Belief to be bound (reference to the addressee—obli￾gor)
The idea of subjective rights was developed in the 
Middle Ages by analyzing the meaning of the term 
“property.”
2 Chapter 1 · Introduction1
Human Rights
The term human rights refers to subjective rights that 
manifest the following properties (see preamble and 
Article 1 of the UDHR):
5 Generality and Individuality
– “All members of the human family” are 
holders of human rights.
5 Unavailability (not created but found)
– Human beings are “born in rights.”
– Human rights are a matter of “recognition.”
5 Absoluteness
– Human rights are “inalienable.”
5 Morality
– Human rights are a matter of the “con￾science of mankind.”
5 Universality
– Human rights are a matter of a “common 
faith of all peoples of the United Nations.”
5 Super-Positivity
– Human rights should be “protected by law.”
Philosophy
Currently, there are two different understandings of 
philosophy:
5 Analytic Philosophy: The analysis of (basic) con￾cepts in order to improve our understanding of our 
own language and thoughts.
5 Naturalistic Philosophy: Natural science without 
empirical means.
Methods of Analytic Philosophy
Revisionist explication of concepts (sharpening):
5 Adequateness (connectability with ordinary lan￾guage use)
5 Empirical Signifcance
5 Metaphysical Parsimony
5 Distinctness
Descriptive Explication:
5 Transcendental Analysis (investigating the condi￾tions of possibility)
5 Thought Experiments (testing the range and the con￾sequences of certain interpretations of concepts).

Introduction1
The Reasons in Favor of a Philosophical Foundation 
of Human Rights
1. Appropriate interpretation of the scope of protec￾tion of the codifed rights.
2. Appropriate interpretation of the limits of restric￾tion of the codifed rights.
3. Discovery of new (unwritten) human rights.
4. Distinction between genuine and merely alleged 
human rights.
1.1 The Aims of the Lecture
This lecture does not address human rights in the way that 
is typical of the framework of legal education. Legal edu￾cation normally consists of an introduction to legal texts 
that address human rights. Such legal texts tend to be the 
chapters concerning fundamental rights in national con￾stitutions or international treaties or covenants specifcally 
dealing with human rights. The student should not only 
know the content of these texts, but also how to apply 
them. For that purpose, students must study the case law 
of the highest national courts related to human rights and 
the case law of the international human rights courts and 
similarly oriented judicial bodies. We can call this approach 
the legal doctrine approach.Start.
Another approach to human rights is the historical 
one. Under this approach, students study the historical 
development of human rights from their beginning up 
through their recent developments. The historical 
approach sometimes starts with the Cyrus-Cylinder, a law 
of the Persian king Cyrus from the year 538 BC. Others 
start with a famous letter written by the Christian lawyer 
Quintus Septimus Tertullianus Florens (160–220), in 
which he coined the expression “ius humanus”—human 
right (Ad Scapulam). A third group of historical stories 
starts with the English Magna Carta Libertatum of 1215. 
Most historical presentations, however, start with the 
Virginia Bill of Rights of 1776.
In this course, we will neither follow the legal doctrine 
approach nor the historical approach—although it will 
sometimes be necessary to illustrate our results with refer￾ences to doctrine and history. We will follow the philo￾sophical approach. This is a distinct approach, but it is 
also closely connected to the doctrinal approach and the 
Legal Doctrine 
Approach

Approach

historical approach. Only philosophical analysis makes 
clear what has really occurred throughout history. 
Contemporary agents within the historical play very rarely 
have a suffcient awareness of what they are doing and 
thinking. Only through philosophical refection of what 
happened in history can one begin to explain and reveal 
the real signifcance and consequences of ideas developed 
in the past.
Philosophical analysis is not a purely abstract and the￾oretical venture. Rather, it supports the rationality of case 
law and doctrine. By uncovering the meaning, signifcance, 
and logical consequences of human rights, philosophical 
analysis can contribute to the improvement of case law 
and legislation. Skillful philosophical analysis of human 
rights enables lawyers to develop an independent critical 
view on case law and makes them capable of fnding a con￾vincing argumentation in matters of human rights that 
may support the interest of their clients and the develop￾ment of rational human rights case law.
Before we can start with the philosophical analysis, we 
have frst to clarify the basic concepts. A lecture on the 
philosophy of human rights can only start if we have suf￾fcient clearness on the two key concepts:
5 What are we referring to when we talk about human 
rights and what is meant by “human rights” in the con￾text of this lecture?
5 What do we actually mean when we speak of a philo￾sophical analysis? What is meant by philosophy?
1.2 The Concept of Human Rights
The frst question may appear confusing to you. The clari￾fcation of what human rights really are is the aim that we 
want to follow by means of philosophical analyses. 
Therefore, it seems to be true that this question can only 
be answered at the end of the lecture and not before we 
start.
It is not possible, however, to begin our investigation if 
we do not have any idea of the concept that we want to 
analyze. What we intuitively know about the idea may be 
nebulous. But without this initial understanding, we can￾not begin to say what we are wrestling with.
This situation—already knowing something about a 
certain idea before you can start to collect knowledge 
Hermeneutic Circle

1.2 · The Concept of Human Rights1
. Fig. 1.1 Hermeneutic circle
about the exact meaning of that idea—is called the herme￾neutical circle (see . Fig. 1.1). We must always start with 
a certain preconception of what we want to discover (= n). 
Philosophical work, then, consists in the development of a 
more sophisticated version of this preconception (=n + 1). 
This new version becomes the preconception of any fur￾ther analysis (n + 1 = n) and so on. The process only comes 
to an end if the capacity of our fantasy is exhausted and if 
we reach the feeling that everything that may possibly be 
said about the concept has been said. Nevertheless, this is 
only a temporary end of the analyses. We can never be 
truly sure whether the extent of our fantasy may expand in 
the future and give rise to new questions that may coerce 
us into continuing the philosophical analyses.
So, we frst have to determine our provisional under￾standing of the concept of human rights that should serve 
as the starting point of our refections.
I start with the element “right” in the concept “human 
right.” What is meant by “right”? “Right” is meant as a 
subjective right. The concept of subjective rights was 
developed slowly in the Middle Ages in the context of dis￾cussions about property. Until then, subjective rights were 
rather alien to traditional legal thinking. The law con￾sisted only of obligations. There were, so to say, only obli￾gors but no obligees. Legal obligations were considered 
Right
6 Chapter 1 · Introduction1
obligations toward the legislator. If someone did not ful￾fll his obligations, he was threatened with public punish￾ment, which had no direct effect toward those who were 
harmed.
The Roman private law recognized the procedural 
right to take legal action against someone who hurt the 
property of another. But the Roman jurists had no clear 
awareness of the fact that the right to take legal action 
depends logically on having a material right to property. 
Only in the Middle Ages did it become more and more 
clear that property was not a relationship between human 
beings and things, but rather a relationship among human 
beings, more specifcally between an obligor and one or 
more obligees, and thus a material right to which a claim￾ant of legal action may refer. In contrast to liabilities, 
which are based on individual contracts, the obligations 
owed to the owner of property were considered the obliga￾tions of everyone, independent of any individual contrac￾tual relationship with the obligee.
A deeper refection about the question what property 
actually is led to the result that owners of property are 
considered as having a certain kind of power over others, 
according to which they could force these others to respect 
a certain sphere of belongings or activities of the owner. 
This was the introduction of the idea of subjective rights.
Subjective rights can be understood as a source of 
power of an obligee over one or more obligors. It is the 
right holder’s power to steer the behavior of others for the 
sake of his own interests. Subjective rights only exist where 
fellow humans accept the power of the right holder by rec￾ognizing themselves as obligors toward an obligee. This 
acceptance is not only a kind of understanding of factual 
inferiority, but rather a normative acceptance according to 
which the obligor feels obliged to recognize a certain 
sphere of freedom of the obligee and to follow his com￾mandments so long as these commandments relate to the 
sphere of freedom that is the subject of the right.
A subjective right, therefore, always has a certain 
structure. We can distinguish three elements:
1. A subjective right defnes a certain scope of power or 
freedom, which is the content of the right. This aspect 
of a right is called protection scope. Every single right 
refers to a specifc protection scope. The protection 
scope can refer to certain material things, like an area 
of land or particular mobile things (cars, pencils, 
clothes, etc.). If the protection scope refers to such 
Defnition
7
1.2 · The Concept of Human Rights1 material things and if the respective right demands 
respect of the exclusive power of a certain individual 
over these things, we talk about property. The protec￾tion scope can, however, refer to other spheres of exclu￾sive power, for example, the power to determine what 
someone wants to speak out loud, or the power to 
behave in a certain manner etc. In these cases, we talk 
about freedoms or privileges.
2. The second element of a right is the actual normative 
element which we call a commandment: Be respectful! 
Do not touch or infringe upon the scope of protection! 
Do not disturb me while I am behaving deliberately 
within the frame of the protection scope!
3. The third element of a right is the conviction of the 
addressees of the commandment to be normatively 
bound by that commandment. When members of a par￾ticular society collectively believe in certain obligations, 
the beliefs become a cultural reality. In such cases, well 
defned rights exist as part of the culture of the society.
The function of a philosophical foundation of human 
rights thus becomes clear. As rights are based on a com￾mon belief in binding power, it is important to question 
the basis of this belief. This basis may be formed on the 
belief that the liability of rights can be irrational or ratio￾nal. If our belief in rights is based on irrational consider￾ations, then it is possible to destroy it simply by pointing 
out the irrationality. Human beings are (ideally) rational 
living entities. They tend to be incapable of feeling bound 
to ideas which they consider irrational. The task of philo￾sophical refections is therefore to examine the idea of 
human rights in terms of a rationally based belief in them.
Now I come to the second part of the term “human 
rights”. What is meant by “human”? The idea of rights is 
a human idea. It is potentially part of human culture. In 
this sense we can say that rights are always human rights. 
Animal rights insofar as animals have their own authentic 
idea of rights do not exist.
The meaning of the concept “human” is so broad and 
so vague that it is not possible to understand the meaning 
simply by analyzing the word. We must examine the con￾text in which the word appears in order to fnd an appro￾priate pre-understanding of “human.” For that reason, we 
should look to documents that address human rights.
Human
8 Chapter 1 · Introduction1
The most fundamental document for the current con￾ception of human rights is the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights that was adopted by the UN General 
Assembly on December 10, 1948 (UDHR). The preamble 
of the UDHR provides:
» Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the 
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human
family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in 
the world,
Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights 
have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the 
conscience of mankind […]
Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled 
to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyr￾anny and oppression, that human rights should be pro￾tected by the rule of law, […]
Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in 
the Charter reaffrmed their faith in fundamental human 
rights
Article 1 further provides:
» All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights.
These quotations give a frst look of what we may come to 
understand in the word “human”:
1. All members of the human family are holders of 
human rights.
2. Human beings are born in rights.
3. Human rights are a matter of recognition.
4. Human rights are inalienable.
5. Human rights are a matter of the conscience of man￾kind.
6. Human rights are a matter of a common faith of all 
peoples of the UN.
7. Human rights should be protected by law.
The word “human” in “human rights” tells us something 
about the holder of these rights. All members of the 
human family are holders of human rights (Alexander & 
Moore, 2012). Family obviously refers to mankind as such 
while member obviously refers to each human individual. 
From this frst statement we can grasp the individuality
and generality of human rights.
Individuality and 
Generality

1.2 · The Concept of Human Rights1 Importantly, the wording in the UDHR differs from 
that of the preamble of the UN Charter of 26 June 1945. 
The Charter does not refer to the rights of each member 
of the human family, but rather to the rights of each 
human person. We should this difference keep in mind.
By which process do human individuals become hold￾ers of human rights? The preamble of the UDHR notes 
that human individuals are born in rights (Beaney, 2017). 
This expression is to be understood as a metaphor because 
rights are normative ideas. They belong to the world of 
thoughts and not to the world of natural facts. The char￾acteristics that human beings are born with are only a 
matter of natural facts and not a matter of their internal 
thinking. But what is being said with this metaphor is that 
there is no act of conferring that endows human beings 
with human rights. Human rights do not depend on some￾one arbitrarily or deliberately deciding whether to confer 
human rights upon another. Humans always have these 
rights and they have them without any involvement of any 
authority.
Therefore, ascribing human rights to human individu￾als is not a matter of willingness and decision making, but 
rather a matter of recognition (Beaney, 2017). Nobody is 
entitled to decide whether or not human rights should be 
conferred to a human individual—that is, whether or not 
a human being is to be considered a holder of human 
rights. We have only to recognize that human rights have 
already been conferred to human individuals.
What is said by inalienability (Clapham, 2015)? Because 
human rights are considered as always already being con￾ferred and therefore not based on any possible act of con￾ferring them, human rights must also be considered as 
something that cannot be revoked. Accordingly, there is 
no recognizable normative power or recognizable proce￾dures or reasons and justifcations for the deprivation of 
human rights. It is simply not possible to deprive a human 
individual of their human rights. It follows that human 
individuals cannot be partially deprived of their human 
rights by reducing the scope of human rights protections 
or by making the recognition of human rights a matter of 
balancing other interests.
Inalienability leads to the conclusion that human rights 
must be considered absolute rights. Specifcally, absolute￾ness means the following:
1. There is absolutely no situation or condition under 
which it is possible to deny the recognition of one’s

Inalienability

human rights. Criminals, prostitutes, and terrorists 
have exactly the same rights to the same extent as any￾body else. However evil or bad behavior may be, it 
never leads to the result that someone may have for￾feited their human rights.
2. The recognition of human rights can come into confict 
with the recognition of other values, rights, and tradi￾tions. But whatever the confict is, human rights always 
prevail. It is not possible to rank any human right lower 
than any other value or interest. We should keep in 
mind that this idea could lead to serious problems if it 
comes to a confict between two interests when both of 
them are protected by a human right.
The recognition of human rights is not an act of discovery 
that we express in propositional sentences of the form “It 
is the case that …”. Rather, it is a discovery of normative 
obligations. This becomes clear in the reference to con￾science (Cruft et al., 2015). Conscience stands for our con￾victions in the moral rules to which we feel bound.
The reference to the common faith of mankind (Ernst, 
2012) claims the universality of human rights. The UDHR 
claims that the faith in human rights is not only relative to 
a certain regional or religious tradition or culture. It 
claims, rather, that it is a common faith of mankind that is 
recognized and appreciated worldwide by every member 
of the human family, independent of time, region, or cul￾ture.
I think it is not diffcult to understand that this claim is 
empirically false. Throughout history and in current times, 
there have been cultures in the world that do not have an 
idea of human rights. Therefore, human rights are not a 
matter of a common faith. The proposition in the pream￾ble cannot deny this empirical fact. It can be understood, 
rather, as the expression of the belief that it is generally 
possible to convince mankind, i.e., every member of the 
human family, of the binding power of certain inalienable 
human rights.
The last relevant claim of the preamble of the UDHR 
states that human rights should be protected by law (Foot, 
1978). From this we can conclude that human rights as 
defned by the UDHR are not considered legal rights. 
Otherwise, they would be part of the law and it would not 
make any sense to say that they should be protected by 
law.

1.2 · The Concept of Human Rights1 Comparatively, it is clear that those human rights, 
which are codifed in several international covenants and 
treaties as well as in national constitutions, are of course 
legal rights. What the clause wants to say is that non-legal 
(moral) human rights should be transformed into legal 
rights in order to protect them more effciently.
The connection between legally codifed human rights 
and human rights into which human beings “are born” is 
expressed in the distinction between positive law and its 
relation to super-positive standards. Human rights must 
be considered extra-systemic sources of the legal system. 
This is what is meant when we say that human rights have 
a super-positive character.
“Positive” in this context is not the opposite of “nega￾tive.” It means, rather, that the norms of the legal order are 
put down by the legislator of that system. “Positive” is 
derived from the Latin past participle of ponere (to put)
and means “settled by agreement.” It is the traditional 
opposite of “natural.” Positive laws, as such, are created 
by men while natural laws are created by God or by nature. 
However, I do not use the word “natural” in order to talk 
about the opposite of “positive.” Instead, I use the word 
“super-positive” to indicate a kind of law that is not made 
by the sources of the legal system (legislator, parliament, 
etc.) but from something else. Furthermore, this extra￾systemic source is “super” insofar as that it has a higher 
rank than the positive law. The higher rank makes it pos￾sible for the legal system to be evaluated on such a scale.
“Super-positive,” however, does here not mean “natu￾ral.” The term leaves it intentionally open what the sources 
of super-positive law are. The term is thus not already 
fxed on God or on nature as a source of non-positive law.
Generally, when we speak of human rights as super￾positive rights, we think of rights in a moral meaning. This 
does not force us to think that the rules of morality, 
including moral rights, must be something that are not 
invented or created by men, but rather revealed by God or 
by nature. Even if we think of morality as a product of 
human culture, it is nevertheless not a product of the legal 
system. Rather, it is something created outside of law, 
based on standards and considerations that are different 
from those within the legal system.
Thus, moral rules can also be understood as positive 
(man-made) rules. But from a legal point of view, they can 
be considered as being super-positive in that they are cre￾ated beyond the boundaries of the legal system. Moral 
12 Chapter 1 · Introduction1
rules are an extra-systemic source to which the law may or 
may not refer.
The super-positive characteristic of human rights, in 
turn, provides for the most important function of these 
rights. They serve as instruments by which it is possible to 
evaluate an entire legal system. They are a means to ques￾tion its justness, corruption, or unjustness.
Indeed, the function of a legal system is to produce 
standards of justice and corruption. But as long as these 
standards are positive legal standards, they can only func￾tion to evaluate particular parts of the legal system as 
opposed to the legal system as a whole. In other words, 
you can evaluate the justice of a judicial or administrative 
decision on the standards of a communal regulation. The 
justice of the regulation can be evaluated on the standard 
of the parliamentarian statute. That statute can be evalu￾ated on the standards of the constitution. But there is no 
legal standard beyond the constitution by which the con￾stitution can be evaluated. In order to evaluate the consti￾tution of a legal system, i.e., the system as a whole, there 
must be some reference to a super-positive standard—e.g., 
a moral standard. Human rights are moral standards that 
lend themselves to the evaluation of legal systems as a 
whole.
A legal system is only legitimate if it is in line with 
human rights. This is the case if there is no principle con￾fict between any part of the legal order and human rights 
(see . Fig. 1.2).
A legal system is corrupted if important parts of the 
legal order are in confict with human rights and the legal 
system does not include any self-healing functions (see 
. Fig. 1.3).

Finally, we can call it an unjust legal order when no 
important part of it is in line with human rights, which is 
to say that the legal order is outside the frame of human 
rights (see . Fig. 1.4).
1.3 The Concept of Philosophy
So far, we have described the preconception of what we 
want to understand by human rights. You should further 
recognize that this preconception of the term “human 
rights” is not undisputed. In particular, many American 
philosophers share the opinion that human rights are only 
characterized by their specifc content. But they consider 
these rights to be pure legal rights which have nothing to 
do with morality. Additional references to this view may 
be found in the bibliography at the end of this chapter 
(Raz, 2010; Waldron, 2013).
The focus now shifts to the other concept that needs 
some refection and clarifcation. This lecture deals with a 
philosophical foundation and a philosophical analysis of 
human rights. Thus, we must clarify what should be under￾14 Chapter 1 · Introduction1
stood by “philosophy.” Today we can distinguish between 
two different conceptions of philosophy.
According to the frst and more traditional conception, 
philosophy deals with the world of facts. It is a kind of 
science that addresses everything that any other science 
may address. The only true difference to other sciences is 
that philosophy asks broader questions and comes to 
more abstract answers. Unlike the empirical sciences, how￾ever, it does not use empirical research methods. This is 
what is called the naturalistic conception of philosophy.
According to the second conception, philosophy deals 
with the meaning of concepts. Its aim is to clarify concepts 
in order to avoid confusion and to make us able to under￾stand our own thoughts. This is what we call the analytical 
conception of philosophy.
I personally do not share the naturalistic approach. I 
think that questions concerning the facts of the world are 
always empirical questions that demand empirical answers. 
It is the task of empirical sciences to deal with empirical 
questions and empirical sciences can ask these questions 
with different levels of abstractness. We do not need a 
non-empirical discipline in this feld. Non-empirical 
approaches cannot lead to any real understanding and dis￾covery of empirical reality. It might be that something 
exists beyond the empirical reality. Nevertheless, whatever 
may lie beyond our empirical world is not accessible to us 
as human beings. It is not possible to gain any knowledge 
about it. Naturalistic philosophy therefore tends to replace 
knowledge with simple speculation and a play of imagina￾tion. Although that often sounds very interesting, it is in 
fact an aspect of science fction rather than a component 
of a serious, rational approach. Therefore, I follow the 
analytic conception of philosophy. The clarifcation of 
concepts can give us a clearer understanding of our own 
thoughts and aims.
The clarifcation of concepts is done by explication. We 
distinguish between two different sorts of explication—
the descriptive and the revisionist explication.
The revisionist explication deals with the concepts of 
ordinary language that are much too vague for the pur￾poses of science, law, and ethics. The vagueness is mostly 
the result of a more or less intuitive development of the 
meaning of concepts. The concept of human rights is an 
excellent example of a concept to which meaning may be 
intuitively associated. The task of analytic philosophy is 
Naturalistic

Revisionist Explication
15
1.3 · The Concept of Philosophy1 to improve the concept in order to make it sharper and to 
delete vagueness as much as possible.
It is clear that the explicated concept may not be identi￾cal to the original concept in its ordinary language. 
Nevertheless, the explication is not arbitrary. It is neces￾sary to make sure that the explicated concept is materially 
adequate in light of the original concept. There must thus 
be a connection between the original and the explicated 
concept. Although both do not need to have the same 
meaning, they must have a similar meaning. The expli￾cated concept must serve the same function and purpose 
as the original. Whether the explicated concept is materi￾ally adequate depends on the purpose. To elaborate, it is 
possible to explicate the concept of “fsh” as “vertebrates 
that live in the sea” when the purpose is to distinguish dif￾ferent animal habitats in the sea. Such a defnition, how￾ever, would not be adequate for the purpose of zoological 
classifcation. The explicated concept may be different 
from the original in terms of extension, but not in terms 
of function.
Another requirement of revisionist explication is that 
the explicated concept must be adequate to reality (empir￾ical signifcance). It must be possible to state which 
empirical facts must be given in order to satisfy the notion. 
This is also true for the revisionist explication of norms. 
There must be some connection between the normative 
concept and objective reality. Otherwise, we would be 
thinking about a normative order for nowhere-land.
The explication should also be adequate with respect 
to what I will call metaphysical parsimony. It is necessary 
to explicate the notion in question in such a way that its 
meaning depends as little as possible, or preferably not at 
all, on metaphysical presuppositions. This becomes clear 
when we consider the feature of the universality of human 
rights. The concept of human rights should be explicated 
in such a way that, if possible, it can be understood by all 
people regardless of their culture or religion. Metaphysical 
ideas are almost always, or at least very often, a matter of 
religious or quasi-religious belief without any possibility 
of rational confrmation. Metaphysical ideas are therefore 
dependent on religion, tradition, and other regional and 
cultural infuences that cannot be universalized.
Finally, the explication should lead to a distinct con￾cept. Only by means of unambiguous terms are important 
distinctions possible. Distinctness means that it must 
always be clear on what conditions and attributes the con￾Connectability
Empirical Signifcance
Metaphysical 
Parsimony
Distinctness
16 Chapter 1 · Introduction1
cept depends, regardless of whether the concept refers to a 
certain entity or to a specifc idea.
The other kind of explication is the descriptive explica￾tion. This kind of explication does not modify the meaning 
of the concept, but it should bring the deep structure of its 
content to light. One of the most prominent methods of 
descriptive explication is the transcendental analysis as 
developed by Immanuel Kant. The transcendental analy￾sis investigates the conditions of the possibility of a term.
A famous example is the concept of a promise. 
According to Kant, the binding power (validity) of a 
promise is based on the fact that holding the promise is the 
condition of the possibility that promises as a social real￾ity really exist. If people made promises without feeling 
obliged to honor them, the concept of a promise would 
lose all meaning. It would become an empty phrase. Thus, 
liability (binding power) is the condition of the possibility 
of promises existing or working at all.
A very common and useful instrument of philosophi￾cal thinking is the so-called thought experiment. Thought 
experiments are invented short stories with a contra fac￾tual scenario. By telling the story, we make use of a par￾ticular concept which may be tested through the 
experiment. A very famous example is Plato’s so-called 
“Cave Parable.” Plato uses this story in order to show the 
meaning of the concept “idea.” Thought experiments 
show the consequences of a particular understanding of a 
concept. In some cases, the consequences turn out to be 
absurd. In these cases, the thought experiment shows that 
our understanding of the concept in question is not appro￾priate and that we should think about another, better 
understanding of the concept. In other cases, thought 
experiments show the range of the concept, which can 
appear as very surprising but nevertheless meaningful. 
This explanation might sound very abstract. The next les￾son will familiarize you with thought experiments.
As I mentioned before, the foundation of human rights 
is not solely a philosophical business. We must also note 
the fndings of the empirical sciences. Therefore, the lec￾ture is not only a philosophical lecture. Furthermore, we 
must always ask whether our philosophical or empirical 
fndings can be implemented into the structure of our 
legal system and our legal thinking. Accordingly, our lec￾ture is neither a pure philosophical one nor a pure empiri￾cal one nor a pure juridical one. It is, rather, an 
interdisciplinary venture on a very sophisticated level.

1.3 · The Concept of Philosophy1 1.4 The Reasons in Favor of a Philosophical 
Analysis and Foundation of Human 
Rights
Finally, in this introduction I want to summarize the rea￾sons why it is useful to climb over the limits of legal doc￾trine and to refect on the foundation of human rights in 
an interdisciplinary manner.
There are at least four reasons why it is necessary and 
useful for jurists to have a proper knowledge about the 
fundamental ideas behind human rights:
1. The frst reason relates to the challenges of appropriate 
interpretation of those elements in human rights which 
describe the scope of protection. The defnition of the 
protection scope of many human rights is very nebu￾lous because codifcations of human rights tend to use 
very vague language. This vagueness has advantages 
and disadvantages.
The formulation of the particular human rights in 
our human rights codifcations goes back to particular 
historical experiences. New sources of human suffering 
led to new human rights. Nevertheless, human rights 
are not protocols of former historical events, but rather 
mechanisms of protection against future risks and dan￾gers to human beings. But therein lies a problem. 
History does not repeat itself exactly. Future events will 
never occur exactly the same as those in the past. 
Therefore, it is necessary to describe the scope of pro￾tection of every human right in terms which are wide 
enough to cover future variants of past threats—that 
are similar but not identical to those threats of the past. 
This is why human rights use more or less vague con￾cepts. By doing so, human rights can be what the 
ECtHR in the case “Tyrer” called a “living instrument.” 
This vagueness has the advantage that human rights 
can be applied to new, unpredictable situations.
This same vagueness, however, can also lead to a 
large uncertainty about the proper interpretation of 
human rights. We are therefore dependent on reason￾able and reliable criteria that allow for proper and well 
justifable interpretations of the protection scopes of 
human rights. These criteria are the ideas and princi￾ples behind human rights. Without considering these 
ideas, it is not possible to interpret the scope of protec￾tion of the particular human rights in a proper way. 
Vagueness
18 Chapter 1 · IntroductionTherefore, jurists need some knowledge about the foun￾dation of human rights.
2. The second reason relates to the challenges of appro￾priate interpretations of the restriction clauses. As you 
probably know, most human rights in the national and 
international catalogues are subject to reservations for 
varying reasons. The stated reasons very often are very 
vague. For example, some articles of the European 
Convention of Human Rights provide that the rights 
therein may be restricted by law and if the restriction is 
necessary in a democratic society; in the interests of 
national security, territorial integrity, or public safety; 
for the prevention of disorder or crime; for the protec￾tion of health or morals; for the protection of the repu￾tation or rights of others; for preventing the disclosure 
of information received in confdence; or for maintain￾ing the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
The wording of these clauses is so wide and vague 
that it seems that the state can reduce human rights to 
nothing. Only if you have a clear understanding of the 
concept of human rights in general and of the particu￾lar human right concerned are you then able to defne 
the limits of any possible restriction. Only on the basis 
of a proper understanding of the foundation of human 
rights can you then assess the case law about the limits 
of restriction and criticize it in a serious way that has a 
chance of convincing judges.
3. The third reason relates to the challenges that are con￾nected to the fact that we can be confronted with new 
risks and dangers to human life that are beyond the 
scope of any written human right which require us to 
ask whether it is possible to formulate new, currently 
unwritten human rights. Only if we have a proper 
knowledge about the foundation of human rights are 
we then able to derive new human rights using these 
basic principles. 
A paradigmatic situation which has led to the dis￾covery of a new unwritten human right, was the digital 
revolution, i.e., the invention of digital information 
technology and the invention and worldwide setup of 
the Internet. These developments led to the construc￾tion of new and unwritten human rights by national 
and international supreme courts. The frst example, so 
far as I know, was the declaration of the Right to 
Informational Self-Determination by the German 
Federal Constitutional Court in 1983. Meanwhile

1.4 · The Reasons in Favor of a Philosophical Analysis…1 recent human rights codifcations implemented that 
right so that it is now not unwritten anymore but part 
of the codifed corpus of human rights. Consider, for 
example, Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental 
Rights. Another example as recent as 2014 is the “Right 
to be forgotten,” as developed by the Court of the 
European Union in the case “Google Spain SL.”
4. The fourth reason behind the relevance of knowledge 
about the foundation of human rights relates to the 
risks that are connected with the possibility of discov￾ering new human rights. Due to this possibility, it is not 
surprising that we are often confronted with the claim 
of alleged human rights that are not actual human 
rights (e.g., a right to smoke, a right to consume drugs, 
a right to a collective identity, a right to posthumous 
dignity, etc.). It is a usual strategy in political propa￾ganda to claim the existence of a human right to push 
and enforce a certain partial, individual, or collective 
interest.
We can see very often that particular political and social 
interests are called human rights so as to give them higher 
weight and immunize the same against criticism. A closer 
analysis, however, shows that many of these interests in 
fact have nothing to do with human rights. In order to be 
able to distinguish between genuine human rights and 
merely purported human rights, we must have a very clear 
concept of human rights. We must know the defning ele￾ments of that very concept and check whether these ele￾ments are met in a particular case. The defning elements 
of human rights are exactly those which deliver the foun￾dation of human rights. And this is precisely the fourth 
reason why we should have some knowledge about the 
philosophical foundation of human rights.

Foundation of Human Rights: The Appropriate Moral 
Theory
In order to set up a suffcient philosophical foundation 
of human rights as moral rights, it is frst necessary to 
choose the appropriate understanding of morality. So, 
we must determine whether there is at least one among 
the classical theories of morality that could serve this 
purpose.
Moral Theories: Hedonism
The moral theory of Hedonism was developed in 
ancient Greece. A famous representative of this 
approach is Epicurus of Athens (351–270 BC). Accord￾ing to this theory, human beings are morally obliged to 
follow the rules to maximize their individual, sustain￾able happiness. Hedonists have no obligations toward 
others, only to themselves. Thus, there are no moral 
rights toward others because there are no duties owed 
toward others.
Moral Theories: Utilitarianism
The moral theory of Utilitarianism was developed in 
the nineteenth century by Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) 
and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). According to this 
theory, human beings are morally obliged to achieve 
the “greatest happiness for the greatest number” of all 
living entities who can experience pleasure and sadness 
and are able to suffer—the theory thus takes into 
account not just human beings, but also animals. The 
happiness or suffering of individuals or a minority can 
be offset against the happiness or suffering of a major￾ity. Therefore, this theory is not appropriate to justify 
subjective rights.
24 Chapter 2 · Utilitarian and Aristotelian Approach2
Moral Theories: Aristotelianism
In this lecture, Aristotelianism stands for a pattern of 
moral theories that are based on a certain understand￾ing of “the nature,” deriving moral obligations and 
rights from this factual source. Aristotle identifed this 
source with the polis and considered the human indi￾vidual a “political entity” (i.e., one whose meaning of 
life is to serve the community). The philosophers of the 
Stoa referred to the nature of the cosmos—the natural 
world order—as the source of moral duties. The Islamic 
philosopher Ibn Rushd (1126–1198) tried to bring this 
approach in accordance with the Islamic religion. His 
infuence led the Christian philosopher and theologian 
Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) to the opinion that the 
will of God as the creator of nature is the last source of 
morality. Martha Nussbaum (1947–) pursues an 
anthropological approach by deriving the rules of 
morality from the capabilities of a human person. All 
these variants of the Aristotelian approach suffer either 
from the naturalistic fallacy or from an infnite regress.
The Aristotelian approach is mostly connected with 
a teleological view. The world as a whole or all living 
entities or particular human beings are considered as 
having an inherent aim that they must follow—that is, 
humans live in accordance with the meaning of life.
Naturalistic Fallacy
The term Naturalistic Fallacy refers to the false logical 
conclusion from a fact (“Is”) to a norm (“Ought”). 
Originally, the term was coined by the English philoso￾pher George Edward Moore (1883–1958), who used 
this term in order to describe the mistake which occurs 
when “the good” is not understood as a property of its 
own (like “yellow”) but something that refers to natural 
facts (e.g., health, wellbeing). The logical mistake itself 
was discovered by the English philosopher David Hume 
(1711–1776)—“Hume’s Law”.
25
Utilitarian and Aristotelian Approach2
Infnite Regress of Justifcation
The idea that the will of God in his capacity as legisla￾tor can serve as the ultimate ground for the justifcation 
of moral rules avoids the naturalistic fallacy. Neverthe￾less, this notion cannot reconcile the fact that there is 
no reason to cut the chain of justifcation when it comes 
to God. Rather, there is a philosophical need to justify 
the position of God as legislator. It is necessary to show 
that God’s legislation—like any legislation—must be 
based on legitimacy. The possible legitimacy can only 
follow from the fact that God was endowed with the 
capacity of legislation by some higher ranked author￾ity. But the legitimacy of this higher ranked authority 
must come from another still higher authority. This 
leads to an infnite regress.
Methodological Individualism
The justifcation of moral rules requires the position of 
Methodological Individualism. The ultimate authority 
toward whom arguments of justifcation must be 
addressed can only be an entity that is endowed with 
reason and conscience. Reason refers to the ability to 
assimilate or to digest rational arguments. Conscience 
refers to the ability to establish a structure of meaning 
in life in order to set up a system of standards of orien￾tation for rational operations. Because only individual 
human persons are endowed with reason and con￾science, any kind of justifcation must be addressed 
toward human individual persons. A moral norm is 
only justifed toward an individual person when this 
person accepts it by using her capacity of reason and 
conscience. Moral norms that are not covered by a per￾son’s will are invalid for that person.
Normative Individualism
As the justifcation of a norm order depends on the 
individual ability of reason and conscience, it is unthink￾able that human individuals accept a norm order which 
does not protect their reason and conscience, or which is 
based on disrespect and disregard toward the individual 
competence of reason and conscience.

2.1 The Utilitarian Approach
We are looking for a foundation of human rights by philo￾sophical means. In other words: we try to fnd ground on 
which we can erect the building of human rights. But 
where should we start?
As we have seen in the frst lesson, codifed human 
rights are based on the idea of super-positive moral human 
rights. Moral human rights are rights which are based on 
morality. In order to fnd a reliable ground for human 
rights it is therefore a good idea to study the theory of 
morality.
Unfortunately, there is not only one such theory. In 
fact, the philosophy of ethics has developed several types 
of moral philosophy, requiring us to choose the one which 
is suffcient for our purpose. In this lesson, I want to deal 
with two kinds of moral theory. The frst one is called 
Utilitarianism. The other one can be called Aristotelianism 
or Natural Law Approach.
Let’s start with Utilitarianism. It is appropriate to start 
with this theory because it is the prevailing moral theory in 
English speaking countries, particularly the 
USA. Interestingly, the level of discussion about the foun￾dation of human rights in the USA is rather poor. In par￾ticular, the idea that human rights should—from a legal 
point of view—consider super-positive rights is not a pre￾vailing one. I assume that this has a lot to do with the 
prevailing moral theory.
Utilitarianism is a concept that was developed in the 
nineteenth century by the English philosophers Jeremy 
Bentham (1748–1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). 
There is, however, a very old predecessor of Utilitarianism. 
This was the so-called Hedonism, which was represented 
by some famous philosophers in ancient Greece, among 
them Epicurus of Athens. The Hedonists share the opin￾ion that human beings are morally obliged to only follow 
the rules that bring them the maximum level of individual, 
sustainable happiness.
 While the Hedonists think from the standpoint of the 
particular person who is considering what she should do, 
the Utilitarians consider the problem from a super-per￾sonal point of view. They do not focus on the happiness of 
particular persons, but rather the total amount of happi￾ness in the world. Maximizing happiness from each indi￾vidual’s perspective is not the relevant issue. What is 
Starting Point?
Hedonism
Utilitarianism
27
2.1 · The Utilitarian Approach2
relevant is the maximization of happiness of the whole 
society or, in the case of thinkers like Peter Singer, of the 
entireness of all living entities that can experience pleasure 
and sadness or suffering. The slogan is “greatest happiness 
for the greatest number.”
It is obvious that the Hedonist approach is an inade￾quate foundation for human rights. Hedonists only have 
obligations toward themselves. They have no obligations 
toward others. It is possible that a Hedonist may also 
respect the interest of others. But the only reason for this 
is that the happiness of the other makes himself happy. 
This might be the case when he loves the other or if the 
other is motivated to support the happiness of the 
Hedonist. If the other is of no interest to the Hedonist, 
then there is also no obligation to respect the other’s 
interests.
Human rights refer to mutual obligations that largely 
depend on the fact that the other is a human being. That is 
to say, such obligations are complementary and do not 
depend on the retroactive effect of the fulflment or non￾fulflment to the obliged person.
Even the Utilitarian approach is not an inadequate 
foundation for human rights. Indeed, the Utilitarian rec￾ognizes having obligations toward others, but these obliga￾tions do not relate to a right within the others. The benefts 
that someone receives from another who wants to fulfl a 
moral obligation are only an incidental side-effect of the 
interaction. The recipient of such an exchange is not rec￾ognized as an individual that holds rights or that has the 
moral power to issue commands. Fulflling any obligation 
in such a paradigm is only intended to enlarge the total 
amount of happiness in the world and not the happiness 
of any particular individual.
The inadequacy of the Utilitarian approach for the 
foundation of human rights becomes clearer through the 
“Trolley Problem.” (see . Fig. 2.1). The “Trolley Problem” 
is a thought experiment made famous by the description 
of the British philosopher Philippa Foot. In short, it tells 
the following story: A tram is out of control and threatens 
to overrun fve people. By changing a switch, the tram can 
be redirected to another track. Unfortunately, there is 
another person there. The question is now: Is the death of 
that person acceptable in order to save the lives of fve 
people? The Utilitarian answers: yes, because a world with 
fve survivors is a better world than a world with only one 
survivor. This result is sensible only under the assumption 
that there is no such thing like subjective rights.
Trolley Problem

Nevertheless, it is interesting to see that even 
Utilitarians are no longer sure of the answer if we slightly 
modify the thought experiment. Consider the following 
case (see . Fig. 2.2): There are four individuals. One of 
them suffers from lung cancer. He will die unless he under￾goes a lung transplant. The second one suffers from stom￾ach cancer. He will die unless he undergoes a stomach 
transplant. The third person suffers from a chronic kidney

disease. He too will die unless he undergoes a kidney 
transplant. The fourth person is healthy. The moral ques￾tion is whether there is an obligation to respect the life of 
the healthy person by accepting that the three others will 
die? Or, alternatively, is there an obligation to rescue the 
life of the three by killing the healthy person and trans￾planting his healthy organs to the ill persons? According 
to the Utilitarian approach, the answer depends on what is 
determined to be the relevant extra-moral value. Let us 
assume that this relevant value is the maximization of 
pleasure. Should the three ill persons die, they will have no 
more pleasure. Refraining from doing anything would 
lead to the result that three “portions of pleasure” will be 
destroyed while one “portion” will be rescued. 
Comparatively, if the healthy person is killed, then this 
person will not enjoy pleasure anymore. In this case, one 
“portion of pleasure” will be destroyed while the other 
three “portions” will be rescued. Therefore, the principle 
of maximization of pleasure leads to the moral obligation 
to dictate the killing of the healthy person and transplant￾ing their organs to the three ill persons.
The result of the Hospital Problem is contrary to the 
moral intuitions of most people. There, the healthy person 
must be killed directly as compared to the Trolley Problem 
where the death of the individual is “only” brought about 
by the changing of a switch—an indirect killing. The 
Hospital Problem thus urges Utilitarians to fnd a more 
satisfying solution that is consistent with moral intuitions. 
Accordingly, John Stuart Mill takes rights seriously in his 
book Utilitarianism. He accepts that society should pro￾tect certain interests of the individual, which presumes 
that society should recognize subjective rights. But accord￾ing to Mill, it is only common usefulness which delivers 
the reason for recognizing subjective rights. In other 
words, rights are derived from their common usefulness to 
society or their capacity to create happiness in society. The 
advantage for those who enjoy rights is thus only a side 
effect. The right bearers are not the focus of the rationale 
for having rights.
This shows that the Utilitarian approach is not able to 
appreciate the status of any single individual person as a 
bearer of absolute human rights. The beneft to society or 
the majority, or any other abstract concept beyond the 
single person, is the relevant benchmark for good and evil 
and not the human person.
30 Chapter 2 · Utilitarian and Aristotelian Approach2
To me, these short remarks seem to be enough to show 
that neither the Hedonist nor the Utilitarian approach 
can, in any case, deliver an adequate, comprehensive foun￾dation for human rights. Nevertheless, for the contempo￾rary discussion of human rights, it is very important to 
note the huge infuence of the Utilitarian approach. This 
is confrmed by a very special thought experiment. The 
German play writer Ferdinand von Schirach wrote the 
theatre play “Terror,” which was performed in many places 
around the world. The story is as follows: There is a trial 
against the military pilot Lars Koch, who is accused of 
murder. A terrorist had hijacked a passenger plane headed 
from Berlin to Munich with 164 people aboard. As the 
plane got within 15 km of its probably intended target, a 
football stadium flled with 70,000 people, Major Koch 
decided to shoot the plane down with an air-to-air missile 
to save the lives of the people in the stadium. The passen￾gers aboard the plane are all killed. The theatre audience is 
then asked whether the pilot should be sentenced for his 
actions. There is a website that reports the answers given 
by audiences from all over the world (7 http://terror.
theater/). The reports show that an average of 63% of 
audiences vote “not guilty.” When the flm “Terror” was 
broadcasted on German television in 2016, the result of 
the same inquiry was an average of 87% of audiences vot￾ing “not guilty”. This result indicates that moral feeling all 
over the world is seemingly steered by Utilitarian ideas. 
They think of the numbers of victims and not of the pas￾sengers’ human right to live. But it is certainly not the case 
that these people undervalue human rights. The more 
likely explanation is that they have a very vague concept of 
human rights.
2.2 The Aristotelian Approach
The label “Aristotelian approach” stands here for a great 
multitude of different moral theories, which have, how￾ever, important characteristics in common. Aristotle (385–
323  BC) is the famous ancient Greek philosopher who 
gave theories of this kind a very sophisticated shape. His 
philosophy thus had a huge infuence on other similar 
approaches. However, the moral theories infuenced by 
Aristotle are only examples of a pattern that can be found 
in all cultures of the world. Therefore, I use the term 
31
2.2 · The Aristotelian Approach2
Aristotelian approach or Aristotelianism to refer to this 
very pattern.
At frst glance, the Aristotelian approach seems a good 
candidate for a foundation of human rights. His approach 
accepts obligations toward each other and it is compatible 
with the idea of mutual rights, although subjective rights 
are recognized neither in Aristotle’s work nor in any other 
classical variant of this approach. Above all, the 
Aristotelian approach seems to be adequate because of its 
universal commonness. The Aristotelian approach is char￾acterized by the following features:
1. Human individuals are considered “political entities.” 
The idea that human beings are political entities means 
that human individuals are not subjects for themselves. 
They are not “ends in itself” (Kant). Rather, they are 
only elements and parts of a political community. As 
citizens, they have to work for the common good. Only 
as private men (Greek: idiotes) can they pursue their 
own private interests. The private sphere is the family 
and the household. It is organized in a patriarchal 
manner: the father is the owner of the household and 
family. Spouses, children, and servants are like the ani￾mals, the house, and the ground—all of which are the 
property of the father. The public sphere is the sphere 
of politics. In this sphere, men are equal citizens. So, 
the meaning of life for spouses, children, servants, and 
animals is to serve the house (oikos) and the father in 
the private sphere while the meaning of life of the 
father is to serve the community in the public sphere as 
an equal among equals.
2. The second element of the classical Aristotelian 
approach is the responsibility toward the public opin￾ion and not toward individual reason and conscience. 
The standard of morality is the public opinion. This 
includes standards of political or judicial action. Here, 
the majority decides what is right and wrong. The opin￾ion of the single individual is only relevant in the pro￾cess of forming opinions. But when the people (demos) 
have voted, not only is the majority opinion the stron￾gest, it is considered the only true opinion. This is why 
rational opposition against the majority is unthinkable.
3. The third element is the teleological view of the world 
(cosmos). Aristotelianism is based on teleological meta￾physics. According to this idea, every element of nature 
including humans, society, and culture, has a certain 
aim (telos) that is inscribed in it by nature. In the same

32 Chapter 2 · Utilitarian and Aristotelian Approach2
way as it is the natural aim of an apple tree to produce 
apples, it is the natural aim of humans to serve the 
community and to live in accordance to certain moral 
standards.
4. The teleological approach led to the idea of the natural 
law of morals. According to this idea, it is not only a 
fact that apple trees produce apples, but it is their duty 
to produce apples. A tree that does not produce apples 
is therefore bad not only in a functional sense but in a 
moral sense. The idea of the natural law of morals was 
frst developed by the Greek philosophy of the Stoa.
Islamic and Christian philosophers and theologians took 
over this idea. It was frst the Andalusian Islamic philoso￾pher Ibn Rushd, also known as Averoes in the West, who 
systematically explored the work of Aristotle, translating 
it into Arabic and establishing an Islamic philosophy on 
the basis of the Aristotelian ideas. The infuence of Ibn 
Rushd for the Islamic world was, however, very small. His 
Rationalism clashed against the religious thinking of 
mainstream Islam outside of Europe. He was considered a 
heretic. The collapse of the Andalusian Caliphate in 1031 
and the fnal surrender of the Emirate of Cordoba in 1492 
fnished his infuence in the Islamic world. Nevertheless, 
his infuence in the Western world was groundbreaking. 
He brought the knowledge of the work of Aristotle to the 
West and it was in particular Thomas Aquinas who estab￾lished the philosophy of Aristotle as the basis of Western 
theological thinking. Ibn Rushd’s Rationalism developed 
further into the beginning of scientifc thinking in Western 
Europe.
The main change in the Aristotelian approach that the 
Islamic and Christian philosophers made related to the 
ideas of the source of natural moral law. According to the 
Stoa, natural moral law was considered similar to how the 
contemporary man understands laws of nature as within 
the meaning of physics and other empirical sciences. 
Nevertheless, the modern distinction between the laws of 
nature and moral laws was only possible through the dis￾tinction that philosophers and theologians have made in 
the Middle Ages. For them, the source of moral laws was 
no longer the nature as such but rather the personal will of 
God. God was considered a personal entity that issues 
commandments which human beings were obliged to fol￾low. The theologian modifcation of the Aristotelian 
approach led to some changes in the conception of the 
Natural Law

Islam

2.2 · The Aristotelian Approach2
relationship of individual and society. But the structure 
remained the same.
1. Human individuals were considered “subjects of God.” 
The society was considered a cooperation that had to 
serve God. The idea remained that human individuals 
were considered only elements and parts of a political 
community. But the structure of the society (Islamic: 
Ummah) was no longer considered as a natural struc￾ture, but one based on divine rule.
2. Furthermore, the theological approach differs from the 
classical Aristotelian approach by the reference to the 
authority toward whom there is a moral responsibility. 
The driver is no longer the public opinion but the will 
of God—that is, the moral rules issued by God. The 
class of priests and similar religious agents have the 
capacity and power to interpret the divine rules. 
Democracy is replaced by a hierarchical structure. On 
the top is a king whose legitimacy is derived from the 
will of God. The individual is only a subject of his 
power. The decision of the king, when it is in accor￾dance with the opinion of the religious leaders, is not 
only the most powerful one. It is the only true one.
3. The theologian approach can also be interpreted as a 
teleological approach. Nevertheless, is it not one’s 
nature which defnes the aims of life, but God. Every 
individual, however, has a certain aim or telos that is 
inscribed in it. It remains the aim of humans to serve 
the community and to live in accordance to certain 
divine moral standards.
4. The idea of natural law is converted into the idea of 
divine law. But the content is more or less the same. It is 
crucial to note that in this structure the individual only 
has a serving position and role. It does not possess 
rights.
It is further necessary to mention that the theological 
approach in the Islamic world led to very similar results 
despite ignoring the Aristotelian heritage. The reason for 
this is easy to understand. Aristotle did not develop a new 
conception of the relationship between society and the 
individual. He only interpreted the given social structure 
of his culture in a philosophical manner. He gripped the 
world which he encountered with words. The structure 
and manner of thinking that he had about the world, how￾ever, is a variation of a pattern that you can fnd in every 
traditional society around the world.
The Will of God
Divine Law
34 Chapter 2 · Utilitarian and Aristotelian Approach2
The Aristotelian approach is still alive. Nowadays, it is 
very often expressed with vocabulary that was not com￾mon in ancient Greece or in the Middle Ages or in any 
traditional society. Still, this modern vocabulary is used to 
express very old ideas. You can fnd papers and books 
defending the Aristotelian approach by using phrases like 
“human rights” or “human dignity.” Human rights or 
human dignity in this sense partly refer to a certain kind 
of freedom and partly to a certain kind of duties. Freedom 
is meant as freedom from any obstacles which could hin￾der the pursuit of the natural aims of a human being. It is 
the freedom to meet your duties and nothing else.
For example, because it is the natural aim of a woman 
to give birth to children, or the divine will that she does so, 
women have the human right to not be hindered from 
marrying and begetting children. On the other side, if a 
woman decides not to marry and/or beget children (or not 
to get more children), then she pursues aims that are con￾trary to the law of nature or to the will of God. Therefore, 
she not only has no human right to act as she has decided 
to do, but according to the natural or the divine law, she is 
obliged to abandon pursuing her own plans. Consequently, 
it is permitted to force her to marry or to beget (more) 
children, etc. This Aristotelian concept of human rights is 
thus more accurately characterized as a concept of human 
duties. Put differently, every human has certain rights but 
they will forfeit these rights if they act contrary to their 
natural aims.
An example for this modern variant of the Aristotelian 
Approach is Miklós Maróth’s paper about “Human 
Dignity in the Islamic World.” According to Maróth, the 
elevated position of humans, as compared to that of the 
angels, is based on free will. God has endowed humans 
with free will and “in turn”, he charged them with duties. 
If a man obeys Allah’s commandments, he will be digni￾fed and receive benefts, otherwise he will be punished. 
Maróth concedes that the word “human dignity” was not 
known in the times when Islam was founded and the 
Quran was written. Nevertheless, he uses this expression in 
order to explain very old religious ideas with modern 
words.
A Christian variation of this approach is portrayed in 
the book Persons. The Difference between “Someone” and 
“Something” by Robert Spaemann. Spaemann recognizes 
that the essential characteristic of persons is to be able to 
decide between Good and Evil. They are also able to rec￾Aristotelianism Today

2.2 · The Aristotelian Approach2
ognize what is the Good. But they have in themselves no 
reason to act according to the Good. He writes:
» That everything is permissible if God does not exist … is 
true even if the content of morality is accessible indepen￾dently of any religious conviction. What remains incom￾prehensible without such a conviction is why we should 
do what we have recognized as the best for all, if impor￾tant interests of our own are opposed to it. Indeed, what 
does it mean at all that we ought to do anything. Having 
insight in values does not compel people to submit to 
them. (p. 105, German edition).
Another example of the Aristotelian approach is the so￾called Capability Approach of the American philosopher 
Martha Nussbaum. She starts neither from the traditional 
morality of a given society nor from the will of God, but 
from an intuitive anthropological approach that concerns 
itself with the basic capabilities that are crucial for being a 
human being. One of these basic capabilities is, for exam￾ple, the awareness of corporeality. From this capability 
follows the capability to eat or fast. Human beings are 
therefore endowed with the right to choose between eating 
and fasting. It is a violation of their rights if they are 
deprived from this choice—as is the case of starving. Here 
we again fnd a teleological thinking. Nussbaum concludes 
from the natural capability of eating or omitting to eat a 
right to food and a right to fast according to one’s own 
free will.
Regardless of which variant of the Aristotelian 
approach we consider, none of them are convincing when 
it comes to identifying an adequate philosophical basis for 
human rights. This can be shown by a deeper analysis.
The most relevant counter-argument against every 
conception of natural law is the fact that they confuse the 
meaning of “be” and “ought”.
The assumption that everything in nature has an inher￾ent aim does not imply that something or someone has the 
duty to follow its aim. A natural tendency is a simple fact, 
something that we describe with the word “be.” The natu￾ral tendency for apples to emerge from apple trees is only 
a fact in this sense. This does not entail that apple trees 
have an obligation to produce apples.
In contrast, the word “ought” is used not when talking 
about natural tendencies but about free decisions between 
alternatives. Duties, obligations, or statements with 
“ought” can only play a role where we have to face behav￾Example 3
Be/Ought Confusion
36 Chapter 2 · Utilitarian and Aristotelian Approach2
ior based on the ability to not only follow natural tenden￾cies, but also to refuse to follow such tendencies and act 
contrary to them. Where such abilities are exercised, we 
talk about free will. Free will is based on the consideration 
of arguments and on a process of balancing of alterna￾tives. This is a completely different procedure than follow￾ing natural tendencies. When we want to allege certain 
duties, we have to point to arguments in favor of such 
duties while at the same time indicating that the counter￾arguments are less convincing. Natural-Law-theories are 
always based on a conclusion from facts to norms, from 
descriptions to prescriptions. Nevertheless, conclusions of 
that kind are logically fawed. Inherent aims within the 
meaning of Aristotle, or capabilities within the meaning 
of Martha Nussbaum, are only facts. Aristotle as well as 
Nussbaum move from facts to norms, but such a conclu￾sion is logically fawed.
The gap between “is” and “ought” and the logical 
impossibility of fnding a norm from a fact was frst 
addressed by the English philosopher David Hume (1711–
1776). It is called Hume’s Law. Very often, it is also called 
a naturalistic fallacy. This notion was coined by the British 
philosopher George Edward Moore (1873–1958), but it 
had a slightly different meaning originally. (He meant that 
the word “good” refers to an independent property of 
things and cannot be translated with words for other prop￾erties such as healthy, brave, rich etc.)
The theological modifcation of the natural law con￾ception into a legality conception recognizes this counter￾argument. It replaces natural facts through a divine rule. 
The divine rule is a norm and from this norm follows what 
we ought to do. Norms follow norms. God is considered a 
legislator and human beings are considered the subjects of 
the divine law who are bound to it. The binding tie between 
a rule and a person is what we call an obligation or duty. 
So, at a frst glance, we can see that the theological 
approach seems to avoid the naturalistic fallacy.
But let us have a deeper view. What is the element that 
leads to the binding effect of the divine law? The answer of 
the Qur’an, for example, includes a reference to punish￾ment by God. Nevertheless, punishment is only a matter 
of facts. We have to once again ask how it should be pos￾sible to conclude the existence of an obligation from a 
crude fact.
It is important to see that the threat of punishment is 
never an argument in favor of duties. Otherwise, we would 
Hume’s Law
37
2.2 · The Aristotelian Approach2
be obliged to give our wallet to a robber when he threatens 
us with a knife. If we were to think that we are obliged to 
give our wallets to the robber only because he forces us to 
do so, we would inadvertently recognize that the robber 
has a right to get our wallets. In other words, we would 
consider crude violence as the source of rights. This is 
obviously nonsense.
Therefore, force can never give rise to duties and obli￾gations. From this insight follows that we can never be 
obliged to follow the commandments of God simply 
because God threatens us with punishment. It might be 
strategically smart to follow the commandments of God 
in order to avoid punishment. Nevertheless, this would be 
analogous to the case where we decide to follow the 
demands of a robber in order to avoid severe harm.
Accordingly, duties and obligations, or rules in gen￾eral, do not fnd a valid basis in natural tendencies or 
divine penalty or any other kind of violence. So, we need 
alternative reasons to underlie the validity of norms.
There is a more sophisticated argument in favor of the 
possibility of deriving norms from natural tendencies. 
This is the argument of the meaning of life which follows 
from the teleological view of nature.
Importantly, meaning of life is to be distinguished from 
meaning in life. Meaning in life refers to the aims and tar￾gets that we choose on the basis of our own free will. If 
you have decided to become a lawyer, you will read certain 
books, visit certain lectures, meet certain people, pass cer￾tain exams, etc. All these activities are directed to one aim, 
namely the aim of becoming a lawyer. Becoming a lawyer 
is one of your possible meanings in life.
The concept of meaning of life means something dif￾ferent. It means that your entire life, your existence as a 
whole, serves a certain purpose beyond your life. If such a 
meaning of life exists, it would be prudent to orientate 
your life in that direction. But, can such a meaning beyond 
your life exist?
According to Aristotle, citizens must serve the beneft 
of the community. Aristotle considers the beneft of the 
community to be an aim beyond the life of the individual 
citizen. But beware: Aristotle does not argue that we 
should serve the beneft of the community because bene￾ftting the community is in fact tantamount to beneftting 
its members. In other words, Aristotle did not believe that 
we serve our own beneft when we serve the beneft of the 
community. Instead, he thought that the ultimate aim is 
Meaning of Life
38 Chapter 2 · Utilitarian and Aristotelian Approachthe beneft of the community and not the benefts of its 
members. The benefts of its members were considered 
only contingent side-effects rather than the meaning of 
serving the beneft of the community. This is why citizens 
can be obliged to sacrifce their lives for the beneft of the 
community.
Nevertheless, we have to realize that from the view of 
the citizen it makes no sense to serve the beneft of the 
community if the community as such does not have a 
meaning for itself. There must be a meaning and purpose 
beyond the beneft of the community. If the existence of 
the community does not have some further meaning, then, 
of course, serving the community is also meaningless. But 
what could be the meaning of life of the community? 
Aristotle and the philosophers of the Stoa would answer 
that the meaning of life of a community is to follow the 
cosmological order.
On this step the same question occurs: Serving the cos￾mological order only makes sense if there is a meaning 
beyond the cosmological order, which the cosmological 
order then serves. The ancient Greek philosophers didn’t 
ask this question and therefore their entire approach 
shows severe defciencies.
The theologians of the Middle Ages—both Islamic 
and Christian—delivered an answer to the question posed 
above. The meaning of the entire cosmological order or, in 
other words, the meaning of creation, is the satisfaction of 
God. Nature serves the beneft of God. The community 
serves the beneft of nature. The citizen serves the beneft 
of the community. The frst link in the chain is connected 
with the last link in the chain. By serving the beneft of the 
community, the citizen ultimately serves the beneft of 
God. Accordingly, there is a meaning of life for every indi￾vidual.
Nevertheless, this conclusion is short-circuited. The 
beneft of God ensures a meaning of life for human indi￾viduals only if there is a meaning beyond the beneft of 
God. So, we have to ask whether there is a purpose of life 
for God. Thus, it is now evident that this structure of argu￾mentation cannot lead to a fnal result, it only leads to an 
infnite regress. This shows that the concept of the mean￾ing of life is based on a confusion of thought. There is no 
meaning of life. If we give up the idea of meaning of life, 
we give up the idea of a teleological view of nature at the 
same time.

2.2 · The Aristotelian Approach2
If we refuse the idea of a teleological view of nature, 
we have at the same time lost the basis of the idea of the 
human being as a political entity and the idea of responsi￾bility toward the public opinion. There is nothing beyond 
individual reason and conscience that could provide a 
basis for the political order and justice and moral or legal 
compulsoriness among human beings.
Please, be aware of the character of my argumentation 
against the Aristotelian approach and its theological mod￾ifcations. I do not argue from an empirical point of view. 
I do not opine that natural law does not exist or that God 
does not exist or that God does not issue laws, etc. In other 
words, I do not criticize religious or metaphysical beliefs 
from an external point of view. I do not confront religious 
belief with an atheistic belief, etc. My argumentation is 
only based on logic. It is an internal criticism against some 
conclusions of metaphysical or religious beliefs which are 
contrary to logic. Having identifed these logical inconsis￾tencies, however, does not exclude that there is an accept￾able basis for religious or metaphysical beliefs in general.
2.3 Requirements for an Adequate Theory 
of Foundation
From the criticism against the Hedonist, Utilitarian, and 
Aristotelian approaches, we can learn something about 
the requirements that an adequate theory of foundation 
of human rights must have. There are two fundamental 
requirements:
1. Methodological Individualism. Any argumentation in 
favor of the philosophical foundation of human rights 
must always be addressed to an entity that is considered 
the source of justifcation. When identifying this source, 
it is necessary to avoid both the naturalistic fallacy and 
an infnite regress. Nevertheless, the entity of justifca￾tion must provide a last reference i.e., a fnal and stable 
ground. This entity must be able to assimilate or digest 
rational arguments. In other words, the entity of justif￾cation must be endowed with rationality or reason.
Rational arguments are always aligned with a fnal 
purpose. These fnal purposes are what we can call the 
meaning in life. They are the standards of orientation 
for rational operations. The entity of justifcation must 
Methodological 
Individualism
40 Chapter 2 · Utilitarian and Aristotelian Approachtherefore be endowed with the ability to establish a 
structure of meaning in life in order to set up a system 
of standards of orientation for rational operations. 
This ability is called conscience. In other words, entities 
of justifcation must be endowed with conscience as 
well.
The only entity in the world that is endowed with 
reason and conscience is the individual human person. 
From this follows that every kind of ascription or justi￾fcation of obligations must be acceptable for every 
single human individual to whom the obligation should 
be ascribed.
Every individual person can only approve argu￾ments for themself. It is not possible to only select some 
individuals as representatives for the entirety of man￾kind. Rather, it is inevitable that every single human 
individual approves the norm order vis-à-vis their own 
reason and their own conscience, or at least they could 
approve them if they took a stand on it. Therefore, it is 
never enough to show that the norm order serves the 
beneft of the community or the beneft of God or the 
greatest happiness of the greatest number. Instead, it is 
necessary to show that every single person has good 
reasons to accept the norm in question because the 
norm is useful for her in order to pursue her own mean￾ing in life.
2. From Methodological Individualism follows what we 
call Normative Individualism. Recognizing that justify￾ing a norm order depends on the individual ability of 
reason and conscience, it is unthinkable that human 
individuals accept a norm order which does not protect 
their reason and conscience or does not recognize or 
otherwise disregards the individual’s competences of 
reason and conscience. Regardless of the norm order 
that is ultimately accepted by prospective individuals, 
one set of normative elements must always be present, 
namely basic norms that protect the individual’s reason 
and conscience. Norms of that kind are called human 
rights. Human rights are nothing else than the totality 
of all conditions that must be met in order to ensure the 
conditions of reason and conscience. Human rights 
must protect the core of the human individual as the 
last and highest reference point of every legal order.

Social Contract Theories
Social contract theories always consist of three ele￾ments: (1) individualism, (2) contractual autonomy, 
and (3) a certain conception of a natural state (Rawls: 
original position).
Individualism refers to the fact that only human 
individuals, as opposed to collectives, can be consid￾ered parties of the original social contract.
Contractual autonomy refers to the ability of 
human individuals to give up individual freedom by 
binding themselves, by making promises, and by enter￾ing a contract.
Natural state (original position) refers to the idea 
of a state of life before the social contract has been con￾cluded. This situation explains why individuals are 
rationally motivated to enter a contract. The natural 
state is not a real historic state, but only a contra-fac￾tual story in the frame of a thought experiment.
The different social-state-theories differ from each 
other in their respective descriptions of the natural 
state.
The Social Contract Theory of Thomas Hobbes 
(1588–1679)
Hobbes describes the natural state in terms of human 
individuals devoid of any sense of sociality and emo￾tional, moral, or legal ties to each other. They are lone￾some, selfsh agents who distrust each other and always 
fght each other. In such situations, human beings are 
driven by self-preservation to enter into social con￾tracts. In such a contract, they mutually renounce the 
exercise of self-determination. Only the king is not part 
of the contract. Therefore, the king is the only one who 
is able to determine himself. This puts him in the posi￾tion of sovereign ruler over all other individuals of a 
society, who in turn become his subjects.
Recognizing that the judicial ties between the subjects 
only relates to the mutual renunciation of self-determina￾tion, there is then no subjective right of the subjects 
toward each other or toward the king. Therefore, the 
Hobbesian conception of the social contract does not 
provide any foundation or justifcation for human rights.
44 Chapter 3 · The Social Contract Approach3
The Social Contract Theory of John Locke 
(1632–1704)
According to Locke, human individuals in the natural 
state are already endowed with human rights. Human 
rights are considered part of their nature as created by 
God. The rights are vague and therefore a matter of 
interpretation. The fact that every individual has the 
right to interpret its own rights leads to partisan inter￾pretations and misuse. Therefore, individuals have good 
reasons for establishing a public authority with a 
monopoly over the interpretation of rights and the 
power to protect or enforce them. The establishing of 
such an authority is the content of the social contract.
The Lockesian approach allows two different inter￾pretations. According to the frst interpretation, human 
rights are considered part of the human nature. This 
approach is not an adequate justifcation for human 
rights because it is based on a naturalistic fallacy. 
According to the second interpretation, human rights 
are enacted by God, who is considered a legislator. This 
argumentation leads to an infnite regress because God 
as legislator needs legitimation.
The Social Contract Theory of Jean Jacques 
Rousseau (1712–1778)
According to Rousseau, the natural state was a real era 
in history. It was characterized by very small groups of 
individuals who were closely connected through ties of 
love and affection. This “golden age” came to its end 
with the invention of agriculture and private property. 
The natural state thus became a state that was charac￾terized by inequality and economical expropriation. 
Individuals enter into social contracts to avoid inequal￾ity through equal political participation. According to 
the contract, the state is ruled by the volonté générale, 
which consists of the unanimous vote of all members in 
society. In practice, however, the requirement of una￾nimity leads to the complete inability to act. Therefore, 
in practice, majority votes rule and the majority can 
oppress minorities.
45
The Social Contract Approach3
The Social Contract Theory of John Rawls 
(1921–2002)
According to Rawls, the original position is character￾ized through a society whose members want to enter a 
social contract to establish rules for a fair distribution 
of the benefts and burdens of their cooperation. 
Human individuals share a conservative, careful atti￾tude toward unpredictable risks (Maximin Principle). 
Individuals vote only for fair principles of distribution 
if they have to vote behind a veil of ignorance—i.e., 
under uncertainty about their own future position in 
society. Behind the veil of ignorance, people vote for 
the liberty principle, the difference principle, and the 
principle of equal access to privileged positions. The 
liberty principle refers to the maximum of liberty that 
is only restricted by the same amount of liberty that 
any other member of society enjoys. Rawls considers 
the content of liberty more or less identical to the cata￾logue of classic human rights. According to the differ￾ence principle, social and economic inequalities are 
acceptable if they bring greater benefts to the most dis￾advantaged members of a given society, placing them in 
a better position than under any other kind of distribu￾tion. The principle of equal access demands equal 
opportunity for every member of society to achieve 
privileged social and economic positions within society.
The conception of John Rawls is an inadequate jus￾tifcation for human rights because it justifes rights 
only for the members of a particular society without 
providing reasons supporting a right to access that 
society. Rawls’ theory refers therefore only to civil 
rights and not to human rights.
3.1 The Theory of Social Contract
As we have seen in the last lesson, the philosophical foun￾dation for human rights can neither be based on the 
Utilitarian approach nor on the Aristotelian approach 
because both approaches—unlike the social contract 
approach—are not based on the two principles of 
Methodological Individualism and Normative 
Individualism. Therefore, we must investigate whether the 
social contract approach is an adequate candidate for the 
foundation of human rights.
46 Chapter 3 · The Social Contract Approach3
The social contract approach is strongly represented in 
Anglo-Saxon political philosophy. The idea rose in the 
beginning of the European Renaissance and was frst for￾mulated by the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes 
(1588–1679).
Perhaps you know that some philosophers of the 
Middle Ages have already argued in favor of the idea of a 
social contract (Marsilius of Padua, Althusius). The idea 
of these philosophers was that the legitimization of royal 
power is based on a contract between the people and the 
king according to which there is a mutual relationship of 
trust and loyalty between the two. The people, as an origi￾nal corporate entity, was considered one of the parties to 
the contract. This was an idea in the frame of the 
Aristotelian approach because individuals did not play 
any role in this conception.
In the frame of the modern idea of the social contract, 
“the people” or the community is not considered an origi￾nal agent. According to the principles of Normative 
Individualism, society is made up of individuals, and the 
individuals are the actual agents and parties of the con￾tract. The community—we should prefer to speak of 
“society”—is only established through the social contract. 
Society is the result of the contract rather than simply one 
of the contracting parties.
3.2 Thomas Hobbes
Thomas Hobbes was the frst representative of the modern 
idea of the social contract. Although his conception of the 
social contract is very different from later conceptions, we 
can identify in Hobbes three elements which are typical for 
every theory of social contract.
The frst element is what we can call Individualism. Let 
us briefy go over what Individualism is. Individualism is 
the idea that the individual is no longer seen as merely a 
dependent part of the community, intended only to serve 
the purposes of the community. Instead, the individual is 
seen as self-centered, but possibly selfsh entity that is 
interested only in maximizing its own goods. The value of 
the individual depends neither from its use for the com￾munity nor its use for its fellow individuals. Value depends 
only from the relation of the individual to itself. Individuals 
are not bound by nature or by God to a meaning or pur￾pose beyond such meaning and instead freely choose their

3.2 · Thomas Hobbes3
own purposes. There is no obligation for them by nature 
or by God. So, they can be bound to obligations only by 
self-binding, based on consent. The foundation of moral 
or juridical liability can, if at all, only be created by the 
individuals themselves.
The second element of the theory of social contract is 
what we call Contractual Autonomy. Contractual auton￾omy refers to the ability to give up individual freedom by 
making a promise and entering into a contract.
The third element of the social contract approach is 
the idea of what may be called Natural State. Theories of 
social contract always begin with the idea of a state of life 
before contract has been entered. This situation is tradi￾tionally called Natural State. John Rawls replaced this 
expression by the term Original Position. This term has the 
advantage of avoiding the misleading imagery of the for￾mer term. It makes clear that this element of the social 
contract theory does not refer to a historic state in the 
past, but to an element in a thought experiment. 
Accordingly, neither the Original Position nor the social 
contract should be considered real facts in history. It is, 
however, not clear whether Hobbes understood his own 
argumentation as a thought experiment or as a series of 
claims about certain historical events. But we should be 
aware that we are not talking about historical events, but 
about a philosophical thought experiment.
The differences between the particular theories of 
social contract are differences in the descriptions of the 
natural state, i.e., the original position.
According to Hobbes, the natural state is characterized 
through human individuals without any ability or sense 
for sociality (see . Fig. 3.1). They are not connected to 
each other by emotional, moral, or legal ties. They are 
lonesome, selfsh agents who distrust each other and are 
always fghting for the scarce resources necessary for sur￾vival. The natural state endangers their interest in self￾preservation and, therefore, the individuals want to end it. 
They want to bring themselves into a state of peace and 
security.
In order to conclude the natural state, the individuals 
mutually renounce the exercise of self-determination. 
They take only one person out of this mutual renuncia￾tion, namely the king. The king is not a party to the con￾tract and remains in the natural state. He can make 
determinations not just about himself but also all others 
because he is the only one who has not renounced his self￾Autonomy
Natural State
48 Chapter 3 · The Social Contract Approach3
. Fig. 3.1 Hobbes’ conception
determination. As a result, the king becomes the owner of 
sovereign rule. Sovereignty and legitimacy of state power 
is not based on law or morality, but rather solely on the 
subjects’ renunciation of self-determination and the will 
of the king to rule over all his subjects for the sake of his 
own interests.
The only beneft of this kind of social contract is the 
absence of war where everyone fghts against everyone. 
There is no moral or juridical relation between the sub￾jects and the king; the only relations are between the sub￾jects themselves. The judicial tie between the subjects only 
relates back to the mutual renunciation of self￾determination. The subjects do not have a positive right 
toward each other or toward the king. So, the Hobbesian 
conception of social contract does not deliver any founda￾tion or justifcation for human rights.
3.3 John Locke
Human rights come into view if we turn to the contract￾theory of John Locke. Like in the theory of Thomas 
Hobbes, we fnd with Locke the three elements of every 
social contract theory: individualism, contractual auton￾omy, and a conception of the natural state. Nevertheless, 
the design of natural state is quite different.
Like with Hobbes, the individuals are considered iso￾lated beings without any social ties. But contrary to 
Hobbes, they are endowed with human rights. Human 
rights are particular entitlements that each individual has 
49
3.3 · John Locke3
. Fig. 3.2 Locke’s conception
toward every other individual. The human rights are con￾ferred by God and can be analyzed in three elements (see 
. Fig. 3.2):
1. They have a particular scope of protection: life, free￾dom, and property. Accordingly, there are three differ￾ent human rights. The right to freedom is, however, 
subdivided into certain distinct freedoms. The most 
important one is the freedom of religion, another one 
is the freedom to free trade and business.
2. All human rights embrace the right to defend them￾selves—by means of violence, if necessary. Locke called 
these means of violence punishment. In other words, 
every bearer of a human right is authorized by God to 
punish those who violate or threaten to violate their 
rights.
3. Human rights are a subject of interpretation. They are 
not very clearly defned. For some situations, it is ques￾tionable whether they are even applicable. The bearer 
of the right, however, is endowed by God with the 
authority to give the authoritative interpretation.
From the individual right to interpret one’s own human 
rights in situations in which the individual itself is involved 
follows that the individual’s interpretation of the right is 
infuenced through partisan interests. Therefore, the indi￾vidual interpretation is always at risk of being distorted 
and made false. False interpretation of human rights lead 
Protection Scope

50 Chapter 3 · The Social Contract Approach3
to the risk that the right to punishment will be misused. 
The individual could defend a right that it does not actu￾ally hold. So, a signifcant high risk of unjustifed violence 
is an essential element of the natural state.
In order to avoid these risks, it is a reasonable option 
for the individuals to enter a social contract with the aim 
of establishing a state and transferring to this state the 
individual right to interpretation and the individual right 
to punishment. In doing so, the state becomes the central 
authority, endowed by the people (here: by every member 
of the society!) with the sole competence of jurisdiction 
over the interpretation of the rights of citizens and a 
monopoly over legal violence. The communization of 
interpretation and punishment further leads to a positive 
side-effect: the individual is not limited by its own weak 
forces, but can use the combined forces of society to pro￾tect its rights. So, the defense of everyone’s human rights is 
much more effective than is the case in the natural state.
It is important to see that, according to Locke, the 
social contract is not the foundation of human rights. The 
foundation of human rights is the will of God, who has 
endowed his human creations with certain human rights. 
The only function of the social contract is to compensate 
some defciencies of the divine gift in order to avoid injus￾tice in the application of human rights.
The Lockean conception was the paradigm of consti￾tutional law in the United States of America. We can see 
that very clearly in Section 1 of the frst American consti￾tution, the Virginia Bill of Rights of 12 June 1776 (see 
. Fig. 3.3). In particular, the frst section of this constitu￾tion deals with human rights while the other sections deal 
with the organization of state power. Only two other arti￾cles could be recognized as referring to human rights, 
namely freedom of the press under section 12 and freedom 
of religion under section 16.
Constitutional Law
. Fig. 3.3 Virginia bill of rights section 1
51
3.3 · John Locke3
In contrast to Locke, Section 1 of the Virginia Bill of 
Rights does not trace human rights back to the will of 
God, but to “nature.” Nevertheless, this is not really a con￾trast to Locke. The drafters of the Virginian constitution 
shared Locke’s view that “nature” is the creation of God. 
By nature therefore means that human rights are inherent 
in the same way that reason and conscience are inherent to 
human beings. Human rights are part of humans’ natural 
constitution in accordance with the master plan of God’s 
creation.
Another important point to note is that section 1 
stresses the fact that human rights cannot be deprived or 
divested by contract (=compact). They are not something 
that can be disposed of by humans because they are 
inalienable and irrevocable. It is also not possible to 
renounce them or otherwise deprive others of them. Both 
irrevocability and inalienability are unconditional. As long 
as human beings exist, they are endowed with human 
rights just as they are endowed with reason and conscience.
Nevertheless, the consequences of that statement were 
not clear to the drafters of the Virginian constitution, nor 
are they clear to many contemporaries. So, there is still a 
lot of people who have not noticed that the attributes of 
irrevocability and inalienability are not compatible with, 
for example, the death penalty or the torture of terrorists 
and criminals. We will return to this aspect later.
The Lockean approach again leads to the problem we 
have dealt with in the second lesson: human rights are 
norms and not facts. So, it is a kind of naturalistic fallacy 
to consider human rights natural attributes of human 
beings, like reason or conscience.
Nevertheless, we can interpret Locke in a way that 
avoids this naturalistic fallacy. We can justify human rights 
not as the result of divine creation of facts, but as the 
result of a divine legislation. By doing so, we could say 
that God is a legislator who can enact laws. In this case, we 
analogize the relation between God and human rights to 
the relation between the national parliament and the 
national laws that are enacted by the parliament.
Many critics argue against this construction on the 
grounds that it is based on a certain religious belief and 
that religious beliefs cannot be reasonably justifed. 
Religious foundations of human rights would lead to the 
result that atheists or believers of other religions could not 
be convinced and motivated to respect human rights.
God’s Legislation
52 Chapter 3 · The Social Contract Approach3
I think the question of whether religion can be justifed 
in a reasonable way is a very diffcult and debatable ques￾tion. Furthermore, I believe that religious justifcation of 
human rights is a matter of theology and not a matter of 
philosophy. This lecture is a philosophical one and not a 
theological one. Therefore, religious justifcation or foun￾dation is not our business.
Indeed, the question of religious truth is not really rel￾evant for our purposes. We can avoid this question simply 
by acknowledging that even if we are willing to take as a 
fact that God exists and that God issues laws for humans, 
we nevertheless do not have a stable basis and foundation 
for human rights by referring to the legislation of God. If 
we accept that God issues laws and demands that we 
should obey them, then the question arises why the laws of 
God should be valid and binding.
As we have seen in the last lesson, the threat of punish￾ment cannot provide a basis for the validity of laws. The 
only way to justify the validity of divine laws is to show 
that God is endowed with the legal competence to issue 
laws for humans. Nevertheless, God’s position as legislator 
must also be justifed. An adequate justifcation must con￾sist in showing that the legal competence to issue laws is 
conferred to God by someone who has a higher rank than 
God insofar as she has the legal competence to confer on 
God the authority of issuing laws for humans. The ques￾tion is not whether such a legislator of higher rank exists. 
The problem is rather that we are confronted with an inf￾nite regress because every legislator of whatever high rank 
so may only justifably issue laws and confer legal compe￾tences on another if there is a higher ranked agent who 
endows him with that very competence. This problem 
shows that the Lockean theory of social contract remains 
within the frame of the Aristotelian Approach and, there￾fore, is not really an appropriate alternative.
3.4 Jean-Jacques Rousseau
Now I want to continue to examine the different varia￾tions of social contract theories in order to fnd out their 
relevance for the foundation of human rights. I move to 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
Like with Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, we fnd in 
the theory of Jean-Jacques Rousseau the three elements of 
53

- Economic inequality

Solution:
- Legal equality
- Establishing a state as defender of equality
- Defense of equality through democratic procedures
. Fig. 3.4 Rousseau’s conception
every social contract theory: individualism, contractual 
autonomy, and a conception of the natural state.
The design of the natural state in Rousseau is quite dif￾ferent to those of Hobbes and Locke (see . Fig.  3.4). 
According to Rousseau, the natural state is the ideal state 
of freedom and happiness. There would be no motivation 
to escape from the natural state. He considers the natural 
state a situation where human individuals are living in 
small groups or families on the basis of love and affection. 
They are free and can live in accordance with their funda￾mental needs.
According to Rousseau, however, it is a historical fact 
that mankind has been driven out of the paradise of the 
natural state. They are now living in larger societies. The 
reason for this development was the introduction of agri￾culture and the system of private property of land. The 
phenomenon of property led to the formation of social 
structures that are no longer based on love and affection, 
but on economical expropriation. This leads to different 
social classes of possessors and of those who have nothing 
and must therefore serve the former.
Rousseau does not describe the natural state as a col￾lection of separate individuals without any social ties. 
Rather, he describes it as a social state marked by strong 
inequality. This is a very new aspect. Both Hobbes and 
Locke only conceived of individuals as having equal eco￾nomic and social positions. Both philosophers ignored the 
economic and social inequality of their time. They only 
had in mind the landowners and those who were econom￾ically independent. Rousseau, on the other hand, refects 
the huge inequality between the lower and upper classes 
during the time before the French Revolution. The strong 
inequality in Rousseau’s work not only addresses the 
dichotomy between economic dependency and indepen￾Inequality
54 Chapter 3 · The Social Contract Approach3
dency but also, as a result of this distinction, the huge 
inequality concerning the capacity for self-determination 
and autonomy.
The state of inequality is a state where the natural free￾dom of human beings is infringed. We can now ask 
whether Rousseau’s conception could be adequately 
described in terms of rights. In the natural state, there are 
no rights but only natural freedom. There was no right to 
freedom, but rather humane living conditions that were 
characterized through freedom. In the state of inequality, 
the living conditions are no longer humane. They are, so 
to say, not species-appropriate. Human beings suffer from 
this situation and Rousseau asks for means to improve 
their situation.
The social contract is the solution. According to 
Rousseau, the social contract serves the purpose of avoid￾ing social inequality. Inequality is the source of the 
infringement of freedom. The abolition of inequality 
leads, therefore, to the restoration of natural freedom.
Rousseau’s solution of the problem refers not to rights 
in the meaning of an absolute position of an obligee 
toward obligors, but rather as a matter of equalization of 
relative positions. Everybody should have the same social 
position in terms of access to freedom and benefts.
In the Rousseauian frame, rights are not conceived of 
as super-positive norms. Instead, rights are always consid￾ered positive norms issued by a public legislator. This 
becomes particularly clear by the example of the right to 
property. Unlike Locke, Rousseau considers the right to 
property not the permission to retain what the bearer of 
the right has taken as a possession, but a right to take pos￾session of what the state allocates. The citizen only has the 
right to equal allocation.
In principle, the same idea is applicable to the right to 
life. The difference is only that the right to property can be 
quantifed while the right to life cannot. So, if any member 
of society should have the right to life, everybody else 
should also have an equal right to life. If a member of 
society should not have the right to life—for example, 
because he is a murderer—then everybody else who is a 
murderer should also not have a right to life. In any case, 
rights are a question of equality and not a question of an 
absolute position.
Rousseau applies the same idea to the question of self￾determination, insofar as the social contract functions to 
abolish the domination of the strong over the weak. Every 
Volonté Générale
55
3.4 · Jean-Jacques Rousseau3
citizen should have equal infuence and power. The gov￾ernment shall be an assembly of the people, where every 
citizen has the same voice and the same vote. Oppression 
is avoided because laws and political decisions come about 
only by the consent of all citizens. The sum of the indi￾vidual wills (volonté de tous) becomes the general will of 
the society (volonté générale).
Justice and the protection of fundamental human 
interests, like the interest in life and freedom, are not guar￾anteed through rights, i.e., through the socially recognized 
and respected power to demand something from others, 
but through the procedure of making the volonté générale. 
The ultimate legitimization of rules is the procedure of 
democratic emergence of the public will. This view is still 
relevant today. A prominent contemporary representative 
of this doctrine is Jürgen Habermas.
The idea that human rights are simply a matter of 
equality and that equality can be guaranteed by demo￾cratic procedures of deliberation and legal or political 
decision making is not very convincing. The counter￾arguments are as follows:
1. Rousseau’s idea of adequate procedure demands una￾nimity. Modern democracies operate with majority￾votes. This involves the opportunity for the majority to 
disregard the fundamental human interests of the 
minority. On the other side, it is not practicable to 
demand unanimity because this would lead to a parlia￾ment’s inability to act.
2. Equality is no guarantee for the protection of funda￾mental human interests. It is possible that the majority 
of a society decides to avoid inequality by infringing 
certain fundamental interests. Let’s say that the major￾ity decides that every girl should be circumcised. So, 
equal treatment is guaranteed because every (female) 
person has to bear the same suffering. But it is obvious 
that female circumcision infringes a very basic human 
interest.
You may want to argue that Rousseau was one of the most 
prominent thought leaders of the French Revolution and 
that the French Revolution led to the French Declaration 
of the Rights of Man and Citizens of 1789, which encom￾passes more than just the right to equality (see . Fig. 3.5). 
Nevertheless, we must realize that the Declaration of 1789 
was not only infuenced by Rousseau, but also by the spirit 
Criticism
56 Chapter 3 · The Social Contract Approach3
. Fig. 3.5 French declaration of the rights of man and citizens
of the American Revolution. Its frst two articles show 
these two infuences.
Article 1 stresses the principle of equality. Article 2 
defnes the aim and function of the state, namely, to pre￾serve natural human rights. The catalogue of rights relates 
partly to Locke (liberty, property) and partly to Rousseau 
(security, resistance of oppression).
The Rousseauian infuence becomes clearer when we 
look at the mechanisms of the protection of rights. Until 
recently, it was not possible in France to appeal to the 
courts with regard to issues related to the protection of 
human rights. This was due to the idea that the democratic 
procedure of legislation already ensures that a violation of 
human rights cannot take place. Forensic rights protection 
was therefore considered superfuous.
3.5 John Rawls
Now I want to move to John Rawls. In the nineteenth cen￾tury and the frst half of the twentieth century, there was 
no discourse of the social contract theory in philosophy or 
legal theory. It was only John Rawls who revitalized this 
conception in 1971 with his book A Theory of Justice (see 
. Fig.  3.6). Since then, social contract theory is on the 
agenda again. As with any other social contract theory, we 
fnd in Rawls a foundation of the theory on the conditions 
of individualism and contractual autonomy. The differ￾ence to other theories again concerns the description of 
the natural state, which Rawls calls the original position.
Rawls does not start from lonesome, unbound indi￾viduals. His starting point is an existing society, i.e., a cer￾tain social structure of cooperation. But this society is 
characterized by injustice and inequality. For Rawls, this 
situation is not acceptable because cooperation is based 
57
3.5 · John Rawls3
. Fig. 3.6 Rawls’conception
on contributions of all the participating individuals and, 
accordingly, must have benefts for all participating indi￾viduals. The distribution of the benefts and burdens of 
cooperation must be fair. The challenge of his theory of 
justice is therefore determining the principles of a fair 
distribution of the benefts and burdens of cooperation. 
His conception is a one of distributive justice. Rights in 
this context are things that are distributed by society and 
not something the individuals holds before they come to 
society.
The distribution of benefts and burdens occurs equita￾bly when all members of society agree, or upon informed 
and rational thought would agree, with the principles of 
distribution.
In order to determine the fair principles of distribu￾tion, Rawls follows the so-called Maximin Principle. The 
idea behind this principle is that individuals must choose 
the principles of distribution under conditions of uncer￾tainty. They cannot calculate the probability of whether a 
certain principle of distribution will be advantageous or 
disadvantageous to them. For Rawls, individuals in the 
original position have a conservative, careful attitude 
toward unpredictable risks. Therefore, they will choose 
those principles of distribution which minimize the risks 
to them. That means they will prefer principles which 
guarantee them the best (maximum) of all bad (minimum) 
Maximin Principle
58 Chapter 3 · The Social Contract Approach3
possibilities. They will, in other words, choose a strategy 
of risk-minimalization.
A very important condition of the original position is 
that individuals have absolutely no idea about the chances 
that they will have in the constituted society to attain par￾ticular positions. They do not know their place in society; 
their class, position, and social status, their fortune in the 
distribution of natural assets and abilities, their strength, 
intelligence, etc. They also do not know about their own 
conceptions of good or their special psychological pro￾pensities. Rawls calls this situation a position behind a veil 
of ignorance. There are three principles that individuals 
would rationally choose behind the veil of ignorance:
1. The Liberty Principle. According to this principle, each 
person has an equal right to the most extensive basic 
liberty that is compatible with an equal liberty for oth￾ers. Unlike material goods, liberty is not a scarce 
resource. So, it is possible to distribute a maximum or 
optimum amount of liberty to each individual. The 
only limit to liberty is the equal liberty of each other. 
Rawls shares the opinion that this scope of liberty is 
flled with the political liberty to vote and run for offce, 
freedom of speech and assembly, liberty of conscience, 
freedom of personal property, and freedom from arbi￾trary arrest. So, the scope of equal liberty is more or 
less identical to the catalogue of the classic human 
rights.
2. The Difference Principle. The second principle of dis￾tribution they would choose is the principle according 
to which social and economic inequalities are to be 
arranged so that they are of the greatest beneft to the 
least advantaged members of society. Social or eco￾nomic resources and positions are scarce. It is not pos￾sible to provide each member of the society with an 
optimum amount of it. Inequalities are therefore 
unavoidable. Nevertheless, they are acceptable if they 
are arranged in a way that the least advantaged mem￾bers of society are in a better position than they would 
be the case in any other kind of distribution.
3. The Principle of Fair and Equal Access. The unequal 
distribution of social positions and economic goods is 
compatible with the equality of the members of society 
if every individual has an equal opportunity to attain 
privileged positions. The conditions of access must 
therefore be impartial and generally available.
Liberty Principle

Equal Access
59
3.5 · John Rawls3
For our purposes, we must take a closer look at the lib￾erty principle. First, we must recognize that the scope of lib￾erty which can be distributed equally is much broader than 
the scope of classical human rights. I will give you an exam￾ple from German case law. The freedom to ride in a public 
forest is obviously a freedom that can be distributed equally. 
But, the freedom to ride in a forest is not a human right.
Rawls shares the opinion that the principle of liberty is 
“lexically prior” to the difference principle. This thesis 
cannot be defended for every kind of exercise of liberty, 
e.g., not for the freedom to ride in the forest. It might be 
applicable to human rights insofar as they relate to funda￾mental human needs that no one would renounce regard￾less of whatever other advantages they could get in 
exchange for them. Rawls does not distinguish between 
liberty in the broadest sense and liberty in the sense of 
human rights.
Another very important aspect of Rawls’s conception 
is that his principles of justice are related to a particular 
society. You must frst be a member of that very society 
before you are entitled to vote for the relevant principles 
of justice and before you can be a partner of the social 
contract. This construction can only justify civil rights, 
but not human rights. It follows that Rawls’s conception 
of the social contract does not lead to a foundation of 
human rights because human rights refer to all human 
beings and not only to members of a particular society. 
This fact remains hidden because Rawls claims that the 
scope of liberty according to his liberty principle is exactly 
identical to the scope of human rights.
3.6 Why Social Contract Theories Cannot 
Serve as a Foundation for Human Rights
Having presented a brief overview of the major theories 
of social contract, I will show you once again why these 
theories are not suitable to provide a justifcation and 
foundation for human rights.
1. Socially unbound individuals cannot take over obliga￾tions. The classical conceptions of the natural state 
describe the inmates of that state as unbound, selfsh 
individuals without any social ties to each other. 
Rousseau assumes social ties that are based on love and 
liking. But he does not think about people who are not 
connected that way. From this starting point, it remains 
Criticism
Bound Before 
Contract
60 Chapter 3 · The Social Contract Approach3
an open question how such antisocial entities could 
ever make promises or enter contracts with people out￾side their scope of liking.
It might be possible to enter strategic agreements 
which are based on mutual egoistic interests, but such 
agreements can never establish a foundation of inalien￾able and irrevocable human rights. The rights that 
would follow from such a strategic agreement are 
always under the condition that they continue only to 
extent that the interests of the parties remain aligned. 
If one of the parties were to come to the insight that 
their private beneft could be larger if they were to can￾cel the agreement, then they would freely revoke it.
It is not enough to understand that there are no 
chains which bind the individual to the aims and pur￾poses of heteronomic authorities (God, nature). The 
absence of such heteronomic authorities might lead to 
the insight that human individuals are free. But it does 
not lead to the conviction that we are obliged to respect 
the freedom of others and to recognize and appreciate 
their autonomy. From this follows that the frst and 
fundamental obligation cannot be established by con￾tract. It must already exist before it is possible to agree 
to a contract. An individual who is not morally bound 
to anything is not capable of agreeing to a contract. 
The right to personal freedom must be recognized and 
respected before we can create systems of cooperation 
that are based on promises and contracts.
2. Contracts only establish bounds for the parties of the 
contract and not for persons outside the contractual 
ties. If a contract is the starting point of every kind of 
obligation, we cannot have obligations toward those 
who are not contracting parties. Even if they invite us 
to enter the contract with them, we are not obliged to 
comply.
It is not an objection to say that the social contract 
is not a real contract but only a thought experiment. 
The idea of a contract includes the idea of the freedom 
to choose whether or not the parties are willing to enter 
the contract. This aspect may not be ignored in a 
thought experiment concerning the idea of a contract.
3. Therefore, the conception of human rights based on a 
social contract must fail. That was exactly the reason 
why the conception of human rights, as it was devel￾oped in the philosophy of the Enlightenment and as it 
should be implemented as part of the American and

French revolution, has ultimately failed. Only the 
nationals of their own state were considered contract￾ing parties and it was possible to quit the contract with 
those who were considered to be an enemy or an anti￾social subject. Regarding those without citizenship, 
there was no feeling obliged to respect their human 
rights. They were considered aliens, i.e., people without 
rights. This attitude was evident in the practices of the 
CIA, bringing people without US citizenship to 
Guantanamo or other countries to torture them.
3.7 A New Approach After World War II
Only as a result of the horrible events during and after the 
Second World War did it become obvious that human 
individuals needed to be protected against the exclusion of 
any social tie and that it is fundamentally unjust to leave 
human individuals alone in the natural state. In particular, 
the experience of being a refugee and not enjoying any 
rights anywhere in the world led to the demand of the 
German Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt for “a Right 
to Rights”, i.e., a position of rights that are not only philo￾sophical ideas but also positions that are always connected 
with the right to be protected effectively by any state power 
regardless of the nationality or citizenship of the person.
As a result of these new ideas, the United Nations 
Organization, which was established in 1945 immediately 
after the war, was given the task of establishing an interna￾tional human rights regime in order to guarantee funda￾mental human rights for every person, independent of 
their citizenship and legal status. We will take a closer look 
at that regime in the next lesson.

The Human Dignity Approach
The human dignity approach is suggested by the texts 
of international human rights treaties. The preamble of 
the UN Charter of 26 June 1945 refers to “faith in fun￾damental rights, in the dignity and worth of the human 
person, in the equal rights of men and women.”
The preamble of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights (UDHR) of 10 December 1948 repeats 
this wording and adds a reference to the “recognition 
of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable 
rights of all members of the human family.”
Article 1 of the UDHR states that “all human 
beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” 
and adds that human beings are “endowed with reason 
and conscience.”
The preambles of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the International Cove￾nant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of 
16 December 1966, state that “the equal and inalienable 
rights of all members of the human family … derive 
from the inherent dignity of the human person.”
The Meaning of Human Dignity in International 
Human Rights Documents
There is no legal defnition of the term human dignity in 
international law.
The wording of the documents of 1945 and 1948 
combines the concepts of human rights, human dignity, 
equal rights for men and woman, as well as dignity and 
worth. The relationship between these concepts remains 
unclear.
The International Covenants of 1966 explain the 
relation between dignity and rights as a relationship of 
derivation.
A worldwide survey among philosophers and intel￾lectuals conducted in 1947 by the United Nations Edu￾cational, Scientifc and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) did not lead to a distinctive fnding. Opin￾ions about the concept “human dignity” as well as the 
term “human rights” were very confusing and diverse.
66 Chapter 4 · The Human Dignity Approach4
The Heteronomic Understanding of Human Dignity
In Cicero (de Offciis) and in many philosophers of the 
European Renaissance (Bartolomeo Facio, Gianozzo 
Manetti, etc.), human dignity was considered a particu￾lar status of human beings according to which they, in 
contrast to animals, hold a certain kind of “offce” and 
are therefore obliged to act in accordance with the rules 
of this “offce.” Human dignity refers therefore to 
duties and not to rights. In Germany, this approach was 
the prevailing one between the 1950s and 1990s.
This attitude still predominates in countries that are 
epitomized by Catholic culture, e.g., in France—where 
human dignity is considered the counter-concept to 
human rights. The function of human dignity is to 
restrict the range of human rights—examples include the 
dwarf tossing case and the justifcation of the burka ban.
The “Ensemble Theory” of Human Dignity
Within the English-speaking world, the prevailing idea is 
that human rights must be considered pure positive law. 
From this point of view, human dignity cannot be con￾sidered a principle from which human rights can be 
derived. Instead, human dignity is considered to be a 
certain rank or status that is defned by the sum of all the 
codifed human rights (Hilgendorf: human dignity = the 
ensemble of all human rights). Human dignity refers to 
the equal rank of every human being. It elevates, so to 
speak, all humans to the status of the nobility.
The Autonomic Understanding of Human Dignity
The autonomic conception of human dignity was frst 
formulated by the Italian philosopher Giovanni Pico 
Della Mirandola (1463–1494) in his work Oratio de Dig￾nitate Hominis (1486). Mirandola focuses on the ability 
of human beings to design their own lives according to 
their own free will. The freedom of will is what makes 
the difference between human beings and other entities. 
The dignity of man is founded in this freedom. This dig￾nity does not depend on the fulfllment of duties, but 
solely on the competence of human beings to manifest 
their own free will and design their own lives.
67
The Human Dignity Approach4
4.1 Human Dignity in International Law
In this chapter, I want to introduce the human dignity 
approach. I believe that this approach is the only one that 
is suited to provide a convincing foundation of human 
rights. Nevertheless, we must recognize that the concept of 
human dignity is very often very misunderstood.
This history of misunderstanding began with the dis￾cussion about the term in international human rights dis￾course. In the international law, human dignity is frst 
mentioned in the preamble to the Charter of the United 
Nations. Here it reads:
» We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save 
succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which 
twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to man￾kind, and to reaffrm faith in fundamental human rights, 
in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the 
equal rights of men and women and of nations large and 
small …
The wording alone, however, shows that the meaning of 
“dignity of the human person” was not entirely clear to 
the drafters of the Charter:
1. The expression “dignity and worth” is confusing. 
Obviously, it seems that dignity means something other 
than “worth.” But what is the difference between “dig￾nity” and “worth”? What is “dignity” when it is not a 
kind of “worth”?
2. What is the relationship between human rights and 
human dignity? Both are listed one behind the other 
and the list also embraces the “equal rights of men and 
women.” Are “human rights,” “human dignity,” and 
“equal rights” different things of the same category, so 
that they can be summarized in a list like apples, pears, 
and cherries can be summarized under the category of 
“fruits”? Is it possible to understand “human rights” as 
unequal rights in comparison with “equal rights”? Is 
“human dignity” the designation of a third sort of 
rights?
Another aspect is similarly confusing. The clause in ques￾tion was frst proposed by the South African Prime 
Minister Jan Christiaan Smuts (1870–1950). He criticized 
the frst draft of the preamble, which did not contain any 
reference to human dignity. He demanded a preamble that 
What is dignity?
Smuts
68 Chapter 4 · The Human Dignity Approach4
embraced a confession to the basic ideals of the coalition 
that fought against Hitler. Smuts believed that World War 
II was a war between different religions and that funda￾mental human rights, human dignity, and the equal rights 
of men and women were the core elements of the religious 
beliefs for which the Allied Forces fought.
Smuts’ draft didn’t contain the expression “dignity of 
the human person” but rather the expression “dignity of 
the human personality.” There was an intense dispute 
among the drafters of the Charter about this proposal and 
many of them proposed to replace “human personality” 
with “human being.” Finally, the drafters decided on the 
expression “human person.” This was a compromise 
because Smuts had strong objections against the expres￾sion “dignity of the human being.”
The reason for that objection was that Smuts did not 
share the idea that every human being is endowed with 
dignity or that dignity should ascribed to every human 
being. Dignity should only be ascribed to those who are 
considered personalities. The concept of personality 
should distinguish between different sorts of human 
beings. Smuts distinguished between white human beings 
and the sort of colored human beings. Dignity should be 
ascribed only to the white race and not to every human 
being.
While for Smuts the term dignity was an instrument of 
distinction between human beings, the majority of the 
drafters shared the opinion that dignity is something that 
should be ascribed to every human being and that there is 
no difference between human beings in terms of dignity. 
They considered the expression “human person” a syn￾onym of “human being.”
It is important to recognize that the preamble of the 
UN Charter uses the phrasing “to reaffrm faith in.” This 
expression shows that the drafters of the Charter shared 
the opinion that neither human rights nor the dignity of 
the human person nor the equal rights of men and women 
are something that can be established by law or treaty. The 
word “faith” was meant by Smuts as a religious term. 
Nevertheless, as we know, not every contracting party of 
the UNO was motivated by a particular kind of religious 
belief. In particular, the Soviet Union was expressly not a 
religious state. China at the time, and until 1971, was rep￾resented by the Kuomintang government, whose offcial 
ideology was also not infuenced by any particular reli￾69
4.1 · Human Dignity in International Law4
gious belief. Still, all contracting parties could accept the 
wording “reaffrm faith in.”
This shows that “faith” in the UN Charter may not be 
understood as religious belief of a particular kind. “Faith” 
simply means that each contracting party of the UN 
Charter shared the opinion that there are human values 
that should be regarded as the ethical basis of the new 
world organization. They also shared the opinion that 
these values can be embraced with the terms “human 
rights, dignity of the human person, and equal rights of 
men and women.”
Nevertheless, the idea of common values of humanity 
was not discussed in detail and the ideas that the states 
associated with the concept were very diffuse and differ￾ent. It is interesting that, in 1947, UNESCO found it per￾tinent to conduct a worldwide survey among philosophers 
and intellectuals about the foundation of human rights in 
order to prepare the drafting of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. The result was so confusing and diverse 
that UNESCO decided to keep the answers confdential in 
order to avoid unnecessary complications in the 
negotiations over the UDHR.
One of the answers came from Mohandas Karamchand 
“Mahatma” Ghandi. He held the opinion that rights can 
only emerge through the fulflment of obligations. So, for 
example, we would have the right to life only if we fulfll 
our duties as citizens of the world:
» The very right to live accrues to us only when we do the 
duty of citizenship of the world. From this one funda￾mental statement, perhaps it is easy enough to defne the 
duties of man and woman, and correlate every right to 
some corresponding duty to be frst performed. Every 
other right can be shown to be usurpation hardly worth 
fghting for.
That is precisely what many understand by human dignity. 
According to this understanding, the relation between 
human dignity and human rights is to be likened to the 
relation between duties and rights. Human dignity requires 
the fulflling of certain human duties. And those who suf￾fciently perform their duties are conferred certain rights. 
The rights describe the precise scope of freedom that is 
required in order to fulfll the duties.
This understanding of human dignity is very infuen￾tial in countries and cultures that are strongly epitomized 
Gandhi
70 Chapter 4 · The Human Dignity Approach4
by the spirit of Catholicism (Łuków, Hennette-Vauchez). 
Consider the following two examples from France.
1. The Wackenheim case: Mr. Wackenheim was small in 
stature. He earned his money by making himself avail￾able to be used as a missile in public performances 
where he was tossed as far as possible by strong, large 
men. This performance was called dwarf tossing. The 
police authorities issued a prohibition order against 
these performances and the Conseil d’Etat upheld it on 
the grounds that the performance violated human dig￾nity and was therefore contrary to the public order. 
There was a similar case in front of the German 
Verwaltungsgericht Neustadt.
2. When the French law concerning the ban of burkas 
and niqabs in public came before the ECourtHR, the 
French government defended the law, arguing that the 
complete concealment of the face violates human dig￾nity and that it was therefore necessary to prohibit this 
kind of clothing.
According to the French approach, it is incompatible 
with the obligations derived from human dignity for 
human beings to display themselves in public in a way that 
is considered degrading. According to this view, it is con￾trary to human dignity to display oneself as a human mis￾sile or as a human nobody. In both cases, people disregard 
the duty to appear in public in way that human dignity 
demands. In these cases, the state thus has the right to 
oppress and punish a behavior that is contrary to human 
dignity. Defending human dignity does not mean defend￾ing the real interest of human individuals, but rather 
defending dignity as a public and super-individual value.
4.2 The History of the Notion “Human 
Dignity”
This understanding of human dignity is very traditional. 
In fact, it is the oldest understanding of the concept. 
“Dignity” comes from the Latin notion dignitas, which 
expressed a certain difference in worth of particular per￾sonalities compared to the rest of mankind. In this origi￾nal meaning, the expression “human dignity” was rather 
senseless because the function of the notion was just to 
distinguish between different particular human individu￾Dwarf Tossing

als in terms of their social value and status. In the ancient 
language, one could only speak about the dignity of the 
nobles as compared to the commoners, the dignity of the 
king as compared to his subjects, the dignity of a judge as 
compared to other persons in court, etc. Only the Roman 
statesman and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–
43 BC) coined the notion “human dignity” in order to dis￾tinguish between human beings and animals. Cicero 
defended the idea that human beings have a higher rank 
than animals and that this rank comes with certain duties. 
Human individuals who disregard these duties degrade 
themselves to animal-like entities.
However, there was already another use of the term 
“dignitas” in antiquity. This is found in Lucius Annaeus 
Seneca (ca. 1–65). Here, dignity functions as a counter 
term to price. With these words, Seneca expresses a dis￾tinction that was characteristic of the philosophy of the 
Stoa since its beginning in Greece in the third century BC, 
namely the distinction between the one absolute good and 
the many relatively valuable goods. This use of language—
dignity as an opposite term to price—was adopted by 
Immanuel Kant. We will return to this in the next chapter 
(see 7 Sect. 5.2).
The term “human dignity” as defned by Cicero became 
very popular in the ffteenth century. Philosophers of the 
Italian Renaissance like Bartolomeo Facio, Gianozzo 
Manetti, and others started with the question of why God 
created human beings. The answer was: not because God 
requires humans in order to have servants or because there 
is any other need for him. God created man simply because 
of his pure goodness. Humans are therefore not means to 
any particular end. Rather, as Immanuel Kant later 
expressed, they are ends in themselves. Being an end in 
themself is what distinguishes humans from animals and 
every other non-human entity. Being an end in themself is 
the meaning of the term human dignity. Nevertheless, all 
these philosophers shared the traditional opinion that the 
social rank of human dignity comes from a source of spe￾cial human obligations, namely, the duty to subject one￾self under the rule of God and to follow his divine 
commandments. This traditional understanding of human 
dignity can be called the heteronomic one.
It is interesting to note that some contemporary phi￾losophers are still fxated on the idea that the notion “dig￾nity” refers to a certain rank or status. Accordingly, the 
American philosopher Jeremy Waldron defends the opin￾Seneca
Rebirth of human 
dignity
Ensemble Theory
72 Chapter 4 · The Human Dignity Approach4
ion that dignity originally refers to the extraordinary high 
rank and status of nobility as compared to the status of 
ordinary people. As a result of the French revolution, 
ordinary people were now considered elevated to the high 
rank of the nobility—they became equal in rank and sta￾tus with the nobility. According to this idea, human dig￾nity is defned by the sum of all the codifed human rights. 
The German legal philosopher Eric Hilgendorf speaks of 
human dignity as the ensemble of all the human rights 
(Ensemble Theory of Human Dignity). American philos￾ophers share this view because they do have no other way 
of understanding the meaning of human dignity, but only 
an understanding from a purely positivistic point of view. 
Nevertheless, in order to fnd an adequate foundation for 
human rights, this approach is fruitless. Waldron and 
Hilgendorf consider human dignity as being derived from 
the entirety of codifed human rights. Our interest is just 
the opposite. We do not want to derive the principle of 
human dignity from human rights. Instead, we search for 
the opportunity to derive human rights from the principle 
of human dignity.
The traditional heteronomic understanding of human 
dignity was challenged by the Italian philosopher Giovanni 
Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) in a famous writing 
that was published in 1486 under the title De Dignitate 
Hominis (“On the Dignity of Man”). Mirandola tells the 
story of the creation of man. God created man, took him 
in the middle of the world, and spoke to him:
» 18. We have given you, Adam, no fxed seat nor features 
proper to yourself nor endowment peculiar to you alone, 
in order that whatever seat, whatever features, whatever 
endowment you may responsibly desire, these same you 
may have and possess according to your desire and judg￾ment.
19. Once defned, the nature of all other beings, is con￾strained within the laws prescribed by us.
20. Constrained by no limits, you may determine it for 
yourself, according to your own free will, in whose hand 
we have placed you.
21. I have placed you at the world's center so that you may 
thence more easily look around at whatever is in the 
world.
Mirandola
73
4.2 · The History of the Notion “Human Dignity”4
22. We have made you neither of heaven nor of earth, 
neither mortal nor immortal, so that you may, as the free 
and extraordinary shaper of yourself, fashion yourself in 
the form you will prefer.
23. It will be in your power to degenerate into the lower 
forms of life, which are brutish; you shall have the power, 
according to your soul's judgment, to be reborn into the 
higher orders, which are divine.
Mirandolas’s idea was completely opposite of the tradi￾tional understanding. According to Mirandola, the dig￾nity of the human person does not refer to duties and 
obligations but to the competence to produce free will. We 
can call this conception of human dignity the autonomic
one.
Mirandola presented a completely new idea in tradi￾tional religious language. He was the frst philosopher to 
identify human dignity with the free will of human per￾sons. In contrast to former conceptions, how individuals 
use their capability to form a will was no longer relevant. 
It was not relevant to consider what individuals really 
want. The only thing that is relevant is the capacity to 
create one’s own free will. This becomes clear in the last 
paragraph of the cited text: Human individuals can 
decide to degenerate into lower forms of life, which are 
brutish, i.e., animal-like. Or they can decide to be reborn 
into the divine order. The dignity does not depend on the 
alternative which the individual chooses. Rather, the 
competence to decide is what makes the dignity of the 
individual.
In this meaning, human dignity has nothing to do with 
duties and obligations. Instead, it has to do with freedom, 
namely the freedom of will. At this point, I would like to 
draw your attention to the important distinction between 
freedom of will and freedom of action. I will return to 
that.
We must keep in mind that the alternative conceptions 
of human dignity—the understanding as obligation ver￾sus the understanding as freedom of will—were not dis￾cussed, perhaps not even clearly seen, by the drafters of 
the UN Charter or the drafters of the UDHR.  The 
UNESCO survey had shown that both conceptual worlds 
existed side by side and that there was no consensus on 
this issue. The concept of human dignity became the uni￾fying bond that played a central role in the drafting of the 
2 Conceptions
74 Chapter 4 · The Human Dignity Approach4
UDHR between late 1946 and December 1948, without 
the participants having a unifed understanding of what it 
should mean.
In any case, the drafters of the UDHR agreed that 
human rights should be understood as rights that are 
somehow closely related to human dignity. This is clear 
from the frst sentence of the preamble:
» Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the 
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human 
family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in 
the world …
as well as in the ffth paragraph,
» Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the 
Charter reaffrmed their faith in fundamental human 
rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person
and in Article 1:
» All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and 
should act towards one another in a spirit of brother￾hood.
Thus, throughout many sessions it was discussed how the 
connection between human dignity and human rights 
should be expressed. Nevertheless, the delegates could not 
agree on a formulation that brought both aspects together. 
Consequently, the notion of human dignity appears only 
in the preamble while the frst article adds some relevant 
aspects to it.
The term dignity appears in the preamble twice. The 
ffth paragraph is insofar a repetition of the formula in the 
UN Charter. The frst paragraph does not speak of the 
dignity of the human person anymore, but replaces this 
expression with the expression all members of the human
family. This wording was chosen in order to make clear 
that dignity is not something that can only ascribed to cer￾tain parts of mankind. Members of the human family are 
individuals and every human individual should be consid￾ered someone to whom dignity should be ascribed.
Article 1 of the UDHR shows the reasons why human 
dignity should be ascribed to every human individual: 
every human is endowed with reason and conscience. What 
in Mirandola was expressed with the words “free will” is 
here described as “reason and conscience.” Nevertheless, 
one question remained unclarifed: is it true that every 
UDHR
75
4.2 · The History of the Notion “Human Dignity”4
member of the human family, i.e. every human individual, 
is endowed with reason and conscience? This question sur￾faced for the frst time in the context of modern bio-tech￾nology. The drafters of the UDHR were not aware that 
there could be a difference between “human persons” and 
“every member of the human family” because individuals 
are not persons when they are not endowed with reason 
and conscience. We will come back to this point later.
Another very interesting point of Article 1 of the UDHR 
refers to something that is not written. It appears only when 
we compare the text to the very similar wording found in 
Section 1 of the Virginia Bill of Rights of 12 June 1776.
» That all men are by nature equally free and independent 
and have certain inherent rights.
There, we read that all men are equally free and indepen￾dent and that they have certain rights. This is very similar 
to the wording in Article 1 of the UDHR which provides 
that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity 
and rights. The key difference is that the words “by nature” 
in the Virginian Constitution do not appear in the 
UDHR. One could think that the phrase “by nature” is 
synonymous with “are born”. But there was a long debate 
among the drafting committee of the UDHR about 
whether it should be said that human individuals are 
endowed with reason and conscience by nature. Some del￾egations argued for the expression “by God” (Brazil). 
Ultimately, the conference could not agree on a common 
metaphysical preunderstanding and the words “by nature” 
were simply deleted.
It is interesting to recognize that from the viewpoint of 
the drafters, on the one hand, “human dignity” obviously 
refers to a certain metaphysical understanding while, on 
the other hand, that metaphysical preunderstanding was to 
remain open. In other words, the question about the foun￾dation of human rights was put forward to philosophy.
Fortunately, however, the third step of development in 
the codifcation of international human rights succeeded 
in further clarifying the relationship between human dig￾nity and human rights. The International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of 16 
December 1966, state in their preambles that the inherent 
dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all mem￾bers of the human family were not only the foundation of 
freedom, justice, and peace in the world, but also that 
ICPPR/ICESCR
76 Chapter 4 · The Human Dignity Approach“these rights [are] derive[d] from the inherent dignity of 
the human person.”
With this wording the relationship between dignity and 
rights was clarifed insofar as it was shown that human 
dignity is considered the basis from which human rights 
can be derived. Human dignity is therefore not a right 
itself. It is something different from rights. It is the princi￾ple on which rights are based.
As the result of what we have learned in this chapter we 
can conclude the following:
1. According to the understanding of the international 
human rights instruments, human rights are a set of 
rights that are not established by law or treaty, but 
rather are the precondition of law and treaty. Thus, the 
codifcation of human rights is not to be considered a 
kind of creation, but rather a kind of recognition.
2. Human rights are based on a common principle that is 
called the principle of human dignity. The human 
rights can be derived from the principle of human dig￾nity. Human dignity is considered something that must 
be ascribed to every member of the human family or, 
perhaps at least, to every human person.
3. The idea of human dignity is not clarifed in interna￾tional law. There is no legal defnition. Nevertheless, 
the fact that international law considers human dignity 
the source of human rights—as opposed to human 
duties—suggests that the concept should be under￾stood in the autonomist sense.
4. So, it is the task of the human rights courts to clarify 
the concept. But it seems that the courts cannot achieve 
this task without very deep und careful philosophical 
refection. This is what we shall do in the next lesson.
?Do you Still Remember?
1. What was the original understanding of dignity?
2. There is a heteronomic as well as an autonomic under￾standing of human dignity. Which of these under￾standings form the basis of the decisions in the 
so-called dwarf tossing cases?
3. What are the crucial criteria of the heteronomic under￾standing of human dignity?
4. What are the crucial criteria of the autonomic under￾standing of human dignity?
For the answers, see Chap. 7 21.

Etymology of “Dignity”
“Dignity” goes back to the Latin word “dignitas.” Dig￾nitas stems from the Indo-Germanic root “dek,” which 
means to accept something, to adopt something, to 
prefer something.
The German translation of dignitas is “Würde.” 
This word stems from the Old High German root 
“wīrtī” = Wert, worth, value.
From the etymology follows that dignity does not 
refer to an attribute of an entity out in the world but to 
an act of evaluation.
Value Judgments
Acts of evaluation result in a value judgment. Value 
judgments have the form “X is (considered) valuable” 
or “X is (considered) good” or “X is (considered) wor￾thy.”
The abstract structure of value judgments is as fol￾lows:
5 p prefers x compared to y on the basis of value stan￾dard v.
In contrast to assertoric propositions (“Beijing is the 
capital of China”), value judgments do not tell us 
something about facts. They are therefore neither true 
nor false. They are statements by a person concerning 
certain facts which tell us something about the attitudes 
of the person who delivers the statement. Value judg￾ments are either valid or invalid. Their validity depends 
on whether there is a person who delivers judgment or 
at least agrees with it.
This understanding of value judgments corre￾sponds to the so-called subjective value theory or value 
subjectivism (Mackie, von Wright). Many philosophers 
(McNaughton, Putnam) contest this theory and defend 
instead an objective value theory or value realism. Value 
realists believe that values are part of the objective 
world (“world inventory”) and are therefore a matter of 
facts. Objective value theories are modern variants of 
the ancient Greek cosmos theory.
80 Chapter 5 · The Human Dignity Principle I5
Standards of Evaluation
Value judgments are only comprehensible if they indi￾cate a standard of evaluation. That is the value scale on 
which the evaluation is oriented. A value judgment 
without the indication of a standard of evaluation is to 
be considered irrational.
The Categories of Values
Immanuel Kant distinguishes two different categories 
of value: relative value (price) and absolute value (dig￾nity). He further distinguished between two sub-cate￾gories of price: Intrinsic value (fancy price) and 
extrinsic value (market price). The criterion of distinc￾tion is the standard of evaluation (value scale):
5 Intrinsic value—value scale: love, liking.
5 Extrinsic value—value scale: exchangeability (supply 
and demand).
5 Absolute value—value scale: “that which constitutes 
the condition under which alone anything can be an 
end in itself.” This is—deviating from Kant—the 
personhood.
Personhood
Personhood consists of the self-awareness that “I am” 
as well as the self-awareness of “who I am” (personal 
identity). The awareness of “who I am” is an individu￾al’s consciousness of being the author of one’s own will 
and therefore the source and ultimate reference point 
of all their evaluations. Having this awareness makes an 
individual more than just a device or instrument in the 
hand of others, or a mere object of nature. The aware￾ness of “who I am” can also be called the awareness of 
one’s own authenticity or the awareness of being some￾one and not just something. Living entities who have 
this awareness are called persons.
81
The Human Dignity Principle I5
Absolute Value of Personhood
Personhood is valuable in the most absolute sense to 
every person because it is the required condition of any 
other evaluation. Any other object can only be consid￾ered valuable because it is valuable for that person by 
virtue of her personhood. The awareness of person￾hood (authenticity) is the source of all self-esteem.
Only Individual Persons as “Bearers” of Dignity
Persons are the only entities to whom we can assign 
absolute value because only persons, or at least poten￾tial persons, are endowed with the capacity to manifest 
free will on the basis of their own considerations and 
refections.
Theoretically, non-human persons to whom we can 
assign dignity are conceivable. On the other hand, not 
every member of the human family is endowed with 
personal identity or at least with the potential to 
develop personal identity (e.g., anencephalous human 
babies). Therefore, we cannot ascribe dignity to every 
member of the human family, but only to those who are 
persons or potential persons. Human dignity refers to 
the dignity of the human person.
Me-Dignity
Every person assigns herself dignity (“me-dignity”) 
because the capacity to be the author of one’s own free 
will has absolute value for every person. But the fact 
that every person may assign herself dignity does not 
lead to the universal value of human dignity. Human 
dignity, as a universal value, demands that every person 
not only ascribe dignity to herself, but also to every 
other person in the world.
82 Chapter 5 · The Human Dignity Principle I5
The Generality of Human Dignity
The personhood of every person in the world can be an 
absolute value for person P only if the personhood of 
every other person is a necessary condition for person P 
to develop and maintain respect for their own person￾hood. Therefore, the personhood of other persons can 
be an absolute value for person P only if P’s own per￾sonhood and the personhood of every other person are 
equiprimordial.
Equiprimordiality refers to the existence of two 
entities that depend on each other because the frst 
entity is a required condition of the second and the sec￾ond entity is a required condition of the frst. They are 
like the two sides of the same coin. Either both of them 
exist or neither do.
The Equiprimordiality Thesis
Whether there is equiprimordial connectivity between 
the awareness of one’s own personhood and the aware￾ness and recognition of the personhood of any other 
person cannot be answered through pure philosophical 
means. The answer demands not only an analysis of 
language but some knowledge about the natural condi￾tions of human life and its development. Therefore, 
only the empirical sciences can deliver an adequate 
answer.
[Some philosophers considered the equiprimordial￾ity thesis to be a matter of pure philosophy that can be 
answered through transcendental arguments. Examples 
of such philosophical trials are the frst chapter of 
Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s Foundation of Natural Law
and the chapter “Master and Slave” in Georg Friedrich 
Hegel’s book Phenomenology of Spirit, 1807.]
Therefore, we have to formulate an empirical 
hypothesis that can be examined by means of the 
empirical sciences. This hypothesis is thus: The authen￾ticity of any person and the authenticity of any other 
person are equiprimordial.
83
The Human Dignity Principle I5
5.1 Dignity as a Value Judgment
In this chapter, we move to the core substance of the lec￾ture. It is very important to understand the particular 
steps of my argumentation that I am introducing here. 
Only a suffcient understanding of this argumentation 
allows you to understand what human rights are and 
which criteria we must observe to address whether we 
must consider a certain demand to be a human right. The 
frst question we have to ask is: What is dignity?
A very good beginning of any explication of concepts 
is a view on the etymology of the word. The English word 
dignity comes from the Latin word dignitas, which comes 
from the Indo-Germanic root “dek.” Dek means to accept 
something, to adopt something, or to prefer something.
Thus, dignity is not an expression that indicates a fact 
out in the world or a collection of facts. It is also not what 
we call a sortal. A sortal is a noun that serves the purpose 
of classifying single entities by counting individuals of the 
same sort. “Dignity” refers neither to individual entities 
nor to classes of individuals. Instead, it expresses a value 
judgment. This value judgement says the following: The 
Human Being is Valuable.
As you will recall, the instruments of international 
human rights do not talk about “human dignity,” but 
about “dignity of the human person” or “dignity of all 
members of the human family.”
As I mentioned before, there is a difference between 
“member of the human family”—which may be equated 
to “human being”—and human person. Nevertheless, at 
this stage of my argumentation, we do not have to ask for 
the object to which we may assign dignity. Rather, we are 
questioning what is meant by dignity. Therefore, we may at 
this time leave open the question about the object of the 
evaluation. What is more relevant here is the question 
about what value judgments really are.
Value judgments in general have a certain structure. 
We can display that structure in the following way:
5 p prefers x compared with y on the basis of the value 
standard v
We must frst distinguish between assertoric propositions 
and value judgements. The sentence “Beijing is the capital 
of China” is an assertoric one. It is either true or false. The 
sentence is true if Beijing is the capital of China. Otherwise, 
Etymology
Value Judgment
Truth and Validity
What is dignity?
84 Chapter 5 · The Human Dignity Principle I5
it is false. In any case, its truth or falsity does not depend 
on the person who asserts this proposition. In compari￾son, value judgments do not refer to the objective reality. 
They instead express a certain position or statement of a 
particular person that relate to reality or aspects of reality. 
Therefore, value judgments are neither true nor false. They 
are valid or invalid, and their validity depends on whether 
there is someone who agrees with that judgment. In con￾trast to truth in assertoric propositions, the validity of 
value judgments depends on the person who identifes 
with it. A value judgment is valid only if there is at least 
one person who delivers it or who agrees with it.
It makes sense to use the notions of truth and validity 
as possible attributes of assertoric or value judgements, 
but not as possible attributes of entities beyond the lan￾guage, i.e., in the outer world. Assertoric propositions can 
have the attribute of being either true or false. Value judg￾ments can have the attribute of either being valid or 
invalid.
You may fnd additional information about the charac￾teristic of value judgments in von Wright and Urmson. It 
is very useful to follow the proposed distinction between 
truth and validity because it always clarifes the difference 
between assertoric propositions and value judgments and 
avoids confusion and misunderstanding. In our ordinary 
language, we do not carry out this distinction and, for this 
inaccuracy, we harvest much uncertainty in our thinking.
This risk also occurs if we do not distinguish between 
value judgements themselves and secondary reports about 
value judgements. When a person makes such a report, the 
person only asserts a piece of information which can either 
be true or false. For example, if I say, “Peter prefers 
Monica out of all girls in the classroom,” I am expressing 
an assertoric proposition. This is different from what I 
understand when Peter expresses to me that he has a pref￾erence for Monica. In this case, I become a witness of a 
certain kind of performance, namely the delivering of a 
value judgment. Value judgments in this sense are perfor￾mative actions in the meaning of John L. Austin. The gen￾eral structure of a value judgment shows some variables 
that require further clarifcation.
So, who is p? P is the one who puts forth the value 
judgment by showing his own preference for a certain 
object.
85
5.1 · Dignity as a Value Judgment5
The variables x and y do not need any further com￾ment. X is the object of the evaluation and y makes clear 
what preference is meant with regard to the particular 
context. Preferences are always based on a comparison 
between concurring objects. Y is the object of comparison 
with x.
But what of the variable v? V is a standard or unit of 
measurement that makes the value judgment rationally 
comprehensible or understandable. Such standards are in 
fact values of a higher level of abstraction.
Take the following example. Someone says, “This com￾puter is good.” This sentence is not very comprehensible 
or understandable. We cannot understand why and to 
what extent the computer is considered to be good. We can 
ask, “Why do you think that this computer is good?” And 
the answer could be, “This computer is good because it is 
stable.” This sentence is a comprehensible value judgment 
because we now know the relevant standard of measure￾ment—stability. Perhaps someone else would say, “No. 
This computer is not good. This other one is good because 
it is faster.” Nevertheless, there is no contradiction between 
these two value judgments. The former is based on a sta￾bility standard while the latter is based on a processing 
speed standard. Obviously, the persons who deliver these 
two different value judgments have different interests 
when it comes to the evaluation of computers.
Very often, people deliver value judgments without any 
reference to a value standard. But those judgments are 
irrational and it does not make any sense to try to under￾stand them. For value judgments to be comprehensible, we 
must know on which value standard they are based.
Now let us apply the structure of value judgments to 
the dignity judgment about human beings. The frst ques￾tion is who p is in this situation. The validity of the human 
dignity judgment depends on our individual statements or 
attitudes. If we think human beings have dignity, then they 
have it; if we do not think they do, then they do not. Thus, 
the answer depends on our personal statements and posi￾tions. It is not possible to demonstrate the dignity of the 
human being or of the human person to those who do not 
share the same position. Indeed, there are many people 
who do not share it. I will come back to this point later. A

least the most politically infuential part of the popula￾tion, agree with dignity-judgement concerning human

86 Chapter 5 · The Human Dignity Principle I5
beings. People and states who do not agree with that judg￾ment are not wrong in their perception of reality. Our 
point of view leads us to think that they prefer a different 
and wrong way of life. We think that sharing the dignity￾judgement would be a way to a better life for them. This is 
why we will try to convince them of the value of human 
dignity. To convince someone of the value of human dig￾nity is not merely an intellectual challenge. It does not 
require intellectual or philosophical arguments, but rather 
the particular kind of experience with other persons that 
helps establish a new and different relationship to this 
other person: a particular relationship of self-esteem. I 
will come back to this problem in the next lesson.
The next question is what x is in the human dignity 
judgement. X is the object of evaluation, in our case “the 
human being.” But what exactly is meant by “human 
being”? Is it every single human individual (every member 
of the human family)? Is it only a personal human indi￾vidual (every human person)? Is it only those personal 
human individuals with “personality” (the idea of 
Smuts)—i.e., what we call a “Gentleman” or a very serious 
or reliable person? Is it an idea of humanity? Is it mankind 
as such, the human species? At this point, we are unable to 
answer this question. But I promise to answer it later.
What is y? We cannot know what entity we are to com￾pare human beings to without frst knowing what is meant 
by human being. So at the moment we must also leave this 
question open.
What is v? This question refers to the value standard 
that underlies our dignity-judgment about human beings. 
At this stage of my argumentation, the difference between 
value and dignity becomes relevant. What is the relation￾ship between value and dignity?
5.2 Dignity as a Specifc Category of Value
Dignity is a kind of value. Value is a generic term, while 
dignity is one of the specifc terms of value (see . Fig. 5.1). 
The difference between the different kinds of value is 
based on the different categories of value standards. So, it 
is necessary to determine the particular category of value 
standard that underlies the particular kind of value that 
we call dignity.
There are two different categories of value. According 
to Maximilian Forschner, the subdivision of the term 
87
5.2 · Dignity as a Specifc Category of Value5
. Fig. 5.1 The specifc terms and sub-terms of the term “value”. 
(© Paul Tiedemann)
value in these two different categories goes back to the 
ancient European philosophy of the Stoa. The Stoa distin￾guished between the categories of price (axía) and what is 
today called dignity (axíoma). Nowadays, the locus clas￾sicus of that distinction is a spot in Immanuel Kants frst 
book on moral philosophy, Foundations of the Metaphysics 
of Morals (1786). Here we read:
» In the kingdom of ends everything has either price or dig￾nity. Whatever has a price can be replaced by something 
else which is equivalent; whatever, on the other hand, is 
above all prices, and therefore admits of no equivalent, 
has a dignity. Whatever has reference to the general incli￾nations and wants of mankind has a market price; what￾ever, without presupposing a want, corresponds to a 
certain taste, that is to a satisfaction in the mere purpose￾less play of our faculties, has a fancy price; but that which 
constitutes the condition under which alone anything can 
be an end in itself, this has not merely a relative worth, 
i.e., price, but an inner worth, that is dignity.
Kant distinguishes between the two different categories of 
value: price and dignity. We can express this distinction in 
terms of relative and absolute value. In the category of 
relative value, he further sets out two subcategories: the 
fancy price and the market price. We can express this dis￾tinction in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic value.
We are used to dealing with extrinsic and intrinsic val￾ues in our everyday life. We are very familiar with them. In 
88 Chapter 5 · The Human Dignity Principle I5
order to determine the value standard of dignity it might 
therefore be useful to frst clear up the value standards of 
the market and the fancy prices. From there, we can try to 
come closer to the value standard of dignity.
Something has a fancy price if we are interested in it as 
such. If we are interested in something as such, we love it 
or we like it. So, the value standard of the fancy price is 
love or liking.
Nevertheless, we are not just interested in only one 
thing or event or whatever. Sometimes, we can only attain 
something that we like if we renounce something else in 
which we also have a similar interest. In such a situation, 
we must decide what we prefer. We tend to prefer things 
that we love more than others. All the subjects of our 
desire are situated in a preference order and this order tells 
us what we are supposed to prefer in a particular situation. 
Therefore, all the things we love are related to each other 
within the framework of a preference order.
Take the example of a stamp collector. He desires 
stamps. He does not want to use them to send letters or 
postcards. He puts them in his stamp collection book and 
is simply happy to own them or perhaps he simply enjoys 
the aesthetic of stamps. Stamps, or a particular sort of 
stamps, have a fancy price for him.
Something has a market price if we are not interested 
in it as such but only in something else which we can 
exchange for it. So, the market price of something is 
always relative to something else that we actually want. 
The value standard of the market price is the relation 
between supply and demand—or in other words, the 
exchangeability.
Take the example of a pen pal. She desires stamps like 
the stamp collector does. But she is not interested in the 
stamps as they are, she needs them to send letters to her 
pen pal. So, she exchanges the stamps for being able to 
send her letter to the address of the pen pal. By these two 
examples you can determine that a stamp having a fancy 
price or a market price does not depend on the stamp. The 
price of the stamp is not an attribute of the stamp itself 
but a certain attitude of the stamp collector or the pen pal.
I think this knowledge about the characteristic of 
prices and about the two subcategories of prices can help 
us understand the meaning of dignity. Dignity is the oppo￾site of prices. It does not refer to a relative value but to the 
opposite of relative. The opposite of relative is absolute. 
Dignity means an absolute value. Absolute means that this

5.2 · Dignity as a Specifc Category of Value5
value is free from any relation to ordinary intrinsic or even 
extrinsic values, which means that it is not integrated into 
any preference order, but exists beyond and independent 
of any possible preference order. Something has absolute 
value if there is nothing else in the world that could be 
worth preferring or exchanging for it. Therefore, some￾thing has dignity if it is more important in the absolute 
sense than every other valuable entity (things, relation￾ships, situations, positions, etc.). It is not possible to 
renounce entities that have dignity nor is it possible to bal￾ance them or to prefer things that do not have dignity over 
things that do. But the question remains: What is the value 
standard of dignity?
5.3 Personhood as the Value Standard 
of Dignity
The value standard of dignity is, of course, not exchange￾ability, because dignity is the opposite of market price and 
exchangeability is the value standard of the market price. 
Furthermore, pure love and liking also cannot be the value 
standard of dignity because these form the value standard 
of the fancy price. So, is there anything that can function 
as the value standard for absolute values? It must be 
something that always trumps every other valuable entity 
in every situation such that it is unavoidably preferable in 
every situation. Is such a thing imaginable? Many philoso￾phers hold the opinion that such a value standard does not 
exist. For them, values are always relative. They claim that 
everything has a price. There is no such thing as an abso￾lute value.
I want to prove this skepticism incorrect. There is 
indeed something that logically has an absolute value and 
can function as the value standard of dignity. This is what 
we call personhood or personal identity. What exchange￾ability is to the category of market prices, what love is to 
the category of fancy prices, is personhood is to the cate￾gory of dignity.
What is personhood? It is composed of two aspects:
1. The awareness that I am (the awareness of my pure 
existence), and
2. The awareness of who I am.
90 Chapter 5 · The Human Dignity Principle I5
Awareness of who I am does not refer to my name, lineage, 
social status, or the like. Rather, it refers to knowing that I 
am a person, a somebody, and not just a something. The 
consciousness of being a person is given with the con￾sciousness of being the author of my own will. I am a per￾son insofar as I am aware of having emerged from a 
lifelong continuous stream of actions that I attribute to 
myself and through which I have become who I am. I am 
thus created and transformed by my will, which manifests 
itself in actions. Because I conceive of myself as a person, 
that is, as the embodiment of my past, present and future 
actions, I cannot conceive of myself as a thing or as a mere 
object that can be found in the world. Rather, for me, I am 
my will manifested in actions. This awareness of myself as 
a person can therefore also be called personal identity 
or—emphasizing the origin of my will and my actions—
authenticity.
I use these three expressions (personhood, personal 
identity, authenticity) interchangeably. A lack of authen￾ticity can confuse or destroy our personal identity, because 
in such a situation we are unable to understand ourselves 
as the originators of our will, and are instead forced to 
conceive of ourselves as mere objects responding to the 
laws of nature, or as mere instruments or devices in the 
hands of others. We thereby become an object that can 
observe itself. As a person, i.e., as the origin of will, on the 
other hand, we cannot observe ourselves. As persons, we 
are always already ahead of any observation.
It is not only necessary to know what personal identity 
is, we must also clear up why personhood is supposed to 
be so important that we can say it has absolute value. 
Personhood has absolute value because the awareness of 
being the author of our own will gives us the conscious￾ness of being the ultimate point of reference for any evalu￾ation—that is, to be an entity whose value is beyond any 
other value because it is the source of all other values. We 
can and must ascribe an absolute value to ourselves as per￾sons, because as persons we are the source of all (relative) 
values. This is the basis of any true sense of self-worth. If 
we did not assign an absolute value to ourselves, every￾thing else would lose all (relative) value for us. As long as 
anything in life is important to us, we must inevitably give 
ourselves absolute importance.
Personhood as 
Absolute Value
91
5.3 · Personhood as the Value Standard of Dignity5
One can understand the absolute value of personhood 
with the following: if personhood only had relative value, 
then there is a conceivable situation where any x would be 
more valuable for a person than their own personhood. If 
x is more valuable than one’s personhood, it would be rea￾sonable in the event of such a confict to renounce person￾hood in order to attain x. But giving up personhood means 
giving up the ability to manifest one’s own will. 
Nevertheless, without the ability to produce one’s own 
will, everything including x loses its value, for values are 
the result of our will-making. Without the capacity to pro￾duce one’s own will, nothing can have any value. 
Personhood is a prerequisite for the possibility of any 
evaluation and, therefore, a required condition of the pos￾sibility of any and all value.
At this stage of the lesson, we can conclude that there 
are three different categories of value that can be distin￾guished through their different value standards, that dig￾nity is one of these categories, and that it is defned by the 
value standard of personal identity.
Now we come to the evaluation of human beings. 
What is the value of a human being? As such or by nature, 
human beings as living entities are simply facts—and facts, 
by nature, have no value. For values are not part of the 
world inventory. They exist only as the result of subjective 
acts of evaluation. It is up to us whether we assign a cer￾tain value to human beings.
Like every other object, human beings can also be 
assigned an extrinsic value (market price). We always do as 
much when we hire a worker, elect a politician, or listen to 
a lecturer. The worker has a market price for the employer. 
He is interested in the work of the worker and the worker, 
or the lecturer, can be replaced by another, better worker/
lecturer, or even a robot. The market price of a worker is 
expressed in his wage; the market price of a lecturer can be 
expressed by his amount of royalties or academic awards.
Like every other object, human beings can also be 
assigned an intrinsic value (fancy price). We always do as 
much when we regard someone as our friend or when we 
love our children. In such cases, our friend or our children 
have a value as such for us. Nevertheless, the rank of this 
value can only be identifed in the frame of a preference 
order. Indeed, some may be willing to neglect their chil￾dren in order to improve their career or rescue their stamp 
collection.
Value of Humans
92 Chapter 5 · The Human Dignity Principle I5
But what is about dignity? It is not possible to assign 
dignity to every object. Only those objects that are 
endowed with personhood, or at least with the potential 
for personhood, may be considered as possible candidates 
for assigning dignity. At this step, we can thus recognize 
that it is not possible to assign dignity to mere material 
things or animals and plants or even to mankind, groups 
of human beings, societies, states, the idealistic idea of a 
“true” human being, and so on.
Furthermore, it is not possible to assign dignity to 
every human individual—i.e., to every specimen of the 
human species. For not every specimen of the human spe￾cies has, at the very least, the potential to develop personal 
identity. Possible objects for assigning dignity can only be 
human individuals that are capable of developing their 
own free will. We call such individuals “persons.” 
Nevertheless, by defnition, persons do not necessarily 
need to be human. It is theoretically possible that there are 
non-human persons. The only possible objects that we 
may assign dignity to are persons, regardless of whether 
they are humans. Still, as of now, we do not know of any 
other species except for the human species that can emerge 
as persons. This is why in most contexts it does not make 
any practical difference whether we talk about human dig￾nity or personal dignity. But if we want to talk correctly, 
we must assert that there is no dignity of the human being 
but only dignity of the human person.
If we consider human beings as things that have extrin￾sic or intrinsic values, we have to recognize that it is not 
possible to assign these kinds of values to every human 
being—or, at least, to every human person—at the same 
time. There are always only some human beings that we 
consider as having extrinsic or intrinsic value for us. We 
are not interested in hiring all mankind as workers and we 
do not love every person in the world as we love our own 
children. On the contrary, the idea of human dignity can 
serve as the foundation of human rights only if it is pos￾sible to assign dignity to every human person in the world 
regardless of whether we know them or whether we have a 
relationship with them and regardless of the quality of a 
given relationship. Only under this condition is it possible 
to establish human rights as general rights—i.e., as rights 
of every human person. But how is it possible to assign 
dignity to every human person in the world?
93
5.3 · Personhood as the Value Standard of Dignity5
5.4 “Me-Dignity” and General Human 
Dignity
I want to start with the most familiar person I know. That 
is myself. I am aware of myself as the author of my will 
and I appreciate this authenticity in the absolute sense 
because it allows me to understand myself as someone and 
not only as something. Consequently, I know that there is 
at least one human being to whom I can assign dignity, 
which is myself. I hope you can do the same for yourself. 
But if I am talking about my dignity and if you are talking 
about your dignity, we are not talking about human dig￾nity but only about what I call “me-dignity.” The sum of 
“me-dignity” does not make for general human dignity. I 
can only talk about human dignity if I can assign dignity 
not only to myself, but also to every other human person. 
I can assign dignity to every other person only if two con￾ditions are met:
1. I must understand other persons as authors of their 
own will. This condition is not problematic. We have 
always assumed that other people are also persons. 
Otherwise, forms of communication such as thanking 
and reprimanding would make no sense.
2. I must regard the personhood of others as absolutely 
valuable, just like I regard my own personhood as abso￾lutely valuable. The reason why I regard my own 
authenticity as absolute is because it is a required con￾dition for the possibility of my being aware of myself 
as someone and not just as something. Therefore, I can 
regard the authenticity of others as absolute valuable 
only if the authenticity of others is the same way and 
with the same infuence a required condition of my self￾awareness of being someone and not just something.
At this point, the philosophical argumentation about the 
concept of human dignity has come to an end. From a 
pure philosophical standpoint, there is nothing more to 
say. The concept of human dignity has been linguistically 
and philosophically analyzed.
Let us summarize the results. The concept of human 
dignity refers to an absolute value judgment. The only 
thing that can and must be considered absolutely valuable 
is personal authenticity (personhood). The philosophical 
analysis shows that it is not possible to consider one’s own 
personhood anything but absolutely valuable. The philo￾Generalization
94 Chapter 5 · The Human Dignity Principle I5
sophical evidence for this is a transcendental argument. 
The absolute value of one’s own personhood is the condi￾tion of the possibility of any evaluation, whatever kind.
Philosophy can also teach us that the personal authen￾ticity of others can only be an absolute value for me if the 
personal authenticity of others is exactly the same way as 
my own personal authenticity the basis of my self￾awareness as someone and not just as something. 
Unfortunately, however, it is not possible to set out tran￾scendental arguments for the fact that our self-recognition 
as persons depends on the recognition of other persons as 
persons. Therefore, there can only be one way to deliver 
the required evidence. And this is the empirical way. We 
need empirical arguments in order to show that the per￾sonal identity of others is the needed prerequisite for our 
self-awareness as someone and, consequently, for our own 
sense of personal identity. Again, this is not a philosophi￾cal question anymore, but an empirical one.
So, if I want to demonstrate the idea of human dignity 
as the adequate foundation of human rights, I need to set 
up an empirical thesis and I need to provide empirical evi￾dence to support this thesis.
The appropriate empirical thesis that is suffcient and 
adequate in order to justify the generality of human dig￾nity is the following:
» My authenticity and the authenticity of others are equipri￾mordial.
Equiprimordiality means that the existence of two entities 
depends on each other because the frst entity can only 
exist if the second entity exists and the second entity can 
only exist if the frst one exists. Both of them are required 
conditions for the possibility of each other. Either both of 
them exist or neither of them do. So, both of them can be 
considered as two sides of the same coin. If this thesis is 
true, it then follows that it is not possible to regard my 
personhood as absolute if I do not also regard the person￾hood of others as absolute. And the other way round: if I 
do not regard the personhood of others as absolute then I 
cannot regard my own personhood as absolute.
I hope that you understand the importance of this the￾sis. The relevance of the idea of human dignity as a suff￾cient principle for the foundation of human rights depends 
on whether this thesis is true or false.
It is interesting to note that the equiprimordiality the￾sis is not really new. Rather, it is deeply rooted in the tradi￾Equiprimordiality
Fichte/Hegel
95
5.4 · “Me-Dignity” and General Human Dignity5
tion of philosophy, in particular in the philosophy of the 
so-called German Idealism of the nineteenth century. 
Historically, the frst philosopher who defended a kind of 
equiprimordiality thesis was Johann Gottlieb Fichte, who 
developed this idea in the context of a foundation for the 
concept of law and legal relationship. Much more famous 
but also much more unclear and very diffcult to under￾stand is the chapter “Master and Slave” in Georg Friedrich 
Hegel’s book Phenomenology of Spirit. Both philosophers 
thought they would develop a pure philosophical argu￾ment. Nevertheless, they were wrong insofar as the equi￾primordiality thesis does not refer to a pure analysis of a 
concept. It does not deal with language but with particular 
phenomena in the real world. Fichte and Hegel claimed an 
empirical argument without any empirical evidence. The 
argument was nevertheless very convincing for many intel￾lectuals because it met a deeply rooted intuition. Intuitions, 
however, are not proofs and therefore we cannot avoid 
searching for empirical evidence. Still, Fichte and Hegel 
were not completely wrong. We will see that empirical evi￾dence must be contemplated through philosophical con￾siderations. But this is the second step of the argumentation. 
First, we have to look for empirical evidence.
Many philosophers begin to severely suffer if their the￾ories depend on empirical evidence. They share the opin￾ion that philosophical insights are always absolutely 
certain while empirical knowledge is always subject to the 
risk of error. Therefore, they think that philosophical 
results must always be independent from empirical evi￾dence.
I do not think that philosophical insights are always 
absolutely certain. I believe that philosophy is also a mat￾ter of error. But it is true that philosophy is not an empiri￾cal science. The analysis of language does not expose the 
facts of the world but only the structure of our thinking. 
Therefore, the scope of philosophical insights is very lim￾ited. Philosophy never leads to an insight about the reality 
of the world outside of our own thoughts about the world. 
Philosophy can therefore only prepare the empirical 
research. Comparatively, empirical sciences depend on an 
adequate formulation of their own problems and ques￾tions. Philosophy can help identify adequate formulations 
but it cannot help to answer the questions of the empirical 
sciences.
The question of the meaning of the concept of human 
dignity is a philosophical question. But whether our self￾Empircism and 
Philosophy
96 Chapter 5 · The Human Dignity Principle I5
awareness as someone and not only as something depends 
on recognizing and appreciating the personal identity of 
others is an empirical question.
In the next chapter, I will present some empirical evi￾dence that to me seems suffcient to prove the equiprimor￾diality thesis. At the end of this chapter, I want to discuss 
another question. What should we do if the empirical evi￾dence for the equiprimordiality thesis should fail?
5.5 The Risk of Empirical Error
With regard to this case, some legal philosophers think 
that they must interpret the concept of human dignity in 
another way. They think that they do not have any alterna￾tive because the human dignity principle was established 
in international law and, as jurists, they have to respect the 
legal text.
There are some other interpretations. One of them is to 
simply consider the concept of human dignity as a collec￾tive name for the sum of all human rights. This solution is 
obviously a stopgap which is not very convincing. The 
concept “human rights” is already a collective that 
embraces all the particular human rights. It is a meaning￾less duplication to introduce one collective (human dig￾nity) to cover another (human rights). Other philosophers 
claim that the human dignity principle would be a particu￾lar human right of its own. This is also not very convinc￾ing simply because international law deals with human 
dignity as a principle from which human rights can be 
derived rather than as a human right among others.
If our research for empirical evidence in favor of the 
equiprimordiality thesis should fail, we should be so hon￾est as to confess that there is nothing in reality that under￾lies the concept of human dignity. In such a case, the 
concept of human dignity is an empty concept that is an 
inadequate foundation for human rights. The fact that a 
concept is empty—i.e., that there is nothing in reality that 
underlies the concept—does not allow for a change in the 
meaning of the concept. This can be shown by the exam￾ple of a unicorn. This concept is defned by the elements 
of being an animal that looks similar to a white horse but 
with a spiraling horn on his forehead, which can only be 
seen and captured by a virgin. According to the prevailing 
opinion, unicorns are mythological creatures and do not 
exist in reality. Nevertheless, this does not give us the right 
Alternative 
Interpretation
97
5.5 · The Risk of Empirical Error5
to change the meaning of the concept “unicorn.” If we 
change the meaning of the word “unicorn,” we would lose 
the opportunity to say that unicorns do not exist. This 
shows that the meaning of a concept and whether there is 
something in reality that meets the concept are different 
questions and the latter may not infuence the former.
The same thing also occurs with the concept of human 
dignity. If our empirical claim of the equiprimordiality 
thesis is proven to not be true because empirical research 
can show that either I can develop personhood and an 
estimating relationship to my personhood without being 
recognized as a person by others or that I can maintain my 
own personhood even if I disregard and ignore the per￾sonhood of others, then we would must conclude that it is 
not possible to issue an absolute value judgment of the 
personhood of others and that therefore nobody can 
regard the personhood of others as absolute valuable. In 
such a case, we would say that human dignity does not 
really exists. Instead, human dignity would be a mirage, a 
fata morgana, a pure ideology that is not suitable to deliver 
a foundation for human rights.
Thus, we see that the justifcation of human rights 
through the principle of human dignity stands or falls 
with the truth of the equiprimordiality thesis. This will be 
the subject of the next lesson.

Analysis of the Concept “Human Dignity”
The analysis of the concept “human dignity” consists 
of two parts. Part I concerns the philosophical analysis, 
i.e., the defnition of the term. Part II concerns the 
empirical analysis, i.e., the question whether the con￾cept “human dignity” refers to reality. If there is a refer￾ence to reality, the concept is empirically saturated and 
therefore suffciently qualifed as the foundation of 
human rights. Otherwise, the concept is empty and 
under no circumstances qualifed as a foundation of 
human rights.
The Generality of Human Dignity
The generality of human dignity requires that every 
person must evaluate not only their own personhood as 
absolute but also the personhood of every other per￾son. The personhood of another person only has abso￾lute value for me if my own personal authenticity 
depends on the personal authenticity of others. This is 
true only if the equiprimordiality thesis is true.
The Equiprimordiality Thesis
The personhood of any person and the personhood of 
any other person are equiprimordial. This is an empiri￾cal hypothesis that must be confrmed or refuted by 
empirical evidence.

Empirical Evidence
1. If the equiprimordiality thesis is true, then the devel￾opment of A’s personhood must depend on B’s rec￾ognition of A as a person. If this is the case, then the 
non-recognition of A’s personhood by B must with 
high probability lead to a serious disorder of A’s per￾sonal identity. 
Evidence: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
2. If the equiprimordiality thesis is true, A must be able 
to simultaneously recognize themself and other per￾sons as persons. Otherwise, A would not be able to 
understand the recognition of themself by another. 
(Things that are purely things do not have a concept 
of recognition.) Indeed, human babies are able to 
recognize other persons as persons. They inherently 
possess a sense of personhood. 
Evidence: Empirical Baby Research and the 
results of Developmental Psychology
3. If the equiprimordiality thesis is true, person A must 
lose their relationship to their own personhood if A 
is not recognized as a person by others, whether in 
the initial developmental phase of childhood or at 
some point during their life. Indeed, it is possible to 
alienate a person A from their own personhood 
through torture, rape, or the deprivation of all self￾control. 
Evidence: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
4. If the equiprimordiality thesis is true, person A must 
with high probability experience alienation from 
their own personhood if they do not respect the per￾sonhood of others. Indeed, persons who cease to 
respect the personhood of others may lose their rela￾tionship to their own personhood 
Evidence: (a) The feeling of shame that tends 
toward suicide; (b) the feeling of guilt that makes 
persons able to survive while at the same time pro￾ducing intense pain for them; (c) serious neuroses 
which occur when persons try to avoid the feelings 
of shame or guilt. Tillich: “Neurosis is a method to 
avoid non-being by avoiding being.”

The Human Dignity Principle II6
The Limited Range of Empirical Evidence
Empirical research only focuses on the more or less 
close relationships between persons. It seems to only 
show that one’s own personal identity depends on 
mutual recognition within a limited reference group 
(baby and its caregivers, adult person and those who 
encounter them.). So, it does not seem to be proven that 
the personal identity of a particular person depends on 
the mutual recognition of all persons all over the world. 
This would lead to the result that there is only some￾thing like a “Group-Dignity” in a communitarian sense, 
but not human dignity as a general value.
It can be shown by the means of philosophy 
(thought experiment “dignity certifcate”) that this pre￾sumption is meaningless. It is not possible to assign 
absolute value to only some persons while denying the 
same assignation to any other person.
6.1 The Equiprimordiality Thesis
In the last chapter, I tried to analyze the meaning of the 
concept of human dignity. The result was the following:
Human dignity is the name or the abbreviation or the 
short form of a value judgment concerning the human 
individual. This value judgment is understood as a state￾ment of its defendants—whoever this might be—accord￾ing to which personhood is estimated as an absolute value. 
Absoluteness means that the value does not depend on the 
rank in a preference order or on the function as a means 
of exchange. The only entity that can be considered abso￾lutely valuable is personhood (personal identity, authen￾ticity). Personhood is the ability to evaluate. The ability to 
evaluate is the condition of the possibility that anything 
can have a (relative) value at all.
It is relatively easy to show that, for me, my own per￾sonhood has an absolute value because it is the required 
condition for awareness of myself as the author of my 
will—awareness of myself as someone and not just as 
something. Nevertheless, the absolute evaluation of my 
own personhood does not meet the concept of human dig￾nity because this term refers not only to my personhood 
(me-dignity) but also to the personhood of every person 
Summary
104 Chapter 6 · The Human Dignity Principle II6
(generalization). If the human dignity-judgment is at all 
possible, it must be shown that the personhood of all oth￾ers has exactly the same importance to me as my own per￾sonhood. In other words, to me the personhood of others 
has absolute value just as my own. This is only conceivable 
if my own personhood and the personhood of others are 
equiprimordial—if they are both sides of the same coin.
The necessity of the equiprimordiality thesis for the 
generality of human dignity can be explained through 
philosophical analysis. But the means of philosophy do 
not demonstrate that my own personhood and the person￾hood of others are actually equiprimordial. Because this 
question does not refer to the meaning of words and the 
analysis of ideas, but to a reality outside of our language. 
Philosophical analysis only shows the meaning of the con￾cept human dignity without showing that there is some￾thing in reality that actually meets the concept. Knowledge 
about the reality outside of our language is only available 
through empirical research. The philosophical analysis 
presents the equiprimordiality thesis as the required con￾dition for the reality of the human dignity conception. 
Thus, it is important to show through empirical research 
that the equiprimordiality thesis is true. For that purpose, 
we must empirically prove that there is a mutual interde￾pendency between self-awareness and self-esteem as per￾sons and awareness and appreciation of other persons as 
persons.
6.2 Dependence on Passive Recognition 
of Personhood
The equiprimordiality thesis is confrmed if there is a 
mutual interdependency in the recognition of the person￾hood of person A by others and the recognition of the 
personhood of others by A. This can be proven by deter￾mining what happens with the personhood of A if it is not 
recognized by the others around A.  Indeed, it can be 
shown that person A suffers from a serious defciency of 
personhood when there is a lack of recognition of A’s per￾sonhood by the others around A. This is evident by the 
symptoms of serious psychological diseases. For example, 
if the potential personhood of a baby or a little child is not 
recognized by its caregivers, the child may develop a 
BPD
105
6.2 · Dependence on Passive Recognition of Personhood6
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD—ICD-10-WHO: 
F60.31). 1 This term refers to a personality disorder, where, 
in essence, a person has not developed the ability to live 
her life authentically—that is, she lives as something 
instead of as someone.
BPD presents different symptoms including:
5 Out-of-control emotions
5 Unstable interpersonal relationships and self-esteem
5 Fear of abandonment
5 Self-damaging behavior
5 Impulsivity
5 Thoughts and sensitivity to rejection
5 Unusually intense sensitivity in relationships with oth￾ers
5 Diffculty regulating emotions
5 Unsure feeling of one’s personal identity and values
5 Paranoid thoughts when feeling stressed
5 Severe dissociation (a particular detachment from real￾ity; negative or dysfunctional mental constructions of 
phantasy in order to avoid fear and anxiety.)
People with BPD are often exceptionally idealistic, joyful, 
and loving. Nevertheless, they may feel overwhelmed by 
negative emotions, experiencing intense grief instead of 
sadness, shame, and humiliation instead of mild embar￾rassment, rage instead of annoyance, and panic instead of 
nervousness. People with BPD are especially sensitive to 
feelings of self-negation, rejection, isolation, and per￾ceived failure. Their efforts to manage or escape from their 
intense negative emotions may lead to self-injury or sui￾cidal behavior.
In addition to intense emotions, people with BPD 
experience emotional volatility, rapid changes between 
depression and elation; their mood frequently swings 
between anger and anxiety or depression and anxiety. 
Impulsive behavior is common, including substance or 
alcohol abuse, eating disorders, unprotected sex or indis￾criminate sex with multiple partners, reckless spending, 
and reckless driving. Impulsive behavior may also include 
leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury.
1 ICD-10-WHO is the tenth revision of the International Statistical 
Classifcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems, a medical 
classifcation list published by the World Health Organization – see 
7 https://www.who.int/classifcations/icd/en/.
106 Chapter 6 · The Human Dignity Principle II6
People with BPD tend to have trouble seeing a clear 
picture of their identity. They particularly tend to experi￾ence diffculty knowing what they value, believe, prefer, or 
enjoy. They are often unsure about their long-term goals 
for relationships and jobs. This diffculty with knowing 
who they are and what they value can cause people with 
BPD to experience feelings of emptiness and desolateness.
What are the causes of BPD? According to present sci￾entifc trends, some researchers share the opinion that cer￾tain brain abnormalities cause BPD. Nevertheless, it seems 
possible to empirically show that the diagnosed brain 
abnormalities very often are not the result of biological 
coincidence and that they may be caused by depriving an 
individual of recognition and appreciation as a person in 
the stages of early childhood. Statistical research shows 
that 70% of people who suffer from BPD were sexually 
abused in their early childhood. 50% experienced physical 
violence. Further, 80% of the adults with BPD report 
instances of emotional neglect in their childhood.
BPD may not necessarily be caused by abuse or mal￾treatment. It can also be caused by the early experience of 
abandonment or signifcant trouble, chaos, and hostility in 
the family or by the experience of a parenting style that is 
characterized as rigid loveless control or an overly tight 
bond that leaves no room for independent development of 
personality.
According to the so-called psychologically-based 
Attachment Theory, individuals very often experience 
BPD symptoms if they received less attention or sensitive 
care, if their needs and feelings were ignored, and/or if 
they could not rely on their caregivers. In other words, 
people tend to suffer from BPD if they were not recog￾nized and appreciated as persons that must learn to lead 
their lives on the basis of their own considerations and 
refections—as someone and not just as something.
What we have shown so far is that the development of 
personhood during the early stages of childhood depends 
on the recognition and appreciation of the child’s (poten￾tial) personhood by other persons. Nevertheless, such evi￾dence is not suffcient for the verifcation of the 
equiprimordiality thesis. For it could be possible that the 
process of developing personhood initially depends on 
recognition by others, but that we become independent of 
it when our personhood has developed. The Borderline 
Disorder argument does not exclude the possibility that 
personhood—once developed—is a capacity that we can 
Causes of BPD
107
6.2 · Dependence on Passive Recognition of Personhood6
maintain without the support of others. If this is true than 
the value of personhood of others would only be absolute 
during the time of our own psycho-social development in 
early childhood, and it would cease to be absolute once the 
psycho-social development of personal identity has fn￾ished.
The value of personhood of others only remains abso￾lute if throughout our lifetime we continue to depend on 
the recognition and appreciation of personhood by others. 
In order to show this dependence, we need other empirical 
fndings. But again, the results of psychological research 
can deliver these fndings. Accordingly, we must look at 
what happens when someone who has already developed 
personal identity and is already able to manifest their own 
free will based on their own considerations and refections 
is treated as a mere object or thing by their fellow humans.
Psychiatric traumatology teaches us what happens in 
such a situation. It leads to another very specifc disorder 
that is called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. This term 
refers to a personality disorder where, in essence, a person 
has lost the ability to live their life authentically—as some￾one and not just as something.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD—ICD-10 
WHO: F43.1) is a mental health condition that is triggered 
by a terrifying event such as sexual assault, warfare, seri￾ous injury, or threats of imminent death. PTSD symptoms 
are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, 
avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and 
changes in emotional reactions.
Symptoms of intrusive memories may include:
5 Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of a trau￾matic event
5 Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening 
again (fashbacks)
5 Upsetting dreams about the traumatic event 
(nightmares)
5 Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to 
something that reminds the person of the traumatic 
event
Symptoms of avoidance may include:
5 Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic 
event
5 Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of 
the traumatic event
PTSD
108 Chapter 6 · The Human Dignity Principle II6
Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood 
may include:
5 Negative feelings about oneself or other people
5 Inability to experience positive emotions
5 Feeling emotionally numb
5 Lack of interest in activities once enjoyed
5 Hopelessness about the future
5 Memory problems, including not remembering impor￾tant aspects of the traumatic event
5 Diffculty maintaining close relationships
Symptoms of changes in emotional reactions (also 
called arousal symptoms) may include:
5 Irritability, angry outbursts, or aggressive behavior
5 Always being on guard for danger
5 Overwhelming guilt or shame
5 Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or 
driving too fast
5 Trouble concentrating
5 Trouble sleeping
5 Being easily startled or frightened
5 Suicidal thoughts
It is interesting to note that many of these symptoms are 
very similar to those of BPD. That, in turn, shows that the 
capacity of personhood can be lost. Personhood is a frag￾ile possession.
As I mentioned above, PTSD is caused by the experi￾ence of severe psycho-traumata. Psycho-Traumata are 
defned as situations where a person loses any kind of self￾control. Riedesser & Fischer defne psycho-trauma as the 
violation of the personal ability of self-determination and 
of the room for development of a personality. Such a vio￾lation occurs in situations where an individual is exposed 
to an overwhelming power that does not allow reasonable 
reaction and makes the individual completely unable to 
act. This is, for example, a situation in which a person is 
raped. Other situations include those where soldiers are 
under fre or where someone is tortured. In other words, 
PTSD occurs as a result of situations where human indi￾viduals are not recognized and appreciated as persons that 
can lead their own lives on the basis of their own consider￾ations and refections. PTSD occurs as the result of situa￾tions where someone is no longer recognized as someone, 
but as something. PTSD can occur not only as a result of 
disregard and disrespect, but also as a result of a horrible

109
6.2 · Dependence on Passive Recognition of Personhood6
natural disaster or an accident, where someone experi￾ences a complete loss of control or infuence. Nevertheless, 
for our purpose it is enough to show that even disregard or 
disrespect of someone’s personhood can lead to 
PTSD. Furthermore, there is suffcient evidence indicating 
that it is much more diffcult to heal someone suffering 
from PTSD caused by other human beings as opposed to 
cases involving natural causes or accidents.
It may be useful to point out that not every soldier who 
was under fre and not every person who was raped subse￾quently suffers from PTSD. Many people who go through 
traumatic events have diffculty adjusting and coping for a 
time without developing PTSD. With time and good self￾care, they usually get better. Those people have the capac￾ity of resilience. The scope of an individual’s resilience 
depends on their life experiences before the traumatic 
event. Not every traumatic event leads to PTSD in every 
person. But every person will suffer from PTSD if the level 
of the traumatic event is severe enough. It is possible that 
an individual who suffered severe torture nevertheless 
does not subsequently suffer from PTSD. But a torturer 
can bring every person to this state if they increase the 
torture suffciently. So, we can learn from the empirical 
phenomenon of the PTSD that persons can lose their per￾sonhood such that they are no longer someone, but some￾thing. This shows that we depend on the recognition and 
appreciation as persons by other persons not only during 
the stages of early childhood but also throughout our life￾time.
6.3 Dependence on Active Recognition 
of Personhood
The equiprimordiality thesis claims that personhood is 
based on mutual recognition and appreciation. Mutuality 
means that we cannot develop or maintain our own per￾sonhood when we do not recognize the personhood of 
others. But what about a baby? Is a baby able to recognize 
the personhood of its caregivers? A baby or a small child 
is not able to determine its behavior on the basis of an own 
free will, i.e., on the basis of their own refections and con￾siderations. Therefore, we cannot say that babies or small 
children are persons in the meaning of the term “person” 
that I have developed above. But how is it possible to rec￾Resilience
Proto-persons
110 Chapter 6 · The Human Dignity Principle II6
ognize the personhood of others without frst being a per￾son? I think it is not possible to recognize the personhood 
of others without being a person because only persons can 
know what is meant by personhood and it is necessary to 
know what personhood is in order to recognize person￾hood in another person.
That seems to preclude the ability of babies to recog￾nize their caregivers as persons. Nevertheless, we know 
from the phenomenon of BPD that it is crucial to be rec￾ognized as a person in the early stages of life, otherwise a 
child may never develop the capacity of personhood. But 
can we imagine that the recognition as person by caregiv￾ers can have any effect for the baby if the baby cannot 
understand this recognition as the recognition as person? I 
think it is not possible to understand being recognized as 
a person by other persons if one does not have any under￾standing of what is meant by personhood. Therefore dogs, 
horses, and cars cannot develop personhood even if they 
are recognized as persons. But the baby can. How is this 
possible?
Let us consider the problem from the point of view of 
the caregivers. How should they be able to recognize the 
personhood of the baby when the baby has yet to develop 
personhood? Recognition can only have as its object some 
aspect of reality. It is not possible to recognize something 
that does not exist. If there is no such thing as the person￾hood of the baby, then caregivers could not recognize it. 
This suggests that treating a baby as a person is not really 
an act of recognition and appreciation, but rather an act 
of producing the personhood of the child. If it is consid￾ered an act of producing and not an act of recognition, we 
cannot talk about a relationship of mutual recognition in 
the stages of early childhood. So, there is not only a prob￾lem from the perspective of the baby, but also from the 
perspective of the caregivers.
Empirical research comes into the play at this point. 
According to developmental psychology and empirical 
baby research, we have empirical evidence for the fact that 
babies naturally possess a sense for personhood. Like a 
radar, they scan the world to detect personhood and they 
fx their attention upon those objects in their environment 
in which they recognize personhood. Thus, although 
babies do not have the capacity of an intellectual under￾standing of personhood, they are naturally endowed with 
the capacity to feel and to identify personhood wherever 
111
6.3 · Dependence on Active Recognition of Personhood6
they meet it. This is why we can state that babies can rec￾ognize and appreciate the personhood of others. According 
to empirical baby research, it is not adequate to consider a 
human baby a living entity without personhood. We must 
instead state that babies are considered proto-persons. 
They are not able to produce their own will, but they are 
already capable of recognizing the personhood of others 
and identifying these others as a source from which they 
can learn to become persons themselves.
From this fact follows that treating a baby as a person 
is not simply an act of producing the personhood of the 
baby, but rather an act of support through real, interper￾sonal communication. It is thus an act of recognition. So, 
we see that there is a real mutual recognition and apprecia￾tion of personhood between a baby and its caregivers. Not 
only do babies receive recognition of their personhood by 
their caregiver, but caregivers also receive recognition of 
their personhood by babies. This is why the caregivers of 
babies ordinarily do not have a problem treating the babies 
as persons by speaking to them, laughing with them, or 
generally communicating with them as persons. Caregivers 
can of course deny recognizing babies as persons. But by 
doing so, they in turn block the possibility of being recog￾nized as persons by the babies. This raises the question of 
what consequences it has for a person if he decides not to 
recognize the personhood of his fellow human beings, be 
they babies or adults.
It can be shown that the refusal to recognize the per￾sonhood of others leads to the loss of the ability to iden￾tify with one’s own personhood. The result is an existential 
form of self-alienation, which is associated with an enor￾mous amount of suffering. We can distinguish three 
different varieties of suffering that all have the same ori￾gin. They are feelings of shame, feelings of guilt and vari￾ants of repression in the form of neuroses.
Let’s start with the feeling of shame. Shame is the feel￾ing of fundamental loss of self-esteem. The individual 
who feels shame despises and condemns himself. 
Nevertheless, shame is a social feeling. It is always related 
to other persons. It is not necessary that the other person 
is a real person or that real persons have real knowledge 
about why the respective individual feels shame. The indi￾vidual who feels shame imagines the others. Psychoanalysis 
speaks of this phenomenon in terms of the Imagined 
Other. So, the individual who feels shame takes the posi￾tion of the Imagined Others and, from this point of view, 
Shame
112 Chapter 6 · The Human Dignity Principle II6
delivers a value judgment about himself. According to this 
value judgment, the individual feels himself as having no 
worth and as someone who is to be despised. The feeling 
of shame is always connected with a huge fear of being 
excluded from the community and the thought that it 
would indeed be reasonable and appropriate to be excluded 
from the community because of the respective person’s 
self-perceived lack of value.
So, the feeling of shame necessarily implicates the rec￾ognition and respect of other persons—otherwise, one 
could not be ashamed in front of them. The feeling of 
shame disclaims the decision of a person to treat others as 
non-persons and shows that, for that person, recognizing 
and respecting others as persons is unavoidable.
The feeling of shame is so fundamental that the respec￾tive individual is incapable to identify himself with his 
own personhood. He loses trust in his own ability to pro￾duce a free will and to act on the basis of his own consid￾erations and refections. Someone who feels deep shame 
wants to literally disappear. He wishes the ground would 
open and swallow him up. He feels completely unable to 
act. He fguratively turns to stone or becomes petrifed or 
freezes to ice. The ultimate consequence of a deep feeling 
of shame is suicide because this is the only way to com￾pletely disappear. Indeed, sometimes we hear about cases 
where a criminal committed suicide because he was so 
overwhelmed with shame that he could not bear to live 
anymore.
But committing suicide is not the rule. Most people 
who feel shame develop a strategy that makes them capa￾ble of avoiding suicide and continue with their lives. The 
most appropriate strategy is the transformation of the 
feeling of shame into the feeling of guilt. I think all of us 
know the feeling of shame, but obviously we did not com￾mit suicide. We were able to continue living because we 
were able to transform our feelings of shame into feelings 
of guilt. When analyzing the feeling of guilt, we can iden￾tify three elements.
1. The frst element of guilt is repentance. There is a cer￾tain similarity between shame and repentance. 
Repentance, like shame, is the result of a negative value 
judgment about oneself. Contrary to shame, this judg￾ment does not refer to the entire being of oneself. It 
only refers to one’s own bad actions. With feelings of 
repentance, the individual is capable of distinguishing 
between himself and the actions he has done. The feel￾Guilt
113
6.3 · Dependence on Active Recognition of Personhood6
ing of repentance allows for the condemnation of 
actions while the person herself is rescued from con￾demnation and contempt. This allows the individual to 
remain capable of acting so that he may work towards 
a reconciliation with himself.
2. The second element of the feeling of guilt is confession
and the wish to compensate. This second element is a 
feeling of desire—namely, the desire to become worthy 
of reconciliation. This feeling, like shame, is a social 
feeling. It is not possible to reconcile with one’s own 
actions without reconciliation with those who were 
harmed through the bad actions. The desire to become 
worthy of reconciliation therefore leads to the drive to 
confess in front of the victim and to compensate for the 
damage done to the victim. The confession is the 
request to not be identifed with the bad actions that 
the agent committed. It is connected to the request to 
again trust that the agent is a reliable and good person, 
not an evil one.
3. The third element of the feeling of guilt is the request 
for forgiveness. If the respective person does feel as 
though she has reached a status of being worthy of rec￾onciliation, she will ask for forgiveness.
As we have seen, the feelings of shame and guilt are social 
feelings. They implicate the recognition and the respect of 
other persons as persons. Either the person in question 
commits suicide because she is unable to overcome the 
feeling of shame, or the person feels guilt. In both cases 
the person understands that ignoring the personhood of 
others is incompatible with her own personal identity.
Perhaps you will object to this argumentation by show￾ing that many people ignore and disregard the personhood 
of others but do not show any symptom or manifestation 
of shame or guilt. Sometimes they even seem to be proud 
of their crimes. Their understanding of themselves seems 
to be unbroken. They lead their lives as if nothing had 
happened. This seemingly suggests that the equiprimordi￾ality thesis is wrong.
Nevertheless, we must consider that the transforma￾tion of the feeling of shame into the feeling of guilt is not 
the only strategy to avoid suicide. There are several other 
strategies. All of these alternatives are a kind of psychical 
displacement. The feeling of shame is displaced by any 
other feeling like anxiety, rage, aggression, depression, 
phobia, or by obsessive behavior patterns like excessive 
Neuroses
114 Chapter 6 · The Human Dignity Principle II6
pedantry, excessive hand washing, etc. None of these feel￾ings or behaviors are adequate. Therefore, they produce 
diffculties and trouble for the respective agent or for the 
individuals who are related to them. The psychoanalyst 
Sigmund Freud coined the concept of neuroses to describe 
these different strategies.
Such unconscious displacements have the advantage 
that the person concerned is not forced to suffer from 
shame and guilt. Nevertheless, displacement inevitably 
leads to other forms of suffering. It is possible that the 
strange behavior of a person brings her into confict with 
her fellow humans and that she therefore suffers from this 
confict. Nevertheless, it is also possible that the person 
does not really suffer herself but that she causes others to 
suffer through her tyranny or unreliable behavior, etc. The 
deeper problem of neuroses is that the connection between 
the symptoms and the causes is unconscious while in the 
case of shame and guilt the connection is conscious. The 
latent aspect of the causes of neuroses makes it much 
more diffcult to free oneself from neurotic suffering. In 
any case, the benefts of the neurotic alternatives to shame 
and guilt are most impressively expressed by the saying of 
Paul Tillich: “Neurosis is the method of avoiding non￾being by avoiding being”.
The extent to which contempt for humanity can destroy 
one’s own personal identity was impressively illustrated by 
Hannah Arendt in her report on the Eichmann trial in 
Jerusalem. She reports a statement by Eichmann accord￾ing to which, while he oversaw the transport of European 
Jews to the extermination camps, he had been completely 
indifferent to death - not only to the death of his victims, 
but also to his own death (Arendt p. 106). Arendt consid￾ers this statement credible and tells two stories from other 
sources to confrm it. In the summer of 1944, a female SS 
leader gave a pep talk to Bavarian peasants. She spoke 
openly about a possible defeat, which, however, no good 
German needed to worry about, because the Führer “in 
his great goodness had prepared for the whole German 
people a mild death through gassing in case the war should 
have an unhappy end”. The peasants took note of it with 
equanimity. A similar statement was made by an ordinary 
woman in East Prussia who was feeing from the Russian

6.3 · Dependence on Active Recognition of Personhood6
6.4 Verifcation or Failing of Falsifcation?
The reference to shame, guilt, and neuroses confrms the 
suspicion that ignoring or disregarding the personhood of 
others is unlikely to be possible without producing unac￾ceptable self-suffering and/or self-alienation. Nevertheless, 
this does not represent particularly strong evidence. A rig￾orous proof would need to show that it is objectively 
impossible to maintain one’s own personhood by disre￾garding the personhood of others. Empirical evidence can 
never provide such a complete proof. To perform such 
empirical evidence, one would have to search the entire 
world for a case where a person disregards and ignores the 
personhood of others while remaining healthy and free 
from suffering. Such a proof is hardly possible.
We must recognize that empirical evidence never proves 
general hypotheses. Verifcation in that sense is not possi￾ble. Therefore, we should follow the idea of the so-called 
Critical Rationalism as it was developed by the Austrian/
British philosopher Karl Popper and the German philoso￾pher Karl Albert. According to this approach, we are jus￾tifed in accepting an empirical thesis as long as all attempts 
to falsify it have failed. In our case, we have several refer￾ences that confrm the thesis, and we have no evidence that 
shows the thesis to be false. Therefore, it is rational to 
accept it.
So, I come to the conclusion that the equiprimordiality 
thesis is empirically well confrmed and should be consid￾ered true.
6.5 The Generality of the Equiprimordiality 
Thesis
Nevertheless, there is another objection to the claim that 
the principle of human dignity can be explained and clari￾fed by the equiprimordiality thesis. We have only shown 
so far that persons depend on the mutual recognition and 
appreciation (respect) of other persons for the sake of 
maintaining their personhood. But it does not seem to be 
proven that persons depend on the recognition and appre￾ciation of all other persons in the world. What seems to be 
proven so far is only a concept of human dignity that 
applies to myself and to the persons in my narrow environ￾ment. The concept might apply to the family or to the 
Critical Rationalism
116 Chapter 6 · The Human Dignity Principle II6
circle of friends or perhaps to the neighborhood. But it 
seems to not apply to every living entity or at least to every 
human being who is endowed with personhood. The idea 
of human dignity, nevertheless, can only function as an 
adequate foundation of human rights if it applies to every 
member of the human family or, at least, to every member 
of the human family who is endowed with reason and con￾science and is therefore a person.
However, a closer look shows that the equiprimordial￾ity thesis is adequate enough to construct the principle of 
human dignity as a general principle that applies to every 
person in the world. At this step of the argumentation, we 
again turn to the feld of philosophy. Here, we do no lon￾ger use empirical arguments but a pure transcendental 
argument instead. I want to demonstrate this argument in 
the shape of a thought experiment.
Please imagine that you are in a position to decide to 
whom you want to ascribe human dignity or, in other 
words, whose personhood you want to regard as an abso￾lute value (see . Fig. 6.1). Let’s say you are sitting behind 
a desk and in front of you is a huge queue which embraces 
the entirety of mankind. One by one appear before your 
desk and you decide whether or not to give them a certif￾cate of personal recognition.
Dignity Certifcate

6.5 · The Generality of the Equiprimordiality Thesis6
The frst individual before your desk is your mother. 
Given the case that your mother was your primary 
caregiver in your childhood and that you therefore love 
her, you do not hesitate to give her the certifcate. The next 
individual is someone you have never met before and that 
you will never again meet in the future. Whether he exists 
makes no difference to your personal life. Will you give 
him the certifcate? Perhaps you think that it is more effec￾tive for you to withhold the certifcate because giving the 
document would lead to the consequence that you are 
obliged to respect the human rights of this unknown and 
uninteresting individual. Why should you take on this bur￾den? So, you withhold the certifcate. The next individual 
before your desk is a very famous criminal, let us say a 
cruel terrorist who appeared on YouTube several times, 
killing innocent people by beheading them. Will you give 
him the certifcate? Perhaps you think that such horrible 
humans should be considered monsters and not persons 
and therefore you do not hesitate to withhold the certif￾cate of personhood.
Now the question arises: is it possible to regard the per￾sonhood of your mother as an absolute while simultane￾ously denying the personhood of the unknown individual 
or of the criminal? Transcendental analysis shows that 
such a different treatment of your mother and the other 
persons is conceptually untenable. The mistake lies in the 
assumption that it is possible to decide to whom you want 
to ascribe dignity and to whom you will not. This is not 
possible because in order to make such a decision you 
need criteria to distinguish the two categories. These crite￾ria have nothing to do with the fact that the individuals in 
front of your desk are persons or at least potential per￾sons. Personhood is not the determinative criterion, some￾thing else is. This “something else” is necessarily and 
unavoidably something of relative value, e.g., your use, 
your interest, your love, your fear, or any other criterion of 
preference. The same criteria that guides your decision 
about your mother is relevant to the decisions about any 
other person. So, you recognize and respect the person￾hood of your mother only because she is the object of 
your love or because she is useful for you. In other words, 
the estimation of the personhood of your mother is no 
longer absolute, but relative. Put differently, if you only 
esteem one person in the world absolutely, you cannot 
avoid esteeming every other person in the world absolutely.
118 Chapter 6 · The Human Dignity Principle II6.6 Human Dignity in Cases of Doubt
Human dignity refers to the absolute value of person￾hood. The bearers of human dignity are therefore persons 
and—as we have seen above—proto-persons. Nevertheless, 
there are some cases where it is contested whether the 
respective individual can be considered a person.
This is especially true for human embryos. Should 
human embryos be considered bearers of human dignity? 
Are they included in the human dignity judgment? Yes, I 
think they must be considered persons. Killing an embryo 
is always connected to the value judgment that the person 
who is going to emerge from the embryo is not worth of 
existing. Denying as much is based on intrinsic or extrinsic 
evaluations of an embryo’s capacity to develop person￾hood and therefore not in terms of the absolute value that 
is indicative of personhood.
What about the case of individuals that suffer from 
dementia? Are they still persons or does the disease take 
away their personhood? Indeed, in the fnal stages of the 
disease we can hardly talk about a person because the dis￾ease completely eliminates an individual’s ability to deter￾mine oneself on the basis of their own considerations and 
refections. But not every individual that suffers from 
dementia has lost their personhood. Personhood is a 
threshold value concept. There are no grades of person￾hood. Rather, someone either has personhood or they do 
not. In most cases, people with dementia are still consid￾ered persons.
And what about an individual in a prolonged coma? Is 
he still a person? If we can expect the individual to wake 
up and continue to live his life as a person, he, like an 
embryo, must at the very least be considered a potential 
person.
Many philosophers object to this concept of human 
dignity with the argument that it does not capture all 
human beings, but only those who can be considered per￾sons. They fear that from this restriction follows that 
humans who are not persons (anymore or from the begin￾ning of their life) can be treated in a way that we normally 
consider inhumane. That is to say, they conclude that 
according to this theory it is permissible to kill or torture 
human beings without personhood. They think, however, 
that even non-personal human beings should be protected 
against maltreatment.

6.6 · Human Dignity in Cases of Doubt6
But these objections are not very convincing. First, just 
because only personhood can be considered an absolute 
value does not mean that non-personal human beings can 
be treated arbitrarily and that there are no moral stan￾dards toward them. For there is nothing to prevent us 
from ascribing intrinsic value to non-personal human 
beings as well. Secondly, these philosophers do not justify 
but already presuppose that non-personal humans may 
not be arbitrarily killed or tortured. Thus, this conviction 
obviously does not depend on a particular conception of 
human dignity but exists independently of it. They already 
know what is morally required and what is morally forbid￾den, without having to be instructed about it frst by means 
of the concept of human dignity. There is no contradic￾tion between the idea of personhood as an absolute value 
and the idea that even non-personal human beings may 
not be treated inhumanely. And of course, there is also no 
opposition concerning the moral conviction that even ani￾mals may not be treated cruelly.
We cannot maintain the absolute appreciation of our 
own personhood without the absolute appreciation of the 
personhood of other persons. We cannot appreciate the 
personhood of any specifc person as absolute without 
appreciating the personhood of every person as absolute. 
This shows the generalized character of the human dignity 
principle: either we have respect for the human dignity of 
every human person including ourselves, or we have no 
respect for the human dignity of anyone including our￾selves.
Absoluteness means that there is no justifcation to 
prevent someone from determining his own will by his 
own considerations and refections. There is no justifca￾tion of the disregard of one’s own free will. From this 
position, one cannot conclude an absolute respect for a 
person’s free actions. The point of respect of human dig￾nity is, so to speak, not the freedom of action, but the free￾dom of will. When we address freedom of will, we talk 
about human dignity. When we address freedom of action, 
we talk about the fundamental constitutional value of lib￾erty. There is a huge difference between liberty and human 
dignity because respect for liberty is relative while respect 
for human dignity must be absolute.

?Do you Still Remember?
1. Empirical research was introduced in this lesson to 
confrm the thesis that human beings can develop 
and maintain the ability to lead their life on the 
basis of their own free will only if their personhood 
is recognized and appreciated by others. Please 
describe this empirical research using a few key￾words.
2. The equiprimordiality thesis requires that even babies 
or very young children must be capable of recogniz￾ing and appreciating the personhood of others before 
they have developed their own personhood. Is there 
any evidence for this hypothesis?
3. Is there any evidence for the hypothesis that igno￾rance and disregard of the personhood of others 
leads to a weakening, undermining, or even a loss of 
personhood for the agent? Explain the argumenta￾tion in few words.
4. Through the thought experiment “Dignity 
Certifcate,” it is possible to show that it is impossible 
to recognize and to appreciate the dignity of any one 
human person without recognizing and appreciating 
the dignity of every other human person. Explain 
this thought experiment.

The General Structure of a Human Right is the 
Following
v h[ ] as a human right toward x on y of z
v = entities who are endowed with personhood = per￾sons (including proto-persons).
x = entities who are endowed with personhood and 
therefore share the human dignity judgment = persons.
It follows that the original obligors of human rights 
are individual human persons and not the state. The 
state is not endowed with reason and conscience and 
cannot share value judgments. The state is only an 
organization of persons that should produce more 
effectiveness in the recognition and enforcement of 
human rights. Nevertheless, this organization is a very 
powerful and therefore potentially effective and dan￾gerous perpetrator of human rights violations. There￾fore, the state should be considered the addressee of 
human rights in a derivate sense.
y = the specifc action or omission on which v has a 
right. There are three different kinds of relationships: 
(1) right to respect, (2) right to protection, and (3) right 
to support.
Respect = Omission of any kind of injury (taboo￾ization). Unrestricted respect is possible for private per￾sons as well as for the state or other organizations.
Protection = Defending someone against the threats 
of injury by third parties. Protection is possible for pri￾vate persons as well as for the state, but only to a cer￾tain degree that depends on the capacity and the 
resources of the protecting agent. The state has more 
power to provide effective protection than single indi￾viduals.
Derivation of Human Rights from the Principle of 
Human Dignity
The analysis of what is meant by derivation of human 
rights from the principle of human dignity requires the 
analysis of the general structure of a human right and 
the examination of how the particular variables of this 
structure can be derived from the human dignity prin￾ciple as well as how the predicate “having a right” can 
be derived.
124 Chapter 7 · From Human Dignity to Human Rights7
Support = Helping someone escape from inhumane 
living conditions. Support is generally possible for pri￾vate persons to a very low degree. States can overtake 
the task of support to a higher degree (social state).
z  =  the protection scope. From the principle of 
human dignity follows only one protection scope of 
human rights: the freedom of will (authenticity). The 
particular protection scopes of particular human rights 
are only concretizations of the general protection scope 
“authenticity.” Human rights do not refer to the free￾dom of action.
Values and Norms
The derivation of human rights from the principle of 
human dignity requires the derivation of norms from 
values. This seems, at least at frst glance, logically impos￾sible. From the fact that A prefers x does not follow that 
A has a right to x or that B is obliged toward A to x.
Furthermore, values only refer to the person who 
evaluates. Rights refer to a relationship between obligee 
and obligor.
But, according to Immanuel Kant, moral duties are 
duties toward oneself based on an inner coercion. They 
do not require a relationship to other persons. There￾fore, it makes sense to ask whether there is a close rela￾tionship between values and duties that can be 
understood as a relationship of derivation.
Duties
If in a confict between volitions of the frst order and 
volitions of the second order (Harry G. Frankfurt) the 
latter appears to the agent as a mental coercion, then 
the agent considers the volition of the second order an 
duty.
Duties refer to the absolute value of human dignity 
if the second order volition refers to the development 
and/or maintenance of personhood. Duties that refer 
to personhood can be called human duties. So, it can be 
shown that it is possible to derive human duties from 
the value of human dignity.
125
From Human Dignity to Human Rights7
From Human Duties to Human Rights
Considering that personhood has an absolute value 
(dignity) for humans and that there are huge tempta￾tions that drive us to act contrary to our highest prefer￾ences which we consider human duties, we are forced to 
use any available means that can help us avoid acting 
contrary to these duties. One effective means to ensure 
our observance of our human duties is the conferral of 
human rights. By conferring human rights, we subject 
ourselves to the criticism and control of those who are 
the benefciaries of our human duties and the potential 
victims in the event that we breach our duties. A further 
means of ensuring our fulfllment of the duties is the 
transformation of moral human rights into legal 
human rights.
Conferment of Human Rights
The conferment of moral human rights is not a perfor￾mative act in a literal sense. Rather, it is an attitude. 
This attitude is based on a voluntary adoption. There￾fore, we can theoretically decide not to adopt this atti￾tude. Nevertheless, recognizing the absoluteness of our 
human duties while at the same time rejecting the con￾ferment of human rights is irrational.
7.1 What Is a Right?
In the last chapters, I tried to clarify the concept of human 
dignity. So, we are now well prepared for asking how 
exactly human dignity can be considered an adequate 
principle that underlies the foundation of human rights.
To recap, in the fourth chapter we saw how interna￾tional law considers the founding role that human dignity 
plays in human rights (e.g., the preambles of the 
International Covenants of 1966). There, it is assumed 
that human rights are derived from the principle of human 
dignity. Thus, according to international treaties, human 
rights are said to be connected to human dignity by a cer￾tain kind of derivation. In this chapter, we need to clarify 
what can be meant by derivation in this context and 
whether such a derivation connection can be philosophi￾cally justifed. In order to clarify the kind of link between 
126 Chapter 7 · From Human Dignity to Human Rights7
human dignity and human rights, it is frst necessary to 
clarify both concepts that are supposed to be linked. So 
far, we have achieved an appropriate understanding of the 
concept of human dignity. Now, we must analyze the con￾cept of human rights. Consequently, the frst question 
arises: What is a right?
We can display the structure of a right in general and a 
human right in particular by the following way:
v h[ ] as a right toward x on y of z
You see that there are four variables that we have to iden￾tify. Having identifed these variables we can then turn to 
clarifying what is meant by “having a right.”
What is v?
The frst variable v relates to the benefciary of human 
rights. If human rights can be derived from human dig￾nity, then it seems to be clear that the benefciaries of 
human rights are the very same entities to whom we 
ascribe dignity. As we have seen, these are comprised of all 
the entities which are endowed with personhood. Entities 
which are endowed with personhood are called persons. 
Thus far, we have learned that personhood is only a poten￾tial quality of human beings. We can therefore say that 
human dignity relates to every human person. From this 
follows that the benefciaries of human rights are all 
human persons.
It follows that benefciaries of human rights can only 
be persons and not non-persons. Human beings can only 
be benefciaries of human rights if they have the property 
of personhood or, at least, the potential for personhood 
(proto-persons). It is not possible to conclude from the 
principle of human dignity that every human being can be 
considered a benefciary of human rights, particularly for 
those who are neither persons nor have the potential to 
become a person.
As I have already mentioned in the ffth lesson, many 
legal philosophers criticize the thesis I introduce here by 
arguing that a concept of human dignity that is based on 
the absolute evaluation of personhood is unconvincing 
because it does not lead to a conception of human rights 
that protects every human being.
My counterargument against this criticism is that the 
critics confuse the relationship of human dignity with 
human rights. They try to derive the meaning of human 
dignity from a certain idea of human rights instead of 
deriving the meaning of human rights from a certain idea 
Owner of Human 
Rights
Criticism
127
7.1 · What Is a Right?7
of human dignity (e.g., Waldron). The meaning of the 
term human rights depends on the meaning of the term 
human dignity and not the other way around.
The second counterargument is that it is not possible 
to deliver an absolute value judgment in favor of the pure 
human specimen. There is no transcendental argument 
available for such an argumentation. It is not possible to 
show that something else except for personhood can be 
considered to have absolute value.
It is important to stress that the scope of this examina￾tion only concerns the foundation of human rights and 
not the foundation of morality and all its attending prin￾ciples. It might be that there is a moral principle that 
requires a certain kind of respect toward every member of 
the human family. Whatever this principle may be, it is not 
part of human rights because human rights are what we 
can derive from the principle of human dignity and human 
dignity, in turn, only refers to persons.
What is x?
The variable x refers to those from whom the benefcia￾ries can expect to beneft. These are exactly those entities 
that defend the human dignity judgment.
As we have seen, it is not rationally possible to not 
accept the human dignity judgment. Anyone who does not 
share the human dignity judgment would necessarily have 
to abandon ever being in a position to make value judg￾ments. So, whoever is interested in their own personhood 
must also accept the human dignity judgment. Considering 
that all persons are necessarily interested in their own per￾sonhood, all persons must accept the dignity judgment, 
provided that they are rational. From this follows that x 
means every human person.
Some legal philosophers share the opinion that human 
rights are only addressed to states and not to particular 
individuals much less every human person. This opinion 
seems to be confrmed by international law and by many 
national constitutions which only address human rights in 
terms of the state. So, we read in Article 1 German Basic 
Law:
» Human dignity is sacrosanct. To respect and protect it is 
the duties of all state authority.
According to this view, only the state has the duties to 
respect the human rights as opposed to everybody respect￾ing the human rights of everybody else. Nevertheless, 
there are some rare cases of constitutions which make 
Obligor of Human 
Rights
128 Chapter 7 · From Human Dignity to Human Rights7
clear that respecting human dignity is a mutual duties for 
all human beings. I know two examples: namely the con￾stitution of the German state Brandenburg and the 
Constitution of the Republic of Malawi. In Article 12 (IV) 
of the latter we read:
» The inherent dignity and worth of each human being 
requires that the State and all persons shall recognize and 
protect fundamental human rights and afford the fullest 
protection to the rights and views of all individuals, 
groups and minorities whether or not they are entitled to 
vote.
The Constitution of the state of Brandenburg says in 
Article 7 (II):
» Everyone owes everyone the recognition of their dignity.
From the principle of human dignity frst follows that only 
human persons must respect the dignity of others because 
the concept of human dignity refers to a value judgment 
and only persons are capable of making value judgments. 
The state is not included within this meaning of a person. 
It is not a living entity that is endowed with reason and 
conscience. The state is only an idea in our brains, the idea 
of an organization of human individuals. Citizens as well 
as civil servants, judges, or politicians of a state act accord￾ing to an internalized role that is part of the imagined idea 
of the state. The idea that human rights are addressed to 
the state as the obliged entity therefore cannot be derived 
from the principle of human dignity. Rather, the state 
should be considered a means of guaranteeing human 
rights. In order to make sure that every human person 
respects the human dignity and therefore the human rights 
of others, they establish the state as a powerful means and 
give it the task of respecting and protecting the human 
rights of its subjects.
Whether or not the state is obliged to respect and pro￾tect human rights is therefore a matter of positive law. 
From a moral point of view, we can say that a state that 
does not respect human rights is an unjust state. An unjust 
state functions as a means for particular human individu￾als—those who have the power of the state—to violate the 
human rights of others.
What is y?
While discussing the points above, I used the expres￾sion “respect” without any comment. This was only done 
provisionally. We now turn to discussing whether “respect” 
129
7.1 · What Is a Right?7
is the appropriate and suffcient relation between the vari￾able v and the variable x.
One thing is clear: if the personhood of others has 
absolute value for me, then it is a consequence for me to 
respect the personhood of others. Respect is the basic rela￾tion between v and x. V has, in any case, a right toward x 
on (y =) respect.
There are, however, two other kinds of relations imag￾inable: the relation of protection and the relation of pro￾viding aid (support).
Protection not only means that x is supposed to refrain 
from committing any infringement of the human rights of 
v, but also that x is obliged to actively defend and protect 
the human rights of v against threatening violations by 
third parties. The duties to protect, however, cannot be as 
unconditional and without exception as the duties to 
respect. There are some limitations.
The limits of protective activities depend on our capac￾ities. If we are not strong and powerful enough to effec￾tively protect the human rights of others, then we are not 
obliged to do so. Even if we are able to protect a particular 
individual against a particular threat, it is not possible to 
protect everyone who is in need. Our capacities are thus 
further restricted not only by our potential or resources, 
but also the fact that our resources are devoted to more 
than one target. We have to use our time, strength, and 
money not only for the protection of others but also for 
other aims that must be achieved in order to lead one’s 
personal life.
Criminal law distinguishes between affrmative acts 
and acts of omission, and evaluates each differently. 
Whoever violates a legally protected interest through affr￾mative acts always commits the corresponding offense and 
is to be punished for it. Nevertheless, someone who vio￾lates a legally protected interest by failing to act in accor￾dance with a protective commitment is to be punished not 
for the corresponding crime but only for the failure to ren￾der aid, which is a weaker crime. Only in some exceptional 
cases does the law consider the failure to render aid in the 
same manner as if the violation had occurred through an 
affrmative action. Such cases are those that involve a per￾son who has, by law or by contract, obtained the status of 
guarantor of a certain outcome. On the level of morality, 
we must also distinguish these two cases. Only in some 
exceptional cases do we consider an omission as being of 
the same quality as an affrmative act. In the other cases, it 
Respect
Protection
130 Chapter 7 · From Human Dignity to Human Rights7
is a question of appropriateness and reasonableness 
whether and to what extent we are obliged to protect.
Finally, the consequence of protection is limited to 
those means which are compatible with human rights. The 
absolute appreciation of the personhood of others does 
not lead to the consequence that one should protect the 
human rights of others by violating the human rights (of 
third parties).
In order to relieve citizens of the duties to render aid 
and to make the provision of aid as effective as possible, it 
is a good idea to transfer the task of protecting human 
rights to the state. Accordingly, the state is the means of 
effectively protecting human rights. Nevertheless, the 
duties of the state to protect human rights is limited as 
well. The duties to protect human rights is limited by the 
borders of the state and by the effective sphere of control. 
Another limitation is grounded in the restricted personal 
and fnancial resources of the state.
The scope and limitations of the state’s duties to pro￾tect human rights cannot be defned with precision through 
philosophical means. The duties and their defned limits 
are a matter of positive law. Neither can be derived from 
the principle of human dignity.
What is true for the protection of human rights against 
threats from third parties is also true with regard to the 
question of whether and to what extent individuals or the 
state are obliged to help persons who live under inhumane 
conditions that are caused by general living conditions as 
opposed to the malicious acts of third parties. This is also 
a question whose answer cannot be derived solely from the 
principle of human dignity. Here, too, the limits of capa￾bilities, potential, and the multitude of targets are taken 
into account.
So, from a purely moral point of view we can conclude 
that there is only a right to respect the personhood of the 
owner of the right while the protection of human rights 
against threats by third parties or the provision of aid to 
escape inhumane living conditions depend on complex 
empirical conditions that can only be addressed through 
positive law.
What is z?
The variable z refers to the content of the right. Within 
this feld, derivation from the human dignity principle 
plays the crucial role. Derivation from the human dignity 
principle leads to the result that human rights are exactly 
those rights which are supposed to protect the status of a 
Aid

7.1 · What Is a Right?7
person as person. Human rights protect personhood. 
Personhood is the ability to lead one’s own life on the basis 
of authenticity. Authenticity is what we can call free will. 
Free will is based on one’s own considerations and refec￾tions and free from all kinds of manipulation.
It is important to stress that the function of human 
rights is neither to establish equality nor to protect the 
individual’s freedom of action. Thus, we must distinguish 
between freedom of action and freedom of will. It is only 
possible to derive from the human dignity principle rights 
that protect the freedom of will, while the same is not nec￾essarily true for freedom of action. From where does this 
difference arise?
Freedom of action is a person’s freedom to do what￾ever they want to do. Limits to freedom of action are lim￾its to external behavior. In principle, a limitation on the 
freedom of action does not infringe on personhood. 
Freedom of action is not a matter of human rights. It is a 
matter of another legal principle, namely the liberty prin￾ciple. I will come back to this principle in the 18th chapter.
Comparatively, freedom of will is what matters in the 
context of human rights. The crucially important distinc￾tion between freedom of will and the freedom of action is, 
unfortunately, very seldomly refected in human rights 
doctrine as well as in human rights case law. It is very nec￾essary to keep this distinction in mind because the conse￾quences are profound. Considering that freedom of will is 
the essence of personhood and that personhood is of 
absolute value, freedom of will is also of absolute value 
that is to be respected as such. Therefore, human rights are 
rights that protect freedom of will as an absolute. It is not 
possible to balance one human right against another or to 
balance human rights against any public interest. It is also 
not possible to reduce the protection scope of human 
rights in favor of any public or private interest that refers 
to equality, freedom of action, or any other task.
It may sound strange to hear that human rights cannot 
be restricted or repealed. We have seen in the frst chapter 
that many codifed human rights contain clauses accord￾ing to which it is legally permitted to reduce their applica￾bility, e.g., for the sake of public security or public order, 
health, public morality, etc. I do not say that these clauses 
are not legitimate. Nevertheless, I claim that they cannot 
be interpreted as a basis to reduce the scope of the human 
right in question. I will come back to this point later in the 
ninth chapter.
132 Chapter 7 · From Human Dignity to Human Rights7
For now, I want to go back to the question of the status 
that is protected by human rights. I have said that this sta￾tus is the status of personhood. So, we may conclude that 
there is only one human right. That is the human right to 
personhood. It means that every individual who is 
endowed with at least the potential to develop personhood 
is entitled to demand respect and, within certain limits, 
protection or support for the development and mainte￾nance of personhood.
Nevertheless, when we talk about human rights, we do 
not talk about one single human right but rather an entire 
collection of different human rights. This multitude of 
human rights comes from the fact that personhood can be 
threatened in very different ways. It is a matter of history 
what kind of threat occurs in a particular time and under 
what particular circumstances. The different human rights 
correspond to different threats of personhood. The part 
of a human right that denotes the particular threat at 
which it is aimed at is called the protection scope of the 
human right in question. Human rights differ from each 
other according to the differences in their protection 
scopes. But all these protection scopes defne only differ￾ent kinds of threats against the same fundamental good, 
namely, the personhood of the human person.
Now, we can fll the variables of our structure with spe￾cifc content.
Every human person [has a right toward] every other 
human person and toward the state on respect (or protec￾tion) of their personhood.
7.2 What Is Meant by Having a Right?
One part of the structure remains open: What is meant by 
having a right?—The American legal philosopher Wesley 
Newcomb Hohfeld analyzed the concept “right” by 
observing how this concept is used in legal articles and 
judicial decisions. He came to the result that the concept 
“right” embraces four different meanings. He distin￾guished privileges, claims, powers, and immunities. Most 
legal philosophers do not use the term privileges but prefer 
to speak of liberties. Hohfeld’s distinctions apply for legal 
rights as well as for moral rights.
A liberty is simply the absence of any contrary duties: 
P has the liberty to drink wine before dinner if there is no 
binding rule that prohibits drinking wine before dinner.
Hohfeld’s Analysis
133
7.2 · What Is Meant by Having a Right?7
A claim is the logical correlative of the corresponding 
duties of another party. P has a claim against Q to do x, if 
Q has the duties toward P to do x.
A power is the ability to bring about some change in the 
legal or moral situation of oneself and of others by per￾forming some performative actions, for example, saying 
“Here, this is yours!”
An immunity is the correlative of the absence of any 
legal or moral power of another party. So, you have immu￾nity from losing your ownership by any unilateral act of 
another party, such as by grabbing your book and saying 
“This is mine now!”
A legal right consists of not only one of these positions 
but rather several of them. The owner of the human right 
to free speech has the liberty to express his opinion because 
he does not have a duties to keep silent. He also has the 
liberty to keep silent because he does not have a duties to 
speak. At the same time, he also has a claim against any 
other person to tolerate his speech or his silence because 
any third party has the duties to tolerate his speech or his 
silence. The right to free speech also embraces an immu￾nity because no one else has the right to restrict the for￾mer’s right by performing a certain legal act. The right to 
free speech is not connected with a power because it does 
not embrace the power to change the legal position of 
oneself or of others.
Altogether, we can say that having a right means having 
dominion over some core position in any confrontation 
with one or more other parties. Or, in other words:
Having a right is the potency of the person in question 
to compel those who have an duties toward that person to 
do something or to refrain from doing something.
In the case of a legal right, the holder of the right can 
force the obligor by means of public power or physical 
force. In the case of a moral right, the holder of the right 
can force the obligor only by appealing to his conscience 
or by means of public accusations that damage the obli￾gor’s public reputation. These means may be less effective. 
But effectiveness is not a required condition for having a 
moral right. Although it is possible to violate a right by 
acting against it, this does not entail that the right itself 
fades away because of its violation. In a society of mas￾ters and slaves, the right to freedom from slavery is con￾tinuously violated by the masters. Nevertheless, we can 
say that the slaves have a moral right to be liberated. For 
we are convinced that the masters should be forced by 
134 Chapter 7 · From Human Dignity to Human Rights7
their conscience to liberate the slaves and we think that 
everybody should be outraged about slavery. It therefore 
makes sense to recognize not only legal, but also moral 
rights.
7.3 Deriving Duties from Values
Rights always relate to duties. Where there is someone 
who has a right, there must also be someone else who has 
a corresponding duties. Duties and rights are normative 
sentences. Normative sentences say what we ought to do. 
Doing something because of an duties is different from 
doing something because of a preference. From this 
point it becomes clear that at frst glance it is hardly pos￾sible to derive human rights of human dignity. Human 
dignity is the name of a value judgment and value judg￾ments say what a person prefers. What a person prefers is 
what she wants. Comparatively, rights are norms and 
norms say what a person ought to do. The former refers 
to will, while the latter refers to duties. It is obvious that 
there is no direct possibility of deriving rights from val￾ues.
This aspect is very often overlooked in philosophical 
discussion. Many legal philosophers think that it is not 
problematic to derive human rights from the principle of 
human dignity. The reason for their mistake is the continu￾ing infuence of the traditional natural law approach. 
According to natural law, values are part of the objective 
reality and they are, so to say, inherently connected to cor￾responding duties and rights. But if we follow the subjec￾tive theory of value as I did in the second chapter of this 
book, then there is a categorical gap between values and 
norms and we need a deeper analysis of the concept of 
duties and rights in order to fnd a bridge that could con￾nect them with the value of human dignity.
I do not know a way that directly leads from values to 
rights. Nevertheless, I think it is possible to show that there 
is a direct way from values to duties. I will try to show that 
duties are in fact a certain kind of wish or preference. If 
my argument is convincing, then we have a bridge from 
values to duties because both belong to the same family. 
Contrary to frst glance, values and duties do not belong 
to different categories between which there is an insur￾mountable gap. Rather, values and duties belong to the 
same category, namely to the category of values. I have to 
135
7.3 · Deriving Duties from Values7
stress that I argue on an ethical level and not on a juridical 
one. That should always be kept in mind.
I start my argumentation with Immanuel Kant. Kant 
defned the concept of duties as something that coerces 
our will. Kant distinguished between an internal and an 
external coercion. An duties that is based on an external 
coercion is an duties toward other persons and is called a 
legal or juridical duties. An duties that is based on internal 
coercion is an duties toward oneself and is called a moral 
duties.
According to Kant, for example, it is an external coer￾cion if I have to pay a fne because I have exceeded the 
speed limit. Therefore, he would conclude that the duties 
to comply with the permitted speed is based on an external 
coercion. A deeper consideration shows that external 
coercion can never establish an duties. The fne or the 
threat of fnes can never coerce my free will. The fne is 
only a good argument in favor of the idea that I may com￾ply with the permitted speed. Nevertheless, good argu￾ments do not coerce our will. In fact, a will that is based on 
nothing but good arguments is not a coerced will, but 
rather a free will. This is indeed the defnition of the free￾dom of will—that it is based on nothing but good argu￾ments.
One could possibly speak about an external coercion 
of the will when it comes to torture. But torture does not 
coerce the will. It destroys it. Someone who, for example, 
commits a betrayal under torture cannot be held respon￾sible. For his betrayal is not based on his own will, but on 
the will of another—someone under torture behaves like a 
machine and does not act like a person. These consider￾ations show that coercion of the will can neither mean the 
destruction of the will nor the determination of the will by 
arguments.
It only makes sense to speak of a compulsion of will if 
we, in a certain sense, do not agree with our own will. This is 
the case when we wish to act in some way, while at the same 
time wishing to not act according the frst wish. In such a 
paradox, two opposing wills fght against each other. We can 
say that we do not wish what we wish. We do not want what 
we want. We feel a contradiction inside our own will.
The American philosopher Harry Gordon Frankfurt 
has proposed to solve this paradox of will by distinguish￾ing between two different levels or orders of will, namely 
the so-called volitions of the frst order and the volitions 
of the second order.
Kant’s Concept of 
Duties
H.G. Frankfurt’s 
Conception of 
Different Orders of 
Volitions
136 Chapter 7 · From Human Dignity to Human Rights7
Volitions of the frst order are our ordinary wishes and 
desires. They arise spontaneously and disappear when 
they are satisfed or when another new desire arises and 
displaces the former. These volitions of the frst order fol￾low each other. There is no confict between them.
I will demonstrate the nature of volitions of the frst 
order and its relation to volitions of the second order in a 
simple example that has nothing to do with morality or 
with human rights. Let’s say that I’m hungry and I go to a 
bakery to buy a cheese sandwich. The wish to buy and eat 
a cheese sandwich is a volition of the frst order. But at the 
counter, I see a ham sandwich and now I feel the desire for 
a ham sandwich. This is also a desire of the frst order. 
What will happen? The desire for the cheese sandwich dis￾appears. It is replaced by the desire for the ham sandwich. 
There is no confict between the two wishes.
It becomes more problematic if our volition of the frst 
order meets a volition of the second order. Volitions of the 
second order refer to a wish that seeks for the wish of frst 
order to not become realized. For example, in the morning 
I stand on the scales and fnd that I have gained weight. As 
I prefer to lose weight, I choose—while staying on the 
scales—to go without the sandwich today. This is a second 
order volition. It does not happen spontaneously, but due 
to my own consideration. It is the result of my own appro￾priate decision. It says nothing about my current needs, 
desires and passions, but something about how I want to 
lead my life. At noon I am hungry. I pass the bakery and 
see the delicious cheese sandwiches. I feel a volition of frst 
order to buy and eat that sandwich. But there is a confict 
between this volition and my volition of the second order 
from this morning. The volition of second order does not 
simply disappear. It is still there. Both volitions stand in 
confict. The volition of second order cannot be displaced 
by the volition of frst order because they are not on the 
same level. The wish of the frst order has something to do 
with my hunger, the wish of the second order has some￾thing to do with the way I want to lead my life. It is not 
about pleasure versus pleasure, desire versus desire or 
hunger versus hunger, but rather about autonomy versus 
hunger and those are two things that cannot be exchanged. 
If I decide against the sandwich in this situation, I will feel 
an uncomfortable feeling, namely a certain pain of depri￾vation, which also causes a certain sadness. Somehow, I 
feel frustrated. Nevertheless, this feeling occurs alongside 
a certain feeling of proudness because I withstood the 
Shame as Coercion
137
7.3 · Deriving Duties from Values7
temptation. But what will happen if I decide in favor of 
the cheese sandwich and against fasting? I am showing 
myself that I am guided by my drives, instincts, and desires, 
and not by my own reasonable decision. This is, however, 
not compatible with my self-esteem. My self-esteem is 
essentially based on my belief in my capacity of self￾control and autonomy. Therefore, the self-inficted loss of 
self-control leads to a loss of self-esteem or, in other words, 
to a self-devaluation. We regard this as a self-humiliation. 
We have a special word for this sense of self-humiliation 
and self-devaluation. We call it shame. The feeling of 
shame is much more painful than frustration because the 
former arises out of a deprivation of a second order voli￾tion, while frustration does not affect our self-worth as 
persons. The feeling of shame is very cruel and painful. 
This is why we regard the threat of shame as a power of 
coercion. In order to avoid shame, I feel coerced to choose 
fasting and to renounce the sandwich. In a confict between 
strong volitions of the frst order and strong volitions of 
the second order, we feel a kind of coercion that we can 
call duties.
Nevertheless, there is usually also another way to avoid 
shame. We can change our life plans, i.e., the way that we 
want to live. I can give up the plan to lose weight. Now I 
no longer need to fast and feel shame when I eat a tempt￾ing cheese sandwich. However, the possibility of giving up 
second order volitions does not work when it comes to 
absolute volitions of the second order. In such a situation, 
it is not possible to give up such volitions because it is in 
those very volitions that our absolute preference in favor 
of personhood is contained. We cannot give up this pref￾erence without suffering great damage to our own person￾hood. I have shown this in the last chapter.
So, we have shown that the absolute value of person￾hood mutates to a human duties if we are confronted with 
the temptation to ignore or to disregard the personhood 
of others. I think this is a convincing argumentation in 
order to show the possibility of deriving human duties 
from the principle of human dignity.
7.4 Deriving Rights from Duties
But how can we move from human duties to human 
rights? What I have shown so far is only that the principle 
of human dignity can function as a starting point from 
138 Chapter 7 · From Human Dignity to Human Rights7
which we can derive duties toward ourselves. Duties 
toward oneself do not alter the moral position of others. 
So, we need another bridge that leads from the human 
duties toward ourselves to the human rights of others 
toward us. I think this bridge can be constructed in the 
following way.
As we have seen before, we are threatened with feelings 
of shame if we violate our human duties toward ourselves. 
But in practice, it is very easy to avoid this result by replac￾ing it with strategies of displacement as we have seen in the 
last chapter. So, there is a huge risk that we may fail in 
meeting our human duties. We therefore need strong 
mechanisms of control. Conferring rights to those who 
are the benefciaries of our human duties toward ourselves 
is a suffcient mechanism of control.
The conferment of human rights to our fellow humans 
has two important aspects: (1) we transform the duties 
toward ourselves into duties toward others; and (2) by 
conferring rights, we subject ourselves to the judgment of 
those who are concerned with acts that disregard their per￾sonhood. Conferring a right means to subject oneself to 
the criticism and sanctions of possible victims that may be 
betrayed by our possible violations of human duties. We 
give them control over us and let ourselves be guided by 
them.
Human rights are thus comparable to the mast to 
which Odysseus was chained to as he passed the island of 
the Sirens with his companions. He let himself be tied to 
the mast to be protected against the seduction of the songs 
of the Sirens, who otherwise would have tempted him 
onto their island so that he could crash into the cliffs. 
Human rights, like the mast of Odysseus, are a tool that 
can protect us against our selfsh and ruthless desires in 
the face of numerous temptations. Human rights help us 
to not violate our mutual human duties that we have 
imposed upon ourselves.
It is up to us whether we confer human rights. But 
because human dignity is the highest and most important 
value for every person, every person has an interest in 
making sure that a violation of human rights does not 
occur. Therefore, we are forced by rationality to confer 
human rights. It is irrational to respect human dignity 
while at the same time refusing to confer human rights. 
For respecting human dignity means to confer human 
rights to those who are endowed with personhood. We can 
therefore assume that everyone who has a sense of human 
Conferment of Rights
Odysseus’ Mast
139
7.4 · Deriving Rights from Duties7
dignity has, at the same time, a sense for moral human 
rights. Accordingly, we can say that human rights can be 
derived from human dignity.
?Do you Still Remember?
1. What is the general structure of a right?
2. What is an duties according to Immanuel Kant?
3. The derivation of human rights from the principle of 
human dignity is problematic because human dignity 
refers to a value while human rights refer to norms. 
Under Harry G. Frankfurt, however, it is possible to 
derive duties from values. Explain the argumentation 
in few words.
4. Human rights are based on an attitude that can theo￾retically be understood as a permanent act of confer￾ring: human beings are the holders of human rights 
because rational human beings confer each other 
human rights. What can be considered as a reason 
behind this act of conferring?
For the answers, see 7 Chap. 21.

The Ban on Inhuman/Degrading/Cruel Treatment
The codifed rights to physical and mental integrity are 
very vaguely formulated. The international human 
rights codifcations speak of prohibition of torture and 
inhuman, degrading, and cruel treatment (e.g., Article 
5 UDHR, Article 3 ECHR, Articles 1 and 16 CAT, 
etc.). By way of a thorough philosophical and empiri￾cal analysis, these norms can be interpreted as follows:
This right refers to the violation of personhood 
through physical and mental cruelty. There is no differ￾ence between “inhuman” and “degrading” treatment. 
They are synonyms. Both refer to treatment that results 
in a violation of personhood. However, this is the char￾acteristic of any human right. What makes the right in 
question special is the word “cruel,” which, however, is 
not mentioned in Article 3 ECHR. An act is cruel if it 
inficts severe physical or mental pain or suffering.
Cruelty leads to a violation of personhood in that 
the mistreatment of the body and/or psyche results in a 
comprehensive loss of control and thus a loss of belief 
in one’s own self-effcacy. This implies the belief of 
being worthless as a person and the willingness to sub￾mit to the will of others.
In very extreme cases, cruel treatment can lead to 
what psychologists call Dissociative Identity Disorder, 
which is the complete alienation of a person from their 
own physical identity (one’s body is perceived as some￾how alien).
Not every interference with the physical integrity of 
a person falls within the scope of protection of this 
human right. For example, compulsory vaccination is 
an interference with bodily integrity that does not con￾stitute a violation of human rights. This is because 
compulsory vaccination does not affect the personhood 
of the person concerned.
Four Groups of Human Rights
There are four groups of classic human rights:
1. Rights concerning the protection of physical and 
mental integrity.
2. Rights concerning the protection of intellectual 
integrity.
3. Rights concerning the protection of privacy.
4. The right concerning the protection of life.
142 Chapter 8 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Physical and Mental Integrity8
8.1 The Multitude of Human Rights
In the last lesson, we analyzed the general structure of 
human rights. One important element of every human 
right is the protection scope. The scope of protection is 
what can be derived directly from the principle of human 
dignity. Every single protection scope refers to a certain 
threat to the personhood of human persons. The entirety 
of the scopes of protection illuminates certain aspects of 
personhood. So, we can say that the sum of all the scopes 
of protection of human rights forms a concretization of 
the concept of personhood. Deriving human rights from 
human dignity is a logical operation that consists of mov￾ing logically from a general term (personhood) to specifc 
terms. Or, we can say that the scope of protection is an 
isolation of a certain particular aspect of the general term 
personhood.
In this chapter and in the following fve chapters, I will 
show you this close connection between human dignity 
and human rights by analyzing some rights according to 
how they protect personhood. In general, we can distin￾guish four groups of human rights:
1. Rights concerning the protection of physical and men￾tal integrity.
2. Rights concerning the protection of intellectual integ￾rity.
3. Rights concerning the protection of privacy.
4. The right concerning the protection of life.
The Ban on Torture
Torture is intentional cruelty. It is the paradigm of a 
cruel act.
Case Law
The interpretation of Article 3 of the ECHR by the 
European Commission of Human Rights (in the Greek 
Case of 1969) and by the European Court of Human 
Rights (Ireland v. UK of 1978) is – compared with the 
philosophical analysis – very confusing and hardly con￾vincing. This demonstrates the usefulness of a philo￾sophical analysis.

8.2 The Ban on Inhuman/Degrading/Cruel 
Treatment and Torture in International 
Law
In this lesson, I want to take a closer look at the rights 
concerning the protection of physical and mental integ￾rity. The international human rights treaties codify these 
rights through very nebulous and unclear wording. The 
keywords are torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, 
and cruelty (among others: Articles 5 UDHR, Article 7 
ICCPR, and Article 3 ECHR). I will discuss this human 
right using the example of Article 3 ECHR (see . Fig. 8.1).
The rights concerning the protection of physical and 
mental integrity also include the prohibition of slavery 
and servitude (Art. 8 ICCPR; Art. 4 ECHR). However, I 
will not go into these rights in detail. For this, please refer 
to the recommended reading.
A frst look at the words “inhuman and degrading” 
may trigger certain representations and images in our 
head, so that we get a rough idea of what might be meant. 
However, a closer examination shows that it is diffcult to 
defne these terms.
It seems much easier to understand what is meant by 
torture. This is particularly the case because we have a 
legal defnition of torture – not in the ECHR, but in the 
framework of the human rights regulations.
Article 1 of the UN Convention against Torture and 
other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and 
Punishment (CAT), adopted and opened for signature, 
ratifcation, and accession by General Assembly on 10 
December 1984, defnes torture according to four elements 
(see . Fig. 8.2). These elements are:
5 Severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental,
5 Intentionally inficted,
5 For purposes (obtaining information, punishing, etc.),
5 Where a public offcial is directly or indirectly respon￾sible.

Torture
Slavery
144 Chapter 8 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Physical and Mental Integrity8
. Fig. 8.2 Article 1 CAT
. Fig. 8.3 Article 16 (1) CAT
Although the Convention does not contain a specifc def￾nition for the meaning of “inhuman and degrading treat￾ment”, it nevertheless provides a hint. According to Article 
16 CAT (see . Fig. 8.3) there are:
5 Other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
which do not amount to torture
5 When such acts are committed [under the control] of a 
public offcial.
The defning characteristic of “public offcial” is negligi￾ble. It does not form part of the term “torture” or the term 
“inhuman and degrading treatment,” and instead only 
functions to limit the obligations under the UN Convention 
against Torture to certain cases of torture and inhuman 
and degrading treatment, namely where the state and its 
offcials are responsible. Article 3 ECHR does not have 
this limitation.

From the word “other” in Article 16 (1) CAT we note 
that torture is a kind of cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
treatment. “Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment” is, 
so to speak, the generic term while “torture” is one of its 
sub-terms. Torture is a special type of cruel, inhuman, and 
degrading treatment. The difference between torture and 
other cruel, inhuman, or degrading acts is not entirely 
clear. First, it may be seen in the fact that torture requires 
an intention, whereas other cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
acts may be committed without intention. Secondly, it 
could be part of the conceptual characteristics of torture 
that it is always carried out for specifc purposes, whereas 
no specifc purpose is required for another cruel, inhuman, 
or degrading act. However, the defnition of torture in 
Article 1 CAT mentions specifc ends only by way of 
example. According to this defnition, torture is an act by 
which severe pain and suffering are inficted  - whether 
without reason or for any reason whatsoever, for example 
to achieve certain ends.
8.3 Philosophical Analysis
Both the CAT and the ECHR leave the question of what 
the difference is between “inhuman” and “degrading” 
treatment unanswered. Furthermore, the CAT provides a 
third distinction, namely “cruel,” which is also contained 
in the UDHR as well as in the ICCPR, but not in the 
ECHR. So, it is obviously necessary to analyze the words 
“inhuman” and “degrading” as well as “cruel” through a 
philosophical analysis of language. First, what is meant by 
“inhuman”? My approach to the term “inhuman” consists 
of four steps.
1. The frst statement we can make is that “inhuman” is 
obviously the negation of “human” like “invisible” is 
the negation of “visible.” Therefore, it seems reason￾able to frst ask what is meant by human treatment.
2. A frst, but obviously false interpretation could con￾sider the word “human” as an adjective of treatment 
that informs us about the fact that the treatment is 
committed by a human being. A human treatment in 
this meaning is a treatment committed by a human 
being like a divine treatment is a treatment committed 
by God. An inhuman treatment is then a treatment that 
is committed by a non-human living entity. Nevertheless, 
“Inhuman”
146 Chapter 8 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Physical and Mental Integrity8
the word “inhuman” cannot be understood in this way. 
There is no entity in the world that can commit an 
inhuman treatment except for human beings.
3. A second interpretation recognizes the adjective “inhu￾man” not as a qualifcation of the word “treatment” 
regarding the agent of the treatment, but regarding the 
object of the treatment, namely the recipients of the 
treatment. An inhuman treatment in this meaning 
would thus transform a human being into a non-human 
being.
How is it possible to transform a human being into 
a non-human being? A human being is, by defnition, a 
living entity. Transforming a human being into some￾thing else can therefore mean to kill him. The dead 
body of a human being is not a human being anymore 
because it is not a living entity. It is a non-human entity. 
Nevertheless, the term “inhuman treatment” may not 
amount to killing of a human being. Someone who suf￾fers from being subjected to inhuman treatment is still 
alive. Thus, the transformation of a human being into 
a non-human being must lead to other results.
4. A convincing interpretation seems to be that “human” 
or “inhuman” is meant in an emphatic sense. In this 
emphatic sense, “human” is not just merely a human 
being, i.e., a specimen of the human species, but a per￾son. A treatment is thus “inhuman” if it leads to the 
result that a human being is deprived of their person￾hood.
Let us move to the concept of “degrading.” What is meant 
by a “degrading” treatment? My approach to the term 
“degrading” also consists of four steps.
1. According to its literal meaning, “degrading” means to 
remove someone from a relatively high grade or rank to 
a lower grade or rank. The concept leaves the objective 
quality of the higher and lower rank open. For exam￾ple, if a politician has the rank of prime minister and 
after the elections he serves in the next cabinet as a min￾ister, we could say that he has been degraded. If a free 
man is captured and made a slave, he too has been 
degraded. Nevertheless, it is obvious that there is a 
huge difference between these two cases. The term 
“degrading” is therefore very vague.
2. Still further, an appropriate understanding of what is 
meant by “degradation” can be achieved if we consider 
“Degrading”
147
8.3 · Philosophical Analysis8
that there is another word that functions in some cases 
as a synonym for degradation. This is the word “humil￾iation.” Humiliation comes from the Latin word 
“humus” which means “soil.” A treatment is humiliat￾ing and, in this sense degrading, when it brings some￾body down to the soil. What does this mean exactly?
3. We must consider that it is a standard pattern in the 
intellectual history of mankind to distinguish human 
beings from other kinds of living entities through the 
attribute of being upright. Being upright means living 
at a distance from the soil. To bring a human being 
back down to the soil thus means to reduce that very 
distance. Accordingly, humiliation means to deprive 
someone of the “human” distance between himself and 
the soils, to transform him, so to speak, into a mere 
worm that crawls through the soil.
4. The distance from the ground, the upright walk, is only 
an image for what actually makes the difference 
between humans and other living beings, namely the 
personhood. To humiliate someone, that is, to fgura￾tively bring them to the ground, therefore actually 
means to deprive them of their personhood.
The language analysis of the notions “inhuman” and 
“degrading” shows that there is no difference between 
their respective meanings. The meaning of both is “to 
deprive someone of their personhood.” Nevertheless, 
“deprivation of personhood” is not an appropriate protec￾tion scope of a particular human right, because it is the 
general protection scope of all human rights and does not 
mark the difference between them. So, the question of 
what special threat to personhood should be covered by 
the particular right to freedom from inhuman/degrading 
treatment remains open.
Here, it is useful to recall the attribute “cruel” that we 
fnd in Article 16 CAT as well as in Article 5 UDHR and 
Article 7 ICCPR. Cruelty should not be understood as an 
alternative to inhuman/degrading, but rather as the spe￾cifc characterization of the kind of inhumanity/degrada￾tion that is addressed in this particular human right 
(although it is not mentioned in Article 3 ECHR). Thus, 
the above-mentioned norms are concerned with the pro￾tection against damage to personhood through cruelty. In 
this context, cruelty is to be understood as defned in 
Article 1 CAT, namely as an intentional act by which 
severe physical or mental pain or suffering is inficted.
“Cruel”
148 Chapter 8 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Physical and Mental Integrity8
But now the crucial question arises – how can cruelty 
deprive someone of their personhood? It seems that cru￾elty, by defnition, refers to the body and mentality (the 
feelings) of human beings, but not their capacity to create 
a free will based on their own considerations and refec￾tions. In many societies, we tolerate cruelty to large extents, 
but very often people are not aware that it is depriving 
others of their personhood. For example, until very 
recently, beating children was broadly understood 
throughout the world as a common means of education. 
Nobody thought that there was anything wrong with beat￾ing a child so long as the beating could be considered 
moderate.
It is interesting to note what Pope Francis said about 
this subject to an audience on 4 February 2015 in Rome. 
He referred to a father who had said, “I sometimes have to 
smack my children a bit, but never in the face so as to not 
humiliate them.” The pope then praised the father for 
respecting his children’s “dignity” by not beating them in 
the face or humiliating them. “He knows the sense of dig￾nity!” said the Pope. “He has to punish them but does it 
justly and moves on.” Many commentators and large parts 
of the public in Germany and elsewhere were shocked and 
outraged. According to German civil law, beating a child 
is strictly forbidden. Section 1631 (2) BGB (Civil Code) 
reads:
» Children have a right to [a] non-violent upbringing. 
Physical punishment, mental injuries and other degrad￾ing actions are prohibited.
Nevertheless, this rule was only introduced in the year 
2000. I suppose that the Pope would not dispute this rule. 
However, he may argue, that a moderate beating that does 
not break bones, damages organs, bursts skin, or leaves 
visible bruises does not violate the body of the child and 
cannot be considered violence so long as the beating is not 
directed at the face. The example shows that our percep￾tion of cruelty is different and depends on how we correlate 
assaults to the body with the deprivation of personhood.
How can intervening with the physical integrity of a 
person lead to a deprivation of personhood? The graphic 
The Circle of Deprivation of Personhood explains this phe￾nomenon (see . Fig. 8.4). Hurting the body can damage 
the personhood when it deprives the individual of their 
awareness of and control over their own body. Our aware￾ness that we are the authors of our own life, capable of 
Physical Violence

8.3 · Philosophical Analysis8
. Fig. 8.4 The circle of deprivation of personhood. (© Sophie Rein￾isch)
producing a free will on the basis of our own consider￾ations and refections, depends on the feedback of our 
body. We manifest our will by making a decision and 
transferring such to the appropriate physical activity. The 
body, in turn, reports back that it has received the com￾mand of the will and that it is acting in accordance with 
the will. From this report the will learns, so to speak, that 
it is effective. This awareness of effectiveness confrms the 
awareness of being the source of one’s own actions. It con￾frms the feeling of authenticity and encourages the indi￾vidual to continue their attempts to lead a life of 
authenticity.
Losing control over the body disconnects this mutual 
stream of information between will and body. From the 
viewpoint of one’s consciousness, the disconnected body 
is perceived as being far from oneself and being strange to 
oneself. The will loses trust in its own effectiveness and the 
individual consequently loses motivation and eventually 
the ability to create its own free will. This progression ends 
with the termination of personhood.
In very extreme cases, this development results in what 
psychologists call the Dissociative Identity Disorder, which 
consists of a complete alienation of the self from its own 
physical identity. Nevertheless, this is only the most 
extreme possibility. But even in less extreme cases, physical 
150 Chapter 8 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Physical and Mental Integrity8
violence can degrade and, eventually, permanently dam￾age the relationship between will and body, thus ultimately 
causing an impairment to and reduction of personhood. 
Even in those situations where we cannot say that person￾hood has almost completely or completely disappeared, 
this injury is a serious disregard of personhood and 
requires protection through human rights.
It is not only physical violence that leads to damage to 
personhood. Such may also be achieved through the infic￾tion of mental pain and suffering. Interventions with the 
mental integrity of a person affect the feeling of control 
over the body by injecting the belief that the person has 
lost all control. Interventions with mental integrity lead a 
person to a deep disregard and mistrust of oneself as well 
as a willingness to subject oneself to the will of another. 
Examples of this kind of violence include mock execu￾tions, water boarding, or a forced choice between one’s 
own children, one of whom is (actually or feignedly) to be 
killed. This state of disregard for oneself can be a side￾effect of the deprivation of physical control.
Let me give you an example. In many Islamic coun￾tries, women are exposed to a severe grade of disregard 
through propaganda and, even, a non-violate oppression. 
Until recently, women in Saudi Arabia were prohibited 
from driving a car or choosing a profession. For every 
decision concerning their own life plans, they needed the 
permission of a man. This general atmosphere of disre￾gard and contempt for women, which religion continues to 
justify, makes women believe that they have far less worth 
than men. This worthlessness relates to the capacity of 
women to lead their own life. It makes them believe that 
they cannot lead their lives on the basis of their own free 
will based on their own considerations and refections. 
Women thus lose the feeling of appreciation and trust in 
their own judgment. They are therefore willing to subject 
themselves to the will of another. Impairing the conscious￾ness of these women so that they come to believe that they 
are not someone but only something is a very extreme case 
of cruelty through mental interventions.
Another extreme example is shown in the picture below 
(see . Fig. 8.5). It shows Jews in Vienna who were forced 
to clean the street with their hands, toothbrushes, and 
similar things when Hitler occupied Austria in 1938. This 
treatment is a good example of a violation of the mental 
integrity without any direct physical injury. Forcing a per￾son to do completely ineffective and senseless work leads

Torture
the person to believe that their life, their will, and any 
attempt to create a meaningful life is worthless. 
Nevertheless, forcing someone to clean a street in Vienna 
for some hours may not have caused them to lose their 
consciousness of personhood through this single event. 
But the permanent continuation of this type of measures 
increasingly destabilizes the self-esteem of a person until it 
eventually leads to the loss of personhood. This is why 
every single act of cruel treatment is to be considered a 
violation of the human right to physical and mental integ￾rity.
I hope to have shown that cruel treatment through 
physical or mental interventions establishes a huge risk of 
loss of personhood. So how does torture relate to cruel 
treatment? It makes no sense to distinguish between cruel 
treatment and torture. Indeed, the distinguishing criteria 
applied by the Commission on Human Rights or by the 
ECtHR are irrelevant. It does not matter whether the cruel 
treatment or torture is intentional or merely negligent – it 
is forbidden in any case. Nor does it matter whether the 
cruel treatment or torture pursues specifc ends. Both cri￾teria of distinction are completely irrelevant regarding the 
danger to personhood created by cruel treatment, be it 
torture or not. The mention of torture in the relevant 
152 Chapter 8 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Physical and Mental Integrity8

Freedom of the person shall be inviolable. These rights may be
interfered with only pursuant to a law. 
. Fig. 8.6 Article 2 (2) GG
norms of international law serves only the function of 
providing a vivid example of what is meant by cruel, inhu￾man, and degrading treatment. This is particularly impor￾tant for the interpretation of Article 3 ECHR, because the 
characteristic of cruelty is not mentioned there. Only the 
reference to torture reveals what is at stake, namely the 
prohibition of cruel treatment.
The philosophical analysis also shows that not every 
interference with bodily integrity is relevant under human 
rights law, but only those interferences that must be quali￾fed as cruel. This is especially important for the applica￾tion of human rights norms that do not explicitly refer to 
cruelty but have a broader scope of protection. This 
applies, for example, to the German Basic Law. According 
to Article 2 (2) of the Basic Law, everyone has the right to 
physical integrity, although this right may be interfered 
with on the basis of a law (see . Fig. 8.6). However, this 
legal possibility of intervention can only be considered to 
the extent that the intervention in physical integrity does 
not constitute a violation of a human right due to the lack 
of cruelty. There are interferences into the physical integ￾rity, which do not lead in any way to an endangerment of 
personhood. Such interventions can be permitted by law 
or based on a law. This applies, for example, to compul￾sory vaccination to combat a pandemic. The claim repeat￾edly made by opponents of vaccination in the Corona 
pandemic that their human rights would be violated by a 
statutory vaccination requirement therefore lacks any 
basis.
8.4 Critique of the Case Law
So far, we have philosophically and empirically analyzed 
the notion of the ban of cruel as well as inhuman/degrad￾ing treatment. The results now permit a comparison with 
the ECtHR’s interpretation of Article 3 ECHR. This com￾parison clearly shows the benefts of a thorough philo￾sophical analysis.
153
8.4 · Critique of the Case Law8
The frst defnition of torture as well as inhuman and 
degrading treatment was made in the context of the so￾called “Greek Case” in 1969. It was not the Court itself 
who delivered the defnition, but the European Commission 
of Human Rights. According to the ECHR of the time, the 
proceedings started before the Commission and the 
Commission had to decide whether the case should be for￾warded to the Court. The Commission had a flter func￾tion. The institution was eventually abolished in 1998 
(11th additional protocol).
The “Greek Case” was initiated by Denmark, Norway, 
Sweden, and The Netherlands. It was a complaint against 
Greece, which at the time was governed by a military junta 
that was committing many cruel crimes against Greek citi￾zens. The Commission made a report of almost 700 pages. 
In this context, we fnd the frst defnition of torture and 
inhuman and degrading treatment.
The defnition starts with the concept of inhuman treat￾ment and defnes it as a treatment that deliberately causes 
severe mental or physical suffering (see . Fig. 8.7). The 
Commission added the element of a lack of justifcation. 
Torture was defned by the Commission as a special kind 
of inhuman treatment that contains two additional ele￾ments, namely a particular purpose and an aggravation. 
Degrading treatment was defned as humiliation that drives 
the victim to act against their will or conscience.
These defnitions differ from our own fndings in some 
important respects. We have seen that it does not make 
sense to distinguish between inhuman and degrading 
treatment. Nor does linguistic analysis permit the distinc￾tion between inhuman/degrading treatment on the one 
hand, and torture in terms of the severity of the interven￾tion on the other hand. The idea that the infiction of 
“The notion of inhuman treatment covers at least such treatment that
deliberately causes severe suffering, mental or physical, which, in
the particular situation is unjustifiable. 
The word ‘torture' is often used to describe inhuman treatment,
which has a purpose, such as the obtaining of information or
confessions, or the infliction of punishment, and it is generally an
aggravated form of inhuman treatment. Treatment or punishment of
an individual maybe said to be degrading, if it grossly humiliates him
before others or drives him to act against his will or conscience.” 
. Fig. 8.7 Report of the EComHR on the “Greek Case “
Greek Case
154 Chapter 8 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Physical and Mental Integrity8
severe mental or physical suffering is not inhuman treat￾ment if it can be justifed is obviously unconvincing 
because it denies the absoluteness of human rights.
The Commission delivered no arguments for its view. 
But their considerations have a major impact on case law 
to this day. The Commission could not forward the case to 
the Court because the junta had previously declared its 
withdrawal from the Council of Europe and cancelled the 
ECHR. In 1978, the Court for the frst time had the oppor￾tunity to defne the three concepts in the decision Ireland v. 
UK. The Court essentially followed the Commission’s 
view but deleted the element of justifcation so that the 
three concepts are now purely descriptive concepts with￾out any evaluative element.
In accordance with the Commission, the Court defned 
inhuman treatment as an infiction of intense physical and 
mental suffering, whether combined with bodily injury or 
not. Torture was defned as an “aggravated and deliberate 
form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.” In con￾trast to inhuman and degrading treatment, torture should 
attach “a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment 
causing very serious and cruel suffering.” It is important 
to realize that the Court did not refer to the Commission’s 
opinion that specifc purposes are crucial for the defnition 
of torture. This makes clear that the motivation of the per￾petrator is not crucial for the defnition of human rights in 
general and torture in particular. They are about the pro￾tection of persons and the protection only depends on the 
impairment suffered by the aggrieved. The distinction 
between inhuman treatment and torture in terms of the 
element of aggravation is incorporated from the 
Commission’s point of view. But it is not convincing. It 
simply does not make sense to make this distinction. It is 
completely functionless. If the infiction of less severe pain 
is strictly forbidden, then the infiction of more severe pain 
is strictly forbidden a fortiori. There is no place for a more 
detailed distinction. Therefore, “torture” should be under￾stood as a kind of explanation for the characteristic of 
degrading/inhuman treatment done with cruelty. However, 
this explanation is important because it shows that the 
infiction of severe physical or mental suffering and pain is 
not just an attack on the body and the soul, but rather that 
it degrades a person to a non-person.
Ireland v. UK
155
8.4 · Critique of the Case Law8
Degrading treatment was defned by the Court as 
humiliation. This is meaningless insofar as degradation 
and humiliation are synonymous. Defning a concept with 
its synonyms is not wrong, but superfuous. Furthermore, 
the Court restricted degradation to special cases of humili￾ation, namely to those by which the victims are debased 
and their physical or moral resistance is broken. This also 
does not make sense because humiliation is, by defnition, 
a kind of treatment that debases the victim and breaks his 
resistance. When speaking about physical or moral resis￾tance, the Court thinks in terms of the resistance of one’s 
own will and the resistance of conscience. This distinction 
is also not clear. Will and conscience belong to different 
categories. Conscience is not alternative to will, rather it 
delivers feelings and convictions which motivate the will.
The most problematic aspect of case law is that inhu￾man treatment is considered a fundamental element of the 
legal defnition of the scope of protection. As I have 
argued above, the common element of all three variants of 
ill-treatment that violate Article 3 ECHR is the infiction 
of intense physical and mental suffering, i.e., cruelty. 
However, this is expressed only indirectly in the text of the 
ECHR, namely by means of the concept of torture. But it 
is cruelty that distinguishes this human right from others. 
In contrast, it makes no sense to distinguish between 
degrading and inhuman treatment, since both terms have 
the same meaning. Any violation of human rights, not just 
the human right to be free from cruel treatment, is degrad￾ing or inhuman.
Considering that the protection scope of the human 
right to physical and mental integrity refers to the protec￾tion of personhood, some critics conclude that the exclu￾sion of non-persons from the so-defned protection scope 
leads to a complete lack of protection for those who are 
particularly dependent on the protection because they are, 
by nature, particularly weak. Here, critics think about 
human beings who are not endowed with personhood, like 
individuals that are in an irreversible coma or suffering 
from severe dementia. Others think about animals.
Nevertheless, from the fact that human rights in gen￾eral and the right to physical and mental integrity in par￾ticular protect personhood does not follow that it is 
permissible to treat living entities who are not endowed 
with personhood but are able to suffer with cruelty. 
156 Chapter 8 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Physical and Mental Integrity8
Human Rights do not legitimize crueltyagainst non￾personal living entities. According to Immanuel Kant, it is 
a moral obligation to not commit any cruel treatment 
against any entity which is capable of suffering in order to 
avoid blunting our feelings. The practice of cruelty 
destroys our capacity for empathy. Cruelty against animals 
is a step forward to cruelty against persons, and the moral 
prohibition of cruelty against non-persons is the frst 
required step of our feelings toward persons and the pro￾tection of the physical and mental integrity of persons.

good?

Right to Liberty—Right to Freedom of Movement
The right to liberty (Article 5 ECHR) refers to the free￾dom from captivity. The notion “liberty” describes the 
protection scope rather inaccurately because the word￾ing does not tell us anything about the content of lib￾erty (liberty from what?). The context only tells us that 
it is about freedom from captivity and detention. Free￾dom from captivity is the negative formulation of the 
freedom of movement. Article 5 ECHR is part of the 
so-called habeas corpus rights.
Habeas Corpus Rights
The so-called habeas corpus rights do not generally 
prohibit detention and captivity but provide only a 
closed number of justifying grounds for lawful captiv￾ity (cf. Article 5 ECHR), certain procedural conditions 
(cf. Article 7 ECHR), and a right to a fair trial (Article 
6 ECHR). They are procedural rights only and there￾fore constituent elements of the rule of law.
The Freedom of Movement
Detention as such is a deprivation of the freedom of 
movement. The freedom of movement in a broader 
sense embraces (1) the freedom to move one’s own body 
due to physical needs, (2) the freedom not to be under 
detention (“liberty”), and (3) the freedom to move from 
place to place within a country or across national bor￾ders.
Forced restrictions on the opportunity to move 
one’s own body, exit through a certain point on the 
earth’s surface and the space overhead, or occupying 
another geographical position, can in extreme cases be 
a violation of the right to freedom from torture and 
inhuman treatment (being shackled to a chain, being 
locked in a cage, etc.). But not every restriction of the 
freedom to change the geographical position as such is 
a violation of human rights.
Detention can generally be accomplished in accor￾dance with the principle of human dignity. Therefore, 
restricting liberty in certain cases does not confict with 
160 Chapter 9 · Freedom of Movement and the Rights Under Detention9
human rights (e.g., detention after a lawful conviction 
by a court as a reaction to crimes). The conditions of 
life under detention must be free from bodily or mental 
violence while also ensuring food, sanitation, accom￾modation, and privacy. Furthermore, it must be possi￾ble for the inmates to make relevant decisions about 
their own way of life in order to develop their personal￾ity and to maintain their personhood (see below: total 
institutions).
The codifed right to free movement (Article 4 of 
the fourth Additional Protocol of the ECHR) only 
refers to the right to travel from one place to another 
inside the country or to the freedom to leave the coun￾try. This right is not to be considered a human right. If 
it is possible to lead an authentic life under detention, it 
is also possible to lead an authentic life without having 
the freedom to travel from a particular place of resi￾dence to another. Only if humane conditions of life are 
not available at the present place of residence is the pre￾vention of movement a violation of human rights (right 
to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment).
Total Institutions
Prisons, hospitals, or nursing homes are very often 
organized in a way of total institutions (Erving Goff￾man). Total institutions are places “of residence and 
work where a large number of like-situated individuals, 
cut off from wider society for an appreciable period of 
time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered 
round of life.” Total institutions reduce the opportu￾nity to make meaningful decisions about one’s own life. 
Everything is organized and prepared. There are only 
little choices. This weakens and fnally destroys the abil￾ity of the inmates to lead their lives based on their own 
considerations and refections. The inmates lose any 
sense of responsibility toward their lives such that they 
can no longer be considered authentic acting persons. 
This result depends on the duration of the time inmates 
are exposed to the total institution. A long term stay in 
total institutions establishes a violation of human 
161
Freedom of Movement and the Rights Under Detention9
9.1 The Habeas Corpus Rights
In this chapter, I want to deal with the rights relating to 
the deprivation of the freedom of movement. The term 
freedom of movement is commonly used when it comes to 
the question of whether someone is free to travel from one 
town or region to another inside the borders of a state. 
Still wider framed is the question of the freedom of global 
movement, which refers to the freedom to immigrate.
These questions are, however, not in the center of this 
chapter. We will only come to them at the end and only to 
make some passing remarks. The center of this chapter is 
the deprivation of the freedom of movement in a much 
narrower sense—that is, freedom from captivity. When 
you search for these rights in human rights codifcations, 
you will fnd that all these codifcations deal with these 
rights under the label “right to liberty.” In contrast, I 
prefer the expression “freedom of movement” because the 
term liberty does not tell us to which kind of restriction 
the term refers. The claim for liberty leaves the content of 
liberty open (liberty from what?).
I will subsequently show that the rights concerning 
captivity—despite their belonging to the classical content 
of every human rights codifcation—cannot be considered 
human rights. There is, however, one serious risk for the 
development and maintenance of personhood in this con￾text that deserves special attention. This is captivity in 
total institutions. There, we really meet a human right.
But let me frst give an overview of the rights relating 
to the deprivation of the freedom of movement according 
to the ECHR. These rights are codifed in Articles 5, 6, 
and 7 of the ECHR.
At the center of these rights stands Article 5 (1) ECHR 
(see . Fig. 9.1). According to this Article, “everyone has 
the right to liberty” and no one shall be deprived of their 
rights. The hope of being released in a far future is not 
a suffcient condition to avoid deprivation of person￾hood in total institutions. Instead, it is necessary to 
have a suffcient scope in which the inmates can lead 
their lives responsibly and can make meaningful deci￾sions about the way they want to live.
Reasons for Detention
162 Chapter 9 · Freedom of Movement and the Rights Under Detention9
. Fig. 9.1 Article 5 (1) ECHR
liberty. Nevertheless, this freedom stands under a long list 
of reservations that permit the deprivation of liberty 
through detention. According to this list, detention is per￾mitted and cannot be considered a violation of the right to 
liberty in the following cases:
5 Detention after conviction by a competent court;
5 Arrest or detention for noncompliance with a lawful 
order of a court in order to secure the fulflment of an 
obligation;
5 Arrest or detention in order to bring a person before 
the competent legal authority on suspicion of having 
committed an offense;
5 Detention of a minor for the purpose of educational 
supervision;
5 Detention for the purpose of prevention of the spread￾ing of infectious diseases and of persons of unsound 
mind, alcoholics, drug addicts, or vagrants; or
5 Detention in order to prevent someone from unau￾thorized entry into a country or in order to extradite or 
deport someone from a country.
The arrest or detention must be lawful. This means that 
the reason for the detention or arrest must be described by 
law. Article 7 ECHR adds insofar the rule of “no punish￾ment without law” that prohibits to punish an act that was 
not punishable at the time when it was committed.
The provisions of Article 5 (2) through (5) and Article 
6 provide for certain rights while arrested or in detention. 
These include the right.
5 To be informed promptly of the reasons of the arrest—
Article 5 (2);
5 To be brought promptly before a judge—Article 5 (3);
Rights while under 
Detention
163
9.1 · The Habeas Corpus Rights9
5 To a trial in reasonable time—Article 5 (3);
5 To a fair trial—Article 6;
5 The right to judicial review of the arrest—Article 5 (4); 
and
5 The right to compensation in the case of unlawful 
detention—Article 5 (5).
All these rights are traditionally called habeas corpus
rights. “Habeas corpus” were the initial words of a so￾called habeas corpus writ by which an English court 
commanded the warden of a prison to bring a detainee 
to court in order to review the lawfulness of the impris￾onment. (“[We command] that you should have the 
[detainee’s] body [brought to court].”). Habeas corpus 
rights are part of many human rights codifcations. 
However, they obviously have nothing to do with human 
rights because human rights protect people from a state 
of living where they are no longer able to maintain their 
personhood. The reasons for lawful detention and cer￾tain rights of the detainee, like those concerning access 
to a court, do not refer to whether there are particular 
dangers and risks to personhood while under detention. 
Habeas corpus rights similarly do not refer to the living 
conditions while under detention. They do not protect 
inmates against inhuman living conditions under which 
they are at risk of being deprived of their personhood. 
Habeas corpus rights are only procedural rights and 
therefore simply constituent elements of the rule of law 
and not part of human rights.
Furthermore, why someone is being detained is not 
actually relevant within the framework of the habeas cor￾pus rights. A court’s conviction needs only be based on a 
statute that provides for the punishment of an offense that 
was specifed by law before the defendant committed the 
crime. Habeas corpus rights, however, say nothing about 
the legitimacy of punishing particular conduct. For exam￾ple, it is consistent with habeas corpus rights to punish 
homosexual conduct. Similarly, there is no confict with 
these rights when the criminal code criminalizes criticism 
of the government. However, imprisoning a person for 
being convicted of such crimes must be considered a 
violation of the human right to sexual self-determination 
or the right to freedom of expression.
Habeas Corpus
164 Chapter 9 · Freedom of Movement and the Rights Under Detention9
9.2 Humane Living Conditions While Under 
Detention
In the context of the foundation of human rights, we must 
ask whether detention as such is to be regarded as a matter 
of human rights. Therefore, the question is whether the 
deprivation of the freedom of movement is to be regarded 
as contrary to the principle of human dignity and there￾fore a required object of the protection scope of a human 
right. Here, I think it makes sense to distinguish different 
degrees of deprivation of the freedom of movement and 
to consider all of them separately in order to determine 
whether they are in accordance with human rights.
Consider a prisoner who is locked up in a small cage 
where he must hunch his body within a contained space 
that does not have enough room to take a normal body 
position. He is forced to remain in this position for many 
hours, days, or even weeks. This most extreme degree of 
deprivation of freedom of movement is obviously torture. 
It is a severe violation of human rights, but there is no 
need for an additional human right. Torture is already 
covered by the right concerning the ban of cruel treat￾ment. There is no need to demand a separate human right 
to free movement in order to protect against a maltreat￾ment of this kind.
We can imagine other situations under detention that 
are also clear cases of torture or cruel treatment. Think 
about overcrowded prison cells or very small cells. 
Similarly other human rights can be infringed upon by the 
design of the detention conditions. One important ele￾ment of humane living conditions is having a meaningful 
opportunity for private communication. This is the com￾munication with close friends and with one’s own hus￾band, wife, or children. Detention is often connected with 
the interruption of family ties. This is a violation of the 
right to family life (Article 8 ECHR). The interruption of 
family ties by detaining a person violates not only the 
rights of the prisoner, but also the rights of the other fam￾ily members who are not detained. Human treatment 
under detention, therefore, demands facilities and 
opportunities where the members of the family can meet 
each other under the conditions of privacy. But again, this 
is no reason for a special human right. There is already a 
human right that suffciently addresses humane living con￾Forced Motionlessness

Privacy in Prison

9.2 · Humane Living Conditions While Under Detention9
ditions under detention as they relate to family ties and 
close private relationships. This is the right to privacy (see 
7 Chap. 11). So, we come to a provisory conclusion: the 
set of all the other human rights are also applicable to liv￾ing conditions under detention. It seems there is no special 
threat that is not already covered by the set of the ordinary 
human rights. But this is not the end of the story.
9.3 The Function of Article 10 ICCPR
Article 10 ICCPR may lead to the suspicion that the set of 
ordinary human rights are not enough to safeguard 
human dignity under conditions of imprisonment (see 
. Fig. 9.2). It seems to be a special human right for the 
living conditions under detention. Nevertheless, a closer 
look shows that Article 10 (1) ICCPR does not really add 
to the list of human rights. This can be shown by compar￾ing the provisions that concern the ban of inhuman or 
degrading treatment in Article 7 ICCPR (see . Fig. 9.3). 
Both articles address the way that persons may be treated. 
The difference is that Article 7 prohibits a certain treat￾ment (inhumane treatment) while Article 10 commands a 
certain treatment (humane treatment). We can express the 
difference by saying that the latter commands the omis￾sion of something, while the former commands the act of 
something.
The idea behind Article 7 ICCPR is not that the con￾tracting parties of the Convention should be obliged to 
No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one 
shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or
scientic experimentation.
. Fig. 9.3 Article 7 ICCPR
. Fig. 9.2 Article 10 (1) ICCPR
166 Chapter 9 · Freedom of Movement and the Rights Under Detention9
secure human conditions of life. The only thing they must 
do is avoid establishing inhumane conditions of life. Their 
responsibility is limited to not creating inhuman condi￾tions. They are not responsible for inhuman situations 
that have not been created by them. Comparatively, Article 
10 ICCPR refers to the obligation of the contracting par￾ties to ensure that living conditions be free of any inhu￾manity. Article 10 ICCPR seems to command an activity 
while Article 7 ICCPR only commands an omission.
A closer look, however, shows that this distinction 
does not really exist. The provision in Article 10 ICCPR 
relates to the situation of detention. This is, however, a 
situation that is established by the state. It follows that 
detention under inhuman conditions is a situation that is 
caused by the state. In other words, it is an inhuman treat￾ment, exercised by the state. This shows that Article 10 
ICCPR does not provide something different from what is 
already provided in Article 7 ICCPR. Article 10 ICCPR 
stresses only the fact that the state has a much higher 
responsibility for living conditions under detention than 
for living conditions under freedom of movement. The 
reason for that is easy to understand. Under the condi￾tions of freedom of movement, people can escape from an 
area where they are exposed to an inhumane situation. 
Under detention they cannot escape. Therefore, those who 
detain others are responsible for ensuring the humanity of 
living conditions for those under detention. In such cir￾cumstances, the state takes on the position of a guarantor. 
This is why the state as the operator of detention facilities 
has to make sure that inmates are not treated inhumanely 
by their fellow inmates or by the wardens and that they are 
not injured in goods, which are protected by human rights.
The comparison of Article 7 ICCPR and Article 10 
ICCPR shows that the latter does not provide a special 
human right for living conditions under detention. 
Instead, it is a repetition of the ban of torture and cruel 
treatment as it is already provided in Article 7 
ICCPR. Accordingly, it is a redundant rule. Living condi￾tions while under detention must be in accordance with all 
the human rights that we have previously discussed or that 
we are going to discuss in the further chapters. Nevertheless, 
there is a specifc threat that only occurs under conditions 
of imprisonment and similar situations.
The Redundancy of 
Article 10 ICCPR
167
9.3 · The Function of Article 10 ICCPR9
9.4 Total Institutions
This specifc threat has to do with the fact that detention 
facilities—prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, etc.—tend to 
be total institutions. Total institutions represent a special 
threat to the development and maintenance of person￾hood.
The term “total institution” was introduced by the 
Canadian sociologist Erving Goffman (1922–1982) in his 
1961 book entitled Asylums. Essays on the Social Situation 
of Mental Patients and Other Inmates. The institutions 
Goffman had in mind were not only prisons and nursing 
homes, but also the Army, war ships, and monasteries. 
Furthermore, an additional and seldom mentioned type 
of institution that may also represent a total institution 
appears in the Wikipedia page about total institutions. 
The page refers to cruise ships and other tourist venues, 
but notes that these differ from traditional examples in 
that they do not last for long periods of time. Comparatively, 
extended stays that may come to include entire lifetimes is 
a fact in the cases of prisons and nursing homes.
Goffman defned total institutions as places “of resi￾dence and work where a large number of like-situated 
individuals, cut off from the wider society for an appre￾ciable period of time, together lead an enclosed, formally 
administered round of life.” Among the characteristics of 
total institutions are the following:
1. The inmates are uniformed. They wear similar clothing 
and often a similar haircut. Part of the uniformization 
is also that they have little to no margin to shape their 
environment according to their own tastes and prefer￾ences. Their activities are also uniformed. Each inmate 
has to do the same activity as somebody else or, at 
least, as part of a large group of others. Inmates can￾not choose the activity they want to do and are forced 
to do activities under the commands of superiors. So, 
they cannot display themselves as singular individuals 
who are different from each other. The uniformization 
leads to the loss of interest and motivation to take care 
of oneself.
2. “All phases of the day’s activities are tightly scheduled, 
with one activity leading at prearranged time into the 
next. There is no margin to shape [one’s] own time.”
Defnition
168 Chapter 9 · Freedom of Movement and the Rights Under Detention9
3. The “whole sequence of activities [is] imposed from 
above by a system of explicit formal rulings and a body 
of offcials.”
4. The “various enforced activities are brought together 
into a single rational plan purportedly designed to 
fulfl[l] the offcial aims of the institution.”
This defnition is a defnition of a type. Particular institu￾tions can vary. So, the passengers of a cruise ship may not 
wear the same clothes and they might have a broader mar￾gin to choose activities as compared to the inmates of a 
prison. But one element is common for prisons as well as 
for cruise ships. This is the weakening and disappearance 
of the opportunity to lead one’s own life on the basis of 
one’s own considerations and refections. Under all or at 
least all relevant aspects, inmates in a prison or tourists on 
a cruise ship lose responsibility for their own life. After a 
certain duration of time, the inmates can no longer be 
considered authentically acting persons nor are they able 
to consider themselves as such.
As I noted above, the conditions on a cruise ship are 
not determinative of total institutions because tourists are 
only aboard for a short period of time. They may even 
enjoy the freedom from the everyday burden of being 
responsible for their lives. They use their time aboard to 
recover from the everyday burden of leading their lives 
with authenticity in order to return to these lives with 
renewed strength.
Living in a monastery is different. The members of a 
monastery are always free to leave the monastic commu￾nity. So, it is diffcult to say that a monastery violates 
human rights. Monastic life may lead to a deprivation of 
personhood, but this is not a forced deprivation. 
Nevertheless, this phenomenon leads to the question of 
whether there is a moral duty toward oneself to maintain 
one’s own personhood or whether persons are morally free 
to renounce it. This is, however, not a question of human 
rights. Except for the right to life, human rights protect 
against the deprivation of personhood by offenders who 
are not identical to their victims (see 7 Chap. 14).
In contrast, long lasting detention in a prison can lead 
to a forced deprivation of skills of personhood. It is inter￾esting to note that the organization of total institutions is 
not immediately directed to the destruction of person￾hood, like is the case with torture. Rather, it is an indirect 
way of violation.
Durability
169
9.4 · Total Institutions9
The deprivation of any relevant margin to shape one’s 
own life leads to the devaluation of the personality that 
one has already developed. Personality is based on the 
entirety of someone’s actions that they have committed 
during their life. The maintenance of a personality requires 
the continuation of creating actions based on one’s own 
free will. If all actions that can be committed by the per￾son concerned are rendered useless or irrelevant, then the 
person loses the interest and the motivation to create new 
life plans (see . Fig. 9.4). Initially, they are still able to 
lead their life based on their own will (stable personality). 
When they feel that their personality is threatened because 
they are no longer able to realize their own will by commit￾ting relevant actions (deprivation of self-determination) 
they will try to oppose the rules and conditions of the 
total institution (state of resistance). Considering that this 
resistance cannot be maintained, the respective person 
loses the interest and motivation to rescue it. As their abil￾ity to create free will is exercised less and less, the ability 
will eventually be lost to them altogether.
Thus, the long-term inmates of a prison or hospital 
will subject themselves more and more to the will of the 
wardens and the rules of the system. The frst step is the 
devaluation of personality, the second step is the loss of 
personality, and the third step is the loss of the ability to 
create a personality. These are the tiers of the deprivation 
of personhood. This process is called hospitalization when 
it is related to inmates of hospitals, nursing homes, or 
orphanages. Where this process concerns long term prison 
inmates, we can talk about prisonization.
The German Federal Constitutional Court was the 
frst to recognize the consequences that total institution 
has on the personhood of inmates. In a judgment of 1977, 
the Court ruled that life sentences violate human dignity 
and are therefore unconstitutional, unless there is a real 
chance to be released after a certain period of time. 
According to this judgment, the German Penal Execution

Case Law
170 Chapter 9 · Freedom of Movement and the Rights Under Detention9
Act provides that inmates who have been sentenced to life 
shall be released after a period of 15 years unless there are 
concrete facts for believing that they do not regret their 
crime or if they were sentenced for an extremely severe 
crime.
The ECtHR reached a similar conclusion in Kakaris v. 
Cyprus (2008). The ECtHR ruled that the imposition of a 
life sentence is not per se prohibited by or incompatible 
with Article 3 or any other article of the ECHR. However, 
a life prisoner must in any case have a prospect of release 
after a certain period of time. If imprisonment is subjected 
to a parole review after the minimum term has been served, 
it cannot be said that the prisoner in question has been 
deprived of any prospect of release.
Both courts obviously hold the opinion that an inmate 
is suffciently motivated and able to maintain the capacity 
to lead their life on the basis of their own considerations 
and refections if there is a real prospect of release. I take 
the opinion that the prospect of being released 1 day in the 
far future is insuffcient for avoiding the consequences of a 
total institution. In the case of life imprisonment, it is 
rather necessary to organize the prison in a way that avoids 
the elements of a total institution.
In order to avoid the elements of a total institution, we 
have to think about alternative forms of prisons and 
detention facilities. An interesting example of such an 
alternative is the prison village of San Pedro in Bolivia. 
This village has workshops, restaurants and all the facili￾ties which are customary in Bolivian villages. Nevertheless, 
contrary to ordinary villages, it is surrounded by a fence 
that is guarded. The inmates are not allowed to leave the 
village. The only people living inside are prisoners and 
their wives and children. They organize their own lives. 
The state does not provide for their livelihood or other￾wise intervene in what happens within the village. In 2013, 
after 100  years of existence, the Bolivian government 
planned to close it because gangs of criminals had taken 
over and mistreated the inhabitants of the village. It 
became more and more a breeding place for new crimes, 
committed against the inmates of the prison. Nevertheless, 
it still exists.
If we leave these negative developments aside, then the 
fact remains that the villagers are able to lead a normal 
life. They are only prevented from leaving the site. This 
restriction as such does not involve a situation where it is 
no longer possible to develop and maintain personhood. 
Prison Village
171
9.4 · Total Institutions9
Therefore, it is not diffcult to see why the mere prevention 
of leaving a certain part of the surface of Earth should not 
be considered as a matter of human rights. Captivity as 
such is not a violation of human rights; only the condi￾tions within the detention center can violate human rights.
Under the conditions of the Bolivian prison village, 
the inmates can organize their own life. They can develop 
life plans and they realize them. The defciency is only that 
the state does not take responsibility for the protection of 
the inmates against ill-treatment by their fellow inmates. 
This leads to living conditions that must be regarded as 
inhumane. Failing to ensure the security of the inmates of 
the village is therefore to be considered a cruel treatment 
perpetrated by the State of Bolivia. Nevertheless, the 
Bolivian prison village is a good example of how a fenced 
institution could be organized to fulfl the function of sep￾arating criminals from the rest of the society while avoid￾ing at the same time the elements of a total institution.
The right to freedom from total institutions is not 
expressed adequately in current human rights codifca￾tions. Specifcally, Article 10 ICCPR does not adequately 
describe the protection scope of this right. It cites only the 
general principle behind all human rights, namely the 
principle of human dignity. Nevertheless, every single 
human right is supposed to concretize this general princi￾ple by defning specifc scopes of protection. This is unfor￾tunately not what Article 10 ICCPR does. So, we have to 
recognize that it is necessary to derive a new unwritten 
human right from the principle of human dignity, namely 
the right to freedom from total institutions.
9.5 The Right to Freedom of Movement
As I promised at the beginning, I would like to add a few 
words on the status of the right to free movement. This 
right is found in Article 13 UDHR and in the Article 12 
ICCPR as well as in Article 4 of the fourth Additional 
Protocol of the ECHR. It entitles anyone who is lawfully 
residing in the territory of a state to move freely and to 
freely choose their place of residence there. As I have men￾tioned above, the freedom to travel from one place to 
another inside a state is not necessary in order to maintain 
one’s own personhood. Even the mentioned codifcations 
172 Chapter 9 · Freedom of Movement and the Rights Under Detentionrecognize that this right obviously is not a human right. 
For they make the exercise of the right dependent not only 
on the fact that someone is a human or a person, but also 
that they are lawfully residing in the territory of the state 
in which they wish to move freely. This last condition can 
only be fulflled with the consent of the respective state. 
Rights that depend on the consent of the state cannot be 
considered human rights.
?Do You Still Remember?
1. Do the habeas corpus rights have to be considered 
human rights—why or why not?
2. There is a specifc threat of personhood in prisons 
or in other closed facilities (hospitals, nursing 
homes, etc.) that is not adequately covered by one of 
the codifed human rights. What do you know about 
this specifc threat?
3. What is the function and relevance of Article 10 
ICCPR?
4. Does the codifed right to the freedom of movement 
have to be considered a human right?

Communication Rights
The phrase communication rights embraces:
1. The right to free information;
2. The right to freedom of thoughts;
3. The right to free expression that includes the free￾dom to express assertions (impart information), 
questions, opinions, and convictions, the freedom to 
produce or to perform pieces of art and to do science 
and philosophy;
4. The right to freedom of assembly;
5. The right to freedom of association; and
6. The right to freedom from censorship of generally 
accessible media, like the Internet.
Function of the Communication Rights
The core function of the communication rights is the 
defense of the freedom of will against manipulation. 
The particular communication rights refer to particular 
strategies of manipulation. A manipulated will is not 
based on one’s own considerations and refections but 
on the considerations and refections of the manipula￾tor. Manipulation makes the will of a person into an 
alienated will.
Freedom of Information
The freedom of information protects the free will 
against manipulation by suppressing relevant informa￾tion and/or by producing false information, thus estab￾lishing a wrong world view.
Freedom of Thoughts
The freedom of thoughts protects the free will against 
manipulation by indoctrination. Indoctrination is the 
dissemination of a unilaterally distorted doctrine, com￾bined with the suppression of any criticism. The free￾dom of thoughts embraces the freedom to ask 
questions.
176 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integrity10
Freedom of Expression
Freedom of expression protects the free process of will 
making by ensuring the opportunity to review what 
someone holds as true or convincing. By expressing 
thoughts, we expose our ideas to criticism of others. In 
the light of the criticism of others, we can modify or 
reject them, so that our ultimate manifestation of will is 
based on rational considerations and refections and 
not on illusions and errors. The suppression of the 
expression of thoughts is a manipulative strategy that 
seeks to hinder someone in their creation of a free will 
that is based on suffciently tested rational consider￾ations and refections. We can identify ourselves as the 
author of our will making process only if this process is 
free from manipulation.
The Freedoms of Assembly and Association
Assemblies and associations are media which serve the 
exchange of ideas. Like the mass media, they are an 
instrument by which manipulation, indoctrination, and 
error can effectively be avoided and a forum for criti￾cism can be provided.
Associations and assemblies can furthermore serve 
the purpose of cooperation and the establishing of syn￾ergy effects, power, and infuence. Such cooperative 
activities go beyond the mere exchange of ideas. In this 
respect associations and assemblies are not protected 
by a moral human right. For the freedom to organize 
organizations of cooperation in terms of activities 
beyond the exchange of ideas cannot be derived from 
the principle of human dignity.
Freedom of Censorship
The censorship ban prevents the manipulation of the 
media and protects the public against indoctrination by 
the media. As long as the media have a privileged posi￾tion to speak and be heard, and as long as censorship 
does not oppress certain ideas but refers only to the cut 
off of the privileged position, the protection of the 
media cannot be considered a matter of human rights 
but rather a matter of democracy.

Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual…10
Reservations in the Codifed Communication Rights
The philosophical analysis shows that the restriction 
clauses in codifed communication rights (e.g., Articles 
9 and 10 ECHR) are partly much too extensive. They 
can only be accepted if we take into account that the 
protection scope of the codifed right is wider than the 
protection scope of the moral human right that can be 
derived from human dignity. Thus, it makes sense to 
distinguish the core and the yard of a codifed right. 
The core of the right embraces what is required to pro￾tect the moral human right. The yard embraces what 
falls under the notions of the codifed rights, but lies 
beyond the scope of the moral core. Only an appropri￾ate philosophical analysis of the protection scope of 
the rights allows us to interpret the restriction clauses 
in a way that respects the fact that moral human rights 
are absolute rights that, by defnition, cannot be 
restricted.
Limits of the Protection Scope of the Communica￾tion Rights
Not all content of an idea falls under the protection 
scope of the communication rights. There are thoughts 
which cannot be expressed when the speaker at the 
same time seeks respect for human rights. These are all 
thoughts which contently deny the validity of the cor￾responding human right. A speaker who expresses such 
thoughts is entangled in a performative contradiction. A 
performative contradiction renders both the expressed 
idea and the request for protection by human rights 
meaningless. The idea cannot be taken seriously and 
therefore cannot be under the protection scope of a 
human right (e.g., hate speech).
Performative Contradiction
A performative contradiction is a contradiction 
between a proposition and the speech act by which the 
proposition is expressed. For example, P requires pro￾tection by human rights (= speech act) for their state￾ment that human rights do not exist (= proposition). 
Someone who demands the protection of human rights 
178 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integrity10
The rights that serve to protect intellectual integrity 
include those that are subsumed under the collective term 
of communication rights. These are freedom of informa￾tion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and 
freedom of association. In addition, some codifcations 
also mention freedom of art and freedom of science, 
although in the feld of art and science it is actually only a 
matter of special forms of expression and information, 
but also of assembly and association. For this reason, 
artistic and scientifc freedom will not be discussed further 
in this textbook.
10.1 The Freedom of Information
In the last two chapters, we saw that the infiction of seri￾ous physical or mental harm will frst weaken and later 
destroy the ability of a person to lead their own life on the 
basis of their own free will. The infiction of serious phys￾ical or mental harm of persons is therefore a serious threat 
to personhood, but not to mere animal cruelty. In this 
chapter, we will deal with another threat to personhood, 
namely, the threat to intellectual integrity.
First, I want to talk about the right to freedom of 
information. The ability to create one’s own free will based 
on one’s own considerations and refections requires a cer￾tain amount of information about the conditions under 
which one is living. The person must know the conditions 
of life which they cannot change in order to appropriately 
accommodate themself to these conditions so as to avoid 
getting a “bloody nose.” Furthermore, the person must 
know which conditions of life they can change in order to 
be able to deliver a reasonable judgement of whether these 
conditions should be changed.
for their hate speech express in their speech act the rec￾ognition of human rights, while at the same time deny￾ing the recognition of human rights in what they say. 
From this analysis follows that hate speech does not fall 
under the protection scope of the communication 
rights. From a philosophical point of view, it is not nec￾essary to restrict the protection scope of the communi￾cation rights by special restriction clauses in order to 
oppress hate speech and the like.
179
10.1 · The Freedom of Information10
What happens when the relevant information about 
the conditions of life is incorrect? The person will avoid 
changing conditions which, from their point of view, are 
worth being changed, and they will invest a large effort in 
order to change conditions which are unchangeable. 
Although it is possible for a person to create their free will 
based on incorrect information, it is not possible for them 
to properly lead their life on the basis of such a fawed free 
will.
In terms of human rights, incorrect information as 
such is not problematic. Law, morals, and human rights 
cannot establish living conditions in which the risk of 
error is completely eliminated. We must live with errors, 
i.e., with false information.
But what should we make of the situation where some￾one makes decisions based on false information provided 
by another person who deliberately brought forth such 
information to manipulate the will of others?
Manipulation does not encompass every instance of 
activity that infuences the process of will making of 
another person. The strategy of infuence is manipulative 
only if it makes the person unable to verify critical truths 
relating to the information because they have been system￾atically cut off from all true information that would be 
suitable for recognizing the truth.
What is the relevance of manipulation in the context of 
human rights? The result of manipulation is that the tar￾get person will eventually make decisions for which they 
are not the actual author. Instead, the authors of the deci￾sion are those who manipulated them. The manipulated 
person may even believe themself to be the author of their 
life. They too may not suffer from the manipulation 
because they have no awareness of it. Nevertheless, they 
are not leading their life on the basis of their own consid￾eration and refections, but rather on the considerations 
and refections of the manipulators. This shows that 
manipulation is a serious attack to one’s own authenticity 
through the violation of intellectual integrity. The free￾dom of information is the freedom from manipulation 
through the suppression and distortion of information.
The right to freedom of information is subject of both 
Articles 9 and 10 ECHR (see . Fig.  10.1). Article 10 
mentions the freedom to receive and impart information 
and ideas without interference by public authority and 
regardless of frontiers. This provision guarantees the 
active (impart) as well as the passive (receive) freedoms of 
Manipulation
180 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integrity10
. Fig. 10.1 Freedom of information and expression
information. The norm only protects against interferences 
by public authorities and does not take into account that 
the freedom of information can also be impaired by pri￾vate agents. In such formulations, it becomes clear that the 
traditional view only considered the state as being able to 
violate human rights and that human rights therefore 
restrict only the power of the state. So, Article 10 ECHR 
codifes less than what is necessary in order to completely 
cover the protection scope of the moral human right to 
information. The freedom of thoughts (Article 9) refers to 
the ban of any kind of indoctrination by the state as well 
as by other institutions and individuals who have the 
power to do so. Indoctrination is a kind of education that 
consists of the manipulation of information in order to 
avoid any critical assessment.
Article 10 ECHR further includes the right to freedom 
of expression. This is a little bit confusing insofar as free￾dom of expression includes the freedom to impart infor￾mation. Indeed, this is a duplication in the codifcation. 
But expression refers not only to the expression of pieces 
of information, but beyond that.
10.2 Freedom of Expression
Now I come to freedom of expression. Freedom of expres￾sion refers not only to the expression of information, but 
to a wider range of concepts. We can distinguish between 
the expression of assertions and questions on the one 
hand, and the expression of opinions and convictions on 
the other. Let us frst deal with the expression of asser￾tions.
181
10.2 · Freedom of Expression10
The protection of intellectual integrity requires the 
freedom to express assertions. If it is about the expression 
of assertions that orientate others then we refer to the pro￾tection scope of the freedom of information. But the free￾dom of expression is also important in order to orientate 
oneself – that is, the sender of the allegation.
It is important to understand that the freedom to 
express assertions does not refer only to the expression of 
true assertions. It embraces also the expression of asser￾tions which are false. It might be questionable why express￾ing false assertions should be protected too, because the 
expression of assertions is a piece of information for oth￾ers and information is only valuable if it is true. 
Nevertheless, false assertions are also valuable for the sake 
of orientation of the sender. This is why the expression of 
assertions is an instrument of review of what someone 
holds as true. It is necessary to express what we hold as 
true so that it becomes possible for others to criticize our 
allegations. In light of that criticism, we can then correct 
false assertions and so free ourselves from error. From this 
follows that the freedom of expression embraces the 
expression of false allegations which are based on an error, 
but not false allegation which are based on a lie. Telling 
lies is not protected by human rights because lies are nei￾ther useful to inform others nor useful to orientate oneself. 
Lies are not necessary but counterproductive to the pur￾pose of leading your life on the basis of your own consid￾erations and refections.
In order to receive a true view of the world so that we 
become able to lead our life on the basis of our own con￾siderations and refections, it is also necessary to ask ques￾tions. People have been persecuted under many oppressive 
regimes simply because they ask certain questions, for 
example questions which refer critically to the content of 
the public indoctrination. So, it is obvious that there is a 
need for the protection of the freedom to ask questions.
In order to lead our life on the basis of our own consid￾erations and refections, we need not only the possibility to 
review the allegations which we hold as true, but also the 
possibility to review our opinions and convictions which 
we hold as adequate and appropriate. Only when we can 
express the result of our considerations and refections in 
front of others – and in the light of the criticism of oth￾ers – is it possible to make an assessment of them in terms 
of adequateness or appropriateness. The expression of 
Assertions

Opinions
182 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integrity10
opinions and convictions is therefore an essential tool for 
creating an authentic free will.
The distinction between opinion and conviction should 
make clear that we need the freedom of expression to 
assess more than just our own considerations and refec￾tions of which we are still not entirely convinced (opin￾ions). This tool is also important with regard to those 
results of our considerations and refections of which we 
are entirely convinced. In the frst case, we may express our 
ideas in order to test them in the light of the public criti￾cism. In the second case, we express them in order to 
inform others about our own life plans or in order to infu￾ence their own process of will making. In the case of a 
conviction, we are sure that nothing can be criticized. But 
nevertheless, we know it can. The expression of convic￾tions exposes them to the criticism of others, regardless of 
whether we intend as much. In any case, this criticism can 
keep us from building our lives on false ideas.
10.3 Freedom from Censorship
The codifed rights to freedom of information as well as to 
the freedom of expression also cover the ban on censor￾ship. Traditionally, this ban corresponded to the freedom 
of the press and later to the freedom of radio and televi￾sion or, in general, to the freedom of so-called mass media. 
Mass media provides access to a large indefnite and anon￾ymous group of receivers and therefore has a very high 
grade of effective infuence over public opinion. 
Considering that access to traditional newspapers or TV 
channels is strongly restricted, the opportunity to spread 
their messages is restricted to a relatively small group of 
people. These people have a privileged position which pro￾vides them with a certain kind of power. Someone in the 
position of a journalist who has the opportunity to write 
articles for the New  York Times or the Süddeutsche 
Zeitung obviously has a higher chance to be heard than 
ordinary people who can express their opinions only in 
front of a small group of people who listen to them. That 
only changed with the Internet. Access to the Internet is 
hardly restricted and therefore does not provide a particu￾lar position of power. Everybody is more or less capable 
of spreading their messages through the Internet and the 
chance to be heard is more or less equal for everybody.
Convictions
183
10.3 · Freedom from Censorship10
In terms of human rights, we have to distinguish 
between communication platforms which provide a privi￾leged position concerning the chance to be heard by a cer￾tain audience, and communication platforms which do not 
provide such a privileged position. The moral human right 
to freedom of expression does not protect such privileged 
positions because they do not protect privileged positions 
of power over other people. The freedom of the press, 
including the ban of censorship concerning mass media in 
a privileged position, can therefore not be considered a 
human right. It is rather a kind of civic right that is not 
based on the principle of human dignity but rather on the 
principle of democracy.
The same distinction is relevant in the case of a school￾teacher, for example. Their position to express their opin￾ions in front of the school class is not protected by a 
human right because this position is a privileged one. The 
students are coerced to attend school and cannot avoid 
listening to the teacher. So, they do not have the opportu￾nity of avoiding a confrontation with the teacher’s politi￾cal or religious opinions. The right to freedom of 
expression, however, does not only embrace the freedom 
to speak and to listen, but also the freedom to remain 
silent or the right to not necessarily be confronted with an 
opinion that someone does not want to hear. Furthermore, 
the expression of a political opinion in school classes is 
unfair and disturbs the free exchange of ideas when the 
teacher misuses their position and privilege to get atten￾tion. Therefore, the school administration may restrict the 
right of the teacher to express their opinions in front of 
the school class. 1 But if the teacher distributes political or 
religious fyers outside the school on the streets, their 
chance to speak and be heard is exactly the same as any￾body else’s. Therefore, their freedom to spread their mes￾sage on the streets is protected by human rights. This 
shows that the human right to free expression is very 
closely connected with a certain standard of equality. 
Equality here refers to the absence of privileges and to 
equal chances to express ideas and to be heard.
1 Certain political or moral opinions can of course be made a subject 
of school education. In this case, the teacher is empowered to fght 
for certain ideas in their classes. But they do not act here in their 
capacity as a holder of human rights, but as an instrument of the 
offcial education policy.
No Protection for 
Privileges
184 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integrity10
10.4 The Right to Free Assembly 
and the Right to Free Association
There are still other human rights that are dedicated to the 
protection of intellectual integrity. These are in particular 
the right to free assembly and the right to free association 
(see . Fig. 10.2). Associations and assemblies are actually 
media in a wider sense. Therefore, they are to be protected 
in order to ensure an effective exchange of ideas and to 
protect individuals against attempts of manipulation and 
indoctrination. Assemblies as well as associations bring 
people together so that they can communicate with each 
other. Assemblies gather people only for a short amount 
of time, associations stabilize the gathering through time 
and space and give them a more stable structure.
Assemblies – particularly associations – are not only, 
or necessarily, purely communication platforms. They can 
also be used to work together in order to shape the world, 
to create synergy effects, and to effectively change the 
world. When associations or assemblies do so, they 
develop activities that go beyond the mere exchange of 
ideas. Therefore, they are no longer protected by human 
rights which seek to protect the intellectual integrity. They 
make use of freedom of action and not the freedom to 
produce a free will on the basis of one’s own consider￾ations and refections. The freedom of action has nothing 
to do with intellectual integrity and is therefore not part of 
the protection scope of the communication rights.
Article 11 ECHR and all the other similar human 
rights codifcations protect assemblies and associations 
not only in their capacity as communication platforms, 
but also as means of cooperation. The norm refers expres￾sively to the right to form and to join trade unions. Trade 
unions are by defnition not just communication plat￾forms. Rather, they are organizations in which a certain 
kind of social power emerges in order to push through 
appropriate working conditions and an adequate income 
Communication

Core and Yard
. Fig. 10.2 Right to assembly and association

10.4 · The Right to Free Assembly and the Right to Free Association10
for its members. The positive law confers certain privileges 
and guarantees to the existence to the trade unions. This 
mirrors the relevance of the working class in an industrial 
society and is thus not a result of philosophical refection 
about human rights.
As far as the rights relate to freedom of cooperation, 
i.e., to the freedom of action, they cannot be considered a 
transformation of a moral human right into a juridical 
human right. So, we have to state that the codifcations use 
the concepts of assembly and association with a double 
meaning. The frst meaning refers to assemblies and asso￾ciations as communication platforms, while the second 
meaning refers to the organization of social agency. Only 
the frst meaning refers to the codifcation of a moral 
human right. Only this meaning refers to the principle of 
human dignity. This example shows again that it is 
extremely helpful and fruitful to distinguish between the 
core and the yard of the respective right when interpreting 
codifed human rights. (This issue was already addressed 
when we found that compulsory vaccination does not 
affect the core of the human right to bodily integrity, see 
Sect. 7 8.3).
I will not discuss this difference in further detail, but I 
want to move to another important characteristic of the 
structure of the codifed human rights which plays a par￾ticular role in the context of the communication rights.
10.5 Restriction Clauses
This important characteristic appears in Article 10 (2) 
ECHR (see . Fig. 10.3). Considering that human rights 
are derived from the principle of human dignity and that 
human dignity is an absolute value, it follows that human 
rights must also be absolute rights. The provision of 
Article 10 (2) ECHR seems to not be in accordance with 
this conclusion. It authorizes the state to establish formal￾ities, conditions, restrictions, or penalties that seem to 
limit the scope of protection of the rights concerned. We 
could conclude that Article 10 ECHR is not an appropri￾ate codifcation of the moral human right of freedom of 
expression and information. The problem of reservations 
is also encountered in connection with other human rights 
codifed in the ECHR, namely the right to respect for pri￾vate and family life (Article 8(2)), freedom of religion 
(Article 9(2)) and freedom of assembly and association 
Limiting Clauses
186 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integrity10
. Fig. 10.3 Restriction clauses
(Article 11(2)). In the following, the limitations of Article 
10 (2) ECHR will be examined by way of an example.
The clause distinguishes between formalities, condi￾tions, restrictions, and penalties. Formalities and condi￾tions may not necessarily function as means of limitation, 
but they can function as such. Let us imagine a law that 
requires an offcial permission if a political party wants to 
attach election posters in public spaces. As long as the per￾mission only depends on the location where they can be 
fxed, so as to avoid covering road signs or traffc lights or 
otherwise hampering road traffc, there is no confict 
between such a formality and the communication rights. 
If on the other hand, the permission depends on the con￾tent of the election posters, then we are confronted with a 
severe confict between the two. This shows that not every 
conceivable formality can be accepted. Only formalities 
which do not lead to a restriction of the protection scope 
may be taken into account.
There are also conceivable conditions that do not 
restrict the right but rather make sure that it is exercised in 
a way that does not violate the rights of others. So, it is a 
condition in this meaning to prohibit the expression of a 
teacher’s political opinion while they are teaching students 
in school in order to protect the students’ negative free￾dom of thoughts.
As far as the provision mentions penalties, this can also 
be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the abso￾lute status of human rights. This is the case where the pen￾alties relate to the violation of provisions concerning 
admissible formalities or conditions. If provisions about 
these formalities and conditions are consistent with the 
Formalities
Conditions
Penalties
187
10.5 · Restriction Clauses10
absolute status of human rights then so too are the sanc￾tions that correspond to violations of these provisions.
Now we come to the most problematic part of Article 
10 (2) ECHR. It authorizes the state to establish restric￾tions of the rights mentioned in the frst paragraph. The 
very frst condition for restrictions, just as for formal 
requirements, conditions and penalties, is that they are 
regulated by law. Restrictions on the scope of protection 
of communication rights are therefore subject to a legisla￾tive proviso. First and foremost, legislative provisory 
clauses serve the purpose of making restrictions possible 
only if they are regulated in legal form, i.e., in an abstract￾general manner. This ensures that they apply not only to 
specifc individual cases, but in general, i.e., in a large 
number of abstractly determined cases. This not only pre￾vents arbitrariness but it also tends to weaken the political 
motivation to restrict rights. For anyone who creates a 
generally abstract norm in order to use it to suppress cer￾tain opinions runs the risk that the same regulation will 
1 day be applied against themself and their opinions, pre￾cisely because the proviso is formulated in abstract and 
general terms. The legislative proviso, therefore, does not 
function as an instrument of restriction, but rather as a 
hurdle that makes the restriction of rights more diffcult. 
It must therefore be seen as a means of protecting human 
rights and not as a means by which human rights are 
threatened.
The problem of restriction appears if we analyze the 
particular components of the list of grounds for restric￾tion. I shall start with the ground for restriction of prevent￾ing the disclosure of information received in confdence.
Information is confdential when the owner of the infor￾mation wants to exclude some others from knowledge. 
This exclusion from information can hinder persons from 
receiving pieces of information that would help produce 
their own free will. Exclusion of information can therefore 
be a means of manipulation. This makes confdentiality 
problematic.
Nevertheless, we have to consider that the maintenance 
of personhood and the leading of one’s own life based on 
one’s own considerations and refections does not require 
a complete knowledge of everything that could be relevant 
to make decisions. We are almost always in situations 
where we have to make decisions under conditions of 
uncertainty. General rules that defne a class of informa￾tion that can be made into a subject of confdentiality

Restriction.
Confdence.
188 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integrity10
reduce the scope of our knowledge, but they do not hinder 
us from making responsible decisions. A lack of knowl￾edge as such is not manipulation. It only becomes manip￾ulation if the target person is deliberately made to believe 
that their knowledge is complete and true, although it is 
neither. As long as the person knows that there is some 
more information that they are missing, they can deal with 
this fact by considering the uncertainty of the situation. 
The legitimacy of confdentiality ends where manipula￾tion starts. This is the case when someone uses the veil of 
confdence in order to commit crimes or other unlawful 
behavior. This is the reason why, for example, whistleblow￾ing is not a violation of the legitimate scope of confdenti￾ality. Whistleblowing is permissible because it protects 
under the frame of freedom of information and freedom 
of expression.
What I said about the question of confdentiality also 
applies to state secrecy on reasons of national security, ter￾ritorial integrity, or public safety. Such restrictions do not 
concern the human right to free communication because 
they only reduce the scope of our knowledge and force us 
to decide under uncertainty. It is not a kind of 
manipulation.
But I should make one more remark. There is a huge 
difference between the admissible scope of confdentiality 
concerning private individuals or organizations and the 
admissible scope of confdentiality concerning the state. 
Confdentiality in favor of private individuals is or can be 
a matter of human rights, namely the right to privacy that 
protects persons against inappropriate public control (see 
next chapter). Confdentiality in favor of the state, how￾ever, is not protected by human rights. On the contrary, 
the possible scope of confdentiality in favor of the state is 
restricted by the principle of democracy. The state under a 
democratic constitution has to be a state under public con￾trol. The scope of confdentiality that the state can enjoy 
never covers unconstitutional or unlawful acts of public 
authorities. They may not hide their activities behind a veil 
of confdence.
I come to the ground for restriction of the protection of 
the rights of others. The prevention of disorder and crime is 
not to be considered separately because it serves only the 
protection of the rights of others. So, we can deal with 
these grounds for restriction together. Of course, we can 
imagine types of disorder and crime that have nothing to 
do with the rights of others. It is possible to conceive of a 
National Security, etc.
Rights of Others
189
10.5 · Restriction Clauses10
particular opinion as infringing the public order without 
any connection to the right of others. But a restriction that 
only oppress such an opinion would be a restriction of the 
right to expression that can be justifed only in rare cases. 
I will come back to these cases below.
But what about the rights of others? Do they justify a 
restriction of human rights? The most important human 
right that can be violated through the exercise of the free￾dom of expression is the right to privacy. In fact, the right 
to privacy embraces several different human rights. So, it 
makes more sense to speak about a bundle of rights. 
Privacy embraces a certain scope of information about a 
person, which is to be treated confdential not because cer￾tain provisions of the law defne it as confdential but 
because it is embraced by the protection scope of the 
human right to privacy. In order to be able to analyze the 
possible conficts between the communication rights and 
the right to privacy it is necessary to have more knowledge 
about the latter. This is the topic of the next chapter. 
Therefore, I will come back to this point in the next chap￾ter.
The next ground for restriction is the protection of 
one’s reputation. Reputation or honor is the image that a 
person displays in the public and the way a person is per￾ceived by their fellows in society. Public image constitutes 
the expectations that society addresses to the person con￾cerned.
I shall give you an example. An important element of 
the reputation of a person can be that they are considered 
reliable. A person who is considered reliable enjoys many 
advantages because the expectations of society make it 
easy for the person to pursue their objectives. Therefore, 
persons are interested in a good reputation. Furthermore, 
reputation sometimes also constitutes a certain kind of 
appreciation by society that confrms or even stabilizes the 
self-esteem of the respective person (not the self-esteem as 
person but the self-esteem as personality).
Both examples show that reputation is a high good for 
everybody. The question is, however, whether the protec￾tion of reputation alone can justify a restriction of the 
right to freedom of expression. I think it cannot. 
Nevertheless, we must distinguish between two different 
possible attacks against the reputation of a person.
The frst kind of attack replaces a public image that is 
true with another image that is not true. This is what hap￾pens when someone paints a public image of an unreliable 
Reputation
190 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integrity10
person although the respective person is reliable. We call 
such an attack against reputation defamation.
The legal oppression or punishment of defamation. is 
not contrary to human rights. Defamation. is a kind of lie 
and we have seen that freedom of expression does not 
embrace the freedom to lie. Nevertheless, not every untrue 
allegation is a lie. It can also be considered a mere error. 
And as I said above, freedom of expression embraces the 
right to express untrue allegations if they are based on an 
error and not on a lie. Still, the law can require that allega￾tions which may cast doubts on the reputation of someone 
be expressed very carefully. They are only acceptable if 
there is some evidence that confrm the doubts. Those who 
cast doubts on the reputation of another bear the risk of 
their possible error. It is justifed to hold them liable for 
their error. Laws which provide regulations about this lia￾bility can therefore not be considered a restriction of the 
protection scope of communication rights. They refer only 
to the yard of these rights and not to the core.
Nevertheless, it must be possible to destroy the reputa￾tion of someone if the public image of that person is 
wrong and they do not deserve the good reputation that 
they enjoy. Restrictions of the freedom of expression in 
order to protect reputation are only permitted when the 
destruction of reputation is unjustifed, but not against a 
justifed destruction of a reputation that itself is based on 
a wrong public image. In order to protect the core of the 
communication rights, we cannot demand that the destruc￾tion of reputation only be allowed if there is defnitive 
proof in favor of the claim that the public image of some￾one is wrong. It must also be possible to express serious 
doubts if there are serious reasons for believing that the 
reputation is based on a wrong image.
Article 10 (2) ECHR allows the restriction of freedom 
of thought and information also for the purpose of health 
protection. Opinions that seriously compromised health 
protection caused serious problems during the Covid-19 
pandemic. Due to such widespread but scientifcally unjus￾tifed opinions, it has not been possible to establish the 
“herd immunity” that would have been achievable through 
a high vaccination rate.
Can such a situation justify the suppression of the 
opinions of the opponents of vaccination? This question 
cannot be answered unequivocally with yes or no. It rather 
depends on whether the anti-vaccination propagandists 
can be convicted of lying, i.e., intentionally spreading 
Protection of Health
191
10.5 · Restriction Clauses10
falsehoods, or whether they are merely in error. One may 
assume that among the opponents of vaccination there are 
numerous liars. But not everyone who has reservations 
about Covid vaccination is a liar. Many people are in error 
because they are ill-informed about the scientifc facts. 
Others do not dispute the scientifc facts, but consider 
them irrelevant because they are guided by certain reli￾gious or quasi-religious beliefs that prohibit them from 
getting vaccinated. This can also be understood as a form 
of error. Error is not a suffcient reason to suppress an 
opinion. I can hardly imagine a situation in which the sup￾pression of an honest assertion or opinion can be justifed 
on the grounds of health protection. There is only one way 
to fght against opinions and beliefs that are dangerous to 
health: we must fght with arguments in favor of vaccina￾tion and do our best to publicly and privately refute the 
counter-arguments of the opponents of vaccination and 
expose them as false and dangerous. As long as they are 
still held, we must endure them.
Let me say some words about the ground for restriction 
of maintenance of the authority and impartiality of the 
judiciary. One case is the secrecy of the deliberations of 
the Court. As you may know, judges are obliged to keep 
secret what is discussed behind closed doors in order to 
ensure an open discussion of the case among the judges. 
This is a special case of what we discussed before under 
the aspect of confdentiality. It is a state secret, the preser￾vation of which does not violate the human right of free￾dom of information. Nor does this obligation to maintain 
secrecy violate the freedom of thought of the judges, who 
are required to maintain the secret. This is only different if 
the subject of the deliberation and the subsequent adop￾tion of a resolution was a clear perversion of justice, 
because that is a criminal act for which state organs can￾not claim protection of secrecy. In this case, what has been 
said above for whistleblowers applies to judges who report 
on this publicly.
Another case could be what is called Litigation PR. 
This refers to the strategic use of media reports to infu￾ence a court. There was a famous case recently in Australia 
concerning the trial to avoid public infuence on the court. 
In December 2018, a court in Melbourne convicted a 
Cardinal of abusing two choirboys. The court issued a 
“media gag order” (order of secrecy), according to which 
it was prohibited to report the sentence in public media in 
order to avoid any kind of public infuence on the jury, 
Authority of the 
Judiciary
192 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integrity10
because the cardinal was accused of additional instances 
of child abuse. Only in February 2019 did the court decide 
to lift the order after it was clear that the priest should not 
be accused of other cases. I think that the authority and 
impartiality of the judiciary does not justify the restriction 
of the press in order to reduce the public infuence on the 
judges. Only the protection of privacy of the accused or of 
witnesses could give reason for an oral hearing where the 
public is excluded or for the anonymization of judgments. 
But the authority and impartiality of the judiciary does not 
provide any justifcation for the suppression of the right to 
expression or the freedom of information.
What about the restriction ground of morality? Moral 
opinions or convictions are a matter of free expression 
and information just as any other content of communica￾tion. The suppression of public discussion of moral opin￾ions would lead to the standstill of moral development. 
There is therefore in general no justifcation for this ground 
for restriction. Morality is also not a suffcient ground for 
restriction when it comes to a display of opinions that 
seem to be contrary to the common moral feelings. In 
Turkey, for example, a public demonstration of gays and 
lesbians was prohibited because the authorities regard 
homosexuality as immoral. Nevertheless, it seems to be 
obvious that certain moral preunderstandings and tradi￾tions cannot justify a restriction of human rights. 
Generally, we can state that the ground for restriction of 
morality was originally associated with sexual morality. It 
referred to the bigoted and uptight sexual morality of the 
1950s when the ECHR was made. In the context of the 
right to free expression, it was to serve the purpose of sup￾pressing pornography. In 1951, the movie “Die Sünderin” 
(“The Sinner”) appeared, in which Hildegard Knef could 
be seen naked for just a second. The authorities prohibited 
the flm but the Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG) 
considered it as a piece of art under the protection scope 
of the freedom of art (under Article 5 GG).
Nevertheless, we must remember that human rights 
themselves are a matter of morality. And indeed, there are 
cases possible where opinions are not compatible with the 
morality of human rights. Nevertheless, it can be shown 
that such opinions do not require a restriction of the scope 
of protection of the communication rights because they 
simply do not fall under the protection scope of these 
rights.
Morality
193
10.5 · Restriction Clauses10
Examples of such opinions are those which typically 
are expressed in so-called hate speech or opinions that 
otherwise support racism. The core content of such opin￾ions is the denial of the human dignity of particular per￾sons or groups by reasons of race, nationality, gender, and 
so on. It can be shown that such opinions do not fall in the 
protection scope of any human right. In order to do so, we 
make use of a thought experiment. Imagine an individual 
who expresses hate speech and is therefore punished. They 
complain about the punishment and refer to the human 
right to freedom of expression. What are they doing 
exactly? They express disrespect about human dignity and 
human rights with regard to others while at the same time 
claiming the protection of human dignity and human 
rights for themself. This is not compatible with the gener￾alized and equiprimordial character of human dignity and 
human rights. The hate preacher commits what is called a 
performative contradiction.
A performative contradiction is a contradiction 
between the content of a proposition and the speech act 
by which the proposition is expressed (see . Fig.  10.4). 
First, I want to demonstrate it with the following example. 
Someone says, “I assert that all assertions are false!” Are 
we supposed to take this statement seriously? No, we can￾not take it seriously because the speaker expresses words 
without any meaning. So, it is not really an expression that 
is protected by the communication rights, but only an 
emission of sound that falls under the laws against the 
emission of noise.
What the speaker seems to do, namely, expressing an 
assertion, includes the claim that true assertions are pos￾Performative 
Contradiction
. Fig. 10.4 Performative contradiction
194 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integritysible. Otherwise, the assertion would not be an assertion. 
But what the speaker says is that assertions are always 
untrue. So, they are expressing the following claim: 
Assertions are always untrue and there are true assertions. 
This is a contradiction that makes their words senseless.
This is exactly what our hate preacher does. They say, 
“I respect the human rights (with regard to myself) when I 
express the opinion that I disrespect them (with regard to 
others).” They deny what they are saying (the disrespect of 
human rights) through what they are doing (claiming the 
protection of human rights). It is not possible to take this 
attitude seriously. It cannot be considered an exercise of 
freedom of expression. And because it is not an exercise of 
the freedom of expression, this right cannot be violated by 
the punishment or suppression of hate speeches.
This applies not only to hate speech, but to any state￾ment that denies the personhood of individuals or the 
absolute value of personhood. As a rule of thumb, state￾ments about a person that do not enable a meaningful 
response of the person concerned are not protected by the 
right to free speech. For example, when a speaker calls 
someone a “pig” or a “flthy cunt,” a meaningful, logical 
response to begin a constructive dialogue with them does 
not exist. In other words, it would make no sense to say: 
“Oh, you’re wrong, I’m not a flthy cunt.” Insults of this 
kind make the insulted person rather silent. They are no 
longer respected as a conversation partner. They are not 
perceived as someone, but only as something. Personal 
insults like these and similar utterances that deny person￾hood do not fall within the scope of protection of the 
right to free thoughts and free speech.
As a condition for a restriction on freedom of thought 
and information, Article 10(2) ECHR states that the 
restriction must be necessary in a democratic society. 
According to the wording of the English and French ver￾sions, this justifcation operates independently alongside 
the other justifcations already discussed. The offcial 
German translation deviates from this. According to it, 
necessity in a democratic society does not stand indepen￾dently alongside the other legitimate purposes of restric￾tion, but represents an additional condition for the 
restriction of the human right. National security, protec￾tion of health, morality and all the other purposes from 
which restrictions are supposed to be justifed only provide 
suffcient justifcation if the respective restriction is neces￾sary in a democratic society.
Necessity in a 
Democratic Society
195 10
10.5 · Restriction Clauses10
Although this reading differs from the authoritative 
text of the English and French versions, it is the one on 
which the ECtHR bases its case law. In doing so, it empha￾sizes above all the criterion of necessity, without placing it 
in a compelling relationship to democracy. For the Court 
does not allow it to be suffcient that a restriction is 
intended to serve one of the legitimate aims of the restric￾tion, but requires that the restriction is also necessary (in a 
democratic society). Accordingly, what is necessary in a 
democratic society is what is absolutely necessary to 
achieve the goal of the respective restriction of the human 
right. The ECtHR thus places all restrictions on rights 
under the proviso of the principle of proportionality. 
According to this reading, the question of the suitability 
and necessity of the restriction and its appropriateness in 
relation to the purpose is decisive, while the explicit refer￾ence to the principle of democracy plays no particular 
role.
Nevertheless, it is interesting, that the ECtHR very 
often justifes restrictions of human rights on the basis of 
the necessity in a democratic society. It has done so, for 
example, in the case of the burka ban law in France. The 
Court considered that the ban was a restriction of the 
right to freedom of religion, but that this restriction can be 
justifed under the ground for restriction of necessity in a 
democratic society. However, the Court did not explain 
how a certain piece of fabric that hides the face can dam￾age the process of the public opinion making, the proce￾dures of establishing candidates for parliament or public 
offces, or the procedures of the election and democratic 
law making.
It would have been more plausible if the Court had 
referred to public morality in France because the conceal￾ment of the face in public in France is, like nudity, consid￾ered immoral. But as we have seen above, morality can 
also not justify a restriction of human rights except in the 
event that the opinion in question denies respect for 
human dignity.
If one sees in the formula of necessity in a democratic 
society nothing more than a paraphrase of the principle of 
proportionality, it must be clear that this principle can 
only be considered if it is a matter of a restriction of free￾dom of action, but not if the case falls under human rights 
insofar as they can be derived from human dignity. Thus, 
196 Chapter 10 · Human Rights Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Integritythe applicability of the principle of proportionality can 
only be considered if the case falls within the very broad 
scope of protection of a codifed human right, but not 
within its core scope, which constitutes the actual human 
right and must be protected absolutely (. Fig. 10.5). We 
will deal with the principle of proportionality in more 
detail in 7 Chap. 18.
As the example of confdentiality shows, the codifed 
scope of protection of the freedom of thought and infor￾mation is broader than the scope of protection required by 
the moral right of the freedom of thought and informa￾tion. To the extent that limitations are placed by law on the 
codifed scope of protection that do not affect the moral 
core, there is no objection to this. The freedoms that go 
beyond the core of moral human rights concern only 
action and not will. Their restriction is only a restriction 
of freedom of action, but not a restriction of freedom of 
will. Restrictions such as the ban on hate speech are also 
unobjectionable. They do not restrict the scope of protec￾tion of the right in question, but merely indicate its con￾ceptual limits. In these cases, the restriction relates to an 
area that is covered neither by the core nor by the yard of 
the protected area. What is prohibited is conduct that lies 
outside the scope of protection.
10
. Fig. 10.5 “Core” and “Yard” of a positive human right
197
10.5 · Restriction Clauses10
The wording does not indicate that the limitation 
clauses refer only to the yard of human rights and to its 
conceptual limits. This can only be deduced from their 
meaning, which can be determined by means of a philo￾sophical analysis. We must read this meaning into the lim￾itation clauses of human rights codifcations. They are not 
intended to place the actual human right under legal reser￾vations, but only the content of the positively defned 
scope of protection, which goes beyond what human dig￾nity requires.
Therefore, it is meaningful and useful to distinguish 
between the core and the yard of codifed human rights. In 
this way, it is possible to reconcile the unconditionality of 
human rights with the positivized provisions on reserva￾tions of limits.
This position allows a criticism of the case law of the 
ECtHR, which does not make this distinction and consid￾ers that necessity in a democratic society refers to the prin￾ciple of proportionality and even allows a limitation of 
the core sphere of human rights. Aspects of proportional￾ity can only play a role in the sphere of the “court” of 
human rights and not in the sphere of the moral core of 
these rights.

Function of the Privacy Rights
The core function of the privacy rights is the defense of 
the freedom of will against self-alienation by fxation on 
role-identities. In the public sphere, persons must sup￾press important parts of their personality in order to 
meet the expectations and ascriptions of society. They 
do not display their true personality in public, but rather 
a specially shaped and distorted image of their personal￾ity that can be called their role-identity (Erving Goff￾man). The permanent display of a role-identity leads to 
the person’s loss of consciousness about who they really 
are, i.e., about the components of their real personality. 
They thus become, so to say, a marionette of social 
expectations and lose the ability to determine themself 
on the basis of a real understanding of themself. This 
leads to a systemically distorted process of will-making 
that cannot be considered authentic. This leads to the 
state of self-alienation (Goffman). The privacy rights 
refer to the protection of an authentic will-making pro￾cess by ensuring a sphere of life in which persons are not 
forced to display a role-identity. The particular privacy 
rights refer to particular protected areas of life where 
persons are not exposed to the public so that they can 
experience the personality they really are and build a free 
will on the basis of their real personality. While privacy 
in general is absolutely needed to protect human dignity, 
which areas should be defned as areas of privacy depend 
on the specifc social and cultural situation. This is at 
least partly a matter of positive law.
The Right to Privacy in One’s Home
The home is a place of stay that may not be observed 
from the outside. Inhabitants can behave inside the 
home without being coerced to play a role in front of a 
public audience.
The Right to a Private Life
The right to a private life (Article 8 ECHR) embraces 
not only the life inside one’s own fat, but also private 
activities and communications within the frame of 
close and intimate relations outside the home (e.g., a 
private talk on a walk in the park).
202 Chapter 11 · The Human Right to Privacy11
The Right to Freedom of Marriage
Freedom of marriage does not only embrace the right 
to freely choose a spouse and to marry them, but also 
the right to not being forced to marry (negative right). 
A person who is forced to get married is deprived of the 
opportunity to establish an intimate relationship with a 
sexual partner when they are forced to live with a part￾ner with whom there is no intimate relationship. Thus, 
the aggrieved person is permanently forced to perform 
a role-identity in front of the spouse.
The Right to Freedom of Establishing a Family
The right to freedom of establishing a family refers to 
the freedom to choose whether to have children. Con￾sidering that the relationship between parents and chil￾dren is a very intimate one, it would be a severe violation 
of the right to privacy to force someone to have chil￾dren or to prevent them from having children (e.g., the 
one child policy in China).
The Right to Family Life
The right to family life protects the close and intimate 
relation between spouses and between parents and chil￾dren. Nevertheless, the moral right to privacy encloses 
any kind of relation where there is a very close and inti￾mate relationship between partners. From a moral 
point of view, this right does neither depend on certain 
sexual preferences nor on any sexual character of the 
relationship. Therefore, protection scope embraces 
homosexual relationships as well as non-sexual close 
relationships (parents with their adult children, monks 
and nuns in a small monastery, intimate residential 
communities between friends, etc.). The codifed pro￾tection scope here (family life) is not wider but nar￾rower than the protection scope of the moral human 
right. This is particularly the case when the term “fam￾ily” is interpreted as necessarily based on a heterosexual 
relationship.
203
The Human Right to Privacy11
The Right to Privacy in One’s Correspondence
The right to privacy in one’s correspondence extends 
the area of privacy beyond the immediate spatial area 
of a particular communication to certain types of 
remote communication. This is due to increasing mobil￾ity in the modern world. Many people who are in an 
intimate relationship live spatially far away from each 
other and cannot use the protected space of a fat for 
their communications.
There are types of correspondence that do not fall 
under the protection scope of the moral right to pri￾vacy, for example business correspondence.
Correspondence is a type of remote communication 
that traditionally involves sending physical letters. 
More modern types of remote communication are tele￾communication or Internet communication. Which 
types of remote communication are to be regarded as 
deserving protection under the right to privacy depends 
on the technical standards and the life style of the given 
society in which the communication occurs. It can 
hardly be only derived from the principle of human 
dignity and instead requires additional political and 
practical consideration.
Right to Data Protection
The right to protection of personal data prohibits the 
collection of personal data that is not permitted by law 
and for a specifc purpose. Additionally, under this 
right, data may not be collected longer than is neces￾sary to fulfl the stated purposes. It similarly contains 
the right to be informed about a collection of personal 
data, the prohibition of using the data for other pur￾poses than the stated purposes, and the right to get 
access to one’s own personal data.
Right to Freedom of Conscience and Religion
Human rights concerning privacy include the right to 
freedom of conscience and the right to freedom of reli￾gion. These two rights are dealt with in separate chap￾ters.
204 Chapter 11 · The Human Right to Privacy11
Social Integration
The ECtHR refers to the right to private life in order to 
protect the social ties of a person that go beyond inti￾mate relations. It is about the “rootedness” of a person 
in the society. This case law was developed in the con￾text of cases about aliens who were to be expulsed or 
deported from a country in which they had lived for a 
long time and where they were well integrated. The 
Court considers the expulsion or deportation of an 
alien a violation of private life if the compulsory termi￾nation of the stay in the inland is at the same time an 
uprooting. Uprooting takes place where the suffciently 
dense network of social relations is cut off.
It is, however, questionable whether the dense net￾work of social relations can be understood as an aspect 
of the right to privacy. Obviously, such a right has 
nothing to do with protecting one’s own personality 
from the threats of permanently displaying role-identi￾ties. Perhaps, the aspect of social rootedness can be 
covered by an unwritten human right sui generis that 
we could call the Right to Membership or the Right to 
Affliation. It is a desideratum of future research to 
clarify whether such a right can be derived from human 
dignity.
Statutory Reservations
Intrusions into privacy by public security agencies is in 
accordance with the moral core of the right to privacy 
only if the hidden sphere of privacy is misused for pur￾poses which have nothing to do with the restitution or 
maintenance of the real personality of persons. This is 
the case when privacy is used to commit or to plan 
crimes. Nevertheless, such intrusion is only justifed if 
the crime or the planning of crimes really occur and not 
if there is a (false) suspicion of criminal activities. It 
can also be necessary to intrude into the sphere of pri￾vacy against the will of the persons concerned in the 
event of an emergency—for example, if an epidemic 
requires removing persons from their fat and into 
quarantine.

The Human Right to Privacy11
11.1 The History of Privacy Rights
While the history of most classical human rights begins in 
the 17th or eighteenth century, the right to privacy is a 
“discovery” of the nineteenth century. The birth certifcate 
of the right to privacy is an essay given by American law 
professors Samuel D. Warren (1852–1910) and Louis D. 
Brandeis (1856–1941) published in 1890. The right to pri￾vacy is a very good example of how individual human 
rights respond to specifc threats to human dignity based 
on the conditions of life in a particular age. In the case of 
the right to privacy, these were the particular threats cre￾ated by the advent of Yellow Journalism. This phenome￾non is again connected with a new technical invention, 
namely the roll-flm and the rapid spread of the Kodak 
camera developed by George Eastman in 1888. It allowed 
for snapshots to be taken for the frst time and thus the 
dissemination of pictures from the private lives of celebri￾ties. As a result, the life situation of people who are con￾stantly under public observation was brought to a wider 
consciousness. That created a sense of the value of pri￾vacy. Consequently, Warren and Brandeis demanded a 
right to privacy. It was not developed from considerations 
about human dignity. Warren and Brandeis argued, rather, 
on the basis of traditional common law as it had been 
developed for centuries by the English courts. So, they 
argued along the lines of breach of confdence, property 
rights, and the ban of defamation and the like. The article 
initially had great infuence on the legislation of many US 
states, which established a right to privacy by statute. In 
1928, Brandeis, now a judge on the US Supreme Court, 
Nevertheless, in these cases it is always possible to 
avoid a confict with the right to privacy. In particular, 
it is possible to make the impending intrusion known to 
those concerned in advance so that they may prepare 
for it by putting on the mask of their role-identity. 
Clandestine observations in the private sphere are, how￾ever, very problematic and hardly justifable (see case 
law concerning eavesdropping operations).
206 Chapter 11 · The Human Right to Privacy11
. Fig. 11.1 Article 8 and 12 ECHR
declared in a dissenting vote that the US Constitution 
guaranteed a “right to be let alone” (Olmstead v. US). The 
Supreme Court fnally accepted that view in 1967 (Katz v. 
US).
At the level of human rights, the right to privacy 
already appears in the UDHR (Article 16), in the ICCPR 
(Article 10), and in Articles 8 and 12 ECHR see 
. Fig. 11.1). The right to privacy is a general term that 
embraces several particular human rights. These rights are 
the following:
5 The Right to Privacy in One’s Home
5 The Right to Private Life
5 The Right to Freedom of Marriage
5 The Right to Freedom of Establishing a Family
5 The Right to Family Life
5 The Right to Privacy in One’s Correspondence
The right to freedom of conscience and the right to free￾dom of religion are not usually included in the group of 
rights relating to privacy. However, we will see in the fol￾lowing two chapters that it makes sense to include these 
rights in the area of privacy.
207
11.1 · The History of Privacy Rights11
11.2 The Need for Privacy
Let me start the analysis of the protection scope of pri￾vacy with a reference to a very famous book that was pub￾lished frst in the year 1959: The Presentation of Self in 
Everyday Life by Erving Goffman. The function and value 
of privacy can be well explained on the basis and against 
the background of Goffman’s concept of role-identity. 
The German sociologist Niklas Luhmann shared a similar 
approach, which may have been infuenced by Goffman. 
Still, he identifed the term privacy with the term human 
dignity, which is not very useful.
Interactions between persons are usually carried out 
under the condition that the participants of the interac￾tion know far less about each other than they need to 
know in order to respond appropriately and effectively to 
the actions of other participants. In the absence of suff￾cient information, they therefore rely on the impressions 
that they can gain from the other participants. In other 
words, they rely on the image they have of them. 
Considering that each participant in an interaction knows 
that everyone is dependent on the impressions that each 
make on another, participants are motivated to behave in 
a way so that they cause the impression that they intend to 
cause, so that they will be treated by others the way they 
want to be treated. So, a given participant will put them￾self in scene and perform a self-dramatization. The impres￾sion that someone performs is perceived by the others as 
an allegation, namely an allegation that the performer is in 
reality as they appear to be. At the same time, the perfor￾mance is considered a promise, namely the promise to 
behave permanently and constantly in accordance with 
the displayed personality.
Nevertheless, the allegation that the participant is the 
personality which is displayed through the performance, 
so that others may rely on it, is always fundamentally false. 
Indeed, persons are spontaneously determined by affects, 
moods, mental and emotional impulses, and uncontrolled 
bodily reactions that are largely subject to unforeseeable 
fuctuations. People who behave in accordance with their 
spontaneous impulses leave no impression of a consistent 
and coherent personality whose behavior is suffciently 
predictable so that others may count on it in everyday 
interactions. They tend to act like small children who are 
guided by their spontaneous emotions, moods, and 
Self-dramatization
208 Chapter 11 · The Human Right to Privacy11
impulses, and are therefore not taken seriously as a part￾ner of an interaction between adults. In order to ensure a 
successful interaction, participants must thus suppress 
their spontaneous emotions, moods, and impulses. This 
has the consequence that the impression they display does 
not correspond to what they really are, but is rather a 
mask behind which they play a role in front of spectators. 
So, participants in an interaction always play theatre in 
front of each other. The staging follows a specifc role with 
which actors consciously or subconsciously identify them￾selves in the manner that they want to be seen by the audi￾ence (= the other partners of the interactions).
Now comes the crucial point. The necessity of always 
having to play a role in interpersonal interactions can lead 
to the result that the individual inadvertently internalizes 
the role in such a way as to no longer being able to distin￾guish between their true self and their role-self. In such 
cases, the individual is not only the performer, but at the 
same time, the spectator of their own performance. They 
consider the impression of themself, which they perform 
in front of others, as the only reality of themself. They 
become part of their own audience. This only occurs when 
they hide all the discreditable facts about themself from 
their own awareness. In such a case, there will be some 
important aspects of their personality that they are no 
longer aware of and therefore deny. Goffman calls this the 
state of self-alienation. In the state of self-alienation, the 
individual can no longer determine their own life accord￾ing to their own will and their own values. They no longer 
lead their life—rather it is led by the ascriptions and expec￾tations of the audience for whom they play this role.
At this point, privacy comes into the play. In order to 
avoid self-alienation and to maintain the awareness of 
one’s real personality, it is necessary to not reside perma￾nently on a “stage.” Thus, in addition to the interaction 
space of the stage, there must be a space that Goffman 
calls “backstage.” In contrast to the situation on the stage, 
the audience is excluded from the backstage. Social inter￾action does not take place here or is reduced to a mini￾mum. The individual remains unobserved and is not 
forced to perform a role. Here, the individual can relax 
from all the efforts that come along with the maintenance 
of role identity. They can unwind and “fall out of charac￾ter”; they can drop the mask, loosen their self-control, and 
behave exactly equivalent to their spontaneous affects, 
emotions, impulses, and moods. In this way, we can experi￾Self-alienation
Privacy as Backstage
209
11.2 · The Need for Privacy11
ence ourselves as we really are. From this experience, we 
can build a distance to the roles that we have to play on the 
stages of life. This distance allows us to take positions in 
relation to the roles that we play. We can refect on our 
roles or modify them, test them, and try to practice new 
roles. Thus, the individual is able to lead their own life on 
the basis of their own authentic considerations and refec￾tions and not become a passive plaything of alien ascrip￾tions and expectations.
What Goffman calls the backstage is what is meant by 
privacy. Privacy refers to a certain sphere of life that is hid￾den from the views of others. The scope of this sphere 
must be exactly as large as is necessary and suffcient to 
make it possible to loosen self-control and to be the per￾sonality that a person really is, including all the aspects 
that cannot be displayed in public. The requisite extent of 
privacy depends on the number of efforts a person has to 
invest in order to play their role. This is why the extent of 
the sphere of privacy depends on the overall social situa￾tion.
11.3 The Particular Rights to Privacy in Light 
of Gofman’s Theory
Against the background of Goffman’s theory, it is easy to 
understand the function of the particular privacy rights.
11.3.1 The Right to Privacy in One’s Home
The home is a place of stay that may not be observed from 
the outside. Inhabitants can behave inside the fat without 
being coerced to play a role in front of a public audience. 
The fat is surrounded by walls and is therefore not visible 
without particular effort, for example, the clandestine 
installation of cameras or microphones. The right to pri￾vacy in one’s home includes the prohibition against pene￾trating the fat without the consent of the owner. This is 
what traditionally is called the domestic peace.
Home
210 Chapter 11 · The Human Right to Privacy11
11.3.2 The Right to Private Life
Private life embraces not only the life inside one’s fat, but 
also a certain behavior outside the home, in particular, 
close and intimate communication with other people. So, 
privacy protects, for example, a private talk with another 
person during a walk. This shows that privacy relates to 
more than just the individual when they are alone. It also 
embraces close and private relationships with other peo￾ple. The ECtHR decided, for example, that the Princess of 
Monaco can claim a certain sphere of privacy in the mid￾dle of the public, e.g., when she is sitting in a restaurant 
with her family. Another very important example for the 
protection of privacy while standing in public is the prohi￾bition of permanent surveillance of employees by cameras 
during their worktime.
The right to private life also embraces the impenetra￾bility of one’s body. Therefore, body scanning without the 
consent of the person concerned is a violation of privacy. 
Involuntary drug and alcohol testing or involuntary blood 
sampling for the detection of drug use also fall under the 
protection scope of privacy. Investigations that seek to 
determine the sexual orientation of a person against their 
will or without their consent is another example.
11.3.3 The Right to Freedom of Marriage
Freedom of marriage does not only embrace the right to 
freely choose a spouse and marry them, but also the right 
to not being forced to marry. A person who is forced to get 
married is deprived of the opportunity to establish an inti￾mate relationship with a sexual partner because they are 
forced to live with a partner with whom there is no inti￾mate relationship. Having an intimate relationship, after 
all, requires that a person have the opportunity to freely 
choose their partner. Otherwise, the partner is and remains 
a “stranger in my bed” in front of whom the coerced per￾son must play a role. Forced marriage therefore leads to 
the absence of privacy.

11.3.4 The Right to Freedom of Establishing 
a Family
The right to freedom of establishing a family refers to the 
freedom to choose whether or not to have children. 
Considering that the relationship between parents and 
children is a very intimate one, it would be a severe viola￾tion of the right to privacy to force someone to have chil￾dren or to otherwise hinder their attempts at having 
children—for example, the former one-child-policy in 
China.
11.3.5 The Right to Family Life
The right to family life protects the close and intimate rela￾tion between spouses and between parents and children.
Nevertheless, there are of course also other intimate 
relations that fall under the protection scope of the moral 
right to privacy. From a moral point of view, this right 
also covers close homosexual relationships and non-sexual 
close relationships (for example, parents with their adult 
children, monks and nuns in a small monastery, intimate 
residential communities between friends, etc.). The codi￾fed protection scope here is not broader, but narrower 
than the protection scope of the super-positive moral 
human right. Therefore, it is up to human rights courts to 
extend the protection scope to these types of relations. 
Because the protection of family life is not about protect￾ing an institution, but about enabling the members of a 
close and intimate life relationship to retreat into private 
life together. They will do so if they have an appropriate 
understanding of the core function of the right to privacy.
This point gives us the opportunity to consider whether 
courts have the constitutional competence to widen the 
meaning of the concept “family” in order to cover other 
forms of intimate relations according to what is demanded 
by human dignity. The German Federal Constitutional 
Court (BVerfG) is here in a privileged position because it 
can ground any such decision on Article 1 of the German 
Constitution, which contains the human dignity principle. 
So, it is no problem for the BVerfG to refer directly to this 
principle. The ECHR does not contain a reference to the 
principle of human dignity. Therefore, it is a little bit more 
diffcult for the ECtHR to fnd a basis of legitimization for 
Family
Intimate Relations
Meaning of Family
212 Chapter 11 · The Human Right to Privacy11
widening the protection scope of codifed human rights. 
Nevertheless, it is not impossible.
According to the case law of the ECtHR, the ECHR is 
to be interpreted as a “living instrument.” This means that 
the appropriate understanding of the convention and its 
particular articles is something that depends on the devel￾opment of the prevailing cultural and moral conscious￾ness. Therefore, the meaning of the human rights 
codifcations cannot simply be found by asking for the his￾torical background at the time in which the codifcations 
were drafted. The meaning of the codifed human rights, 
rather, should follow the currently prevailing understand￾ing of society with respect to our moral duties and rights. 
This allows for widening the meaning of the concept of 
family beyond the traditional understanding. The doc￾trine of the codifed human rights as living instruments is 
an entrance gate that makes it possible to make philosoph￾ical arguments infuential in the case law relating the 
ECHR. Philosophical analyses can contribute to a deeper 
understanding of the meaning of human rights. These 
considerations show that the legal accessibility of same 
sex marriage is not only a matter of legal discretion and 
political infuence, but also primarily a question of human 
rights.
11.3.6 The Right to Privacy in One’s 
Correspondence
The right to privacy in one’s correspondence extends the 
area of privacy beyond the immediate spatial area of the 
communication in accordance with the type of remote 
communication. This is due to the increasing mobility of 
the modern world. Many people who are in an intimate 
relationship live far away from each other and cannot use 
the protected space of a fat for their communication. 
They thus depend on remote communication.
Correspondence is a type of remote communication 
that traditionally involves sending physical letters. More 
modern types of remote communication are telecommuni￾cation or Internet communication. Which types of remote 
communication are to be regarded as deserving protection 
under the right to privacy depend on the technical stan￾dards and the life style of a given society. Such can hardly 
be only derived from the principle of human dignity and 
Living Instrument
Remote Communica￾tion
213
11.3 · The Particular Rights to Privacy in Light of Gofman’s...11
instead requires political and practical considerations. 
Here we fnd another example for the ECHR as a living 
instrument.
11.3.7 The Right to Data-Protection
After all, control over one’s own personal data (right to 
informational self-determination) is a particularly impor￾tant aspect of the right to privacy in our days. It was estab￾lished for the frst time by a statute of the German state of 
Hesse in 1970 and recognized as a constitutional human 
right by a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in 
1983. On the supra-national level, it was codifed as a 
human right in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental 
Rights of the European Union of 2007. In 2008, the 
ECtHR confrmed the right to the protection of personal 
data as derived from Article 8 ECHR.
The protection of personal data is intended to prevent 
persons from losing their ability to determine themselves 
from their own considerations and refections, from hav￾ing, as it were, “the scissors in their head” because they 
“cannot determine with suffcient certainty what kind of 
personal information is known to certain parts of their 
social environment, and if it is diffcult to ascertain what 
kind of information potential communication partners 
are privy to”. The Federal Constitutional Court has 
rightly stated that such a person may be consciously or 
unconsciously inhibited in their freedom “to make self￾determined plans and decisions” (BVerfGE 65, 1, 41). 
Therefore, there is a human right to protection against 
unlimited collection, storage, use and disclosure of one’s 
personal data. Everyone has the right to know at all times 
who knows what about them, when and on what occasion.
11.4 Protection of Social Ties (“Rootedness”)
The ECtHR also addresses the protection scope of private 
life in cases concerning wider social relationships. 
According to this case law, the compulsory termination of 
a foreigner’s stay in the inland may be a violation of pri￾vate life if the expulsion or deportation is at the same time 
an “uprooting” where the foreigner is cut off from their 
wider social relations. Such cases include, for example, 
where children are cut off from their school classes and 
214 Chapter 11 · The Human Right to Privacy11
their relationships with classmates, or where foreigners are 
cut off from their football team or their integrated role in 
a team of colleagues at the work place. Nevertheless, social 
relations at the work place, at school, or in a football team 
are just the opposite of what is meant by the “backstage” 
of privacy. Cutting off such relations can hardly be con￾sidered the interruption of very close and intimate rela￾tions.
In fact, the ECtHR has “discovered” a new and unwrit￾ten right here, whose scope of protection is fundamentally 
different from that of privacy. It is therefore diffcult to 
assign this right to the protection scope of Article 8 
ECHR. I think it would be much clearer to speak of an 
unwritten right, namely the right to membership or the 
right to affliation. However, for such a right to be covered 
by the jurisdiction of the ECtHR, it would have to be 
attributable to a codifed right of the ECHR.  Perhaps 
Article 3 of the First Additional Protocol to the ECHR of 
1952 (right to free elections) or Article 3 of the Fourth 
Additional Protocol of 1963 (prohibition of expulsion of 
own nationals) or Article 1 of the Seventh Additional 
Protocol of 1984 (protection against expulsion) could be 
considered.
11.5 Limiting Clauses of the Codifed Human 
Rights to Privacy
Now we know what is meant by privacy and why and to 
what extent it is a required condition for the maintenance 
of personhood. So, let us move on to the codifed 
provisions concerning possible restrictions.
Article 12 ECHR (the right to marry and to establish a 
family) contains the phrase “according to the national 
laws governing the exercise of this right.” This clause does 
not necessarily have to be considered as a limitation clause. 
It can also be understood as a reservation of formality, 
according to which it is permitted to regulate by law the 
procedure and form according to which marriages are to 
be contracted.
However, there is a substantive restriction on the right 
to marry insofar as states prohibit multiple marriages 
(polygamy) by law and thus deny a married person the 
right to enter into another marriage. One will only be able 
to solve this problem adequately in terms of human rights 
Formalities of 
Marriage
Polygamy
215
11.5 · Limiting Clauses of the Codifed Human Rights to Privacy11
if one distinguishes between marriages which, by their 
structure, are not intimate partnerships and those which 
cannot be denied recognition as intimate partnerships. 
Traditional polygamous marriage, as is common in some 
Islamic countries, is probably more likely to belong to the 
former group, so that in this respect the question of the 
protection of privacy should not arise. But the possibility 
of polygamous intimate cohabitation cannot be excluded 
from the outset.
Article 8 (2) ECHR, however, contains a restriction 
clause that is as far encompassing as the restriction clauses 
of the communication rights (see 7 Chap. 10). It is thus 
necessary to examine in detail the extent to which it 
addresses meaningful demarcations between the core and 
the yard of human rights or whether it is, in fact, about a 
non-acceptable license to interfere with the core of the 
human rights.
Article 8 (2) empowers public authorities to interfer￾ence with the rights to privacy under certain conditions. 
Provided that public authorities act in accordance with the 
law, they may interfere for the following reasons:
5 Interest of national security or public safety
5 Protection of the rights and freedoms of others
5 Prevention of disorder or crime
5 Protection of health
5 Economic wellbeing of the country
5 Protection of morals
5 Necessity in a democratic society
As noted above (see 7 Sect. 10.5), the enumerated grounds 
for restriction are only applicable when public authority 
acts in accordance with the law. This provision refers to a 
statutory reservation. Everything that I have said about 
similar clauses in the context of the communication rights 
applies here as well. So, let us instead focus on the restric￾tion clauses themselves.
The ground for restriction of the interest of national 
security and public safety as well as the prevention of disor￾der and crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms
of others refer more or less to the same purpose. They can 
deliver a justifcation for invading the scope of privacy if 
this hidden sphere is misused. We can speak about a mis￾use if the private sphere does not serve the purpose of pro￾viding a space for recovery from the efforts of public 
representation on the stage, and instead is used as a space 
to plan or commit crimes. The preparation or the commis￾Statutory Reservation
National Security, etc.
216 Chapter 11 · The Human Right to Privacy11
sion of crime is neither necessary nor suffcient for this 
recovery. Therefore, the function of privacy is not inter￾fered by an intervention in the private sphere for the pur￾pose of preventing crime. Engagement with the absolutely 
protected core area of human rights does not take place. 
Nevertheless, this only applies if a misuse really happens, 
not just when there is only a suspicion of criminal activi￾ties that turns out to be false.
A misuse of privacy can only be considered as such if 
the planning or commission of crimes is not only a small 
side-effect that occurs within the frame of private life. The 
intrusion into privacy is therefore no violation of the core 
area of the human right of privacy where criminal activi￾ties play a dominant role. We can thus only accept such 
interference in cases of very serious crimes.
The confict between the protection of privacy and the 
prevention of crimes particularly occurs where intrusion 
into the private sphere has to be clandestine in order to be 
successful. An extremely hard case is the case of eaves￾dropping operations. An eavesdropping attack consists of 
the continuous clandestine observation of a private fat by 
means of electronic devices, where everything that hap￾pens in the fat is recorded. The inhabitants of the fat are 
not aware of the operation and therefore cannot behave in 
an appropriate manner. They behave as though they were 
in the backstage, while in truth remaining on the stage.
The German Federal Constitutional Court holds the 
opinion that eavesdropping operations are nevertheless in 
accordance with the human right to privacy if the records, 
which refer only to the private activities, are deleted imme￾diately so that afterwards only the criminal activities are 
on the records. Still, it is unavoidable that policemen will 
frst have to listen to the private activities before they can 
delete them. Therefore, eavesdropping operations seems to 
me to be only marginally justifable, if at all. In the confict 
between public security and the human right to privacy, 
we must decide which is more important. I think security 
is not a value as such. Security is rather the security of 
human rights. Therefore, we cannot balance security with 
human rights. It makes no sense to defend a good by 
destroying it.
Much less problematic is the invasion into privacy 
when the person concerned is aware of the situation. In 
this case, the person can behave adequately by displaying 
a role on the stage. So, when the policemen knock at the 
Eavesdropping 
Operations
217
11.5 · Limiting Clauses of the Codifed Human Rights to Privacy11
door and demand entry, there is in principle no confict 
between privacy and the prevention of crimes.
In the case of the protection of health, I cannot imagine 
a case in which it would be necessary to secretly invade 
privacy. There could be cases in which it is necessary to 
penetrate a fat in order to quarantine people with infec￾tious diseases against their will. But there is no reason to 
do that secretly. It is therefore always possible to avoid the 
confict between the right to privacy and the protection of 
health.
The economic wellbeing of the country can never pro￾vide a justifcation for an intervention into privacy. There 
are cases where the destruction of fats and the resulting 
homelessness of the inhabitants were justifed under the 
mantle of the economic wellbeing of the country. The 
building of sport stadiums or shopping centers or facto￾ries are considered necessary for the economic wellbeing 
of the country and serve as justifcation for the depriva￾tion of privacy. It is obvious that this kind of justifcation 
cannot be convincing. A different case is where the state 
offers alternative appropriate accommodation. Such does 
not result in a confict between the human right to privacy 
and the economic interests of the country. So, expelling 
people from their home in order to set up mines or water 
reservoirs may be justifable if the state provides an alter￾native accommodation.
The protection of morals can never justify an interven￾tion into privacy. Human rights do not fnd their limit in 
the protection of morality, because they are themselves 
founded in morality (human dignity). Therefore, there is 
no imaginable case where the protection of morality as 
such could justify an intervention into the right to privacy. 
As you might remember, in the last 7 Chap. I mentioned 
that the ground for restriction of the protection of morals 
can be understood only before the background of the big￾oted and uptight sexual morality of the 1950s. Morality in 
such a context only means sexual morality. Thus, it is not 
surprising that the reservation of the protection of moral￾ity within the framework of privacy always comes into 
play when sexual interactions are to be disturbed or sup￾pressed. Thus, as recently as 2008, the BVerfG confrmed 
the punishability of sibling incest (Section 173 (2) Criminal 
Code) explicitly with reference to a “culturally and his￾torically founded, still effective social conviction of the 
punishability of incest,” i.e., explicitly on moral grounds. 
The same applies to the punishability of plural marriage

218 Chapter 11 · The Human Right to Privacy(bigamy /polygamy- Section 172 Criminal Code). In 1992, 
the EComHR invoked the “Christian based monogamous 
culture” to justify it.
Moral motives can dominate legislation only if the 
core area of human rights is not affected, but only that 
marginal area which, in the case of broadly defned human 
rights norms, can be regarded as the “yard” of human 
rights. I will return to this in 7 Chap. 20.
I have said everything about the ground for restriction 
of the necessity in a democratic society in the last chapter 
and, accordingly, it is not necessary to repeat that discus￾sion. So, we have seen that the right to privacy, like the 
right of free expression, embraces a wider protection scope 
than is required by the principle of human dignity. So far, 
as the protection scope embraces areas beyond the scope 
of human dignity, i.e., beyond the conditions of person￾hood, restrictions are possible because we are dealing here 
with a simple positive right. But insofar as the right to pri￾vacy can be derived from the principle of human dignity, 
it must be recognized as absolute. Under such a concep￾tion, the right to privacy would not allow any restrictions.

for a restriction of the rights to privacy?

The History of the Concept “Conscience”
Conscience as a legal concept appeared for the frst time 
in the treaties of Westphalia of 1648, thus terminating 
the Thirty Years’ War in central Europe. In order to 
avoid further religious wars, the contracting parties 
accepted the freedom of their subjects to exercise their 
religion according to their own free conscience (“con￾scientia libera”). The drafters of the treaty considered 
conscience as a kind of inner organ by which individu￾als are able to conceive the commandments of God. 
These commandments referred to the way worship 
should be celebrated as well as to the way believers 
should treat their fellow humans (moral rules).
In the time of the Enlightenment, philosophers 
considered rules of worship more or less irrational and 
the rules of morality as commandments of reason. This 
led to a change in the meaning of the concept of con￾science. Conscience no longer referred to the com￾mandments of God, but to the commandments of 
reason concerning the moral duties toward fellow 
humans. The connection between religion and con￾science was cut off (Samuel Pufendorf, Christian 
Thomasius).
Christian Wolff and Immanuel Kant distinguished 
further between morality and law. Both refer to the 
duties toward fellow humans, but the moral duties are 
duties toward oneself due to the own conscience while 
the legal duties are duties toward the community due to 
the laws of the community.
Further progress of the history was characterized 
by a confusion between the older concept of conscience 
from the time of the Reformation and the more recent 
concept of conscience from the time of the Enlighten￾ment. This confusion is made clear by the fact that, in 
most codifcations, conscience and religion are still 
closely related to each other. In the year 1960, the 
BVerfG made a clear distinction between the legal con￾cepts of conscience and religion for the frst time.
222 Chapter 12 · The Right to Freedom of Conscience12
Defnition of the Concept “Conscience”
Conscience is (1) the knowledge of the standards of 
morality and (2) the conviction of being bound by them 
through identifcation. Moral standards are standards 
of being a “good” human being (like standards of legal 
counseling are standards of being a “good” lawyer).
A person who is acting or has acted against moral 
standards to which they feel bound will reject themself 
as a human being because they consider themself as 
someone who is “not good at their job” as a human 
being (just as a lawyer who fails to competently provide 
legal counsel will reject themself as a lawyer because 
they are not good at their job). Moral shame is the reac￾tion of self-rejection because of a personal defciency 
relating to moral standards.
In order to avoid the feeling of moral shame, the 
respective person is forced to cease being a human 
being (like the incompetent lawyer is forced to cease 
being a lawyer in order to avoid professional shame). 
The only way to give up being a human being is suicide. 
In order to avoid suicide, most human beings choose 
strategies of coping with moral shame, namely trans￾forming shame into feelings of guilt or fights into neu￾rotic displacements.
The Function of the Right to Freedom of Conscience
The core function of the right to freedom of conscience 
is the defense of the freedom of will against a feeling of 
moral shame from which the person concerned can only 
escape by suicide or by neurotic self-alienation. Freedom 
of conscience is the freedom from the coercion to act 
contrary to one’s own moral convictions. A person who 
is coerced to act contrary to their own conscience cannot 
transform the feeling of shame into a feeling of guilt 
because it is not possible to regret an evil action while 
being forced to commit the evil act in question. 
The freedom of conscience embraces only the right 
to reject any kind of cooperation that is considered evil 
by the person concerned. It does not embrace the right 
to hinder others in doing what the person concerned 
considers evil. Freedom of conscience does not establish 
a moral power over other agents and their actions, but 
only moral power over oneself and one’s own actions.

The Right to Freedom of Conscience12
12.1 The History of the Legal Concept 
“Conscience”
In this chapter, I want to deal with the right to freedom of 
conscience. It is interesting to note that national and inter￾national codifcations on human rights always address this 
right in the context of the right to religion. This becomes 
understandable when we consider the history of that right.
The concept of “Conscience” as a legal concept frst 
appeared in the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, which ended 
the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648. This was primarily a 
religious war between the Catholics and the Protestants of 
Central Europe, in particular in Germany. One of the 
most important aims of the Peace of Westphalia was to 
end the war and establish rules for living together for the 
two Christian denominations in order to avoid future wars 
based on religious reasons. Therefore, the contracting par￾ties accepted the freedom of their subjects to exercise reli￾gion according to their own “conscience.” The Peace of 
Westphalia guaranteed the freedom to exercise the reli￾gious rites that correspond to one’s own conscience in pri￾vate and in public.
The drafters of the two peace treaties considered con￾science a kind of inner organ which is able to conceive the 
commandments of God (see . Fig.  12.1). These com￾mandments referred to the way worship should be cele￾brated as well as to the way believers should treat their 
fellow humans. Conscience was therefore considered an 
organ that can receive knowledge about ritual as well as 
moral rules. The disagreements between the Christian 
denominations referred only to rules of rites and their 
attending theological ideas, and not to questions of moral￾ity. In terms of morality, there was no relevant difference 
between Catholics and Protestants. This was the reason 
Peace of Westphalia
The Right to Freedom of Conscience as a Privacy 
Right
The right to the freedom of conscience belongs to the 
group of privacy rights. It refers to the relation of a 
person with themself as a moral entity. Its function is 
the protection of this self-relation.
224 Chapter 12 · The Right to Freedom of Conscience12
. Fig. 12.1 Listen to God’s commandments
why the matter of the freedom of conscience was more or 
less identifed with the freedom of religious rites (in the 
frame of Catholicism and Protestantism).
Only a 100 years later in the time of the Enlightenment 
did this understanding of conscience became question￾able. First, philosophers realized that it is quite strange 
that Catholics and Protestants claim to hear the voice of 
God while hearing different things. The idea of conscience 
as an inner organ by which it is possible to receive mes￾sages from God became more and more implausible 
(Locke). The philosophers Samuel Pufendorf (1632–1694) 
and Christian Thomasius (1655–1728) were the frst who 
distinguished between religion, morality, and law. 
According to their opinion, religion refers to the duties 
toward God and morality refers to the rules toward one￾self, while law refers to duties towards the community and 
towards fellow humans. 
Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) distinguished further 
between morality and law, but for him the content of 
morality refers also to the community and to fellow 
humans. Only the reason behind the binding power of 
moral rules and legal rules is different. Moral rules are 
rules toward oneself which are to be fulflled toward oth￾ers. Legal rules are duties toward the community which 
are also to be fulflled toward others.
The German philosophers Christian Wolff (1679–
1754) and Immanuel Kant claimed that conscience is not 
an organ by which we can receive information from out￾side, but that it is part of our reason. In conscience, the 
Enlightenment
225
12.1 · The History of the Legal Concept “Conscience”12
voice of reason is heard. The philosophy of the 
Enlightenment was strongly focused on whether and to 
what extent it is possible to derive the moral rules from 
principles of reason. Rules concerning religious rites were 
considered quite irrational and delusional. This public 
reasoning about morality and religion led to a change of 
meaning of the concept of conscience. Conscience no lon￾ger had to do with religion or with the voice of God, but 
rather with morality and the voice of reason. A concept 
that correctly expressed the capacity to understand the 
religious rules of rituals and worship was no longer needed 
because the philosophers of the Enlightenment consid￾ered such rules as complete nonsense and superstition.
Only in the age of Romanticism, which lasted from the 
80s of the 18th century until the mid-19th century, did 
considerations about religion change again. The age of 
Romanticism was a cultural movement in Central Europe 
that affected all kinds of art (literature, painting, music) 
and had its center in Germany. Philosophy was not so 
emphasized in this age because philosophy is something 
related to reason while the spirit of the Romanticism was 
very critical of reason. Particularly the results of the 
French Revolution, which ended not in a rational state of 
freedom and equality but rather in a state of irrational ter￾rorism, led to this development. Irrationality in the form 
of feelings, emotions, and impressions became the focus 
of interest. Consequently, it is easy to understand that reli￾gion was taken more seriously than before. Religious ritu￾als were again considered something important and 
valuable. Nevertheless, as the occupation of the concept 
through the philosophy of the Enlightenment was too 
strong, it was not possible to re-establish the former mean￾ing of conscience as it was understood in the time before 
the age of the Enlightenment.
This situation became a problem when the State of 
Belgium was founded in the year 1830 and the Belgians 
had to draft a new Constitution (see . Fig. 12.2). They 
wanted to protect the free exercise of religion, but they 
could not use the term “conscience” in order to avoid the 
confusion associated with the concept of conscience after 
its treatment by Enlightenment philosophy. So, they found 
a completely new formula. This formula refers frstly to 
the freedom of worship and secondly to the freedom of 
expression. The frst refers to religious practice while the 
Romanticism
226 Chapter 12 · The Right to Freedom of Conscience12
. Fig. 12.2 Article 14 Belgian constitution of 7. Feb 1831
. Fig. 12.3 Article 9 (1) ECHR
latter refers to opinions of all matters, including, of course, 
religious matters. The concept of conscience was com￾pletely avoided. 
This new formula was partly taken over by the German 
Constitution of the Paulskirche of 1848 and the Prussian 
Constitution of 1850. In contrast to the Belgian 
Constitution, the new language took over the traditional 
formula of “faith and conscience”, respectively “con￾science and religion,” and added the new aspect of free 
exercise of religion. This new wording became part of the 
German stock of traditional constitutional formulas and 
is now part of Article 4 GG. After World War II, it found 
its way into the international human rights instruments 
including Article 9 ECHR (see . Fig. 12.3).
Here we again fnd the twin formula of “conscience 
and religion” and the additional explanation of what is 
meant by this formula.
Despite this history, the concept conscience provokes 
much confusion today, specifcally as to the meaning and 
the differences between religion and conscience. In 
Germany, this confusion lasted until 1960 when the 
German Federal Constitutional Court, for the frst time 
anywhere in the world – as far as I can see, distinguished 
the meaning of conscience from the meaning of religion 
and religious practice. Up to this date, the importance of 
the concept of conscience as a legal concept was not clear. 
It was debated whether it must be interpreted in the mean￾ing of the age of Enlightenment, or in the meaning of the 
Twin Formula
Defnition of 
“Conscience”
227
12.1 · The History of the Legal Concept “Conscience”12
age of the Reformation. So, we fnd case law of the ECtHR 
that still does not differentiate between religion and 
conscience. In a judgment of 2013, the Court says that 
“[r]eligious freedom is primarily a matter of individual 
thought and conscience.” In contrast to this confusion, the 
BVerfG distinguishes precisely between religion and con￾science by the following defnition of the term “con￾science”:
“‘Conscientious decision’ is any serious moral, i.e., 
based on the categories of ‘Good’ and ‘Evil’, decision, 
which is internally experienced by the individual con￾cerned as binding and as unconditionally obligating them 
in a certain situation, so that they cannot act against it 
without having serious moral distress.” This defnition 
shows that conscience does not have anything to do with 
being religious or not religious or with obedience or dis￾obedience toward rules of worship, but rather that it is 
about good and evil only. It refers to moral judgments and 
to the conviction of being bound to these judgments. 
12.2 The Mechanism of Conscience
The BVerfG stated that moral judgments, which are based 
on good and evil, lead to the sense of binding that appears 
in the serious distress that we feel when we act contrary to 
such judgments. What is it about this distress? Can we 
describe it more in detail? Yes, we can. The original kind 
of serious moral distress is the feeling of shame.
The feeling of shame was already a touched upon in 
the sixth chapter when we were considering whether it is 
possible for a person to be aware of their own personhood 
and at the same time deny the personhood of others. We 
said that it is possible, but nevertheless causes the feeling 
of moral shame which is a very serious kind of suffering. I 
think it makes sense to analyze the feeling of shame again 
and in more detail. This is necessary in order to adequately 
understand the function and relevance of the freedom of 
conscience. You will see that I do some repetitions, but I 
will also add some new aspects which can make things 
clearer.
Shame occurs not only as a reaction to moral failure. It 
can also occur in situations that have nothing to do with 
morality. In general, we can say that shame occurs if we 
feel rejected by others because they are aware of a serious 
defciency that we have. So, shame is the reaction to a cer￾Shame
228 Chapter 12 · The Right to Freedom of Conscience12
tain attitude of others toward ourselves. This is the atti￾tude of rejection. We feel shame in front of others who 
reject us. I set aside the very problematic case of shame 
that is not based on a real rejection by others, but only on 
our wrongly perceived belief of being rejected by others. 
Shame can be based on an error but it can also be based on 
a realistic assessment of the situation. For our purpose, it 
is suffcient to only address the cases of “realistic shame.”
It is important to understand that the rejection by oth￾ers alone is not suffcient for shame. Shame occurs only if 
a second element takes place. This second element is con￾stitutive. Others who qualify us as having defciencies use 
a certain standard of qualifcation according to which 
they can judge whether we have defciencies. Shame occurs 
only if we share these very standards. The rejection by oth￾ers lead only to feelings of shame if the awareness of being 
rejected reminds us that we reject ourselves because we 
share the opinion that we have important defciencies.
I will give you some examples. We feel shame if some￾one else rejects us because of our hair color or our body 
shape and if we share the opinion that our hair color or 
our body shape is defcient or otherwise not what it should 
be. If we feel rejected by others because they are not satis￾fed about the work that we have done, we feel shame if we 
share the opinion that we failed to do our work correctly. 
If we feel rejected by someone with whom we felt love, 
then we feel shame if we share the opinion that we really 
are not worth being loved. Considering that shame occurs 
only when we share the standard of qualifcation accord￾ing to which we show defciencies, it is possible to feel 
shame although there is nobody outside of ourselves who 
rejects us. We can feel shame simply because we reject our￾selves.
What is true for all kinds of non-moral shame is also 
true for moral shame. We do not feel moral shame only 
because we are blamed by others for acting contrary to 
moral standards. We feel moral shame only if we act con￾trary to the moral standards that we share with others. 
The standards of morality can cause moral shame only if 
they are integrated in our conscience. Conscience is (1) the 
knowledge of the standards of morality and (2) the con￾viction of being bound by them. Freedom of conscience 
thus refers to the freedom to not be coerced into acting 
contrary to the moral rules that the respective person con￾siders binding for themself. 
Moral Shame
229
12.2 · The Mechanism of Conscience12
Now we can ask why it is important to protect the free￾dom of conscience by a special human right.
All kinds of shame undermine our self-esteem. So, we 
feel a strong drive to avoid shame. A suffcient way of 
avoiding shame is to escape from situations that cause 
shame. Someone who feels shame because of their hair 
color can dye it. Someone who feels shame because of 
their body shape can either try to lose weight, do body 
building or participate in sports, or they can avoid meeting 
people and try to remain at home. Someone who feels 
shame because they have failed in their profession can 
change their job in order to become more successful and 
earn more appreciation. Someone who feels rejected as a 
lover can avoid romantic or sexual encounters with people, 
in which case they might suffer from loneliness but no lon￾ger from shame. However, strategies of this type fail when 
moral shame is involved. Avoidance strategies consist of 
changing one's life to avoid shame-inducing failure. Those 
who fail moral standards cannot simply change their lives. 
This is because moral standards refer to one's quality as a 
human being. The person who fails at being a good human 
being cannot simply change a role. Rather, they must cease 
to be a human being. The only way to do this is suicide.
You see here why moral shame is much more dramatic 
and much more serious as compared to any other kind of 
shame. But this is only one side of the coin. Most people 
who feel shame because of moral defciencies do not com￾mit suicide. Their drive to live is so strong that they search 
for strategies which allow them to avoid the pain of shame 
and nevertheless survive.
One of these strategies is – as we have seen in the sixth 
chapter – the strategy of displacement. In this case, we are 
making great efforts to forget our moral defciencies. But 
this is not as easy as it seems to be. It is hardly possible to 
simply forget moral defciencies because they affect our 
self-esteem in a very essential way. Therefore, displace￾ment is mostly a kind of replacement. We replace the 
awareness of our failure by the invention of something 
else that is easier to tolerate. We can, for example, invent 
the idea that we are not the subjects who were responsible 
for an evil act but rather somebody else. This was what the 
German people did after World War II. They replaced the 
moral shame of their horrible crimes during the Nazi￾controlled period with the idea that all these crimes were 
committed only by one perpetrator, Adolf Hitler. They 
considered themselves not just as mere cogwheels in the 
Avoiding Shame
Displacement
230 Chapter 12 · The Right to Freedom of Conscience12
hand of Hitler, but also as manipulated victims of his 
crimes. The real victims of their crimes were not recog￾nized as victims but rather they considered themselves vic￾tims. This made it easier for them to continue living 
without feeling moral shame.
Very often, it is not enough to simply replace the recol￾lection or memory. It is also necessary to replace the 
attending feelings. So, the feeling of shame is replaced by 
a feeling of anger, rage, or disgust. These feelings, how￾ever, need to be addressed. And because they avoid 
addressing their own evil actions, the feelings are then pro￾jected to somebody else. This “somebody else” could be 
the members of one’s own family. In this case, the person 
concerned avoids the pain of shame by treating others 
painfully. Although they no longer suffer themself, they 
allow or cause others to suffer. Another strategy is, for 
example, projecting these feelings to Jews, people of color, 
or foreigners. Still another possibility is to project the feel￾ings of anger or disgust to oneself, but not to oneself as 
the person who committed evil actions, but rather to some 
aspects of one’s personality that seem less than essential. 
This could be the body. In this case, the respective person 
has feelings of disgust or shame toward their own body 
instead of experiencing moral shame. One reaction to 
such feelings could, for example, be a certain obsessive 
washing or an obsessive and pedantic sense of order. In 
this case, the suffering remains with the respective person, 
but it is reduced to a level that does not affect the self￾esteem of the person as a whole. The consequence of this 
strategy is always a substantial reduction in the possibility 
of leading one’s own life on the basis of rational consider￾ations and refections. 
The psychoanalysts call such strategies of displace￾ment by replacement neuroses. The disadvantage of neu￾roses is that the suffering cannot be brought to an end. It 
continues forever. The only difference is that the neurotic 
kind of suffering seems to be less essential for the person 
and is easier to tolerate than the original moral shame. 
However, the price is high and to be paid for in the cur￾rency of self-alienation.
As you might remember from the sixth chapter, there is 
still another strategy. This is neither the surrender to moral 
shame by suicide nor the mere avoidance of moral shame 
by displacement and neuroses. It is, rather, the strategy of 
keep one’s head above water by the transformation of 
moral shame into a moral feeling of guilt. This transfor￾Feeling of Guilt
231
12.2 · The Mechanism of Conscience12
mation is the best and most sane strategy of handling 
moral self-rejection. It allows us to survive and at the same 
time to maintain our own authenticity.
Nevertheless, the opportunity to develop the feeling of 
moral guilt in order to avoid suicide or the loss of authen￾ticity is cut off if the respective person is coerced to com￾mit actions that confict with their own conscience and 
which are therefore considered as evil by them. In this 
case, the person feels moral shame without being able to 
transform it into guilt. After all, it is not possible to regret 
something and to strive for proving worthy of forgiveness 
as long as one is currently committing the evil action in 
question. The coercion to act contrary to one’s own con￾science forces the respective person either to commit sui￾cide or to avoid the feeling of shame by displacement, thus 
producing neuroses. Concerning the frst alternative, the 
coercion to act contrary to conscience appears as a strong 
disregard of the person’s existence. Concerning the second 
alternative, the coercion leads to a deep self-alienation. 
This is why we should understand that there is an urgent 
need for a right to not be forced to act against one’s own 
conscience. This is the meaning and function of the right 
to freedom of conscience.
12.3 Is the Right to Freedom of Conscience 
a Human Right?
Nevertheless, we must ask whether this right is really a 
human right. We have said that we can consider a right a 
human right only if the function of that right is to protect 
the necessary conditions of developing and maintaining 
personhood. I think we cannot say that someone who 
commits actions contrary to their own conscience is 
undermining their personhood. Indeed, the opposite is 
true. Only if we are persons and as long as we are persons 
are we able of acting contrary to our own conscience. 
Acting contrary to the conscience is an action for which 
the agent is responsible. Responsibility, however, can only 
be ascribed to a person and not to a non-person. In other 
words, if we would lose personhood by committing evil 
actions against our conscience there would never be some￾one who could be responsible for what they do or for what 
they have done. Conscience is an element of personhood 
and without personhood it is not possible to act contrary 
232 Chapter 12 · The Right to Freedom of Conscience12
to conscience. Without personhood, it is not possible to 
feel moral shame. So, the problem of conscience and 
shame disappears when personhood ceases to exist. This 
shows that there is no direct connection between the 
freedom of conscience and the conditions of personhood. 
Personhood is rather the precondition of a confict of con￾science. 
The protection scope of the freedom of conscience 
must be considered in another way. For this purpose, it is 
helpful to introduce a new concept into the study, namely 
that of personality. What is the difference between person￾hood and personality, and to what extent is there a con￾nection between the two?
Personhood refers to the entirety of the skills that are 
required for developing and maintaining a personality. 
Personality is the result of the application of personhood. 
By making use of our personhood, we produce a person￾ality. Personality can be modifed or replaced by another 
personality and the story of our biography consists of the 
development, modifcation, and replacement of personal￾ity. Personality refers, so to say, to the script of plays that 
we perform during our lifetime. It is obvious that the play 
which we perform when we are young is different from the 
play that we perform when we are retired. The life style of 
young people and old people is different because their per￾sonalities are different. Nevertheless, in most cases there is 
a slow development from the personality of the young per￾son to the personality of the older one. In other cases, the 
change of personality appears rather as a revolution. An 
impressive example concerns those people who had to face 
deep mortal agony while they were involved in a disaster. 
While they previously may have developed a personality 
that was characterized by frivolity and superfciality, their 
personality has changed abruptly after the disaster. They 
are now serious and careful, and they consider what really 
matters in life. Another example is the criminological re￾socialization thesis according to which prison has the 
function of supporting the inmates in changing their per￾sonality from a criminal one to a civic one.
The freedom to develop a personality according to 
one’s own choice is not protected by human rights. This is 
easy to understand when we consider the option of a 
developing criminal personality. It is obviously legitimate 
to oppress this option and the law does nothing else. Every 
legal order prohibits and suppresses some types of person￾Personality
233
12.3 · Is the Right to Freedom of Conscience a Human Right?12
. Fig. 12.4 Lawful and unlawful personalities
ality. The scope of alternative options for the development 
of personality is therefore restricted and can be restricted 
to a certain extent (see . Fig. 12.4).
However, the suppression of certain types of personal￾ity must not be without limits – otherwise, a violation of 
human rights occurs. We can understand this through an 
example. We can compare the abilities of personhood with 
the ability to walk. The ability to walk will be stunted and 
will result in the inability to walk when a person is pre￾vented from moving freely. A similar thing happens when 
a person is prevented from freely developing a personality. 
The ability of personhood becomes stunted, unless there is 
some space within which a free design of the personality is 
possible. So, the scope of free development of personality 
does not have to be unlimited, but the extent of the scope 
must be suffcient in order to maintain personhood. It 
must be wide enough in order to have a real choice to 
develop a personality with which the person can identify, 
so that they can say: “This is what I have made of myself! 
This is me!”
Personality is the result of all actions we have commit￾ted in the past of our life up to the present moment. 
Identity, which refers to the personality, is called the bio￾graphical or, according to a concept of Paul Ricœur, the 
narrative identity. What happens with the biographical 
identity when a person considers important actions in 
their lifetime as evil? In this case, the person also considers 
their personality evil. Considering one’s own personality 
as evil leads either to striving to change the personality or 
the attitude of self-negation (see . Fig. 12.5). In order to 
Biographical Identity
234 Chapter 12 · The Right to Freedom of Conscience12
. Fig. 12.5 Forced evil actions
avoid self-negation, the person has to regret their evil 
actions and re-establish a good personality. Where some￾one is coerced to act contrary to their own conscience, 
they cannot choose the frst option. They cannot regret. 
They are forced to self-negation. The script of a personal￾ity that is based on self-negation includes the quest for 
self-destruction. Suicidal tendencies or at least displace￾ment is a constitutional element of a personality that is 
self-negated. 
This shows that the coercion to commit actions con￾trary to one’s own conscience is not on the same level as 
any other restriction to the freedom to develop a personal￾ity. It affects not only the freedom to choose a personality, 
but also the freedom to develop and maintain person￾hood. Therefore, we come to the conclusion that the right 
to freedom of conscience is really a human right.
As we are at the end of this chapter, I want to stress an 
important fact. The reasons for a right to the freedom of 
conscience show that this right does not empower the 
holder to intervene in the actions of other fellow humans, 
regardless of whether these actions are considered evil by 
the respective person. The right to freedom of conscience 
does not entitle to a moral ruling over others. It guaran￾tees only moral sovereignty toward oneself. The right to 
freedom of conscience entitles a person only to refuse 
cooperation. Nobody may be coerced to actively cooper￾ate if the cooperation demands committing actions which 
are contrary to their conscience. This is the only content 
of the right to freedom of conscience. But nobody driven 
by their own conscience to fght for a better world is enti￾tled to disturb or sabotage the actions of others.

The Redundancy of the Right to Freedom of Religion
Insofar as freedom of religion refers to either the right 
to believe or not to believe, or the right to assemble for 
religious reasons, or establish and operate a religious 
association, it is redundant because the communication 
rights already cover these rights.
Insofar as the freedom of religion refers to the right 
to deny cooperation in accordance to one’s conscience, 
it is redundant because the right to freedom of con￾science already covers this right.
Only the core of spirituality (worship, rituals) can 
be considered as the possible subject matter of a spe￾cifc right to freedom of religion. Spirituality, however, 
can be considered the protection scope of a human 
right only if spirituality is a required condition for the 
maintenance of personhood and the avoidance of self￾alienation.
Religious Dualism
In principle, we can experience the world in two differ￾ent ways: (1) as a profane world which can be subjected 
to technical or communicative control, or (2) as a sacral 
world that cannot be subjected to any kind of control. 
The confrontation with the world as a whole (“the 
sacral”) occurs when we experience senseless and 
uncontrollably overwhelming suffering or injustice or 
when we become aware of our own death. The confron￾tation with the sacral world overwhelms us completely 
and makes us unable to lead an authentically self-deter￾mined life. Religious people are aware of both world￾views while people who are “religiously unmusical” 
(Max Weber) are only aware of the profane worldview. 
They do not (yet) have any experience with the sacral 
worldview. They believe that in principle, everything is 
controllable.
There is some evidence that the avoidance of the 
sacral worldview leads to particular substitutes which 
indicate a kind of self-alienation (e.g., consumism, 
political extremism, particular obsessions for career, 
money, sports, etc., or a particular infantilism like fan 
cults).
238 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
Religion as Spirituality
Religion is the entirety of all the techniques that, in the 
face of the sacral world, allow us to reestablish or 
maintain the capacity to authentic self-determination 
and thus avoid self-alienation. These techniques refer 
to the assimilation of the individual to the almighty 
power of the world, rather than to the adaptation of 
the world to our purposes and interests. Religion, in 
this meaning, should be called spirituality. Spirituality 
is to be distinguished from a concept of religion that 
refers to techniques that allow us to control the world 
by means of magic. Religion in this meaning strives to 
get power and control while spirituality renounce 
power and control because it considers such as sense￾less.
The Function of the Right to Freedom of Spirituality
The core function of the right to freedom of spiritual￾ity is the defense of the freedom of will against self￾alienation by protecting the access to the religious 
means of resilience. These means of resilience makes 
people able to cope with threats of overwhelming power 
of the world as a whole. Spirituality does not modify 
the world. It only modifes the respective person.
13.1 The Generality of Freedom of Religion
The former President of the German Federal 
Constitutional Court and later Federal President of the 
Federal Republic of Germany Roman Herzog noted in his 
commentary on the Basic Law that:
» If any basic right [of the Basic Law] ever is a direct con￾sequence of the principle of human dignity as it is 
declared as untouchable in Article 1 (1) and if any right 
ever is an inalienable and inviolable human right to whom 
Article 1 (2) refers to, then it is Article 4, which refers to 
the freedom of religion.
In making this comment, Herzog wanted to say that in no 
other case is it so evident that a particular right should be 
considered a human right as is the case with the right to 
The Religion of the 
Others
239
13.1 · The Generality of Freedom of Religion13
freedom of religion. I do not agree with him. It seems to 
me much more evident that the ban of torture or the free￾dom of expression are human rights.
I concede, however, that a person who is very religious 
will likely consider their religion and the freedom to the 
exercise their religion to be the most important matter of 
their life. A religious person might even be ready to sacri￾fce their life for the sake of their religion. Nevertheless, 
this does not show that the right to the freedom of religion 
is really a human right. A human right to freedom of reli￾gion demands – insofar as it should exist – respect toward 
the religious life of every human person. So, it is not about 
my religion, it is about the religion of others. Freedom of 
religion demands respect toward foreign or even strange 
religions. In other words, it demands respect for religions 
which are not my own.
We thus reach a serious problem when we consider the 
issue from the standpoint of Christendom or Islam. Both 
religions consider all other religions as being wrong—that 
is, they are based on misunderstandings, errors, or lies. 
Christendom as well as Islam claim that they are the one 
true religion and that every other religion is an error. From 
this point of view, it simply makes no sense to protect the 
belief and practice of religions that are based on wrong 
ideas. It is inconceivable that errors are constitutive of the 
development and maintenance of personhood. This prob￾lem is still more dramatic when we think about atheists. 
Atheists share the opinion that Christendom and Islam as 
well as every other religion are wrong practices based on 
wrong ideas. How should it be possible for an atheist to 
consider the right to the freedom of religion a human 
right?
13.2 The Freedom to Believe or Not 
to Believe
You may recall that the protection scope of the rights to 
free thoughts and expressions embrace not only the right 
to think and express true ideas, but also the right to think 
and express wrong ideas.
You are right. If we understand religion as consisting 
of a certain number of ideas and nothing else, and if we 
consider freedom of religion as the freedom to believe or 
not to believe in these ideas, then it is not relevant whether 
Christendom/Islam
Communication 
Rights
240 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
these ideas are true or wrong. The thinking and the expres￾sion of wrong ideas is protected by human rights. 
Nevertheless, for the purpose of the protection of the free 
exchange of religious ideas we do not need a special 
human right whose protection scope can be distinguished 
from the protection scope of the communication rights. 
The communication rights embrace all sorts of ideas, 
including religious ideas. The freedom to exchange reli￾gious ideas is therefore covered by these rights. The com￾munication rights guarantee the right to believe or not 
believe, the right to express one’s beliefs, the right to 
assemble with other believers, and the right to establish 
associations of believers (churches). So, the question 
arises, why should there be a special right to the freedom 
of religion aside from the ordinary communication rights.
The fact that the human rights codifcations contain a 
special human right for freedom of religion in addition to 
the communication rights is a product of history. A long 
time before the communication rights became a subject of 
human rights, the need for religious freedom of thought 
had already developed in Europe. This was a result of the 
religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, which 
brought untold suffering to the peoples of Europe and 
have taught them never again to run wars for religious rea￾sons. In order to avoid such wars, it was necessary to toler￾ate the strange religious ideas of others. Furthermore, 
many of those who were persecuted because of their reli￾gion fed across the Atlantic and established the United 
States of America. In the United States, the right to the 
freedom of religion has thus always played a very promi￾nent role.
The need for the freedom of communication relating 
not only to religious, but to all kinds of ideas, was only 
discovered during the course of the European 
Enlightenment. This development began in the seven￾teenth century, but led to the demand for appropriate 
human rights only toward the end of the eighteenth cen￾tury within the context of the American and French revo￾lutions. At that time, the right to freedom of religion 
within the meaning of a right that protects religious think￾ing was already well established such that it became com￾mon practice to assign the protection of religious ideas to 
the right to freedom of religion and the protection of all 
other ideas, especially of political ideas, to the communi￾cation rights. But a serious analysis shows that the free￾dom to believe in or to express religious ideas is only part 
Historical Reasons
241
13.2 · The Freedom to Believe or Not to Believe13
of the general freedom to believe in or to express all kinds 
of ideas. Therefore, from a systemic point of view there is 
no need for a special right to the freedom of religious 
belief.
13.3 The Freedom to Practice Religion
The communication rights, including the right to religious 
belief, refer only to the exchange of ideas. They apply to a 
pure intellectual world and not to the world of crude facts 
or situations beyond the world of ideas. The communica￾tion rights allow us to talk about everything. But they do 
not allow us to act in accordance with our ideas and to 
realize what we are thinking. We can have the idea that the 
world would be a better and more just place if we did not 
have to pay taxes. Regardless of whether this idea is right 
or wrong, this does not alter the fact that we have to do 
what the tax laws require. At least we cannot claim that the 
duty to pay taxes violates communication rights, because 
paying taxes is an act in the material world and beyond the 
world of pure ideas.
So, we can take the right to freedom of religion seri￾ously only if this right does not only refer to the intellec￾tual freedom but also to the freedom of a specifc kind of 
action, namely actions that can be considered as religious 
actions.
Especially from the viewpoint of those religions which 
are well established in Europe, we can determine that 
actions based on a certain religious motivation fall within 
the scope of morality. Christendom, Islam, and Judaism 
dominate in Europe. The latter is a minority religion, but 
its infuence on religious thinking goes far beyond the 
community of the Jewish people. Jewish thinking infu￾enced Christendom so strongly that it makes sense to 
speak about Christendom as a Jewish sect. Islam was also 
strongly infuenced by both Judaism and Christendom.
An important characteristic of Judaism is the idea that 
the exercise of religion primarily consists of the obedience 
to God. Obedience to God requires following rules estab￾lished by God that relate at least to the relationship 
between the members of the community, or more gener￾ally to the relationship between all members of mankind. 
These rules should therefore not be followed on the ground 
that they are useful for the acting person, but rather only 
Religious Ideas
Morality
242 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
because God has commanded them, regardless of whether 
they are useful. The believer fails to fulfll the meaning of 
their life if they disregard the commandments of God. 
Failure to comply with the God-given rules of living 
together is called a “sin.” The general term for the type of 
rules which are to be complied with regardless of the prac￾tical consequences for the agent and only in order to avoid 
the failure of the meaning of life, is the term morality. 
Rules of this type – regardless of whether or not they are 
considered as given by God – are called moral rules.
Moral rules are not the constituent element of every 
religion. They are typical only for Judaism, Christendom, 
and Islam. For other religions – like Hinduism, Buddhism, 
or all those religions that do not belong to the so-called 
“high forms” of religion – moral rules are based on tradi￾tion or on the teaching of wise men, but they are not con￾sidered as God-given.
It is now important to understand that the right to 
freedom of moral acting – regardless of whether it is based 
on religion – is covered by another wider-framed human 
right, namely the right to freedom of conscience. The sep￾aration of this right from the right to freedom of religion 
is, as we have seen in the last chapter, only a recent devel￾opment. It occurred only in the time after World War II 
and it has not been recognized everywhere in the world of 
legal or philosophical thinking about human rights until 
very recently. In the English-speaking world it is particu￾larly common to identify conscience with religion. An 
example for this is the title of a famous book of Martha 
Nussbaum: Liberty of Conscience. In Defense of America’s 
Tradition of Religious Equality (New York 2008). Another 
example is Jocelyn Maclure and Charles Taylor’s Laïcité et 
liberté de conscience (Montreal 2010).
This seems me to be a consequence of the fact that the 
protestant variation of Christendom is predominant in 
those countries and that moral rules as constituent ele￾ments of religion is a particular characteristic of protes￾tant variants of Christendom. A closer analysis shows, 
however, that freedom of conscience is much wider framed 
than the freedom to religiously motivated moral acting. 
This follows from the fact that morality cannot only be 
justifed on the basis of religious belief. Other sources of 
morality are also possible. So, we can conclude the follow￾ing: freedom of religion, as long as it refers to the freedom 
of moral acting, is embraced from the wider framed free￾243
13.3 · The Freedom to Practice Religion13
dom of conscience. So, there is no need to establish a spe￾cifc right to religion in order to guarantee protection of 
the freedom of religiously motivated moral acting.
But there is another kind of action that is very closely 
related to every religion. All religions embody certain 
practices that can be called ritual practice (rites). Rites are 
not only typical of some religions, rather they are constit￾uent for the concept of religion as such. Religion without 
rites is not conceivable. What are rites? Religious rites refer 
to worship, ritual sacrifces, adoration, prayers, singing, 
pilgrimage, fasting because of religious reasons, medita￾tion, and contemplation. We will see later that certain 
kinds of behavior directed at other people (charity) can 
also be considered ritual actions. If there is such a thing as 
a specifc protection scope of a right to freedom of reli￾gion, then it must refer to the freedom to commit ritual 
actions.
As we have worked out so far, human rights are, by 
defnition, rights that are dedicated to the aim of protect￾ing the essential conditions of becoming and being a per￾son, the conditions of personhood. From this follows that 
the right to freedom of religion can be considered a human 
right only if the carrying out of religious rites can be con￾sidered an essential condition of the development and 
maintenance of personhood. Otherwise, such a right can￾not be derived from the principle of human dignity and 
would therefore be only a simple positive right and not a 
human right.
13.4 Religious Practices 
and the Maintenance of Personhood
In the following, I will show that there is indeed an essen￾tial need for the freedom of religious ritual action in order 
to maintain personhood. For that reason, we have to clar￾ify the function of religious rites. Rites appear not only in 
the context of religion. Every exam celebration is a rite, an 
academic rite that happens at the end of every semester. In 
order to fnd out the specifc characteristics of religious 
rites, I frst want to inquire into the function of religion. I 
hold the opinion that the function of religion becomes 
clear when we draw attention to a fact that is typical for 
religious people.
Rites of Worship
244 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
. Fig. 13.2 Sacral places: pyramids of Giza
Religious people cherish a dual worldview. They distin￾guish the profane world from what I want to call the sacral
world. Many religions materialize this distinction by dis￾tinguishing between profane and sacral places, houses, 
mountains, woods, or waters (see . Figs. 13.1 and 13.2). 
This is a very archaic manner of thinking about religion, 
but it also appears in current religious life.
Does this topographic distinction between profane and 
non-profane give us a hint about the relevance of religion 
Dualistic Worldview
. Fig. 13.1 Profane places: skyline of Frankfurt
245
13.4 · Religious Practices and the Maintenance of Personhood13
in the maintenance of personhood? At frst glance, this is 
diffcult to see.
The so-called monotheistic religions (Judaism, 
Christendom, and Islam) also refer to the distinction 
between profane and non-profane (sacral). But they do 
not consider this distinction as a difference in space and 
time. Rather, they refer to the distinction between a mate￾rial world inside the space-time continuum and a world 
beyond the world in time and space (the Hereafter). In 
other words, monotheism differentiates between a pro￾fane, immanent world and a non-profane, transcendental 
world. This idea, which is characterized through a dou￾bling of the world, is very often connected to a ban of 
sacral images because sacral images tend towards an 
archaic worldview. The dualism of immanence and tran￾scendence is without doubt intellectually much more chal￾lenging. Nevertheless, even this idea does not demonstrate 
why religion should be an essential condition of the main￾tenance of personhood.
But before we give up all further attempts to think 
about the relevance of religion, we should frst ask 
whether there is a common basis in these two variants of 
dualism that may lead us to a deeper insight. The search 
for a common basis in the two variations of religious 
dualism shows that both interpret the dualism of pro￾fane and non-profane in an ontological manner. 
Ontology is a philosophical term. It is the name of the 
philosophical discipline which wants to determine the 
general structure of what exists in the world. In other 
words, the discipline concerns itself with the general 
structure of being as such. Ontological research is always 
developed in terms of an observer looking out to the 
world and its general structure. It is the view on an 
external object. Here is the observer and there is the 
observed world.
The opposite of an ontological approach is what we 
can call the perceptive approach. The perceptive approach 
is a look on an internal object. The perceptive approach 
does not ask what exists and what its general structure is. 
It asks instead “what do I perceive and what is the gen￾eral structure of my perception.” This internal view is a 
view that refects what happens inside of the perceiving 
person. The internally directed refection is the alterna￾tive to the externally directed ontological view. So, before 
246 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
. Fig. 13.3 “My Wife and my Mother-in-Law”. (© Public Domain 
(anonymous German postcard of 1888))
we give up the attempt to determine the relevance of reli￾gious dualism for the maintenance of personhood, we 
should frst investigate whether this relevance becomes 
clear from the position of a perceptive approach. 
According to this approach, the religious dualism refers 
not to two different kinds of being, but to two different 
kinds of perception.
A good way to understand the religious distinction 
between profane and non-profane is through a picture, 
frst published anonymously on a German postcard from 
1888. It is well known under the title “My Wife and my 
Mother-in-Law” (see . Fig.  13.3). This picture shows a 
woman. Some of you will identify a young woman who 
turns her gaze away from the viewer (“wife”). Others will 
see an elder woman with a hooked nose who turns her 
247
13.4 · Religious Practices and the Maintenance of Personhood13
gaze to the lower left edge of the picture. (“mother-in￾law”). If you concentrate on the image, you will likely see 
both women. However, one of the two characters will 
always be more in focus for you than the other – you will 
not see the young woman while you see the old one, and 
vice versa.
Just as you can see two different images despite there 
being ontologically only one image, so too it is possible to 
see the world in two different ways. Depending on the par￾ticular worldview which we choose, we are aware of differ￾ent worlds although there is ontologically only one world 
to be seen. We can thus distinguish the profane and the 
sacral worldview.
Let me shortly describe the profane worldview. The 
profane view of the world is analytical. We never see the 
whole, but only parts and relations between these parts. A 
fundamental analytical distinction is the distinction 
between me and the world around me. By distinguishing 
between me and the world around me, I understand myself 
as opposite to the world and not as part of the world. I 
understand myself as a being with a dynamic that is inde￾pendent from the dynamic of the world around me.
Another important analytic distinction is the distinc￾tion between the environment and the social world. 
Environment is the world insofar as every individual per￾son always stands in the center of that world. For me, my 
environment is only interesting to the extent that it relates 
to my needs, interests, advantages, risks, etc. The social 
world consists of all the other individuals around me who 
I recognize as fellow humans. We recognize our fellow 
humans as their own centers of their own environment, as 
means in themselves, as someone and not just as some￾thing.
Both the environment and the social world are primar￾ily controllable by us and disposable for us. We can talk to 
our fellow humans in order to fnd out their intentions, 
purposes, and desires. We can make arrangements with 
them in order to calculate their future behavior and we can 
try to infuence their future behavior by means of commu￾nication. The environment is technically controllable, pre￾dictable, and calculable by mindful experience or by 
scientifc methods.
Now let us turn to the non-profane way to see the 
world. I call this worldview the sacral one. The sacral view 
of the world is not analytical but holistic. By this view, we 
are aware of the world as a whole and not as a system of 
Profane Worldview
Sacral Worldview
248 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
parts. By exposing ourselves to the world as a whole, we 
lose the capacity to understand it as well as the capacity to 
control it and to dispose of it because understanding, con￾trolling, and disposing are possible only with regard to 
particular parts and aspects of the world and not toward 
the world as a whole.
The holistic view of the world is the original one. It is 
the view of the new born baby who is still not able to dis￾tinguish between themself and the world. As adults, we 
lose the capacity to distinguish between ourselves and the 
world if we watch the world through holistic glasses. We 
watch the world through holistic glasses if we experience 
senseless suffering, senseless injustice, or if we simply are 
aware of our own death. In such cases, we stop feeling as 
though we are opposite to the world. Instead, we feel our￾selves to be part of the world, as something rather than 
someone. If we watch the world through the holistic 
glasses, we lose the capacity to understand ourselves as the 
center of an environment. We also lose the capacity to 
understand ourselves as members of a social world 
because we lose every capacity to establish or to maintain 
any structure of sense and meaning. By recognizing the 
world as a whole, we experience a total loss of control. We 
meet with the world as a power that totally overwhelms us 
and forces us into a completely passive role. We cannot 
understand the world as a whole; we cannot maintain our 
self in front of the totality of the world; we cannot see any 
sense in world and life. We cannot rule the world anymore. 
By meeting with the world as a whole, we are deprived of 
every option to act. The American philosopher William 
James spoke about the experience of the “foods and 
waterspouts of God” that makes us into helpless victims.
Let us summarize the results of our considerations. In 
principle, we can experience the world in two different 
ways: (1) as a profane world which can be subjected to 
technical or communicative control, and (2) as a sacral 
world over which we have no control. Confrontation with 
the sacral world overwhelms us completely and makes us 
unable to lead an authentically self-determined life. 
Nevertheless, what has all this to do with religion?
Religion is the epitome of all the techniques that, in the 
face of the sacral world, allow us to reestablish or main￾tain the capacity to authentic self-determination. There 
are signifcant parallels between the experience of the 
sacral world and the experience of a psycho-trauma. 
Human beings suffer from psycho-traumata if they expe￾Function of Religion
249
13.4 · Religious Practices and the Maintenance of Personhood13
rience overwhelming violence (war, rape, torture) or if 
they experience overwhelming natural power (earth￾quakes, foods, being trapped under avalanches or in a 
mine) or if they suffer by completely wasting away in a 
hospital or in a prison. In all these cases, the victim experi￾ences a fundamental deprivation of control.
The discovery of psycho-trauma diseases which make 
people unable to lead a self-determined life is relatively 
new knowledge. It occurred in the second half of the twen￾tieth century. It is also relatively new knowledge that peo￾ple who suffer from psycho-traumatic experience are only 
able to heal themselves and reestablish their capacity to 
act authentically by their own powers (resilience) under 
certain conditions. Finally, medical and psychological 
methods have now been developed to help people who are 
not able to heal themselves. Interestingly, it has been 
shown that there are striking similarities between the con￾ditions and possibilities of healing the psychological 
trauma and the traditional means of religion. So, the fnd￾ings of modern psycho-traumatology allow for a better 
understanding of the function of religion.
From these considerations follows a very important 
insight. Religious practices do not pursue the aim of 
changing, ruling, or controlling the world. In front of the 
total almightiness of the sacral, there is no opportunity to 
change or control anything. The conception of a “political 
religion” is a contradiction in itself. Likewise, all forms of 
magic, although very often confused with religion, have 
nothing to do with it. Magic is a (mostly less successful) 
means of controlling the world. It belongs to the profane 
world and not to the sacral one. Religious practices do not 
aim to change or improve the world, but they pursue only 
the aim to change oneself in order to assimilate to the 
“foods and waterspouts of God.” A very intuitive image 
for this is that of bamboo, which a storm cannot break 
because it is fexible enough to bend with the wind (see 
. Fig. 13.4). The target of religious practices is to become 
fexible and porous and to not resist against the sacral in 
order to avoid destruction.
I will present only two examples of religious practices. 
Many religions are familiar with rituals of sacrifce. The 
purpose of sacrifce is to give away belongings in order to 
become independent of these belongings, so that you can￾not be destroyed if the sacral takes it from you. It is a strat￾egy of immunization and becoming resistant against the 
“storms and waterspouts of God.” The other example is 
Charity
Sacrifces
250 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
. Fig. 13.4 LAO-TSE, Tao-Tê-King 76, 182
charity. Some religions stress charity. Nevertheless, charity 
and sacrifces share the same idea. By turning to some￾body else in love, we don’t think ourselves too important 
anymore. We reduce, so to say, the stiffness and hardness 
of ourselves. We are not so busy with defending ourselves 
anymore. Rather, by having the needs of others in mind we 
become softer and more tender. By doing so, we earn more 
fexibility, similar to bamboo in a storm.
We can clarify the difference between profane acting 
and religious acting by using the terms adaption and 
assimilation. By acting in the profane world, we try to 
adapt the world to our purposes, interests, and needs. We 
change the world. By acting in the sacral world, we assim￾ilate ourselves to the overwhelming power of the sacral. 
We change ourselves. Religious practice is therefore the 
opposite of exercising power. The exercise of power serves 
the purpose of becoming stronger, more stable, in order to 
withstand the world and to rule it. Power is only meaning￾ful if we act in front of the profane world, not if we act in 
front of the sacral world. In front of the sacral world, the 
aim is not power but acceptance of our own powerless￾ness. Religious practices aim to maintain authentic self￾determination by conscious renunciation of power and 
control and assimilating oneself to the almightiness of the 
sacred by becoming porous for the “foods and water￾spouts of God.” In order to make that clear, it seems me to 
be more useful to rename the concept of freedom of reli￾gion as freedom of spirituality.
The aim of all practices which deserve to be called spir￾itual show the relevance of religion in the context of 
human rights. Religious (= spiritual) rites are necessary 
means of maintenance of authentic self-determination in 
251
13.4 · Religious Practices and the Maintenance of Personhood13
the confrontation with the sacral world. From this point 
of view, we have a suffcient standard to judge whether 
religious rites are appropriate and worth being protected 
or whether they are inappropriate and not worth being 
protected. It depends on their usefulness in coping with 
the sacral world. Usefulness, not truth, is the rational stan￾dard of religion. The rituals of different religions might be 
different and some of them appear to us strange, but we 
can nevertheless consider them as a subject of protection 
through human rights if they are useful to those who prac￾tice them. Neither the state nor other people can judge 
which rites someone may choose and practice as long as 
they are useful to them and not harmful.
Just as the state does not have the power to decide 
which scientifc theories are true and which are false, it 
does not have the power to decide which religious prac￾tices are helpful and useful to maintain the authentic self 
and which are not. From the states’ point of view, we can 
only say that both the sciences as well as the religions are 
necessary in order to lead a life with human dignity. 
Therefore, the state must protect both by recognizing a 
human right to free thoughts and free science as well as a 
human right to freedom of religion.
The aim of spirituality and the function of the right to 
freedom of spirituality shows that this right has something 
to do with the protection of ownership in one’s own per￾son. This is why this right can be assigned to the group of 
privacy rights.
Many people might question whether religious rites are 
actually necessary to maintain personhood in traumatic 
situations. Indeed, there are individuals who do well with￾out practicing religious rites. They do not need religious 
means of resilience even in traumatic life situations. 
Nevertheless, we should distinguish between those who 
are really “religiously unmusical” (Max Weber, Jürgen 
Habermas) and those who have no access to religious 
means because of a lack of religious education. The latter 
very often tend toward strange substitutes which indicate 
a kind of self-alienation. Instead of religious rites, they 
exercise other rites which are obviously not suffcient. 
They do not share a religious belief, but they observe the 
ideals of consumism, political extremism, particular 
obsessions (e.g., career, money, sport, etc.), or they share a 
particular infantilism like fan-cults.
But even if we think about those who are neither 
dependent on religious practices nor irrational substitutes, 
252 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
this does not preclude the adoption of a human right of 
religious freedom. There are also people who are not inter￾ested in expressing an opinion and do well without read￾ing a newspaper. Nevertheless, there is a human right to 
freedom of expression and a right to freedom of informa￾tion. There are people who do not want to go to meetings 
and do not want to belong to an association. Nevertheless, 
there is the right to freedom of assembly and association. 
Yes, there are even people who do not want to live any￾more. Nevertheless, there is a human right to life. So, why 
should there not be a human right to spirituality despite 
some people not making use of it? Furthermore, the right 
to freedom of religion includes not only the right to make 
use of religious means, but also the negative right to not be 
coerced into religious rites.
13.5 The Criticism of Case Law
With the end of this chapter, I want to apply the results to 
the example of the case law of the German Federal 
Constitutional Court concerning the Muslim headscarf. 
In its frst judgment on this matter from 2003, the Court 
decided that it was a violation of the right to freedom of 
religion when a candidature for a job as a teacher at a pub￾lic school is refused because the candidate wants to wear a 
Muslim headscarf. The Court held the opinion that the 
ban of Muslim headscarves for teachers during school 
hours is an unlawful restriction of the freedom of religion 
when there is no statute that allows such intervention in 
freedom of religion. Subsequently, some German states 
enacted laws according to which it prohibited teachers in 
public schools from wearing a Muslim headscarf during 
school hours.
In its decision of 2015, the Court cancelled the statute 
of the land of North Rhine-Westphalia by arguing that it 
is not in accordance with the right to freedom of religion 
to ban the Muslim headscarf simply on reason of abstract 
and generalized considerations. The ban would only be 
lawful if there is a suffcient concrete risk for disorder of 
the peace in school or for the neutrality of the state. Only 
if a teacher provokes severe trouble in the school by wear￾ing a headscarf can it be justifed to prohibit the wearing 
of the scarf. It depends thus on the extent of tolerance of 
the school community whether the freedom of religion of 
the respective Muslim teacher has to be respected.
Muslim Headscarf
253
13.5 · The Criticism of Case Law13
Nevertheless, there cannot be any doubt that the exer￾cise of a human right can never depend on the tolerance or 
intolerance of others. So, there is only one possibility of 
interpreting the judgments in accordance with a rational 
human rights doctrine. The Court obviously does not con￾sider the right to freedom of religion as a human right. 
The Court seems to think that exercising religion (by wear￾ing a headscarf) has nothing to do with the conditions of 
personhood or with the principle of human dignity. 
Freedom of religion falls only in the protection scope of 
freedom of action and not in the protection scope of free￾dom of will. Therefore, there is no absolute right to the 
freedom of religion and instead freedom of religion 
depends on other interests and can be determined only on 
a case-to-case basis according to the principle of propor￾tionality.
Are these judgments convincing? The frst question we 
have to ask is whether wearing a Muslim headscarf is a 
religious ritual that can be considered an appropriate 
means of assimilating to “the foods and waterspouts of 
God”.
At the very least, it is not entirely excluded that a pious 
woman understands the headscarf as a means of spiritual￾ity. A headscarf can be a means of spirituality if, like the 
knot in a handkerchief, it should remind the wearer of the 
overwhelming power of the sacred, and of the need to be 
permeable to “the foods and waterspouts of God” in all 
situations of her life. I cannot presume to know the moti￾vations behind every woman that wears a headscarf. 
Nevertheless, it is clear that if a woman says that she wears 
the headscarf exactly for this reason then it must be 
accepted as such.
Still, wearing a headscarf as a means to remind the 
wearer of its existence under the power of God is only 
protected by the right to freedom of religion if the ban 
leads to a sustained and deep devaluation of this means. 
But the function of the headscarf as a spiritual reminder is 
not really destroyed or devalued when a woman is hin￾dered from wearing it during some hours of the day. 
Therefore, the freedom of spirituality cannot be seriously 
threatened if a pious Muslim woman does not wear the 
headscarf for some hours during her worktime. Even if 
she wears the headscarf only in her free time, this will be 
suffcient to support her in maintaining a religious attitude 
toward her life.
Moral Considerations
254 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
. Fig. 13.5 Article 9 ECHR
But there is probably still another function of the 
Muslim headscarf. It can serve as a symbol by which the 
wearer confesses her belief, giving others an opportunity 
to refect on their own religious positions. In this case, the 
headscarf is a means of communication. As we have seen 
in the ninth chapter, communication rights do not provide 
privileged positions and chances to disseminate one’s own 
opinions in every setting. This is also true for religious 
opinions. Therefore, a teacher does not have the right to 
express her religious belief in front of a school class. She 
has no right to use the headscarf as a means of communi￾cation while working as a teacher in a public school.
This shows that prohibiting a teacher from wearing a 
Muslim headscarf during work hours is not a violation of 
the moral human right to spirituality. So, it can be made a 
matter of balancing against other interests, just as the 
Court did.
So much for the philosophical, i.e., moral consider￾ations about the Muslim headscarf case. Now I want to 
show you how the courts can deal with this case in terms 
of positive law. The Federal Constitutional Court is 
empowered to decide cases on the basis of the German 
Basic Law (GG). But frst, I want to show the legal argu￾mentation based on Article 9 of the ECHR, which is the 
basis of decisions of the ECtHR (see . Fig. 13.5).
Article 9 (1) ECHR shows that the protection scope of 
Article 9 (2) concerning the legal freedom of religion goes 
beyond what is required by the moral human right of free￾dom of religion. For only if the protection scope of the 
codifed right goes beyond the scope of the moral human 
right does paragraph two make any sense. Otherwise, the 
protection scope of paragraph one would refer to the core 
Legal Considerations
Article 9 ECHR
255
13.5 · The Criticism of Case Law13
. Fig. 13.6 Article 4 GG
of the human right to religion. As we have seen in previous 
chapters, restriction clauses are only acceptable if they do 
not refer to the core of a human right but to the yard of 
the right in question. From this consideration, we can con￾clude that a teacher wearing a Muslim headscarf during 
school lessons is covered by the yard of the protection 
scope of the freedom of religion according to Article 9 (1) 
ECHR.  Therefore, it is permissible to restrict this right 
according to paragraph two. A basis for a restriction of 
this right is also found in the principle of proportionality 
that is within the case law of the ECtHR. Thus, it might be 
justifable to say that the ban on wearing a Muslim heads￾carf is not proportionate for civil servants in a back offce, 
while it is proportionate for policewomen who must appear 
in uniform or for teachers in a public school.
The Federal Constitutional Court did not decide the 
headscarf case based on the ECHR, but rather based on 
Article 4 GG (see . Fig.  13.6). Article 4 GG does not 
have a restriction clause or a statutory reservation clause 
as other rights in the Basic Law have. Article 4 GG does 
not allow a restriction by law. From this follows that the 
protection scope of Article 4 GG must be interpreted dif￾ferently as compared to the protection scope of Article 9 
ECHR, namely much narrower. The protection scope of 
the codifed right here is exactly the same as the protection 
scope of the moral human right to spirituality. Considering 
that Article 4 GG protects only the core of the right to 
religion and because the headscarf case does not fall under 
the core of that right, we must conclude that this case does 
not fall under Article 4 GG. The headscarf case does not 
concern freedom of religion as defned by the Basic Law. 
The case refers only to Article 2 (1) GG, which protects the 
freedom of action under proviso of the rights of others 
and the principle of proportionality.
The Federal Constitutional Court has no clear concep￾tion of the term religion in Article 4 GG.  Therefore, its 
Article 4 GG
256 Chapter 13 · The Right to Spiritual Freedom13
decisions in this feld are not very convincing. As a result 
of the weak cogency, the case law of the BVerfG has some 
problems fnding acceptance in public. A deeper analysis 
of the concept religion by means of philosophy could 
improve the Court’s case law.
13.6 The Timeliness of Religious Freedom
The headscarf case is typical for cases concerning freedom 
of religion in democratic states under the rule of law. It 
shows that in decent states of this kind there is almost no 
serious confict that actually threatens the right to spiritu￾ality. This is easy to understand when we consider that a 
confict between spirituality and the public or political 
interest is hardly conceivable. For spirituality refers only 
to the renunciation of power and to the assimilation of the 
individual to the almighty. Spirituality claims no domina￾tion and no social infuence. It refers only to the self￾perfection of the individual person. This is not the only 
reason why the importance of religious freedom in free 
societies is declining. Historically, religious freedom was 
not so much about spirituality as about the power and 
infuence of competing religious communities and their 
domestication by the state. From this point of view, reli￾gious freedom is not to be understood as a human right, 
but rather as a requirement for tolerance that is intended 
to enable different religious communities to live together 
peacefully. This function is falling away as the political 
and cultural signifcance of traditional religious commu￾nities in the Western world is waning. This shows that cul￾tural development can lead not only to new human rights, 
but also to the obsolescence of old human rights.
Nevertheless, the opposite is true in authoritarian soci￾eties and states under the rule of dictatorship. In these 
societies and states, there is a high political claim to the 
total control of the individual. Spirituality immunizes the 
individual from such total control. Therefore, totalitarian 
and authoritarian states fght any kind of individual spiri￾tuality, or at least they want to decide for themselves what 
kind of spirituality they want to allow. It follows that the 
human right of spiritual freedom in such states is under 
pressure and the demand for spiritual freedom is of funda￾mental importance.

The Unique Character of the Right to Life
In contrast to any other human right, the right to life
seems to be a paradox. It seems to be impossible to vio￾late it. Before the holder of the right is killed, there is 
no violation of the right because the holder is still alive. 
After the act of killing, there is no violation of the right 
because there is nobody whose right could be violated. 
The holder of the right does not exist anymore and can 
therefore not be in a state of deprivation of person￾hood.
No Violation of the Killed Person
The thesis that the right to life cannot be understood as 
a relationship between obligee and obligor is contested 
by some arguments that are, however, not convincing.
The Existence-as-Attribute Thesis is not convincing 
because the termination of existence is not a kind of 
deprivation of one’s property. Existence is an ontologi￾cal transcendental and not an ontological category that 
serves the classifcation of entities.
The Basis Thesis (life as pre-condition of all human 
rights) is not convincing because the value of x does not 
justify the value of the factual situation in which x has 
a value. Human dignity and human rights are valuable 
in life, but they do not constitute the value of life.
The religious Sanctity Thesis (life as the property of 
God) is not convincing because it can only constitute a 
divine right to property of human lives, but not a sub￾jective human right to one’s own life.
The secular Man-as-Owner Thesis is based on a peti￾tio principii (circular argument) because it derives the 
ownership of life from the ownership of life.
The Deprivation Thesis is not convincing because 
the frustration of the desire to enjoy further periods of 
life is negligible. The length of time in which a living 
being is deprived of positive life experiences after death 
is infnite.
The Mortal Fear Argument fails because persons in 
mortal fear are still alive. They are victims of an cruel 
treatment but not victims of an act of killing.
260 Chapter 14 · The Right to Life14
The Function of the Human Right to Life
The killing of a person is not an attack against the per￾sonhood of the killed person, but it is an attack against 
the offender and all those who tolerate or support the 
act of killing. This follows from the Equiprimordiality 
Thesis.
14.1 The Codifcation of the Right to Life
This chapter deals with the human right to life. Many peo￾ple might think that it is simply evident that human life, 
the pure biological existence of a human person, is a sub￾ject of the protection scope of a human right and that 
philosophical refections are not needed to make this evi￾dence understandable. Nevertheless, we will promptly see 
that the right to life is different from the rest of the human 
rights and that this difference leads to certain specifc 
problems.
The right to life protects the holders of the right against 
any acts by which they would be deprived of their life. 
There are only two possible situations concerning the pro￾tection of life. Either someone is alive, or they are dead 
(because of an act of killing). There is nothing in between. 
Therefore, it does not make sense to distinguish between a 
core and a yard of the protection scope. This suggests that 
the codifcation of the right to life refers necessarily to the 
core of that right. There is no limitation or restriction 
imaginable that could refer only to the yard of that right, 
because for this right, there is no such thing. If the right to 
life has to be regarded as a human right, then it follows 
that this right cannot be supplemented by any kind of 
restriction clause or statutory reservation. If the right to 
life should be regarded as a human right, it must be 
regarded as an absolute right. If it is an absolute right, 
then there cannot be any kind of justifcation for a depri￾vation of life for whatever reason. Indeed, when we look at 
the codifed right to life in Article 3 UDHR, there is no 
such restriction clause.
Nevertheless, a closer look shows that the right to life 
was originally not regarded as a human right in the moral 
sense. The classical human rights codifcations of the Age 
of Enlightenment knew no right to life. Article 1 of the 
Virginia Bill of Rights speaks indeed of the right to the 
Core or Yard?
Right to the Resources 
of Life
261
14.1 · The Codifcation of the Right to Life14
“enjoyment of life and liberty”. But it was more about the 
right to seek happiness in life and not a guarantee of bio￾logical existence. Maximilien de Robespierre, the great 
slaughterer of the French Revolution, wanted to anchor 
the right to life in the French Constitution of 1793 as a 
primary human right. But he did not think of the inviola￾bility of biological existence, but of a right to the eco￾nomic subsistence minimum, i.e., a right to a good life. It is 
interesting to see that this idea is still alive. So, the UN 
Human Rights Committee hold in its recent commentary 
to Articles 6 ICPPR the opinion that the right to life not 
only embraces the entitlement to not be killed but also the 
right “to enjoy a life with dignity”. From the point of view 
that there is no human right to mere biological existence, 
it is not surprising that the codifcation of the right to life 
is subject to numerous exceptions. For instance, Article 2 
ECHR contains several restriction clauses (see 
. Fig. 14.1). It guarantees the right to life but allows at 
the same time the execution of the death penalty, as well as 
acts of killing when necessary for the defense of any per￾son from unlawful violence, to arrest someone, to prevent 
escape from detention, or in order to oppress a riot. A 
look at the German Basic Law confrms the result. Article 
2 (2) GG places the right to life under a general statutory 
reservation (see . Fig. 14.2).
The fact that the right to life was originally not regarded 
as a real human right is deeply rooted in the understand-

262 Chapter 14 · The Right to Life14
. Fig. 14.2 Article 2 (2) GG
Offender and Victim
ing of the individual’s position toward the community in 
which they are living. Traditionally, the human individual 
was considered only as a dependent part of their commu￾nity. Therefore, it was of no doubt that the community 
could demand the sacrifce of the individual’s life for the 
sake of the community. The idea that human individuals 
do not exist for the sake of the community, but that the 
community exists for the sake of the individuals, could 
only be developed slowly, and has only infuenced human 
rights codifcations since the 1980s. This development is 
refected in two Additional Protocols to the 
ECHR. Protocol No 6 of 28 April 1983 governs the abol￾ishment of the death penalty. Nevertheless, the contract￾ing states could not accept a complete abolishment. So, 
they agreed on exemptions for times of war or times of 
imminent threat of war. Only by revoking the reservation 
clause, which was done with the Additional Protocol No 
13 of 3 May 2002, was the abolishment of the death pen￾alty completed. This example shows that the conscious￾ness of human life as an absolute human right is not 
rooted in our traditional thinking.
14.2 The Unique Character of the Right 
to Life
Let us now turn to philosophical considerations of the 
issue. A deep philosophical analysis shows that the human 
right to life is indeed a very special one that is different 
from all the other human rights. This will become clear 
when we consider human rights as a kind of screenplay or 
script that defnes a specifc kind of interaction between at 
least two persons. One of these persons (A) plays the role 
of the perpetrator of an activity, which affects another 
person (B). B plays the role of the victim. The content of 
the perpetrator’s activity consists of shifting B to a state 
where there is a serious threat to B to be deprived of his 
263
14.2 · The Unique Character of the Right to Life14
personhood. We can briefy call this state an inhuman 
state. Bringing B into an inhuman state is to be considered 
a violation of one or more of B’s human rights. The perpe￾trator A is the person who is obliged to respect the human 
rights of B. So, we can call the victim B as the obligee of 
the right while the perpetrator A can be called the obligor 
of the right.
This is obviously not the script of the play that relates 
to the right to life. All the human rights we have discussed 
so far refer to a confict between an obligee and an obligor. 
In the case of the right to life, there is not such confict. 
For this right does not refer to a play with two actors A 
and B, but only to a play with one actor A. The act of kill￾ing by A does not move an obligee B into an inhuman situ￾ation. The act of killing does not produce a victim. Instead, 
the consequence of an act of killing is that the obligee dis￾appears. They do not exist anymore. Someone who does 
not exist cannot be in a particular state of life. It cannot be 
said that they are in either a human or an inhuman state. 
What we can say is that the death indeed destroys some￾thing, namely, both the living entity and all its properties 
including the attributes of personhood and personality. 
But there is no one who could have been deprived of some￾thing by this destruction.
I am not sure whether you will share this view or 
whether you would like to disagree. Indeed, there are sev￾eral arguments that suggest that the idea I have presented 
should be considered false. Subsequently, I will discuss 
these counterarguments with the hope that I can show that 
they are not convincing.
14.3 The Existence-as-Attribute Thesis
The frst counterargument refers to the meaning and func￾tion of certain concepts. It is therefore a purely philosoph￾ical argument. According to this argument, life is an 
attribute of a living entity. Therefore, it is possible to 
deprive a living entity of its life just as it is possible to 
deprive it of any other attribute or good that is protected 
by a human right. The deprivation of life, therefore, shifts 
the respective person into an inhuman state.
This argument is not convincing. It is based on a con￾fusion of our language. The grammatical structure of our 
language makes it possible to talk about existence in the 
same way that it is possible to talk about any attribute of 
No Victim
Confusion of Lan￾guage
264 Chapter 14 · The Right to Life14
a subject. The proposition “Socrates exists” (= “Socrates 
is existing”) and the proposition “Socrates is hungry” have 
the same grammatical structure. But a deeper philosophi￾cal analysis shows that existence cannot be considered as 
an attribute.
The classical philosophical Ontology 1 distinguished 
between ontological categories, which can be attributed to 
an entity, and the existence of the entity. Entities differ 
from each other through the attributes that are ascribed to 
them. Existence, however, is not a criterion of differentia￾tion but a concept that characterizes an entity as what it is, 
namely an entity. Being an entity and existing are different 
words for the same meaning. Therefore, it is not possible 
to say that an entity does not exist. This is impossible just 
as it is impossible to say that the line of a circle is not 
round but straight. In the language of philosophical 
Ontology, we distinguish between ontological transcenden￾tals and ontological categories. Existence is not a category 
but rather a transcendental. It does not serve the classifca￾tion of entities like categories do. Instead, it serves only 
the characterization of an entity as entity. So, in contrast 
to the grammatical structure, we can recognize that 
“Socrates is existing” and “Socrates is hungry” do not 
refer to the same ontological distinction. The frst sentence 
is a characterization. It says that there is something that is 
called “Socrates.” The latter is an attribution.
Now we understand the mistake in the frst argument. 
Being alive is not an attribute of a living entity, but it is the 
defnition of what is meant by a living entity. The 
consequence is that it is not possible to deprive a living 
entity of its life. The killing of a living entity does not lead 
to an expropriated living entity, but to the disappearance 
of the living entity.
1 The classical Ontology is the traditional philosophical doctrine of 
the most general structures of what is. That which is the being. 
Ontology assumes the possibility of an objective view of the world 
and its structures. Nevertheless, what we consider to be the most 
general structures of the being, are in fact the structures of our 
language and our thinking. Modern language-philosophy has 
inherited the legacy of medieval Ontology. Nevertheless, important 
ontological distinctions are still relevant today.
Categories and Char￾acterization
265
14.3 · The Existence-as-Attribute Thesis14
14.4 The Basis Thesis
The second counterargument relates to the fact that a liv￾ing entity that is endowed with the capacity to develop 
personhood is the necessary pre-condition of all human 
rights. Someone can only be a bearer of human rights if 
they exist. So, existence is the pre-condition that must be 
met in order to enjoy any human rights at all. The required 
pre-condition of all human rights must be considered as 
the protection scope of a human right. This is the right to 
life.
This argument was particularly used by the German 
Federal Constitutional Court when arguing in favor of an 
absolute right to life in the context of abortion. I quote the 
frst judgment of 1975:
» Within the constitutional order, life is a supreme value 
that is not needed to justify in detail; it is the vital basis of 
human dignity and the pre-condition of all other basic 
rights.
I think this argument is also not convincing. It is an error 
to believe that the substantive pre-conditions of an inter￾est must necessarily be an interest on its own. It is, how￾ever, easy to show that this idea is wrong. The opposite is 
true. The condition of an interest must not necessarily be 
an interest on its own. This is shown in the following 
example.
For someone who makes a fying trip, it is important 
and valuable that the plane is on time, that the food on 
board is not poisoned, and that the pilot is not drunk. 
Punctuality of the fight, the digestibility of the food, and 
the sobriety of the pilot are conditions for a successful 
fight. So, they have a value for me when I want to take a 
plane trip. But if I do not want to take a fight, then these 
conditions for a successful fight lose their value for me. 
From the importance of the conditions of a successful 
fight does not follow that the trip itself is important and 
valuable.
Let us apply this example to the case of human dignity 
and its pre-conditions. It is true that life is an important 
pre-condition for a life in a humane state and for the own￾ership of human rights. As long as you are alive and as 
long as you are interested in life, a human state of being 
alive and the holding of human rights are of absolute 
value for you. But if we have passed away, there is no inter￾Life as the Pre-condi￾tion of Personhood
266 Chapter 14 · The Right to Life14
est in human dignity and in human rights anymore because 
the entity which could have been interested in such does 
not exist anymore. Human dignity and human rights are 
valuable in life, but they do not constitute the value of life.
For those of you who have followed this lecture very 
attentively up to now, the suspicion might arise that there 
is a contradiction in this argument. You might remember 
my argumentation in the ffth chapter about the absolute￾ness of the value of personhood. I quote from one of the 
abstracts of this chapter: “Personal identity is absolutely 
valuable for every person because it is the prerequisite of 
any other evaluation …” I argued that personal identity 
(personhood) is the pre-condition of any kind of evalua￾tion and that everything loses its value when it comes to a 
deprivation of personhood. Therefore, I concluded that 
personhood is of absolute value for a person. In other 
words, I concluded the value of the pre-condition of every 
evaluation, namely the absolute value of personhood, 
from the value of every evaluation. Now I say in the con￾text of the right to life that it is logically not possible to 
conclude the value of its pre-condition (human life) from 
the value of a certain human practice. So, the question 
arises: is this a contradiction in my argumentation?
This would be a contradiction if I understood person￾hood or person in the sense of Johann Gottlieb Fichte. 
According to Fichte, person is to be understood as a sub￾stance (personal entity). The characterization of a person 
is personhood. Personhood is the emergence of a will. 
When a will emerges, the person attains self-awareness. If 
personhood fades away, then the substance of the person 
does not exist anymore. Nevertheless, this conception 
leads to the paradoxical idea that there is a state of knowl￾edge—awareness of oneself as a person—without a sub￾ject that has this knowledge. The subject of this knowledge 
is identical to the object of the knowledge. I therefore pre￾fer the idea that personhood should not be understood as 
a substance but as a (contingent) attribute of human 
beings. The subject or the bearer of personhood is the bio￾logical entity—the human being—and personhood is 
something that human beings can possess. If the biologi￾cal entity possesses personhood, then it develops 
self-awareness as a person. Otherwise, it does not.
So, you can understand why there is no confict between 
my thesis about personhood and my thesis about life. 
Personhood is a (contingent) attribute of living entities, 
while being alive is the characterization of a living entity. 
Fichte and Person￾hood as Entity
Personhood as Attri￾bute
267
14.4 · The Basis Thesis14
It is thus logical to conclude the value of an attribute from 
the value of another attribute which is the pre-condition 
of the former. But it is not possible to conclude the value 
of an attribute from the value of an entity that is charac￾terized as a living entity.
14.5 The Sanctity of Life Thesis
There are several different variations of the Sanctity of 
Life Thesis. We can distinguish a theological variant and 
two secular variants.
The theological argument claims that life belongs to 
God. That is, it is only borrowed from God. Its destruc￾tion is therefore a sin against God. From this follows a 
right to life.
I will not discuss the truth of any particular religious 
faith. This is not a theological lecture but a philosophical 
one. Thus, what can we say about this thesis from a purely 
philosophical point of view? The thesis claims that life is 
property, but not a property of the living entity but the 
property of someone else, namely of God. This is not 
problematic from a logical or ontological point of view. 
The thesis, however, does not meet the conditions of a 
foundation of the human right to life. It does not justify 
the right to life as a subjective right of a human individual. 
The thesis refers rather to a subjective right of God, 
namely, the right of ownership of the lives of human 
beings. According to this argument, human beings enjoy 
the protection of life only as a side-effect, but they are not 
the holders of the right to life. Consequently, this is not an 
argument in favor of a human right to life, but rather in 
favor of a divine right to life. Therefore, the argument can￾not serve as the foundation of the right to life as a human 
right.
An initial secular variant of the argument goes as fol￾lows: not God is the owner of a human life, but the human 
individual is the owner of its own life. Thus, it has its life 
at its disposal, and it claims the sole power of disposal. 
From this follows a right to life.
This argument suffers from a petitio principia fallacy 
(circular argument) because the conclusion is identical 
with the premise. The right of disposal over one’s own life 
is inferred from the right of disposal over on one’s own 
life.
Religious Variant
Ownership of Life
268 Chapter 14 · The Right to Life14
A second secular variant of the Sanctity of Life Thesis 
(deprivation thesis) goes as follows: homicide frustrates 
the victim’s desire to continue living. That frustration is an 
evil that the respective person suffers. Suppose a person 
lives 80  years. Typically, they have experienced a whole 
series of joyful feelings and adventures during these 
80  years that make their life seemingly worth living. If 
they had died at age of 40, their death would have deprived 
them of all the positive things that happened in the second 
half of their life. The supporters of the deprivation theory 
conclude from this idea that the victim of an action of kill￾ing suffers a loss (during their lifetime) that their right to 
life should protect against. This right, however, has a rela￾tive weight that varies between the different ages of 
humans. The sooner a human being dies, the greater the 
damage they suffer by the loss of positive future life expe￾riences that they otherwise would have been able to enjoy.
Upon closer examination, this argument is not as 
impressive as it frst appears. While it is true that those 
who die earlier are dead longer, the time difference is actu￾ally insignifcant. The length of time in which the living 
being is deprived of positive life experience after death is 
infnite. Even a natural death at 80 or 100 years old frus￾trates the desire to experience those positive things that 
would occur in the 81st, the 125th, or the 1013th year of 
age, and so on. From this perspective, an additional 40, 60, 
or 80 years of life are not worth mentioning. The depriva￾tion theory does not do what it claims to do. It does not 
provide reason for a right to life. Rather, it leads to the 
conclusion that it makes no essential difference whether 
and when a person dies, or if and when they are killed.
Perhaps behind the deprivation theory, however, stands 
an intuition that is not clearly and unequivocally expressed 
in the formulation of the theory. The evil of killing does 
not consist of the fact that death prevents future life, which 
the person would like to experience. The problem is rather 
that in the face of death all current life experiences and all 
plans lose their meaning and value. This argument, how￾ever, does not refer to the termination of life by killing as 
such. It refers to our general living condition where we are 
always living with the expectation of death.
Undoubtedly, we can concede that a person who is not 
tired of life suffers from the fact that they know to expect 
their death. Human life is largely related to the future. 
Everything we do refers to our future, regardless of 
Deprivation Theory
269
14.5 · The Sanctity of Life Thesis14
whether we think about our great life plans or only our 
short-term actions. In a certain sense, all our activities 
seem to lose their meaning if our future is limited. 
Thinking about our death, therefore, usually generates a 
specifc kind of sadness or even desperation. Nevertheless, 
the question is whether our state of mind when we think 
of our own death should be qualifed as inhumane and 
contrary to human dignity. Is the awareness of our mor￾tality and of the limitations of all meaning in life not 
rather a condition for a dignifed life? Death may be 
regarded as an evil because it removes meaning from life. 
But this evil is not the result of an intentional act of kill￾ing, but rather the consequence of our mortality. A human 
right to life and its strict observance cannot eliminate this 
evil. It makes no sense to consider the human right to life 
as a means of achieving immortality.
14.6 The Mortal Fear Thesis
The Mortal Fear Argument refers to the fact that persons 
who are threatened with killing feel mortal fear. Mortal 
fear indeed establishes a state of living in which person￾hood is in danger. Persons who feel mortal fear fall into a 
state of panic that deprives them of their ability to form 
free will based on their own considerations and refections 
such that they can live authentic lives. Protection against 
the evocation of mortal fear is therefore the content of the 
protection scope of a human right. But this is not the 
human right to life. It is rather the right to freedom from 
torture and cruel or inhuman and degrading treatment 
according to Article 3 ECHR. Mortal fear is something 
that is experienced while the person concerned is still liv￾ing. The evocation of mortal fear shifts the person to an 
inhuman state like in any other case of torture or cruel 
treatment.
The ECtHR consequently distinguishes between 
protection against mortal fear and protection of life. This 
distinction was made for the frst time in the famous case 
of Soering v. UK. The case was about a young German 
man who was to be extradited from the UK to the USA, 
where he had been accused of murder. At the time, the 
death penalty was still not prohibited under the ECHR 
because the sixth Additional Protocol was still not entered 
into force. So, the threat of the death penalty would not 
have been a reason to prohibit the extradition. But the 
Mortal Fear as Inhu￾man State
Case Law
270 Chapter 14 · The Right to Life14
court considered that the claimant would have to face a 
long period of time expecting his death and would there￾fore manifest the so-called death cell syndrome. This is a 
kind of permanent mortal fear that deprives a person of 
the ability to maintain personhood. The Court considered 
subjection to the death cell syndrome as a violation of 
Article 3 ECHR. Consequently, the accused could only be 
extradited to the US after the US government gave guar￾antees that he would not be sentenced to death.
14.7 The Function of the Right to Life
I come back to my initial thesis—a violation of the right 
to life does not produce a victim. Post death there is 
nobody who may be said to be in an inhuman state. In 
other words, it seems that the violation of the right to life 
does not produce any damage. So, I must ask again: how is 
it possible to understand the right to life as a human right?
I think the function of the right to life is not to protect 
the people being killed from an inhumane condition, but 
rather to protect those who no one wants to kill, but who 
have to live in a society where it is permitted to kill people 
if “good” reasons can be found for doing so. Because if it 
is permissible to kill humans if there are “good” reasons to 
be found for doing so, then the lives of those nobody 
wants to kill are only owed to certain “good” reasons and/
or the coincidental absence of reasons which would argue 
for their killing. Everyone in such a society knows that 
they are allowed to live only because there are currently 
more reasons for than against it in the eyes of the others. 
In a society where the absolute right to life is not recog￾nized, everyone knows that their life has only a relative 
value not only in the eyes of everyone else, but also in their 
own eyes. Each must be aware that they are ultimately val￾ued by others only for the beneft that their existence 
brings to society. The value of one’s own life always 
depends on the relative and contingent interest that soci￾ety has in the lives of its members. Such a state of law must 
be considered inhumane.
The absence of the absolute right to life leads to an 
attitude and character of people characterized by a lack of 
self-respect and a tendency to self-degradation. It is not 
possible to deny the absolute right to life and at the same 
time maintain a sense of one’s own and others’ human dig￾nity. The value that the members of such a society ascribe 
Consequences of the 
Absence of the Right 
to Life
271
14.7 · The Function of the Right to Life14
to themselves and to others can only be an instrumental 
value. The members of such a society will therefore also 
lose the language and the power to defend themselves 
against the violation of all other human rights.
In a sense, then, we can say that the function of the 
right to life is a symbolic one. The disregard of this right 
does not lead to physical injuries, but to mental and intel￾lectual injuries. This symbolic function of the human right 
to life makes the difference between a society whose mem￾bers are aware of their dignity and a society whose mem￾bers are not aware of it.
What applies to the right to life, however, also applies 
to all other human rights. We are used to always looking at 
the victim who passively suffers the violation when human 
rights are violated. But the violation of human rights 
always hurts not only the victims but also the perpetrators 
and those who are willing to tolerate the perpetrators and 
their actions. Both the perpetrators and those who tolerate 
them become, in turn, victims of any human rights viola￾tion. This is because acquiescence or indifference to a 
human rights violation leads to the loss of consciousness 
of being someone and not just something. This confrms 
the thesis of equiprimordiality (see 7 Chaps. 5 and 6). As 
you hopefully recall, this thesis explains why disregard and 
devaluation of the personhood of others inevitably leads 
to disregard and devaluation of one’s own personhood.
From these considerations follows that the right to life 
must indeed be considered a human right that protects the 
life of the human person from any kind of attack. There is 
no justifcation for the deprivation of life, at least not 
against or without the will of the person from whom life is 
to be taken.
The concrete violation or the abstract disregard of the 
human right to life leads to a symbolic devaluation of the 
personhood of all other members of society. Such acts of 
devaluation have very bad consequences for the perpetra￾tors and for the society that tolerates such acts. I have no 
doubt that the same is true for abortion. In the discussion 
about this issue, the only question is always whether the 
embryo is harmed by its destruction. But that is not what 
matters. In a society where abortion is a permissible option 
for family planning, every born human being must know 
that they owe their existence only to the contingent cir￾cumstance that there have been no suffciently serious rea￾sons against their existence. I am frmly convinced that 
Abortion
272 Chapter 14 · The Right to Life14
this knowledge is not without consequences for the per￾sonal self-confdence of people.
Nevertheless, the question arises whether there can 
also be acts of killing that are not connected with such 
devaluation. Suicide cannot be considered an act of killing 
that devalues the absolute status of the other members of 
society. Incidentally, this also applies to the assistance of 
suicide. Moreover, this also applies to killing on demand. 
A person who wishes to commit suicide or who wishes to 
be assisted in their suicide, or who asks to be killed, 
expresses a will that is guided by their own considerations 
and refections, unless specifc circumstances indicate oth￾erwise. Therefore, the free will of such a person deserves 
respect. Such respect can under no circumstances lead to a 
devaluation of the personhood of others.
A more problematic case refers to the so-called fnal 
rescue shot. Let’s take the example of a kidnapper threat￾ening to shoot a hostage every 10 min. Let’s say that they 
have done so several times. A sniper can prevent the next 
hostages from being killed by killing the kidnapper with a 
targeted shot. Is this a case where we can say that it is pos￾sible to kill a person without any devaluation of the dig￾nity of all other members of society? Can we say that the 
symbolic function of the right to life is not activated in this 
case? A similar question concerns the issue of killing in a 
war when the war is just, that is, a purely defensive war.
?Do You Still Remember?
1. The right to life has a unique character that distin￾guishes it from all the other human rights. What is 
the difference?
2. What is the core function of the right to life?
3. Is there a justifcation for the death penalty?
4. Is there a justifcation for assistance to suicide or acts 
of killing on demand?
For the answers, see 7 Chap. 21.

Social Human Rights and Liberal Human Rights
While the so-called classical or liberal human rights refer 
only to the respect for one’s human dignity and to the duty 
to refrain from any action by which the personhood of 
other persons could be damaged, the so-called social
human rights refer to the duty to do something, namely to 
establish living conditions that allow a dignifed life. 
According to the UDHR and the ICESCR of 1966, con￾ditions of that kind embrace guaranteed access to the sub￾sistence minimum, access to labor, fair working conditions 
and fair remuneration, access to an education system and 
to cultural life, and access to a healthy environment or a 
public health care system (“right to health”).
The Conditions of a Dignifed Life
If the life of a human being is epitomized by the daily 
struggle for survival which consumes almost all physi￾cal and mental power, then in this life there is no room 
for self-designed authentic self-determination on the 
basis of one’s own considerations and refections. 
Therefore, a suffcient subsistence minimum is a basic 
condition of a dignifed life.
If the life of a human being is epitomized by the 
daily struggle against pain or the obstacles of physical 
or mental disabilities which consume almost all physi￾cal and mental power, there is in this life no room for 
self-designed authentic self-determination on the basis 
of one’s own considerations and refections. Therefore, 
a healthy environment and an adequate health care sys￾tem are basic conditions of a dignifed life.
Education and access to the cultural life of society 
are the basic conditions of rational considerations. 
They protect against manipulation and widen the 
options for a life according one’s own life plans. A suf￾fcient and appropriate level of education and the 
access to the cultural life of the society are therefore a 
required condition for a dignifed life.
Labor must take place under fair conditions and be 
free from exploitation. These are required conditions of 
a dignifed life because otherwise the worker is deprived 
of the freedom of a self-designed life based on authen￾tic free will.
277
Social Human Rights15
The Right to Labor
Labor as such cannot be considered a required condi￾tion of a dignifed life. The idea of labor as an intrinsic 
value and basic condition of a dignifed life is deeply 
rooted in what Max Weber has called the “spirit of 
capitalism based on protestant ethics.” It is to be con￾sidered pure ideology. From this follows that, for exam￾ple, an unconditional basic income does not violate 
human dignity and is not a threat to a dignifed life.
“Social Human Rights” are not Rights!
The UDHR as well as the ICESCR of 1966 do not take 
the term “right” seriously. Article 22 UDHR does not 
oblige the states to recognize given moral rights, but it 
obliges the states to create the institutions to which eco￾nomic, social and cultural rights can guarantee access. 
This obligation is not mandatory and depends on the 
resources of each state.
Human Rights are Defensive Rights
Human rights always refer only to duties to refrain and 
never to duties to perform. This is because an obliga￾tion to perform cannot be absolute under any circum￾stances, because performance depends on three 
contingent conditions: (1) there must be suffcient 
resources; (2) it must be immoral to use the available 
resources for other purposes; (3) there must be no over￾burdening of the service provider. Rights to provide 
services can therefore only be created by positive law in 
consideration of these three preconditions.
278 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
State Goal Resolutions
The codifed so-called social human rights should be 
regarded as state goal resolutions. These goals are sup￾posed to establish stepwise dignifed living conditions 
for everyone. Dignifed living conditions are character￾ized by the availability of all resources and means 
which are necessary for the development and mainte￾nance of personhood.
Social Human Rights in Case Law
The aims of social human rights can also be achieved 
on the basis of pure liberal human rights. This is evi￾dent in the case law of the ECtHR (Judgment of 21 
January 2011—M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece—§§ 249, 
250, 263, 264). According to this judgement, the ban of 
cruel (“inhuman and degrading”) treatment (Article 3 
ECHR) involves a right to access to social institutions. 
Duties under Article 3 ECHR do not impose an obliga￾tion to do something but they impose an obligation to 
refrain from doing something, namely the exclusion of 
people in need from the social institutions which are 
dedicated to the aim of supporting people in such a 
situation.
Right to Water and Climate Protection
The right to water demanded in a UN resolution is, in 
terms of its function, also only a state policy objective.
The BVerfG ruling of 2021 on climate change 
claims a (fundamental) right to protection of health 
from the dangers of climate change, but does not actu￾ally fulfll this claim. In this respect, it is merely mis￾leading rhetoric.
279
Social Human Rights15
15.1 The Distinction Between Liberal 
and Social Human Rights
This lesson is dedicated to the so-called social human 
rights. The attribute “social” serves here to distinguish 
this group of human rights from the group of the so￾called liberal human rights. All the rights I have dealt 
with before in this book were liberal human rights. In 
principle, the difference between these two groups is not 
a difference in terms of the protection scope. Generally, 
we can say that the idea behind social human rights, as 
well as behind liberal human rights, is the protection of 
human dignity. The difference, however, is that the liberal 
rights refer to a prohibition. They prohibit the depriva￾tion of a specifc good that is necessary in order to main￾tain a state of living under humane conditions. The 
violation of liberal rights lead to a state of living under 
inhuman conditions, i.e., under conditions that contra￾dict human dignity. Liberal human rights refer to the 
duty to respect. Respect means to refrain from doing any 
action by which goods which are the basis of a life under 
humane conditions are deprived. The aim of liberal 
human rights is, so to say, to leave the world as it is. In 
contrast, the social human rights do not refer to omis￾sions, but rather to active actions. They command the 
production of those needed goods which are the basis of 
life under humane conditions. The aim of social human 
rights is, so to say, to change the world by improving the 
conditions of life in order to frst make a life under 
humane conditions even possible.
15.2 The Codifcation of Social Human 
Rights
The principle of social human rights is expressed in Article 
22 UDHR (see . Fig. 15.1). It is interesting to see that 
Article 22 seems to refer only to one human right, namely 
the right to social security. Furthermore, the states should 
only be obliged to make efforts at the national and inter￾national levels, within the resources available to them, to 
establish economic, social, and cultural rights. So, these 
latter rights are not immediately accessible. They must frst 
be established and this depends on the available number of 
resources.
UDHR
Omission v. Action
280 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
. Fig. 15.1 Article 22 UDHR
Right to Social 
Security
Resources and 
Allocations
In any case, according to the wording of Article 22, 
there seems to be a subjective right which is directly estab￾lished by that article, namely the right to social security.
Nevertheless, this “right” is also not meant as a real 
right on its own. Its content follows only from the following 
articles which refer to the right to labor (Article 23 UDHR), 
the right to rest and leisure from labor (Article 24 UDHR), 
the right to an adequate standard of living (Article 25 
UDHR), the right to education (Article 26 UDHR), and 
the right to participate in cultural life (Article 27 UDHR). 
So, in other words, the expression “right to social security” 
does not have any substantial meaning. It operates only as a 
collective name for the enumerated single social rights. 
Article 22 UDHR obviously does not refer to supra-posi￾tive moral rights, but only to a duty of the states to establish 
certain rights as far as it is possible and reasonable.
The consequence of this fact is that a lack of social 
human rights in a particular state does not indicate that 
the state in question does not respect human dignity and is 
therefore an unjust state. It indicates only that there are 
some defciencies. But it is not possible to classify these 
defciencies as a lack of morality. They could be simply 
caused by a lack of resources and therefore be morally 
indifferent. Furthermore, it is not possible to infer a cer￾tain morally required standard of human rights from a 
given number of resources. For it is legitimate to allocate a 
given number of resources in different ways. The alloca￾tion of given resources is largely a question of politics and 
not a question of morality because it can hardly be said 
that a certain kind of allocation is to be considered 
immoral. So, it is not only morally possible to only invest 
the resources for the realization of one or two social rights 
while the others are put aside, but also possible to com￾pletely use the resources for other aims and not fulfll the 
aims of Article 22 without any confict with morality. So, 
it is imaginable that a state invests all its available resources 
281
15.2 · The Codifcation of Social Human Rights15
for the sole aim of establishing public security or in favor 
of the protection of the country against natural disasters 
(e.g., by building dams and dikes), or perhaps also in favor 
of military defense in a particular situation of external 
threats.
There is another difference to liberal human rights. 
The obligor of liberal human rights is not only the state, 
but primarily every single person. The state is to be 
considered an obligor of liberal human rights only in a 
derived sense. In contrast, social human rights can only be 
addressed to the state. They aim to achieve social stan￾dards of living whose set up depends on resources which 
are always beyond the resources of single individuals. 
Institutions of social security are always based on a spe￾cifc common cooperation while the respect toward liberal 
human rights does not depend on any kind of social orga￾nization. The validity of liberal human rights does not 
depend on the existence of states. In contrast, social rights 
can only exist where there is a functioning state that can be 
the addressee of these rights. Liberal human rights can be 
violated regardless of whether there is a functioning state 
or whether there is an existing state at all. Social human 
rights presuppose the state as an addressee and that the 
respective state has established social institutions. The 
establishment of social institutions and the introduction 
of social human rights to access to them is, however, a 
question of positive law.
There is a third difference between social human rights 
and liberal human rights. Social human rights presuppose 
social cooperation within the framework of a functioning 
state. State cooperation or social cooperation within the 
framework of the state primarily serve the members of the 
cooperative community, i.e., those who participate in the 
cooperation through their own contributions. Therefore, 
in general, only the residents or citizens of the state are 
recognized as the bearers of social rights. This is expressed 
in Article 22 of the UDHR by the words “member of soci￾ety.” It is true that a state may also create social institu￾tions for people who are neither citizens nor residents and 
therefore do not participate in social cooperation. But in 
the frst place only the participants in the common coop￾eration will be considered as bearers of social rights on the 
national level, because these rights are only made possible 
by this cooperation. Insofar as third parties beneft from 
social institutions (e.g., foreigners, refugees, recipients of 
development aid, etc.), it is always a question of political

282 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
decision as to whom exactly these rights should be granted. 
In any case, what applies to liberal human rights does not 
apply to social human rights, namely that every person 
must be regarded as a bearer of these rights simply because 
they are a person. Being a person alone is not suffcient to 
justify access to a state’s social institutions.
From all this follows that the expression “rights” in 
Article 22 UDHR is not accurate. It does not express what 
is really at stake, but only creates false associations and 
unrealistic expectations, the disappointment of which is 
inevitable. If the term “social human rights” is neverthe￾less used in the following, this is solely due to the fact that 
this corresponds to the linguistic regulation of interna￾tional law. One must always bear in mind that these are 
not really human rights. One should actually speak of so￾called human rights.
15.3 The List of Codifed Social Human 
Rights
The UDHR enumerates four groups of social rights, 
which all together consist of thirteen particular rights:
1. Rights concerning labor (Articles 23 and 24)
(a) The right to labor
(b) The right to free choice of employment
(c) The right to just and favorable conditions of work
(d) The right to protection against unemployment
(e) The right to equal pay for equal work
(f) The right to a suffcient remuneration in order to 
ensure the subsistence minimum under humane 
conditions of life
(g) The right to form and to join trade unions
(h) The right to rest and leisure, including reason￾able limitation of working hours and periodic holi￾days with pay
2. Rights concerning the unconditional subsistence mini￾mum in the event of circumstances beyond one’s control. 
(Article 25)
3. The right to education (Article 26)
(a) The right to free access to elementary schooling
(b) The right to equal access to professional and higher 
education on the basis of merit
(c) The right of parents concerning the priority by 
choosing the kind of education for their children.
283
15.3 · The List of Codifed Social Human Rights15
4. The right to participate in the cultural life of the com￾munity (Article 27)
These rights declared in the UDHR were transformed 
into international binding law by the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights of 16 
December 1966. In contrast to the UDHR, the Covenant 
of 1966 added a ffth group of rights (Article 12), namely:
5. The right “to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health” (right to health)
There are also several international conventions that pro￾vide additional rights to this corpus of social human 
rights, for example, the right to educational promotion of 
handicapped children (Article 23 UN Convention on the 
Rights of the Child—CRC). The ECHR does not contain 
social human rights. The members of the Council of 
Europe agreed, however, on the European Social Charter 
of 18 October 1961 and its three additional protocols from 
1988, 1991, and 1995.
The legally binding nature of the ICESCR and the 
other international covenants in which social human 
rights are agreed upon does not change the fact that these 
are also not genuine subjective rights to which every 
human being is entitled to by virtue of being human. The 
legally binding nature of these rights relates only to the 
relationship between the signatory states. In the treaties, 
the latter have undertaken to give account of their social 
policy to the other contracting parties and to the interna￾tional agencies created by the treaties and to face the criti￾cism of the international community.
15.4 The Goods of the Social Human Rights 
and Its Relevance for Humane Living 
Conditions
We should now briefy consider whether the codifed social 
rights, whether or not they contain genuine rights, in any 
case address protective goods whose availability must be 
regarded as a necessary condition for a life in dignity, so 
that we can say that the lack of these goods makes a living 
situation inhumane, so that this lack should be overcome 
if possible.
Subsistence Minimum
284 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
First, we can ask whether from the viewpoint of human 
dignity there is a strong desire to guarantee access for all 
persons to a subsistence minimum. The subsistence mini￾mum embraces enough food, clothing, and 
accommodation. I think it is indeed obvious that there is a 
very close connection between the subsistence minimum 
and a dignifed state of living. Someone who suffers from 
a lack of the minimum of food that is needed for the main￾tenance of physical life is not able to lead their life based 
on an authentic will. Their life is completely flled with the 
search for food if they are not already too weak to look for 
food and can thus only vegetate. Someone who is home￾less and lives on the streets will suffer from a lack of pri￾vacy and basic security, which prevents them from relaxing 
and coming to themself. So, it is obvious that the subsis￾tence minimum is indeed a necessary condition of a digni￾fed state of life.
The same thing becomes clear when we consider a 
severe lack of health. Living in severe illness or with severe 
handicaps or diseases hinders persons from leading their 
own life on the basis of their own considerations and 
refections because all their strength and all their mental as 
well as physical energy is focused on the suffering of pain 
or the surmounting of everyday obstacles. I think this is so 
obvious that there is no need for more detailed explana￾tions.
But what is about education? Article 26 (2) UDHR 
provides a useful hint regarding this question (see 
. Fig.  15.2). In particular, the frst sentence shows why 
education is closely connected with a dignifed state of life. 
Education provides the means that someone must apply 
when considering and refecting upon and creating their 
own free will. The ability to produce an authentic will 
depends on the ability to collect information and the 
appropriate consideration of such. This requires the abil￾ity of intellectual analysis which is based on a proper 
Health Care
Education

285
15.4 · The Goods of the Social Human Rights and Its Relevance…15
capacity to use language. The development of a suff￾ciently sophisticated language is the most important aim 
of education as long as it is to be directed to the full devel￾opment of personhood and the ability to create an authen￾tic personality.
Another aim of education must be the strengthening 
of respect for human rights. This is also a necessary condi￾tion for the development of an authentic personality 
because only the consciousness of human rights and 
human dignity makes a person able to refect upon person￾hood and the absolute value of the personhood of oneself 
and of others. Education about human rights leads to the 
consciousness of personhood and of the fragility of per￾sonhood. It makes a person aware of the risks and threats 
to personhood and vigilant of the protection of person￾hood. Above all, it also provides the language that enables 
people to express their own human rights concerns and 
assert them in society. These are the conditions under 
which it is frst possible to make use of human rights.
The right to participate in the cultural life of the com￾munity is a condition of communication and a necessary 
means for real utilization of the communication rights. 
Someone who is excluded from the cultural life of the 
community is not able to consider all the available aspects 
that are relevant for their life plan and that are, in princi￾ple, available in the community. So, exclusion functions as 
a sort of manipulation of the will of the excluded indi￾viduals.
So, we can recognize that the right to subsistence mini￾mum, the right to health, the right to education, and the 
right to participate in cultural life indeed serve a standard 
of living where persons can freely develop their personal￾ity on the basis of their own considerations and refections 
to lead a dignifed life.
But what about the right to labor? In the states shaped 
by Marxist–Leninist ideology, the right to labor has actu￾ally been realized. For example, in the German Democratic 
Republic, which existed between 1949 and 1990, there was 
also a job guarantee linked to a minimum wage. It led to 
chronic loss-making businesses and a massive loss of pros￾perity. However, this is not an argument against the right 
to labor. If human dignity demands this right, then losses 
in prosperity must also be accepted for the sake of this 
absolute value. However, a decent life is conceivable even 
without paid employment.
Cultural Life
Right to Labor?
286 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
I guess that the idea according to which labor is consid￾ered an intrinsic value and even a good that is a necessary 
condition of a humane state of living is based on a certain 
ideology which is typical for the cultural identity of the 
societies of Central and Northern Europe as well as in the 
Anglo-Saxon hemisphere. This ideology goes back to the 
times of the European Renaissance and is closely con￾nected with the history of the Reformation. The 
Reformation movement was strongly infuenced not only 
by Martin Luther (1483–1546) but also by the Swiss theo￾logians Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531) and Johannes 
(Jean) Calvin (1509–1564). In addition, I should mention 
the Scottish reformer John Knox (1514–1572). Their great 
infuence in the development of the Central European 
assessment of labor was analyzed by the famous German 
sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920) in his 1904/05 work 
The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.
According to Weber, the basic idea of the protestant 
work ethos is that labor has value in itself. We should not 
work only because it is necessary to work in order to 
ensure our livelihood, but because labor is the meaning of 
life. It is not possible to live a meaningful human life with￾out working. This idea is in particular confrmed by the 
teachings of Jean Calvin. They consist of fve points, 
among them the points of total depravity and uncondi￾tional election.
Total depravity means that human beings by nature are 
not able to understand the holy scripts and that they there￾fore are damned to go to hell after their death. Only few 
numbers of human beings are unconditionally elected by 
God. They will rise on the last day and come to heaven. 
Those people who are elected by God are already identif￾able during their life on earth. They are, so to say, marked 
by their successful and pious life on earth. Therefore, if 
there is a person who is very successful in business and 
enjoys economic wealth, it can be concluded that this per￾son has been elected by God. The belief in these teachings 
led to a strong motivation to be diligent and industrious 
and always pursue economic success. People did not pur￾sue wealth in order to enjoy their life by consuming their 
money. Instead, they worked in order to get money that 
could be invested in new industrial equipment in order to 
get more money that could be invested to get still more 
money, etc. They lived very simple, modest and frugal and 
tried to work and to work and to work. They invested the 
results of their work always in new ventures and continued 
Calvinist Ideology
287
15.4 · The Goods of the Social Human Rights and Its Relevance…15
to work in order to confrm to themselves and to the soci￾ety that they had been elected by God.
So not only they but the entire society became more 
and more rich. The protestant spirit of capitalism fnally 
led to the big industrial states in England, in the United 
States, in The Netherlands and in the Scandinavian coun￾tries as well as in some parts of Germany. At the end of 
the nineteenth century, it was obvious that the protestant 
countries had achieved a much higher standard in terms 
of economy and industrialization then the catholic coun￾tries around the world. In Germany, one could easily see 
that the protestant parts of the country were much richer 
than the catholic parts. The idea that labor has an intrinsic 
value was a pure ideology. But this ideology was very use￾ful to develop the country. So, it is at least partly true to 
say that our current economic wealth is based on a very 
strange ideology of the sixteenth century. And the most 
important part of that ideology was the idea of the intrin￾sic value of labor.
Protestant ethics has not only strongly infuenced cen￾tral and western European as well as American capital￾ism0., but also the labor ethos in the context of Socialism 
and Communism. So, labor was also considered in the 
Soviet communism as the core of the meaning of life. Only 
a worker was considered as a member of society that could 
be taken seriously and that could expect some respect.
The current infuence of the protestant ethics is clear to 
see in the context of the debate about an unconditional 
basic income (UBI). Although everybody knows that the 
increasing automatization of the industrial production as 
well as of huge parts of what is called the services sector 
will very soon lead to increasing unemployment, these 
changes are not like those of the past, which resulted from 
regular economic fuctuations. These current changes are 
characterized by a deep systemic change in the structure 
of production. As a result, opportunities to fnd paid labor 
are diminishing. We can observe a strong resistance in par￾ticular from representatives of trade unions and political 
parties of the left wing against UBI. For them, the value 
of labor is not only an extrinsic one. Labor is for them not 
only a means of survival under certain social conditions. It 
is rather an intrinsic value. For them, labor has value in 
itself. Therefore, they cannot imagine a society in a digni￾fed state of living that is not based on labor, but on 
automatization.

Unconditional Basic 
Income
288 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
It is obvious that this idea is completely different from 
the attitude toward labor that is common outside of the 
Protestant culture. In Catholic countries like Italy or in 
orthodox countries like Greece nobody would share this 
idea. Outside the Protestant culture, labor is considered 
only as a means of life that is largely unavoidable. But it is 
not an end in itself. In other words, outside Protestant eth￾ics it is not understandable why labor should be a 
constituent condition of a dignifed state of life. This is 
why I think that labor is not really a required condition of 
a dignifed life under every conceivable circumstances. The 
right to labor is therefore rather to be considered a fake 
human right. In 7 Chap. 17, I will present some addi￾tional fake human rights.
In order to avoid misunderstandings, I want to add 
that it is of course an attack on the freedom of a person to 
prevent them from working when there is work available 
and when they need to work in order to earn their liveli￾hood. On the other hand, if the economic situation is such 
that labor is not needed, in other words, when there is no 
demand of labor, then there is no violation of any right 
even if the person concerned would like to work. In con￾trary, it would be simply nonsense to establish opportuni￾ties for work without any economic demand for work.
I will not discuss the codifed rights concerning decent 
working conditions further below. They are only partly 
rights to a beneft (e.g. paid leave). The other part are 
rights to omission (e.g., exploitation by too low wages). In 
the following, we will focus on the rights to a minimum 
subsistence level, education and health.
15.5 Addressees of Social Human Rights
Now I want to come to the philosophical core questions 
related to the so-called social human rights. As we have seen 
before, the expression “right” makes less sense in combina￾tion with “to health” or “to education” because such a right 
can only be understood as a right to access to institutions of 
healthcare or institutions of education. And these institu￾tions must frst be established before access to them can be 
available and a right to access can be conceivable.
This suggests that social human rights should perhaps 
be understood rather as rights to the creation of the social 
institutions in question. This presupposes that someone 
has the duty to create such institutions, and to do so suf￾Supra-positive Duty 
to Set Up Social 
Institutions
289
15.5 · Addressees of Social Human Rights…15
fciently so that all people can have access to them. After 
all, these are supposed to be human rights and not merely 
rights for the citizens of a state or for some otherwise 
defned subset of humanity. We have already seen above 
that in the presently codifed human rights catalogs, 
including the ICSECR, such duties have not been 
enshrined. Nevertheless, from a philosophical point of 
view, it is possible and reasonable to ask whether there is a 
superpositive duty, derivable from the principle of human 
dignity, to create social institutions in suffcient number 
and quality, which serve to ensure humane living condi￾tions for all human beings.
Individuals can hardly be obliged to do this, because 
no one would have the power and the means to fulfll such 
an obligation. Rather, the establishment of a suffciently 
effcient social infrastructure requires the cooperation of 
many who are collectively capable of doing so. Before such 
communities are established, they cannot be addressees of 
duties because they do not exist. There is also no individ￾ual duty of all individuals derivable from human dignity 
to found such communities. This is because no individual 
human being has the power and the ability to make all 
others or a suffciently large part of all others cooperate. 
Each person bears responsibility only for themself and not 
for what others do or do not do.
This only leaves the question of whether the duty to 
create a social infrastructure available to all mankind can 
be addressed to communities that already exist today. The 
states are the frst to come into consideration for this, at 
least those states which are above average wealthy and 
powerful. However, there is currently not a single state in 
the world whose power and wealth would be suffcient to 
ensure a minimum subsistence level for all humanity and 
to provide access to health care and education. If at all, 
only an alliance would be able to do this, which would 
have to consist of all states, if possible, or at least of the 
wealthier states. Such an alliance does not exist at present. 
No individual state can have the obligation to found such 
a network. In this respect, nothing else is true other than 
what has already been said on the question of whether 
individuals can be obliged to establish cooperative com￾munities. These considerations show that the concept of 
social human rights already fails because no one actor can 
be named who can bear the corresponding obligations.
290 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
15.6 Duties to Refrain from Doing 
Something and Duties To Do 
Something
The above considerations, however, lead to far more fun￾damental fndings. If human rights are absolute subjective 
rights that must be fulflled without any ifs and buts, then 
this already rules out the possibility that there can be 
human rights to active acts. Human rights always and 
exclusively refer to duties of omission. Therefore, the con￾cept of social human rights is already conceptually impos￾sible.
However, this applies not only to social human rights, 
but also to human rights obligations to protect, which are 
assumed by states. Such an assumption of duty is found in 
Article 1 (1) of the Basic Law (see . Fig.  15.3). In the 
second sentence of this norm, the duty of the state to 
respect human dignity and the duty of the state to protect 
human dignity are placed on an equal footing. This means 
that the state is not only obliged to refrain from any inter￾ference with or violation of human rights, but also to take 
active measures to prevent third parties from violating 
human rights.
In this respect, the Basic Law makes no distinction 
between refraining and doing. Not only the duty to respect 
but also the duty to protect apply absolutely. If one takes 
Article 1 (1) sentence 2 GG seriously, the state acts uncon￾stitutionally if human rights violations by third parties 
occur on its territory and it does not take (suffcient) pro￾tective measures against them. If the state fails to provide 
protection, this constitutes a breach of duty on the part of 
the state, which should lead to corresponding claims for 
damages.
The idea of the equal status of omission and action in 
the frst article of the Basic Law is based on an intellectual 
fallacy, namely the lack of differentiation between desires 
and duties. The concept of human dignity, as we saw in 
7 Chap. 6, refers to something we desire because it has an 
absolute value for us. Human rights, on the other hand, 
Omissions/Actions
Art. 1 (1) GG
Human dignity shall be inviolable.To respect and
protect it shall be the duty of all state authority.
. Fig. 15.3 Article 1 (1) GG
291
15.6 · Duties to Refrain from Doing Something and Duties...15
refer to duties. However, the value of human dignity can￾not be fully transformed into human duties. Our power to 
desire is, in principle, infnite. We can wish to be an angel 
or to travel to the center of the earth. In contrast, our 
power to act is very limited. We feel the absolute value of 
personhood as an inner compulsion, that is, as a duty to 
respect, protect, and enable it at all costs. But this pressure 
felt before the conscience remains ineffective if the duty 
demands something beyond our ability (ultra posse nemo 
obligatur). Duties are thus conceivable only within the 
framework of what we are capable of doing. It is true that 
one might think that the absolute value of humane living 
conditions requires every human being to devote all of 
their energy to the creation and defense of humane living 
conditions for all human beings. However, no single per￾son is in a position to ensure humane living conditions for 
all people in need. When we decide to help people in need, 
we are always forced to choose whom to help, in what way, 
and to what extent. There is no rule for this choice, so the 
question of what we are obliged to do cannot be answered 
by such a rule. Discretion is always necessary. But when 
discretion comes into play, there can be no compulsion to 
do anything in particular, and consequently there can be 
no duty.
What applies to the individual in this respect also 
applies to the state. States are not omnipotent either. Their 
possibilities are limited and therefore it is inevitably a mat￾ter of political discretion whether and to what extent the 
state grants protection against human rights violations by 
third parties, or establishes social institutions in order to 
thereby create humane living conditions. Therefore, the 
state is not acting unconstitutionally if it chooses, for 
example, to refrain from a strict lockdown and keep work￾places or schools open, even though this increases the risk 
for vulnerable groups to be infected by and die from 
Covid-19. It is a matter of political choice how far health 
protection goes in this respect.
This legislative discretion must also be taken into 
account when discussing the medical ethics issue of triage. 
There can be no absolute duty to rescue seriously ill or 
wounded people and consequently there is no correspond￾ing right. Thus, the legislator, as well as the physician faced 
with such a decision, can decide who should be helped and 
who should not. From the general human rights claim to 
respect, it can only be deduced that the selection may not 
be made arbitrarily, but must be made according to fxed 
Triage
292 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
criteria oriented to the matter in hand. Selection on the 
basis of characteristics such as race, religion, gender or 
similar is therefore ruled out. Criteria based on the respon￾sibility of those in need of help, on the other hand, would 
be appropriate. For example, in a triage situation, prefer￾ence for lung transplantation could be given to those 
whose lungs have been damaged by unavoidable environ￾mental factors and to those whose disease is due to exces￾sive smoking. Similarly, in the context of a pandemic, 
situations can be imagined in which it may be justifed to 
give priority to those who have been vaccinated.
Similarly, whether or not the state criminalizes human 
rights violations by third parties, such as abortion, is a 
matter of policy. In a democratic society where most of 
the members have no ethical objections to abortion, crim￾inal protection of the human embryo is politically unen￾forceable. That alone does not make a state an unjust state. 
The only decisive factor is whether it fully complies with 
its duty of respect. This is doubtful, however, when the law 
not only permits, but even requires, the fnancing of abor￾tions by health insurers.
There is a second reason why the duties arising from 
human dignity are limited to duties of respect and do not 
include duties of action. The value of human dignity 
refers to the right of self-determination of every human 
being. Humane living conditions are conditions under 
which people can determine their own lives according to 
goals and means they have set for themselves. Without this 
autonomy, we are always just means and tools used for the 
beneft of others. Obligations to help and protect in every 
case in which an inhumane living situation cannot other￾wise be avoided would presuppose that we must devote 
our own lives entirely to alleviating or avoiding the suffer￾ing of others. A universal absolute obligation to guarantee 
dignifed living conditions would have a paradoxical con￾sequence: helpers would have to sacrifce their dignifed 
lives in order to help others to live in dignity. But the ben￾efciaries of this help would not be allowed to enjoy their 
newly acquired dignifed life either, but would have to sac￾rifce it immediately in order to help those who are still in 
need. Such a morality would be self-contradictory. It fol￾lows from these considerations that the intensity and 
extent of our commitment to the poor and those in need 
of protection is a matter of our own discretion. There is 
not, nor can there be, a rule that determines the extent of 
our commitment. But again, where there is discretion, 
Criminalization of 
Abortion
Self-determination
293
15.6 · Duties to Refrain from Doing Something and Duties...15
there is no duty. Discretion is exactly the opposite of coer￾cion of will.
What applies to the autonomy of individuals also 
applies to the autonomy of states. Because the claim to 
state autonomy derives from the autonomy of its citizens. 
The state’s right to self-determination would come to an 
end if states were obliged to provide effective assistance 
and protection wherever humane living conditions could 
not otherwise be created or maintained.
15.7 “Social Human Rights” As State Goal 
Resolutions
The codifed catalogs of so-called social human rights do 
not guarantee subjective rights to the establishment of 
social institutions to ensure subsistence, education, or 
health. Article 22 UDHR only holds out the prospect of 
such institutions, subject to the resources available to 
states and their internal organization. Article 2 ICESCR 
requires contracting parties to take measures, to the fullest 
of their abilities, to achieve progressively, by all appropri￾ate means, the full realization of the rights set forth in the 
Covenant. Thus, again, measures to establish social insti￾tutions are only envisaged, but no subjective rights to 
these institutions are granted. Moreover, states already 
meet the obligations of the ICESCR when they establish 
social institutions for their citizens, or for those who are 
lawfully present on their territory, but not for all people 
who have a need for them. This is not to be seen as an 
inadequacy or shortcoming of the codifed human rights 
regime. On the contrary, philosophical analysis has shown 
that genuine human rights can only ever be subjective 
rights directed to the refraining of harmful conduct, not 
rights to the granting of benefts.
If these codifcations nevertheless speak of rights, this 
points to defciencies in the international legal language. 
The term “rights” is used because there is no expression 
that could adequately express what is meant. Moreover, 
there is also a connection in meaning to genuine human 
rights. For both these rights and the plan to establish social 
institutions are about enabling people to live under 
humane living conditions. What is actually meant by the 
so-called social human rights is that human dignity as an 
absolute value makes living conditions in which people 
Article 22 UDHR/
Article 2 ICESCR
Poorness of Language
294 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
lack what is necessary for a life in dignity intolerable. Such 
living conditions are not to be accepted. There is a strong 
moral impulse to eliminate them. This urgency is expressed 
very inadequately and misleadingly by the word “rights.”
It would therefore be much clearer if we did not speak 
of social human rights, but of political tasks and goals 
that the contracting states have committed themselves to 
achieving. In German legal terminology, the term “State 
Goal Resolution” (Staatszielbestimmung) proposed by 
Hans Peter Ipsen has become established for this purpose. 
According to this defnition, a state goal resolution is a 
constitutional norm with objective-legal effect that pre￾scribes the ongoing observance or fulfllment of certain 
tasks by state activity. In the Basic Law, we fnd state goal 
provisions in the designation of the Federal Republic as a 
social state (social federal state or social constitutional 
state) in Article 20 Paragraph 1 and Article 28 Paragraph 
1 as well as in the clauses on the protection of the natural 
foundations of life and animal protection in Article 20a. It 
would be possible to adopt this term in the language of 
international law as well, in particular to designate those 
internationally binding tasks and goals for which the mis￾leading expression “social human rights“stands today.
Like national constitutional state goal resolutions, the 
codifed so-called social human rights do not establish 
subjective rights, but only objective law between the con￾tracting states. In contrast to state goal resolutions, which 
are only anchored in national constitutions, those from 
international treaties lead to the authority under interna￾tional law of all contracting states to observe and criticize 
the social, education and health policies of all other con￾tracting states. The contracting states thus subject them￾selves to the compulsion to justify their social, education 
and health policies to the international community. They 
can no longer plead that these policy areas are internal 
affairs.
Considering that there can be neither a subjective right 
to access social institutions if they do not exist, nor a sub￾jective right to the establishment of such institutions, it 
seems surprising that on December 10, 2008, the UN 
General Assembly adopted an Optional Protocol to the 
1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, according to which individuals have the 
right to fle a complaint before the UN Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) against 
their own nation state if they can claim a violation of their 
State Goal Resolutions
ICESCR Optional 
Protocol
295
15.7 · “Social Human Rights” As State Goal Resolutions15
rights under the International Covenant. Such a com￾plaint procedure actually presupposes that there are sub￾jective rights under the ICESCR whose violation can be 
claimed. However, this is not the case. The Protocol has so 
far been signed by 26 states and ratifed by 22 states. In the 
meantime, the CESCR has already developed a consider￾able practice of adjudication and has upheld the com￾plaints in a few cases. How is this possible if there are no 
subjective rights that can be violated?
However, a closer look at the case law shows that 
among the successful complaints there is not a single one 
claiming that a particular state lacks certain social institu￾tions that the state undertook to establish under the 
ICESCR.  Rather, the only successful complaints have 
been those alleging that the complainant has been wrong￾fully denied access to an existing social institution. This 
shows that social human rights can only be effective if the 
social institutions already exist and access to them is pos￾sible. If an individual is then unlawfully denied access by 
not receiving the beneft to which they are entitled under 
the institution’s dedicatory purpose, then their complaint 
before the CESCR has a chance of success. The CESCR 
thus acts as a kind of international administrative tribu￾nal. In this way, the Committee flls a gap in legal protec￾tion in countries that do not have a functioning 
administrative judiciary, or it functions, as it were, as a 
kind of extension of the administrative court system that 
can provide a review of national case law in the last 
instance.
15.8 The Redundancy of Social Human 
Rights
In 2011, the ECtHR issued a decision that shows the 
redundancy of the institutionalized individual complaint 
according to the above-mentioned optional protocol.
The case goes as follows: An asylum seeker entered the 
European Union in Greece and lived there for a while on 
the streets. Greece did not give him the opportunity to 
apply for asylum and did not provide him with any social 
support. Consequently, he traveled to Belgium and applied 
for asylum there. The Belgian authorities deported him 
back to Greece because Greece was, according to the rules 
M.S.S v Belgium and 
Greece
296 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
of the European Union (Dublin Regulation), responsible 
for the decision about the asylum application. The asylum 
seeker fled a complaint against Belgium because the state 
had sent him to a state where his human rights were in 
danger. He also fled a complaint against Greece because 
the country had not protected him. The ECtHR consid￾ered a violation of Article 3 ECHR.  Remember that 
Article 3 ECHR only contains the ban of torture and 
inhuman and degrading treatment—pure liberal human 
rights and no social rights. I quote from the judgment:
» 249. The Court […] considers it necessary to point out 
that Article 3 cannot be interpreted as obliging the High 
Contracting Parties to provide everyone within their 
jurisdiction with a home […]. Nor does Article 3 entail 
any general obligation to give refugees fnancial assis￾tance to enable them to maintain a certain standard of 
living […].
250. The Court is of the opinion, however, that what is at 
issue in the instant case cannot be considered in those 
terms. Unlike in the above-cited Müslimcase […], the 
obligation to provide accommodation and decent mate￾rial conditions to impoverished asylum-seekers has now 
entered into positive law and the Greek authorities are 
bound to comply with their own legislation, which trans￾poses Community law, namely Council Directive 2003/9/
EC laying down minimum standards for the reception of 
asylum-seekers in the member States […]. What the appli￾cant holds against the Greek authorities in this case is 
that, because of their deliberate actions or omissions, it 
has been impossible in practice for him to avail himself of 
these rights and provide for his essential needs. […]
263. In the light of the above and in view of the obliga￾tions […] under the Reception Directive […], the Court 
considers that the Greek authorities […] must be held 
responsible, because of their inaction, for the situation in 
which he has found himself for several months, living on 
the street, with no resources or access to sanitary facili￾ties, and without any means of providing for his essential 
needs. The Court considers that the applicant has been 
the victim of humiliating treatments showing a lack of 
respect for his dignity […]
297
15.8 · The Redundancy of Social Human Rights15
264. It follows that, through the fault of the authorities, 
the applicant has found himself in a situation incompat￾ible with Article 3 of the Convention. Accordingly, there 
has been a violation of that provision.
Here again you can see that social institutions must frst be 
established (accommodation facilities for asylum seekers) 
or at least the state must be obliged to establish them by 
positive law (Council Directive 2003/9/EC). Only then 
does a subjective human right to access come into ques￾tion because the exclusion of someone in need from a 
social institution can be considered an inhuman treatment 
and a violation of classical liberal human rights. In this 
respect, the Court focuses on the prohibition of degrada￾tion in Article 3 ECHR. Our analysis of Article 3 ECHR 
(see 7 Chap. 8) has shown that the differentiation between 
inhuman and degrading treatment as made by the ECtHR 
is not convincing. Degradation and inhumanity are syn￾onyms. Moreover, they characterize any human rights vio￾lation and do not refer to that specifc type of human 
rights violation that Article 3 ECHR is concerned with, 
namely cruelty resulting in violations of physical and men￾tal integrity. The judgment is nonetheless convincing in its 
outcome, because it is cruel to deprive a person of the 
shelter, food and sanitation to which they are entitled, and 
thus actively prevent them from leading a life of dignity.
15.9 The Right to Natural Resources
Recently, the question of the legal protection of the natu￾ral resources of life has come into focus. It is currently 
being discussed more intensively than the question of pro￾tecting the economic and social resources of life.
15.9.1 The Rights to Water
At the international level, the right to water and sanita￾tion, which the UN General Assembly called for in a reso￾lution of July 28, 2010, should be mentioned in this 
context. Just as little as through the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights adopted by the UN General Assembly, 
this is not binding law. This is because the UN General 
Assembly does not have the power to create binding law 
(Article 13 UN Charter). In this respect, it only makes 
GA Resolution 64/292
298 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rights15
recommendations, which can, however, lead to binding 
international law, as in the case of the UDHR fnally hap￾pening through ICCPR and ICESCR. Therefore, it is a 
meaningful philosophical question whether the right to 
water demanded by the UN General Assembly can be 
understood as a genuine moral right, which as such is 
suitable to be transformed into a subjective juridical 
right.
However, this must be denied for the same reasons that 
have already justifed the impossibility of so-called social 
human rights. The resolution is not about access to water 
at all, i.e., not about the consequences of climate-related 
drought. Rather, it is about access to clean water. Many 
people in developing countries do not have access to clean 
water because garbage, feces and agricultural waste end up 
untreated in lakes and rivers. As a result, 1.5 million chil￾dren die each year from contaminated water. The only way 
to remedy this situation is to create sanitary facilities, sew￾age treatment plants and a sewerage infrastructure. An 
enormous fnancial, planning and construction effort is 
therefore required to guarantee the population clean 
drinking water. As in the case of the so-called social 
human rights, it is thus evident that there can be no subjec￾tive right to (clean) water as long as there is a lack of the 
necessary infrastructure and that there can be no right to 
the creation of the same, because this depends on the 
fnancial resources available to the states. The Water 
Resolution therefore also stipulates that states and inter￾national organizations should push for the creation of the 
necessary water infrastructure systems. The resolution 
thus fxes state goals. To the extent that it simultaneously 
asserts a subjective moral or even juridical right to clean 
water, it is mere rhetoric owed to the poorness of interna￾tional legal language.
15.9.2 Right to Compatible Global Climate
The skepticism against subjective human rights to benefts 
advocated in this chapter seems to be refuted by a 2021 
ruling of the BVerfG, in which the court seems to recog￾nize a subjective (fundamental) right to protection from 
the dangers of climate change and to make it the basis of 
its judicature. A closer look, however, shows that the 
impression is deceptive.
Poorness of language
299
15.9 · The Right to Natural Resources15
First, however, the court asserts that the right to physi￾cal integrity guaranteed in Article 2 (2) of the Basic Law 
includes a right to protection against the threat to health 
posed by climate change (paras. 144ff.). However, the high 
expectations raised by this are completely disappointed in 
the further course of the explanations. A right to protec￾tion against the health consequences of climate change 
fails, as the court states, because the German state has no 
power whatsoever to infuence global climate change on its 
own to such an extent that any health risks for individual 
people would be averted. In order to be able to do any￾thing at all against climate change, the German state must 
limit itself to seeking international cooperation and mak￾ing its own fair contribution to combating climate change 
in association with all other states in the world (para. 149). 
Thus, the claim to protection of health shrinks to a claim 
to international cooperation. The court fails to mention 
that there can only be international cooperation if not 
only Germany but also all or at least most of the other 
states participate in it. However, Germany has no infu￾ence on whether and to what extent the other states want 
to cooperate. Thus, the claim to health protection shrinks 
to a claim to foreign policy efforts to cooperate with an 
uncertain outcome. If one also considers that the Basic 
Law does not say exactly which measures must be taken in 
order to be able to establish a suffcient foreign policy 
effort, but that the duty to protect is, as the court itself 
aptly puts it, “fundamentally indeterminate” in this respect 
(para. 152), then it becomes apparent that the bottom line 
is that nothing remains of the right to protection of health 
from the consequences of climate change. The court does 
reserve the right to intervene and fnd a violation of the 
state’s duty to protect if the state either remains com￾pletely inactive or the measures taken are completely inap￾propriate or inadequate (para. 152). The accusation of 
complete inaction, however, can be countered even by the 
climate-conscious Sunday speech of a member of the gov￾ernment. The accusation of complete inadequacy of mea￾sures is, as the outcome of the proceedings shows, so vague 
that no one can think that they have a right to anything in 
this respect.
However, the BVerfG had to decide on a situation that 
was already characterized by international cooperation to 
a large extent. This cooperation had led to the 2016 Paris 
Climate Protection Agreement, which commits signatory 
states to make contributions to keep the increase in the 
300 Chapter 15 · Social Human Rightsaverage temperature of the Earth “well below 2 °C above 
pre-industrial levels” and to make efforts “to limit the tem￾perature increase to 1.5  °C above pre-industrial levels.” 
Parties also committed to increasing their capacity to 
adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
The Bundestag had enacted a climate protection law in 
December 2019 to implement these obligations under 
international law. This stipulated that climate neutrality 
should be achieved by 2050 and that a reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions of 55% compared to 1990 
should be achieved by 2030. The BVerfG does see that, 
based on current research, the target of “well below 2 °C” 
will probably not be suffcient, as tipping points may 
already be reached at a global warming to 1.5 °C, which 
would lead to an uncontrollable increase in CO2
 emissions 
and make any health protection by stopping climate 
change obsolete (para. 161). Nevertheless, it accepts the 
statutory climate targets and refers in this respect to the 
legislature’s broad scope for assessment and to the fact 
that it is not certain whether the fears of science will actu￾ally materialize (para. 162f.). This is remarkable insofar as 
the court explicitly refers to the principle of risk minimiza￾tion at another point in the judgment (para. 194). At this 
point, however, the size of the risk plays no role. This 
shows how unlikely it is that the BVerfG will ever fnd that 
protective measures are completely inadequate. Rather, 
the ruling leaves the impression that certain arguments, 
such as risk minimization, are only used where they do not 
call the legal requirements into question.
However, the court then backs up its readiness to take 
risks shown at this point by pointing out that it is within 
the legislature’s creative freedom to avert threats to health 
in other ways, namely through adaptation measures that 
make people more resistant to the dangers of climate 
change. One thinks here, for example, of higher dikes, 
climate-friendly urban development, and similar mea￾sures. If this argument is to justify exceeding the 1.5 °C 
target, however, it should have led to the success of the 
constitutional complaint of those complainants who are 
resident in Nepal and Bangladesh. This is because, as the 
court rightly points out, it is beyond the scope of the 
German state to implement adaptation measures abroad 
(para. 178). With this reasoning, the BVerfG dismisses the 
constitutional complaints from faraway foreign countries 
instead of stating that precisely because there is no possi￾bility of taking responsibility for urban development in 
301 15
15.9 · The Right to Natural Resources15
Kathmandu or dike construction in Bangladesh, the 
1.5 °C target must take on all the greater signifcance.
The constitutional complaints were only successful to 
the extent that the court found that the emission reduc￾tions envisaged by the Climate Protection Act up to 2030 
would mean that the reduction rate in the subsequent 
period would have to be close to 100% in order to achieve 
the self-imposed target of “well below 2 °C”—the court 
bases this on 1.75  °C.  The court also found that the 
national residual budget for CO2
 in 2031 would be less 
than one gigaton. Based on the scientifcally proven 
assumption that the national CO2
 residual budget in 2020 
was 6.7 gigatons, a residual of less than one gigaton would 
remain of this from 2031, which would be “barely suff￾cient for another year” (paras. 233, 246). Thus, climate 
neutrality would have to be largely achieved by 2031 (para. 
234). Since this is in fact not possible, but according to the 
legislator’s assessment the period up to 2050 is still needed 
for this, the consequence would be that people living 
between 2031 and 2050 would suffer massive losses of 
freedom, because they would no longer be allowed to emit 
CO2
 and climate-neutral substitute technologies would 
not yet be available. The burdens associated with the nec￾essary CO2
 reductions by 2050 would thus be distributed 
very unequally among the people living between now and 
2050. The generation still living today would hardly have 
to accept any restrictions on freedom, while later genera￾tions would have to completely forego a CO2
-based stan￾dard of living.
The court sees this as a violation of the principle of 
proportionality and thus a violation of the general free￾dom of action of this group of persons (Article 2 (1) GG). 
It is certainly debatable whether this is really a case of 
application of the principle of proportionality or whether 
it is not rather a question of the general principle of equal￾ity (Article 3 (1) GG). For it is the principle of equality 
that prohibits the unequal distribution of social burdens. 
Irrespective of this dogmatic question, however, it can be 
stated that the constitutional complaints were at least suc￾cessful insofar as they concerned the distribution of bur￾dens. Beneft claims played no role in this.

rights?
2. There are serious doubts as to whether the guarantee 
of labor can be considered a required condition of a

Right to Asylum in Human Rights Treaties
None of the international human rights treaties con￾tain a human right to asylum. Only the UDHR (Article 
14) mentions the right “to seek and to enjoy” asylum. 
This is meant as the right to apply for protection, but 
not as a right to be protected.
Principle of Territorial Sovereignty
The principle of territorial sovereignty says that states 
are, in principle, entitled to close their borders and to 
determine whether and under which conditions a per￾son who is not a citizen of the state in question (alien) 
may enter the country, may reside there, and may chose 
the place of residence.
Right to Global Free Movement
A required condition for a rational discussion about 
whether there is a moral human right to asylum is the 
absence of a universal right to global free movement.
Until recently, the validity of the principle of terri￾torial sovereignty was not within dispute. In the 1980s, 
a philosophical debate begun about a right to global 
free movement (No Border Approach). Defenders of 
this approach argue by referring to an alleged human 
right to global free movement, to the theory of the pre￾sumption of equality, and to the Common Property 
Argument.
306 Chapter 16 · Right to Asylum16
Protection Scope of a Possible Human Right to 
Asylum
In contrast to current positive asylum law, the protec￾tion scope of a possible moral human right to asylum 
only refers to the protection of people who are seri￾ously threatened by a severe violation of human rights 
or by inhuman living conditions in their country of ori￾gin. Mere discrimination is not enough. Importantly, 
the protection scope does not depend on particular 
grounds of persecution (e.g., racism, religion, sexual 
orientation, political opinion, etc.) or the fact of a 
deliberate human activity (persecution).
Refoulement Ban
If refugees are already in the state in question, deporta￾tion or extradition (refoulement) to a country where 
they can expect a severe deprivation of humane living 
conditions is to be considered a violation of human 
rights perpetrated by the deporting state. For example, 
if the refugee can expect torture, then the deportation is 
a violation of the torture ban; if the refugee can expect 
murder, then the deportation is a violation of the right 
to life, etc.
The refoulement ban is an integral part to all classi￾cal human rights. Therefore, there is no place and no 
need for a special human right to asylum.
The Duty to Rescue
If refugees are still outside of the state in question, it is 
not possible for a state to violate their human rights by 
doing something (e.g., deportation). The question is 
only whether the respective state is required to support 
refugees outside of its borders by rescuing them. Help￾ing others who are in need of support is not a duty but 
depends on a discretionary decision of the helper. 
Therefore, there is no right to be rescued.
307
Right to Asylum16
16.1 The Right to Asylum in International 
Law
When we are dealing with the question whether there is a 
human right to asylum, it is frst useful to recognize that 
the catalogue of codifed human rights does not contain 
such a right. Neither the two Human Rights Covenants of 
1966 nor the later UN human rights treaties nor the 
European or American Conventions of Human Right 
contain such a right. The African Human Rights 
Convention (Banjul Charter of 27 June 1981) rules that 
the right to asylum stands under the reservation of the 
national law (see . Fig. 16.1). Considering that the right 
to asylum is made dependent on the positive laws of the 
host countries, we cannot identify a human right to asy￾lum in the African Charter either.
The formulation of the asylum clause in the Banjul 
Charter, however, is interesting insofar as it is very similar 
to the wording of the asylum clause in Article 14 UDHR 
(see . Fig. 16.2). But there is a crucial difference. While 
the Banjul Charter refers to a right to seek and to obtain 
asylum, the UDHR refers only to the right to seek and to 
enjoy asylum. One could think that this difference in word￾ing does not mean a difference in meaning.
This guess seems to be confrmed by the wording of 
Article 16a (1) GG, according to which refugees enjoy the 
right to asylum (see . Fig. 16.3). According to German 
Human Rights 
Covenants 1966
Banjul Charter
Article 14 UDHR
. Fig. 16.2 Article 14 (1) UDHR
Every individual has the right, when persecuted,to
seek and obtain asylum in other countries in accordance
with the laws of those countries and international
conventions.

. Fig. 16.4 Article 13 (1) UDHR
. Fig. 16.3 Article 16 (1) GG
Article 13 UDHR
case law and doctrine, there is no doubt that “to enjoy” 
has the meaning of having a right to asylum. But the 
meaning of to enjoy in Article 14 UDHR is different. The 
expression “to enjoy” is the result of very intensive discus￾sions among the drafters of the UDHR. A former draft 
proposed the wording: “Everyone shall have the right to 
seek and to be granted asylum from persecution.” In 
particular, under the infuence of the large number of ref￾ugees after the Arab-Israeli war in 1948 and with strong 
support from the Arab states, the British proposal was 
adopted, replacing “to be granted” with “to enjoy.” The 
British proposal for the UDHR pursued the aim of avoid￾ing recognizing an obligation of the states to grant asylum 
to those who are persecuted. The granting of asylum 
should be considered a matter of discretion of the state. 
Only if the state has granted asylum can the asylum seeker 
then enjoy asylum. Here, “to enjoy” means to have oppor￾tunity to use a granted status, but not necessarily to have a 
right to receive that status.
In the context of asylum, we must also take notice of 
Article 13 UDHR, which provides that there is a right to 
freedom of movement within the borders of each state (see 
. Fig.  16.4). The wording is obviously vague. What is 
meant by “within the borders of each state”? It seems that 
this wording refers to more than just the territory of the 
state whose nationality someone has or in which someone 
is living. Thus, everyone regardless of their nationality 
should have the right to move in and to reside in each state. 
So, a possible reading of Article 13 (1) UDHR suggests 
that a right to global free movement is recognized. This 
understanding of Article 13 (1) UDHR, however, is not in 
accordance with Article 14 (1) UDHR. If there is a right 
to global free movement, then a right to asylum and even 
a right to seek and enjoy asylum is simply superfuous. If

changed the wording of the right to free movement and 
deleted the vagueness. According to Article 12 (1) ICCPR, 
there is no right to global free movement but only a right 
to movement inside the borders of a state and only for 
those who are lawfully within the territory of that state 
(. Fig. 16.5).
Within the framework of the negotiations on the 
ICCPR, the negotiating states had agreed to make the 
right to asylum a matter of a separate convention. In 1977, 
a conference was held in Geneva, at which a Convention 
on the Right to Asylum was to be agreed upon. 
Nevertheless, the draft did not provide for a substantive 
right to asylum, but only confrmed the previously recog￾nized rules of international law according to which states 
are entitled to grant asylum. The attempt by Germany to 
codify a substantive right to asylum was rejected by the 
great majority of the states. The conference fnally failed 
because the Eastern Bloc states did not want to take on a 
state commitment to provide asylum.
There is, however, an international law of asylum. But 
it is established outside of the human rights discourse and 
outside the framework of human rights conventions. The 
frst Convention on Asylum was agreed to in 1951  in 
Geneva. This is the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees, shorty named Geneva Refugee Convention 
(GRC). The Convention defnes the notion of a refugee 
and describes the minimum status that a refugee should 
enjoy. But the Convention does not contain a substantive 
right of the refugee to get asylum.
Only at the national level are there some state constitu￾tions that contain a substantive right to asylum. The most 
prominent example is Article 16a GG.  The French and 
Italian constitutions also contain a substantive right to 
asylum. In contrast to the German case law and doctrine, 
in France and Italy the substantive right to asylum was 
310 Chapter 16 · Right to Asylum16
not recognized when their respective constitutions came 
into force. It was only later “discovered” by case law.
So, the question arises, whether the absence of a right 
to asylum in the framework of human rights should be 
considered as a defciency that must be eliminated. This is 
the case if there is a moral human right to asylum. This is 
what we must clarify in the following section.
16.2 Is There a Moral Human Right to Global 
Free Movement?
First, we must answer whether there is a human right to 
global free movement. If such a right exists, states would 
not have the right to refuse entry of aliens who want to 
enter their country and reside there. One could then con￾sider whether refusing entry in particular cases is legiti￾mate, for example only where aliens want to enter with a 
criminal or hostile intention or if they represent a serious 
danger to the domestic population. In other words, in the 
case of a right to global free movement, the alien does not 
bear the burden of justifying their entry, but the state must 
bear the burden of justifying the exclusion of the alien. 
Nevertheless, if we accept the right to rejection in certain 
particular cases, the right to global free movement cannot 
be considered as a moral human right because moral 
human rights do not permit any restriction. They are 
absolute rights or they are not human rights. But I want to 
propose setting aside this aspect and focusing instead on 
whether there could be a human right to global free move￾ment in principle.
Previously, the territorial sovereignty of the states has 
not been seen as a philosophical question. In particular 
Immanuel Kant, who frst refected the relationship 
between states and individuals, did not discuss the ques￾tion of the legitimacy of state borders and territorial sov￾ereignty. He argued only for a right to visit. Foreigners 
should have the right to stay as guests for a short period of 
time in a country whose nationality they do not possess. 
But the idea of a right to permanent residence for foreign￾ers was completely remote to him.
Only recently has the legitimacy of territorial sover￾eignty appeared on the philosophical agenda. So far as I 
see, the Canadian philosopher Joseph H.  Carens (1945) 
was the frst who argued for a universal right to global free

16.2 · Is There a Moral Human Right to Global Free Movement?16
movement. Meanwhile, there are many philosophers who 
argue in favor of open borders. They do not only refer to 
an alleged human right to global free movement, but also 
to other approaches. There are three different arguments 
which Open Border theorists rely on:
No Border Postulate
5 The right to free global movement as a human right
5 The Egalitarian Approach (theory of the presumption 
of equality)
5 The Common Property Argument
I am neither convinced of the assertion that there is a 
human right to global free movement, nor am I convinced 
of the Presumption of Equality Approach or of the 
Common Property Argument.
Global free movement is obviously not a matter of 
human rights. Here, I can point to what I said in the ninth 
chapter. It cannot be shown that moving from one place 
on earth to another place on earth or from one society to 
another society is a required condition for the development 
or maintenance of personhood. Immanuel Kant never left 
his birthplace of Königsberg in Eastern Prussia. But I 
think one can hardly assume that Kant lived under inhu￾man conditions and was not able to develop and maintain 
personhood.
The Presumption of Equality Approach teaches that 
human beings must always be treated equally as long as 
there are no reasons to treat them unequally. Considering 
that there are no rational grounds for arguing that some 
people may not enter a certain part of the Earth’s surface 
while others are allowed to do so, every human being must 
have the equal right to enter onto every part of the globe 
and every country. This argument can be criticized under 
two aspects. First, it can be contested that there really is a 
case of unequal treatment here. That foreign nationals do 
not have the right to enter the territory of another state 
without permission is a rule that is applicable for all 
human beings in the same way. Every human being has 
only the right to enter the borders of a state of which they 
are a national. All human beings enjoy the same privileges 
in their capacity as nationals; and the same restrictions in 
their capacity as foreigners.
The other aspect relates to the basic idea of the pre￾sumption of equality. Why should all human beings world￾wide be treated equally?—Bernd Ladwig, who tries to 
Right to Global Free 
Movement
Presumption of 
Equality
312 Chapter 16 · Right to Asylum16
justify a universal right to global free movement this way, 
argues that they are to be treated equally because they 
share the same moral value. From this same moral value 
of all human beings follows, according to Ladwig, that 
everyone’s life, well-being and self-determination are mor￾ally equally important, so that the unequal distribution of 
life chances must be justifed in relation to each affected 
person. If such a justifcation is not possible, then only 
equal distribution remains. But what justifes the claim 
that all human beings have the same moral value? 
Egalitarianism denies that there are absolute rights or 
absolute values. For egalitarians, all conceivable protected 
goods of human rights are initially only objects of subjec￾tive interests and desires from which no moral problems 
arise. Only when it turns out that subjective wishes are 
unequally fulflled does egalitarianism face a moral prob￾lem that must be solved according to the principles of dis￾tributive justice.
But if there are no absolute rights or values, then 
respect for the moral value of the person cannot be based 
on such a right or value. However, it is also not possible to 
derive the moral value of human beings from the principle 
of equality because the applicability of that very principle 
already requires the existence of the moral value of human 
beings. Egalitarians do not deliver arguments in favor of 
the assumption that human beings have a moral value at 
all. The moral value of human beings is expressed in the 
principle of human dignity and in human rights. If global 
free movement, as shown above, cannot be considered a 
matter of human rights, then it cannot be the starting 
point for a claim to equal treatment.
The Common Property Approach argues that the 
planet Earth is not the property of a particular society, but 
rather that it is the common property of the entirety of 
mankind. Therefore, there is no reason to prevent some 
people from entering a certain area on the surface of 
Earth. This argument is also not convincing. Nevertheless, 
explaining as much is not yet possible because we have yet 
to deal with the right to property, which I plan to do in the 
17th chapter. So, my argument in the current context is a 
provisory one. In the 17th chapter, we will see that property
is only the name of a certain bundle of positive rights and 
duties. It is a legal concept, and its content is always a mat￾ter of legislation. Property, therefore, is only possible in 
the framework of a legal system and not beyond such a 
system. The legal system of a state refers only to property

inside that state and tells us nothing about the question of 
property in the Earth. Property on an international level is 
a matter of international positive law, but not a matter of 
a universal moral human rights regime.
16.3 Is There a Moral Human Right 
to Asylum?
Only when we agree, or assume for the purposes of philo￾sophical analysis, that there is no right to global free move￾ment and that states are in principle entitled to close their 
borders and determine whether and under which condi￾tions a foreigner may enter the country, does the question 
arise whether the territorial sovereignty of the state is lim￾ited by a human right on asylum. But another question 
arises frst: when does it get to the point of asylum? It is 
important to understand that current positive asylum law 
does not provide a clear answer to this question.
As you may know, current asylum law of the European 
Union provides two different statuses for those who are in 
need of protection, namely the refugee status according to the 
Convention relating the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the 
subsidiary protection status according to the EU Asylum 
Directive. Refugee Status is the more preferable of the two 
statuses because subsidiary protection status comparatively 
embraces less rights. The existence of these two statuses shows 
that current asylum law does not have a clear moral under￾standing of the conditions under which aliens should be pro￾tected. I want to demonstrate this using the following example.
An alien who fed to an EU member state because they 
were threatened with torture in their country of origin can 
either receive refugee status or subsidiary protection sta￾tus. Such depends on whether the alien is to be tortured in 
their country of origin because the persecutors are moti￾vated by hostility towards certain religions, nationalities, 
political opinions, etc., or because of other rather nonpo￾litical reasons. In the former case, the alien is granted refu￾gee status; in the latter case, the alien is only granted 
subsidiary protection status. The privileged refugee status 
depends on a specifc political situation while the lower 
subsidiary protection status is granted only in order to 
protect the person against a violation of human rights. So, 
the protection of human rights seems to be of a lower 
importance than resistance against certain political strate￾gies in the country of origin.
EU Asylum Law
314 Chapter 16 · Right to Asylum16
If we deliberate over whether there is a human right to 
asylum, it seems obvious to me that the entire existing sys￾tem of current positive asylum law cannot be philosophi￾cally grounded. A human right to asylum only comes into 
consideration if human beings who are not citizens of the 
state in question seek shelter and protection against seri￾ous threats related to severe violations of human rights 
and if they cannot help themselves. The motivation of the 
persecutors does not matter.
Furthermore, I cannot see that persecution as such, i.e., 
targeted aggressive behavior of humans against other 
humans, should be considered relevant. It is only a matter 
of whether a person is actually threatened with a depriva￾tion of goods that are protected by human rights, and not 
whether this violation is caused by the targeted and 
deliberate treatment of the persecutors. Even situations 
where persons are injured without being a target of delib￾erative persecution are to be considered relevant. For exam￾ple, in circumstances where civilians fnd themselves caught 
in armed confict—they are not targets of the fghting par￾ties, but they may nevertheless be the ones who are killed 
and injured by them. Furthermore, it seems to not be rele￾vant to me whether the deprivation of human living condi￾tions is caused by a violation of human rights at all. Even in 
cases where the need for protection is caused by a natural 
disaster or by a lack of appropriate social infrastructure like 
a health system in the country of origin, the question arises 
whether there is a serious need for protection.
Nevertheless, from the fact that aliens are in a situation 
where they are in a serious need for protection does not 
logically follow a duty to render aid and to give any sup￾port. The pure fact that people fee from inhuman condi￾tions of life does not establish a duty to render aid. We 
need additional arguments in order to show whether and 
when such duties arise. This is the core of the question for 
a human right to asylum.
The answer depends on whether the refugees are already 
staying in the potential host country or whether they are 
staying outside the borders of the respective state. So, we 
have to distinguish between two different situations:
1. The situation of asylum seekers who have already 
entered the country legally or illegally.
2. The situation of those who are either in the country of 
origin or outside the home-country but not inside the 
state in question
Human Rights 
Approach
315
16.3 · Is There a Moral Human Right to Asylum?16
16.4 Right to Asylum for Asylum Seekers 
Inside the State Borders
Let us frst look at the situation of those asylum seekers 
that are already within the country of protection or that 
have reached the border of that country. Is there a human 
obligation to grant them asylum that corresponds with the 
asylum seekers’ human right to asylum?
In order to fnd an answer to this question, it is useful 
to ask what would happen if there were no such duty. In 
doing so, we assume that the person seeking protection 
entered the country of protection without permission and 
that the asylum seeker does not enjoy the right to stay on 
another legal basis. We also assume that they cannot enjoy 
protection and security in any other third country. In this 
case, we would have to conclude that the foreigner is within 
the host country illegally and is therefore required to leave 
the country. If they do not voluntarily comply with this 
obligation, they will be deported to the state of their 
nationality. This is the state from which they escaped 
because they were threatened with serious damage to one 
or more essential goods which are protected by human 
rights.
The moral question here is whether the state is morally 
obliged to refrain from doing something, namely deport￾ing the individual back to the country of origin. We may 
recall from the last chapter that omissions can be a matter 
of strict and absolute duties, which can be related to abso￾lute rights. It follows that a subjective right to asylum is 
only conceivable if there is a corresponding duty to refrain 
from doing something, namely, to refrain from deporting 
the asylum seeker. The question is now the following: 
What is the moral basis for a duty to refrain from deport￾ing an asylum seeker?
Deportation as such consists only in the organizing of 
travel from country A to country B. In terms of human 
rights, deportation is therefore morally indifferent. But in 
the case of an asylum seeker, the question arises whether 
we must take into account the consequences of the depor￾tation or whether it is suffcient to take only the isolated 
act of deportation into account. Let us take the case that 
the alien, when deported to the country of origin, is 
exposed to maltreatment within the meaning of Article 3 
ECHR.  According to the ECHR, contracting states are 
not allowed to maltreat persons. But the deporting state is 
Correspondence of 
Duties and Rights
316 Chapter 16 · Right to Asylum16
not the entity which is maltreating the person in question. 
Its action consists only in the act of deportation, not in the 
act of maltreating. The expected maltreatment will be 
done by agents in the country of origin, for whose behav￾ior the deporting state is not responsible because it has no 
control over them.
Nevertheless, it can be shown that the deporting state is 
morally responsible for maltreatment that occurs in the 
target state of the deportation. The moral concept of 
responsibility is refected in the legal concept of responsi￾bility. Although the legal concept of responsibility is 
constructed somewhat differently in criminal law than in 
civil law, both the criminal and civil law construction 
clearly lead to a legal responsibility and thus also to a 
moral responsibility.
According to the prevailing opinion in German penal 
law, an agent is responsible for a certain result if the result 
is caused by the action, i.e., if the action is to be consid￾ered the conditio sine qua non of the result and if the agent 
acted either intentionally or negligently. An agent acts 
intentionally where the result of their actions is known 
and desired by the agent. The result is desired not only if it 
is the specifc objective of the action, but also if the agent 
acts deliberately without any regard for the consequences 
of their actions. Negligence is a failure to exercise reason￾able care when acting, by considering the potential harm 
that the action might foreseeably cause to other people.
Without any doubt, the deportation is the conditio sine 
qua non of the maltreatment because without the deporta￾tion, the maltreatment could not happen. The deporting 
state can be accused of acting intentionally when it expects 
that the maltreatment will occur despite not wishing it. 
Similarly, even if the deporting state does not expect the 
maltreatment, it is responsible if it acts negligently by 
ignoring the foreseeability of the maltreatment. So, if 
there is suffcient knowledge available that the alien will be 
exposed to maltreatment when deported to their country 
of origin, the deporting state is responsible for the mal￾treatment. Therefore, the deporting state commits an act 
of maltreatment through the deportation.
We fnd the same result if we apply the concept of 
responsibility as provided in civil law, particularly the law 
of tort. The difference here is that the concept of causality 
is understood differently. An action is not to be considered 
as a cause of a certain result if, according to the experience 
of life, it is rather unlikely that the result will happen. In 
Theory of Action
317
16.4 · Right to Asylum for Asylum Seekers Inside the State Borders16
our case however, the maltreatment is very likely and 
therefore the responsibility of the deporting state for the 
maltreatment cannot be denied.
Saying that the deporting state is responsible for the 
maltreatment is saying that the deporting state itself com￾mits the maltreatment. The act of deportation as such is
an act of maltreatment. The maltreatment, therefore, is a 
severe violation of basic human rights (Article 3 ECHR).
16.5 The Refoulement Ban in Positive 
Asylum Law
The result of our analysis partly confrms the legal provi￾sions as well as the legal doctrine of non-refoulement 
under which persons who are threatened with a violation 
of basic human rights in their home-country may not be 
deported to that country. A closer look to the codifca￾tions in question, however, shows that these provisions can 
be criticized by means of philosophical analysis.
The non-refoulement provision of Article 33 (1) GRC 
contains some reservations of the ban (see . Fig. 16.6). It 
only applies to those who are threatened by persecution 
and not to those who are threatened by inhuman living 
conditions. Furthermore, it applies only to those who are 
persecuted on account of particular persecution grounds. 
The restriction of the protection by these persecution 
grounds cannot be justifed as we have seen above. 
Furthermore, paragraph two shows that the refoulement 
ban cannot be applied to those who committed a severe 
. Fig. 16.6 Article 33 Geneva Refugee Convention
Refugee Convention
318 Chapter 16 · Right to Asylum16
. Fig. 16.7 Article 3 (1) CAT
Convention Against 
Torture
crime despite the fact that even criminals are bearers of 
human rights and may not have such rights violated.
The non-refoulement rule in the Convention against 
Torture of 1984 (CAT) can also be criticized by means of 
philosophy. Article 3 contains a clear and unconditioned 
refoulement ban in the case of threatening torture (cruel 
treatment for specifc purposes), but not in the case of 
threatening cruel treatment without specifc purposes, 
although such maltreatment, like torture, is a severe viola￾tion of basic human rights (see . Fig. 16.7).
The philosophical requirements concerning the 
refoulement ban are best met by the case law of the 
ECtHR. Beginning with its judgement of 1989 in the case 
Soering v. UK, the Court decided that the refoulement ban 
is an inherent element of the human rights of the 
ECHR. Unfortunately, the Court did not make suffciently 
clear that this doctrine is applicable to all human rights of 
the ECHR. This is why it is a widely held opinion that the 
refoulement ban is only an integral part of Article 3 
ECHR.  But this conclusion is not convincing. The case 
law of the ECtHR is only convincing if it is based on the 
major premise that the refoulement ban is integral part of 
all the human rights of the Convention. From this premise 
follows that it is also part of Article 3. The refoulement 
ban must be considered an integral part of each human 
right. Accepting the duties that follow from these rights 
means accepting the refoulement ban.
From the result of our considerations follows an 
important consequence. Considering that the refoule￾ment ban is an integral part of each human right, there is 
no need and no space for a specifc human right to asy￾lum. The talk about a human right to asylum, when it 
refers to asylum seekers who are already inside the coun￾try of possible protection, is redundant talk. So, the 
result of our analysis so far is that there is no specifc 
human right to asylum, but that asylum seekers inside 
the country of possible protection are suffciently pro￾319
16.5 · The Refoulement Ban in Positive Asylum Law16
tected by the framework of all classical human rights. 
This is the case because the refoulement ban is an inte￾gral element of every human right.
16.6 Right to Asylum for Asylum Seekers 
Outside the State Borders
Now we come to the case of refugees who have not yet 
reached the territory of the state of possible protection 
and are still in the country where they are in danger or 
where they are already outside the country of origin some￾where in the desert or on the high seas. In both cases, we 
assume that support cannot be delivered by other states 
because other states are either not able or not willing to 
render aid at the place where people in need are staying. 
Now we ask whether the refugees have a human right to 
asylum that can be exercised toward the state of potential 
protection.
In this case, the question is not whether there is a duty 
to refrain from doing something. Rather, the appropriate 
question is whether there is a duty to do something—to 
rescue the refugees, to take them under protection, and to 
bring them into a territory where they are safe. Similarly, 
in the absence of other possibilities, the question is whether 
they are to be brought to the territory of the state in ques￾tion.
As we saw in 7 Chap. 15, the moral qualifcation of 
doing good is different from the moral qualifcation of 
refraining from doing evil. Human rights can exist only 
regarding obligations to omit. Here, however, it is not an 
omission but a doing that is required. And its extent is 
always at the discretion of the one who is called upon to 
act. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is a strict duty 
to rescue and protect and a corresponding right to be res￾cued and protected. Thus, there is no moral human right 
to asylum in such cases.
If at all, there can only be a right that refers to the duty 
to responsible decision making and to a fair process of 
balancing. A fair balancing process must take into account 
the severity of the need on the one hand and the state’s 
resources on the other. As a rule, it may therefore be pos￾sible to demand more from rich states than from poorer 
states. However, concrete people who are in need some￾Action and Omission
320 Chapter 16 · Right to Asylum16
where in the world and require assistance have no right to 
a proper and fair consideration. For that would presup￾pose that these people have a claim against a concrete state 
to deal with the issue. However, as long as there are a large 
number of states that could provide assistance, no indi￾vidual state has to justify its considerations to specifc 
people in need of protection.
A fnal remark should be made. The moral status of a 
person seeking protection vis-à-vis a particular state does 
not depend on whether or not they have already crossed its 
border. Rather, it depends on whether the refugee is in a 
situation where the state in question already exercises 
effective power and control. Therefore, a state violates its 
duty to refrain from harm if it does not shelter refugees 
who are on board a ship fying its fag or even let them be 
taken to a country where they are at risk of human rights 
violations.

The Meaning of Property
Property is the collective name for the bundle of rights 
(and duties) that the owner of the property holds with 
respect to material things (mobile or immobile) or ideas 
(intellectual property). In a wider sense, it is possible to 
hold property also in entitlements. The bundle of rights 
that constitute property can be defned differently.
Philosophical Foundations of the Right to Property
Occupation Theory (Plato): Property is constituted by 
occupation and the factual respect of that act by fellow 
humans. This argument suffers from a naturalistic fal￾lacy.
Labor Theory (Locke): There is a natural right to 
property in one’s own body. Thus, a person is also 
owner of the actions committed by their body. Further￾more, a person is also owner of the objects that are 
made by their own actions. This argument suffers (1) 
from a specifc pitfall of the English language that uses 
the same expression (property) for attribute as well as 
for belonging and tends to confuse the different mean￾ings of these two concepts. It further suffers from a 
quaternio terminorum because it confuses two different 
meanings of the pronoun “my.” It is important to dis￾tinguish “my” as an identity pronoun from “my” as a 
possessive pronoun.
Positivistic Status Theory (Hume): Property refers 
to a legal status. A status is a bundle of rights and 
duties. The bundle is defned by positive law. So, it is up 
to the legislator to introduce or to abolish property in 
certain entities and to establish rules concerning the 
distribution of property. Example for the abolishment 
of property: The Nuclear Power Exit judgment of the 
Federal Constitutional Court.
Considering that there is no need for property rights 
in order to protect personhood, property rights cannot 
be considered human rights. There is a need for a sub￾sistence minimum, but not for property.

Collective Human Rights
According to Karel Vašák, there are three generations 
of human rights. The frst generation embraces the clas￾sical or the so-called liberal human rights. The second 
generation embraces the social human rights. The third 
generation embraces the human rights of collectives
(tribes, language-minorities, etc.)
Collective rights are rights held by a group, but not 
by the particular members of a group.
Collectives as such are not endowed with reason 
and conscience. They are not persons in a natural sense. 
Therefore, collective rights cannot be considered 
human rights.
The alleged equal status of human rights and col￾lective rights can lead to conficts which can only be 
resolved by a relativization of human rights. This is 
contrary to the absolute character of human rights. 
The function of human rights is to protect the individ￾ual from its total absorption by collectives.
As I mentioned several times before, the codifcations of 
human rights contain not only rights that can be consid￾ered as human rights because they can be derived from the 
principle of human dignity. The codifcations also contain 
some rights that cannot be considered human rights. Some 
of them are purely ideologically based. The desire to label 
them as human rights serves only for the purpose of per￾suading people to accept them despite the fact that any 
justifcation for them is built on sand. In the 15th chapter, 
I mentioned the so-called human right to labor. Habeas 
corpus rights (see 7 Chap. 9) are different. Behind them is 
a genuine requirement of justice. Nevertheless, they are 
not human rights, because they are only procedural rights. 
They are intended to protect freedom of action, but not 
personhood, i.e., freedom of will.
In this chapter, I want to deal with two more examples. 
The frst one deserves particular attention because it 
belongs to the classical stock of almost every human rights 
codifcation since the beginning of the history of codifca￾tion. It also belongs to the stock of those alleged human 
rights which have been a focus of philosophical delibera￾tion since the beginning of philosophical deliberation 
about human rights. This is the right to property. The 
325
Fake Human Rights17
other example refers to a relatively new development in 
the history of human rights. This is the right to what we 
can call collective identity.
17.1 The Right to Property
The right to property is mentioned in the Virginia Bill of 
Rights of 1776 as well as in the French Declaration of 
the Right of Man and Citizen of 1789. It is also men￾tioned in the UDHR of 1948 (see . Fig.  17.1). But 
Article 17 (2) UDHR offers the idea that a person can be 
deprived of property under certain circumstances. The 
clause, however, does not set out the circumstances under 
which such deprivation can occur. It only indicates that 
the deprivation may not be arbitrary. So, this clause can 
be applied on the basis of any reason so long as the 
method is not arbitrary. This leads to uncertainty as to 
whether the drafters of the UDHR intended the right to 
property to be a human right. Still more interesting is the 
fact that neither the ICCPR nor the ICESCR mention 
the right to property.
The ECHR of 1950 did not mention the right to prop￾erty either. Nevertheless, it was introduced in the frst 
Additional Protocol of 1952 (see . Fig. 17.2). When the 
Convention was being drafted, it was generally agreed 
among the negotiating parties that a right to property 
should be inserted into the text of the convention.

Nevertheless, they failed to reach an agreement on the 
details of the formulation. Therefore, this right was added 
afterwards. It is important to note that this right stands 
under the reservation of public interest. This is obviously 
the opposite of a human right. A human right under the 
reservation of public interest is simply a contradiction in 
itself. So, we must ask whether the codifed wording of the 
right to property fails because it does not take into account 
the specifc character of a human right, or whether the 
codifcation is at all appropriate because the right to prop￾erty is not really a human right. Before we can clarify the 
specifc character of the right to property, regardless of 
whether we consider it a human right, we must frst ask 
what property actually is.
17.1.1 The Concept of Property
In contrast to notions like life, ideas, bodily or mental 
integrity, associations, and assemblies, the term property
does not refer to something that exists in the real world 
and that can be made a subject of moral or juridical pro￾tection. Property does not refer to an extra-juridical real￾ity, but rather only to the world of law. It is a judicial 
concept. It denotes a bundle of rights and duties that, for 
their part, relate primarily to objects of the material world 
or to ideas (intellectual property). According to a still 
wider framed concept of property, the bundle of rights 
and duties cannot only refer to things in the material 
world, but also to certain legal positions. According to 
German law, for instance, objects of property include 
future pension beneft entitlements that employees have 
earned in return for their services or in return for the regu￾lar payment of insurance premiums.
Regarding the content of the property rights, we can at 
least distinguish among the following:
5 the right to exclusive possession,
5 the right to exclusive use,
5 the right to exclusive disposal (about who may use it),
5 the right to exclusive enjoyment of the fruits,
5 the right to consumption and destruction,
5 the right to modifcation,
5 the right to transfer the property to others,
5 the right to bequeathing property,
5 the right to inherit the property of someone who 
passed away,

Property
327
17.1 · The Right to Property17
5 the right to protection against expropriation without 
compensation, and
5 the right to acquire ownerless goods by taking posses￾sion of them.
This is only a catalogue of typical property rights. Which 
of them and to what extent they are really part of the 
property order of a certain country depends on the respec￾tive positive law.
Regarding the content of the duties of property, there 
is a wide range of different rules in the different property 
orders of different states as well:
5 Sometimes there are no duties connected with prop￾erty. The owner can do with their items of property 
whatever they want to.
5 Sometimes there are specifc duties for owners of 
property, e.g., the duty to pay a specifc tax as a land 
owner.
5 In some cases, there are general rules on the obliga￾tions of owners, e.g., the prohibition of vacant dwell￾ings (the obligation of owners of dwellings to either 
use them as dwellings themselves or to rent them to 
others for residential purposes).
Regarding the subjects to whom property can be assigned, 
there is also a wide range of different rules. Sometimes 
every natural person is entitled to hold property. Sometimes 
only a certain group of individuals are entitled to hold 
property (landlords, nobility, only adults, only males). 
Sometimes associations and organizations can hold prop￾erty, sometimes not. Sometimes only the state or public 
authorities are entitled to hold property in certain things 
(e.g., property in war weapons).
The wide range of different property orders might 
suggest that we are dealing with an item governed 
solely by positive law. Nevertheless, it could also be the 
case that there is a hard core of property rights that is 
anchored in the morality of human rights. In order to 
find that out, we can ask whether there are profound 
philosophical argumentations in favor of the idea that 
property rights are embedded in a conception of human 
rights.
328 Chapter 17 · Fake Human Rights17
17.1.2 Philosophical Conceptions 
of Property
The most traditional philosophical theory of property is 
called the occupation theory. It was initially advocated by 
Plato and remained the sole or at least most prevailing 
theory until John Locke. According to this theory, prop￾erty is based on occupation and the power to defend it 
against those who do not want to accept that. This idea 
underlies the story of the foundation of Rome by Romulus. 
He drew a line around a feld and declared to his brother 
Remus that this was the district of the new founded city of 
Rome and that everybody who crossed the line without 
permission would be killed. Remus jumped over the line 
and he was immediately killed by his brother Romulus. 
The Romans shared the opinion that this story can be con￾sidered a suffcient ground for the legitimacy of their 
property in the city of Rome.
Nevertheless, the occupation theory of property suf￾fers from severe logical mistake. It is based on what we call 
a violation of Hume’s law or a naturalistic fallacy. As you 
already know, naturalistic fallacy consists of the deriving 
a norm from a fact or moving from be to ought (see 
7 Chap. 2). You may remember that David Hume and 
Immanuel Kant have shown that such a conclusion is logi￾cally invalid. In the case of the occupation theory of prop￾erty, such a false conclusion takes place. The act of 
occupation as well as the fact of the power to defend it 
does not lead to a right that describes why someone is enti￾tled to exclusive use of the items while others are not.
The most sophisticated reasoning in favor of the idea 
that the right to property should be regarded as a human 
right stems from John Locke. It is called the labor theory 
of property. In his Second Treatise of Government, he 
developed the following argumentation.
Every human person has an exclusive right to themself. 
They are therefore the owner of their body as well as of 
their consciousness or abilities. They are, in particular, the 
owner of their own free will and therefore the owner of all 
actions and omissions that are based on their own free 
will. According to Locke, from this follows that the person 
is also the “owner of their labor,” because labor is a kind 
of action that is based on a person’s free will and is there￾fore to be considered their labor. Considering that they are 
the owner of their labor, they are also the owner of the 
Plato
Lohn Locke
329
17.1 · The Right to Property17
results of their labor. I will call these results artifacts. So 
my body, my actions, and my work result in my artifacts. 
Whatever a person takes out from nature and mixes up 
with their work becomes their property. Property is there￾fore a relationship between the person and the items that 
they created, including the raw material from which the 
items are created. Artifacts that they have made or created 
are part of their person. In other words, property is a rela￾tionship between an item and a person. Property makes 
any item to a contingent attribute of a person.
Locke’s theory of property is an excellent example for 
the fact that our kind of thinking is strongly infuenced by 
our kind of talking. If our language is not appropriate, 
then there is a huge risk to develop false ideas. This 
becomes very clear in this case because Locke’s theory is 
obviously the result of two pitfalls of language.
The frst pitfall is specifc for the English language. I 
think this is a suffcient explanation for the fact that 
Locke’s idea is still prominent in the English-speaking 
world. I think of the double meaning of the English word 
“property.” Property means “attribute” (German: 
Eigenschaft) as well as “belonging” (German: Eigentum). 
This double meaning can easily lead to a confusion of 
thinking. Nevertheless, this is not the only one pitfall of 
language that seems to justify Locke’s idea. The other pit￾fall appears in the double meaning of the pronoun “my.” 
In the English language as well as many other Indo￾Germanic languages, this pronoun is either a possessive 
pronoun that marks something as a belonging of the 
speaker or a pronoun of identity that characterizes some￾thing as consisting of certain elements. To elaborate, there 
is a categorical difference between “my action” and “my 
hammer.” My hammer is something that can also be used 
by others. My action cannot be done by others. Others can 
perform a similar action but this action is not my action. 
This shows that the word “my” in my action functions as 
an identity pronoun while in my hammer it functions as a 
possessive pronoun. If you confuse both meanings, then 
you may wrongly come to think that the hammer is part of 
my identity. Accordingly, it would be true to say, “I am not 
only a person. I am also a hammer.” Or, “being a hammer 
is part of my personality.” This is obviously nonsense.
In Locke’s argumentation, the word “my” is used in 
different meanings. His argumentation, therefore, falls 
Two Pitfalls of 
Language
Quaternio 
Terminorum
330 Chapter 17 · Fake Human Rights17
within the scope of a logical fallacy that is traditionally 
called quaternio terminorum fallacy (quadrupling of 
terms). A well-designed logical syllogism makes use of 
three terms. In the case of a quaternio terminorum, we 
have a syllogism with four terms. This makes the syllo￾gism a fallacy. The falsity of the conclusion is hidden by 
the fact that two different concepts are expressed with 
one and the same word. Locke’s syllogism is the follow￾ing:
» Premise 1: action x is my action (my = identity pronoun)
Premise 2: Product y is the result of my action x
Conclusion: Product y is my product (my = possessive 
pronoun)
Here we have not only three but four terms:
» Term 1 = action x
Term 2 = is mine (identity pronoun)
Term 3 = result y
Term 4 = is mine (possessive pronoun)
So, we must conclude that Locke’s argumentation in favor 
of the thesis that there is a human right to property is not 
convincing. It is based on incorrect thinking.
The modern positivistic theory of property goes back 
to David Hume (1711–1776). He regarded property simply 
as a matter of legislation. According to him, it is up to 
positive law to defne the scope of objects to which prop￾erty rights can be assigned. Secondly, it is up to positive 
law to defne the subjects that can own property rights. 
Thirdly, it is a question of positive law to determine how 
property rights can be acquired. Fourthly, there is positive 
legislation concerning the determination of those rights 
that defne the content of the property rights. The term 
“property” is only a purely legal term. It is only a term that 
summarizes the bundle of certain single positive rights 
and provisions.
Should we follow Hume? The crucial question that we 
must ask is the following. Is property a required condition 
for the development and maintenance of personhood? If 
we answer this question in the affrmative, then we must 
consider the right to property a human right. Answering 
otherwise leads to the opposite conclusion.
David Hume
331
17.1 · The Right to Property17
It is indeed necessary to have access to the material 
means of life, and private property can ensure this access. 
But it is also possible to have access to the means of life 
without having private or public property. Think of the 
monks and nuns who life in a monastery or the Sadhus in 
India. They do not hold private property but their means 
of life are ensured. Property gives, of course, more power 
to the owner and enlarges their scope of freedom. But this 
freedom refers only to the freedom of action and not nec￾essarily to the freedom of will. But only freedom of will is 
necessary for the development and maintenance of per￾sonhood.
Nevertheless, it is important to understand that prop￾erty rights are not to be confused with the subsistence 
minimum. The latter refers to the conditions of freedom 
of will and is therefore to be considered a matter of human 
rights. The former refers only to freedom of action. The 
concept of property refers not only to the ownership of 
the means of the subsistence minimum, but also to the for￾tune of a billionaire.
So, we come to the conclusion that the right to prop￾erty cannot be considered a human right. The fact that 
this right nevertheless appears in almost every classical 
human rights codifcation shows the strong infuence of 
the wealthy part of the national or international society 
when it comes to the codifcation of human rights. It also 
shows how the idea of how human rights can be misused 
and is misused in order to push forward selective or selfsh 
interests by dressing them in the royal garb of human 
rights.
The pure positive sense of property is clearly expressed 
in Article 14 (1) GG (see . Fig. 17.3). The content and 
limits of property are a matter of defnition by positive 
laws. It follows that property can only exist in the frame of 
a given legal order. There is no natural or human right to 
property. The legal order decides in which items can be 
owned, who can acquire property, and the range of rights 
and duties that are connected with property. Furthermore, 
it is also possible to change the property order by provid￾ing that it is no longer possible to acquire or to hold prop￾erty of a certain kind.
Such a change to the property order occurred in 
Germany with regard to the property of nuclear power 
plants. By the 13th Act Concerning the Modifcation of the 
Atomic Act of July 31, 2011, it was ruled that the construc￾tion of new nuclear power plants is prohibited. The exist￾332 Chapter 17 · Fake Human Rights17
. Fig. 17.3 Article 14 GG
ing nuclear power plants in Germany were also to be 
turned off according to a particular time schedule. (The 
last plant is to be turned off in April 2023). Three compa￾nies operating nuclear power plants fled a complaint 
against this law with the Federal Constitutional Court. 
They argued that the law constitutes an expropriation 
without compensation (see Article 14 (3) GG).
In its judgment of December 6, 2016, the Court decided 
that the fnal exit from nuclear power energy in Germany 
is not to be considered an expropriation, but only a new 
defnition to the content of property according to Article 
14 (1) sentence 2 GG. An expropriation occurs only if the 
object of property is taken from a specifc owner and 
transferred to a new owner. In this case, the property rights 
still exist. There is only a change in the ownership. In con￾trast, the law concerning the legal exit from nuclear power 
does not regulate the transfer of the ownership in nuclear 
power plants from one owner to another. It rather modi￾fes the defnition of property. It tells us that property in 
nuclear power plants does not exist anymore. Nobody in 
the country, including the state, can be an owner of nuclear 
power plants in future. Property rights in nuclear power 
plants will not exist just as property rights in the oxygen in 
the air around us do not exist. Property in nuclear power 
plants will, so to say, pass away simply by a new legal def￾nition.
The Court nevertheless recognized a right of the com￾panies in question to a certain amount of compensation. 
333
17.1 · The Right to Property17
But this compensation is not based on expropriation, but 
rather only on basis of the disappointment of expecta￾tions. In order to understand this, it is necessary to know 
that in 2001 the German Parliament issued a law accord￾ing to which the production of a certain amount of nuclear 
energy had been guaranteed to the companies. After the 
exhaustion of these amounts, the production of nuclear 
energy should be ceased. Furthermore, in a law of 2010 
the guaranteed amounts were enlarged. With the expecta￾tion of being able to enjoy the property of nuclear power 
plants for a while, the companies made some investments 
to modernize the plants. The abrupt halt to the production 
of nuclear power by the law of 2011 led to a disappoint￾ment of that expectation and to a devaluation of the 
investments. Only this devaluation was to be compensated. 
The legal principle behind this case law is not the principle 
of property, but only the principle of protection of legiti￾mate expectations.
17.2 Collective Human Rights
Now we come to the second important example of fake 
human rights. It is about the so-called human rights of the 
third generation. This expression goes back to Karel Vašák.
Vašák (1929–2015) was born in the former 
Czechoslovakia. He was a contributor to the drafting of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. From 1969 
to 1980, he worked for the Council of Europe before 
becoming the frst Secretary General of the International 
Institute of Human Rights in Strasbourg. He invented the 
notion of three “generations” of human rights, inspired by 
the three themes of the French Revolution (liberty, equal￾ity, and brotherhood). The frst time he used this notion 
was in an article that appeared in 1977. According to this 
idea, the history of human rights appears in three steps of 
enforcement.
The frst step refers to the liberal human rights. These 
are those rights with which I have dealt with in the 
7 Chaps. 8 through 14 and 16. They are characterized by 
the fact that they are pure rights of defense and protection 
against attacks that aim to harm a given state of human 
living conditions. The second step refers to the so-called 
social human rights that I have dealt with in 7 Chap. 15. 
They are characterized by the fact that they confer the 
right to demand the security of a certain state of humane 
334 Chapter 17 · Fake Human Rights17
living conditions or at least to demand support for the 
establishment of this state.
According to Vašák, there is now a third generation of 
human rights that consists in particular of the so-called 
collective rights. Collective rights are considered rights 
held by a group as a group rather than by its particular 
members; in contrast, liberal and social rights are consid￾ered individual rights that are held by individual persons.
17.2.1 Collective Rights in Positive Law
It is important to understand that the ban of discrimina￾tion based on certain group membership is covered by lib￾eral and social rights. For example, if someone is tortured 
while in prison because they are a member of a certain 
tribe whereas other inmates who do not belong to that 
group are not tortured, then this is simply a matter of the 
individual right to freedom from torture. It has nothing to 
do with group-related rights. The group-related rights also 
do not refer to so-called affrmative actions which aim to 
delete inequality between members of different groups. 
An important example is the so-called women’s quota in 
the law of employment in several states. According to 
these provisions, in a situation of two equally qualifed 
candidates for a certain job, one male and the other female, 
the employer must choose the female candidate as long as 
women in jobs of the same position are underrepresented 
as compared to men. This is also not a case of group￾rights because the right of the women to be favored is an 
individual right of each individual woman in the position 
of a job applicant.
A group-related right is also not codifed in Article 27 
ICCPR, which provides that persons who belong to 
minority groups shall not be denied the right to enjoy their 
own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or 
to use their own language in community with other mem￾bers of their group (see . Fig. 17.4). It is clear from the 
wording that this provision relates to individual human 
rights. The right “in community with others to enjoy their 
own culture” simply refers to the human right to assembly 
and the human right to association. The right to profess 
and practice religion obviously refers to the right to free￾dom of religion. Only the right to use one’s own language 
seems to be a right that is not identical to any other human 
right. Nevertheless, there is a dispute concerning whether 
335
17.2 · Collective Human Rights17
. Fig. 17.4 Article 27 ICCPR
. Fig. 17.5 Article 1 (1) UN Resolution 47/135
there is a moral human right to one’s own mother tongue. 
I will not discuss whether the right to free usage of lan￾guage is to be considered a human right. In our present 
context, it is enough to show that this right is in any case 
an individual right of individual persons and not a group￾related right.
On the level of global international human rights law, 
we have indeed no codifcation of collective human rights. 
Only one document could be understood as an introduc￾tion of collective rights. But this is only a document of soft 
law. It is the Resolution 47/135 of the UN General 
Assembly of December 18, 1992 on the rights of persons 
belonging to national or ethnic, religious, and linguistic 
minorities (see . Fig. 17.5). Most articles of this declara￾tion relate either to individual rights of group members or 
to general duties of the states. Only Article 1 could be read 
as establishing an original group right. According to this 
Article, states are obligated to protect not only particular 
members of a group, but also the existence and national or 
ethnic, cultural, religious, and linguistic identity of minor￾ities as such. This could be understood as a group-related 
right to collective identity.
On the level of regional human rights law, we have two 
conventions in Europe that refer to the rights of minori￾ties. These are the European Charter for Regional or 
Minority Languages of November 5, 1992 and the 
336 Chapter 17 · Fake Human Rights17
. Fig. 17.6 Article 22 (1) Banjul Charter
Framework Convention for the Protection of National 
Minorities of February 1, 1995. Both of them do not con￾tain group rights. They protect only the rights of “persons 
belonging to minorities” or enact duties of the contracting 
states—for example, the duty of administrative authorities 
to use the regional or minority languages. Nevertheless, 
there is an example for the codifcation of group-rights in 
the African parallel to the ECHR, the Banjul Charter of 
Human and Peoples’ Rights. This Charter already shows in 
its offcial name that collective rights (rights of peoples) 
and human rights (rights of human individuals) are con￾sidered as being on the same level. This is confrmed in 
Article 22 (1) of the Charter according to which peoples as 
such—as opposed to individuals—have the right to their 
economic, social, and cultural development (see 
. Fig. 17.6).
The Banjul Charter regards individual human rights as 
well as collective rights of the peoples as rights of the same 
sort. It therefore allows for the possibility of conficts 
between individual and collective rights, which cannot be 
resolved by reference to some ranking of the two or a gen￾eral preference for individual human rights. On the other 
hand, the Charter leaves open which rights are to be 
favored in such a confict.
17.2.2 Critique of the Idea of Collective 
Rights
I want to demonstrate this problem using an example from 
Canada that I have found in the work of Rhoda E. 
Howard. According to Canadian law, everybody enjoys 
the liberal human rights. Nevertheless, according to the 
Canadian law, the collective identity of the Indigenous 
tribes is also protected. Howard explains the following 
case.
337
17.2 · Collective Human Rights17
According to the Indigenous culture and worldview, 
which is constituent for their collective identity, there is a 
sacramental connection between the human body and the 
natural order. The natural order is considered not only as 
a matter of facts, but also as being part of a normative 
order. (We called this kind of thinking the Aristotelian 
approach, see 7 Chap. 2). Certain human behavior can 
disturb the natural order. It is possible, however, to recover 
the natural order by injuring the body of a human being. 
So, what we would consider torture is, in the worldview of 
the Indigenous tribes, considered a valuable sacrifce for 
the beneft of the entire tribe. Now the question is: should 
the state tolerate torture if it is committed in the frame of 
such a collective identity? Should the state intervene where 
an Indigenous individual that is to be tortured on such 
grounds has escaped from the tribe to apply for protec￾tion? Or is it necessary to extradite that person to the 
authorities of the tribe in order to respect the collective 
identity of the tribe? It is obvious that not every aspect of 
a conceivable collective identity is in a confict with human 
rights. But the example nevertheless shows that collective 
rights cannot be categorically considered as human rights.
The idea of collective human rights is seen by many of 
its proponents as a counter-concept to individual human 
rights. Its purpose is not necessarily to supplant individual 
human rights altogether, but to relativize them and weaken 
their authority. Behind this is the view that the individualis￾tic approach inherent in human rights promotes egoism and 
weakens social cohesion. This becomes clear in the follow￾ing quotation from Claude Ake: “The idea of human rights, 
or legal rights in general, presupposes a society which is 
atomized and individualistic … The values implicit in all 
this are clearly alien to those of our traditional societies. We 
put less emphasis on the individual and more on the col￾lectivity, we do not allow that the individual has any claims 
which may override that of the society.”
As has been shown in 7 Chaps. 5, 6 and 7, human rights 
and the principle of human dignity on which they are based 
are about the protection of personhood. Personhood, how￾ever, emerges from a process of equiprimordial recognition. 
Individual and society constitute each other. The idea that 
one can think of personhood in an “atomistic” and egoistic 
way thus completely misses the conditions for the emer￾gence and maintenance of personhood. Everyone owes 
themself to everyone else. But this does not mean that the 
individual is absorbed in the collective. For the collective 
338 Chapter 17 · Fake Human Rights17
consists of nothing but individual persons. It is the individ￾ual persons who produce the collective identity. Language 
and culture as features of collective identity emerge from 
the actively shaped life practice of the individuals, which at 
the same time form the cultural framework into which the 
individuals are born and by which they are shaped. The 
individual is at the same time a product of culture and they 
reproduce it through their own actions and life practice. 
This interdependence, however, does not allow the collec￾tive identity of the individual to be played off against their 
personal identity.
The idea of human rights is to protect the individual 
against their total absorption by the collective. Individual 
human rights defend individual positions against the 
expectations and claims of the collective. There is there￾fore a fundamental and principal contradiction between 
human rights and collective rights.
Furthermore, human rights are derived from human 
dignity and human dignity refers to the absolute value of 
personhood. The collective is not endowed with reason 
and conscience. Therefore, it is not endowed with person￾hood. Instead, collectives are pure ideas in our brains, 
intellectual or emotional constructions. They can never 
replace the position of individual persons that is based on 
human dignity.
This shows that collective human rights do not exist. 
There is no third generation of human rights.

Rights, Rules, and Principles
According to Ronald Dworkin, there is a difference 
between (moral/legal) rules and (moral/legal) princi￾ples. Rules describe a certain situation (legal facts) and 
provide that in a case where this situation occurs, a cer￾tain legal consequence should follow. In contrast, prin￾ciples do not determine the outcome of the case. They 
only provide arguments to balance against the argu￾ments in favor of conficting principles.
According to Robert Alexy, human rights are to be 
considered principles and not rules. So, Dworkin as 
well as Alexy do not take the notion “right” in “human 
rights” seriously.
Human Rights as Genuine Rights
Contrary to Dworkin and Alexy, it can be shown (see 
7 Chaps. 5 through 7) that one can derive genuine 
rights from the principle of human dignity and not just 
principles. Therefore, human rights are to be consider 
rules and not just principles. They protect the condi￾tions of the possibility to create one’s own free will.
Liberty
The term liberty should be used when it is about the 
freedom of action and not about freedom of will. Free￾dom of action refers to the freedom to do and to refrain 
from doing whatever someone wants to do or not do. 
Nevertheless, in order to ensure freedom of action for 
everybody, it is necessary to unite “the choice of one 
with the choice of another” (Kant). In other words, the 
limits of freedom of action of one are located where 
the freedom of action of the other begins. These limits 
have to be determined by a rule of a legal authority. 
From this follows that freedom of action can be guar￾anteed only under statutory reservations. Philosophi￾cally, this is not seen as problematic. For restrictions on 
the freedom of action do not usually threaten the per￾sonhood (except in the extreme cases of total institu￾tions). This is why liberty is not a matter of rights but a 
moral or legal principle of its own that should be 
strictly distinguished from human rights.
342 Chapter 18 · The Principle of Liberty18
Liberty as Based on Human Dignity
Although freedom of action is not the object of abso￾lute rights, there is a connection between freedom of 
action and human dignity. For respect toward freedom 
of will also entails, to some extent, respect toward free￾dom of action because the will refers to actions. But 
this relationship is much looser than is the case with 
human rights.
Principle of Proportionality
In order to make sure that the process of balancing 
between freedom of action of a particular person and 
conficting interests and values of other persons is com￾prehensible and rational, it is necessary to carry out 
this process in accordance with the principle of propor￾tionality. According to this principle, restrictions on 
freedom of action are only justifed if there is:
1. a legitimate end of the restriction; legitimate ends 
are the protection of the equal freedom of others 
and the democratically chosen aims of common 
cooperation. Morality as such is not to be consid￾ered a legitimate end as long as the behavior in ques￾tion does not infringe the rights and liberty of 
others. According to the rule of law, restrictions of 
the freedom of action are only admissible on the 
basis of generalized and abstract legal statutes;
2. suitability of the means in question;
3. necessity of the means in question; and
4. adequateness of means and ends (not using a sledge￾hammer to crack a nut).
18.1 Liberty in Positive Law
In order to understand the special character of human 
rights and to apply human rights in the right manner, it is 
useful to compare these rights with other principles of a 
legal order and to distinguish them in a proper way. The 
human rights discourse very often suffers from an insuff￾cient understanding of the difference between human 
rights and these other fundamental columns of a free 
order of society. This is the reason why in this chapter we 
343
18.1 · Liberty in Positive Law18
want to talk about the principle of liberty. In the next 
chapter, we will deal with another important element of a 
free and fair social order, namely the principle of equality.
So, let us turn our attention to the principle of liberty. 
It is interesting to realize that it is not mentioned in the 
international human rights codifcations. Yes, these codif￾cations mention “liberty” or the “liberty of the person” or 
even a “right to liberty” (Article 10 ICCPR). But these 
concepts refer only to the freedom from any kind of 
imprisonment or custody or to humane living conditions 
under detention. We talked about this issue in the ninth 
chapter. The principle of liberty should, however, be 
strictly distinguished from the habeas corpus rights.
Some constitutions indeed mention the concept of 
“liberty” without a close connection to the provisions con￾cerning the habeas corpus rights. An example of such a 
constitution is the one of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which 
begins its preamble with a reference to human dignity, lib￾erty, and equality (see . Fig. 18.1). This clause obviously 
refers to a distinction between the scope of human dignity, 
which includes the bundle of human rights, and the prin￾ciples of liberty and equality. Unfortunately, it is not clear 
what should be understood of liberty and according to 
which criteria it is to be distinguished from human dignity 
and human rights, on the one hand, and equality, on the 
other hand.
Nevertheless, there is a classical defnition of what is 
meant by liberty in Article 4 of the French Declaration of 
the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789 (see . Fig. 18.2). 
Here, we read that liberty consists of the freedom to do

everything which does not injure somebody else. The free￾dom to do everything can be called freedom of action. 
Freedom of action should have no limits except those 
which assure the other members of society the enjoyment 
of the same freedom. These limits of the freedom of action 
can only be determined by law.
French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen
Here, liberty is called a natural right. This could be 
understood in the meaning according to which liberty is 
identifed with human rights because human rights are 
often characterized as natural rights. Nevertheless, when 
keeping in mind that human rights are absolute rights 
which do not depend on the rights of others, then it 
becomes clear that the natural right of liberty refers to 
something different from human rights.
We fnd an improved version of the French defnition 
in Article 24 of the Constitution of Afghanistan of 2004 
(see . Fig. 18.3). While the French clause refers only to 
the natural rights and seems to mix human rights and the 
principle of liberty, the Afghan clause distinguishes 
clearly between each of them. Liberty is indeed defned 
as a natural right, but it is separate from human dignity. 
Human rights fall in the scope of human dignity, and 
liberty is a right which is also considered “natural,” but 
clearly distinguished from the scope of human rights. 
Another interesting point in the Afghan clause refers to 
the limits of the freedom of action. It cannot only be 
limited in the interest of the freedom of action of others 
but also in the public interest. This clause considers that 
freedom of action must also be restricted in order to 
raise taxes or to oblige citizens to clean the public walk￾ways in front of their homes, etc.
The liberty principle in US constitutional law is very 
remarkable. It is developed by the case law of the US 
Supreme Court and is called “substantive due process.”

18.1 · Liberty in Positive Law18
. Fig. 18.4 US Constitution
The codifed basis of the substantive due process doctrine 
is the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments of the US consti￾tution, according to which no person should be deprived 
of liberty “without due process of law” (see . Fig. 18.4). 
The Fifth Amendment relates to the Union while the 
Fourteenth Amendment relates to the States. The context 
shows that “liberty” refers to the personal liberty in the 
meaning of freedom from detention and custody. Both 
clauses provide that the deprivation of that freedom may 
only take place on the basis of a fair process. What is 
meant by fair or due process was clear for the drafters of 
the amendment because the expression “due process” was 
a well-established concept that referred to the habeas cor￾pus provisions of the Magna Charta Libertatum of 1215.
Beginning with the case Lochner v. New York of 1905, 
the US Supreme Court modifed the meaning of “liberty” 
and “due process.” The concept of “liberty” was freed 
from the connection to detention and penal law. It was 
understood in a much wider and more generalized sense, 
namely exactly in the meaning of the defnition of liberty 
according to the French Declaration of 1789. The concept 
of “due process” was freed from its reference to the proce￾dures of a trial and now was a material restriction of the 
discretionary scope of the legislator. Substantive due pro￾cess in this new meaning provides that any restriction of 
the freedom to do or to refrain from doing whatever some￾one wants to do or not do can only be restricted by a par￾liamentarian statute. This was what we call statutory 
reservation. Furthermore, the substantive due process doc￾trine requires that the statutory regulation be free from 
arbitrariness. What freedom from arbitrariness means in 
the concrete case is a matter of case law and falls to the 
responsibility of judges.
346 Chapter 18 · The Principle of Liberty18
. Fig. 18.5 Article 2 (1) GG
Free Development of 
the Personality
A quite similar development happened in Germany. 
However, here the starting point was not the habeas cor￾pus provisions of the Basic Law, but Article 2 (1) GG, 
according to which everyone has the right to free develop￾ment of their personality (see . Fig.  18.5). In order to 
understand the meaning of this clause, it is useful to con￾sider the drafting history. One of the early drafts of this 
article did not refer to the “free development of the per￾sonality”, but to the freedom “to do everything [that] does 
not harm others.” 1 According to a later draft everybody 
should be entitled to “freely do or omit what does not 
injure the rights of others and is not against the constitu￾tional order and morality.” 2
The fnal formulation should not change anything in 
the meaning of the article. The expression “free develop￾ment of the personality” appeared to the drafters only as 
more sophisticated and better suited for displaying the 
great weight of the provision. In particular, the draft of 
the UDHR had a certain infuence insofar as Article 22

18.1 · Liberty in Positive Law18
declares that economic, social, and cultural rights are 
“indispensable for his dignity and the free development of 
his personality.”
The expression “free development of the personality” 
was nevertheless very ambiguous. On the one hand, it was 
an expression from traditional philosophical language. A 
similar expression (“development of human powers”) can 
already be found, for example, in Wilhelm von Humboldt’s 
On the Limits of State Action of 1792 (frst printed in 
1851—7 Chap. 2). John Stuart Mill quoted Humboldt in 
his book On Liberty (1859, 7 Chap. 3), using the expres￾sion “free development of personality.” On the other 
hand, the expression was very often confused with the 
concept of human dignity, and the difference was never 
really clear. In 1947, the German legal philosopher and 
professor of constitutional law Helmut Coing held the 
opinion that “free development of personality” and 
“human dignity” are only two different expressions of the 
same idea. 3
It is necessary to know this history in order to under￾stand what happened in the year 1957 when the BVerfG 
issued its “Elfes” Judgment. In this decision, the Court 
laid down the general principles of the distinction between 
human dignity and “the right to free development of the 
personality.” Nevertheless, it considered the understand￾ing of Humboldt as well as the contrary understanding of 
Coing and stated that the “right to free development of 
the personality” has a double meaning. The Court, 
therefore, declared that Article 2 (1) GG refers to human 
dignity as well as to the principle of liberty. Concerning 
the latter, the provision referred to the protection of free￾dom of action. Regarding the former, the provision 
referred to the protection of freedom of will. Unfortunately, 
the Court did not clarify the function of the clauses about 
the reservations concerning the rights of others, the con￾stitutional order, and morality. From a philosophically 
clarifed position of the meaning of human dignity, it is 
obvious that these reservations can only be related to free￾dom of action and not to the free development of person￾ality in the meaning of human dignity (freedom of will). 
Regarding human dignity, the scope of personal self￾determination should be considered as untouchable and 
not restrictable as it is declared in Article 1 GG, according 
3 Coing SJZ 1947, 641.
“Elfes” Judgment
348 Chapter 18 · The Principle of Liberty18
to which the dignity of man is untouchable. In the case law 
that has continued to modern day, it has become common 
practice to quote “Article 2 (1) i.c.w. Art. 1 (1) GG” (i.c.w. 
= in combination with) when it is considered as referring 
to human dignity—i.e., to freedom of will. Comparatively, 
the isolated quotation of Article 2 (1) GG only refers to 
freedom of action.
18.2 The Content of the Principle of Liberty
So, it becomes clear what the principle of liberty means 
and what the difference between this principle and human 
rights is. Human rights are always related to the protection 
of freedom of will because freedom of will is the constitu￾tional element or characteristic of personhood and per￾sonhood is the object of an absolute value (dignity). 
Comparatively, the principle of liberty only refers to free￾dom of action.
Freedom of action is not absolutely protected. It does 
not guarantee an absolute position, which under all cir￾cumstances is protected against any diminution. It is the 
function of positive law to defne the limits of everyone’s 
freedom of action.
Nevertheless, if freedom of action can be restricted by 
positive law (sometimes to a minimum) and if it does not 
protect any absolute position, then what is its function? Its 
function is the implementation of a special rule of distrib￾uting the burden of argumentation and justifcation. 
Under the principle of liberty, it is not the burden of the 
individual to present arguments and justifcations in order 
to convince public authorities that they should not restrict 
the freedom of action. Rather, it is up to the public author￾ities to present arguments and justifcations for why the 
restriction of the freedom of action is necessary. 
Furthermore, it is not enough to have good arguments in 
favor of the restriction of liberty. These arguments must 
be adopted by parliament and made into a statute. For 
only on the basis of a statute that authorizes interventions 
may restrictions of liberty take place. So, the intervention 
into liberty is under democratic control. This is why we 
can call states under the principle of liberty liberal states.
The principle of liberty is the exact opposite of what 
applies in illiberal states. Here the rule is: the government 
must not justify interventions in the scope of individual 
freedom. It is rather the individual that takes the burden

349
18.2 · The Content of the Principle of Liberty18
of convincing the government of the freedoms they want 
to enjoy. Respect or disrespect toward the principle of lib￾erty makes the difference between a liberal and an illiberal 
state.
Here, I want to point to a current development inside 
the European Union that can only be considered a catas￾trophe and a serious danger not only for the fourishing, 
but also for the survival of the unique EU project. There 
are several EU member states that are governed by politi￾cians who defend the idea of an illiberal state. And they do 
it very openly. For instance, the Prime minister of Hungary 
Viktor Orbán wants to transfer Hungary from a liberal 
democracy to an illiberal state. He speaks expressively of 
an illiberal or non-liberal state. However, he is not alone. 
We can observe a current worldwide tendency to vote for 
populistic politicians who frankly demand the abolition of 
the principle of liberty. The attraction of such political 
ideas seems to be based on many people’s desire to be 
guided and fostered by big, powerful men. This relieves 
them of the burden of freedom, which is always associated 
with responsibility and the risk of failure. But let us return 
to our topic.
18.3 Rules and Principles
Article 2 (1) GG as well as the French Declaration of 1789 
and almost all the other legal documents that are related 
to liberty do not use the term “principle” but the term 
“right.” All of them are talking of a right to liberty or of a 
right to the free development of personality. Nevertheless, it 
is hardly possible to take the term “right” seriously when 
we consider that this so-called right to liberty stands under 
multiple reservations—the reservation of the rights of 
others, the reservation of morality, the reservation of the 
constitutional order or of the public interest.
This confusing use of the expression “right” is the 
result of a quite poor language. Confusions of language 
are mostly based in a confusion of thoughts. So, we can 
say that the use of only one and the same expression for 
obviously different concepts stems from a lack of con￾sciousness about the difference between these concepts. 
Nevertheless, in the meanwhile this confusion of thought 
and language has been overcome. It was particularly the 
American legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin (*1931) who 
discovered and explained the difference between rules and 
Rules
350 Chapter 18 · The Principle of Liberty18
principles. He saw that judicial decisions are not only 
based on rules, but also on principles. Rules describe a cer￾tain situation (legal facts) and determine that in a case 
where this situation occurs, a certain legal consequence 
should follow. For example, if the rule provides that a tes￾tamentary document is invalid if it is not signed in the 
presence of two witnesses, then you cannot inherit on the 
basis of a testamentary document that has not been signed 
in the presence of two witnesses. Rules always apply in an 
all-or-nothing way. Either you can inherit or you cannot. 
According to the rule, there is no other way. An important 
characteristic of legal rules is that they can stand in con￾fict to each other. In such a situation, the question of 
what should be done cannot be answered. In order to 
avoid such dilemmas, it is a very important element of a 
legal order to provide for rules that determine which one 
of the conficting rules should be favored. In the event that 
there is no such rule that solves the confict, both rules are 
considered invalid. I am going to come back to this issue 
in the last chapter.
Principles are different. They do not determine the 
outcome of a case. They deliver certain topics that are to 
be balanced against the topics of conficting principles. 
The process of balancing takes place within the scope of 
judicial discretion. This scope is only restricted by the 
number of principles that a judge has to take into account. 
But the result of the process is not determined by law. 
Unsolvable conficts between competing principles are not 
possible because it is always possible to fnd a compro￾mise.
This distinction between rules and principles was taken 
over by the German legal philosopher Robert Alexy 
(∗1945). In addition to Dworkin, Alexy defnes legal prin￾ciples as commandments of optimization. Legal principles 
command the realization of the idea of the principle con￾cerned to the greatest possible extent. If there is a confict 
between two different legal principles, like with Dworkin, 
it is a matter of balancing and fnding a compromise to 
what extent the two competing ideas can be realized. This 
process of balancing stands within the scope of discretion 
of the deciding judge.
Alexy applies this doctrine not only to the “right” to 
liberty, but also to human rights. He holds the opinion 
that both of them are to be considered legal principles. So, 
he comes to the conclusion that in a confict between 
human rights as well as in a confict between liberty and 
Principles
Commandments of 
Optimization
351
18.3 · Rules and Principles18
other legal principles, there must always be exercised a 
process of balancing. According to the doctrine I defended 
in this lecture, the understanding of human rights as mere 
legal principles in the meaning of Dworkin and Alexy is 
not adequate. Considering that the protection scope of 
human rights is derived from human dignity—i.e., from 
the absolute value of personhood—it is not possible to 
balance between conficting human rights or where there 
are conficts between human rights and other principles.
Dworkin and Alexy argue that conficts between 
human rights were not avoidable and that the legal order 
by defnition, and regardless of the particular circum￾stances, must always keep solutions for norm conficts in 
stock. This, however, is not a suffcient argument in favor 
of the application of the principle-doctrine to human 
rights. How we can deal with conficts in the feld of 
human rights is the issue of the last chapter. Here, I want 
to only say that from the alleged fact that a confict 
between human rights is not solvable when we understand 
human rights as absolute rights does not necessarily follow 
that this doctrine must be false. It is also possible that the 
doctrine of the completeness of the legal system can be 
false and that it is not true that legal systems always keep 
in stock solutions for every norm confict.
Now I come back to the so-called right to liberty. As 
we have seen before, liberty refers to freedom of action. 
Restrictions of that freedom normally do not lead to the 
weakening or even to the destruction of personhood. If 
we are restricted in what we want to do, we are normally 
free to oppose the restriction. We can be outraged and we 
can protest it. In other words, we can take action against 
the restriction according to our own free will. This shows 
that normally restrictions to freedom of action do not lead 
to a restriction of freedom of will. I want to demonstrate 
that with the following graphics.
Consider someone who is sitting in a room while the 
door is closed. They could leave the room because the 
door is closed, but not locked (see . Fig. 18.6). Still, they 
believe that it is not possible to leave the room because 
they think it is locked. Therefore, they will not create the 
will to leave the room.
Someone is sitting in a room. They decide to leave the 
room, stand up, go to the door and shake the door handle. 
But they cannot open the door because it is locked (see 
. Fig. 18.7).

Which of these two cases tells us a story about a restric￾tion to the freedom of will and which one tells a story 
about freedom of action? It is obvious that in the second 
case the person has a free will although they cannot trans￾form it into a successful action. In the frst case, there is no 
restriction of freedom of action, but there is a restriction 
of freedom of will because the person is not able to pro￾duce the will to leave the room. This inability is based on 
wrong information about the true situation. If the inabil￾ity is caused by a simple error, we can talk about the real￾ization of the ordinary risks of life. If the inability is based 
on wrong information given by a warden in order to pre￾vent the person from leaving the room—let’s tell them that 
the lock is out of order—then we have to talk about a vio￾lation of human rights.
353
18.3 · Rules and Principles18
There is, however, a degree of reduction of freedom 
of action that sooner or later leads to a deprivation of 
free will. This is particularly the case in so-called total 
institutions (see 7 Chap. 9). But besides this extreme 
situation, the reduction of the free scope of action does 
not lead to an infringement of will and of personhood. 
This is why the right to liberty is not to be considered a 
human right. It is rather a legal principle in the meaning 
of Dworkin and Alexy. This principle demands an opti￾mization of freedom of action, but it allows to take con￾ficting principles and aims into consideration. This is 
why the reservation clauses concerning the rights of oth￾ers, the public interest, and morality can be easily under￾stood as references to conficting principles that makes it 
possible to balance between maximizing individual inter￾est to its greatest freedom and the interest of others, of 
the public, etc.
18.4 The Philosophical Foundation 
of the Principle of Liberty
Before we take a detailed look at the process of balancing, 
I will focus on whether there is a philosophical foundation 
for the principle of liberty.
I think the principle of liberty is also connected with 
the principle of human dignity. But the connection is not 
so close like it is in the case of human rights. It is much 
looser. Human dignity primarily refers to freedom of will 
and not to freedom of action. Nevertheless, absolute 
respect toward freedom of will also demands or includes a 
relative respect toward freedom of action. To develop a 
free will only makes sense in regard of the transformation 
of will into action. Restrictions on the freedom of action 
do not violate freedom of will, but respect toward the will 
includes a certain respect toward the action that is based 
on that will. This respect is not absolute but only relative. 
But it is nevertheless a kind of respect. That relative respect 
is shown by the attempt to optimize the scope of the free￾dom of action and by the duty to justify any restriction of 
the freedom of action toward the person concerned.
I would, however, defend the thesis that the connection 
between human dignity and the principle of liberty is so

human persons independent of the legal ties between 
them. I do not believe that we can defne suffciently clear 
moral rules of conduct that would allow one to respect the 
principle of liberty even in the state of nature. Perhaps we 
can say that total ignorance and indifference to the wishes 
of others, even in the state of nature, must be considered 
immoral. But what degree of taking care of the wishes of 
others should be considered as relevant and how exactly 
this has to happen seems to be unanswerable to me for the 
state of nature. The reason is that in the state of nature 
there is no neutral instance that can defne the limits of the 
freedom of everybody by considering the interests of 
everybody in a suffcient and impartial way. In other 
words, the principle of liberty does not take a relevant role 
in the state of nature because of a lack of a public institu￾tion that provides for the scope of individual freedom and 
its limits.
In order to ensure an optimization of an individual 
scope of freedom of action, it is therefore a good idea for 
individuals to integrate themselves into the system of a 
state and a legal order that provides suffcient care for the 
principle of liberty. Only in the frame of a legal order is it 
possible to take all or at least the most competing interests 
into account in order to defne the limits of the individual 
freedom and to optimize the scope of the individual free￾dom of everyone. This is why we must conclude that the 
principle of liberty cannot be considered a supra-positive 
moral standard. It is rather an element of the rule of law 
and as such an element of a decent legal order. It is appli￾cable and valid only in the frame of the legal order and 
therefore a pure legal concept insofar as there is a crucial 
difference between the principle of liberty and human 
rights. The latter are legal rights that are based on moral 
rights. As moral rights, they are valid and applicable also 
in the state of nature.
18.5 The Legal Instruments for Taking Care 
of Liberty
The determination of the scope of freedom of action in a 
particular case demands a process of balancing competing 
interests in a suffciently large scope of freedom. According 
to American case law, this process of balancing is not 
clearly structured so that very often it is very diffcult or

Order
355

Legitimate Purpose
even not possible to subject this process to rational control 
from outside. The process of balancing takes place in a 
black box (see . Fig. 18.8). Conficting interests or values 
are put in the box, and in the end the decision is taken out 
of the box. But what happens inside the box during the 
process of balancing is mostly hidden. The disadvantages 
of this approach are, however, compensated by a strict 
binding to precedents.
In present day Europe there is another dominating 
approach, namely the so-called principle of proportional￾ity (see . Fig. 18.8). So far as I can see this principle was 
not on the judicial agenda before the second half of the 
nineteenth century. The term proportionality appeared in a 
textbook of administrative law by Otto Mayer that was 
published in 1885 for the frst time. In 1955 a doctoral the￾sis appeared that developed the principle of proportional￾ity more or less in the meaning as it is understood in our 
days. The German case law took over this new doctrine in 
a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court of 1971. 
As early as 1970, the Court of Justice of the European 
Community had already mentioned this doctrine in the 
framework of European law. From there, it infuenced the 
national case law of almost all EU member states.
The principle of proportionality tries to make what 
happens inside the black box transparent. It is supposed to 
rationally structure the process of balancing and make it 
comprehensible. The principle of proportionality demands 
a process of balancing that is organized according to four 
steps. Only if these four steps are taken can the process be 
considered rational and comprehensible.
The frst step requires a legitimate purpose for the 
restriction of the freedom of action. The requirement of a 
legitimate purpose already appeared in the philosophical 
356 Chapter 18 · The Principle of Liberty18
thinking of the eighteenth century about the freedom of 
action. The philosophical considerations are refected in 
the restriction grounds that are mentioned in the codifca￾tions of the principle of liberty. The law defnes three or 
four restriction grounds.
I think the ground for restriction of the same liberty of 
others is easy to justify. The principle of liberty is based on 
mutual respect and not only on an egoistic interest in one’s 
own freedom of action. The restriction ground of confor￾mity with the constitutional order refers to the fact that 
the state, within the framework of the constitution, defnes 
common goals of society and organizes their realization. 
The pursuit of such collective goals requires, among other 
things, the restriction of freedom of action, because the 
choice of a common goal and the organization of coop￾eration implies that the individual must renounce confict￾ing private goals and contradictory actions. The ground 
for restriction of public interest has no divergent meaning 
than the ground of accordance with the constitutional 
order. Public interests always refer to common goals, 
which are goals of the constitution itself or goals that are 
chosen by parliament within the frame of the democratic 
process.
The reason for restriction of morality seems me, how￾ever, illegitimate. Moral convictions are always a private 
matter because only natural individuals are endowed with 
conscience and are therefore responsible for a life in accor￾dance with their own convictions about good and evil. Of 
course, people must not forget their moral convictions 
when they are acting as citizens. They can, for example, 
vote for politicians who want to establish moral aims as 
legal aims through legislation. But the only way to inte￾grate moral aims in the law is the way of the constitutional 
democratic process. If a majority of voters share the opin￾ion that it is immoral to be naked on the streets, they can 
vote for politicians who make a law which prohibits being 
naked on the streets. But if such a law does not exist, it is 
not legitimate to reduce the freedom of action by a police 
order simply on grounds of “morality.”
The second step of the principle of proportionality 
refers to the suitability of the intervention. The interven￾tion in the scope of the freedom of action must be suitable 
in order to achieve the purpose. I shall give a (negative) 
example: Let us assume that the aim of the restriction of 
liberty is to prevent infection with viruses in order to con￾tain a pandemic. For this purpose, the state prescribes that 
Suitability
357
18.5 · The Legal Instruments for Taking Care of Liberty18
everyone must drink two liters of lukewarm water every 
day. This measure would not be an appropriate means to 
achieve the goal. It would therefore be incompatible with 
the principle of liberty.
The third step of the principle of proportionality refers 
to the necessity of the means to achieve the purpose. 
Necessary are only those means which least intervene in 
freedom but which are still suitable for achieving the 
desired legitimate purpose. For example, if a riot can be 
terminated by using a water cannon or by shooting at the 
insurgents, the water cannons are the necessary means. It 
is not necessary to shoot at them in order to achieve the 
goal.
The fourth step of the principle of proportionality 
refers to the adequateness of means and ends. It is, so to 
say, not adequate to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. 
For example, when groups of Hooligans are fghting each 
other and threatening damage to shop windows, it would 
not be adequate to shoot at the Hooligans because it is not 
adequate to defend a good of relative low value (shop win￾dows) by destroying goods of relative high value (human 
life). If no other means are available to end the fght, the 
police may not intervene.
It is obvious that the application of the principle of 
proportionality is not like a mathematical calculation. 
There is of course a large margin of appreciation or dis￾cretion in the application of the principle. Nevertheless, it 
structures the process of balancing and allows to a certain 
extent some rational control. So, it serves the purpose of 
minimalizing interventions and restrictions on the free￾dom of action while also optimizing the realization of that 
freedom.

“Equal” Rights
The expression “equal rights” in some human rights 
instruments does not refer to the principle of equality. 
It repeats only what is self-evident for human rights: 
that everyone is entitled to enjoy them, that is, that no 
one may be infringed by a violation of them. This con￾stitutes the general character of human rights and has 
nothing to do with equality.
The Principle of Equality
The principle of equality can only meaningfully be 
applied to the relationship of the members of a coopera￾tive community. It refers to the standards of distribu￾tion of burdens and benefts of the cooperation. 
Privileges need particular arguments that can show their 
rational acceptance by the least privileged members of 
the community. Beyond the frame of cooperative com￾munities, there is no moral reason for any equal treat￾ment.
In contrast, some philosophers who call themselves 
Egalitarians assert that equality in the meaning of equal 
treatment is the self-evident substantial principle of any 
morality and must therefore apply to all human beings 
or living entities, regardless of whether they are mem￾bers of the same cooperative community (the Presump￾tion of Equality Thesis).
The Discrimination Ban
Discriminating actions relating to the reduction of free￾dom of action cannot be considered a matter of human 
rights even where the actions are motivated by racist or 
gender related grounds or the like. Nevertheless, they 
must be banned in the interest of preventing conduct 
that at some point may lead to serious violations of 
human rights. This is one of the aims of the positive 
law of a decent state.
362 Chapter 19 · The Principle of Equality19
. Fig. 19.1 Article 1 UDHR
19.1 The General Appearance of Equality 
Within Human Rights Codifcations
There is still another important principle that is to be 
strictly distinguished from the corpus of human rights. 
That is the principle of equality. Nevertheless, there are 
huge misunderstandings concerning the characteristic of 
equality in the context of human rights. The reason for 
this is that equality seems to be mentioned very often in 
human rights codifcations. This is why many philosophers 
think that there is a close connection between human 
rights and equality, or even that equality can be consid￾ered a specifc object of a human right.
Contrary to the principle of liberty, the principle of 
equality—or maybe the right to equality—seems to be 
mentioned more often in human rights codifcations. 
Article 1 UDHR starts with the declaration that “all 
human beings are equal in dignity and rights” (see 
. Fig. 19.1). Furthermore, Article 2 of the same provides 
that “everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set 
forth in this Declaration” (see . Fig. 19.2). In a similar 
way, the ECHR declares in Article 14 that the “enjoyment 
of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention 
shall be secured without discrimination.” (see . Fig. 19.3).
Do these provisions add something to the list of human 
rights? Do they express something particular to a specifc 
human right? The answer is “obviously not,” if we con￾sider that each of the other articles of the Convention

Bans
dealing with a particular human right start with the words 
“Everybody” or “No one.” There is only one exception. 
Article 12 ECHR refers to the right to marry and the right 
to establish a family. These rights are guaranteed only for 
men and women. Obviously, the convention does not 
touch on the issue of transgender people, which at the 
time of the drafting process was not an issue of public 
debate. If someone were to argue that transgender people 
do not possess the right to marry and establish a family, 
Article 14 ECHR could become relevant to such discus￾sion. For it prohibits the discrimination on the basis of 
sex. Nevertheless, I think we can set this case aside. 
Considering that the ECHR is considered a “living instru￾ment” (see 7 Chaps. 1 and 10), it is easy to include trans￾gender people in the frame of “men and women.” By 
doing so, we understand Article 12 ECHR as a means of 
conferring the right to marry and the right to establish a 
family to everybody. This leads to the initial conclusion 
that any kind of discrimination in terms of a person’s 
enjoyment of any individual human right is automatically 
prohibited. In this regard, Articles 1 and 2 UDHR as well 
as Article 14 ECHR do not add anything to the list of 
human rights. In other words, they cannot be considered 
separate human rights.
Does this result change if we take into consideration 
that Article 2 UDHR and Article 14 ECHR prohibit any 
discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, color, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social ori￾gin, association with a national minority, property, birth, 
or other status? Obviously not. Considering that including 
the words “everybody” or “no one” with each individual 
human right ensures that nobody is excluded from pos￾sessing human rights, any such exclusion similarly could 
not be perpetrated on the basis of particular grounds. So, 
it seems to be obvious that the quoted clauses of the 
UDHR as well as of the ECHR are simply superfuous. 
364 Chapter 19 · The Principle of Equality19
. Fig. 19.4 Article 20 EU Charter
They repeat only what is already said in the individual 
human rights provisions.
The case law of the ECtHR confrms this view. There 
are several decisions of the ECtHR where the court deter￾mined a violation of Article 14 based on discrimination of 
the applicants when exercising their human right. 
Accordingly, the court decided that the prohibition of 
public demonstrations of LGBT activists by Russian 
authorities violates not only their right to free assembly 
(Article 11 ECHR), but also the discrimination ban of 
Articles 14 ECHR. Nonetheless, whether the court deter￾mines a violation of Article 11 ECHR alone, or a violation 
of Article 14 ECHR as well makes no difference. It is 
important that the violation is not based on the act of dis￾crimination, but on the oppression of the communication 
rights.
The reference to equal rights has nothing to do with 
the principle of equality. It stresses only the generality of 
human rights. Equality would come into play only if it 
were true that person A may enjoy the human rights only 
because person B also enjoys them and because there 
would be a principle according to which person A and per￾son B should be treated equally. But this is not what is 
meant by “equal rights.” Person A enjoys human rights 
only because they are a person and regardless of what is 
going on with other persons.
19.2 Is There a Human Right to Equality?
So, we come to the conclusion that the classical human 
rights codifcations do not contain the principle of equality. 
But what about Article 20 of the EU Charter of 
Fundamental Rights (see . Fig.  19.4) and Article 3 (1) 
GG (see . Fig. 19.5)? These clauses declare that all per￾sons are equal before the law. This text comes from the 
German Constitution of 1849. The idea behind the word￾ing was to hinder courts of law and administrations from 
applying the same law differently depending on whether 
they had to deal with an issue of someone from the lower 
classes or someone from the higher classes. The law should

be applied equally. Nowadays, this rule is also quoted to 
indicate that not only the application of a law but also the 
content of the law itself has to comply with the standard of 
equality. The law itself may not discriminate. Our question, 
however, is whether these clauses express a genuine human 
right or whether they refer to something different. So, the 
question is again whether there is a free-standing principle 
of equality that cannot be derived from human dignity or 
whether these clauses express a separate human right.
We have already dealt with the problem of equality in 
7 Chap. 3. Now, I want to take a deeper look at the issue. 
In order to understand the characteristic of equality, it is 
very useful to refer to a metaphor that was coined by the 
Swiss philosopher Angelika Krebs (∗1961). She explains 
the categorical difference between human rights and 
equality by using the picture of a beam scale and a deci￾mal scale (see . Fig.  19.6). Equality refers only to the 
equilibrium of the two pans of a beam scale. It does not 
matter what is on the pan. It is only crucial that the weight 
of one pan is exactly as high or low as the weight of the 
other pan. In contrast, human rights are like a decimal 
scale. They deliver an absolute standard of what is needed 
for a dignifed life. If this minimum threshold is not met, 
then human beings are living under inhuman conditions, 
regardless of whether they are the only person in such 
conditions or if they are one of many persons that are 
equally affected by the same conditions. If a person suffers 
from a lack of the goods which are protected by human 
366 Chapter 19 · The Principle of Equality19
rights, then the problem is not that the needs of other peo￾ple are satisfed. The problem is that the person in need 
does not possess what they need for a dignifed life, regard￾less of the situation of other persons.
The standards of human rights are objective standards 
while the standards of equality are relative standards. 
Equality always refers to human beings as elements of a 
collective web. Equality is a principle of distribution of bur￾dens and benefts among the members of a group. Equality 
always depends on what the individual deserves in relation 
to each other members of the relevant group. Equality, 
therefore, is a standard of justice in cooperative structures.
Human rights, in contrast, always refer to human 
beings as particular individuals. Human rights are not a 
matter of distribution. Human rights are not things that 
can only be enjoyed by those who deserve them. Human 
rights are not things that must be earned. Human rights 
are standards of justice that relate to all living entities who 
are endowed with the capacity for personhood. So, human 
rights are never a matter of comparison. This shows that 
the principle of equality is an independently existing prin￾ciple. It is to be strictly distinguished from human rights.
Nevertheless, the idea that equality only refers to the 
members of a cooperative community and to the question 
of how the burdens and the benefts of cooperation should 
be distributed among its members is in our days very con￾troversial. There is a group of very infuential philoso￾phers who share the opinion that equality and not human 
dignity is the fundamental principle of any universal 
morality. They call themselves Egalitarians (Gosepath, 
Tugendhat). They hold the opinion that membership in a 
cooperative community is not a required condition for 
applying the principle of equality. Instead, the required 
condition for the principle of equality is simply the gen￾eral competence to cooperate. Therefore, they conclude 
that the principle is applicable to all human beings or at 
least to all persons. Other Egalitarians go beyond that, 
defending the thesis that equality does not refer to coop￾eration, but to equal natural properties like the ability to 
suffer (Singer). From this point of view, they conclude that 
the principle of equality also applies to the relationship 
between human beings and animals. In any case, the prin￾ciple of equality in the Egalitarian sense means that equal 
treatment is always morally justifed if there are no excep￾tionally particular reasons to treat subjects differently. The 
differentiation, and not the equality or the equal treat￾Characteristic of

19.2 · Is There a Human Right to Equality?19
ment, must be justifed. This is called the presumption of 
equality thesis. The principle of equality is in this meaning 
a principle that regulates the burden of argumentation. It 
is a procedural principle. In the eyes of Egalitarians, the 
principle of equality is self-evident. It does not need any 
further justifcation or argumentation.
I guess that this approach is based on a certain kind of 
fallacy that consists in illogically enlarging a principle 
beyond the system for which it is justifed by ignoring the 
specifc conditions of that system. The requirement of 
equal treatment under the condition of cooperation 
becomes enlarged beyond the system of cooperation by 
ignoring that only cooperation delivers the sense under 
which equal treatment can be justifed. The requirement 
of equal treatment is not self-evident. It is well grounded 
in the argument of cooperation. Without this argument, 
equal treatment is not self-evident and suffers from a lack 
of justifcation.
The presumption of equality thesis reminds me of a 
famous argument by which the theologians of the Middle 
Ages tried to prove the existence of God. They argued that 
every phenomenon in the world is caused—that is, every 
worldly phenomenon is based on causation. So, they con￾cluded that whatever exists is caused. If the world as a 
whole exists, it must have been caused. And the cause of 
the world as a whole is what they called God. They ignored 
the fact that systemic conditions are only applicable to the 
system in question and not to relationships that go beyond 
such a system. They overlooked that the conditions inside 
the world do not imply the same conditions for a system in 
which the world is only an element.
19.3 Is There a Human Right Against 
Discrimination on Reasons of “Race”, 
Color, Sex, Etc.?
So far, we have clarifed that human rights by defnition 
refer to every human person so that human rights are not 
equal rights but the same rights. Equality is something dif￾ferent from human rights. Furthermore, we have clarifed 
that the principle of equality refers to the fair allocation of 
the burdens and benefts of cooperation among the par￾ticipants of the respective cooperative community. 
Equality is therefore not a universal standard, but a stan￾Systemic Fallacy

Grounds of Unavail￾able Properties

dard that can only be applied to particular communities. 
There is, however, still another aspect of equality. There is 
a kind of unequal treatment that is not connected with fair 
sharing of burdens and benefts, but with a kind of 
devaluation and humiliation in regard to certain attributes 
of human individuals that are immutable or otherwise 
unreasonable for humans to change. I think of cases where 
individuals are treated unequally because of their sex, 
“race,” color, language, religion, political or other opin￾ion, social origin, association with a national minority, 
and the like (unavailable properties), without violating 
human rights.
Take the case of two fight assistants. Both of them 
earn an appropriate amount of money, but one of them 
earns 400 EURO less than the other because the former is 
female while the latter is male. We can discuss this case in 
terms of a fair burden-beneft distribution, but it is also 
possible to understand the unequal payment as an expres￾sion of a devaluation and humiliation of the female sex. 
The same is true for the case of the Roman Catholic 
Church where women, in principle, do not have access to 
higher offces like the offce of a priest or a bishop. Is it 
because the men in the church want to defend their privi￾leges on egoistic grounds or is their behavior steered by a 
fundamental attitude of devaluation and humiliation of 
the female sex? In the following case the situation is clearer. 
Someone is denied access to a public theater or restaurant 
simply because they are black. There are no tiers of coop￾eration between someone who wants to visit a theater and 
the owner of the theater who denies entry. In this case, 
cooperation between the two only starts with the granting 
of access because a contract has been executed between 
the two that establishes a community of cooperation 
between them. So, here we have a case where it is very clear 
that the situation is not motivated by egoistic interests in 
an unfair beneft-burden distribution, but simply by the 
racist attitude of the owner. The owner regards the appli￾cant as unworthy to visit the theater solely because of their 
skin color. How should we consider cases of this kind?
Some philosophers hold the opinion that such discrim￾inating attitudes must be considered violations of human 
rights because race or gender discrimination and the like 
constitute a disregard for human dignity. They think that 
there is a need for rights which defend and protect against 
such acts of disregard. Rights which serve the defense and

19.3 · Is There a Human Right Against Discrimination on Reasons…19
protection against the disregard of human dignity are to 
be regarded as human rights. It follows that there is a 
human right not to be discriminated against on the 
grounds of sex, race, etc. These philosophers consider 
human dignity as a status or a rank that demands a certain 
kind of respect toward the bearer of the status. So, deny￾ing access to a theater solely on the basis of skin color is, 
so to say, an act of “lèse-majesté.” Human rights have the 
function of protecting the holder against such acts of lèse￾majesté (Waldron, Stöcker).
Nevertheless, this is not an understanding of human 
dignity and human rights that is based on the absolute 
value of personhood. Being denied access to a theater 
does not put a person at risk of having their personhood 
infringed. This also applies if access to a theater is denied 
not because of inability to pay for a ticket, but for racist 
reasons. These cases of discrimination are therefore not to 
be considered a violation of human rights.
Nevertheless, this is only a part of the story. We also 
have to take into account that a regular and wide spread 
social practice of excluding people from theaters solely on 
grounds of their skin color produces a social atmosphere 
where such people are forced to regard themselves as infe￾rior because they are regarded as inferior by their fellow 
humans. They lose the awareness and self-esteem as per￾sons and cease to trust in their own competence to lead 
their life on the basis of their own considerations and 
refections. They will then start to subject themselves to 
the will of others. At the same time, the general acceptance 
of discrimination on grounds of sex, race, and the like 
allows a conviction in the mind of the majority that the 
part of the population that is being discriminated against 
is indeed less worthy and cannot be considered bearers of 
the same human rights. Sooner or later, serious acts of 
violations of human rights will follow from such attitudes.
Single acts of discrimination cannot be considered vio￾lations of human rights because they do not produce a 
serious threat to the personhood of the victim. In the long 
run, however, acts of discrimination tend to create a threat 
to human rights. They must be banned in the interest of 
preventing conduct that may at some point lead to serious 
violations of human rights. Therefore, a state that is com￾mitted to the protection of human rights has the duty to 
act against discrimination through the means provided by 
370 Chapter 19 · The Principle of Equality
Risks for Human 
Rights19
positive law. Thus, laws prohibiting discrimination should 
not be seen as positivation of supra-positive human rights, 
but as a precautionary measure by positive law.
19.4 Is There a Human Right Against 
Discrimination on Reasons of Making 
Use of Human Rights?
There is still another variant of discrimination in the con￾text of human rights. It does not consist in a reduction or 
restriction of a particular human right but in the infiction 
of disadvantages because someone makes a special use of 
their human rights. Consider the following case.
A Catholic chief physician worked in a Catholic hospi￾tal. His employment contract read that: “Catholic employ￾ees are expected to recognize and observe the principles of 
Catholic doctrinal and moral teaching.” After his divorce, 
he remarried. This is against the Catholic doctrine. 
Consequently, the hospital carrier terminated the employ￾ment. The doctor brought legal action for protection 
against the dismissal. The ECJ and subsequently the 
German Federal Labor Court declared the dismissal 
unlawful, because it (1) violated Article 21 of the EU 
Charter of Fundamental Rights and (2) was also incom￾patible with an EU Directive prohibiting less favorable 
treatment of persons compared to others on reasons of 
religion.
The main argument of the judgements was that 
Catholic employees were discriminated against because 
their non-Catholic coworkers did not similarly face the 
risk of termination if they also remarried.
I have some doubts as to whether, in this case, discrim￾ination based on religion is in question. It seems more 
about the right to marry and to family life, but the chief 
physician was not prevented from remarrying. He should 
only have to accept the termination of his employment, 
but there is no human right to the post of a chief physi￾cian. The idea behind the prohibition of discrimination 
does not therefore refer to the impairment of human 
rights, but to the fact that someone who wants to exercise 
his human rights (here: the right to marry) in a certain way 
must pay a higher price for it. The idea behind the judge￾ment seems to be that the enjoyment of human rights 
should not be made more expensive for Catholics com￾371
19.4 · Is There a Human Right Against Discrimination…19
pared with non-Catholics. It is important that the price 
does not consist in the restriction of the human right itself 
but in a currency beyond the scope of human rights, i.e., 
the physician’s employment.
However, the question of whether the enjoyment of 
human rights may have a price is not a question that is 
answered by the human rights regime itself. Rather, the 
answer always lies in the system of the respective ordinary 
law, which is to be applied in this particular case. This is 
even confrmed by the EU directive that should apply in 
the chief physician case. In Article 4 of this directive 
(Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000) is 
provided that:
» a difference of treatment … shall not constitute discrimi￾nation where, by reason of the nature of the particular 
occupational activities concerned or of the context in 
which they are carried out, such a characteristic consti￾tutes a genuine and determining occupational require￾ment, ….
This provision shows that the enjoyment of human rights 
can in certain situations be connected with a certain price. 
On the one hand, it is not an occupational requirement for 
a physician not to marry a second time. On the other hand, 
it is an occupational requirement for a Catholic priest not 
to marry at all. If he wants to make use of his human right 
to marry he has to pay the price by quitting his job. For the 
functionary of a political party, it may be an occupational 
requirement not to express a political opinion that is 
incompatible with the political orientation of the party. 
For the employee of a tobacco factory, it can be an occu￾pational requirement not to engage in an anti-smoking 
campaign. All of them have to pay the price when making 
use of their human rights. Therefore, it cannot be said that 
under all circumstances you must treat people equally 
regardless of the way they exercise their human rights. 
There is no general ban of discrimination in this respect. 
Discrimination bans are rooted in the logic of the context 
in which they exist, not in human rights.
?Do You Still Remember?
1. What do Article 2 UDHR and Article 14 ECHR 
add to the list of human rights?

nothing to do with the principle of equality?

Conficts in the Field of Liberty and Human Rights
The German Federal Constitutional Court developed a 
doctrine whereby courts must strive to identify a so￾called “practical concordance” within all conceivable 
conficts of law (BVerfGE 28, 244 [261]; 35, 202 [225]). 
In contrast, philosophical analysis shows that the 
appropriate solution of conficts in the feld of liberty 
and human rights depends on which position in this 
feld is affected. There are three different positions:
1. the core area of human rights;
2. the margin area (“yard”) of human rights; and
3. the area of freedom of action.
Conficts in the Area of Freedom of Action
In a confict between the freedom of action of one per￾son and the freedom of action of another person, dif￾ferent ways of restriction are possible that make sure 
that the “choice of one can be united with the choice of 
another in accordance with the universal law of free￾dom” (Kant). Finding a practical concordance or alter￾natively engaging in a process of balancing is always 
possible. The restriction has to be justifed under the 
principle of proportionality (example: BVerfGE 80, 
137, “Riding in the woods”).
Conficts Between the Liberty Principle and the 
Margin Scope of a Human Right
Behavior that falls under the protection scope of the 
margin area of a codifed human right is to be regarded 
as having a higher rank than behavior that only falls 
under the protection scope of the principle of liberty. 
In such a confict, the former is to be privileged over the 
latter (example: BVerfGE 104, 337, “Ritual Slaugh￾ter”).
376 Chapter 20 · Rights in Conflict20
Conficts in the Area of the Margin Scopes of Human 
Rights
In the case of a confict between a behavior of person A 
that falls under the protection scope of the margin area 
of a codifed human right and a behavior of person B 
that also falls under the protection scope of the margin 
area of a codifed human right, the confict can only be 
resolved by looking for a practical concordance or, 
where this is not possible, to engage in a process of bal￾ancing. Neither conficting interest is to be given prefer￾ence over the other (e.g., right to privacy in public v. 
freedom of the press—BVerfGE 101, 361).
Conficts Between Freedom of Action and the Core 
Area of a Human Right
In conficts between freedom of action and the core 
area of a human right, the interest that is protected by 
the human right must always be preferred. There is no 
space for a process of balancing or for a practical con￾cordance (e.g. using fne dust emitting vehicles/right to 
life—BVerwGE 161, 201).
Conficts Between the Margin Area of a Human Right 
and the Core Area of a Human Right
In conficts between the margin area of a human right 
and the core area of a human right, the interest that is 
protected by the core area of a human right must 
always prevail. There is no space for a process of bal￾ancing or for a practical concordance (e.g., abortion 
cases—BVerfGE 88, 203).
377
Chapter 20 · Rights in Confict20
Conficts Between the Core Areas of Two Human 
Rights
Conficts between two interests when each of them is 
protected by the core area of a human right can very 
often be described as a confict between the moral duty 
to do something and the moral duty to refrain from 
doing something. In these cases, the confict can almost 
always be resolved by preferring the duty to refrain 
from doing activities that are contrary to the core con￾tent of a human right. This follows from the fact that 
the responsibility for actions weighs heavier than the 
responsibility for omissions. In the case of actions, we 
bear the responsibility not only for the immediate result 
of our action, but also for the further course of the 
world. In the case of an omission, we only bear the 
responsibility for the results of our direct behavior, but 
not for the further course of the world (e.g., terrorist 
attack by using an airplane with innocent passengers—
BVerfGE 115, 118).
Moral Dilemmas
It cannot be ignored that there are conficts between the 
core areas of different human rights that cannot be 
resolved by the distinction of action and omission. 
Only in these cases do we face an insolvable moral 
dilemma.
While legal dilemmas are supposed to be excluded 
from the legal system in principle, moral dilemmas can￾not be excluded from morality because morality is 
developed in an inductive manner while law is devel￾oped in a deductive manner.
A serious problem for the legal system arises if the 
entire morality of human rights is implemented in the 
legal system. The legal system can become incomplete 
where the morality of human rights embraces moral 
dilemmas.
378 Chapter 20 · Rights in Conflict20
20.1 Methods for Resolving Norm Conficts
Now that there is greater clarity on human rights on the 
one hand and on the principles of liberty and equality on 
the other, I would like to address the problem of norm 
conficts in this fnal chapter. The solution of such con￾ficts depends on whether we must consider the right or the 
normative position in question as an absolute position or 
as a relative position.
During the course of this book, we have distinguished 
between three different positions (see . Fig. 20.1):
1. the core area of human rights;
2. the margin area (“yard”) of human rights; and
3. the area of freedom of action.
In case law, it is unfortunately not typical to distinguish 
between these three areas. Therefore, it is very often not 
clear which criteria the courts use to solve normative con￾ficts.
The German Federal Constitutional Court only devel￾oped a very vague theory whereby courts must strive to 
identify a so-called “practical concordance” within all 
conceivable conficts of law. This expression was frst 
introduced in case law in two judgments of the Court of 
1970 and 1973.
Regardless of whether the confict only implicates free￾dom of action or the margin or even the core of a human 
right, according to this doctrine the court must look for a 
compromise (fair balance) that allows the parties to realize 
their conficting rights to optimal levels. Only in cases 
where such a compromise seems be impossible should the

379
20.1 · Methods for Resolving Norm Conficts20 court move to a process of balancing. The criteria of this 
process, and particular the question of the relative weight 
of each of the conficting rights, remains open. The 
ECtHR has not yet adopted this doctrine. So far as I can 
see, it has been mentioned only once in a dissenting opin￾ion of 2007 by ad hoc judge Heinz Schäffer from Austria. 
By clearly distinguishing between the three areas, confict 
decisions become much more transparent and comprehen￾sible.
20.2 Freedom of Action v. Freedom of Action
The frst variant of a norm confict is a confict between 
the freedoms of action of two different persons. According 
to the famous teachings of Immanuel Kant, the freedom 
of action of any person is limited by the freedom of action 
of another person (see . Fig. 20.2):
» Law is the sum of the conditions under which the choice 
of one can be united with the choice of another in accor￾dance with a universal law of freedom.
This principle, however, does not solve any particular con￾ficts because the same principle must be applied to the 
freedom of each person. Since the limits of the freedom of 
the latter is not determined it is not possible to determine 
the limits of the freedom of the former.
Therefore, we need an authoritative decision. This is 
the task of the legislator and, in conficts which are not 
regulated by statute, it must be the task of the judge. There 
. Fig. 20.2 Freedom of action v. freedom of action
380 Chapter 20 · Rights in Conflict20
is no fundamental diffculty because freedom of action is 
only protected by the principle of liberty. There is no abso￾lute protection scope in this area.
A classical case that fell in this area was the so-called 
“Riding in the Woods” case of the BVerfG of 1989. Due 
to a law from 1980, riding in the woods was only permitted 
on paths designated by signposts as equestrian trails. The 
applicant raised a constitutional complaint on the ground 
that this legislation restricted his freedom of action with￾out any justifcation. Riding in the forest did not violate 
the rights of others, did not damage the forest, and did not 
violate the constitutional order. The Court decided that 
prohibiting riding in the woods outside of the designated 
trails was in accordance with the Constitution. The basis 
of this decision came from a generalized and abstract stat￾ute which served a legitimate aim, namely avoiding the 
harm resulting from potential encounters between pedes￾trians and horses as well as the harm resulting from the 
loosening of the forest foor that is connected with riding. 
It is a typical regulation that unites the choice of one with 
the choice of another in accordance with the principle of 
liberty. The rule was further considered to be suitable, nec￾essary, and adequate.
20.3 Margin Human Right v. Freedom 
of Action
Another variant of conficts of that kind refers to a con￾fict between the freedom of action of two persons, either. 
The difference to the frst case is only that the interest of 
person A falls in the marginal protection scope of a codi￾fed human right while the interest of person B does not 
fall in the protection scope of a human right but only in 
the feld of the liberty principle (see . Fig. 20.3). Although 
the margin scope of a human right only refers to freedom 
of action, we can say that activities that are cached by the 
margin protection scope of a codifed human right or a 
fundamental constitutional right in general deserve an 
extraordinary and outstanding appreciation under posi￾tive law. Therefore, we have good arguments in favor of 
the determination that in such a confict the interest within 
the margin protection scope should be favored.
A good example for such a confict is the “Ritual 
Slaughter” case of the BVerfG of 2002. The confict in this 
“Riding in the Woods”
Ritual Slaughter
381
20.3 · Margin Human Right v. Freedom of Action20
. Fig. 20.3 Freedom of action v. margin of HR
case, however, was not a confict between two private inter￾ests, but a confict between the private interest of a Muslim 
butcher in producing meat, which was recognized as halāl 
by the Muslim community, and the public interest in ani￾mal protection against cruel methods of slaughtering. The 
Act Concerning the Protection of Animals prohibited the 
slaughter of animals without numbing. The Act neverthe￾less granted an exception where it is necessary to meet the 
needs of members of certain religious communities that 
prescribe slaughter without numbing or prohibit the con￾sumption of meat of animals that have been slaughtered 
with numbing. The applicant, a Muslim butcher, wanted 
to receive such a special permit. The BVerfG came to the 
result that the interest of the butcher was only protected 
by the liberty principle (Article 2 (1) GG) and not by the 
right to freedom of religion (Article 4 (1) GG), but that 
the freedom to slaughter was in this case somehow infu￾enced by the right to religion, thus giving it a relative 
higher weight than the public interest in animal protec￾tion. The freedom to slaughter was, so to say, charged with 
more power because there was a certain connection to the 
right to freedom of religion. At that time, animal protec￾tion did not yet enjoy constitutional status. Importantly, 
the court could not fnd that the core of the right to free￾dom of religion had been infringed.
382 Chapter 20 · Rights in Conflict20
20.4 Margin Human Right v. Margin Human 
Right
The graphic below (see . Fig.  20.4) shows the confict 
between the margin of a human right and the margin of 
another human right. In such a case, we cannot say that 
one of the conficting interests prevails over the other 
because both are charged with the same extraordinary 
weight. So, it is necessary to deal with this confict in the 
same way as with conficts between interests which are 
covered only by the principle of liberty without any value￾based charging. Compromises and balancing are not 
problematic because interests that fall within the margin 
scope of a human right are not protected in the absolute. 
Although they are privileged by positive law, there is no 
moral need to privilege them.
Typical cases include those that refer to the confict 
between reputation and the freedom of classical media 
where the incriminating message that is the subject of the 
litigation is true. The freedom of the media belongs to the 
scope of the freedom of free speech, but it does not fall in 
the core of this right because the human right to freedom 
of speech does not protect privileged opportunities to 
receive attention—which the media clearly enjoys. Still, 
the interest in maintaining a good public reputation by 
hiding the constituent conditions of the reputation falls 
within the scope of the right to privacy, but not within the 
. Fig. 20.4 Margin of HR v. margin of HR
“Princess of Monaco”
383
20.4 · Margin Human Right v. Margin Human Right20 core of that right. So, it is possible to balance the confict￾ing interests. Is information about the person concerned 
relevant to develop a public opinion about important 
questions of political, economic, or cultural life, or is the 
interest in the information solely based on pure curiosity? 
An example of this situation appears in the case of 
“Caroline of Monaco” of the BVerfG of 1999.
Another case of this type is the following: In 1982, the 
complainant was convicted of murder and sentenced to 
life. The magazine DER SPIEGEL ran articles on the case 
in its print edition, which identifed the complainant by 
name. Seventeen years later, the publisher uploaded the 
articles to the magazine’s online archive, where the articles 
were accessible for free and without restrictions. When the 
complainant’s name was entered into one of the common 
Internet search engines, the articles in question were listed 
among the top search results. In 2002, the complainant 
was released from prison. In 2013, the complainant lodged 
a constitutional complaint seeking to enjoin the magazine 
from disseminating any information on the criminal case 
containing his last name. He claimed a violation of his 
human rights and argued that the online articles associ￾ated him with his past crime and thus interfered and bur￾dened his present desire to cultivate social relationships. 
The complainant did not contest that the murder trial 
from 30 years ago constitutes a signifcant event of con￾temporary history; he argued, however, that the public 
does not have a continued interest in his name tied to the 
conviction of 30 years ago. In its “Right to be forgotten I” 
judgment of 2019, the Court held the opinion that two 
fundamental rights are in confict here and that therefore a 
balancing is required. From our considerations in 
7 Chaps. 10 and 11 it is clear that the cores of human 
rights were not involved here. The “right to be forgotten” 
refers to confdentiality. The information about the crimi￾nal past of the complainant should be hidden to avoid his 
exclusion from social ties. The right to free speech is not 
infringed by rules concerning the protection of confdenti￾ality. Confdentiality, on the other hand, is not a matter of 
the right to privacy, because the fact that is supposed to be 
hidden does not refer to private life on the backstage. It 
should be considered whether it is an aspect of an unwrit￾ten right to affliation as a full member of society. I have 
some doubts whether the right to affliation in general and 
the right to be forgotten in particular can be considered as 
human rights. In any case, the complainant’s interest falls 
Right to be Forgotten
384 Chapter 20 · Rights in Conflict20
only in the margin of such a right and not in the core. 
Accordingly, a confict exists only between the margin of 
the right to free speech and the margin of the right to affl￾iation. Dissolving this confict is a matter of balancing or 
fnding practical concordance and not a matter of abso￾lute rights.
20.5 Freedom of Action v. Core Human Right
The graphic below (see . Fig.  20.5) shows the confict 
between freedom of action on the one side and the core of 
a human right—i.e., the freedom of will—on the other. 
There is no doubt that the interest that falls within the core 
of the protection scope of the human right must prevail. 
Accordingly, there is no basis for any process of assess￾ment or balancing because the protection scope of the 
human right is absolute while freedom of action only 
enjoys relative protections.
Consider the following example. Fine dust contains 
particles of different sizes that endanger health. 
Nevertheless, diesel soot contains ultra-fne dust particles 
that can penetrate deep into the lungs or even into the 
bloodstream. Fine dust exposure can lead to heart, circu￾latory, and respiratory diseases as well as cancer. It can 
even enhance allergies. Elderly people and children are 
. Fig. 20.5 Freedom of action v. core of HR
“Diesel Soot” Case
385
20.5 · Freedom of Action v. Core Human Right20 particularly vulnerable. The dramatic effect of fne dust 
particles has been known for a long time. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) estimates that of two million 
annual deaths worldwide caused by fne dust exposure, 
more than 300,000 die in Europe alone. Statistics further 
indicate that about 75,000 people in Germany die every 
year because of their exposure to soot particles that are 
emitted by diesel motors. Driving a diesel vehicle is a real￾ization of freedom of action. Killing people by driving a 
diesel vehicle is a violation of the right to life. So, there is 
a confict between freedom of action on the one side and 
the right to life on the other. In this confict, there is no 
basis for engaging in any process of assessment or balanc￾ing. The right to life dominates and the ban of diesel vehi￾cles, particularly in areas where people are living, is well 
justifed. The BVerwG addressed this issue in 2018. 
Nevertheless, in reaching its decision, the Court only grap￾pled with the interpretation and application of the rele￾vant emission control law and not with any of the 
implicated human rights, much less the question of how 
conficts between human rights and the principle of liberty 
should be resolved. But we should keep in mind that 
behind the regular administrative law stands exactly this 
question.
20.6 Margin Human Right v. Core Human 
Right
The solution in the case of a confict between the core of a 
human right and the margin of a human right is exactly 
the same (see . Fig. 20.6). Of course, the interest that is 
protected by the core protection scope must prevail. This 
principle has been disregarded in the abortion cases. In 
these cases, there is a confict between the life of the 
unborn child (fetus) on the one hand and the mother’s 
interest in not carrying the pregnancy to term and not 
exposing herself to the stress of childbirth. Since there is 
no human right to freedom from pregnancy, the mother’s 
interest actually falls only within the scope of protection 
of general freedom of action. The U.S. Supreme Court, on 
the other hand, in Roe v. Wade (1973), assumed that the 
right to privacy argued for the mother. In my opinion, this 
can at most be considered in the case of pregnancy after 
rape. But the question can be left open. For in any case, the 
Abortion
386 Chapter 20 · Rights in Conflict20
. Fig. 20.6 Margin of HR v. core of HR
interest in not carrying a pregnancy to term and avoiding 
childbirth does not fall within the core area, but only 
within the marginal area of the right to private life. There 
can therefore be no doubt that the interest behind the right 
to life must prevail, because killing against or without the 
will of the person killed always affects the core area of the 
right to life.
Some proponents of the legitimacy of abortion, how￾ever, dispute that the right to life can be violated by killing 
a human embryo or fetus as long as the fetus has not yet 
reached a certain stage of development. This argument 
relates directly to the question of whether human beings 
can be considered persons when they have not yet devel￾oped the capacity for personhood and can therefore only 
be considered potential persons or proto-persons. As I 
tried to show in 7 Chap. 14, there is no relevant difference 
between potential persons and fully developed persons 
that could justify excluding human fetuses from the scope 
of protection of the right to life.
387
20.6 · Margin Human Right v. Core Human Right20 The U.S. Supreme Court was nevertheless able to rule 
in favor of the mother’s privacy because it ignored the 
conficting right to life of the unborn without comment. 
Thus, there was no confict between competing rights for 
the Court to decide. The U.S. Supreme Court “overruled” 
the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022. In Dobbs v Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization, it held that the right to pri￾vacy does not include the freedom to dispose of the life of 
the unborn. But even in that decision, the U.S. Supreme 
Court did not recognize a human right to life of the 
unborn. It merely stated that the right to privacy and the 
general freedom of action does not result in a right to 
abortion guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, 
states are free to decide whether and under what condi￾tions to permit or prohibit abortion. In the view of U.S. 
jurisprudence, therefore, the life of the unborn human 
being is still not protected by a human right but the sub￾ject of a political decision by state level legislature.
The BVerfG of Germany was different. In its 1993 
decision, the court took note of the confict and made the 
correct assessment by declaring abortion generally unlaw￾ful. However, it rightly concluded that this did not yet 
imply a duty on the part of the state to prosecute abortion. 
This is because the answer to the question of whether, to 
what extent, and by what means the state must provide 
protection against human rights violations by third parties 
depends, as we have seen, on political considerations. The 
human rights duty to protect, unlike the human rights 
duty to respect, is not absolute. Therefore, it is defendable 
that the BVerfG came to the conclusion that the state can￾not be reproached under human rights law if it refrains 
from prosecution in the case that the pregnant woman frst 
seeks pregnancy counseling. However, this ruling is 
implausible insofar as the Court also considered it permis￾sible to have the costs of the abortion fnanced by the pub￾lic social security system and to impose on the employer 
the obligation to release the pregnant woman from work 
for the purpose of the abortion. In this respect, the state 
clearly violates its duty of respect because it actively con￾tributes to abortion.

20.7 Core Human Right v. Core Human Right
The . Fig.  20.7 shows the hard case of the confict 
between the core of a human right of person A and the 
core of a human right of person B. Each side claims abso￾lute protection. Neither is reducible. An assessment or bal￾ancing procedure is therefore not possible. How should we 
deal with such a confict?
First, we must distinguish between two kinds of cases. 
The frst kind of cases is epitomized by the fact that the 
obligor either stands in front of the duty to refrain from 
doing something or the duty to do something. The second 
kind of cases relates to a situation where the obligor must 
either do something in favor of person A or do something 
in favor of person B. Accordingly, I want to begin by dis￾cussing the frst variant.
. Fig. 20.7 Core of HR v. core of HR
389
20.7 · Core Human Right v. Core Human Right20 I will give you an example from German case law. The 
BVerfG had to rule on the constitutionality of a statute 
that authorized the Minister of Defense to give the com￾mand to shoot down an airplane if there is some evidence 
that the plane has been commandeered by terrorists and 
will be used as a bomb in order to kill a large number of 
people (“9/11 scenario”). The statute was essentially based 
on the Utilitarian idea that in such a situation the life and 
happiness of the passengers of the plane have less weight 
than the life and happiness of the people that form the 
targets on Earth because the latter group is larger than the 
former group. The BVerfG (2006) voided the law by argu￾ing that human dignity does not allow an assessment of 
the value life in terms of quantity. The life of the passen￾gers would be of the same value as the life of the people on 
Earth. Regardless of the reason, it is impermissible to kill 
even a single person. For their right to life is absolute and 
never up for disposal. It is obvious that this argumentation 
is not complete. The fact that both the value of the pas￾sengers on board and the value of the people on Earth are 
identical does not provide a hint as to how the confict 
should be decided. We get a hint only if we recognize that 
the confict consists of the confict between the duty to 
refrain from killing the passengers and the duty to do 
something, namely to rescue the people on Earth by kill￾ing the passengers.
In most cases, there are very good arguments in favor 
of the opinion that our moral responsibility concerning 
our affrmative actions is relatively higher than the moral 
responsibility concerning our omissions. Refraining from 
doing something only amounts to not disturbing the 
course of the world. We do not shape what happens and 
we do not take responsibility for the course of the world. 
If we do something, we initiate or steer the course of the 
world. By doing so, we become responsible for the course 
of the world. This is risky if our control over the conse￾quences of our actions is incomplete and full of gaps. In 
this case, we assume a responsibility that we cannot actu￾ally bear. There is still another argument in favor of the 
duty to refrain from doing something. The moral duty to 
do something always refers to a duty to support or to res￾cue someone else. To help or to rescue someone else is of 
course a moral merit. But an obligation to help or to res￾cue can only refer to the application of means which are in 
accordance with morality. We cannot be morally obliged 
Doing v. Omitting
390 Chapter 20 · Rights in Conflict20
to support someone else if the support is only possible by 
immoral means.
However, there are cases in which the decision princi￾ple of “non-action is better than action” does not lead to 
a convincing result. These are the cases of self-defense and 
emergency assistance. In these cases, the law allows repel￾ling of an unlawful attack, even if this results in the loss of 
the attacker’s goods, which are also legally protected. (cf. § 
32 German Penal Code). Here, we are interested in cases 
in which the defense, in order to be successful, must neces￾sarily consist of injuring the aggressor on goods that are 
protected under human rights law. Does the absolute value 
of these goods not dictate that self-defense be dispensed 
with and that damage to one’s own legal rights be accepted 
instead?
Such an obligation to tolerate will indeed have to be 
assumed if the goods to be defended do not themselves 
have a human rights status but can nevertheless only be 
protected by violating the attacker’s human rights-related 
goods. It can therefore not be morally justifed to repel an 
attack on property that is not necessary for survival by 
killing the attacker. But what about if the attacker himself 
seeks the life of his victim? In this case we have a confict 
between human rights core and human rights core. In such 
a case, doesn’t the attacked person have to sacrifce their 
life rather than kill the attacker? The rule of priority of 
omission over action would dictate this.
In a self-defense situation of this kind, a person is 
faced with the alternative of either respecting the human 
rights of the aggressor at the price of giving up their own 
or protecting their own by violating or destroying those of 
the aggressor. Those who choose the frst alternative 
thereby forego the conditions of the possibility of leading 
a life of human dignity themselves. For such a life is pos￾sible only on condition that the goods protected by human 
rights are available. Thus, whoever respects the human 
rights of the aggressor in a self-defense situation, at the 
same time disregards their own human rights and thus 
renounces their own self-determination. This, however, is 
not required by human rights because they do not weigh 
the legal rights of others higher than one’s own. Just as 
human rights cannot be violated by someone failing to 
help others in existential need, they are not violated by 
someone defending their own human-rights-protected 
goods at the price of violating the goods of the aggressor. 
Self Defense
391
20.7 · Core Human Right v. Core Human Right20 In both cases, what is at stake is the preservation of the 
agent’s conditions of life worthy of human dignity. The 
same arguments that lead to the conclusion that no gen￾eral human rights obligations to help can be derived from 
human dignity (cf. Chap. 15.6) thus also justify self￾defense. This idea must also be made fruitful for the prob￾lem of the fnal rescue shot.
Now, I want to add some remarks about the second 
variant of cases. These cases are epitomized by the fact 
that there is no choice between doing and refraining from 
doing something. Indeed, these cases only concern the 
duty to do something. Take the following example. 
Unborn twins are connected to each other in the uterus of 
the mother. Both will die if they are not separated. The 
doctor can carry out the necessary operation, but it will 
cause one of the children to die. The doctor is faced with 
the question of which one to rescue and which one to kill. 
In this case, it is beyond any doubt that the doctor is 
obliged to do something, namely to rescue at least one of 
the children. This is better than doing nothing. But they 
must decide which child to rescue and which to kill. Does 
human rights law give an answer as to what should be 
done? If we concede that both children hold the right to 
life, we face a serious dilemma. The possible existence of 
such dilemmas put into question very important elements 
of the classical legal theory.
Most legal theorists agree that a legal order must be 
free from conficts that cannot be resolved though legal 
means (Dworkin, Alexy; see 7 Chap. 18). If there are two 
contradicting claims and each of them are legitimated by 
a legal rule, there must be another legal rule according to 
which the confict can be decided. I think that this doctrine 
of the completeness of the legal order can only be main￾tained if human rights fgure out of consideration. In for￾mer times, legal regulations could always be characterized 
by moral principles. In the case of a confict, however, the 
law always had the last word. The law could defer moral 
demands so that the unity, completeness, and consistency 
of the legal system could be maintained. Nevertheless, this 
is no longer possible if we introduce the rule of human 
rights into the corpus of the legal order. In order to under￾stand the problem, we must consider the different charac￾teristics of law and morality (see . Fig. 20.8).
The modern legal system starts with general and 
abstract rules, which are laid down in the constitution. 
Moral Dilemmas
Completeness of Law
392 Chapter 20 · Rights in Conflict20
. Fig. 20.8 Induction of morals/deduction of law. (Created by author, © crowd: 
Sophie Reinisch; © Man Icon: Sophie Reinisch)
Authorized institutions like the parliament, the judiciary, 
or administrative bodies have the task of concretizing the 
corpus of all the single detailed rules and regulations into 
a coherent legal system. So, we can say that the legal sys￾tem is developed in a deductive manner. In other words, it 
is based on an intellectual construction that aims to ensure 
that the system includes a legal answer to every possible 
future legal confict. This is necessary because in the case 
of conficts, parties are supposed to call a court, which 
then has to decide the case. The court, however, can only 
decide in favor of one party or the other. But the court 
cannot avoid giving an answer, because this would be the 
end of the monopoly of power and the end of social peace. 
Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the proper func￾tionality of the legal order that it involve confict rules for 
any kind of confict. Modern legal systems are supposed 
to be complete in this sense. Legal dilemmas have to be 
excluded.
393
20.7 · Core Human Right v. Core Human Right20 Nevertheless, as we have seen before, human rights are 
primarily moral rights. As codifed rights, they are moral 
rights that are transferred to legal rights. It is well known 
among the philosophers who deal with the philosophical 
analysis of morality that moral systems can be and mostly 
are incomplete (Williams). They can have serious defcien￾cies. In the face of such a defciency, morality does not 
teach us what we should do in a given situation. In situa￾tions of that kind, we are faced with a moral dilemma. So, 
according to legal theory, legal dilemmas do not exist 
because the legal system is always complete and consis￾tent. According to the theory of morality, moral dilemmas 
exist because the moral system is always incomplete and 
sometimes inconsistent. What is the reason for this differ￾ence?
Moral rules are not issued by an almighty and omni￾scient divine instance or by a parliament who can pre￾scribe the appropriate behavior for all future situations 
and confict. Instead, moral rules are incrementally devel￾oped over a long period of time, one case at a time. It is a 
similar to the development of case law in the English 
Common Law system. Moral systems are not constructed 
from the top to the bottom—that is, from general princi￾ples to detailed rules and recommendations. Indeed, the 
opposite is true. The moral system initially consists of 
detailed and particular rules and recommendations that 
have been proven in the practice of human life. For the 
purpose of transmitting these moral experiences and 
knowledge from one generation to the next, it is useful to 
extract more abstract and generalized rules from these 
materials in order to make it easier to teach and learn. 
Thus, morality moves from the particular to the more 
generalized and abstract. This process ultimately leads to 
highly sophisticated and very general and abstract moral 
rules, as is evidenced by Kant’s Categorical Imperative, the 
Golden Rule, or the principle of human dignity. 
Considering that morality is developed in an inductive 
manner, it is possible that there are situations in life for 
which the given set of moral rules does not provide an 
answer as to what should be done. In such a situation, we 
speak of moral dilemmas.
So, we recognize that the idea of the completeness of a 
modern legal system can perhaps no longer be maintained 
when it comes to the fusion of an entire moral system with 
the legal system and if the moral system is considered as 
having a guiding role. This is exactly what happens when 
Incompleteness of 
Morality
394 Chapter 20 · Rights in Conflict20
the entirety of moral human rights is transmitted into the 
corpus of positive law through codifcation.
One of the most relevant consequences of this trans￾mission is that the legal order has to face moral dilemmas 
which become legal dilemmas that cannot be solved by 
legal instruments. If we are faced with a confict between 
interests that are both protected by the core protection 
scope of human rights, it is conceivable that it is not pos￾sible to fnd a legal solution to the problem. Whatever we 
do will always be contrary to the value of human dignity. 
Whatever we do will always be unlawful.
One way of responding legally to such dilemmas was 
demonstrated by the Landgericht (District Court) 
Frankfurt in the Daschner case. It interpreted this case as 
a confict between the core areas of two human rights, 
namely a confict between the right to life and the prohibi￾tion of torture. A perpetrator had kidnapped the young 
son of a banker. In the course of the police investigation, 
he was arrested. He admitted to the kidnapping, but was 
unwilling to name the place where he was holding the boy. 
Fearing for the boy’s life, Deputy Police Commissioner 
Daschner threatened the perpetrator with torture in order 
to fnd out where the victim was being held. The latter 
eventually revealed the location. When the police arrived 
there, however, they found that the boy had already died 
some time before Daschner’s threat of torture.
Daschner was accused and the Landgericht Frankfurt 
sentenced him to probation and charged him with a fne of 
10,800 EURO. The Court recognized that the ban on tor￾ture is absolute and that there is no justifcation to ever 
torture another, even if it is considered necessary to save 
the life of an innocent child. (In fact, there was nothing to 
save because the boy was already dead.) Nevertheless, the 
Court also had a certain sympathy for Daschner’s behav￾ior. (Comparatively, a judgement of the Supreme Court of 
Israel of 1999 showed much less sympathy for torture 
despite the Israel Security authorities’ attempt to justify it 
in situations involving signifcantly more extreme threats 
to life and limb to the people of Israel.) The Court, there￾fore, imposed an extremely low punishment that was actu￾ally seen as only having symbolic value. In the eyes of the 
Court, the case involved a moral dilemma that could only 
be answered by a kind of symbolism and not by a serious 
answer from penal law. I think there was no need to con￾sider this case as a moral dilemma because the confict can 
be resolved on the basis of the different moral responsibil￾Legal Dilemmas?
395
20.7 · Core Human Right v. Core Human Right20 ity between actions and omissions. But this is another 
question. Here, I want to only focus on the solution that 
the Court found for a case that was considered a moral 
dilemma. And the answer was: we can only react to moral 
dilemmas in a symbolic way. This solution can, of course, 
be contested and should be made a matter of further dis￾course.
The end of this chapter, and thus the end of this entire 
textbook, confronts us with questions instead of answers. 
Nevertheless, I think this is appropriate for a philosophi￾cal book. Philosophy teaches us to ask the right questions. 
It does not guarantee that we will reach satisfactory 
answers. Therefore, philosophy is a never-ending inquiry.

6.2 Yes. According to the results of baby research and 
developmental psychology, babies have a sense for 
personhood by nature, so that they can scan their 
environment for personhood and fx their attention 
if they recognize something in their environment as

6.3 Yes. There is some evidence for this hypothesis. 
Someone who ignores and disregards the person￾hood of others will feel shame. Shame implies a 
tendency for suicide. Alternatively, the person can 
avoid the feeling of shame by replacing it with the 
feeling of guilt. The feeling of guilt is connected to 
severe feelings of psychical pain and regret. The 
person can also avoid feeling either shame or guilt 
by replacing both feelings with neurotic symptoms. 
Neurosis consists in a kind of psychical displace￾ment. It is “the method of avoiding non-being by 
avoiding being.”
6.4 In order to distinguish between persons “with dig￾nity” and persons “without dignity,” you must use a

10.2 The protection scopes of many codifed human 
rights go beyond what can be derived from the 
principle of human dignity. In these cases, it 
makes sense to distinguish between the “core” of a 
human right—this is the protection scope that 
refers to the protection of personhood—and the 
“yard” or margin of the right, which refers to free￾dom of action. Rights concerning the “yard” can 
be restricted within the frame of the codifed 
restriction clauses. Rights concerning the “core” 
are absolute and may not be restricted.
10.3 The communication rights do not protect privi￾leged positions for the spreading one’s own opin￾ions and convictions. The teacher can make use of 
their rights by spreading their opinions and con￾victions outside the school.
10.4 The performative contradiction is a contradiction 
between a proposition and the speech act by which 
the proposition is expressed. Example: P asserts 
that all assertions are false.

vAnswers to Chapter 11
11.1 The core function of the privacy rights is defend￾ing freedom of will against self-alienation by fxa￾tion on role-identities. The privacy rights refer to 
the protection of an authentic will-making pro￾cess by ensuring a sphere of life in which persons 
are not forced to display a role-identity because 
this sphere is hidden from public control.
11.2 A person who is forced to get married is deprived 
of the opportunity of establishing an intimate 
relationship with a sexual partner while also being 
forced to live with a partner with whom there is no 
intimate relationship, such that the person con￾cerned is permanently forced to perform a role￾identity in front of the spouse.
11.3 Social relationships of a person to other members 
of the society outside the walls of hidden intimate 
relations always establish a position that forces the 
person to display a role-identity. Privacy refers to 
a sphere of living in which it is not necessary to 
play a role-identity but to behave as one really is.
11.4 The human rights are as such a moral standard. 
There is no morality that can restrict them.
vAnswers to Chapter 12
12.1 In the context of the Peace of Westphalia (1648).
12.2 Conscience is (1) the knowledge of the standards 
of morality and (2) the conviction to be bound to 
them.
12.3 The core function of the right to freedom of con￾science is defending the freedom of will against a 
feeling of moral shame from which the respective 
person can only escape by suicide or neurotic self￾alienation.
12.4 The right to freedom of conscience can be consid￾ered a human right because the coercion to com￾mit actions which the agent considers evil leads to 
the agent’s fxation on a personality that they can￾not accept. This leads to a state of self-negation 
which includes the drive to self-destruction. These 
tendencies affect not only personality, but also 
personhood.
vAnswers to Chapter 13
13.1 The core function of the right to freedom of reli￾gion is the protection of access to the religious 
405
Do You Still Remember: The Answers21
means of resilience against uncontrollable nega￾tive life experiences (senseless suffering, senseless 
injustice, the expectation of one’s own death).
13.2 Religion is the entirety of all techniques that allow 
a person to maintain the capacity of authentic 
self-determination and to avoid self-alienation in 
situations of senseless suffering, senseless injus￾tice, or the expectation of the own death.
13.3 The religious dualism refers to the fact that reli￾gious persons share two different worldviews: (1) 
the profane view and (2) the sacral view. The pro￾fane view shows the world as a system of different 
parts that can be analyzed. The sacral view shows 
the world as a whole.
13.4 The freedom to believe, to express or share religious 
beliefs, to organize or to attend religious assembles, 
and to build or join religious associations is already 
protected by the communication rights. The freedom 
not to be forced to cooperate contrary to one’s own 
religiously infuenced conscience is already protected 
by the general right to freedom of conscience.
vAnswers to Chapter 14
14.1 It is not possible to harm a person by killing them. 
For before the act of killing is committed, the per￾son is still alive and not harmed in terms of life. 
When the act of killing has already been commit￾ted, there is nobody who could suffer from the 
deprivation of life. For the person that has been 
killed does not exist anymore. They cannot be in 
an inhuman state of living.
14.2 The function of the right to life is not to protect 
persons against being brought to an inhuman 
state of living by an act of killing. Instead, the 
function is to protect all members of society from 
a general devaluation of their own existence. The 
existence of every person may not stand under the 
conditions of social or private preferences of oth￾ers when the consciousness of the absolute value 
of one’s own existence as a person is ensured.
14.3 The death penalty cannot be justifed because it 
disrespects the absolute value of personhood.
14.4 Assisted suicide or acts of killing on demand gen￾erally do not violate the right to life because they 
are committed in accordance with the will of the 
person who wants to die.

vAnswers to Chapter 15
15.1 They depend on the existence of related social 
institutions. The establishing of such social insti￾tutions depends on the resources and political 
decisions related to the allocation of fnancial 
means.
15.2 According to the protestant ethics of capitalism 
(Max Weber), labor is considered a value as such 
(intrinsic value). But it is only a means of life. 
Under favorable conditions it is possible to lead a 
decent life without working. It is only crucial that 
a person earns a suffcient income.
15.3 Duties to refrain from doing something only 
demand doing nothing. To do nothing does not 
require a large amount of effort. In most cases, it 
requires no effort at all. In contrast, duties to do 
something require a stepwise increasing number 
of efforts. The efforts can come in confict with the 
sphere of autonomy that is required to lead a life 
based on an own free will.
15.4 Yes. If social institutions that are dedicated to the 
purpose of ensuring dignifed living conditions 
exist, then excluding from these institutions those 
persons that are in need can be considered inhu￾man or degrading treatment or perhaps a viola￾tion of one of the other classical human rights.
vAnswers to Chapter 16
16.1 No. There is no codifed human right to asylum. 
International asylum law is primarily codifed in 
the Geneva Refugee Convention of 1951. This 
Convention does not contain a substantive right 
to asylum.
16.2 The refoulement ban refers to the prohibition of 
deporting an alien to a country where they have to 
face a serious deprivation of goods which are pro￾tected by human rights. The refoulement ban is an 
integral part of every human right.
16.3 No. There is no moral human right for refugees 
who stay inside a potential host country because 
refugees in the inland are suffciently protected by 
the refoulement ban.
16.4 No. There is no moral human right for refugees 
who stay outside the borders of the potential host 
state. The decision on whether to help these refu￾407
Do You Still Remember: The Answers21
gees in particular (rather than others) and on the 
extent of the help is at the discretion of the poten￾tial host states.
vAnswers to Chapter 17
17.1 Property is a pure juridical notion. It denotes a 
bundle of rights and duties that someone has in 
relation to certain material or ideal items.
17.2 No, it is a pure juridical construction based on 
positive law. The positive law defnes (1) the scope 
of objects to which property rights can be 
assigned, (2) the subjects who can hold property 
rights, (3) how property rights can be acquired, 
and (4) the rights and duties, which defne the con￾tent of the property rights.
17.3 The argumentation of John Locke suffers from a 
quaternio terminorum fallacy. While a regular syl￾logism operates with three concepts, in the case of 
a quaternio terminorum, it operates with 4 con￾cepts. Nevertheless, this remains hidden because 
two of these concepts share the same expression.
17.4 First generation: liberal rights, second generation: 
social rights, third generation: collective rights. 
Collective rights are rights where the holders of 
the right are not human individuals but human 
collectives. Collectives can never be a holder of 
human rights because they are not persons.
vAnswers to Chapter 18
18.1 The classical defnition of the principle of liberty 
is given in Article 4 of the French Declaration of 
the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789.
18.2 The principle refers to freedom of action, not to 
freedom of will.
18.3 Rules are strict norms. According to a rule, par￾ticular factual circumstances give way to concrete 
legal consequences. Conficts between rules lead 
to the invalidity of the conficting rules unless 
there is another rule which decides which of the 
conficting rules should prevail. Comparatively, 
principles only present particular interests that are 
to be taken into consideration if it comes to a con￾fict with other interests. Conficts between differ￾ent interests that are protected by the principle of 
liberty are to be resolved by seeking a compro￾mise.
408 Chapter 21 · Do You Still Remember: The Answers21
18.4 No, it does not make sense to call the principle of 
liberty part of supra-positive law. The principle is 
an element of the rule of law and valid only in the 
frame of a given positive legal order.
vAnswers to Chapter 19
19.1 They add nothing but repeat only what already is 
written in each of the particular human rights, 
namely that “everybody has the right to …” or 
“No one shall be treated …”.
19.2 The expression “equal” in “equal human rights” 
refers to the generality of human rights. Every 
human person is a bearer of human rights because 
they are a person and not because they have to be 
treated equally to other persons.
19.3 The principle of equality refers to the fair sharing 
of burdens and benefts of cooperation. It is only 
to be applied in cases of distribution of the results 
of cooperation among the participants of the 
respective cooperating community.
19.4 No, there is no such right because human rights 
protect against a damage to personhood and not 
against pure insult. Nevertheless, a social atmo￾sphere where it is generally accepted to discrimi￾nate against people on grounds of sex, “race,” and 
the like leads to the weakening of the ability to 
maintain one’s own personhood. It also leads to a 
social climate in which it becomes more and more 
likely that human rights will be violated. Therefore, 
the state has the duty to ban acts of discrimina￾tion in order to avoid such a risky climate.
vAnswers to Chapter 20
20.1 In the case of a confict between two or more com￾peting claims, the practical concordance approach 
demands seeking a compromise by which the con￾ficting interests have been optimally satisfed.
20.2 Claims on the level of the liberty principle and on 
the level of the yard of human rights are always 
relative rights. Their function is to optimize the 
range of the freedom of action. Therefore, it is 
possible to restrict this range for the sake of a 
compromise.
20.3 If the confict offers the choice between refraining 
from harming someone by leaving others without 
409
Do You Still Remember: The Answers21
support or to support someone by harming some￾one else, it is required to choose the option of the 
omission.
20.4 A legal norm order must be the only one and it 
must be complete and consistent in order to ensure 
that legal conficts between members of the legal 
system can always be decided by a court on the 
basis of the law. Unity, completeness, and consis￾tency are ensured by the fact that the legal order is 
developed by deduction (from the constitution to 
the individual legal decision). This effect is at risk 
if the corpus of human rights has been introduced 
in the legal system, because this causes the pre￾dominance of morality over positive law. The sys￾tem of moral rules is developed in an inductive 
manner. It can therefore be incomplete or incon￾sistent. Therefore, the moral rule of the legal sys￾tem can lead to legal dilemmas that cannot be 
decided based on positive law.
