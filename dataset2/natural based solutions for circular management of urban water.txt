Roberta Salomone, University of Messina, Messina, ItalyThis book series aims at exploring the rising feld of Circular Economy (CE) which 
is rapidly gaining interest and merit from scholars, decision makers and practitioners 
as the global economic model to decouple economic growth and development from 
the consumption of fnite natural resources. This feld suggests that global 
sustainability can be achieved by adopting a set of CE principles and strategies such 
as design out waste, systems thinking, adoption of nature-based approaches, shift to 
renewable energy and materials, reclaim, retain, and restore the health of ecosystems, 
return recovered biological resources to the biosphere, remanufacture products or 
components, among others.
However, the increasing complexity of sustainability challenges has made 
traditional engineering, business models, economics and existing social approaches 
unable to successfully adopt such principles and strategies. In fact, the CE feld is 
often viewed as a simple evolution of the concept of sustainability or as a revisiting 
of an old discussion on recycling and reuse of waste materials. However, a modern 
perception of CE at different levels (micro, meso, and macro) indicates that CE is 
rather a systemic tool to achieve sustainability and a new eco-effective approach of 
returning and maintaining waste in the production processes by closing the loop of 
materials. In this frame, CE and sustainability can be seen as a multidimensional 
concept based on a variety of scientifc disciplines (e.g., engineering, economics, 
environmental sciences, social sciences). Nevertheless, the interconnections and 
synergies among the scientifc disciplines have been rarely investigated in depth.
One signifcant goal of the book series is to study and highlight the growing 
theoretical links of CE and sustainability at different scales and levels, to investigate 
the synergies between the two concepts and to analyze and present its realization 
through strategies, policies, business models, entrepreneurship, fnancial instruments 
and technologies. Thus, the book series provides a new platform for CE and 
sustainability research and case studies and relevant scientifc discussion towards 
new system-wide solutions.
Specifc topics that fall within the scope of the series include, but are not 
limited to, studies that investigate the systemic, integrated approach of CE and 
sustainability across different levels and its expression and realization in different 
disciplines and felds such as business models, economics, consumer services and 
behaviour, the Internet of Things, product design, sustainable consumption & 
production, bio-economy, environmental accounting, industrial ecology, industrial 
symbiosis, resource recovery, ecosystem services, circular water economy, circular 
cities, nature-based solutions, waste management, renewable energy, circular 
materials, life cycle assessment, strong sustainability, and environmental education, 
among others.Alexandros Stefanakis • Hasan Volkan Oral

Circular Cities Solution with Biophilic 
Design and Nature-Based Solutions
Makbulenur Onur and Cengiz Acar
Abstract Today, as a result of the increasing population, needs and deterioration in 
the supply/demand balance and the destructive effects of humans on nature have 
increased. Parallel to this result, it also caused the deterioration of the ecological 
balance. Human beings, who feel that they have control and power over nature, have 
disrupted the balance of nature over time and have become increasingly distant from 
nature in this deteriorated balance. Urban green spaces are struggling with many 
problems that can be described as “urban disease”. The United Nations shows that 
the world population will reach approximately 10 billion in 2050. In response to 
these problems, innovative approaches are applied to design more livable, healthy, 
sustainable, and resilient cities. Biophilic design and nature-based solutions (NbS) 
are at the forefront of these approaches. Although both approaches are based on 
sustainability, their focus is different. One of the general objectives of our research 
is to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure in terms 
of biophilic design and nature-based solutions. The specic objectives of this 
research are (1) to compile monitoring and evaluation indicators for biophilic plan￾ning with biophilic design pioneers such as Wilson (Biophilia: the human bond with 
other species. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1984), Beatley (Biophilic cit￾ies: integrating nature into urban design and planning. Washington, DC, Island 
Press, 2010), (2) to determine how these parameters can be used to lead innovation 
through an expert survey, and (3) questioning how to improve health, well-being, 
and productivity in the built environment. It is foreseen that a method proposal can 
be developed to create sustainable cities, thanks to the ndings obtained as a result 
of this research, expert surveys, and method diagram.

1.1 Introduction
Mankind has changed the balance of nature in line with their own needs and 
demands. In order to restore this balance, many design approaches, policies, and so 
on provided many suggestions. In fact, the actor who breaks down and fxes in this 
process is “human being”. Cities also play an important role in the realization of the 
concept of a sustainable or transformable city. In this context, the rapid increase in 
the rate of urbanization throughout the world negatively affects the carrying capac￾ity of the natural environment. This drags cities into more negative conditions 
day by day.
In the twenty-frst century, the world population rate is increasing day by day. 
Therefore, the demand for basic services such as energy, food, and water continues 
to rise. The demographic changes experienced due to the increase in the urban pop￾ulation and migration bring the expectations for the economical, effcient, and fair 
distribution of resources to the agenda of local actors more. According to the 2018 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, global climate change 
will cause irreversible damage to humans, the built environment, and the biosphere 
(IPCC 2015).
Urbanization is a physical and social process. How these processes develop is 
important. As a result of the industrial revolution, this process has revealed the 
concept called “urbanization”. It has become a serious problem for underdevel￾oped or developing countries with the effect of the serious population increase in 
the twentieth century (Weber et al. 1958; Ateş et al. 2019). In the cities of the 
future, an amalgamation of challenges looms large, encompassing not solely the 
burgeoning population growth, pressing environmental concerns, the intricate 
conundrum of urban waste management, and the palpable depletion of fnite 
resources, but also navigating through the intricate tapestry of a transforming 
social fabric catalyzed by the rapid evolution of information technologies. This 
confuence of circumstances has invariably spurred a heightened call for the adop￾tion and implementation of ecological approaches to address these multifac￾eted issues.
The concept of sustainability says that ecological and human capital are 
worth protecting (Friedrich 2021). Wackernagel et al., in his study in 1999, say 
that the frst of these purposes is the protection of the habitat. Heckman (2000) 
expresses the nature worth protecting as the sum of human knowledge and 
skills. This can be explained as being inspired by natural events (Wilson 1984). 
There are different views on how to protect sustainable life and ecological 
potential (Bjørn and Hauschild 2013; Ryberg et al. 2018; Friedrich 2021). These 
approaches do not mean that the ecology lost in nature is brought back in any 
way (Turner 1993).
M. Onur and C. Acar3
1.2 From the Theory of Biophilia to Biophilic Design
Man’s relationship with nature starts from the moment of biological existence and 
continues until his death. Nature is good for people physically and mentally (Beatley 
2010; Hickman 2013; Kellert and Wilson 1993; Rohde and Kendle 1994; Ulrich 
1984; Wilson 1984; Kellert and Calabrese 2015). Biophilic design, which is an 
advocating approach, frst emerged as a concept and then took its place in space 
designs. It is an approach used even in urban planning today. The concept of bio￾philia, which was frst introduced by psychologist Erich Fromm (1964), was defned 
as “passionate love for life and living things.” Fromm (1964) argues that the connec￾tion between humans and nature is biologically registered (Fromm 1964). The bio￾philia hypothesis, which is a new concept in theory but based on the existence of 
human beings in practice, connects the physical and mental evolution of human 
beings to the natural elements around them.
Landscape designers use natural elements and topography to balance nature and 
the built environment, thus making urban environments more livable and attractive. 
This design approach is related to biophilic design. Biophilic design proposed by 
Wilson (1984) and Kellert et al. (2011) and others is a method of landscape archi￾tecture that includes natural elements such as trees, water and natural lines, and 
ecologies in the built environment. The basis of the work is to be inspired by nature 
and to solve the ecological problems that occur by being inspired by nature.
This design process is in two ways: (1) “organic or naturalistic,” which refers to 
environmental features, natural shapes, forms, patterns, and processes and (2) “land 
based or local”, which refers to and evolved from place-based relationships and 
human–nature relations (Kellert et al. 2008).
Kellert in his study conducted in 2010 discussed the nature of space under three 
main titles. These are direct experience of nature, indirect experience of nature, and 
experience of space and place. There are sub-parameters under the three main 
parameters. The main and sub-parameters are very important in the implementation/
perception of biophilic design (Table 1.1).

The direct experience of nature expresses real contact with environmental fea￾tures such as light, air, water, plants, animals, weather, natural landscapes and eco￾systems, and fre in the built environment. It refers to the indirect experience of 
nature, representation or image of nature, transformation of nature, or exposure to 
certain patterns and processes that occur in nature. The experience of space and 
place refers to the characteristic spatial features of the natural environment that 
promote human health and well-being. Landscapes are spatial features such as shel￾ter, integration of parts with the whole, mobility, and direction fnding. The 24 bio￾philic design features identifed in three categories are listed in Table  1.1
(Kellert 2018).
Biophilic design is about creating good habitats for humans as biological organ￾isms in the built environment. Like all species, humans experience disruptions due 
to artifcial forces. Biophilic design aims to satisfy these natural adaptations in the 
modern built environment and, in doing so, improve people’s physical and mental 
health and wellness. The view that interacting with nature provides various psycho￾logical and physiological benefts to human health has been defended throughout 
history.
With the increase in urbanization in recent years, natural areas and natural ele￾ments have been replaced by manmade areas and mass production. This situation 
triggered more research on the relationship between man and nature by experts and 
led to the development of scientifc studies. It has been accepted by expert employ￾ees that being together with nature has positive effects on human psychology; more￾over, the view that watching nature, being close to an area that offers the opportunity 
to interact with nature, and knowing that it can be reached when desired provides 
psychological benefts to people as well as being in one-to-one contact with nature 
(Ulrich and Parsons 1992). When the pioneering studies on biophilic design are 
evaluated, the following explanations have been made on this term:
Biophilic design is an attempt to translate the natural systems inherent in human beings 
with an understanding to relate to nature (Wilson 1984).
Biophilic design is the planning of the inherent human need to relate to nature in the design 
of the built environment (Kellert et al. 2008).
Biophilic design balances human needs with the value and considerations of natural envi￾ronments and processes and incorporates the properties and qualities of these elements into 
architectural design (Dillon 2008).
The most important point that the supporters of the biophilic design emphasize is 
the human effort to survive in the evolutionary process, the success of production, 
and the bond they establish with life; this bond is valid as a feeling of closeness to 
nature and is a common feeling that every human has.
M. Onur and C. Acar5
1.3 Biophilic Design and Nature-Based Solutions
Nature-based solution is basically a study to protect natural resources. In fact, it 
is an approach that evaluates new approaches and is inspired by nature (Fink 
2016; Pearlmutter et al. 2021). At this point, biophilic design and nature-based 
solutions (NbS) intersect. Nature-based solutions use nature and fnd solutions 
to problems inspired by nature (Fig.  1.1). These solutions provide numerous 
benefts to the economy, society, and ecological systems. It is also defned as 
living solutions designed to address various environmental challenges, sup￾ported by natural processes and structures (European Commission 2016; 
Frantzeskaki 2019).
Therefore, the intersection of biophilic design approach and NbS is very impor￾tant. Databases were analyzed in order to examine which studies included “bio￾philic design approach” and “NbS solutions” in scientifc databases. Scopus and 
WOS were used to search for peer-reviewed, academic literature in the feld of 
biophilic design and NbS. Figure 1.2 details the search methodology for this narra￾tive review. A vast amount of sustainable literature was looked at for this review, 
which gives an overview of some of the key fndings. It is not meant to be exhaustive 
but to provide an insight into the quality and quantity of evidence for each of the 
three biophilic experiences as found in the literature.
When the publications made under the keyword “biophilic design” in the Web of 
Science database were examined, it was determined that the main topic of 194 pub￾lications was biophilic design, and the highest rate between 2013 and 2022 was in 
2022 (24.227%) (Fig. 1.3, Table 1.2).
Among the results obtained, the lowest rates were obtained between 2013 
(1546%), 2014 (2062%), and 2015 (2577%). The increasing rate of results every 
year is among the important fndings.
When the publications made under the keyword “Nature-based solutions (NbS)” 
in the Web of Science database are examined, it is seen that the main topic of 471 
publications is “Nature-Based Solutions”, 54,410% in the “Environmental Sciences” 
area, 18.896% in the “Environmental Studies” area, and 13,376% in the “Ecology” 
area (Table 1.3).

1.4 Biophilic Design and Nature-Based Solutions 
in Circular Cities
If cities could become adaptable urban ecosystems with biophilic design and NbS 
approaches, their ecological footprint would be reduced. At the same time, urban 
resource security will increase, the health of the urban population will improve, 
urban welfare will increase, and urban greenhouse gas emissions will decrease. 
These are the main goals that support the circular city.
These goals are actually the common points of biophilic design and NbS 
(Fig. 1.4). Therefore, biophilic design and NbS can help address these issues as a 
circular development approach to the regeneration of our cities. However, although 
biophilic design and nature-based solutions are concepts that are so close to each 
other, no study in which these two concepts are combined has been found among the 
sources reached.
Nature-based approaches, together with biophilic elements and attributes (Kellert 
2018), can be combined in many parts of the city. These can be considered in three 
scales. In a large scale, “green corridors, coastal areas, and urban forests” appear as 
“urban parks, pocket parks” in a medium scale, and applications in small scales are 
indoor and outdoor applications (Fig. 1.5).

Fig. 1.6 Contribution of nature-based approaches to cities
When city applications are implemented as shown in Fig. 1.6, they can be cate￾gorized into four main groups, i.e., ecological, aesthetic, economic, and social 
contributions.
1.5 Conclusion
Rapid and unplanned urbanization and uncontrolled population growth brought 
about by metropolitanization create negative environmental effects. For this reason, 
studies investigating alternative solutions for nature-based approaches are on the 
agenda of countries. As these problems progress, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem 
services and urban resilience problems are expected to increase.
In this process, cities and societies that try to adapt by keeping up with the fow 
instead of resisting change will suffer minimal damage from the climate crisis. This 
process can be evaluated as an opportunity to develop while preserving nature. The 
restrictions of the Covid-19 global epidemic have shown that nature enters the recov￾ery process at a great speed when the pressure on nature is reduced. Cities can also 
heal together with nature. The most important example of this will be with the coop￾eration of biophilic design and NbS, which produces solutions inspired by nature.
Urban systems are dependent on nature and natural resources. Where possible, 
nature-based planning of investments in cities will make cities resilient. In order to 
achieve the sustainable development goals, nature-based solutions must be 
implemented.
1 Circular Cities Solution with Biophilic Design and Nature-Based Solutions10
As a result, the research is at the common intersection of the concept of circular 
cities, NbS, and biophilic design. This study aims to both contribute to the literature 
on circular cities with these concepts and simultaneously establish foundational 
data for future research. Findings on these concepts show that these approaches can 
solve many ecological, social, and economic problems facing cities. This triple 
intersection also defnes the potential benefts of adopting circular urban systems. 
Therefore, taking a circular approach to development can help revitalize our cities.

Abstract Climate change affects all nations and requires increasing awareness 
about sustainability and circularity. A vast percentage of the population lives in 
urban areas, about 75% in Europe. There are plenty of aspects in cities toward sus￾tainability, including environmental, social, human, economic, and ecological. In 
addition, there are numerous kinds of nature-based solutions (NbS), such as green 
infrastructures, natural treatment and recovery, rainwater management, and 
increases in green spaces. However, using several NbS, such as green roofs, renew￾able energy, or urban farming in one building is not possible simply due to the limit 
of the roof area. Therefore, to consider as many aspects as possible simultaneously, 
one way could be multidisciplinary NbS interventions. In this regard, this study 
aims to analyze multipurpose NbS interventions to maximize sustainable systems 
and increase the circularity of cities. Therefore, the possibility of mixing green roofs 
and solar panels, urban farming using gray water and atmosphere water harvesting, 
multipurpose plants for green spaces for landscape and animal food and biofuel, and 
similar techniques and innovative methods have been investigated. Moreover, the 
advantages of the selected multipurpose NbS interventions are presented. The out￾comes show the role of the purpose techniques in increasing the efciency, sustain￾ability, acceptance rate by customers, and circularity level of the city.

2.1 Introduction
2.1.1 Urbanization and Climate Change
Around half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and the urbanization 
trend is increasing. According to predictions, the urbanization rate will reach more 
than 80% by 2050 (UNEP 2012). One of the consequences of this variation would 
be global climate change (Bona et al. 2023). Increasing urbanization and natural 
hazard risks by climate change raise humans’ vulnerability, which settled more con￾centrated in the cities (Brinkley et al. 2013). In addition, the features of the cities, 
such as less permeable areas, amplifed the intensity of climate change impacts 
(Hobbie and Grimm 2020). The urbanization rate depends on population growth, 
which is increasing unstoppably in many areas. Therefore, understanding how 
urbanization changes the environment and how the impacts (land use, temperature, 
infltration rate, wind velocity, rainfall, heat island, evaporation, evapotranspiration, 
energy balance, etc.) can be minimized would be useful to increase the livability of 
cities (Maheshwari et al. 2020).
2.1.2 Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) and Their Advantages 
in the Urban Environment
The European Commission (EC) has defned NbS as follows (Maes and Jacobs 2017):
…living solutions inspired by, continuously supported by, and using nature, which are 
designed to address various societal challenges in a resource-effcient and adaptable 
manner and to simultaneously provide economic, social, and environmental benefts.
The main identifed principal advantages of NbS by the EC (European 
Commission 2015):
– NbS could increase sustainable urbanization, increase economic growth besides 
improving the environment, enhancing human well-being, and making cities 
more attractive.
– NbS could restore degraded ecosystems and thus improve the resilience of 
ecosystems.
– NbS could mitigate climate change.
– NbS could enhance the storage of carbon.
– NbS could improve natural risk management and decrease natural disaster 
damages.
B. Pirouz et al.15
There is a growing recognition that NbS, as an integrated approach, is a vital 
strategy for climate change (Seddon et al. 2020, 2021). NbS are interventions where 
people try to restore nature and improve urbanization as a part of nature that brings 
benefts for people and biodiversity (Cohen-Shacham et al. 2019) while at the same 
time supporting sustainable development goals (SDGs) (Gómez Martín et al. 2020; 
Maes et al. 2019).
NbS interventions have the potential to deal with climate adaptation and mitiga￾tion (Langergraber et al. 2021), decrease food risk (Brunetti et al. 2018; Carbone 
et al. 2015), increase food and water security (Boelee et al. 2017), mitigation of 
climate change, improvement of sustainable livelihoods, ecosystems, and biodiver￾sity (Cohen-Shacham et  al. 2019), improvement of building thermal behavior 
(Maiolo et al. 2020), a decrease in energy consumption (Pirouz et al. 2020b), and so 
forth. In addition, NbS could address one or more urban challenges in sustainable 
ways (Pirouz et al. 2020a), such as the environment, economy, society, and health 
benefts (Raymond et  al. 2017). The major advantages of NbS are as follows 
(Liquete et al. 2016; Raymond et al. 2017):
• Social health and benefts: Reduce food risk and improve people’s recreation 
and health.
• Environmental benefts: Improve water quality and support wildlife.
• Economic benefts: Produce market goods and reduce public costs.
However, there are some drawbacks to some NbS. The main diffculties of some 
NbS, like green building, are as follows (Banerjee and Akuli 2014):
– High implementing costs.
– Lack of information about the advantages.
– Lack of human resources and skills.
– Uncertainty about performances.
– Diffculties in fnding alternative raw material inputs and manufacturing 
technology.
2.1.3 Sustainable Development and NbS
The impacts of human activities (industrialization, burning fossil fuels, urbaniza￾tion, carbon emissions, population growth, etc.) alter the climate and negatively 
affect the environment, and sustainable development means the procedures for sus￾taining human activities in the present and future (Lavrinenko et al. 2019). In 1992, 
this became one of the most urgent focuses for international policy at the United 
Nations Earth Summit (Chichilnisky 1997). A low-carbon city is a city with mini￾mum carbon emissions. In contrast, a low-carbon policy plays a role in sustainabil￾ity but does not guarantee it. In fact, a sustainable city means a city with long-term 
socioeconomic sustainability, minimum resource abuse, and without negative eco￾logical impacts (UNEP 2012).
2 The Role of Multipurpose NbS Interventions in Increasing the Circularity of Cities16
The 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) include SDG 1: No Poverty, SDG 
2: Zero Hunger, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 4: Quality Education, 
SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7: Affordable 
and Clean Energy, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 9: Industry, 
Innovation, and Infrastructure, SDG 10: Reduced Inequality, SDG 11: Sustainable 
Cities and Communities, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 
13: Climate Action, SDG 14: Life Below Water, SDG 15: Life on Land, SDG 16: 
Peace and Justice Strong Institutions, SDG 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal 
(United Nations Foundation 2023).
2.1.4 Circularity of Cities and NbS
A circular city means moving from a linear economy to a circular economy (CE). 
CE system means minimizing resource consumption, waste, and emissions 
(Langergraber et al. 2020; Pearlmutter et al. 2020), decreasing the cities’ environ￾mental footprint, closing the loops of urban material and resource fows, and creat￾ing new business opportunities (Bjørn Vidar Vangelsten et al. 2020).
The key parameters in circularity are as follows (Cruz 2019; OECD 2020; Oral 
et al. 2021; Williams 2021):
– Society and environment (improvements of cities’ ecological footprint, public 
health, urban safety, air, forest, land use, built environment and limiting harmful 
urban effects).
– Supply chain (consumption of natural resources, circularity of resources and 
materials, domestic product production, repair, waste, reuse, water, etc.)
– Partnership among stakeholders.
– Energy.
– Economic and business (agriculture, food, tourism, improve existing urban 
conditions).
– Infrastructure and technology (mobility and industry).
– Financial, correlated to cost or cost-saving related to the circular economy.
– Market circularity.
– Governments (public administration, suitable strategies, resistance to adopt 
policies).
There are interconnections between NbS and circular economy and circular city. 
For example, taking advantage of buildings’ roofs (green buildings) that include 
green roofs, living walls, green facades, house trees, etc. can increase the circularity 
of the cities (Calheiros and Stefanakis 2021). These types of NbS can improve eco￾system services, thus contributing to a circular economy (CE) in several ways 
(Alhashimi 2018; Allen et al. 2015; Pearlmutter et al. 2020):
– Green building materials (materials more natural, more economical with less 
waste, water usage, energy usage, etc.).
– Green building systems (minimizing impacts on the environment, improving 
urban life quality, etc.).
B. Pirouz et al.17
– Green building sites (minimizing environmental conficts by the buildings).
– Improve and protect biodiversity;
– Improve and protect ecosystems.
2.1.5 Urban Farming as a Multidisciplinary NbS
Urban farming could play a key role in a circular city (CC) as it can maximize 
the reuse of resources for food and biomass production and minimize external 
resources (Canet-Martí et al. 2021). The shorter distance between consumers 
and food production sites through urban farming could decrease costs from 
delivery to storage, fuel costs, and impact on clean air and climate change miti￾gation. Moreover, short food supply chains contribute directly to food security 
by reducing reaction times to consumer demands (Aubry and Kebir 2013; 
Pölling and Mergenthaler 2017; Song et al. 2021). Moreover, urban gray water 
can be reused for not-drinking usage such as urban farming, thus decreasing 
purifed water resource consumption (López Zavala et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2020; 
Sahoo and Manna 2018). Treatment and reuse of gray water could save 29–47% 
of drinking water consumed (Humeau et al. 2011).
Advantages of urban food production (Liquete et al. 2016; Massonneau 2012; 
Skar et al. 2020; van Niekerk et al. 2011):
– Production of fresh vegetables, fruits, fowers, etc.
– Production of small animals on rooftops.
– Reduction of urban runoff.
– Thermal advantages for the building.
– Reduction of urban heat island effect.
– Social, environmental, and economic advantages.
– Reduction greenhouse gas emissions.
– Climate change adaptation.
– Disaster risk management.
– Sustainable cities.
– Water resource management.
– Improvement of biodiversity.
Disadvantages of urban food production (De Zeeuw et al. 2011; Draper 2010; 
Smit et al. 1997; van Niekerk et al. 2011):
– Exposure to pesticides.
– Potential for disease transmission (i.e., bird/chicken fu in the case of animal 
production).
– Contamination.
– The unsuitability of urban soil/air for food production.
– High weight.
– Costs of protection and structural supports.
– Maintenance cost.
2 The Role of Multipurpose NbS Interventions in Increasing the Circularity of Cities18
The literature review analysis shows the advantages of NbS in the circularity and 
sustainability of cities. However, a rank system to consider both circularity and 
sustainability parameters is missed in the previous studies and, therefore, will be 
analyzed in this research. Moreover, the role of new NbS with more multifunction￾ality is missed in the previous studies and will be considered in the current research.
2.2 Materials and Methods
This study tried to improve the circularity and sustainability rate of the NbS and 
analyze the role of multipurpose NbS interventions to achieve a better result. The 
study fowchart is shown in Fig. 2.1.
As shown in Fig. 2.1, in the frst step, to be able to analyze and compare the 
advantages of multifunctional NbS, we selected the NbS based on the results of a 
study by Oral et al. (2021), and we applied the calculated total circularity score 
(TCS). In the second step, we did another analysis and calculated the total sustain￾ability score (TSS), and we created another qualitative assessment score as the total 
score (TS) by mixing both scores, meaning circularity and sustainability. In the third 
step, we changed the elements of the NbS in a way to make the conventional NbS 
more multipurpose, and repeated the previous steps. In the fourth step, we com￾pared the new multipurpose NbS scores to the previous ones and, fnally, some 
recommendations for improving the applications of NbSs.

The selected NbS are presented in Table 2.1.

Priority Weights with Triangular Fuzzy Numbers Scale
Various scales have been presented in the case of fuzzy triangular numbers for 
weighting the degree of importance of parameters. In this chapter, we have used the 
triangular fuzzy importance scale presented in (Elevli 2014). See Table  2.2 for 
details.
Figure 2.3 shows the intersection between these fuzzy linguistic scales (TFN 
scales).

2.3 Results and Discussion
2.3.1 Contributions of the NbS Units to SDGs
Figures 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 present the contributions of the main NbS units 
to different SDGs. The contributions have been determined according to the depen￾dency of each unit on the SDGs, for example, in Fig. 2.4, units for rainwater man￾agement. The unit’s contribution is high in SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being and 
SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, and low in SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and 
Infrastructure, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and SDG 13: Climate 
Action. The contributions to other SDGs are not too much and therefore are 
neglected in the fgures.

2.3.2 Connections Among the Selected NbS and SDGs
Based on the triangular fuzzy importance scale (Table 2.2), a fuzzy scale has been 
determined for all 12 selected NbS in this study (Table 2.1). The scales are accord￾ing to the correlations of the NbS and each SDG. In Figs. 2.10 and 2.11, the correla￾tions between the NbS and SDGs are shown.
As shown in Figs. 2.10 and 2.11, the most multipurpose NbS from the selected 
list, based on correlations to more SDGs, are productive gardens, large urban parks, 
intensive green roofs, and river restoration. In addition, the fewer contributions 
belonged to the dry swale, infltration trench, coastal erosion control, and bioreten￾tion cell (rain garden).

In this section, we tried to increase the applications and multidisciplinary of the 
selected NbS with novel solutions. The new NbS are shown as subcategories of the 
main NbS in Table 2.4. The table presents just those NbS that we found a solution 
to increase the contribution to more SDGs.

As can be seen in Table 2.5, the fnal TS rankings are different from TCS and 
TSS. The TS rank achieved by considering both circularity and sustainability (all 
SDGs) could be considered a better rank. Moreover, as presented in Table 2.6, the 
total sustainability scores for the new NbS are more than the initial scores. The 
result approves the sustainability improvement by applying more multidisciplinary 
interventions by NbS.

2.4 Conclusion
Climate change affects all nations and requires increasing awareness about sustain￾ability and circularity. There are plenty of interventions and nature-based solutions 
(NbS). However, using several NbS, such as green roofs, renewable energy, or urban 
farming in one building, is not possible simply due to the limit of the roof area. 
Therefore, this study aims to analyze multipurpose NbS interventions to maximize 
sustainable systems and increase the circularity of cities.
In this regard, the contributions of 12 selected NbS to 17 sustainable develop￾ment goals (SDGs) have been analyzed. Moreover, triangular fuzzy weighting 
scales have been used to calculate two qualitative assessment scores, including the

total circularity score (TCS) and total sustainability score (TSS), and the total scores

rankings are different from TCS and TSS. The TS ranks were achieved by consider￾ing both circularity and sustainability (all SDGs); they could be considered a more 
suitable rank.

In addition, the advantages of multifunctional NbS have been explored by 
changing the elements of the selected NbS in a way to make the conventional 
NbS more multipurpose. Therefore, the possibility of mixing green roofs and 
solar panels, urban farming, and multipurpose plants for green spaces for land￾scape, animal food, and biofuel has been considered as new NbS. Finally, for the 
new multipurpose NbS, the TSS scores have been calculated and compared with 
the initial scores. According to the results, the TSS scores for the new NbS are 
more than the initial scores approving that using NbS with more multidisci￾plinary interventions could improve the cities’ sustainability perspective and 
circularity level.
2.4.1 Recommendations for Future Studies
This study confrms the viability of the proposed hypothesis. However, future stud￾ies can also analyze the cost to benefts of the multipurpose NbS. In addition, the 
success rate of the previous NbS case studies and the use of machine learning tech￾niques could improve the proposed idea.

Nature-Based Solutions for a Circular 
Water Economy: Examples of New Green 
Infrastructure
Alexandros Stefanakis
Abstract As global environmental problems are increasing the pressure on the 
built environment and ecosystems, we understand better the complexity and inter￾relation of these problems. It is more and more realized that the traditional problem￾solving approach is not the optimum way to effectively deal with these issues and 
needs to be redened. Circular economy appears not only as a new economic model 
but also as a new way of thinking, where resource efciency, waste minimization, 
redesign, and zero emissions are in focus. This approach implies that new tools and, 
in particular, new technologies are necessary to meet these criteria. Nature-based 
solutions (NbS) are ecological engineering concepts inspired by nature that provide 
solutions to many of the existing pressing problems along with various ecosystem 
services, such as enhanced biodiversity and improved well-being. In the urban built 
environment, water is a key and necessary resource for the society, the economy, 
and the ecosystems that are shared across the entire supply chain. NbS in the urban 
water management eld can play an important role in the transition to a circular 
water economy. This chapter discusses the role of NbS through different case stud￾ies and approaches.

3.1 The Rising Era of Circular Economy
The ongoing climate crisis is progressing, and we can already identify its impacts 
on a local, regional, and global scale. The vast majority of the international scien￾tifc community agrees that the extent of this impact on both the ecosystems and 
society can soon become irreversible (IPCC 2015). This means that there is an 
urgency to identify sustainable solutions to effectively deal with this pressing issue. 
The Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development introduced the 17 sustainable devel￾opment goals (SDGs), aiming at “transforming our world” (United Nations 2015). 
The Paris Agreement in 2015 set the global target to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
and promote carbon-neutral growth (UNFCCC 2018). The climate crisis is already 
transforming into a climate emergency as it is expressed across the biosphere; the 
regional and global water cycles are altering, exposing many regions to diverse 
extreme events such as foods, droughts, and erosion. The destruction of mangroves, 
coastal habitats, terrestrial forests, other habitats, and the ongoing biodiversity loss 
are further indications of this climatic emergency.
We realize now that the current linear economic model bears most of the respon￾sibility for these global issues (Webster 2021). Despite the economic growth of the 
last decades and the global poverty reduction (Chandy et al. 2013), our economies 
and societies are mostly based on the linear management of resources such as 
energy, food, and water, which created global and regional environmental problems, 
e.g., environmental pollution, ecosystem degradation, resources depletion, loss of 
biodiversity, etc.
The circular economy model suggests a new paradigm of resource management, 
focusing on the reduction of the virgin natural resources input to the economy and 
the drastic reduction of waste production (Cecchin et al. 2021; Murray et al. 2017; 
Nikolaou et al. 2021). In the circular model, the use of fnite natural resources is 
optimized and reaches its maximum effciency, while the recovery and reuse and/or 
remanufacturing of materials, components, and products at the end of their life 
cycle is central in a new design approach. At the same time, renewable energy has 
become the main energy source for these processes (Hart and Pomponi 2021; 
Stefanakis and Nikolaou 2021).
Circular economy provides the necessary tools to accelerate the transition to a 
sustainable society and to tackle climate change–related impacts (Nikolaou et al. 
2021; Stefanakis et al. 2021). As the International Ecological Engineering Society 
mentions in their manifesto, “we are dealing with multi-dimensional, complex and 
interrelated issues, which render ineffective the conventional one-dimensional lin￾ear, technology-focused approach to problem-solving… systems thinking is the frst 
critical step towards the development of new holistic and interdisciplinary engi￾neering solutions at all scales” (IEES 2023). In a circular economy, economic 
growth is decoupled from natural resource use through resource dematerialization 
(Stefanakis et al. 2021). However, the global circularity index remains at low levels, 
i.e., 8.6% in 2020 (Circle Economy 2021), which means there is a long way ahead 
to adapt interventions that would focus not only on decarbonization but also on the 
A. Stefanakis37
restoration of degraded land and water ecosystems, and on a radical change of the 
design approach for new infrastructure, particularly in the urban environment 
(Atanasova et al. 2021).
3.2 Water as a Resource in Circular Economy
Circular economy creates and implements sustainable management practices for 
raw materials, resources, and waste. Water is a fundamental resource for human 
society and ecosystems, and a key shared resource throughout the supply chain. 
However, in the current linear economic model, water is abstracted from natural 
sources (rivers, lakes, and groundwater), consumed in households, industries, agri￾culture, electricity generation, etc., and fnally “returned” to the natural sources 
directly or after a treatment process. This model led to limitations in the availability 
of freshwater sources, wastewater production, and environmental degradation due 
to climate and non-climatic changes.
Considering the latest scientifc and technological advancements in the water 
sector, academics, governments, water utilities, and industry are searching for more 
effcient models to manage water. Water resources and wastewater management 
(e.g., rainwater, urban runoff, sewage, and industrial effuents) have not attracted 
respective attention in the context of the circularity principles as is the case, for 
example, for solid waste. The discussion on circular water management has recently 
started with considerations oriented towards reducing consumption, reusing and 
recycling water and wastewater, and recovering nutrients. In general, it can be stated 
that wastewater (human waste, rainwater, and runoff) remains the largest unutilized 
category of waste, which is, however, characterized as a pillar of the circular econ￾omy by the European Commission.
Initiatives and practices for wastewater exploitation have been manifested mainly 
in countries with a more acute problem of reduced water resources availability due 
to climatic conditions, climate change impacts, and increasing cost of drinking 
water production from the ever-decreasing freshwater resources or through desali￾nation. The European Union in 2020 published a new regulation on water reuse with 
limited application in agriculture (EU 2020). A comprehensive holistic plan for the 
sustainable and effcient use of wastewater is therefore still missing.
Additionally, the model of centralized wastewater treatment plants, where reuse 
has not been typically foreseen and their location is usually prohibitive for the 
development of such plans, does not promote circular interventions (Stefanakis 
2020a). However, decentralized management of wastewater translates to a better 
dispersion of smaller treatment facilities within the hydrological basin or the wider 
urban/peri-urban area, which would promote and ease the use of alternative and 
cost-effective treatment technologies such as nature-based solutions (NbS) and 
would bring treated water closer to areas where it can be used.
Recently, scholars have introduced expressions such as “circular economy of 
water”, “circular water economy”, or “water circular economy”, although none of 
3 Nature-Based Solutions for a Circular Water Economy: Examples of New Green…38
these have yet been adopted as key terminology. Water is a valuable resource in a 
circular economy, and it is available both as a stock and as a fow, an approach of 
particular importance considering the increasing urban water pollution and the need 
for enhanced water security. Treated wastewater can be an important new source to 
the local-regional water balance in terms of both quantity and quality. Therefore, the 
treatment and reuse of wastewater is part of the UN’s Sustainable Development 
Goal (SDG) 6 to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and 
sanitation for all. In order to promote a circular water economy, collection, treat￾ment, and safe reuse of wastewater are needed. In this context, ecological engineer￾ing has a key role to play.
3.3 Nature-Based Solutions for Circular Water Management
By conserving, restoring, and managing nature, we can effectively address many 
critical issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and various socioeconomic 
challenges. From rewetting peatlands to restoring forests and saltmarshes to nurtur￾ing green areas in cities, there is a huge potential for increasing the global rollout of 
NbS, in order to meet global ambitions to tackle climate change.
NbS belong to the larger discipline of ecological engineering, a concept estab￾lished many decades ago. According to the International Ecological Engineering 
Society, “Ecological Engineers view nature as an inspiration and model to develop 
and expand the nature-based toolbox, using ecosystem services and renewable 
resources… and view the inherent value of nature as part, not only of future solu￾tions, but also of the design process itself” (IEES 2023). NbS provide various eco￾system services and can contribute to high-quality green spaces that boost resilience. 
The concept of NbS lies in biomimicry, i.e., the process where we learn from, 
inspire by, and copy nature. The key requirement for NbS is to frst understand the 
natural environment and the natural processes in order to harness the power of eco￾systems and the sophistication of nature and integrate them as infrastructure units to 
provide services that beneft the society and the environment. This means that the 
various environmental, social, and economic challenges are viewed as innovation 
opportunities (Stefanakis et al. 2021). Therefore, NbS are distinct concepts from 
nature-derived solutions such as renewable energy from wind, wave, and solar 
sources that aim at representing low-carbon energy options through production 
methods that, on the one hand, originate from natural sources but, on the other hand, 
are not directly based on functioning ecosystems.
At the 2016 World Conservation Congress and members’ assembly, the 
International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) members adopted a resolu￾tion (WCC-2016-Res-069-EN) that defned NbS for the frst time as “actions to pro￾tect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modifed ecosystems that address 
societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well￾being and biodiversity benefts” (available at https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/
library/fles/resrecfles/WCC_2016_RES_069_EN.pdf). The European Commission 
A. Stefanakis39
defnes NbS as “Solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost￾effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefts and 
help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natu￾ral features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally 
adapted, resource effcient and systemic interventions” (EU 2015). With NbS, up to 
a third of the 2030 climate change mitigation targets could be met, which is why the 
use of NbS is a priority in the EU’s strategy documents for the 2021–2027 EU cycle.
The concept of NbS is to use the features of complex natural processes, e.g., the 
ability to store carbon or regulate water fow and quality. Thus, NbS can be a key 
factor for life quality, improved public health, well-being, food and energy security, 
biodiversity, green growth, job creation, prosperity, and social, economic, and envi￾ronmental sustainability (Cohen-Shacham et al. 2016; Kolokotsa et al. 2020).
This is why NbS is considered as advantageous solutions for sustainable and 
cost-effective water and wastewater management. Wastewater management and 
sanitation are central to circular water management as clean water production, nutri￾ents and materials recovery, and energy production can be integrated into NbS inter￾ventions (Neczaj and Grosser 2018). According to the European Commission, the 
amount of wastewater treated annually in the EU exceeds 40,000 million m3
, but 
only 964 million m3
 of this is reused, revealing the huge potential to increase the 
rate of water reuse. Circular wastewater management would integrate NbS and 
effuent reuse to close the loop between water supply and sanitation. Additional 
services and benefcial interventions that can be part of circularity in the water sec￾tor include energy effciency and recovery of raw materials (Neczaj and Grosser 
2018), treated effuent reuse in irrigation of commercial crops (Stefanakis et  al. 
2018a), rainwater and greywater use for toilet fushing, car washing and garden 
irrigation (Nika et al. 2020; Sgroi et al. 2018), or separation of urine and faeces from 
greywater for maximized nutrient recovery (Neczaj and Grosser 2018; Sgroi 
et al. 2018).
The circularity aspects of the use of NbS in the water sector have been studied in 
terms of their range and diversity (Oral et al. 2021). NbS can signifcantly contribute 
to re-establishing and maintaining the water cycle, reducing runoff peaks and vol￾umes and promoting infltration, retention, and evapotranspiration (Kozak et  al. 
2020). Especially in the urban context, NbS interventions can contribute to local 
groundwater recharge by facilitating infltration processes (Keesstra et  al. 2017; 
Stefanakis et al. 2021), while land restoration enhances the water-holding capacity 
of natural land upstream of urban areas (European Environment Agency 2015). NbS 
can also mitigate the urban heat island effect through increased evapotranspiration 
by increasing the number of trees and other vegetation, e.g., roadsides (European 
Environment Agency 2015), meadows (Ferrini et al. 2020; Sanyé-Mengual et al. 
2020), rain gardens (Imran et al. 2019), green roofs, and green facades (Stovin et al. 
2013; Calheiros and Stefanakis 2021), and even implementing constructed wetland 
systems. Urban green space also contributes to well-known health benefts, such as 
longer life expectancy, minimized mental health issues, and better cognitive func￾tioning. It is accepted today that there is an urgent need to provide citizens with 
more green space (Stefanakis et al. 2018b).
3 Nature-Based Solutions for a Circular Water Economy: Examples of New Green…40
Moreover, NbS can play a vital role in rainwater harvesting and recovering and 
reusing wastewater, contributing to the reduction of drinking water quality con￾sumption and load reduction that reaches urban drainage infrastructure and waste￾water treatment facilities. Such actions would further protect downstream freshwater 
resources by preventing the pollutants contained in runoff water, blackwater, and 
greywater from reaching the surface and groundwater (Oral et al. 2021).
Since a key circular economy principle is the change of the process/production 
itself and not just the reuse of the treated effuent, the implementation of NbS and 
other ecological engineering advances fulfls this critical but often neglected prin￾ciple in the water sector (Kozak et al. 2020; Stefanakis et al. 2021). A characteristic 
example here is the signifcant rise of constructed wetland technology over the last 
two decades, which indicates that wastewater management is viewed from a differ￾ent perspective. The goal of wastewater management strategies is no longer one￾dimensional (i.e., treatment) but is further extended to the provision of multiple 
benefts such as ecosystem services, habitat creation sites, heat island mitigation, 
wildlife refuges, recreation, and landscaping (Masi et al. 2018; Stefanakis 2019).
3.4 NbS Examples
3.4.1 Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Reuse
A sustainable demonstration project was carried out at the German University of 
Technology in Oman dealing with the construction of a two-storey guesthouse 
(called “EcoHaus”). This demo house has a surface area of 250 m2
 and is designed 
for net-zero-energy performance (Knebel 2019; Stefanakis 2020a), thus aiming at 
serving as a sustainable, energy-effcient building for architects and engineers 
(Fig. 3.1).
Green building principles were considered in the design of the building, which 
has a high thermal resistance provided by a lightweight pumice and concrete block 
on the exterior layer, a loose-fll insulation of perlite in the centre, and a heavy

compressed earth block for thermal mass on the interior layer (Knebel 2019). The 
building now consumes 60% less cooling energy compared to a building with com￾mon construction methods used in most projects. In addition, the energy needs were 
covered by photovoltaic panels installed on the roof.
This sustainable demonstration project also includes NbS to provide wastewater 
treatment. A constructed wetland (CW) is built to receive domestic black and grey 
wastewater by gravity as a cost-effective and sustainable treatment method. 
Furthermore, the treated effuent is reused onsite in an adjacent garden with local 
trees and shrubs, while there is also the option to irrigate a green roof (Stefanakis 
2020a). The CW receives 1 m3
/day of wastewater, equivalent to fve persons’ pro￾duction (Al Sulaimi et al. 2017). The CW system consists of a covered settling tank 
(5 m2
) for primary treatment to remove most of the suspended solids and a horizon￾tal subsurface fow CW (15 m2
). The water level in the horizontal subsurface fow 
constructed wetland (HFCW) is maintained 5 cm below the gravel surface to pre￾vent odours and mosquitos. The CW is planted with native common reeds 
(Phragmites australis), while the treated effuent is reused at the irrigation feld.
This demonstration building integrates NbS at a University campus in an arid 
and hot climate, making this building a completely independent structure in terms 
of energy and water demand, with minimum energy consumption and maintenance 
requirements. It also highlights the combination of green building practices and 
NbS to form sustainable solutions at the smallest scale.
3.4.2 Sludge Treatment and Reuse Using Sludge Treatment 
Reed Beds
A new project was launched in early 2023 in Crete, Greece, called “Management 
and Utilization of Sewage Sludge in the Circular Economy using green technologies 
and methods”, implemented by the Technical University of Crete and fnanced by 
the Green Fund of Greece in the framework of Priority Axis 3: Research and 
Implementation of the funding program: “Natural Environment & Innovative 
Actions 2022”.
The project presents a modern approach for the management of biological sludge 
resulting from wastewater treatment based on the circular economy, testing and 
using technologies (constructed wetlands), methods (composting and biochar pro￾duction), and practices (reuse in agriculture and wastewater treatment) towards con￾verting and utilizing this benefcial by-product. The goal is to establish the circular 
economy approach in the feld of sludge management, through the dual intervention 
of changing the management paradigm: replacing mechanical and energy-intensive 
technologies with a green dewatering technology that has a low environmental foot￾print and adopting practices to produce new organic materials and utilize them in 
agriculture.
3 Nature-Based Solutions for a Circular Water Economy: Examples of New Green…42
The project follows the Action Plan of Greece for the Circular Economy 
(Government Gazette 84A/3-5-2022), contributing to the goals of reducing waste 
production, converting waste into reliable raw materials, and limiting landflling. 
These practices and methodological approaches are also in line with the EU Circular 
Economy Action Plan (2018) which is part of the Green Deal, to better manage 
biowaste and encourage waste reuse and recovery. This circular model incorporates 
at its core the need to reduce the environmental footprint and greenhouse gas emis￾sions in an important industrial sector such as waste management.
In Greece, over 50% of the sewage sludge produced in wastewater treatment 
plants (WWTPs) ends up in landflls, with limited reuse (e.g., in agriculture and 
composting). With the exception of the two largest cities (Athens and Thessaloniki), 
where the dried sludge is utilized as a fuel, in the rest of small- and medium-sized 
WWTPs of the country (as is the case of Crete), linear management is carried out 
consisting of thickening and dewatering with mechanical and chemical methods 
(e.g., calcifcation, addition of polyelectrolytes, belt presses, flter presses, and cen￾trifuges) and daily transportation and disposal of the dried sludge in landflls. This 
strategy is often economically unsustainable due to the high associated costs, as the 
total sludge management costs could represent up to 40–60% of the operating costs 
of the entire WWTP. At the same time, this strategy leads to environmental prob￾lems, such as the risk of surface and groundwater pollution, high consumption of 
energy and chemicals in mechanical drying, insuffcient drying and stabilization of 
sludge, and high environmental footprint due to the energy required and the trans￾portation to a landfll. Furthermore, landflling is at the base of the sustainability 
pyramid as sludge, and useful components are this way not utilized. The adoption 
of the circular economy principles implies not only the promotion of appropriate 
practices for the utilization of a useful and nutrient-rich material but also the adop￾tion of new green treatment technologies which themselves will minimize the envi￾ronmental footprint of the sludge drying process.
The main purpose of the project is to study a modern, innovative, and integrated 
model of circular management and utilization of the sewage sludge produced in the 
wastewater treatment plants, as a pro-environmental holistic solution to the existing 
management problem based on the circular economy principles. The aim is to study 
different technologies and alternative methods in terms of their technical adequacy 
and suitability to reduce the environmental footprint of sludge management and 
convert this by-product into a useful material. The new materials that will result 
from the examined processes are also studied for the suitability and improvement 
they bring in various reuse applications (agriculture and wastewater treatment).
Among other methods, sludge treatment wetlands or sludge treatment reed beds 
are tested in pilot experiments. For this, 16 pilot scale sludge treatment wetlands 
units of 1m2
 surface area are installed at the WWTP of Chania in Crete, Greece 
(Fig. 3.2). Different construction and operation parameters are tested such as sludge 
loading rates, different plant species, different substrate materials, presence/absence 
of earthworms, unit external insulation, and greenhouse/outdoor units. The project 
will run for 3 years. Preliminary studies of this NbS showed that it reduces the over￾all environmental footprint of sludge management by more than 75%, something

Crete, Greece
that will be re-calculated and re-confrmed at the end of the project. After the long￾term monitoring and optimization of the design, the fnal biosolid quality will be 
evaluated and then applied in agriculture to further test its contribution towards crop 
yield enhancement. This way, the cycle of sludge as a benefcial material will be 
fully closed and demonstrated under real conditions.
3.4.3 Wastewater Treatment and Reuse 
at a University Dormitory
A full-scale CW was built in the arid and warm climate at the Neyshabor University 
campus in Iran (approximately 1250 m above sea level) (Gholipour and Stefanakis 
2021). A dormitory with approx. 200 students produces greywater at an average 
water consumption rate of 20 m3
/day. The Neyshabor University is located next to 
the city’s drinking water treatment plant, which makes necessary the proper han￾dling of the greywater. Prior to this project, the dormitory wastewater was collected 
in simple underground septic tanks, which poses the risk of groundwater contami￾nation. Therefore, the goal was to provide a sustainable wastewater management 
solution integrating the reuse of the treated effuent for irrigation at the University 
campus to reduce freshwater consumption. For this, a demonstration project using 
an NbS was adopted to showcase the feasibility of NbS in the region.
The CW was built in 2018 and includes a primary stage (anaerobic baffed reac￾tor, ABR), a secondary stage (vertical fow constructed wetland, VFCW), and a 
3 Nature-Based Solutions for a Circular Water Economy: Examples of New Green…44
Fig. 3.3 The constructed wetland system at the Neyshabor University in Iran
third polishing stage (horizontal subsurface fow constructed wetland, HFCW) 
(Fig.  3.3). The ABR (47.5  m2
) is made of concrete, with a holding capacity of 
108 m3
 and is divided into three chambers (50:25:25% volume per chamber). The 
VFCW (200 m2
, assuming 1 m2
/pe; Stefanakis et al. 2014) has a bottom cobble layer 
(30 cm; 20–63 mm), a coarse gravel layer (20 cm; 5–15 mm), a top fne gravel layer 
(60 cm; 2–5 mm), and a fnal 20 cm freeboard. The VFCW is planted with local reed 
species, i.e., giant reed (Arundo donax) and pampas grass (Cortaderia selloana) in 
the bed perimeter (Gholipour et  al. 2020). The water level is maintained 20  cm 
below the fne gravel layer surface in the VFCW, thus it is partially saturated.
The VFCW effuent fows with gravity to the HFCW (250 m2
; unit area demand 
of 1.25 m2
/pe), which contains a 1-m gravel layer (8–20 mm) with a freeboard of 
20 cm and is planted with common reeds (Phragmites australis). Both CWs are 
lined with a compacted layer of fne sand and clay and an impermeable HDPE (high￾density polyethylene) membrane (1.5 mm) protected via a geotextile sheet.
The treated wastewater is collected by gravity in an underground tank (160 m3
 capac￾ity), where it is pumped out for reuse, i.e., for landscape irrigation within the university 
campus and irrigation of non-bearing trees. This simple but effective NbS provides a 
treated effuent quality complying with the national standard for reuse, demonstrating 
that NbS can provide sustainable wastewater management in an arid and warm climate 
region. It is also important that more than 90% of all materials and equipment needed 
were sourced locally, indicating the feasibility of implementing such solutions. This is 
particularly important for low-income regions with limited resources.
3.4.4 Manufacturing Industry Wastewater Treatment 
and Reuse
Effective wastewater management is still a major issue in the industrial sector. The 
management of the various industrial effuents is one of the greatest due to the vari￾ety of sources, physico-chemical composition, and pollutants’ nature, which makes 
A. Stefanakis45
it diffcult to develop standardized solutions. Moreover, there is an increasing 
demand for sustainable solutions, i.e., for technologies with lower operation costs, 
minimum external energy input, and minimized environmental footprint. Therefore, 
the use of NbS such as the green technology of CW is gaining attention and popular￾ity (Stefanakis 2020b).
This case study has to do with a glass manufacturing industry in Iran located 
within an urban area that generates wastewater from the various manufacturing pro￾cesses (washing, cooling, and cullet separation and grinding), while impurities such 
as glass splinters and silica particles form turbidity. Glass industry wastewater may 
also contain oil and/or other lubricants, dissolved salts, and water treatment chemi￾cals used in the cooling water system. Silica particles are widely present in the form 
of soluble and insoluble silica.
Conventional wastewater treatment technologies have been used in the glass indus￾try, such as membrane fltration (Kang and Choo 2006), but they are not always techni￾cally and economically feasible, thus making NbS an alternative option. Considering the 
novelty of this application and the lack of previous studies, the frst objective was to test 
the treatment concept at a pilot scale in order to de-risk the treatment. After the pilot 
phase, the results were used to build the full-scale CW in the glass industry. The Safety 
Glass Khorasan (SGK) factory in Mashhad, Iran (1043 m above sea level), consumes up 
to 30  m3
/day of tap water while producing 10  m3
/day wastewater (Gholipour et  al. 
2020). The industry regularly transports the industrial wastewater to a nearby domestic 
wastewater treatment plant, bearing the related transportation and disposal costs along 
with the daily water consumption cost. Thus, the goal of the CW was to recycle the 
treated effuent in the glass manufacturing processes (Stefanakis 2020a).
The pilot-scale CW comprised a settling tank with an integrated upfow fltration 
layer and a horizontal subsurface fow constructed wetland (HSFCW) (Fig. 3.4). 
The 15-cm upfow fltration layer was made of natural cobbles (5–60 mm) and was 
installed at the top of the settling tank to retain suspended solids and to promote 
natural focculation of insoluble silica particles (SiO2). The HSFCW was flled with 
natural gravel (10–20  mm) and planted with native pampas grass (Cortaderia 
Selloana). The treatment results of the pilot unit showed that the tested CW not only 
reached the national discharge standard but also provided an effuent quality appro￾priate for recycling in the industrial process. Therefore, the full-scale CW was 
installed at the glass factory comprising a settling tank with two settling compart￾ments (each 8.75 m2
), a third collection compartment as the primary stage, and a 
HSFCW (150 m2
) (Gholipour et al. 2020).
The tested NbS proved to be successful in fulflling the goal set. The treatment 
includes only natural processes and materials without the use of energy or chemi￾cals. Energy is consumed only by a small pump that recycles the treated effuent 
back to the industrial processes. Therefore, greenhouse gas emissions are practi￾cally eliminated, considering that wastewater transportation is also phased out. In 
addition, freshwater consumption in the industry is reduced by 35–40% due to the 
effuent recycling. This case study demonstrates the potential to apply circular econ￾omy practices by removing unsustainable practices and implementing NbS to fur￾ther reduce water consumption.

3.4.5 Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Reuse in Agriculture
Α hybrid constructed wetland (HCW) system was installed in a small community in 
the Central Bohemian region of the Czech Republic. The full-scale CW treats mixed 
wastewater effuents discharged from a hotel, a restaurant, and a brewery, while the 
treated wastewater is reused for the irrigation of various types of crops. The CW 
consists of fve treatment stages (Fig. 3.5): (i) a septic tank, (ii) a horizontal flter 
(HF), (iii) a vertical flter (VF), (iv) a combined flter consisting of an unsaturated 
vertically fowed part and a saturated horizontally fowed part (HVF), and (v) stabi￾lization pond (SP). The calculated treatment capacity of the system is 150 popula￾tion equivalent (PE) with a maximum daily wastewater infow of 16.5 m3
/day and 
an area demand of 2.2 m2
/pe. The HCW basins covered a total area of 319 m2
 and 
are planted with common reed (Phragmites australis), reed canary grass (Phalaris 
arundinacea), common cattail (Typha latifolia), purple loosestrife (Lythrum salci￾aria), and yellow iris (Iris pseudacorus).
The experimental irrigation feld was split into two areas, and two sources of 
water were used for the experiments, fresh water from a well (fresh water), and 
treated wastewater (WW) from the HCW collected in the SP. The experimental feld 
has an area of 49 m2
 (7 × 7 m) and is built so that it is a waterproofed tub using 
plastic PVC foil with a depth of 0.7 m. The experimental area was divided into four 
1.5-m-wide plots, of which two were planted with various model crops and two 
remained unplanted (control). Treated WW and fresh water were each applied to 
one of the planted and one of the unplanted plots, thus creating four differing treat￾ment areas. Drip irrigation hoses were installed in each section of the irrigation feld 
in the form of three parallel lines. The experimental feld was planted with common 
garden crops, one variety of each; in 2018, tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.), 
were planted, whereas in 2019, three crops were planted: tomatoes (Solanum lyco￾persicum L.), potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), and lettuces (Lactuca sativa L.).
The results have been presented in the literature (Šereš et al. 2021). The CW 
facility reached high removal rates for all monitored parameters, e.g., biochemical 
oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), N–NH4+, total N, and 
total suspended solids (TSS), except for total P, while signifcant removal of several 
pathogenic microorganisms (E. coli, intestinal enterococci, and thermotolerant

coliforms) was also observed. A signifcant enhancement of crop growth irrigated 
with wastewater effuent from the HCW was found due to the fertilizing effect. 
Tomato yield increased by 133% in the feld irrigated with treated wastewater, as 
also found for potatoes (76% increase) and lettuces (104% increase). The results of 
this study demonstrate that the use of wastewater for irrigation can lead to signif￾cant savings in the consumption of fresh water for the irrigation of agricultural 
crops as well as savings in the application of fertilizers. The study also showed that 
the tested NbS, i.e., the hybrid CW, can provide adequate wastewater treatment and 
sanitation at a level of effciency that is comparable to other conventional systems.
3.5 Conclusions
The adoption of the circular economy model means that we should change the way 
we think and the way we manage our resources in order to effectively tackle climate 
change impacts. In the water sector, system thinking is important, given that circular 
practices are not yet widely adopted and applied in water resources and wastewater 
management. The use of nature-based solutions appears to be an ideal opportunity 
3 Nature-Based Solutions for a Circular Water Economy: Examples of New Green…48
to promote the sustainability aspect of water and wastewater management, through 
water reuse and recycling. The presented case studies showed that the dual goal of 
implementing sustainable technologies and adopting circular practices is techni￾cally and economically feasible. The use of nature-based solutions for wastewater 
management allows the recycling of the treated effuent in the industrial process, 
reducing this way freshwater consumption and also enabling the treated effuent 
reuse in irrigation. The circular wastewater management approach provides a big 
potential to close the loop of water and further valorize benefcial materials such as 
nutrients and sludge.

Assessment of Urban Rain Gardens Within 
Climate Change Adaptation 
and Circularity Challenge
Kevser Karabay, Havva Öztürk, Eda Ceylan, and Derya Ayral Çınar
Abstract Decreasing permeable surfaces in cities due to growing population and 
more frequent high-intensity rainfalls due to climate change lead to oods. The 
consequences are loss of freshwater resource, disruption of natural water cycle, and 
sewer outow and spread of untreated wastewater into the environment. Adaptations 
to decrease the vulnerability of cities to heavy rainfalls need to integrate solutions 
that have a circular perspective. Nature-based solutions (NbS) can be helpful to 
adapt urban infrastructure to align with circular cities that are more sustainable. 
Rain garden, which is one of the best management practices suggested to manage 
stormwater, can provide many hydraulic benets such as surface runoff volume 
reduction, peak ow reduction, and ow mitigation. Therefore, it can reduce the 
stress on the stormwater infrastructure. At the same time, it acts as a treatment tool 
by removing the pollutants from rain water. Furthermore, it provides a recharge area 
for groundwater where runoff percolates into the subsurface. Apart from these, a 
rain garden offers several solutions to mitigation of urbanization and global warm￾ing, such as reducing heat island formation and carbon footprints and supporting 
biodiversity. This study reviewed the literature to quantify contributions of rain gar￾dens to mitigate the impacts of climate change and enhance circularity in cities.

4.1 Introduction
As reported by the United Nations (2022), the percentage of urban population has 
increased from 47% in 2000s to 56% in 2020, and it is projected to reach 68% by 
2050. On the other hand, the urban area has increased only from 1.25% to 1.5% 
between 2000 and 2015, which means the increase in urban population could not be 
balanced by urban land expansion, resulting in growing population density in cities. 
Overpopulation has brought higher demand for construction to provide buildings 
for accommodation, health, transportation, and education services. Consequently, 
green areas in the cities have been destroyed and replaced by impermeable surfaces. 
Even soil surfaces in cities could be impermeable due to compaction as a result of 
increasing settlement, construction activities, and intensive vehicle use. Compaction 
of soil was found to induce bulk density increase and infltration decrease of 70–99% 
(Itsukushima et  al. 2022). This change in land cover affected the water cycle in 
urban areas severely by decreasing infltration into the subsurface and threating 
groundwater resources. Therefore, one of the valuable fresh water sources is facing 
depletion, and water shortage in cities becomes more likely. Another critical result 
of reduced infltration is higher surface runoff and stress on the existing stormwater 
systems. Besides water cycle, urbanization modifes services which are provided by 
the ecosystem to maintain the well-being of organisms. Urbanization has detrimen￾tal impacts on ecosystem services leading to loss of functions (Xu 2021). Specifcally, 
rainwater-holding capacity of urban ecosystem was infuenced negatively by urban￾ization (Wang et al. 2019a).
Climate change as a result of greenhouse gas emissions has been recognized as a 
critical problem not only in cities but worldwide and brings an increased possibility 
of extreme weather conditions such as heat and cold waves, increased precipitation, 
or drought (IPCC 2014). Especially, urban areas are determined to be more fragile 
to the impacts of climate change because the surface runoff which is already 
increased in urban areas is boosted even more by more frequent observation of high￾intensity rainfalls (Zhou et al. 2019; Oral et al. 2020). As a result, it has been fre￾quently observed that sewer infrastructure has diffculty handling the increased 
fowrate of stormwater which in turn causes urban foods accompanied with eco￾nomic and environmental loss (Chen et  al. 2016; Pour et  al. 2020). Moreover, 
municipal services like transportation, wastewater collection, and electricity might 
be suspended (Zhou et al. 2019), roads might be blocked, and properties at lower 
elevations could be fooded (Pour et al. 2020).
To sum up, combination of urbanization and climate change increases the vul￾nerability of cities, so restoration of the natural water cycle and urban water man￾agement have become extremely essential. Restoring and maintaining the water 
cycle was stated as one of the urban circularity challenges and found correlated with 
other ones like water and waste treatment, recovery and reuse, food and biomass 
production, and building system recovery (Oral et al. 2020). Nature-based solutions 
(NbS) which are defned as “Solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, 
which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and 
K. Karabay et al.53
economic benefts and help build resilience” by the European Commission are pro￾posed as an effective strategy for sustainable urban water management and food 
risk reduction within the context of circular cities (Stefanakis et al. 2021). Actually, 
NbS can promote many adaptive responses to other impacts of climate change such 
as heat island effect and risk on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Rain gardens 
are among the NbS units that provide stormwater retention and infltration. Simply, 
rain garden can be defned as a vegetated depression with different soil mixtures and 
an optional drainage layer with several side benefts such as water treatment, habitat 
and biodiversity protection, aesthetic and landscape elements, air quality improve￾ment, carbon capture, and pollination (Zhang et al. 2020).
This study extensively reviewed the literature about rain gardens to mitigate cli￾mate change and face urban circularity challenges. Quantitative contributions of 
rain gardens to restore water cycle, improve urban water management, treat pollut￾ants, reduce carbon footprint, enhance biodiversity, support ecosystem services, 
increase groundwater recharge, prevent heat island, and provide cost benefts were 
determined, and all are discussed in detail in the following sections. Also, limita￾tions and challenges of rain gardens defned in the literature were evaluated.
4.2 Restoration of Water Cycle and Urban 
Water Management
The most signifcant contribution of rain gardens to preventing foods and combined 
sewer outfows in urban areas is through detention of surface runoff and decreasing 
and delaying peak fow volume. Rain gardens can retain a large portion of runoff 
from surfaces 20 times their size (Davis 2008; Dietz and Clausen 2005; Hunt et al. 
2006; Zhang and Guo 2013). Volume-holding capacity of more than 50% (Hunt 
et al. 2008), retention of rainfall more than 79% (Johnson et al. 2019), and retention 
of infow on average 78% considering all rainfalls and 100% considering 58% of 
rainfalls (Feldman et al. 2019) were reported in the literature. Additionally, inlet 
volume decreased by 16% (Line and Hunt 2009), peak fow decreased by 7–64% 
(Autixier et al. 2014; Line and Hunt 2009), and runoff fow decreased by 13–76% 
(Alyaseri et al. 2017; Autixier et al. 2014; Davis 2008; Hunt et al. 2006; Yuan et al. 
2017) were observed in different studies. As a more specifc example, rain gardens 
were able to capture 90% of all rainfall events and direct about 99% of the infow 
into the underground. Only 1% overfow of the infuent water was observed during 
the whole analysis period, and the remaining 0.4% was assumed to be removed by 
evapotranspiration (Shuster et  al. 2017). DeBusk and Wynn (2011) reported a 
median peak fow reduction of 91% in the studied rain gardens if only infow and 
outfow were considered, where a cumulative volume reduction of more than 97% 
and decrease in peak fow rates by 99% were achieved. Guo et al. (2021) determined 
10–100% reduction in fow volume and 20–100% reduction in food peak fow in 
rain garden with waterproof underlayer and small ratio of confuence area to rain 
4 Assessment of Urban Rain Gardens Within Climate Change Adaptation…54
garden area. On the other hand, reduction in fow volume was %97 in rain garden 
with permeable underlayers and %100 in rain garden with high confuence ratios. In 
another study, rain garden was able to prevent overfow completely for the frst 
2 years after installation even during the most intense rainfalls although overfows 
occurred approximately 10 times a year before rain garden was built (Boguniewicz￾Zabłocka and Capodaglio 2020). Impact of frst fush on overfow formation was 
quantifed under different storm events in a study conducted in China. Only 5 out of 
the 28 rainfalls (0.18–3.18 cm/h) observed in 4 years (2011–2014) resulted in over￾fow. Even though three of the overfows happened in 2013, the runoff reduction rate 
was still about 97%. In addition, the overall runoff reduction rate was up to 99% 
during the 4-year monitoring period. Also, overfows occurring in the middle and 
late period of storm event indicated that the frst fush did not play a signifcant role 
in overfow formation (Tang et al. 2020).
Samouei and Özger (2020) evaluated the impact of rain garden on surface runoff 
management using a hydrologic-hydraulic model and obtained maximum runoff 
reduction in simulations with a storm event corresponding to a return period of 
2 years. However, increasing the storm event’s return period from 2 to 50 years led 
to a decrease in the peak fow reduction rate from about 25% to 12% and runoff 
volume reduction rate from about 17% to 9%. Increasing the low-impact develop￾ment (LID) application ratio from 5% to 20%, peak fow reduction increased from 
7% to 25% and runoff volume reduction increased from 5% to 17%. Furthermore, 
the number of fooded manholes and pipes were decreased to 5–18% (for 5–20% 
LID, respectively) with rainfall return period of 25 years and 3–11% (for 5–20% 
LID, respectively) with rainfall return period of 50 years. These results did not mean 
entire prevention of fooding formation but indicated a decrease in the number of 
fooded manholes and an increase in functionality of the conveyance system at the 
basin (Samouei and Özger 2020). Moreover, three LID implementations (rain water 
harvesting tanks, rain gardens, and permeable pavements) in case of different land￾use options were compared in terms of surface runoff reduction potential by Seo 
et al. (2017). Surface runoff reduction on an average annual basis was 14, 29, and 
25% for the compact high-density urban land use (UHD), the conventional medium￾density urban land use (UMD), and the conservational medium-density urban land 
use (UMC), respectively (Seo et al. 2017).
Rain gardens are generally suggested as a runoff management solution for 
smaller rainfalls. For example, Autixier et al. (2014) regarded rain gardens more 
effective to infltrate runoff completely for rainfalls below 22 mm. Additionally, rain 
gardens were found to decrease peak runoff by at least 96% if rainfall was less than 
40 mm (Hunt et al. 2008). Similarly, peak fow reduction by rain gardens was 51% 
for rainfall with a 2-year return period and it decreased to 24% for rainfalls with a 
5-year return period, demonstrating the importance of rainfall intensity in peak fow 
reduction (Dutta et  al. 2021). Three rain gardens with different features such as 
catchment area, size, media content, and vegetation are reported to decrease runoff 
volumes signifcantly by 54%, 51%, and 50% but struggled with volume and peak 
fow reduction for storm events >50 mm (Johnson and Hunt 2020). Rain gardens 
were found to manage stormwater better in areas with more sandy soils and in the 
K. Karabay et al.55
case of longer, lower-intensity rainfalls, regardless of soil composition (Bethke 
et al. 2021). Feldman et al. (2019) conducted a study in NYC and reported that 
retention was generally higher in the spring and summer, which was attributed to 
shorter storm durations with the same intensity. Also, the rain garden retained 
almost 96% of surface runoff in storm events with intensity smaller than 10 mm.
The role of vegetation on runoff volume reduction and peak fow delay was also 
assessed through studies. Johnston et al. (2020) investigated the effects of vegeta￾tion type on runoff retention in rain garden mesocosms and detected increased 
retention (>25%) of the stormwater compared to the non-planted control during 
regular 41 stormwater inputs over 7 months.
Flow through turfgrass was higher and water storage was lower, whereas reten￾tion in prairie was higher at a water fowrate similar to turfgrass. The most delayed 
fow and consequent highest water storage was observed in the case of shrub. 
Related to the higher water retention, shrub and prairie systems were more success￾ful at storing the largest number of rainfall events and minimized outfow when 
infows were small (≤50 mm). This was explained by the greater leaf area and root￾ing mass of these vegetations. Moreover, runoff drained almost 50% through sys￾tems vegetated with turfgrass and prairie faster and did not pond on the soil surface. 
On the other hand, infltration through shrub-vegetated or non-vegetated systems 
was decreased to 20–30% of total input which caused pooling of runoff on the soil 
surface. Changes in fow rates were determined only after precipitations over 90 mm 
and 75% drainage of the infuent, so difference in fowrate was not a direct function 
of infuent or effuent fow rate (Johnston et al. 2020). In another study, 12 feld￾scale rain gardens planted with prairie, shrub, and turfgrass were compared with 
unplanted rain gardens. During an analysis between July and September, drainage 
was 0–25%, 16–60%, 36–63%, and 60–76% through prairie, shrub, turfgrass, and 
bare soil, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that prairie provided the lowest 
drainage and potential recharge, whereas the highest drainage and recharge were 
observed in non-planted rain gardens (Nocco et al. 2016).
In terms of peak fow reduction performance, rain gardens were found to be less 
effective compared to fve other green infrastructure applications (green roof, swale, 
pervious surface, detention basin, and wetland) because rain gardens were found to 
decrease the peak fow by approximately 53% which was 61–97% for other applica￾tions (Xing et al. 2021). Indeed, Zhang et al. (2021) showed that the use of different 
LID practices linked in a suitable sequence (e.g., passing of the runoff through 
bioretention/pervious pavement, bio-swale, and rain garden in sequence before its 
fnal drainage into the municipal sewerage system) was more effective in reducing 
urban runoff and peak fow than unconnected dispersed LID practices. So, this 
would be a good choice in the design and construction of LID practices in urban 
areas for food control (Zhang et al. 2021).
Rain gardens provide infltration areas in the urban environment and prevent 
management of surface runoff. Infltration rate in rain gardens was determined in 
many feld studies, 2–160 cm/h, and it was found to change depending on soil type 
and measurement location (Guo et al. 2021; Jenkins et al. 2010; Kasprzyk et al. 
2022; Venvik and Boogaard 2020; Zhang et al. 2021). A study conducted in Ohio, 
4 Assessment of Urban Rain Gardens Within Climate Change Adaptation…56
USA, revealed that the rain garden reduces the incoming fow by 85%, even operat￾ing at the minimum recommended infltration rate of 0.635 cm/h (Jennings et al. 
2015). Additionally, Shuster et  al. (2017) compared the infltration and drainage 
rates in rain gardens and lawns and stated that the rain garden provided four times 
higher infltration rate and 100 times higher internal drainage rate (Shuster et al. 
2017). Moreover, hydraulic performance of the natural substrate in rain gardens 
constructed in Gdańsk was found to store 30 mm of rainfall to prevent fash fooding 
and drought mitigation (Kasprzyk et al. 2022). Zhang et al. (2021) observed that 
surface fooding which went through LID applications such as bioretention/pervi￾ous pavement, bio-swale and rain garden in sequence was fltrated completely, and 
no surface runoff was drained into the municipal sewage system in the Shenzhen 
region of China.
Clogging potential of the rain garden substrate is considered as the most critical 
issue of infltration through rain gardens. As an example, soil infltration rates mea￾sured during the construction of a rain garden were 22.4  cm/h on average 
(10.3–40.5 cm/h) and decreased slightly to 12 cm/h (1.2–21.2 cm/h) after 1 year 
(Trowsdale and Simcock 2011). On the contrary, sediment buildup in rain garden 
was found to be inconsistent and had not interfered with operation during the 8 years 
since installation (Jenkins et al. 2010). Similarly, Villanova operated the rain garden 
at an infltration rate of 0.64–1.3 cm/h without any measurable degradation in per￾formance for 7 years (Davis et al. 2009). So, there are examples where rain gardens 
were operated without any signifcant clogging.
Saturated hydraulic permeability is a parameter which is measured to assess the 
hydraulic performance of rain gardens. Paus et al. (2016) suggested that a rain gar￾den with a suffciently high saturated hydraulic conductivity (i.e. >10 cm/h) should 
be targeted (Paus et  al. 2016). According to another study, the recommended 
hydraulic permeability in bioretention media is 1.3–20 cm/h (Osman et al. 2019). 
Asleson et  al. (2009) observed different saturated hydraulic permeability in rain 
gardens based on the location. For example, the highest saturated hydraulic conduc￾tivity coeffcient was measured typically near shrubs and grasses (8.1 × 10−2
 cm/s) 
and the lowest one (5.5  ×  10−4
  cm/s) was measured near the garden entrance. 
Additionally, at points near low yielding trees and on the side slopes of the rain 
garden, hydraulic permeability tended to be higher (≥2.2 × 10−2
 cm/s), indicating 
that large and dense vegetation contributes to increase in hydraulic permeability 
values (Asleson et al. 2009). The impact of vegetation on enhancing hydraulic per￾meability was further studied by Johnston et  al. (2020). It was determined that 
shrubs and prairie plants with a higher root density increased the proportion of soil 
macropores to ensure free-draining soil water and increased saturated hydraulic per￾meability (Ks) of soil by as much as 25-fold compared to the control and turfgrass 
system. Additionally, the prairie and turfgrass rain garden mesocosms had an infl￾tration rate similar to the rate at which stormwater was applied (19.2 cm/h) prevent￾ing surface ponding. However, ponding on the soil surface for up to an hour was 
observed when inputs were >50 mm in mesocosms with shrub. This delayed infltra￾tion of stormwater resulted in subdued drainage response even though the shrub 
systems had the fastest average Ks. Therefore, it appeared that vegetation could 
K. Karabay et al.57
increase hydraulic permeability through their roots which provide channels for 
water fow (Johnston et al. 2020).
Hydraulic retention time is a very important indicator to assess the performance 
of the rain gardens, as well. It depends on the hydraulic permeability of the soil 
media and affects the fow reduction. For example, a peak fow reduction of 50–64% 
was provided by retention times of 26–37 minutes. Moreover, retention times of 
15–54 minutes were found to correspond to peak discharge reduction of 68–95% 
(Li et al. 2014). In addition, it was observed that a rain garden delayed the runoff by 
4.5 hours during the installation phase and 5.5 hours during the operation phase, 
helping to reduce peak fow (Shuster et al. 2017). Furthermore, experimental analy￾sis of the fow simulation helped to determine the average retention time of 
8–14  minutes in rain garden even though a constant fow rate was maintained 
(Fajardo-herrera et al. 2019). City of Portland Bureau of Environmental Services 
(2004) stated that the rain garden delayed the fow by 28 minutes where no outfow 
was recorded during the frst 16 minutes. Real-time monitoring was deployed to 
determine the lag time of rain garden drainage, and it appeared that peak fow could 
be delayed by 1.5-fold depending on rainfall size (6–13 minutes for rainfall intensi￾ties of 8–130 mm) and plant type (prairie, shrubs, and turfgrass) (Johnston et al. 
2020). Xing et  al. (2021) also demonstrated a peak fow delay between 1.5 and 
3.0 hours in their study.
4.3 Pollutant Treatment
In addition to its hydraulic benefts to the environment, rain gardens can serve to 
sustainability and climate change adaptations by pollutant removal ability. Urban 
runoff including many inorganic and organic pollutants can be treated by the soil 
media and plants that rain gardens have. As a result, groundwater pollution is pre￾vented. Moreover, retention of urban runoff prohibits transport of pollutants to the 
receiving water bodies by runoff.
A major portion of the studies about contaminant treatment in rain gardens inves￾tigated total suspended solid (TSS), nitrogen (N), and phosporus (P) removal. Rain 
gardens were estimated to reduce TSS more than 75 up to 99% (Davis et al. 2009; 
Dietz 2007; Roy-Poirier et  al. 2010; Spraakman et  al. 2020; Xing et  al. 2021; 
Yergeau and Obropta 2013). Jenkins et  al. (2010) measured the average TSS of 
143 mg/L at the inlet and 17 mg/L at the outlet. In another study, the average and 
maximum TSS concentrations measured at the rain garden inlet were 30–375 mg/L 
and 3–42  mg/L, respectively, at the exit of the garden (Trowsdale and Simcock 
2011). So, rain gardens could provide almost 90% TSS removal. On the other hand, 
there are studies reporting lower TSS removal such as 15% (Zhang et al. 2020) and 
14% (Dutta et al. 2021). The impact of vegetation on TSS removal did not seem to 
enhance TSS removal since rain garden areas with plants removed only 1% more 
TSS than rain garden areas without plants (Barrett et al. 2013).
4 Assessment of Urban Rain Gardens Within Climate Change Adaptation…58
Nitrogen removal effciency of rain gardens is estimated to be 30–97% (Davis 
et  al. 2009; Dietz 2007; Roy-Poirier et  al. 2010; Yergeau and Obropta 2013). 
Different removal rates of TN and TP was explained by difference in plant type, 
mulching, soil type, and rain garden depth. Actually, plants can take different 
amounts of nutrients from the soil for their development, depending on their spe￾cies. If removal of different forms of nitrogen were considered, rain gardens were 
found to reduce TN by 15–40% (Hunt et al. 2006, 2008; Xing et al. 2021), TKN by 
32–44% (Fajardo-herrera et al. 2019; Hunt et al. 2008), and NH3/NH4
+ by 70–88% 
(Hunt et al. 2008; Passeport et al. 2009). Nitrate could also be removed in rain gar￾dens during the anoxic conditions observed. For example, Spraakman et al. (2020) 
determined that NH3/NH4
+ concentrations were signifcantly reduced in the rain gar￾den, while NO3
− and NO2
− concentrations were not consistently reduced. This sug￾gests that both NO3
− and NO2
− production via aerobic ammonia nitrifcation occur 
in the rain garden, sometimes followed by denitrifcation under saturated condi￾tions. Additionally, another study found that the removal rate of NO3-N in the rain 
garden increased with increasing height of the ponding zone, and the removal rate 
of NO3-N was highest at 98% when the height was set to 60 cm (Xiong et al. 2020). 
Consequently, it is common to have rain gardens designed with an anaerobic zone 
to enhance nitrate removal. For example, while 75% nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) 
removal was observed in one of the rain gardens in this study with an anaerobic 
zone, this removal rate was 13% in another rain garden without an anaerobic zone 
(Hunt et al. 2006). Also, rain garden designed with an internal water storage (IWS) 
layer has increased the TN removal effciency in the traditional rain garden system 
from 18–54% to 91%. So, for increasing N removal and reducing the N2O emission 
potential, a rain garden with an IWS layer has been suggested (Wang et al. 2021). 
Studies conducted by Zhang et al. (2020) and Dutta et al. (2021) pointed out that 
differences in pollutant removal rates of different rain gardens with the same return 
period can be attributed to different conditions such as rainfall intensities.
Rain gardens were estimated to reduce total phosphorus (TP) by 11–85%, (Davis 
et al. 2009; Dietz 2007; Dutta et al. 2021; Roy-Poirier et al. 2010; Seo et al. 2017; 
Yergeau and Obropta 2013; Zhang et  al. 2020). Sharma and Malaviya (2021) 
reported total phosphorus removals of 70–85% in rain gardens for high and low 
permeability soil fltration media. Also, low permeability and high water retention 
time were found to support complexation and decrease P export. The frst fush 
effect expresses the situation when pollutant concentrations at the beginning are 
higher than that in the middle and later time of a rainfall event. Tang et al. (2020) 
found the frst fush effect was more signifcant for TN because the frst fush effect 
for TN was observed in 16 out of the 17 storms (94% of all rainfall events). On the 
other hand, the frst fush effect for TP was observed in 10 out of the 17 storms (71% 
of all rainfall events). These studies concluded that though high rainfall intensity 
may wash off more pollutants, the large amount of rainwater runoff caused by inten￾sive rainfall may dilute the pollutants. So, pollutant concentrations of rain water 
are the combined results of wash off and dilution effects. In another investigation, 
negative TP removal (−47%) was recorded for the rain garden (Xing et al. 2021). 
K. Karabay et al.59
The negative TP removal was related to the fact that phosphorus leaches from natu￾ral material in rain garden during rainwater infltration. There are other studies 
pointing out the possibility of leaching of N and P from rain garden. For example, 
mulching was found to affect the amount of N and P removal by Dietz (2007) and 
Vijayaraghavan et al. (2021). Moreover, after the installation, leaching from mulch 
and soil could result in increased nutrient concentration (Dietz 2007).
To increase the treatment service performance of rain gardens, soil substrate 
could be modifed to have a delayed saturation, low sorption capacity, limited pol￾lutant mobility, and bioaccumulation of metals or organic compounds (Sharma and 
Malaviya 2021). For example, addition of carbon substrate was found to enhance 
NO3
− removal up to 87% (Yang and Zhang 2011) and even up to 99% in another 
study (Randall and Bradford 2013). Extended saturated conditions inducing anoxic 
and anaerobic conditions were benefcial for N and P removal so N removal of over 
80% was observed under wetting regimes (Sharma and Malaviya 2021). Biphasic 
rain gardens were developed to provide saturated and unsaturated conditions simul￾taneously for improved treatment (Yang et al. 2013) and determined to be more 
effective for NO3
− removal (40–60%) compared to monophasic ones (29–39%) 
(Tang and Li 2016). Moreover, biphasic rain gardens were found successful to 
decrease dicamba, atrazine, 2,4-D around 90%, and glycophosphate about 99% 
from both agricultural and urban runoff events (Sharma and Malaviya 2021).
On the other hand, chloride concentration during non-snow events also increased 
from 42 mg/L to 344 mg/L from pre- to post-construction phases, suggesting likely 
leaching of chloride from mulch and soils (Alyaseri et al. 2017).
Another contaminant group commonly found in urban runoff is heavy metals. 
Rain gardens were able to reduce Cu (54–99%) (Frazier 2021; Hunt et al. 2006, 
2008), Pb (31–81%) (Hunt et al. 2006, 2008; Line and Hunt 2009; Xing et al. 2021), 
and Zn (77–98) (Hunt et al. 2006, 2008; Line and Hunt 2009). In addition, Trowsdale 
and Simcock (2011) studied the removal of total and dissolved Zn in the rain garden 
and found that total Zn removal (96%) was slightly higher than dissolved Zn 
removal (93%). Also, ≥90% of the heavy metals (e.g. Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu) removal 
observed in the top 25 cm of bioretention media (Sharma and Malaviya 2021).
Rain gardens were also reported to decrease pathogenic bacteria like E. coli
63–71% (Hunt et al. 2008; Youngblood et al. 2017), fecal coliform 69% (Hunt et al. 
2008), Enterococci 65%, and Coliphage 67% (Youngblood et al. 2017). In addition, 
Alyaseri et al. (2017) stated that despite the young age of the rain gardens, they may 
already be reducing the level of bacteria by 63%.
As an emerging contaminant, microplastics have been detected in urban runoff, 
as well. Rain water infltration systems with vegetation are regarded as very eff￾cient in capturing microplastics and preventing their spread into downstream envi￾ronments such that the average concentration of all microparticles, including 
microfbers, was reduced by 84%, and their load was reduced by more than 92% 
(Smyth et al. 2021).

4.4 Carbon Footprint
In addition to other benefts they provide, rain gardens have also been regarded as 
NbS that contribute to carbon footprint reduction and carbon sequestration. Rain 
gardens increase green space and soil richness, ensure carbon sequestration through 
storing CO2 in plants or soil, and indirectly or directly reduce CO2 and carbon foot￾print (Kavehei et al. 2018a). A study about reduction in CO2 emission compared 
rain gardens and sand, and it was seen that the CO2 emission of rain gardens was 
30% less compared to sand flters (Andrew and Vesely 2008). Moore and Hunt 
(2013) also compared rain gardens and sand flters in terms of carbon emissions and 
carbon sequestration. According to the study, carbon emissions from rain gardens 
during the installation were 21.5 kg CO2 m−2
, while the carbon sequestration was 
19 kg CO2 m−2
. On the other hand, installation of sand flter caused 240 kg CO2-C 
m−2
 carbon emission while providing no carbon fx. Therefore, net carbon release 
from rain garden was 2.5 kg CO2-C m−2
 and from sand flter was 240 kg CO2-C m−2
. 
Results demonstrated that rain gardens were preferable due to both lower emissions 
during the installation phase and higher carbon capture. Additionally, it was proved 
that rain gardens established in Ohio reduced CO2 emissions by 60% by carbon 
sequestration as a result of increased green areas (Vineyard et al. 2015).
Furthermore, decreasing carbon emissions is associated with a reduction in car￾bon footprint. Kavehei et al. (2018a) found that the carbon embodied in the initial 
establishment constitutes 41% of the carbon footprint of the rain gardens because of 
transportation during installation. The carbon footprint of a rain garden over a 
30-year period was predicted to vary between 13.9 kg CO2 eq. m−2
 (Vineyard et al. 
2015) to a maximum of 138.9 kg CO2 eq. m−2
 (Flynn and Traver 2013) ignoring its 
carbon sequestration. On the other hand, the carbon sequestration potential of a rain 
garden considering natural systems was estimated between −144 kg CO2 eq. m−2
(Flynn and Traver 2013) and −7.1 kg CO2 eq. m−2
 (Cameron et al. 2012) in a 30-year 
period. Considering this data, Kavehei et al. (2018a) concluded that the average 
carbon footprint of rain gardens was calculated to be −75.5 ± 68.4 kg CO2 eq. m−2
over 30 years, which revealed the potential of rain gardens to completely balance 
the carbon emissions. As a result, rain gardens have the lowest net carbon footprint 
among other NbS. To evaluate the circularity potential of rain gardens, Flynn and 
Traver (2013) compared the carbon footprint of end-of-life scenarios of materials 
used in rain gardens after destruction. Global warming potential was estimated as 
134 kg CO2 eq in case the rain garden media is reused, whereas this value was cal￾culated as 51,291 kg CO2 eq when the media was disposed.
Chan et al. (2018) investigated the effects of plant varieties used in rain gardens 
in Hong Kong on carbon sequestration in the case of plants that were used to replace 
fossil fuel. The carbon fnal carbon stock was calculated as 0.5 kg/m2
 in grasses and 
26.8 kg/m2
 in trees among seven herbs, seven shrubs, and six tree types studied. 
This result was interpreted as the negligible contribution from grasses to carbon 
sequestration. Although carbon sequestration of the trees was higher than shrubs, 
trees were estimated to reach the maximum carbon sequestration in 20  years, 
K. Karabay et al.61
whereas shrubs could reach the highest level in 5–8  years. Therefore, planting 
shrubs with lower carbon sequestration but faster growth was determined to be a 
better scenario compared to planting trees with a higher carbon sequestration but 
slower growth in terms of carbon fxing. Overall, modeling results proposed that 
carbon stock in rain gardens could be elevated from 0 to 3 kg/m2
 by optimizing the 
growth capacity and carbon sequestration potential of the plant. Additionally, in the 
presence of trees in rain gardens, annual carbon sequestration and annual carbon 
removal were calculated as 490 kg C and 90 kg C, respectively (Flynn and Traver 
2013). Consequent annual global warming potential avoidance was calculated as 
1943 kg CO2 eq.
4.5 Biodiversity
One of the most important services of rain garden as an NbS is to contribute to bio￾diversity, which plays a very critical role during the period of climate change. Rain 
gardens can support the development of birds, insects, wildlife, and plants. It was 
seen that rain gardens often host worms, ants, snails, and spiders (Mehring and 
Levin 2015). Looking at the literature, it can be said that the transition from tradi￾tional green areas to rain gardens increases the biodiversity in cities. For example, 
for the 84 plant species examined, number of species and species richness in rain 
gardens were 2–4 times more compared to gardenbed-type green areas and lawn￾type green areas, respectively (Kazemi et al. 2009). Additionally, a rain garden with 
water-resistant plants and birdhouses, mangers, and feeding stations for animals 
was established in an area of 310 m2
 in a primary school garden in Shanghai. Here, 
rain garden was found to result in a 220%, 66.7%, 57.1%, 50%, and 50% increase 
in fowers and fruit trees, molluscs, insects, chilopods, and birds, respectively (Yan 
2021). Another study selected fve different rain gardens in Gdansk, Poland, where 
the number of plant species and individual plants were known (Kasprzyk et  al. 
2022). Biodiversity was evaluated through indicators such as Shannon evenness 
index (sign of a rain garden resistant against urban challenges and balanced in eco￾system services) and Shannon Diversity index (species diversity in a given area). It 
was found that rain gardens with an evenness index of 0.84–0.96 increased biodi￾versity by creating very comfortable areas for many animal and plant species and 
improving stormwater quality.
4.6 Ecosystem Services
NbS are preferred because they can provide many ecosystem services which are 
vital for sustainability. For example, they can support nutrient cycle, photosynthe￾sis, soil formation, regulate air quality, climate, water resources, erosion control, 
water treatment, pest control, pollination, food control, supply raw materials, 
4 Assessment of Urban Rain Gardens Within Climate Change Adaptation…62
medicine content, food, and fresh water and contribute to education, well-being, 
aesthetics, and recreation for the society (Song et al. 2020).
As already discussed in detail in the previous sections, rain gardens have a sig￾nifcant capacity for rain water catchment and infltration into soil (Autixier et al. 
2014; Chaffn et al. 2016; Pataki et al. 2011). In fact, in addition to infltration and 
retention of stormwater, purifcation is considered as the third primary function of a 
rain garden since they can remove pollutants like TSS, COD, as well as nutrients 
(TP, NO3-N, NH4, NH3, and TN) and heavy metals like Cu and Zn (Lu and Wang 
2021; Yang et al. 2010, 2013). Therefore, it can be concluded that rain gardens are 
functional to provide ecosystem services by controlling food, protecting water 
resources from combined sewer overfow, treating water, and providing fresh water 
(Yang et al. 2015).
Climate regulation is one of the ecosystem services of rain gardens and decreases 
the impact of climate change through reducing carbon emissions and capturing car￾bon in the soil media. Over 30 years, bioretention basins are thought to have a 70% 
potential to reduce carbon emissions (Kavehei et al. 2018a; Kavehei et al. 2018b). 
Also, the results of an investigation about temporal and vertical variations in carbon 
capture in 25 subtropical rain gardens aged 2–13 indicated that the top 20 cm of the 
soil profle appeared to have a discernible age infuence on carbon density, where 
carbon sequestration was 0.31  kg C m2
 year−1
. Carbon sequestration developed 
quickly in the frst 5 cm of the layer, whereas deeper levels showed slower carbon 
synthesis. Moreover, the results show that lower soil density is related to the rela￾tively high C stocks of the top soil layer (Kavehei et al. 2019).
Rain gardens also provide raw materials through harvesting of the plants grown 
in the garden. (Yuan et al. 2022). Certain plant species employed to collect runoff 
from catchments and soil ecosystems developed in the soil media were also benef￾cial for biodiversity (Davis and McCuen 2005; Kavehei et  al. 2019). In a study 
examining the environmental and economic values of permeable pavement, bio￾fltration press, plant microbial fuel cell system, and rain gardens in terms of water, 
energy, and food, the results showed that NbS create new opportunities for food and 
energy production, as well as cultural services. The highest physical and economic 
beneft was obtained from rain gardens (15 million/year) (Yuan et al. 2022).
4.7 Groundwater Recharge
Another important contribution of rain gardens to urban circularity is their help to 
recharge groundwater due to its fltering properties (Aravena and Dussaillant 2009; 
Singh 2019; Venvik and Boogaard 2020) and prevent groundwater pollution 
(Kasprzyk et al. 2022). By creating permeable surfaces, rain gardens play a signif￾cant role in improvement of the water cycle in urban areas (Job 2022; Kasprzyk 
et al. 2022).
According to international guidelines, rain gardens can leak rain water at a rate 
of 100–300 mm/s. To study the infltration capacity of small scale rain gardens and 
K. Karabay et al.63
infer the impact on groundwater level, wells were drilled at certain distances. An 
immediate increase (35–42 cm) in the groundwater level was observed in wells at 
locations closer than 30 m from the rain garden, whereas it took almost 2 days in the 
wells 75–100 m far from the rain garden for the groundwater level to increase by 
20–25 cm (Venvik and Boogaard 2020).
Another study about the groundwater recharge potential of permeable pavement 
and a rain garden site was carried out in Taipei, Taiwan, and found that rain gardens 
induced a delayed increase in the groundwater table compared to permeable pave￾ment because of the thick soil layer. In addition, model results showed that infltra￾tion was 15.9%, where 16% of the area was green, and 23.1% when 36% of the area 
was permeable pavement elevated to 91.4% when rain garden was built on 16% of 
the area (Chen et al. 2022).
4.8 Heat Island Effects
By lowering heat storage on urban surfaces and raising evapotranspiration, green 
spaces in urban areas are regarded as a successful technique to reduce the impacts 
of urban heat islands (Imran et al. 2019). For instance, especially in heat wave peri￾ods, the temperature near urban areas was 12 °C higher than the temperature in 
green forest areas (Davis and McCuen 2005). In a study examining the cooling 
effects of green areas, it was observed that the cooling diameter was 300–400 m in 
the case of green area of size 100–400 m2
 (Imran et al. 2019). Kasprzyk et al. (2022) 
studied the heat island situation with remote sensing. It was observed that the tem￾peratures measured in the rain gardens were 3.5 °C lower than the playground and 
7 °C lower than the parking lot. Moreover, the surface temperature of the rain gar￾den was 7 °C lower than the surroundings in cloudy weather, while this difference 
reached up to 20 °C in sunny weather. Generally, it is proposed that green areas like 
rain gardens decrease heat island effect by increasing air humidity (Oral et al. 2021). 
According to Chapman et al. (2022), rain gardens were the second contributor of 
evapotranspiration following the turfgrass area (2.9–4 mm), and this high evapo￾transpiration was related to reducing heat island development.
4.9 Cost Beneft
The cost and economic benefts of rain gardens have gained relatively limited atten￾tion compared to other benefts of rain gardens. Economical benefts of rain gardens 
could be predicted by calculating avoided costs from possible foods and from 
stormwater treatment (Siwiec et al. 2018). Nine green infrastructures in Michigan 
were considered to calculate capital, operation, and maintenance costs to reduce 
around 85 m2
 runoff (Nordman et al. 2018). The cost of green infrastructures was 
found to be 11–29% more expensive than traditional infrastructures. However, the 
4 Assessment of Urban Rain Gardens Within Climate Change Adaptation…64
highest beneft of rain gardens originated from reduction in TSS pollution as 1.37$/ 
m3
 water quality volume (WQv) per year and an increase in amenity value as 1.20$/ 
m3
 WQv /year in addition to decrease in TP pollution and food risk. The increase in 
amenity value was explained by the fact that the average value of the houses 50 m 
away from the rain gardens were reported to increase by 6%. Adding land prices to 
the costs and standardizing based on WQv, the net present value was found to be 
36.87$/m3
. Estimations indicated that rain gardens can pay off and even proft. In 
conclusion, rain gardens were found to be attractive due to low investment and 
operation costs. Indeed, it was stated that these costs could be reduced if rain gar￾dens were not implemented by professional frms. At the same time, the positive net 
present value even in the worst scenario highlighted that rain gardens are less vul￾nerable. Moreover, in a modeling study (Cohen et al. 2012), the cost of gray infra￾structure was compared with the cost of gray infrastructure coupled with rain 
garden, aiming to reduce combined sewer overfow. Integration of rain gardens into 
gray infrastructure lowered the cost over a 50-year period from $385 million to 
$350–363 million (in case 24,506–51,822 rain gardens were installed) where the 
number of rain gardens was also found feasible. In terms of fnal decision about soil 
media, Flynn and Traver (2013) revealed that reusing rain garden soil media costed 
$5544, whereas disposal of media costed $5994 in 2001, showing that reuse of soil 
media was a better option in terms of both environment and cost.
Heidari et al. (2022) stated that cost assessment of rain gardens should not be 
limited to operation and maintenance costs only because of their strong potential to 
reduce the cost of nutrient removal compared to other green infrastructures. Another 
study supporting and expanding this statement (Law et  al. 2017) predicted that 
increasing green infrastructure including rain gardens in Pennsylvania would reduce 
stormwater management costs by $51.6 million over 25  years, energy costs by 
$2.37 million/year, air pollution management costs by $1 million/year, and CO2
reduction costs by $786,000. Furthermore, it was reported that rain gardens collect￾ing stormwater and fltrating runoff reduced the annual water service fee from $60 
to $0 and the stormwater discharge fee from $250 to $0. Also, before construction 
of the rain garden, the cost of rain water discharge into the sewer contained a fee 
payment of 220 €/year. So, with the rain garden achieving an average of 82% runoff 
volume reduction, considerable savings on sewer network construction could be 
achieved by the city, offsetting the missed income from discharge fees (Boguniewicz￾Zabłocka and Capodaglio 2020).
4.10 Limitation and Challenges
Having the benefts of mitigating the impacts of climate change and urban circular￾ity challenges, on the one hand, rain gardens also have some limitations. According 
to a research that looked at urban ecosystem services under four different 
K. Karabay et al.65
governance types (adaptive governance, mosaic governance, networked gover￾nance, and transformative governance), six small-scale urban green infrastructures 
(UGI) have a variety of benefts. The results of the study show that the demand for 
rain gardens by people who are planners and owners is decreasing as they can be 
expensive to set up and maintain. (Razzaghi Asl and Pearsall 2022).
One of the most important technical restrictions about rain gardens is that they 
are not appropriate for rainfall with high return periods (Ekmekcioğlu et al. 2021). 
That is, the rain garden has limited capacity to decrease runoff volume, especially 
in climate change scenarios. For this reason, the rain garden cannot replace gray 
infrastructure but should be integrated with them (Wang et al. 2019b).
Another situation that causes problems in the operation of rain gardens is the fne 
particles that come with rain water can cause clogging in the soil environment and 
thus reduce the infltration rate of rain garden (Sharma and Malaviya 2021; Stander 
and Borst 2010). Similarly, according to Johnson and Hunt (2020), runoff volume 
reduction was observed in the rain gardens because of the high percentage of fne 
particles (62% silt and 13% clay) existing in the flter media.
Moreover, some operational decisions that result in overusing compost, fertilizer, 
irrigation, or other common landscaping techniques, especially when the planted 
species are not well suited to a rain garden’s conditions, can accelerate the nutrient 
accumulation in the rain garden media and raise the contaminant concentrations in 
the stormwater that passes through the rain garden (Hurley et al. 2017; Taguchi et al. 
2020). In addition, the vegetation in the rain garden can become diseased and die 
over time. In order to prevent this, accumulated sediments and dead plants must be 
removed regularly (Sharma and Malaviya 2021).
Stagnant water in rain gardens is considered as another challenge since it might 
cause accidental drowning, serve as a breeding area for various insects such as mos￾quitoes, attract creatures such as rodents, raccoons, and opossums, and cause 
groundwater pollution if it is not separated from the groundwater table (Anderson 
et al. 2018; Sharma and Malaviya 2021).
Looking at the disadvantages observed in terms of pollutant removal, it was seen 
that salt in rain water disrupts the capability of soils to remove metals, especially for 
Zn-contaminated rain water (Costello et al. 2020). Besides, it is very important to 
understand that metals do not biodegrade and only adsorb on soil media. Therefore, 
heavy metals in surface runoff are not treated but only change phase and shift the 
pollution risk from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems. In fact, higher soil metal con￾centrations were seen in old rain gardens (Ekmekcioğlu et al. 2021).
In a study, heavy metals associated with resuspended road dust particles from 
LID construction sites were analyzed (Ma et al. 2020). According to the results, the 
maximum amount of road dust from the construction of the rain gardens was pro￾duced during the excavation phase and reached levels 41.92 times higher than the 
relevant background values. So, suitable precautions should be taken to remove 
road dust during LID construction such as increasing the road cleaning frequency 
and covering the exposed area with geotextile.
4 Assessment of Urban Rain Gardens Within Climate Change Adaptation…66
4.11 Conclusions
Rain gardens can be implemented as NbS to provide various adaptations to both 
climate change and urban circularity challenges. The most well-known and docu￾mented beneft of rain gardens is detention and infltration of surface runoff. The 
resulting reduced outfow reaching sewer systems eliminates the possibility of sys￾tem failure and spreading of untreated wastewater. Therefore, rain gardens could be 
regarded as a useful NbS to respond to increased food risks in cities caused by cli￾mate change and urbanization. Furthermore, enhanced infltration can address water 
shortages due to climate change and urbanization. Thus, rain gardens serve to main￾tain the natural water cycle, save a valuable fresh water source, groundwater from 
depletion, and overcome an important urban circularity challenge.
In addition to managing stormwater quantitatively, rain gardens are also effcient 
in improving water quality, which is defned as another urban circularity challenge. 
Common contaminants found in urban runoff like suspended solids, nitrogen, phos￾phorus, heavy metals, and pathogens are effciently removed where treatment of 
some other microcontaminants like microplastics, pesticides, and PAHs is possible. 
Attention was drawn to the fact that heavy metals are not actually treated but only 
transferred from water to soil media, so the contamination load of soil needs to be 
considered.
Plants are determined to be an important component of rain gardens, increasing 
hydraulic permeability, treating contaminants, sequestering carbon, decreasing heat 
island effect, and providing biodiversity and many other ecosystem services such as 
photosynthesis, air quality regulation, pollination, and aesthetics.
With the growing need to decrease greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the 
impacts of climate change, carbon sequestration has become very essential. Rain 
gardens are NbS with a smaller carbon footprint since they fx carbon by plants and 
soil. Additionally, carbon emissions of rain gardens are mainly due to transport, so 
using local materials can minimize the carbon footprint of rain gardens signifcantly. 
Similar to water cycle, biodiversity is indispensable for circularity and sustainabil￾ity, but it is threatened severely by climate change and urbanization. Rain gardens 
could support biodiversity functionally by accommodating several species like 
birds, insects, plants, molluscs, and chilopods. Although indisputable contributions 
to food control and water treatment, there are also other ecosystem services that 
rain gardens provide like erosion control, pest control, raw material supply, educa￾tion, and recreation. As green areas in cities, they promote cooler areas to prevent 
urban heat island effect, which is a signifcant adaptation to climate change and 
circularity. Cost benefts of rain gardens can be estimated by the cost saved by 
avoidance of foods, water contamination, and stormwater fee. The main limitation 
of rain gardens is that they cannot handle precipitation heavier than 20–50 mm. 
Therefore, they are not effective as an individual application but could be very ben￾efcial if used in a combination with other NbS. Clogging of soil media and mainte￾nance of plants are defned as points that need careful operation. Moreover, if the 
rain garden does not drain fast enough, and stagnant water pools in the rain garden, 
it might cause smell and attract mosquitos which in turn reduce the social acceptance.

The Employment of Rain Gardens 
in Urban Water Management to Improve 
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Resilience
Makbulenur Onur
Abstract The planet has managed the water cycle for centuries. However, the com￾plex and advanced technologies developed by humans introduced several innova￾tions that their survival depends on, which in turn destroyed the natural system, 
especially the water cycle. As a result, the smooth functioning of natural cycles 
could not be sustained. Certain water management applications have been proposed 
to resolve this problem. The aim of this chapter is to determine the benets of rain 
gardens for ecosystem resilience, biodiversity, and water management/economy, the 
correlations between these factors based on a measurable method, and to design and 
develop a sustainable model proposal. In the study, previous studies were reviewed, 
and alternative criteria clusters were developed. Various statistical and graphical 
analyses were conducted on these criteria. The signicant parameters in rain garden 
design were determined with the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method, and 
these parameters were compared. A decision-making mechanism was developed 
with the AHP method. Based on the study’s ndings, a sustainable rain garden 
design model was proposed.

5.1 Introduction
Water, which is the basic source of life for millions of living beings on earth, is 
accepted as a strategic resource in the future by all (Pamuk Mengü and Akkuzu 
2008). The excessive water consumption and the destruction of freshwater habitats 
led to several problems, including climate change (WWF 2019; Atanasova et al.

Urban Water, Circular Economy and Sustainability, 
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-50725-0_574
2021). Problems in the water cycle led to high air temperatures that affected water 
quality and obstructed the access of individuals and ecosystems to fresh water in 
coastal areas (CSB 2018; Kim et al. 2021).
The scarcity of water resources is among the most important challenges in the 
twenty-frst century. Sustainability of water resources is the leading factor for sev￾eral issues such as food and energy security, economic growth, climate change, and 
loss of biodiversity. If all the water on Earth were put in a 5-L bottle, the fresh water 
that humans can access would be merely one tablespoon. In other words, the amount 
of accessible fresh water is less than 1% of the global water resources (Pamuk 
Mengü and Akkuzu 2008; WWF 2019; CSB 2018; Kim et al. 2021).
The presence of suffcient and high-quality water is the basic requirement of 
freshwater ecosystems, as well as food security and sustainable development; and 
thus, the future of humanity. Therefore, limited water resources or excessive con￾sumption of water are among the most signifcant global problems. Preservation of 
freshwater resources is a common global problem (WWF 2019). It was expected 
that these problems would include lower and shorter precipitation when compared 
to previous years. On the other hand, an increase in precipitation could lead to 
foods (IPCC 2016).
Water quality and quantity will deteriorate due to foods and droughts. It is pre￾dicted that human health and ecosystems will be adversely affected (IPCC 2016). 
Several ecological approaches have been proposed to solve the abovementioned 
problems (Gulpinar Sekban and Acar 2021). Today, sustainable development plans 
are developed with the nature-based solutions (NbS), vertical greening systems 
(Castellar et al. 2020), green roofs (GRs) (Poórová and Vranayová 2019; Bianchini 
and Hewage 2012), low-impact development (LID) (Dietz 2007; Ahiablame et al. 
2012), and sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) (Zhou 2014; McClymont et  al. 
2020; Pappalardo and La Rosa 2020) approach that provides signifcant cost￾effective methods to avoid structural interventions (Sahani et al. 2019). Furthermore, 
there is strong scientifc evidence on the contribution of NbS to natural life, and 
several studies recommend the employment of the method at various scales (Keesstra 
et al. 2018).
Thus, NbS are proven to be effective in the reduction of the pressure on nature 
with urban management and nature-oriented approaches (Escobedo et  al. 2019; 
Kalantari et al. 2019; Meshram et al. 2021; Ramírez-Agudelo et al. 2020). The most 
signifcant application developed for this purpose includes “rain gardens” (Bekar 
et  al. 2020; Dietz 2005). Rain gardens are landscaped depressions where grass, 
fowers, and various plants are cultivated to collect rainwater from rooftops or 
streets, enabling the rainwater to seep into the ground. Rain gardens could also flter 
pollutants in the fow and provide nutrients and shelter for butterfies, songbirds, 
and other wildlife (USEPA 2014a, b). Rainwater harvesting and storage for later use 
is a technique that has been employed for thousands of years (Kloss 2008). 
Engineering and technological developments started in the 1990s. Rain gardens 
were originally developed by Maryland in Prince George’s County in the 1990s. 
The rationale of the garden was based on a form of biological containment that 
includes a sloped landmass at a source downstream (Roy-Poirier et al. 2010).
M. Onur75
The management of rainwater with “rain gardens” has been implemented on 
many scales around the world. There are several examples where biodiversity has 
improved by the harvesting and storage of rainwater with micro-scale water harvest 
methods. For example, in Seattle’s urban landscape, 185 million liters of water are 
recycled with rainwater management. The project aimed to manage the rainwater 
and surface runoff with the employment of green urban infrastructure (PAD 2017; 
GIS 2021). On a smaller scale, successful rainwater management was implemented 
in Tanner Spring Park. The Tanner Spring Park water-holding area was built to hold 
rainwater in 0.92 ha. In the park, instead of discharging the rainwater with drainage 
pipes, the water is fltered by plants (PAD 2017). The sponge city strategy, imple￾mented as a model in the New Longhua District, streamlined water management. 
Thus, rainwater fows slowly downstream and eventually reaches the urban environ￾ment and the eco-net (PAD 2017; Landscape Record 2015). The smallest scale 
implementation is the Pocket Park in Utrecht, Netherlands. The pocket park retains 
water during heavy rains. It was designed as a collection and storage area for use 
during periods without precipitation. Rainwater is directed from the roofs of the 
surrounding buildings to the reserve via the gutters and drainage pipes and collected 
in the water reservoir. It is used as an amphitheater when it is empty. The crops of 
local farmers are irrigated with the rainwater collected in this reservoir (PAD 2017). 
The abovementioned examples are just a few of the previous applications. According 
to the experts, rain gardens, one of the most successful practices to eliminate the 
scarcity of water, could be considered an urban lifesaver. Bekar et al., in a study 
conducted in a campus in 2020 (Bekar et al. 2020), revealed that the rain garden 
proposed by the authors would save signifcant economic costs for the university in 
the short term. The study revealed that the right application of the rain gardens 
would amortize the costs and yield a proft in a short time.
The gardens constructed in shallow pits that collect untreated rainwater to grow 
plants are called rain gardens. The system is a rational, strategic, and easy applica￾tion based on the principle of the prevention of rainwater loss with ground fow and 
to allow the rainwater to penetrate the soil at the location of precipitation (USEPA 
2014a, b). Also known as a bioretention or bioretention cell, a rain garden collects 
runoff from the roofs, streets, sidewalks, and other impermeable surfaces, leading 
the water to a shallow, plant-covered pond. Often, rooted native plants and herbs are 
planted in rain gardens to maximize rainwater penetration (Keys 2015).
5.2 Rain Garden Design Principles
Several reasons such as unplanned urbanization, including complex demands of 
urbanization, environmental degradation, etc. led to the spread of impermeable sur￾faces and serious rainwater problems (URL-1; Pille and Säumel 2021; Maksimovic 
and Tejada-Guibert 2001). The development of holistic rainwater drainage strate￾gies is required when rainwater volume increases in surface fow, rainwater fow 
decreases, urban areas are exposed to foods and overfows, water that reaches the 
5 The Employment of Rain Gardens in Urban Water Management to Improve…76
groundwater, and quality of surface water decreases (URL-1). Several design 
approaches have been implemented for this purpose. These approaches contribute 
to the concept of sustainability. It was suggested that sustainability is the most sig￾nifcant approach to ensure the well-being of future generations (Bayramoğlu and 
Demirel 2016; Kasim and Scarlat 2007). However, individuals’ desire for the built 
environment has sometimes misled this concept. Hospitals consume large volumes 
of water in recreational facilities such as pools, spas, fountains, ornamental pools, 
and landscape irrigation (Kasim and Scarlat 2007; Müftüoglu and Perçin 2015; 
Mala et al. 2020). These are only a few examples of dysfunctional water consump￾tion. Urbanization is also a part of this consumption trend. The impact of urbaniza￾tion on the rainwater cycle is presented in Fig.  5.1. The rainwater discharge to 
surface fow is around 10% in rural areas, while the same is 55% in urban centers. 
The direct discharge of rainwater to rivers increases fooding and overfows. The 
destruction of the natural cycle of water has introduced several problems. Rainwater 
discharge to the surface fow leads to signifcant pollution, which in turn pollutes the 
receiving environment, namely the drinking water resources. The serious decrease 
in the water volume that reaches the groundwater reduces the drinking water supply. 
Due to the increase in impermeable surfaces, pipe diameter has been increased to 
collect the rainwater in the surface fow, leading to signifcant construction and 
maintenance costs (URL-1; Mala et al. 2020).
Bioretention areas are similar to rain gardens; however, the latter are highly engi￾neered to include an underdrain, overfow inlet, gravel bed, and engineered soil to 
promote infltration (USEPA 2014a, b; Mala et al. 2020). More complex rain gar￾dens with drainage systems and replaced soil are often called biological retention 
cells (USEPA 2014a, b).
Fig. 5.1 The impact of urbanization on rainwater cycle
M. Onur77
The rain garden slows the runoff and provides a chance for retention of the runoff 
by the soil. Once permeated into the soil, the water is absorbed by the surface plants 
or may seep deeper into the soil and eventually fnds its way into the groundwater 
or nearby streams.
The soil is frst dug, mixed with organic matter and sand, and the original pit is 
flled. To prevent water pooling for longer than 24–48 h, certain rain gardens are 
constructed to include a tile drainage system at the bottom of the garden (Lancaster 
2008; PAD 2017). Generally, rain gardens include three zones (Fig. 5.2).
Rain harvest entails all methods developed to collect and consume the surface 
fow of precipitation, as an alternative to the employment of unsustainable ground￾water in irrigation and domestic use. Rain harvest has several ecological and recre￾ational benefts such as the improvement of the soil, groundwater discharge, 
agricultural production, and productivity in times of drought, allowing the repro￾duction of fsh and plants in the ponds and developing a habitat for waterfowls, with 
side benefts such as complementary food forest and increase in ground cover and 
organic soil content (PAD 2017; RHS 2021).
Fig. 5.2 Rain garden layers
5 The Employment of Rain Gardens in Urban Water Management to Improve…78
Rain gardens constructed on the principle of “recycling” the rainwater could 
have several benefts. In the present study, these benefts are grouped into three sec￾tions: “ecosystem resilience, biodiversity, and water management/economy.” These 
categories were determined based on the literature review. The reason for choosing 
these criteria is these are among the most mentioned benefts of rain gardens in the 
literature. These parameters used are among the most basic benefts. For this reason, 
the parameters are given priority (Table 5.1).
5.3 Research Objective
Rain gardens/bioretention systems, which aim to provide an alternative to tradi￾tional water management, are among the solutions to the increasing pressures on 
water supply. The common objective of these methods is to resolve the current pres￾sures on the “water cycle.” It has been demonstrated in several studies that these 
problems are not limited to nations or cities but led to global problems. Thus, doz￾ens of studies have been conducted on rain gardens. However, most were theoretical 
studies where the implementation stages and benefts of rain gardens were dis￾cussed. The present study aims to emphasize the necessity of rain gardens and asso￾ciated design strategies. A different grouping approach was adopted to provide an 
alternative to the studies in the literature (ER, B, WME). Furthermore, unlike previ￾ous studies, the benefts of rain gardens were analyzed statistically. As a result, a 
model that depended on statistically signifcant parameters was proposed. Thus, the 
study aims to achieve several objectives with this method:
• To determine the benefts of rain gardens for “ecosystem resilience (ER), biodi￾versity, and water management/economy”.
• To provide a measurement of the signifcance of rain gardens for biodiversity, 
ecosystem resilience, and water management.
• To determine the signifcant parameters based on the comparison of the above￾mentioned benefts.
• To propose a novel model based on a statistical method and the parameters that 
were considered prevalent in previous studies.
5.4 The Research Method
The methodology included three stages: (1) the determination of the rain garden 
parameters that affect ecosystem resilience, biodiversity, and water management/
economy; (2) statistical method – analytical hierarchical process (AHP); and (3) the 
development of a sample design based on the frst- and second-stage fndings 
(Fig. 5.3).

Fig. 5.3 The study fowchart
All stages were implemented consecutively, and each stage was based on the 
previous one. In stage 1, the criteria were developed based on the literature review, 
and in the second stage, the correlations between these criteria were measured with 
statistical methods. Based on the data collected in these two stages, a design pro￾posal was developed in the fnal stage. The study fowchart is presented in Fig. 5.3.
5.4.1 The First Stage, Determination of the Parameters
In the present study, a comprehensive literature review was conducted on rain gar￾dens. The literature review revealed the 24 most discussed benefts of rain gardens 
for ecosystem resilience (ER), biodiversity (B), water management/economy 
(WME) were selected (Table 5.2) (USEPA 2010, 2014a, b; URL-1, CSB 2018; RHS 
2021; Turkelboom et  al. 2021; Sevimli 2021; Tundisi and Tundisi 2016). These 
benefts were coded as 24 parameters, and 3 main criteria and 24 sub-criteria were 
determined (Table 5.2).
5.4.2 The Second Stage, Statistical Analysis
In the second stage, the statistical methodology was employed to determine the 
correlations between the criteria identifed in the literature review. The main prob￾lem encountered in multi-criteria decision-making problems is the determination 
of the weight, signifcance or superiority of the alternative criteria during the cri￾teria selection. Since AHP is a powerful method for solving this problem, it was 
employed in the present study (Gülenç and Aydin Bilgin 2010; Dağdeviren and 
Yüksel 2008) (Fig. 5.3).
AHP assists individuals or groups to make decisions under complex circum￾stances. In the analysis, a hierarchy of criteria, in other words, a decision model, 
was developed initially (Fig. 5.4). In the model, the highest hierarchy included the

“objective” (rain garden in urban water management). This was followed by the 
three “criteria” or “alternatives,” developed based on the literature review (ecosys￾tem resilience, biodiversity, and water management/economy). Alternatives were 
categorized into three groups based on the literature review. The solution path was 
determined by the AHP in the criterion groups. AHP analysis determines the promi￾nence of the 24 scale criteria based on the criterion weight.

Fig. 5.4 Criteria matrix chart
After the hierarchy was determined, the comparative parameters were identifed. 
In other words, the pairwise comparison was employed to determine the relative 
signifcance of the items in the hierarchy when compared to the items in the next 
level. The decision-maker could employ the scale scored between 1 and 9 points to 
determine the paired comparison parameters. In other words, the signifcance of 
criterion A could be determined when compared to the criterion B (Palaz et  al. 
2008). This is the numerical stage where expert opinion is obtained. The criteria are 
compared with the other criteria and all alternatives Dağdeviren and Eren (2001) to 
determine the differences (Dağdeviren and Eren 2001).
5.4.3 The Third Stage, the Design of “the Sample 
Rain Garden”
In the frst and second stages, the main parameters and the sub-parameters were 
determined based on literature review and statistical analysis. A sample rain garden 
was designed based on these parameters. The design prioritized decision-making 
that would emphasize the abovementioned parameters. The design is discussed 
based on the layers. The parameters determined with the statistical method were 
designed within the layers.
5.5 Findings
The present study fndings are presented based on the procedures detailed in the 
methodology section: the development of parameters, AHP analysis results, and 
sample rain garden design.

5.5.1 AHP Analysis Findings
The numerical AHP analysis results are presented in Table 5.3. The same numerical 
data are schematized in Figs. 5.5 and 5.6.
The AHP analysis results for the ecosystem resilience criteria demonstrated that 
the highest weight was observed in “ER1 – reduction of the urban heat island effect 
(.422)” criterion. This was followed by the “ER2 – allowing the penetration of rain￾water to groundwater by pooling (.115)” and “ER3 – preservation of hydrological 
functions in urban areas (.089)” criteria. The lowest weight was observed in the 
“ER7 – preservation of the humidity in the environment” criterion (Table 5.3).
The AHP analysis results for the biodiversity criteria demonstrated that the high￾est fndings were observed in B1 – preservation of freshwater sources (0.193), B2 – 
providing an ecological solution for rainwater harvesting (0.168), and B4 – attraction 
of insects, birds, and butterfies due to higher planting level (0.159) criteria. The 
lowest weight was observed in the “B8 – absorption of up to 30% more water when 
compared to a lawn (0.053)” criterion (Table 5.3).
The AHP analysis results for the water management/economy criteria, the high￾est weight was observed in “WME1 – contribution to national and global economy” 
(0.394), WME2 – promotion of alternative water resources (0.159), and WME4 – 
reduction in garden maintenance (0.112) criteria (Table 5.3).
5.5.2 Sample Rain Garden Design
The contribution of rain gardens to the ecosystem has been emphasized in numerous 
studies. In the present study, the contribution of rain gardens was categorized based 
on the study’s objective, literature review, and statistical analysis. As a result, a 
sample rain garden model was proposed and presented in Fig. 5.5.
There are several parameters that should be considered before the construction of 
a rain garden. Climatic features, soil properties, topographic features, and plant 
maps are just a few of these parameters (Maksimovic and Tejada-Guibert 2001). 
The model proposed in the present study could serve as an example for these param￾eters. The rain garden layers and the objectives of these layers are presented in the 
fgure. In the methodology phase, the inclusion of the criteria, determined based on 
the literature review and statistical analyses, in the rain garden layers and their func￾tions are presented in Fig. 5.5. To provide an example of these parameters, allowing 
the penetration of rainwater to groundwater by pooling (ER2) and the layers with 
hydrological functions (ER3 and ER5) were schematized. Fragrant, colorful, and 
fruit plants were employed to attract insects, birds, and butterfies, in other words, 
the fauna to the garden (B4). For the seed source function (B7), species with seed 
sustainability were preferred. The lack of irrigation requirements and water-saving

To prevent soil loss (ER6), taxa that hold onto the soil and perennial taxa with high 
pollen were selected (B3 and B5).

The difference between this design and those presented in previous studies in the 
literature was the fact that it was based on parameters based on a statistical approach 
and literature review. As explained in the methodology, the parameters were priori￾tized with the multivariate decision-making method (AHP). Then, the sample design 
was constructed based on the primary parameters (Fig. 5.7).

5.6 Discussion
Rain gardens are alternative green infrastructure systems to gray infrastructures and 
could allow ecological sustainability and provide solutions to the problems caused 
by impermeable urban surfaces. Previous scientifc studies demonstrated that a 
water-sensitive urban design approach should be adopted to facilitate the access of 
rainwater that becomes irregular due to environmental problems to groundwater and 
to prevent foods due to heavy precipitation.
Hoyer et al. (2011) emphasized the signifcance of rainwater management in the 
improvement of the peace and quality of life in cities, consistent with the WME 
criteria selected in the present study. Katsifarakis et al. (2015) focused on the basic 
properties of rain gardens (Katsifarakis et al. 2015), Müftüoglu and Perçin (2015) 
focused on the aesthetic and functional importance of rain gardens, while Avdan 
(2015) discussed environmental, economic, and social aspects. Scientifc studies 
mentioned above focused on various benefts of rain gardens. For example, certain 
M. Onur87
were on aesthetic; others were on psychological, economic, etc. benefts. In the 
present study, based on a comprehensive literature review, the prevalent parameters 
in previous studies were grouped and prioritized based on a statistical method, fll￾ing an important gap in the literature. This could also be considered as a difference 
between the present study and the others.
5.7 Conclusion
Human contribution is signifcant in several ecological pressures that complicate 
and even threaten the lives of all living beings. Even though it is humans who dis￾rupt the natural balance, humans should prevent the consequences, and protect and 
adapt to the new situation to survive. Human demands increase every day, leading 
to several problems. Technological advances, industrialization, consumption of 
natural resources, and population growth promoted several problems and made it 
impossible to survive on earth with sustainable resources. Various studies empha￾size that only natural solutions can prevent the demise of the world and underscore 
the power of nature itself to heal both itself and its inhabitants. (GIS 2013; Reeve 
et al. 2017).
It could be suggested based on the analyses conducted in the present study that 
the development of a sustainable water management system based on the three basic 
dimensions of ecosystem resilience, biodiversity, and water management/economy 
could contribute to the sustainability of life signifcantly (USEPA 2010, 2014a, b; 
URL-1; CSB 2018; RHS 2021; Turkelboom et al. 2021; Sevimli 2021; Tundisi and 
Tundisi 2016). The data collected from the experts were grouped with the analytical 
hierarchical process (AHP) method (Saaty and Vargas 2001). The prominence of the 
parameters based on weight was determined, and the parameters were categorized. 
The three main criteria [ecosystem resilience (ER), biodiversity (B), and water man￾agement/economy (WME)] were investigated based on the 24 sub-criteria. The 
fndings revealed the following:
In the ecosystem resilience group, the highest weight was determined in the 
ER1 – reduction of the urban heat island effect (0.422) criterion. It could be observed 
that the reduction of the urban heat island factor had a signifcant impact on decision￾making in rain garden design. The highest result obtained with this parameter was 
due to climate change and urban heat island effect, which affect the whole world 
and play a key role in the global water cycle. This was followed by the ER2 – allow￾ing the penetration of rainwater to groundwater by pooling (0.115) and ER3 – pres￾ervation of hydrological functions in urban areas (0.089) criteria. The common 
denominator in these two parameters was the functional water recycling. It was 
observed that the weight of these two parameters was higher when compared to the 
others in the rain garden design. It was observed that the highest parameters were 
generally in the “ecosystem resilience” group. This could be due to the effective 
recovery of water in the ecosystem.
5 The Employment of Rain Gardens in Urban Water Management to Improve…88
The highest weight among the biodiversity criteria was observed in the “B1 – 
preservation of freshwater sources” criterion (0.193). It could be suggested that the 
possible reduction in freshwater resources in the near future affected the weight of 
this criterion. It is important to preserve freshwater in the decisive stage in rain gar￾den design. Other important parameters included B2 – providing an ecological solu￾tion for rainwater harvesting (0.168) and B4  – attraction of insects, birds, and 
butterfies due to higher planting levels (0.159). The fact that rain gardens provide 
an ecological solution and could host was an important design parameter.
The fndings in the water management/economy category, the highest weight 
was observed in WME1  – contribution to national and global economy (0.394), 
WME2 – promotion of alternative water resources (0.159), and WME4 – reduction 
in garden maintenance (0.112) criteria. Based on these fndings, it could be sug￾gested that these three parameters were more signifcant when compared to the 
others in the water management/economy category. The fact that these parameters 
had the highest weight in the WME category suggested that this problem was no 
longer a problem associated with a nation or a city, but became a global problem. As 
indicated in several studies, the fndings demonstrated that solutions with global 
benefts are required.
The rain garden design, a sustainable model developed in the last stage of the 
study, provides an example for future studies. In rain garden design, there are sev￾eral parameters of consideration, in addition to those discussed in the current study 
since every design is unique to the study area. However, the design developed in the 
present study provides an alternative approach to the implementation of the primary 
criteria in the garden and the analysis of various criteria in the process. The most 
important approach in the solution was the comparison and prioritization of the 
parameters before the design phase.

A Study of Nature-Based Solutions via 
a Thematic Analysis of the Stakeholders’ 
Perceptions to Address Water Scarcity 
in a Hot and Semiarid Climate: A Case 
Study of Iran
Amir Gholipour, Leyla Beglou, and Seyed M. Heidari
Abstract Water scarcity is an old and long-term problem in the Middle East, espe￾cially in Iran, where water shortage has been a challenge for over a decade. Insecurity 
to access water resources has been amplied due to climate change and unbalanced 
and unsustainable economic development, inuencing the environment and society. 
In this study, we conducted multiple semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, 
including academics investigating water shortage, NGOs, states, water consultant 
companies, farmers, people who face direct and indirect water scarcity, and locals 
dealing with water scarcity in Iran. These semi-structured 16 interviews were tran￾scribed into text and excerpts, and a hybrid thematic analysis comprising inductive 
and deductive approaches was employed for the transcription assessment. The the￾matic analysis of Iranian’s stakeholders was conducted to identify barriers and 
enablers of potential solutions. The frequency of common comments (Fr) was 
counted to realize the importance of each reply. The thematic analysis revealed 45 
drivers of water scarcity, including precipitation reduction (Fr = 14), water trans￾mission (12), illegal underground water utilization (12), dam overconstruction (12), 
drought (12), high water consumption in agriculture (11), and climate change (10). 
The main goal of this study is to map the water scarcity problem in Iran based on 
stakeholders’ viewpoints, which can be helpful for researchers and policymakers to 
understand the situation and dene applicable solutions. This research also discussed

6.1 Introduction
Water resources have become scarcer over the past decade. Availability of freshwa￾ter changes swiftly all around the globe, leading to water security (access to suff￾cient quality of safe water) and a tenuous future (Hoekstra et al. 2018). Studies such 
as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) by NASA, launched in 
2002, showed that dry regions are getting drier and wet regions are getting wetter 
(Kornfeld et al. 2019). Based on GRACE, the world’s higher latitudes, like in the 
northern half of the United States, and the lower latitudes, such as the global tropics, 
are gaining water. In contrast, the mid-latitudes and the semiarid belt in between are 
simultaneously losing water. Global demo-geographical data shows most of the 
earth’s population resides in the mid-semiarid sandwiched belt (Hodgson 2004). 
Thus, water security risks can impact a wide range of Earth residents and, more 
drastically, in the Middle Eastern region like Iran, which is in a hot and semiarid 
climate. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted a similar 
pattern that will extend to the end of the twenty-frst century, mainly due to climate 
change (Smith et al. 2009). Apart from climate change, other factors are stressing 
the scarcity of water resources, among which population growth, increase in water 
demand, poor water management, and uneven combined development of industries 
and agricultural practices are the main drivers, and they trigger potentially a water 
crisis on the next level (Madani 2014).
Water is an element of life, and its scarcity constrains essential priorities, includ￾ing the right to access clean water and sanitation and the conservation of habitat and 
biodiversity. Water-related problems threaten arid and semiarid regions of the earth, 
and Iran is no exception (Saatsaz 2020). Likewise, having suffcient water resources 
makes water-intensive industries and agricultural practices feasible. Water scarcity 
impacts economic development and imposes zero-sum compromises in the alloca￾tion of water between, on the one hand, food and energy and, on the other hand, 
commercial commodities and services (Gheuens et al. 2019). The scarcity also chal￾lenges governmental bodies to wisely distribute fnancial resources among high￾value industries or other productive capacities, limiting long-term development 
(Loucks 2000). Meanwhile, climate change has been exacerbating access to water 
resources and increasing the risk of success in long-term territorial and national 
strategies. Since climate change impacts and the rate of getting drier (GRACE) can￾not be predicted to liaise long-term strategy for the development with climate 
A. Gholipour et al.95
change (Kornfeld et al. 2019), rethinking water resource management according to 
the potential risks of climate transition would alleviate the drawbacks of the long￾term strategies. Water sources would be differently managed to cope with water 
shortage, and alternative solutions can break through the barriers to address insuf￾fcient access to water via a transition from a linear economy to a circular system 
(Sauvé et al. 2021). Linear water resource management consists of water extraction, 
water use, and water disposal, which is an unsustainable approach and is still com￾mon in many parts of the world. On the one hand, resources are taken without 
replacement in the linear strategy, and on the other hand, surface and groundwater 
resources are contaminated through unwanted pollutants. Occurring and emerging 
pollutants are excreting from many sources to the natural bodies, of which pollut￾ants from the urban environment, industrial complexes, agricultural practices, and 
meat and dairy production facilities are the prime sources.
Nonetheless, the linear approach can no longer be an effcient tactic for the 
current water scarcity around the globe. The linear approach, therefore, ought to 
be revised and evolved to a circular paradigm in which, reduce, reuse, and recycle 
(3Rs) are pondered as the key principles (Mohanty 2011). Previous studies have 
proposed various techniques to reduce water consumption at different levels, such 
as in urban congestion, industries, and agricultural sectors (Randolph and Troy 
2008). An illustration of water management and reduction in an urban environ￾ment is rainwater harvesting, although it depends on climate conditions 
(Campisano et al. 2017). Modifying and upgradation of irrigation techniques and 
the types of machinery are also frequent approaches, particularly in the agricul￾tural feld (Chartzoulakis and Bertaki 2015). Several strategies have been sug￾gested to deal with water shortage in industries, of which an optimization in the 
manufacturing processes would also be a prevailing strategy (Klemeš 2012). To 
achieve an effcient 3Rs, nature’s capacity can contribute, which is nowadays well 
known as nature-based solutions (NbS) (Gholipour et al. 2022; Oral et al. 2020; 
Atanasova et al. 2021; Stefanakis et al. 2021). NbS has recently drawn attention 
to smart transit from linear to circular economy, specifcally in the water domain 
(Pearlmutter et al. 2020; Smol et al. 2023). NbS units are a socio-ecological and 
socio-technical approach (Van der Jagt et al. 2020), providing various services for 
water pollution and treatment and further reuse like constructed wetlands (CW), 
which is a popular technology (Gholipour et  al. 2023b;  Kadlec et  al. 2000; 
Stefanakis 2022). Constructed wetlands, either in domestic water and wastewater 
management (Gaballah et al. 2021; Gholipour and Stefanakis 2021; Daee et al. 
2019) or for the industrial disposed of streams of water (Schultze-Nobre et al. 
2017; Stefanakis 2020; Gholipour et al. 2020), has been shown as a cost-effective 
and environmentally friendly technology. NbS can also be integrated into water￾shed management (Ramírez-Agudelo et al. 2020; Kumwimba et al. 2023) at dif￾ferent levels and events, from stormwater collection, treatment, and reuse to 
ecosystem services such as preserving habitat and biodiversity. The role and 
impact of NbS in landscaping cannot be underestimated, empowering nature to 
address water scarcity (Addo-Bankas et al. 2022; Mendonça et al. 2021).
6 A Study of Nature-Based Solutions via a Thematic Analysis of the Stakeholders…96
Acquiring relevant water stakeholders’ perceptions is crucial to moving from 
the current water resources management to a circular system (Kislev 2013; 
Hosseinian and Nezamoleslami 2018). The stakeholders in agriculture and 
industry are the major consumers; on a global scale, they consume more than 70 
percent of water resources (Salehi 2022). In Iran, the agricultural sector also has 
the highest water consumption (Yazdandoost 2016). Several studies have shown 
that although various agro-stakeholders play crucial roles in water scarcity, they 
think differently about the nature, causes, effects, and permanency of agricul￾tural water poverty (Forouzani et al. 2013). Thus, the management and govern￾ing bodies have been struggling to defne water scarcity challenges frstly and 
the trustworthiness between stakeholders and decision-makers has weakened, 
creating consecutive problems. In the industrial domain, many stakeholders are 
not aware of their role and impact on water resources, and their perspectives and 
approach, nevertheless, can contribute to achieving a circular paradigm using 
NbS (Piadeh et al. 2022). Within a circular strategy, sustainable solutions, e.g., 
NbS, can play an important role; however, the challenges, opportunities, and 
problems related to NbS have not been thoroughly studied, particularly for 
semiarid regions like Iran. The challenges of integrating NbS into the current 
water resource management are also not identifed. The perceptions of various 
individuals regarding Iran’s water resource management must be obtained for a 
possible integration of a circular approach via NbS. Before this, the major driv￾ers of water scarcity should be discussed with the individuals, and the solutions 
fgured out to water scarcity require comprehensive analysis. The present study 
aims to acquire the perceptions of water-related stakeholders to identify poten￾tial solutions for the current water scarcity in Iran. Another goal is to analyze 
the possible application of NbS in Iran’s water resource management to achieve 
a circular water economy. The study will also provide enablers and barriers to 
NbS in developing countries like Iran.
6.2 Materials and Methods
6.2.1 A Case Study of Iran
Iran is located at latitude 32.427908 and longitude 53.688046 with 1.648 mil￾lion km2
 and 85 million population in 2021, while Tehran, the capital city, has 
over 9 million population itself. The country is subdivided into 31 provinces, 
each governed by a local center, and the largest local city is called the capital of 
each province. The climate of Iran is mainly arid and semiarid, while the north￾ern coastal areas and western parts are mild and relatively wet, especially on the 
coast of the Caspian Sea. Iran has an extreme continental climate with hot and 
A. Gholipour et al.97
dry summers, and in inland areas, icy winters occur. Therefore, the annual pre￾cipitation varies throughout the country, ranging from 35 (part of the central 
basin) to 1500 mm (some coastal areas near the Caspian Sea), while an average 
of 228 mm falls annually. The average temperature in the eastern region of Iran 
is 39 °C, the precipitation is less than 200 mm, and the most relatively scant 
annual precipitation falls between October and April (fall and winter). Several 
large rivers fow in Iran, such as the Karun River, which is navigable, while the 
others are too steep, and irregular rivers rarely receive runoffs. The Karun River 
extends for 890 km, fowing through the southwest to the Shatt al-Arab, formed 
by the Euphrates and Tigris after a confuence in Iraq. Iran has been suffering 
from enormous food events, mainly during Spring, having destroyed the funda￾mental infrastructure of the country. However, water is naturally stored in 
underground resources and is lifted by several wells and subterranean water 
canals or aqueducts (Qanat).
The impact of the evaporation rate on water scarcity is quite intense in Iran, esti￾mated at 68% of the rainfall volume before reaching the rivers (The Statistical Centre 
of Iran 2020). More than 400 billion cubic meters (BCM) have been reported as an 
average annual rainfall in Iran, of which 120 BCM is estimated as total long-term 
renewable water resources and 78 BCM go to surface runoff (UN 2022). It is also 
reported that 45 BCM per annum is groundwater recharge, of which 26 and 74% are 
attributed to Qanat and wells, respectively. The available per capita water has continu￾ously decreased since 1956 from 7000 m3
 to 1500 m3
 in 2022. The groundwater holds 
only 33.5 BCM annually, supplying two-thirds of the irrigated demands and over 43% 
of the agricultural demand (Zekri 2020). Although the infltration volume is 58 BCM, 
the groundwater abstraction is 63.8 BCM, accounting for 5.6 BCM overexploitation 
of the national groundwater resources. Almost 650 thousand legal and illegal wells 
exist in Iran, accelerating water exploitation from the central basins of Iran, where 
fewer surface water resources are available (Moridi 2017).
In terms of wastewater reuse, Iran has over 90% coverage of sewer network col￾lection in the urban sector, most of which fows to the centralized wastewater treat￾ment plants (WWTPs) (Zekri 2020). However, almost two-thirds of industrial 
wastewater does not meet any treatment and fows to the surface water resources, 
polluting them and limiting access to clean resources. The municipalities have been 
recently reusing treated wastewater for urban demands, while the practice is not 
common and continuous throughout Iran. On the other hand, Iran has been develop￾ing fossil fuel–driven desalination plants since 1960, and 73 desalination sites are 
currently in operation, mainly in the southern strip of Iran, supplying only 
420,000 m3
 freshwater (Ghazaie et al. 2019). Therefore, the portion of desalination 
in the Iranian water supply is low, and the government plans to build 50 more sites 
to provide water for 17 provinces and 45 million people. At the same time, there is 
no information on the plan’s cost, energy supply, environmental impacts, and fund￾ing resources (Zekri 2020).

6.2.2 Semi-structured Interviews and Transcription
This study used a widely employed semi-structured interview method to conduct 
interviews with relevant water stakeholders in Iran. The method allows interviewees 
to comment on a subject they conceive pertinent to the water scarcity study. The 
semi-structured interview is an open-ended method that enables interviewees to ask 
the interviewer to elaborate questions and make examples (Voegeli and Finger 
2021; Gholipour et al. 2023a). Five groups of stakeholders were initially established 
to consider a wide range of stakeholders, including public, private, academics, envi￾ronmental NGOs, and local communities. Then, we used a snowball method to 
identify proceeding interviewees in which the interviewees introduced the next per￾son (Gholipour et al. 2023a). Each stakeholder was numbered with a code, and the 
list of interviewees can be found in Table 6.1.
Interviewers presented a general introduction about the study’scope and objec￾tives at the beginning of each interview and continued based on a questionnaire. 
Various questions and contents relevant to water scarcity were asked during the 
interviews; however, the semi-structured interviews were based on the following 
questions:
1. What are the possible applications of NbS in Iran?
2. What are the NbS benefts?
3. Who are the NbS’ main actors/stakeholders for water management in Iran?
4. Is there any NbS-supportive legislation in Iran that you know of?
5. Do you have any proposals to support NbS in Iran?
6. What are the NbS barriers in Iran?
7. What are the NbS enablers in Iran?
The corresponding questionnaire can be found in the supplementary materials. 
Each interview took between 30 and 60 minutes on average. In total, 16 in-person 
or online interviews were conducted with different water and NbS stakeholders in 
Iran. The interviews proceeded in the local language (Persian) to include as many 
stakeholders as possible. All interviews were recorded for further transcription and 
coding. Afterward, the audio was transcribed and converted to text.

6.2.3 Variables’ Identifcation and Coding
Three steps on each audio were conducted to enhance the precision of interviews. 
First, each audio was played and transcribed through a transcription tool (Live 
Transcribe). Second, the interviews’ texts were divided into thematical sections 
according to the questionnaire content. And third, the audio was replayed and simul￾taneously checked with the automatically transcribed texts (text proofreading), which 
contributed to liaising between the texts and the audio (Gholipour et al. 2023a). To 
respond to the questions of the study, interviewees’ sections were then analyzed, and 
codes with meaningful content were extracted through Vivo coding from excerpts. In 
the Vivo coding, the name of each code is selected based on the words extracted from 
each excerpt; therefore, each code is tagged accordingly to be less prone to bias. To 
create themes out of identifed codes, we used a hybrid method, including deductive 
and inductive, in which the former is based on a predefned set of codes (here is our 
questionnaire), and the latter is the themes were identifed and gathered through Vivo 
coding, and theme creation. Therefore, using the semi-structured list of questions, the 
themes were structured to eliminate cognitive biases, while the transcribed text would 
open new relevant content to the study (Voegeli and Finger 2021). Eventually, the 
seven themes in this study are NbS applications, NbS benefts, NbS and water stake￾holders, NbS laws, NbS accelerators (proposals), NbS barriers, and NbS enablers.
6.3 Results
In this study, the drivers of water scarcity in Iran are initially identifed through 
interviews, and then the application of NbS is discussed. Moreover, the advantages 
and co-benefts of NbS implementation are then defned to encourage individuals to 
think more about eco-based solutions. Another fundamental key to NbS’ successful 
practices is the role of stakeholders connected to the current laws and the alteration 
in regulations and policies. Most importantly, obstructing and facilitating factors are 
listed as NbS barriers and enablers in Iran. The last section represents viable recom￾mendations for Iran’s decision-making system.
6.3.1 Water Scarcity Drivers in Iran
The interviewees were asked to comment on the reasons for water scarcity in Iran. 
In total, 45 drivers were identifed for water scarcity, of which different stakeholders 
pointed out various drivers. Figure 6.1 provides the water scarcity drivers and the 
frequency of each factor (repetition of a single driver among stakeholders).

Fig. 6.1 Water scarcity drivers
Although individuals perceived various drivers for water scarcity, seven reasons 
were considered as the most frequented factors (that have a frequency (Fr) more 
than 10) (Fig. 6.1). Precipitation reduction (Fr = 14), water transmission (Fr = 12), 
illegal underground water utilization (Fr  =  12), dam overconstruction (Fr  =  12), 
drought (Fr = 11), high water consumption in agriculture (Fr = 10), and climate 
change (Fr =10) are among the most critical drivers. The stakeholders considered 
other reasons for water scarcity in Iran (Fr ≥ 5), including low water tariff, under￾valuing water, mismanagement of water resources, uneven urban planning, overuse 
and wastage of water, lack of technological development, current Iranian water￾related regulations, old methods and machinery in agriculture and industries, lack of 
knowledge in water resource management, traditional agriculture, disregard for 
water scarcity, water leakage in water distribution networks, and virtual water export.
6.3.2 NbS Applications in Iran
According to interviewees’ perceptions, nature-based solutions can have various 
applications in Iran. The results showed that 44 applications of NbS can be per￾ceived, which can be classifed into water, energy, food, air, greenery, groundwater, 
and other aspects (seven classifcations). The frequency and applications of NbS are 
represented in Table 6.2.

Although a wide range of applications was introduced for the Iran case study, 
the water and food sectors appeared to be the most important domain. The high￾est frequency in food classifcation is improving cropping patterns by Fr = 14, 
and the result indicates that food production is another required feld for NbS by 
Fr = 13. In the water classifcation, watershed management (Fr = 9) and waste￾water treatment and reuse (Fr  =  8) are perceived as potential sectors for the 
applications of NbS. In the air classifcation, dust management (Fr = 8) has the 
highest frequency, while green infrastructure (Fr  =  7) is fundamental in the 
greenery classifcation. NbS can also reduce solid waste (Fr = 8) and preserve 
biodiversity (Fr = 6).
6.3.3 NbS Benefts
Stakeholders perceived various NbS benefts (Table 6.3), and 24 elements were 
identifed in which low energy consumption has the highest frequency (Fr = 13). 
Alleviation of climate change (Fr  =  12) and contribution to food provision 
(Fr = 11) are the other advantages of NbS. In terms of water benefts, improve￾ment in water resources management (Fr = 5) was considered a potential direct 
beneft of NbS, which can be considered for the current water crisis in Iran.

6.3.4 NbS Stakeholders
According to Fig. 6.2, the interviewees believe that 17 stakeholders in Iran are rel￾evant to NbS. The Ministry of Agriculture, government, and local water and waste￾water organizations are the stakeholders with higher frequency in the interviews 
(Fr = 15). In total, six ministries were perceived as pertinent to NbS, among which 
ministries of science (Fr = 14), agriculture (Fr = 15), and energy (Fr = 12) were 
frequently repeated in the interviews.
Environmental protection organizations, farmers, property holders, private sec￾tor, and academics were also considered other relevant and frequented stakeholders.
6.3.5 NbS Supportive Laws
Although interviewees were asked to mention the supportive laws for NbS in Iran, 
most interviewees only perceived a few activities implying indirect contributions to 
NbS promotion. An illustration of that was the regulation for innovative companies 
and start-ups in which the stakeholders contemplated companies-based research and 
development foundation (Fr = 3) could infuence NbS applications in Iran. Regarding 
the water sector, the law for equal water distribution (Fr = 1) was another factor giving 
rise to NbS. In addition, it is stated that there has been recently a regulation for green￾ery in the housing and construction market, which supports the implementation of 
biophilic designs and particularly the use of green roofs. Green and vertical gardens

6.3.6 NbS Barriers and Enablers
To implement NbS in Iran, interviewees were asked to comment on the possible 
barriers and enablers of NbS to mitigate water shortage. Figures 6.4 and 6.5 repre￾sent the barriers and enablers of NbS. In total, we have identied 16 obstacles to 
NbS in Iran.
Figure 6.4 shows that the lack of interest (Fr = 12) and NbS knowledge (Fr = 10) 
are the most effective barriers to promoting NbS in Iran. In addition, other factors, 
including the lack of NbS examples (Fr = 9) and the current laws and regulations 
(Fr = 8), are among the most noticeable obstructing issues. There are also 12 more 
barriers to NbS with less importance, e.g., international economic sanctions, peo￾ple’s mindset, acquaintance with traditional farming, lack of investment, NbS trust￾worthiness, and religious norms.
Despite many barriers, 14 NbS enablers were determined in this study. 
Interviewees believe that materials are accessible in Iran’s market to construct NbS 
(Fr = 13), while the semiarid climate of Iran is perceived as another important cata￾lyst for NbS promotion (Fr = 11).
In Iran, other factors, including low energy cost (Fr = 9) and low workforce cost 
(Fr = 8), were found as NbS enablers. During our discussions with stakeholders, we 
realized that academic society welcomes innovations more particularly. The natural 
capacity, biodiversity, and availability of space were mentioned as other NbS 
enablers in Iran.

6.4 Discussion and Recommendations to Manage Iran’s 
Water Scarcity
Iran’s current water shortage status can be dened as a water bankruptcy (Olen 
2021). But employing NbS may provide a new paradigm for dealing with water 
shortage. The Iranian government should initially consider the water scarcity driv￾ers and analyze them to act permissible actions. Although the interviewees in this 
study mentioned many drivers, some of the drivers require international agreements 
and collaboration, while many drivers can be regarded under national authorities. 
Among the water scarcity drivers, reduction in precipitation and climate change is 
the issue relevant to environmental justice and world industrialization (Van Horne 
A. Gholipour et al.107
et al. 2023) that are out of control. The current practices like underground water 
utilization, dam overconstruction, and high-water consumption in agriculture can be 
nationally addressed by rethinking water resources management and authorizing 
water governance and distribution.
Although NbS is relatively unknown in Iranian system thinking, 24 elements of 
NbS benefts were found in our study. In the current world of energy and food short￾ages, NbS could play an essential role in reducing energy consumption and increas￾ing crop yields contributing to food provision. One of the most challenging issues 
involving climate change’s impact on the production system is encompassing sus￾tainable techniques (Wynberg et al. 2023). Another advantage of using NbS is in the 
energy sector, of which energy saving as a fundamental beneft has been evident in 
previous studies (Atanasova et  al. 2021). The role of NbS in the circularity and 
water-energy-food nexus (WEF) cannot be underestimated in which NbS would 
mitigate urban circularity challenges (UCCs) and can contribute to WEF (Carvalho 
et al. 2022). In Iran, NbS would reduce water consumption in an urban environment, 
reduce energy utilization and urban heat islands (UHIs), and provide, for instance, 
nutrient sources (Oral et al. 2020).
To make effective decisions, act, and authorize actions and plans, Iranian stake￾holders, like ministries, parliament, government, and water and wastewater organi￾zations, are at the forefront of combating water shortage. NbS would gain fame in 
society if bureaucracy is shortened, which can be regulated by main stakeholders. In 
addition, subsidies and incentives should be considered as the basis (Gholipour 
et al. 2023a). NbS should also be promoted in the educational system, and examples 
of NbS can be integrated into harmonized content to refer to it. In contrast, in the 
current Iranian system, NbS projects are scattered and are not seen as a united para￾digm. Authorities in Iran should also observe the NbS barriers, like the lack of inter￾est and NbS knowledge. These may be addressed by providing motives to the 
practitioners and international collaboration to import NbS knowledge into the aca￾demia frst and then to the industries. Meanwhile, Iran’s climate condition and natu￾ral capacity in the environment and resources would allow the stakeholders to take 
NbS as a viable option when it comes to water resource management.
6.5 Conclusion
Water scarcity is a long-term problem in the Middle East and North Africa, and it 
has emerged in the Mediterranean region in recent years. Not only does it impact 
food provision and industries, but also energy supply in hydro-power plants has 
faced troubles due to less precipitation and increment in water consumption in cit￾ies. Moreover, national, and international conficts over water resources have 
occurred throughout the past decades. Nature-based solutions (NbS) can be an 
impactful solution to water scarcity. However, the opportunities and obstacles are 
poorly studied for developing countries like Iran. This study employed semi￾structured interviews to collect stakeholders’ viewpoints on water scarcity and

NbS. We obtained the perspectives of different stakeholders to identify the drivers 
of water scarcity in general and to propose sustainable water management solutions. 
Stakeholders perceived that NbS is appropriate for tackling climate change and 
improving social quality indicators, particularly in mitigating water shortage. 
Through conducting 16 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, we found 45 
drivers for the water crisis in Iran. Some drivers are under the control of the gover￾nance, like the water transmission line, and others, like the reduction in precipita￾tion, are out of control. We found 44 applications of NbS in water, energy, food, air, 
greenery, groundwater, and other sectors, which would contribute to water shortage 
mitigation. The benefts of NbS were also identifed as low energy consumption, 
climate change mitigation, and food provision, among the most crucial elements. 
Stakeholders also mentioned supportive actions that can promote NbS in Iran, like 
promoting NbS knowledge in the educational system, tax waiving, and incentiviza￾tion. Lack of NbS knowledge and interests in the society were identifed as barriers 
to NBS, whereas 14 NbS enablers in Iran were mentioned, including Iran’s climate 
condition, low energy consumption for NbS projects, and low cost in the workforce 
compared to other conventional and gray techniques. In this study, we tried to map 
the water scarcity issue and potential NbS based on stakeholders’ perspectives 
which can be helpful for policymakers to see the bigger picture, potential capacity 
to employ NbS, and pick practical solutions. Although we focused only on Iran’s 
water management system in this study, this semi-structured interview approach 
and thematic analysis can be extended to other developing countries in semiarid 
areas. In addition, how NbS can address water-related challenges in Iran and to what 
extent eco-based solutions alleviate the impacts of water shortage are uncertain.

A Pilot Study from the Niger Republic
Moussa Soulé, Ebru Nergiz, and Hamidou Taffa Abdoul-Azize
Abstract For a long decade, the Niger Republic has witnessed the presence of 
many nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Recently, the number of NGOs has 
increased in the country, especially those targeting rural communities. These NGOs 
implement several activities and programs in various areas to support rural popula￾tions. Accordingly, they might play a key role in supporting the country to achieve 
signicant sustainable development goals within the United Nations Agenda. This 
study uses secondary data such as NGO activities in reports and websites, gray lit￾erature from opened ofcial reports, and scholarly published articles to investigate 
women-based NGO activities, programs, and interconnected SDGs in the Niger 
Republic. The ndings of the study showed that most NGO activities and programs 
have several socioeconomic and ecological implications on women and young girls 
and are interconnected to many sustainable development goals of the United 
Nations. For instance, most NGO interventions aim at alleviating poverty (SDG1), 
ending hunger (SDG2), and improving women’s good health and well-being 
(SDG3), as well as other SDGs such as SDG4, SDG7, SDG8, SDG10, SDG13, and 
SDG16). As the population of Niger Republic experiences, numerous challenges 
such as climate-induced shocks, conicts, poverty, and illiteracy; country 
policymakers and designers; and NGO partners and fund providers should design a

comprehensive regulation of NGO activities, and programs by, for instance, priori￾tizing the NGO interventions based on the level of the exposure of the population to 
the abovementioned challenges. This would not only empower women and young 
girls residing in rural communities but also contribute to the overall society’s resil￾ience and well-being as well as support the efforts of the country to achieve signif￾cant SDGs by 2030.

7.1 Introduction
Numerous NGOs intervene in Africa where they carry out a variety of activities and 
programs to support the poor and vulnerable groups. This target is to enhance the 
resilience of these groups to several challenges and shocks, especially in rural areas 
(Tahiru 2019; Foo 2018). Some NGOs raise the awareness of the populations about 
climate change (Brass 2012; Bawakyillenuo et al. 2015), while others train rural 
farmers and breeders on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies (Jones 
et al. 2016; Oppenheimer 1990) and enhance research and partnerships with politics 
in a specifc area such as climate fnance for better response to climate change 
(Newell et al. 2015; Yaro et al. 2015; Béné et al. 2016). Accordingly, NGOs conduct 
numerous activities and programs that have multiple socioeconomic and environ￾mental dimensions such as raising population awareness, mapping people’s vulner￾ability and risk, and building community capacity and resilience toward shocks 
(Darzi-Naftchali and Shahnazari 2014; De Pascale et  al. 2016). In this context, 
(Bulkeley and Newell 2010; Dalton et al. 2014) mention that NGOs play a key role 
in advocating environmental concerns, whereas (Foo 2018; Jones et  al. 2016; 
Bulkeley and Newell 2010; Dalton et al. 2014) highlight that NGOs contribute to 
alleviating poverty and social inequity through sustainable development commit￾ment. Further, (Lazzarotto et al. 2010; Verpoorten et al. 2013) indicate that the inter￾ventions of NGOs are conducted both at local and global levels while (Newell et al. 
2015; Amundsen et  al. 2018) underscore that most NGO interventions are 
community-based capacity building.
In fact, the Niger Republic is one of the West African Sahel countries that wit￾ness increasing implementation of NGOs as the country is ranked the poorest one 
on the globe. According to the National Institute of Statistics of Niger Republic, the 
fertility of the country is about 7.6 children by a woman and 50.30% of the coun￾try’s population lives in extreme poverty (Institut National de la Statistique (INS) 
2020). Also, women’s employment rate accounts for 29.03%, while only 22.8% of 
women are employees in the public sector and 18.7% of them work in the private 
sector (Institut National de la Statistique (INS) 2008), and the country’s women’s 
M. Soulé et al.115
literacy is about 15%. Moreover, it is estimated that more than 38% of women expe￾rienced gender-based violence in 2021.
Women are key actors in signifcant economic sectors such as agriculture. About 
48.70% of women in the Niger Republic are engaged in agricultural activities 
(Ministère de l’Agriculture et de l’Elevage du Niger 2021), which may contribute 
signifcantly to the country’s socioeconomic development. Hence, (Tidjani Alou 
et al. 2015) declared that women represent a signifcant part of agricultural labor in 
the Niger Republic and have a key role in the development of the country’s food 
production system. However, women face numerous challenges such as adverse 
impacts of climate, ongoing conficts, and low education. These challenges might 
negatively affect the female farmers’ agriculture activities and livelihood and there￾fore worsen women’s living conditions, especially those living in rural communi￾ties. In this view, (GIZ 2021; CDN 2021) indicate that recurrent climate-induced 
shocks such as droughts, foods, strong winds, extreme heat, and climate-related 
diseases are some of the indicators of the vulnerability of the Niger Republic.
On the other hand, the current insecurity and insecurity-led displacements of the 
population in some regions of the country would negatively affect the socioeco￾nomic and ecological conditions of the country and therefore pose serious threats to 
some specifc vulnerable groups such as women and young girls in rural communi￾ties. Nevertheless, the existence of many NGOs in the country could signifcantly 
support the efforts of the government to overcome numerous challenges such as 
extreme poverty, high illiteracy rate, social conficts, and climate-induced shocks. 
For instance, NGO DIKO intervenes in approximately 67 communes where they 
implement various activities such as women training in tree nurseries and women 
farmers’ training on livelihood activities, promoting income-generating activities 
(cash transfer, and in-kind assistance) and training on degraded land management 
techniques as shown in the following photos (Photos 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4).
Although NGOs might play a signifcant role in supporting the efforts of the 
government in the Niger Republic, most studies conducted in the Niger Republic on 
NGOs investigate the roles of NGOs in sustaining rural livelihoods (Tahiru 2019; 
Premchander 2003; Zaidi et al. 2009; Jenderedjian and Bellows 2021; Forkuor and 
Korah 2022; Mininni 2022) and NGOs’ contribution to gender poverty alleviation 
(Premchander 2003). Other scholars have studied the universal education agenda by 
exploring the partnership between World Bank, NGOs, and civil society, NGOs’ 
contribution to women’s health (Zaidi et al. 2009), NGOs’ healthcare practices and 
gender use of modern contraceptives (Brooks et al. 2019), and NGOs and gender￾based violence in West Africa selected countries (Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and 
Niger) (Ndiaye 2021).
From the above literature, it is obvious that there is a scarcity of studies that 
investigate the connections between NGO activities and programs with the sustain￾able development goals (SDGs) with a focus on women in rural communities.
However, conducting such a kind of study could point out the signifcant contri￾bution of NGOs in supporting the public authorities and reshaping the NGO regula￾tion schemes to achieve the SDGs of the United Nations by the 2030 Agenda. 
Hence, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the NGO activities and

of the study could help the country policy designers and makers not only apprehend 
the contributions of NGOs to the country’s development but also might serve as 
guidelines for them to design a comprehension regulation and defne the role of 
NGOs in the Niger Republic’s development policy and strategies. More especially, 
the study seeks to answer the following questions:
1. What are the NGO activities and programs targeting women and young girls in 
the rural communities of the Niger Republic?
2. What are the socioeconomic and ecological implications of these NGO activities 
and programs for the benefciaries?
3. Which SDGs are interconnected to these women and young girls–based NGO 
activities and programs?
7.2 Methodology
This study used secondary data such as scholarly published articles, NGO websites, 
and gray literature from opened NGO offcial reports. Fourteen NGO programs and 
activities focused on women, and young girls in rural communities of the Niger 
Republic were considered. The inclusion and exclusion criteria of these NGOs are

7.4 Discussion
From Table 7.2, it can be noticed that most NGOs implemented a variety of activi￾ties and interventions in the rural communities of the Niger Republic. Most of these 
activities and interventions target alleviating women poverty and exposure of rural 
households to hunger, famine, and food insecurity, through in-kind assistance (food 
distribution and promotion of cattle fattening) and training women on entrepreneur￾ship and apprenticeship practices and opportunities, savings, credit, and basic fnan￾cial. Providing rural women with income-generating assets (Table 7.2) could help 
them overcome both temporary and chronic poverty as well as increase their power 
in household decision-making. For instance, (Cornwall 2016) highlights that dis￾tributing small animals to women and training them on entrepreneurship by NGOs 
enhances their economic empowerment. Similarly, (Taukobong et al. 2016) states 
that empowering women through income-generating activities improves household 
well-being and reduces family stress and violence, while (Ayodeji et al. 2021) notes 
that empowering women in agricultural practices contributes positively to house￾hold food security.
7 Achieving Sustainable Development Goals Through NGO-Led Women and Young…126
The fndings of the study showed that many NGOs train women on sexual and 
reproductive practices and provide maternity care for women and healthcare for 
children, which contribute to improving women and young girls’ health and well￾being in rural communities. Such activities and interventions contribute, for 
instance, to reducing neonatal mortality rates, improving women’s and children’s 
health and women’s sexual and reproductive health, and therefore enhancing women 
and children’s well-being. In addition, they reduce the spreading of and contamina￾tion of HIV/AIDS and reduce women-based stigma built on such kinds of illnesses. 
This would therefore improve social integration and well-being of women and 
young girls living with HIV/AIDS. Similarly, (Francke and Quispe 2022) mentions 
that reproductive and sexual health services improve women’s well-being, whereas 
(Francke and Quispe 2022; Alimoradi et  al. 2017) highlight that women’s well￾being is one of the important indicators of socioeconomic and ecological sustain￾ability. Further, (Keith et  al. 2022) reports that psychological development 
interventions have the potential to promote women’s psychosocial well-being and/
or prevent or treat women’s mental disorders, and (Keith et al. 2022) stresses that 
this reduces women-based violence.
On the other hand, Table 7.2 shows that most NGOs train women on off-season 
agricultural practices and irrigation systems in rural communities of the Niger 
Republic. This would enhance women’s resilience to food insecurity and temporary 
climate-induced shocks impacts of bad harvest, temporary drought, and therefore 
reduce household exposure to hunger and malnutrition. These fndings align with 
those of (Holland and Rammohan 2019) who reported that the caretaker’s role of 
women as food producers reduces household malnutrition status and those of 
(Rahman and Islam 2014) who highlight that women contribute signifcantly to 
enhancing society’s food and nutritional status.
On the other hand, Table 7.2 shows that many NGOs contribute to building wom￾en’s capacity and skills in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies by 
training them on a variety of techniques such as land and management techniques, 
family farming techniques, small-scale irrigation techniques, sustainable land and 
environmental management, as well as environmental education. Such NGO activi￾ties, programs, and interventions could enhance women’s resilience to the adverse 
impacts of climate change. Likewise, (Ajani et al. 2013) declare that empowering 
women in climate actions is an important means to generate various socioeconomic 
and ecological benefts that lead to enhancing societal resilience. For instance, (Aziz 
et  al. 2022) emphasizes that most NGO climate actions boost the resilience of 
women to food insecurity and aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
(Sinthumule 2022) indicates that such actions contribute to biodiversity 
conservation.
Moreover, Table 7.2 shows that other NGO activities, programs, and interven￾tions include advocating and improving women’s rights, reducing women-based 
violence, improving women’s security and peacebuilding capacity, and therefore 
women promoting community dialogue. Such changes in behavioral activities, pro￾grams, and interventions could play a key role in societal transformation. These 
fndings are similar to those of (Keith et al. 2022) who indicate that reduction of 
M. Soulé et al.127
women-based violence, improving women’s rights and security, and peace-building 
capacity are social and economic empowerment interventions susceptible to trans￾forming positively women’s attitudes toward violence alleviation. In addition, 
(Alvarez 2013) notes that training women in politics on some specifc topics, wom￾en’s rights, peace, and community dialogue, is a key factor of sustainable 
development.
7.5 Conclusions
The study investigates NGO women–based activities, programs, and interventions 
in the rural communities of the Niger Republic and interconnected sustainable 
development goals of the United Nations. The fndings of the study revealed that 
most NGOs’ women-focused activities, programs, and interventions are linked to 
many SDGs of the United Nations. For example, most NGOs promote income￾generating assets/activities for women, which are directly interconnected to ending 
poverty and hunger (SDG1 & SDG2). Some NGOs support young girls’ education 
through scholarships, which contribute to reducing women’s illiteracy and enhanc￾ing education quality (SDG5). Accordingly, NGOs are key actors in supporting the 
Niger Republic public authorities to achieve signifcant SDGs of the United Nations. 
Therefore, NGO actors and the Niger Republic policy designers and makers should 
implement comprehensive regulations of NGO activities that could guide the prior 
intervention areas/ regions for not only empowering women and young girls but 
enhancing their overall social well-being. This could support the country’s efforts to 
achieve signifcant sustainable development goals of the United Nations by 2030. 
Further research could explore, for instance, NGOs’ social protection programs and 
sustainable development goals with a focus on the country’s population.

Phytomining as a Nature-based Solution 
in the Cities of Albania
Aida Bani, Dolja Pavlova, and Seit Shallari
Abstract Phytomining is a “green” alternative to opencast mining practices applied 
to recover a range of metals (Ni, Co, Au). Nickel-rich soils such as ultramac soils 
and industrially polluted soils have a high potential for metal recovery and applica￾tion in metallurgical processes. Plants are cultivated to extract metals from soils and 
transport them to aerial plant parts with subsequent harvesting. Metals are then 
recovered from the biomass. Albania is rich in ultramac soils (11% of the territory) 
and Ni-hyperaccumulators. Phytomining eld plots have been operating since 
2005 in Përrenjas (serpentine and industrial dumpsite) and Elbasan (site, contami￾nated by industrial activities). Consequently, cropping systems have been designed. 
The Ni-hyperaccumulator species Odontarrhena chalcidica cultivated on ultra￾mac plots under organic and mineral fertilization reached a biomass production of 
9.96 t/ha and Ni yields of 145 kg/ha and has the potential to become a cash crop. 
Also, phytomining was applied to municipal and industrial Ni-rich waste and dump￾sites located in Elbasan and Përrenjas. Both places have the highest risk of pollution 
and toxins. We propose phytomining as NbS to improve mineralized soil and restore 
contaminated or degraded soils while producing biomass for industrial use and phy￾tomining in the city environment.

8.1 Introduction
Cities worldwide are centers of human and economic activity and effectively func￾tion as a hub of natural resources. Urban centers consume more than 75% of natural 
resources and they are responsible for 50% of solid waste and emit up to 60% of 
overall greenhouse gas emissions thus contributing to pollution, climate change, 
and biodiversity loss (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017). Cities are facing several 
challenges including resource depletion, climate change, and degradation of eco￾systems (Langergraber et al. 2020, 2021). Nowadays, following the concept of cir￾cular economy, there is an urgent need of more effcient resource management and 
waste prevention in urban areas in order to cope with these challenges. Because the 
current linear economic model is not sustainable and recovers very little of the origi￾nal input a viable solution must be done. In this context, resource recovery using 
nature-based solutions (NbS) is gaining popularity worldwide. According to the 
European Commission (European Commission 2022), NbS are inspired and sup￾ported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, 
social, and economic benefts, and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more 
and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes, 
and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-effcient, and systemic interven￾tions. NbS beneft biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem 
services.
Nature-based solutions or green infrastructure solutions are considered one ele￾ment that can help to achieve this transition and can provide an array of valuable 
services, such as clean water production, nutrient recovery, heavy metals retention 
and recovery, as well as production of a broad range of plant-based materials 
adapted to local conditions (Langergraber et al. 2020; Stefanakis et al. 2021). Based 
on the existing framework (Atanasova et al. 2021), a set of more than 50 NbS units 
and interventions assessed in terms of their potential to address Urban Circularity 
Challenges are suggested and classifed along with several supporting units required 
to create circular economy through NbS (European Commission 2022; Oral et al. 
2021). Various NbS systems at different levels (micro-, meso-, and macro-scale 
based on Kisser et  al. (2020) are implemented in the cities for the recovery of 
resources such as N, P, energy, organics, and water. Van Hullebusch et al. (2021) 
defne input and output resource streams to and from NbS units/interventions that 
support creating circular economy through NbS.
One of the urban circularity challenges addressed by NbS implemented under a 
circular framework is “Material recovery and reuse”, where phytoremediation tech￾nology is included. This specifc technology brings nature into cities using organ￾isms (hyperaccumulator plants) as principal agents, provided they enable resource 
recovery and the restoration of ecosystem services in urban areas. Phytoremediation 
is applied to restore contaminated or degraded soils while producing biomass for 
industrial use such as energy, fber, and phytomining. The technique phytomining or 
agromining (growing hyperaccumulating plants to “mine” high-value metals such 
as Ni, Co, rare earth elements from soil) is applied for contaminated or ultramafc 
A. Bani et al.133
soils. It can also be applied to municipal and industrial solid waste streams (Kisser 
et al. 2015) if the metals are bio-available or made bio-available through appropriate 
additives (Rosenkranz et al. 2017). This technique comprises a chain of processes 
covering the improvement of soil quality (phytoremediation) and the incineration of 
the biomass produced in order to obtain the metals from the ashes of the hyperac￾cumulator plants, which can be considered as a bio-ore and recovered for further use 
(van der Ent et al. 2015). Because of their unusual ability to bioconcentrate and 
purify Ni from soils Ni-hyperaccumulator plants are considered ideal candidates for 
Ni phytomining/agromining. As described by van Hullebusch et al. (2021) inputs 
for phytomining/agromining include the growing substrate, plants, soil amendment 
for biostimulation purposes, and additional microbial strains for bioaugmentation, 
while outputs include improved soil, recovered metal bio-ores (metals-enriched bio￾mass of hyperaccumulator plants) and energy from biomass combustion. In addition 
to metal extraction, agromining agrosystems can also be managed to provide mul￾tiple ecosystem services, such as C sequestration, enhanced soil biodiversity, renew￾able biomass production, improved agricultural crop productivity (safe edible and 
non-edible crops), and land restoration (Kidd et al. 2018). It was found that phytore￾mediation and green amendment-based solidifcation/stabilization are typically “the 
greenest” remediation strategies, but wise decisions should be made on the basis of 
case-specifc sustainability assessment results (Wang et al. 2021).
Phytomining is a “green” alternative to opencast mining practices applied to 
recover a range of metals (Ni, Co, Cd, Fe) but most often is used for Ni production. 
The technological chain has two stages: (1) the cultivation of hyperaccumulator 
plants to obtain suffcient aerial biomass with a high Ni concentration, and (2) the 
transformation of the biomass to obtain valuable end-products, both of importance 
for phytoextraction yield and fnancial feasibility. Recently, key studies for phy￾tomining application on ultramafc agricultural land, ultramafc quarries, and metal￾rich soils or substrates (technosols) based on industrial waste at sites in Greece, 
Albania, Spain, and Austria were provided. They demonstrated the full phytomining 
cycle including the recovery of Ni-rich products and bioenergy (Kidd et al. 2018; 
Bani et al. 2021).
Albania has potential for phytomining/agromining activities because of the fol￾lowing: (1) a large ultramafc area (11% of the territory of the country) including 
agricultural areas (Lekaj et al. 2019); (2) a high density of abandoned or active min￾ing sites as well as metal smelters, and (3) the highest diversity from 
Ni-hyperaccumulator plants in Europe (Cecchi et al. 2018). Since 2005 phytomin￾ing feld plots operate in Pojske, Pogradec (ultramafc), Përrenjas (serpentine quar￾ries), and Elbasan (contaminated by industrial activities) while the application of 
this technology in Albanian city sites started 5 years ago.
This chapter focuses on: (1) the results of applied phytomining technology to 
recover nickel (Ni) from both ex-mining polluted sites and ultramafc sites in some 
cities of Albania; (2) phytomining as NbS that can be applied to any brownfelds in 
cities in other to revitalize the valuable soil resource and enable urban agriculture 
and urban greening.
8 Phytomining as a Nature-based Solution in the Cities of Albania134
8.2 Materials and Methods
8.2.1 Study Area
Phytomining feld plots have been operating since 2005 in Albanian cities Përrenjas 
(serpentine soil of feld of Domosdova and Rajce and industrial dumpsite) and 
Elbasan (contaminated by industrial activities). One of the studied sites is located in 
the industrial area of the town of Elbasan (41°4′58, 54″ N, 20°1′24, 51″ E) (Fig. 8.1). 
Elbasan is one of the largest cities in Albania, which had the biggest metallurgical 
complex of the country (155 hectares) from 1970 to 1990. It is located 4 km far from 
the center of Elbasan city and 0.5 km from the Shkumbin River. At the same time, 
it is the main source of soil and groundwater contamination with heavy metals 
(Osmani et al. 2015, 2018).
The second industrial dumpsite is a former Fe-Ni mining site located 500 m far 
from the city center, an ultramafc outcrop in the east of Përrenjas (41°03′58.97″ N, 
Fig. 8.1 A map of Albania showing the location of the industrial and ultramafc areas: 1. Elbasan 
(contaminated by industrial activities, dumpsite). 2. Përrenjas (industrial and serpentine sites)
A. Bani et al.135
20°32′21.34″ E) at an elevation of 650 m. Përrenjas mine extracted 500 thousand 
tons/year Fe-Ni mineral, where 350 thousand tons was processed in the metallurgi￾cal complex of Elbasan and 150 thousand tons was exported to Europe.
The soil selected for the pot experiment was taken from the 0–30 cm layer of a 
Përrenjas dumpsite (PD) and Elbasan dumpsite (ED). The experiment was carried 
out using 2-L plastic pots with 2 kg soil. For each dumpsite, Përrenjas dumpsite 
(PD) and Elbasan dumpsite (ED), the soil samples were treated with Përrenjas veg￾etation soil (PS) and Elbasan vegetation soil (ES) and with manure (M), in different 
percentages: 100% PD/ED, planted with (A/T); 80% PD/ED + 20% PS/ES planted 
with (A/T); 50% PD/ED + 50% PS/ES planted with (A/T); 80% PD/ED + 20% M 
planted with (A); 50% PD/ED + 50% M planted with (A). The experiment was 
conducted in greenhouse (Osmani and Bani 2017). Prior to starting the incubation, 
the soil was wetted and pre-incubated at greenhouse temperature for 14 days. After 
this period, each individual pot was planted with four seeds of Odontarrhena mura￾lis and Trifolium repens for 5 months. The pots were watered every day. The con￾centration of Ni in plants and plant biomass per pot were measured to calculate the 
potential of nickel phytoextraction in soils of dumpsites after treatment.
Two more study sites near the city of Përrenjas were studied where the soil was 
naturally rich in metals (ultramafc soil) and Ni-hyperaccumulator species 
Odontarrhena chalcidica is naturally distributed. First one was Domosdova feld 
(41°04′08″N, 20°33′11″E), which contains soil developed from a colluvium of 
ultramafc and magnesite origin (Cambic Hypermagnesic Hypereutric Vertisol) and 
second was Fushe Rrajce (41°05 40′N, 20°34 32″E, 560 m a.s.l.) with serpentine 
soil where three composite soil samples per site at 0–20 cm depth were collected.
8.2.2 Determination of Nickel Concentration
Samples were mineralized with a microwave digester (Ethos One Pro-24), where 
0.25–0.3 g of soil or plants sample was digested by adding 8 ml HNO3 69% and 
2 ml H2O2. Solutions were fltered and were adjusted to 50 ml with distilled water. 
Heavy metals were determined spectrochemically using an Atomic absorption spec￾trophotometer (Nov AA-350).
The availability of Ni in dumpsite soils and all treatments were measured using 
a DTPA–TEA extractant (0.005 M DTPA with 0.01 M CaCl2 and 0.1 M triethanol￾amine (TEA) at pH 7.3). A ratio of 1 g soil:10 ml DTPA-TEA solution was shaken 
for 2  h, and then the suspension was centrifuged at 5000g for 20  min, fltered 
through a 0.2 μm pore size cellulose nitrate flter (SARTORIUS) (Xhaferri et al. 
2018). All extractions were performed in triplicate. Ni concentrations in the soil 
extracts were determined electrochemically using an Atomic absorption spectro￾photometer (Nov AA-350).

8.3 Results and Discussion
8.3.1 Soils in Albanian City Sites and Their Role 
in Phytomining
Waste mixed with soil that came from both dumpsites from Përrenjas and Elbasan 
had ultramafc origin. Analysis of the heavy metals concentrations in the dumpsites 
soils showed that Ni (6859 mg kg−1
), Co (286 mg kg−1
), and Fe (36,715 mg kg−1
) 
are higher in Përrenjas dumpsite, because the wastes are raw, while in Elbasan 
dumpsite the concentrations of Cr (7185 mg kg−1
) and Zn (135 mg kg−1
) are higher 
(Osmani et al. 2018; Osmani and Bani 2017). Ni concentration is lower in Elbasan 
dumpsite, because it is processed by the steel plant. The value of Ni and other met￾als in vegetation soils, which are used for mixing, is higher in the Përrenjas soils 
than in those of Elbasan, because the vegetation soil of Përrenjas is serpentine soil 
and the vegetation soil of Elbasan is agricultural soil. The Ni concentration in 
manure (added to improve the soil quality) is under the limit (<210 mg kg−1
), so it 
is not contaminated with metal.
The soil samples collected in the ultramafc sites of Fushe Rrajce and Domosdova 
feld in the area of Përrenjas are characterized by high total concentrations of metals 
(such as Ni, Cr, Co) that are typical of ultramafc environments (Table 8.1). The 
total Ni concentrations were 3498 and 3765 mg kg−1
 respectively in the Domosdova 
feld and Rajce in the rhizospheric soil of O. chalcidica plants. In both sites, soils 
had high Fe concentrations as expected for soils of ultramafc origin (Bani 
et al. 2009).
The available Ni (Ni DTPA) was low (4.7–4.5 mg kg−1
 DW) in mining site and 
from 17 to 56 mg kg−1
 in ultramafc soil. The available nickel results are in lower 
values in industrial areas than in ultramafc because Ni is inside minerals, where it 
is mostly in non-available fractions. This is in accordance with previous studies in 
these sites (Bani et al. 2009, 2015b). Nickel chemical availability in Fushe Rajce 
soils was higher depending on pH, mineralogical, and pedogenetic properties 
(Massoura et al. 2006).
8.3.2 Plants and Their Role in Phytoremediation 
and Phytomining
Plant Characteristics The plants with the potential to accumulate or even hyper￾accumulate extremely high concentrations of toxic metals in different plant organs 
and tissues extracting them from metal-reach soils are at the basis of resource recov￾ery technology such as phytomining/agromining. The concentration level of the 
metals can be hundreds or thousands of times greater than that usually found in 
plants (Reeves et al. 2018). Many hyperaccumulator species invariably have high Ni 
concentrations while others occasionally demonstrate lower Ni (100–1000 μg g−1
)

which indicates lower Ni availability in the soil. Some plants can hyperaccumulate 
more than one metal (Cd, Ni, Pb, Zn), depending on the nature of the soils on which 
they grow. Currently, over 1000 plant species with the ability to hyperaccumulate 
metals and metalloids are known, with most of them accumulating either Al, Ni, 
Mn, or Zn, and have potential for phytomining (Reeves et al. 2021; Reeves 2003). 
Most of the Ni-hyperaccumulator plants belong to Brassicaceae family. The highest 
Ni-concentrations and bioaccumulation factors are found in the genera Bornmuellera, 
Odontarrhena, and Noccaea. The Mediterranean region is considered a global cen￾ter of distribution for Ni-hyperaccumulator plants, mainly involving species in the 
genus Odontarrhena (Bani et al. 2021; Jakovljević et al. 2022). To date, a total of 31 
hyperaccumulator plant species have been identifed in the Balkans, the center of 
diversity and speciation in the European fora which is particularly rich in ultramafc 
areas and the majority are distributed in Albania (Bianchi et al. 2022). In Albania, 
Ni-hyperaccumulation ability is phylogenetically restricted to Alysseae (Bani et al. 
2015a). Seven taxa from Alysseae (Odontarrhena albifora, O. chalcidica, O. mora￾vensis, O. sibirica, O. decipiens, O. smolikana subsp. glabra, and O. rigida) were 
checked for Ni concentrations to assess accumulation levels of their populations
(Wang et al. 2021). The results demonstrated that the tetraploids O. chalcidica and 
O. decipiens are the most promising candidates for phytomining/agromining, espe￾cially the latter for its robust habit (Cecchi et al. 2018). However, the only feld trial 
carried out to date in Albania is done using Odontarrhena chalcidica (syn. Alyssum 
murale s.l.) (Kidd et al. 2018; Bani et al. 2015b, 2013) and the results confrmed that 
the success of phytomining/agromining is in direct relation to a metal concentration 
in crop tissues and a high biomass yield.
Ni Phytoextraction Usually, Ni concentrations in hyperaccumulator plants are 
variable depending on the species accumulation abilities and metal concentrations 
in the soil where they grow. Such variation is mentioned even at the level of species 
populations. In case of Odontarrhena chalcidica in Albania it was also confrmed 
(Osmani et al. 2015, 2018; Xhaferri et al. 2018; Bani et al. 2009; Shallari et al. 
1998; Wang et al. 2020). Phytoextraction of Ni shown by O. chalcidica is different 
in city sites with ultramafc soils and industrially contaminated sites. The data 
received by Osmani et al. (2018) for the fraction of available Ni in the mining area 
of Përrenjas show lower Ni than in the ultramafc (serpentine) area. The concentra￾tion of Ni in O. chalcidica (sub A. murale) is lower than found by Bani et al. (2009) 
in other sites of the Përrenjas region, but similar to the specimens sampled (i.e., 
1508 mg kg−1
) in the same post-mining site by Shallari et al. (1998). Probably, the 
Ca competition in such Ca-defcient soils and Mg:Ca ratio of the soil have a strong 
infuence in Ni absorption, translocation, and hyperaccumulation.
Also, Osmani and Bani (2017) demonstrated NiDTPA removed by O. chalcidica
from Përrenjas industrial site was higher (17–32%) compared to extracted Ni from 
Elbasan industrial dumpsite (8.7–29%). The authors calculate 0.4–1.8 mg kg−1
 Ni 
that is removed for the period of 120 days by O. chalcidica (sub A. murale) grown 
on the soil of Përrenjas industrial sites and 0.39–1.24 mg kg−1
 for Elbasan industrial 
A. Bani et al.139
sites and conclude that long cultivation reduces Ni DTPA in the soil and confrms 
higher accumulation potential of O. chalcidica in comparison to Trifolium repens.
To optimize extraction process and improve the phytomining/agromining, differ￾ent aspects of agronomy are experimented and applied, such as changes in soil pH, 
amendment of “vegetative soil”, mineral fertilizers, manure, еtc. The authors con￾clude that O. chalcidica could be a useful candidate for phytoextraction technolo￾gies ex-situ not only on ultramafc soils, but also on contaminated soils. Their 
experiments show more effective Ni phytoextraction when 50% of “vegetation soil” 
is added to the industrial soil instead of manure.
Nickel concentration in plant material is in direct relation to the phenological 
stage of the species. The experimental data with O. chalcidica collected from the 
ultramafc area of Përrenjas demonstrate that maximal Ni concentration is reached 
at the end of the fowering period and at the beginning of the fruiting stage for all 
populations and higher in soils with high available nickel (Xhaferri et al. 2018). The 
highest level of Ni in the entire plant of O. chalcidica (sub A. murale) is found in the 
populations of the ultramafc site Fushe Rajce (Xhaferri et al. 2018). It is demon￾strated that Ni accumulation from species is different in plant organs and tissues. 
The order of measured Ni concentrations in plant organs of O. chalcidica is leaves 
> fowers >entire plant (Xhaferri et al. 2018).
The phytoextraction in the former mining area of Përrenjas leads to the depletion 
of the labile pool of Ni and to the improvement of the physical properties of the soil. 
Therefore, an increase in labile forms of metals and an increase in metal bioavail￾ability favors phytomining.
Plant Biomass, Ni Yield, and Ni Recovery Except from the metal concentration 
in plant the success of phytomining/agromining process is in relation to plant bio￾mass yield. Different factors such as climatic conditions, soil properties, and metal 
bioavailability can limit the production of plant biomass. Besides, a higher biomass 
can be harvested through the addition of various amendments such as inorganic 
fertilizers and organic amendments (compost, biochar, and animal waste) (Wang 
et al. 2021; Nkrumah et al. 2016). Mineral fertilization has a positive effect on the 
biomass production of Ni-hyperaccumulators and Ni yield due to nutrient def￾ciency of ultramafc soils (Kidd et al. 2018). Usually, phosphorus affects biomass 
and Ni uptake of hyperaccumulators including the stimulation of fowering, while 
application of nitrogen (N) is advisable to minimize excessive leaching of N to 
groundwater and to compensate soil nutrient absorption by the hyperaccumulator 
(Kidd et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2020). Our study for years showed that the biomass 
and Ni yields of O. chalcidica are high in Domosdova feld and Fushe Rajce ultra￾mafc sites, respectively: Domosdova feld 8.8 t ha−1
 biomass and 95.9 kg ha−1
 Ni 
yield; Fushe Rajce: 6 t ha−1
 biomass and 57 kg ha−1
 Ni yield. The results are more 
promising in case of feld experiments for a period of 5 years provided in Albania 
demonstrated that biomass and Ni yield are improved and reach biomass production 
9.96 t ha−1
 and Ni yield 145 kg ha−1
 (Kidd et al. 2018; Bani et al. 2013). In the case 
of ex-industrial sites, the biomass production and Ni yield are lower. So that in the 
experimental feld around ex-industrial site of Elbasan received biomass production 
8 Phytomining as a Nature-based Solution in the Cities of Albania140
was 11 t ha−1
 and Ni yield 11 kg ha−1
. From the biomass of O. chalcidica produced 
in Albanian soils ammonium nickel sulfate hexahydrate (ANSH) was obtained with 
99% purity. By drying and incinerating the Ni-rich biomass and a sequence of treat￾ments of the ashes (Houzelot et al. 2017; Sheoran et al. 2009) obtained 5–13% of Ni 
in the ash from incinerating Ni-hyperaccumulator plants, signifcantly higher than 
the Ni-concentrations in common (primary) ores (3%).
The results for biomass and Ni concentration in the plants O. chalcidica and 
Trifolium repens are presented for Përrenjas and Elbasan dumpsites when they are 
treated differently (Osmani and Bani 2017). In both dumpsites, adding 50% manure 
increases the plant biomass, but at the same time it decreases the Ni concentration 
in plants, because the concentration of nickel is diluted. The biomass of O. chal￾cidica grown in Elbasan dumpsite treated with fertilizer (diammonium phosphate) 
and manure show different results, higher when fertilizer is used (Lekaj et al. 2019). 
The authors conclude that the presence of nitrogen and phosphorous in the soil posi￾tively affects O. chalcidica growth, but potassium negatively. Also, they consider 
fertilization does not affect the concentration of Ni in plant tissues. Additionally, 
agromining practice in Albania shows that nitrogen-fxing species from Fabaceae 
included in the cropping system lead to a reduction in the use of fertilizers (Bani 
et al. 2021) and successfully applied co-cropping in some ultramafc sites. Moreover, 
hyperaccumulator plants are strongly resistant to pests and thus help to reduce the 
need for pesticide application.
Also, plant biomass can be higher altogether with the improvement of soil qual￾ity when soil microbial communities are stimulated (Kidd et al. 2018; Nkrumah 
et al. 2016) but future studies in this relation in Albania are required.
Revegetation Along with analyses of Ni concentrations and biomass production in 
Përrenjas ex-mining sites revegetation process was also studied. Usually, vegetation 
cover minimizes erosion and decreases toxic element migration to the groundwater. 
Natural revegetation of a mining-affected area may take hundreds of years, while 
phytomining offers a relatively fast approach for the restoration of degraded lands 
(i.e., cutting the restoration duration to several years) (Wang et al. 2021; Koszelnik￾Leszek et al. 2013). The studied area in Përrenjas is characterized by a relatively 
small number of plant species. Among the species 28.3% of the taxa are known to 
tolerate high levels of Ni in their growing substrate and the number of Ni-tolerant 
species depends on the accumulation abilities of the species (Osmani et al. 2018). 
Most of the plants showed slightly elevated Ni concentrations in comparison to 
those on other soil types, about 12–251 mg kg−1
, rather than 0.5–10 mg kg−1
 (Osmani 
et al. 2018). The analysis of metals performed on plant bulk shoots showed different 
plant responses to the presence of Ni, Ca, and Mg in the adjacent soils. The analysis 
of the taxonomical structure of the fora of the ex-mining sites in Përrenjas demon￾strates that Asteraceae (29.3% of all found species) is the richest in the species fam￾ily. In this family, the abundance of species characteristic for rocky heavy metal-rich 
areas found in other places in the world such as species from genera Centaurea, 
Artemisia, Sonchus, etc. prevail. The data presented by Osmani et al. (2018) show 
A. Bani et al.141
the percentage of the representatives of other families as follows: Lamiaceae (8.1%), 
Fabaceae (7.1%), Scrophulariaceae (7.1%), Boraginaceae (5.1%), Caryophyllaceae 
(6.1%), Brassicaceae (6.1%), Poaceae (3%), etc. These families were reported to 
occur on serpentine dumping grounds both in Poland and in Western Europe [40]. 
The highest Ni concentrations range between 150 and 250 mg kg−1
 for the local 
indicator species such as Cynoglossum offcinale, Alyssoides sinuata, A. utriculata, 
Medicago lupulina, Melilotus albus, and Polygonum persicaria. The only plant with 
hyperaccumulation ability is Odontarrhena chalcidica, naturally distributed in the 
neighboring serpentine sites. The serpentine-adapted species were the most com￾petitive which contributed to the colonization of the studied area and success of the 
phytoremediation in Albania. Plants from families like Caryophyllaceae, 
Polygonaceae, Poaceae, and Fabaceae have potential to grow in the hostile edaphic 
environment of serpentine soils and accumulate Ni in their tissues. Similar are the 
data provided by Osmani and Bani (2017) for Elbasan dumping sites where 
Ni-hyperaccumulator species O. chalcidica and Trifolium repens are suggested as 
suitable for revegetation.
Usually, the colonization of metalliferous substrates is related to the develop￾ment of a specifc fora and consecutive ecological succession which started with 
annual and biennial plants and later replaced by perennials, trees, and shrubs. The 
process of colonization depends on plant populations existing in the neighboring 
non-degraded areas which are the main source of diaspores. The lower number of 
species is explained as the recently initiated process of natural colonization and 
poor in nutrient elements soil. The presence of naturally distributed 
Ni-hyperaccumulator species (O. chalcidica) in Përrenjas ex-mining sites is of great 
importance. This species is one of the best known Ni-hyperaccumulators with good 
biomass production which guarantees the success of phytomining and preservation 
of biodiversity.
8.4 Conclusions
Phytomining Ni is NbS that can be applied in Albanian cities (Prrenjas, Elbasan). It 
can be regarded as a remediation strategy for both highly contaminated soils in the 
industrial zones and ultramafc soils. Although this green technology is more widely 
applicable in smelting and mining rural areas, it can be successfully applied in cases 
when cities are located in ultramafc areas with intensive mining activities, similar 
to those in Albania. The results of our studies confrm the successful application of 
phytoremediation as NbS in cities: (1) to revitalize the valuable soil resource and 
reuse the metals otherwise not utilized and thus counteract “linear” land use; (2) to 
enable urban greening and improve the living quality in urban areas; and (3) to 
apply urban agriculture.
Phytoremediation and phytomining of Ni in the cities of Albania are successful 
because of the natural distribution of Ni-hyperaccumulator plants such as O. 
8 Phytomining as a Nature-based Solution in the Cities of Albania142
chalcidica which is one of the best candidates for phytoextraction/phytomining of 
Ni from metalliferous serpentine soils. Applying naturally distributed plants for 
nature-based remediation method, there is no risk leading to disastrous effects on 
the local ecosystem by the biological invasion of non-native species and this pre￾serves biodiversity. The plants in the Ni-contaminated areas in southeast Albania are 
adapted to the physical and chemical properties of the metal-rich soils. Among the 
species in the study area, 28.3% of the taxa were known to tolerate high levels of Ni 
in their growing substrate. Our studies showed that the extraction of metals for sev￾eral years with Ni-hyperaccumulator plants in contaminated and ultramafc soils 
will enable the reuse of metals, improve soil affecting the ecosystems, and reduce 
imports of primary resources into the urban system.
Apart from applied nature-based remediation, our future work will be concen￾trated to combine phytoextraction processes with public recreation and thus make 
the lives of people in the areas healthy and pleasant.

Environment

Abstract With the growing population and rapid industrialization, water shortage 
is a serious problem for mankind. Every solution that provides usable and fresh 
water to those in need is important. No source of water can be ignored in the persua￾sion of a sustainable water supply. With this in mind, the feasible and economically 
affordable treatment of sewage water concept emerged.
As one study indicated, out of 72,000 MLD of wastewater that is generated in 
India, only 44% of it receives treatment. As freshwater sparsity increases day by 
day, it has become common to treat used water for use by humans for daily needs, 
animals, irrigation, and industrial processes. As such, various unique and efcient 
treatment methodologies have been developed by researchers and professionals 
worldwide. But these treatment methodologies have given rise to serious environ￾mental threats in terms of disposal issues which cannot be ignored in the focus of 
the circular economy.
As mentioned by Barry Commoner, a famous American Ecologist, and Biologist, 
the environmental cost of these treatment methodologies is enormous—be it energy 
cost, solid waste disposal cost, or land cost. Environmental innovation that pro￾motes nature-based technologies jeopardizes rms’ protability and sustainability 
of the treatment in the long term. This hesitation toward change is interfering with 
the widespread adaptation of NbS. It has been proven that NbS is far better at tack￾ling stakeholder satisfaction, long-term effects on the environment, reducing capital 
cost, and operation-ease adaptability of the system as compared to the latest tech￾nologies. The areas where NbS lacks advantage are automation, remote operation, 
and maintenance, real-time parameter monitoring. There is also little research on 
handling toxic materials, in highly turbid and saline waters. Further research is

needed in these areas. This is also a challenge to the policymakers to develop the 
construction guidelines and operating standards which will suit the local environment 
and demands of NbS. This is necessary to legalize the construction and operation of 
these systems.
When the question of adaptation of green technologies or circular economy sur￾faces, many industries prefer to adopt the 3R technique in their production methods, 
resulting in treatment technologies generating high quantities of solid, liquid, and 
gaseous waste. It has been documented that the adaptation of NbS leaves a negative 
impact on the industrial economy. These technologies pose quite a challenge in 
terms of land and the reuse of treated wastewater. The main reason is that there is no 
consistency in inlet quality and quantity of water. As the inlet water quality and 
quantity are unpredictable, the outlet water quality is unreliable. While this problem 
can be solved by imposing responsibility on any particular department or private 
authorities, the effectiveness of the measures is questionable.
This chapter discusses the various problems public authorities, lawmakers, and 
industrialists face. It also discusses how they are addressed in various parts of the 
world, and how with proper research, further improvements can be made.

9.1 Introduction
Urban areas everywhere in the world are facing challenges of pollution of water 
bodies by the open disposal of wastewater into rivers or lakes. It is not possible to 
collect a small quantity of waste in one place and treat it before disposal due to vari￾ous constraints like space, the willingness of users to maintain the plant, and mon￾etary investment. The varying nature of effuent quality is also a cause of concern. 
However, nature-based root zone technology-like treatment solutions have been 
proven very successful in tackling this problem.
Sludge disposal is no major issue in the case of such small capacity plants as root 
zone-based systems absorb the sludge and convert it into manure, some sludge dis￾posal collected at the inlet screen is an issue but that can be addressed by proper 
management of the inlet wastewater and periodic cleaning.
Treated water from the Root Zone Plant can be used to produce/develop Azolla 
Agricultural farming, which is also referred to as small duckweed plant. The Azolla 
Farming is used as Live Feed Stock, human food, medicine, and water purifer. In 
2015, as per the Government of India report (Goyal et al. n.d.), approximate sewage 
generation in the country is 61,754 MLD. Out of which only 37.18% means 22,963 
MLD water gets treatment and the rest 38,791 MLD means 62.82% untreated sew￾age is directly discharged into the environment, may it be open water body or 
river or sea.
S. B. Deshpande147
The root Zone Treatment Method follows law of the nature and is technically 
maintenance-free. It works on self-regulatory dynamics and provides a balance 
between natural systems like air, water, soil, and bacteria (Live creatures). That is 
why this treatment technology is fnding wider acceptability in developed and 
developing countries alike.
Many research studies (Wadstrom et al. 2023; Gholipour and Stefanakis 2021; 
Stefanakis et al. 2014; Gopalan et al. 2009; Vymazal 2007) were conducted in the 
past decades and also going on to establish the economic and ecological feasibility 
of these systems either large-scale or small-scale. About 105 m3
/day capacity plant 
in a college campus in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu (Raval and Desai 2015) is 
constructed in the Root Zone Technology Treatment method. It is built as a pure 
aerobic process and has no mechanical or electrical equipment. The sewage from 
the collection tank is fltered through a sand/gravel flter or steel mesh flter depend￾ing upon the type of suspended material in incoming sewage. The fltered water then 
enters the prepared reed bed or root zone where actual aerobic treatment of the sew￾age takes place. The water, after passing through this zone, is fltered in the planted 
gravel flter again. This fltered water is now ready for reuse and therefore collected 
in the fnal collection tank and supplied to the plantations or farmlands. The parti￾cles/sediments trapped in the stone flter or planted gravel flter are cleaned and 
scrapped periodically. The reed grows very fast producing large clumps of thick 
rhizomes. It helps to absorb nitrogen and soil control.
One of the studies (Tasneem et al. 2012) in the literature reviews the effect of 
recycling of kitchen wastewater through root zone technology. The study is per￾formed on the laboratory scale plant on an experiment basis. A combination of large 
and small gravel, coarse and fne sand, soil, and other materials like charcoal, phrag￾mites australis (Reed), and Typha Latifolia are used. Filter beds were found to be 
effective in removing pH, electrical conductivity, TDS, and BOD to the values per￾missible to the discharge in public sewers and surface water bodies. Among all the 
materials, the flter bed with Phragmites Australis (Reed) was found very effective 
in reducing pollution load. These flter beds however were not at all effective in 
reducing E-coli and therefore author has suggested using any other technology or 
strategy or process to reduce E-coli and odor from the effuent.
Pawaskar (2012) has proposed a modifed root zone system that can be effec￾tively used within the Nallah area to treat wastewater. This system is technically and 
economically more feasible than the traditional system. The modifed Root Zone 
system required less footprint area than the conventional system and proved to be a 
technically and economically feasible option according to the study. It is proved that 
this system can handle a variety of pollutants with removal effciency ranging from 
79.45% (BOD), 79.45% (COD), and 83.07% (TSS).
In one more research study (Raval and Desai 2015), the authors assessed the 
pathogen removal potential of the Root Zone technology from domestic wastewater. 
A combination of biological, physical, and chemical factors is responsible for the 
removal of pathogens in the wastewater. These processes include sedimentation and 
chemical reactions, natural decay and predation by water animals (zooplankton), 
and the biological substances released in the plant root zone. The effectiveness of 
9 Nature-based Wastewater Treatment Systems: An Overview of the Challenges…148
these factors varies as per the wastewater fow rate, nature of the microphytes, and 
type of wetland. Therefore, each of the root zone systems is unique in the results of 
pathogen removal. The study was conducted on the following types of bacteria 
found in domestic wastewater, Total Coliform, Fecal Coliform, Salmonella 
Detection, Shigella Detection, and Vibrio Detection. Results were observed for the 
rainy, winter, and summer seasons. It is concluded from the above experiments that 
Constructed Wetlands provide aerobic conditions for microbial respiration to 
degrade organic matter due to photosynthesis by algae and oxygen and diffusion 
from the roots of the plant on the bed. The study strongly recommends Constructed 
Wetlands for the treatment of domestic wastewater for the removal of pathogen 
bacteria and other pollutants.
One more pilot scale study (Vymazal 2005) revealed that when conventional 
treatment methods cost Rs. 12  =  00 per 1000  L for operation and maintenance, 
plants based on Root Zone Technology cost around Rs. 4.13 per 1000  L (2012 
basis). This means it is very cost-competitive for small-capacity and isolated plants, 
whereas investing in large-capacity plants is practically not possible.
A research study (Kakwani and Pradip 2020) was conducted on seasonal varia￾tion in treatment effciency of subsurface horizontal fow constructed wetlands 
using aquatic macrophytes. The wetland ecosystem is very much dependent on 
evapotranspiration and naturally seasonal variations infuence it greatly. This proves 
the uniqueness of each root zone technology concerning local conditions as men￾tioned earlier in this chapter.
Constructed wetlands are an effective and environmentally friendly means of 
treating liquid and solid waste (Stefanakis 2022, 2020; Nielsen and Stefanakis 2020; 
Schultze-Nobre et al. 2017; Gaballah et al. 2021). Constructed wetlands could bring 
major economic benefts to developing countries through the provision of biomass 
and aquaculture. Such wetland systems can yield a signifcant proft for the local 
communities and might be a powerful tool for breaking the poverty cycle. 
Constructed wetlands are effective at reducing BOD/COD, nitrogen, phosphorus, 
and suspended solids load by up to 98% (Al-Wahaibi et al. 2021; Gaballah et al. 
2022). However, despite the suitability of climate in developing countries, the 
spread of wetlands in such areas has been depressingly slow.
9.2 Materials and Methods
Nature-based wastewater systems have been in operation for a long time on this 
planet; however, depending on the availability of the construction material and pur￾pose of the end-use water, physical changes have been introduced by the users. The 
following are the most common types of construction methods of these systems. 
Figures 9.1 and 9.2 show the setup for water treatment used for the rejuvenation of 
the village pond in India (Gaballah et al. 2022).

9.2.1 Reed Bed Filter/Planted Graywater Filter
It is one of the natural and cheap methods of treating domestic, industrial, and agri￾cultural liquid wastes. Reeds are coarse grasses that grow naturally in a wetland. 
They can take up pollutants from the soil. Reed beds are considered as an effective 
and reliable secondary and tertiary treatment method where land area is not a major 
constraint. Generally, a reed bed has shallow pits, installed with an inlet or outlet in 
a bed of limestones, pebbles, and graded sand.
In this porous bed, reed plants with hollow roots bring oxygen into the flter bed. 
Two types of reed bed flters are available: horizontal and vertical horizontal fow 
flters. The horizontal graywater flter uses gravel as flter material. The water fows 
horizontally across vertical gravel and stone layers. The horizontal fow allows a fat 
construction but requires more space compared to the vertical graywater flter.
9 Nature-based Wastewater Treatment Systems: An Overview of the Challenges…150
The basin can be built in the soil as long as the outfow pipe ends up above the 
ground. The height difference required between the infow pipe and outfow pipe of 
the flter is a minimum of 5 cm. Within this construction, even pipes from graywater 
sources that are low above the ground can be handled if the groundwater level 
allows an excavation. Figure 9.3 shows a cross-section of the horizontal, planted 
gravel flter design.
Roots of reed plants provide a favorable environment for bacteria, which take 
dissolved organic matter and thus the BOD load is further reduced. A horizontal 
planted flter is simple in principle and requires almost no maintenance. However, 
design and construction require a thorough understanding of the treatment process 
and knowledge of the flter medium. Planted flters are suitable for pre-treated (pre￾settled) domestic or industrial wastewater of COD content not higher than 500 mg/L 
(CPCB 2019; APHA 1992). Wastewater must be pretreated especially for suspended 
solids to prevent the clogging of flter media. The flter bed should not be deeper 
than the depth to which plants’ roots can grow (30–60 cm), as water tends to fow 
faster below the dense bed of roots. Shallow flters are more effective compared to 
deeper beds of the same volume. To prevent percolation of wastewater in-ground, 
the bottom must be sealed. While the top part of the flter media in a planted flter is 
kept horizontal, constructed bottom slopes down from inlet to outlet prefera￾bly by 1%.
Vertical fow flter as shown in Fig. 9.4 is a reed-bed flter in which the effuent 
is periodically spread uniformly over the surface of the bed through a network of 
Fig. 9.3 Cross section and plan of horizontal fow planted gravel flter. (Source: NIH, Roorkee)

pipes (Al-Wahaibi et al. 2021; Zahui et al. 2021). The matrix of the bed is made up 
of layers of sand and gravel. The effuent drains down vertically through the bed 
with air replacing the wastewater in the bed as it drains. The next dose traps the air 
which leads to a highly aerated system with good oxygen transfer permitting 
increased microbial growth and activity. The water is collected by drainage pipes at 
the bottom which discharges to the next reed bed or directly into a water body. The 
bed then remains empty of water until the next dose is applied. Hence, unlike the 
horizontal flters, vertical fow is not constantly fooded but free draining. Vertical 
fow reed beds are designed to be aerobic and to nitrify ammonia converting it into 
nitrates and nitrites. Therefore, they can cope with higher pollutant loads.
9.2.2 Floating Treatment Wetlands (FTWs)
FTWs or islands are small artifcial platforms as shown in Fig. 9.5 that allow aquatic 
emergent plants to grow in water that is typically too deep for them to survive. The 
roots of these plants take up nutrients and contaminants themselves. The plant roots 
grow down into the water creating dense columns of roots with lots of surface area. 
Thus, the foating island material and dense roots provide extensive surface area for 
microbes to grow  – forming a slimy layer of bioflm. The bioflm is where the 
majority of nutrient uptake and degradation occurs in an FTW system as shown in 
Fig. 9.6 (IISD 2021). The shelter provided by the foating mat also allows sediment 
and elements to settle by reducing turbulence and mixing by wind and waves. The 
unique ecosystem has the potential to capture nutrients and transform common pol￾lutants into harmless by-products.

9.2.3 Physical Treatment
These are non-mechanized, low-operation maintenance fltration units using physi￾cal methods to provide treatment to wastewater to bring it under the discharge stan￾dards (IS 2296:1992). These will generally work on the principles of the sand and 
gravel flters replicating the natural soil principles of soil fltration.
A. Screen chambers: These are simple square or rectangular chambers to flter out 
large solid particles and generally have a screen or mesh through which the 
water passes.
B. Silt traps: In the inlet channel as shown in Fig. 9.7, a sediment or silt basin can 
be developed to trap the incoming sediment. In the upstream end of the silt 
basin, trap mesh can be installed to flter the infow of foating materials includ￾ing polythene, plastic bottles, coconut shell, etc. The size can vary according to 
the quantum of incoming pollutants involved in foating wetland treatment 
water. At the downstream end of the silt basin, a flter with gabion structure can 
be developed, so that any other lighter and small material which would pass 
through the screen chambers and silt basin would be fltered there.
S. B. Deshpande153
C. Sedimentation tank/basin: These are large tanks as shown in Fig. 9.8 that hold 
the incoming water for a long enough duration to allow silt to settle down. These 
need to be designed considering the quantum of infowing water. A tank/basin is 
generally rectangular but can be of any other shape as per the availability of 
land. They can be made of concrete, brickwork, or small trenches lined with 
nonporous material.
Root zone technology is a fltration system that works on biological principles. 
The plants’ roots in soil volume treat wastewater. The bacteria in the soil also help 
in this process. The root zone technology’s success is dependent on the proper selec￾tion of plant species. Table 9.1 shows the plant species preferred in different parts of 
the world. In India being an agriculture-based country, many plant varieties are 
used. Some of the popular plant species are Cattail, Acacia, Canna, Reeds, etc. 
During the treatment, impurities in wastewater like solids, and heavy metals are 
bound to the soil and released into the atmosphere through nitrifcation and denitri￾fcation processes. The processes are aerobic, anaerobic, and anoxic depending on 
the microbial presence and activities. The process design norms and physical sizing 
parameters of these plants are shown in Table 9.2. These are to be treated for refer￾ence purposes only as case-to-case basis design changes are possible.
The aerobic activity is supplied with oxygen from the plant roots as well as via 
the surface of the system. Thus, aerobic activity is concentrated near the plant 
roots, while anaerobic activity prevails at some distance from the roots. This 
system of aerobic and anaerobic processes provides necessary conditions for a

wide range of active microbial organisms. Aerobic as well as anaerobic groups of 
organisms are required for the wastewater pollutants to degrade. In the biological 
treatment process for conventional STP, both aerobic and anaerobic processes 
occur in different places, however, in root zone technology, both processes occur at 
the same locations.
9.2.4 Case Study at Kham Eco Park
The Kham River, in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state in India, which 
fows through the city, is in a very bad state concerning environmental degradation. 
The seasonal variation of fow and neglected maintenance has made the situation 
worse. The impact on the surrounding is directly related to the degradation of fora 
and fauna and soil and water quality. The local municipal authority is trying to 
develop the area by rejuvenating the stretches of river step by step as shown in 
Fig. 9.9. In this study program, it is planned to develop a nature-based root one type 
STP for the sewage entering in the river from the surrounding area. The proposed 
STP plan was displayed at the site as shown in Figs. 9.10 and 9.11.
The water bodies in the river bed-like ponds were also in bad shape as shown in 
Fig. 9.12.
The team worked very hard on site and with involvement from local communi￾ties the inauguration of STP plant construction started as shown in Fig. 9.13.
When it is decided to construct STP based on root zone technology, the water 
analysis of almost 16 points along the river bed is planned. A few locations could be

seen from Figs. 9.14, 9.15, 9.16, 9.17, 9.18, and 9.19. The analysis was the basis of 
the STP design. Based on experience and discussions with experts in this feld STP 
design is fnalized. Easily available local material is selected to construct 
STP. Figure 9.20 is the piece of effuent collection pipe. An open drain pipe is used

for the collection of wastewaters from Tabela. Since it contains very high solids, an 
open drain was found to be the best choice to avoid maintenance problems. All the 
design, either sizing or material selection is based on considering future operation 
and maintenance. It was very encouraging to see the participation of the local com￾munity in the construction stage, operation, and maintenance stages. The queries 
raised by locals during training were very thoughtful and confdence-building to the 
author and team. Though this was the very frst attempt to construct an STP plant 
with people’s involvement, it was a very fulflling experience for the team.
After the collection of samples the testing of parameters is done at two labs par￾allelly to confrm the results. Laboratory setup is inspected and testing is physically 
inspected as per Figs.  9.18 and 9.19. The testing is done as per APHA and IS 
standards.
The rating scale for pollution is used as per Table 9.3.
The wastewater analysis at the inlet of STP is as per Table 9.4.
After the analysis of all the samples summarily, it was observed that:
1. Freshwater shows the presence of biological and chemical load and that makes 
it unusable without treatment.
2. The river bed water is full of sewage water with the presence of E-coli.
3. A load of total suspended solids or turbidity is not a cause of concern as most of 
the solids are more settable in nature than colloidal ones.
4. Presence of biological nitrogen, biological phosphorus, and sulfates is seen and 
that is a cause of vegetation growth in ponds and lakes.
5. Total dissolved solids are quite high and indicate an infux of groundwater with 
contamination of minerals.
6. Traces of acidic water in the Jangali Mahadev Mandir area, Siddharth Garden 
(Sangam) show an infux of industrial effuent and need to be investigated 
further.
7. The seasonal variations will make changes in the pollution load, rainwater/
stormwater will carry the pollution over a larger area and therefore there is a 
need to channel the stormwater, otherwise it will be a great risk to the environ￾ment and humans settling around the area.
8. The localized hotspots of pollution generating concentrated load along the river 
need to be identifed and studied in detail, such as Tabela drains. The provision 
of decentralized STPs that will be low-cost, easy to operate, and generate fertil￾izer through Vermicompost or any other method needs to be initiated.
9.3 Results and Discussion
The above project is the author’s frst attempt to construct a 6000 L/day STP plant 
on the ground after numerous laboratory-size trials. It was very challenging to study 
the area and select representative areas that will refect the correct pollution and 
degradation level of the Kham River stretch consideration. It is now well established

a scheme. The author is very satisfed to observe the presence of local bodies in 
every stage of the execution of this project. The construction work was entrusted to 
a local construction frm and that helped to use local materials in the construction.

were used along the riverside pathway. The wastewater analysis is mentioned in

mentioned in Table 9.3. In all 16 points, locations where wastewater analysis is car￾ried out, water quality was found to be very bad. However, the treated water quality 
as shown in Fig. 9.25 is very good. The reduction of BOD and COD was up to 
80–95% and SS reduction was almost 92%. The treated water through this root zone 
STP is being used for irrigation and extra water is being let out in the river.
Even though the results in the frst feld trial are encouraging, it will lead us to 
many studies in the future which are based on the latest technologies like AI/
ML. The studies that we are looking forward to are below:
1. Nutrient mapping in soil
2. Seasonal variations in fow and water quality parameters.
3. Impact of changing weather conditions.
As a way forward, AI/ML algorithm modeling can be applied to identify the 
sources of pollution in the Kham River. Principal component analysis (PCA)/factor 
analysis (FA) can be performed using log-transformed data to identify the factor(s) 
that infuence the water quality during the entire sampling period and within the 
seasons (autumn, winter, and summer). Through the hierarchical cluster analysis of 
the sampling sites, these sites could be grouped into three clusters based on water 
quality, which can be categorized as low, moderate, and high pollution areas. 
Principal component analysis (PCA) could be applied to the entire dataset to iden￾tify four or more principal components showing major variations in quality like pH, 
conductivity, TP, and NO3-N as the key parameters responsible for variations in 
water quality. This will help to indicate that some of the sampling locations in the

Kham River are heavily contaminated with pollutants from various sources which 
can be correlated with land use patterns and anthropogenic activities.
Accurate prediction of independent and dependent factors as per seasonal varia￾tions will help predict the success of root zone technology treatment systems. This 
will help many economically deprived communities to opt for such systems without 
much hassle.
9.4 Conclusion
Nature-based systems have been used by people for decades. Knowledge about the 
processes and technology being used is now well-known to many communities in 
various parts of the world. These technologies could be the frst step in adapting to 
a circular economy and sustainable development and support in achieving SDGs 
(Kakwani and Kalbar 2022, 2020). However, the adaptation is not uniform. The use 
of local construction materials and local plants needs to be studied and investigated 
further to get the required effciency from the treatment plant. The participation of 
the local community is very much essential in the operation and maintenance of the 
plant. The identifcation of pollution hotspots and mapping those in existing net￾works is important for making the plants more effective and effcient. The support 
from local government in identifying isolated effuent sources and providing neces￾sary infrastructure is very important.
The next task for the author and her team will be to work on models based on AI 
and ML. As can be seen, tons of data are available on plants, soil structure, and sew￾age quality concerning seasonal variations. This data can be used as preliminary 
data to develop an intelligent model and predict the results as per that. This will help 
to customize the technology and review its results for various locations and geo￾graphical areas.

Bioremediation of Wastewater 
from the Tanning Industry Under 
a Circular Economy Model
Nayeli Montalvo-Romero, Aarón Montiel-Rosales, Luis Carlos Sandoval￾Herazo, and Rubén Purroy-Vásquez
Abstract The pollution generated by wastewater discharges from the leather tan￾ning industry generates various diseases and negatively affects ora and fauna. The 
tanning industry is responsible for processing leather into leather. However, the 
wastewater from tanneries is considered toxic since it contains a high organic load, 
acidic waters with chromium, and dissolved salt, among other malignant compo￾nents. It is estimated that 20100 L of water are required for every kilo of skin pro￾cessed. In 2015, FAO estimated a global production of 366,867 thousand pieces, 
representing a signicant water resource. It is, then, the objective of the chapter to 
discuss the mechanism of bioremediation of wastewater from the tanning industry 
supported by the model of Circular Economy as a treatment strategy. Bioremediation 
is presented as a biotechnological approach capable of eliminating toxic contami￾nants. These processes are preferred over others, being friendly and non-invasive to 
the environment. It is then bioremediation, a strategy that allows recovering treated 
water for various purposes. It is established that bioremediation addresses the man￾agement of toxic agents and polluting processes while paying for the care of water 
and health under a framework of eco-efciency in tanneries.

10.1 Introduction
Of the wastewater from households, cities, and industry, 80% is discharged into the 
environment without adequate treatment (UN-Water 2021). Contaminated water is 
a factor that can transmit various diseases, e.g., cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, 
polio, and hepatitis A. In addition, it is estimated that contamination of drinking 
water causes more than 502,000 deaths from diarrhea per year (World Health 
Organization 2019).
According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 
(UNDESA), water is considered the center of sustainable development and is con￾sidered a fundamental factor for socio-economic development, healthy ecosystems, 
and the very survival of humanity. In addition, it reduces morbidity, and improves 
the health, well-being, and productivity of nations (United Nations 2015). Water use 
effciency has been highlighted as a critical indicator in the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) (UN-Water 2021).
In 2015, in the 42 countries (representing 18% of the world’s population) that 
reported on the generation and treatment of total wastewater fows, 32% received at 
least some treatment. The proportion of treated industrial wastewater fow was 30% 
(UN-Habitat and WHO 2021). In 2018, the industrial sector had a water use eff￾ciency equivalent to USD 32/m3
, the service sector USD 112/m3, and the agriculture 
sector USD 0.60/m3
; compared to 2015, this represents an increase of 15% in the 
industrial sector, 8% in the service sector, and 8% in the agricultural sector (FAO 
and UN-Water 2021).
Data from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) system, AQUASTAT 
shows that about 3928 km3
 of fresh water are extracted each year in the world; of 
which, it is estimated that 44% (1716 km3
 per year) is consumed in agriculture, the 
remaining 56% (2212 km3
 per year) is released into the environment as wastewater 
in the form of municipal and industrial effuents and agricultural drainage water 
(UN-Water 2017). According to the UN (United Nations), wastewater comprises 
approximately 99% water and 1% dissolved, colloidal, and suspended solids 
(UN-Water 2017).
In Mexico, according to INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) 
and CONAGUA (National Water Commission), the overexploitation of aquifers is a 
severe problem that has been increasing since 1975, there were 32 aquifers in this 
condition; in 2004, there were 104, and in 2019 there were 157; however, water 
contamination can cause intestinal infectious diseases; in 2019, in our country, these 
conditions were the sixth cause of death in children under one-year-old, registering 
353 deaths; water is contaminated by industrial, hazardous, solid and/or domestic 
waste. Industrial waste is organic and inorganic waste produced by industrial or 
commercial enterprises in their production processes (INEGI and CONAGUA 2018a).
In Mexico, 76% of water is used in agriculture, 14% in public supply, 5% in 
thermoelectric plants, and 5% in industry (INEGI and CONAGUA 2018b). Now, in 
Mexico, according to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources 
(SEMARNAT 2010), one of the industrial sectors that generate pollution to the 
N. Montalvo-Romero et al.171
environment is the leather industry; this sector generates waste of “defesh”, 
“scrape”, chrome leather dust and trimming; in addition, it contaminates water with 
salts, chromium, organic matter, fats, vegetable and synthetic tannins, and the air 
with dust, gases, and fumes.
In Comisión Estatal del Agua (2014), it is mentioned that the leather tanning 
industry can well be considered―due to the type of waste it generates throughout 
its production process―as one of the most polluting. This industry is a pillar of the 
economy in several states of the country. Generally, the wastewater generated from 
the tannery process is discharged into the municipal waters of the city without treat￾ment, where it is mixed with other waste to join the aquifers fnally. The liquid 
effuents of the tanning industry have high concentrations of organic matter, nitro￾gen compounds, sulfdes, high pH, suspended solids and chromium compounds. 
Therefore, the high load of organic matter causes the creation of anaerobic condi￾tions of biodegradation, due to the high consumption of dissolved oxygen, then, 
these conditions in addition to affecting aquatic life, they favor the production of 
some harmful gases such as, e.g., hydrogen sulfde, carbon dioxide, and methane. 
Moreover, the leather manufacturing industry has signifcant environmental impacts 
(Sawalha et al. 2019).
The leather industries consume a large amount of fresh water and various chemi￾cals during the leather-making process and expel different solid waste materials, 
hides, polishing powder materials, and sewage sludge; in addition, the industrial 
leather waste contains a signifcant amount of hazardous substances such as heavy 
metals (e.g., cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, and cobalt), aluminum sulfate, and 
magnesium oxide; unsafe disposal of sewage sludge creates serious environmental 
problems in soil and groundwater (Yuvaraj et al. 2020). It is estimated that between 
20 and 100  m3
 of water is consumed per ton of raw skin processed (Lorber 
et al. 2007).
Waste disposal after leather tanning has become a cause of concern worldwide, 
as conventional disposal methods are not viable for tanned leather waste, such as 
conversion from Cr3+ to Cr6+, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxide, and ammonia emis￾sions (Rosu et al. 2018).
The industrial process of leather begins with the slaughter of livestock, through 
refrigeration, until its commercialization, either tanned, semi-fnished, or fnished 
leather (Dussel Peters and Cárdenas Castro 2018). According to DENUE 2021 
(INEGI 2021), the tanning and fnishing of leather and leather recorded 1023 eco￾nomic units. The states with the highest number of economic units were Guanajuato 
(757), Jalisco (103), and Michoacán de Ocampo (20).
There are two main types of tanning: (a) vegetable tanning―these leathers 
become contact with water and are generally used in the manufacture of shoe soles, 
straps, luggage, and upholstery―are based on the use of tannins extracted from the 
bark, leaves, and fruits of some trees and (b) chrome tanning―this type of tanning, 
It is currently the most used where leathers are known as “wet blue”, since they are 
lighter, these leathers are used in the production of footwear, clothing, manufac￾tures, and industrial articles―, this type of skin is immersed in saline and acid solu￾tion, to be subsequently bathed in a solution of chromium sulfate (UTEPI 2008).
10 Bioremediation of Wastewater from the Tanning Industry Under a Circular…172
Chromium (Cr) is one of the most important environmental concerns related to 
tanneries. The most used process for leather tanning is chrome tanning; this implies 
the presence of chromium in both wastewater and leather waste; leather waste must 
be disposed of in landflls; which entails a considerable environmental impact and 
high cost (Zuriaga-Agustí et al. 2015).
The tannery industry generates a large amount of waste with a high concentra￾tion of Cr, being classifed as hazardous waste (Bizzi et al. 2020), not only for the 
environment but also for living organisms, including humans, due to their potential 
toxicity (Pecha et al. 2021); tannery sludge (Ts) and chrome-tanned leather shav￾ings (CTLs) are considered hazardous waste, which is produced considerably in 
industrial activities (Long et al. 2021). It is estimated that leather processing pro￾duces 200 times more waste than the total production of the product (Chojnacka 
et al. 2021); therefore, solid, liquid, and gaseous emissions from the sector cause an 
imbalance in the environment (Kanagaraj et al. 2020). Leather wastewater contains 
several toxic pollutants, with a high concentration of trivalent chromium (Cr(III)), 
adversely affecting wastewater treatment (Wang et al. 2021). In this sense, develop￾ing alternative treatments for these wastes, which are environmentally friendly, are 
important research topics.
Based on the above, this chapter analyzes and discusses the biotechnology strat￾egy of bioremediation as a management mechanism for the reuse of wastewater 
from the tanning industry aligned with the Circular Economy model, able to remove 
toxic contaminants from tannery wastewater and its viable reuse of treated water in 
the same tanning process.
In addition to Sect. 10.1 “Introduction”, the chapter is integrated from Sect. 10.2
“Materials and Methods”, which establishes the methodological approach used to 
analyze the feasibility of bioremediation in the tannery sector; Section 10.3
“Results”, describes the implications for the adoption of bioremediation as a mech￾anism of the Circular Economy; Section 10.4 “Discussion”, analyzes the fndings of 
the results based on the results reported by the scientifc community; fnally, Section 
10.5 “Conclusions”, establishes the contribution of the chapter in the management 
of wastewater from bioremediation under a Circular Economy scheme.
10.2 Materials and Methods
Figure 10.1 describes the methodological approach used in this study. The analysis 
strategy involves (a) explaining the operational process of leather tanning, (b) iden￾tifying the parameters of the wastewater components of the tanning process, (c) 
evaluating the bioremediation biotechnologies applied in wastewater treatment, and 
(d) analyzing the implications on the impacts from the Circular Economy model―
environment, economic and social―.

10.3 Results
This section describes the results of the fndings. This section is subdivided into four 
sections of the established methodology.
10.3.1 Identifcation of the Tanning Process
Leather is a natural biopolymer manufactured by stabilizing the skin’s protein 
against attack by microbes, acids, alkalis, and heat using chemical crosslinkers 
called tanning agents (Renganath Rao et al. 2021). The leather process consists of 
four main processing phases: (i) ribera (rehydration, cleaning, and hair removal), 
(ii) tanning (stabilizing collagen protein to transform skin into leather), (iii) post￾tanning (provides the proper texture, feel, color, and structural properties), and (iv) 
leather fnishing (adding sensory properties to leather); the post-tanning stage is 
carried out in aqueous medium in rotating drums and consists of the chemical pro￾cesses of deacidulation, retanning, dyeing, lubrication, and fxation (Hansen et al. 
2021a). According to Hansen et al. (2021b), the transformation of raw hides into 
fnished leather involves subjecting the hides to a series of physical, physicochemi￾cal, and chemical operations; physicochemical and chemical operations are carried 
out in an aqueous medium―wet operations―using rotating drums and producing 
liquid effuents; washes are also performed during wet operations, consuming water 
and producing additional liquid effuents.
10.3.2 Wastewater Characteristics
The wastewater from the tannery is highly toxic, characterized mainly by the values 
shown in Table 10.1.

Considering the above, wastewater from the tanning industry represents a high 
level of organic pollutants represented by COD concentrations above 3000 mg L−1
, 
with trivalent chromium, sulfde, and sodium chloride (Houshyar et al. 2012).
10.3.3 Evaluation of Bioremediation Techniques
Bioremediation is an approach to cleaning up polluted environments (Iwamoto and 
Nasu 2001); from biodegradable processes, usually using microorganisms (Gallego 
et  al. 2001), focused on eliminating, attenuating or transforming polluting sub￾stances through biological processes (Lynch and Moffat 2005); being a safe proce￾dure in the fght against the anthropogenic (Paliwal et al. 2012). Bioremediation has 
cleaning applications in contaminated soil water, sludge, and waste streams 
(Boopathy 2000).
Bioremediation is a novel approach; various bioprocesses have been developed 
and applied. Therefore, it is of interest to this study to know the most recent trends 
and identify the potential of bioremediation techniques in the waters of the tanning 
industry of the last decade, as it is a precious resource for this sector, with a view to 
its potential reuse.
Sharma and Malaviya (2016) present a consortium of ascomycetous fungi 
(Cladosporeum perangustum, Penicillium commune, Paecilomyces lilacinus, and 
Fusarium equiseti) by nylon mesh in a bioreactor; the authors report a reduction of 
up to 82.52% of COD, the color of 86.19%, Cr(VI) of 100%, Total Cr of 99.92% 
and Total Pb of 95.91%. In Das et al. (2017), phycoremediation is presented as a 
culture of the green microalgae strain, Chlorella vulgaris; the crop eliminated 100% 
Cr, COD at 94.74%, and BOD at 95.93%. The consortium Chlorella sp. and 
Phormidium sp., tested by Das et al. (2018), reduced Cr from between 90.17% and 
94.45%, COD and BOD from ≥90%. Sharma and Malaviya (2013) cultivated 
Aspergillus Niger SPFSL 2-a in wastewater, obtaining a reduction of COD of 
81.58%, TSS of 92.55%, and electrical conductivity of 11.90%.
A tightening approach with activated charcoal promoted the growth of Chlorella 
protothecoides, with an absorption of Cr(III) achieving an elimination of 99.6% 
(Sforza et al. 2020). In Sharma and Malaviya (2014), Fusarium chlamydosporium
SPFS2-g is used as a means of treatment, obtaining a reduction of 71.80% in COD, 
100% of Cr, and 36.47% of TSS. Suresh et al. (2021) assess the ability of Bacillus 
thuringiensis and Staphylococcus capitis to detoxify Cr(VI), and the results show 
that these bacteria can remove it by 86.42 and 97.34%, respectively. Whereas Adam 
et al. (2015) evaluated the performance of fve marine microalgae, removing Cr as 
follows: 25.2% Chlorella marina, 5.49% Isochrysis galbana, 34.0% Tetraselmis
sp., 13.1% Nannochloropsis salina, and 16.4% Dunaliella salina. In Ashraf et al. 
(2018), 11 bacterial strains are presented in the bio-treatment of wastewater; of 
these, the authors report that Enterobacter sp. HU38, Microbacterium arborescens
HU33, and Pantoea stewartii ASI11, remove Cr by 70, 63, 57, 87, and 54%, 
respectively.
10 Bioremediation of Wastewater from the Tanning Industry Under a Circular…176
Vijayaraj et al. (2018) report that Citrobacter freundii can remove Cr by 73%, 
COD and BOD by 80 and 86%, respectively. In Vijayaraj et al. (2020), Marinobacter 
hydrochoclasticus, a marine bacterium, can reduce Cr by 88% and COD by 69%. 
Chaudhary et  al. (2019) studied the fungal strain Aspergillus fumigatus MCC 
1175 in the remediation of the Cr with an effciency of 65.1%. In Fitriyanto et al. 
(2021), Fenton is used as a bioremediation agent, reducing COD by 66.7%, Cr by 
11.8%, and Cr(VI) by 11.5%.
10.3.3.1 Other Techniques
Some approaches in the treatment of tanning process residues imply, e.g., that waste 
collagen fber (WCF) from non-chrome-plated metal complex-tanned leather chips 
was converted to bio-additive (DCH) through catalytic oxidation of peroxide to 
upgrade the performance of chrome-free leather tanned with a biomass-derived 
aldehyde (BAT), the authors report that this suggests that the prepared DCH can 
manufacture BAT-tanned high-performance chrome-free leather (Ding et al. 2021b).
In Popiolski et al. (2022) Cr is removed from residual tanned leather by using 
microwave (MW) energy, achieving 99% extraction effciency after 12 min of treat￾ment at 60 °C; the MAE (microwave-assisted extraction) process enabled high Cr 
removal, complexing recycling, and reduced waste generation; an amino-terminated 
waterborne polyurethane-based polymeric dye (AWPUD) was synthesized for high￾performance chrome-tanned leather dyeing with a biomass-derived aldehyde (BAT) 
(Ding et al. 2021a). In Liu et al. (2021), a potential application of P(AA-AM-C_12 
DM) promotes dye absorption with a chromium-free eco-friendly organic tanning 
system, signifcantly promoting cleaner production in the leather industry.
In J. Wang et al. (2021), a Cr(III) adsorption protein (MerP) was shown on the 
cell surface of Escherichia coli and then combined with a system of magnetic gran￾ules to facilitate the adsorption of Cr(III); the removal of chromium(III) from the 
solid leather waste was carried out in two steps: the leaching step and the ion 
exchange step. The orthogonal method was applied to the leaching process with 
H2SO4 as the leaching agent, and the leaching rate was almost 100%. The adsorp￾tion and desorption of Cr3+ with 732# cation exchange resins in the ion exchange 
process were investigated (Wang et al. 2019).
An integrated technology comprising a novel salt-free and high-depletion chro￾mium tanning process by direct recycling of tanning wastewater was developed for 
highly effcient removal of Cr from post-tanning baths; the results indicated that, in 
the new technology, the utilization rate of total Cr reached 98.6% (conventional 
91.2%), the total discharge of chromium was reduced by 84.2% from the source, 
and the spent tanning liquor could be fully recycled for at least ten cycles, while the 
properties of the leather were not affected (Zhang et al. 2017). In de Aquim et al. 
(2019), the environmental impact of the water used by tanneries is minimized 
through the study of the possibilities of reusing wastewater from tanning baths.

10.3.4 Impact on the Circular Economy Model
The demands of the current context, in which efforts are closing toward the search 
for integral sustainability to guarantee healthy living conditions for current and 
future generations, direct the need to develop effcient and environmentally friendly 
production systems. Industries producing goods, such as the tanning plant analyzed 
in this study, must, from environmental responsibility, manage the waste they gener￾ate as part of their production process. It is necessary to redesign the production 
processes so that the wastewater from the tannery is treated and reused by the same 
or another industry of interest and/or is reincorporated into the environment without 
affecting the ecosystem.
Given this need, the Circular Economy (CE) model is presented as a contempo￾rary alternative that has been attracting the attention of researchers. The CE model 
allows the development of integrated systems with reverse recirculation, i.e., allows 
the revalorization of cogenerated waste as part of the production process and recy￾cling it to reuse it as inputs in the same production chain or in others in such a way 
that the economic life of the input is extended as much as possible.
Figure 10.2 presents a wastewater management system for the tanning industry, 
which integrates bioremediation techniques, and thus decontaminates the wastewa￾ter and reuses it in the tanning mill process or another industry and/or its reincorpo￾ration into the environment. The system under this approach aligns with the 
Fig. 10.2 Wastewater management system of the tanning industry with a comprehensive approach 
to bioremediation, from the CE model
10 Bioremediation of Wastewater from the Tanning Industry Under a Circular…178
overriding principle of the CE, recycling. With this approach, unwanted outputs of 
the leather production process, wastewater, are closed.
10.3.4.1 Environment
The environment benefts from a friendly and non-invasive model, allowing it to 
recover part of the resources used by the tanning industry to produce skins. 
Sustainability is a priority issue, where the concern is to regenerate and conserve 
environmental conditions that the human footprint has deteriorated. Then, the CE 
model allows us to pay for the achievement of sustainability.
10.3.4.2 Economic
Productive sectors such as the tanning industry or others, which revalue and reincor￾porate treated water into their production processes, will beneft from reincorporat￾ing recycled wastewater previously treated by bioremediation techniques. The reuse 
of recycled water will reduce the costs associated with the acquisition of water 
resources.
10.3.4.3 Social
Society benefts from developing wastewater treatment systems with a CE approach 
since the risk of acquiring or developing diseases associated with pollutant dis￾charges, which affect the population’s health and quality of life, is minimized.
10.4 Discussion
The development of humanity is inexorably linked to the state of the environment. 
Population growth and the satisfaction of the needs of humanity have led to an irra￾tional use of natural resources. It is the tannery industry that is responsible for envi￾ronmental degradation. Even though multiple strategies have been developed to 
address the management of wastewater generated by the tanning process, consider￾ing strategies for redesigning products and processes, they must be aligned inte￾grally with the EC approach so that removing toxic waste allows the reuse of treated 
industrial waters from bioremediation and, thus, pay to mitigate the damage to the 
environment, water, and health.
Bioremediation is presented in this study as a strategic ally with the ability to 
remedy the contaminated waters of the tannery. In this sense, it coincides with 
Houshyar et al. (2012) in that the bio-treatment processes are adequate due to the 
high level of organic content of the tannery wastewater. However, the effciency of 
N. Montalvo-Romero et al.179
such bio-treatments is affected by the high level of inorganic compounds, e.g., chro￾mium can affect the activity of microorganisms.
Despite this, bioremediation is a viable alternative to conventional techniques 
due to recent advances in removing heavy metals based on microorganisms. This is 
because microorganisms have evolved by developing detoxifcation mechanisms, as 
cited by Igiri et al. (2018). In addition, it coincides with Chaudhary et al. (2017), in 
which biological treatments are more favorable and cost-effective than other meth￾ods. In addition to being unproftable or ecological (Tripathi et al. 2021), they are 
generators of a large amount of sludge in the environment (Saxena and Bharagava 
2016). Since physicochemical strategies that are not ecologically focused employ 
many chemicals, as mentioned (Laxmi and Kaushik 2020). Therefore, it coincides 
with Juwarkar et al. (2010) in that bioremediation is a preferred alternative to con￾ventional methods. In addition, it coincides with Vijayaraj et al. (2018), where bio￾remediation improves water quality for safe discharge.
It is considered that the ecosystem’s restoration time could be minimized if 
microbial processes are intensifed with greater degradative capacities and a greater 
balance of nutrients, as well as proposed by Paliwal et al. (2012). Moreover, as part 
of the fndings of this study, it was identifed that bioremediation approaches could 
provide effcient results in less than 10 days, even after 5 hours of treatment.
Considering the above, bioremediation is the best and most environmentally 
friendly tool in the management of contaminated water; of all treatment technolo￾gies, a situation that is shared with Ashraf et al. (2018) and with Gupta et al. (2019); 
in addition to being economically viable, as mentioned by Vijayaraj et al. (2020).
Finally, it is an inexorable reality that regional human dynamics generate an 
imbalance in the environment. Rapid population growth, coupled with industrializa￾tion, brings with it a demand for urban spaces; In this sense, it is the water resource, 
an important factor that requires both the population and the industry for its devel￾opment. Therefore, remediation strategies with a CE approach are welcome to miti￾gate the adverse effects of the human footprint.
10.5 Conclusions
The chapter analyzes and discusses the mechanism of bioremediation as a biotech￾nological strategy that, aligned with the Circular Economy model, can contribute to 
managing the wastewater of the tanning industry, removing its toxic contaminants, 
and then the same tanning chain or another chain benefts from the treated water.
The fndings of this study indicate that the management of wastewater from the 
tanning industry, from bioremediation to sustainable biotechnology, is presented as 
a strategy with a signifcant benefcial impact. In the frst instance on (a) society, 
since the proper management of toxic wastewater emanating from the production of 
hides through bioremediation contributes to minimizing the diseases that are attrib￾uted to pollution by industrial waters―e.g., cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, polio￾myelitis―; in the second stay, it benefts the (b) environment, since the system of 
10 Bioremediation of Wastewater from the Tanning Industry Under a Circular…180
removal of pollutants from wastewater and the reuse of treated water within the 
value chain of the tanning industry or another industry with a Circular Economy 
approach, allowing the discharges of treated water to have the least possible nega￾tive impact on fora and fauna. In addition, this biotechnology benefts the (c) tan￾ning companies, which by adopting the wastewater management system, allow to 
make effcient the use-reuse of the water system within the value chain, at the same 
time that they pay to reduce the water footprint due to toxic water discharges, con￾tributing to an improvement of processes.
Bioremediation as biotechnology contributes to the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this sense, it 
contributes to contribute directly to the fulfllment of SDG 6 “Ensure the availability 
and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” by reducing pollution 
associated with the emission of toxic products in tannery wastewater while increas￾ing the reuse of said water resource and, SDG 12 “Ensure sustainable consumption 
and production patterns” as the proposed approach is a strategy that contributes to 
reducing the generation of wastes that are released into the atmosphere, water, and 
soil, thus minimizing their adverse effects on human health and the environment.
Finally, it is considered that bioremediation pays in managing toxic agents and 
polluting processes while mitigating the negative impact on water and health.

Abstract The harsh impacts of climate change, once considered a myth by the 
masses, have become a reality. Each year we are observing the problems of extreme 
weather and natural disasters, and among the most vulnerable countries lie the 
developing countries, like in the sub-continent region (including Bangladesh, India, 
Pakistan, and Yemen) or the African region (Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, 
and the Central African Republic). Despite the rapid growth of these regions eco￾nomically and in terms of population, the shortage of affordable and effective urban 
water and wastewater treatment remains a critical problem. It is mostly due to a lack 
of resources for proper treatment facilities, which leads to the spread of oral-fecal 
diseases. The nature-based systems have the market potential for water utilization 
and implementation in permitted water environments (irrigation systems), for the 
generation of bioenergy in closed loops (circular economy), resource recovery and 
ornamentation, and other benecial ecosystem services, e.g., pollinators attraction 
from plants. Further, they can be used for stormwater management, ood protection 
and risk management, implementation of blue-green infrastructures, urban water in 
food, water, and energy ecosystem, and urban water pollution control.

11.1 Introduction
In recent times, an increased trend of migration toward cities has been observed. 
This rapidly growing global urbanization was primally due to many reasons that 
include availability of jobs, good quality medical, sanitation, education facilities, 
well-connected roads, and access to civil and social security departments (Hájek 
et al. 2021). In short, it is not wrong to say that most of the global population wants 
to live on-grid facilities provided by the government. However, even today, half of 
the world’s population exists in rural and peri-urban regions (Capodaglio et  al. 
2017). A rural region is an open swath of land that has few homes or other buildings, 
and not very many people, while peri-urban regions are the settlements in proximity 
of large urban areas. One thing is common in both regions. It is this that they are 
usually without the services and facilities proper of such areas. Hence, they are off￾grid, and need off-grid solution to prevent any negative impact on the on-grid sys￾tems provided by the government or managed independently by private citizens. 
This problem in developing countries (like Pakistan, China, India, Nigeria, 
Cameroon, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and others) and least or underdevel￾oped countries (like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Gambia, Senegal, Yemen, 
Somalia, Benin, and others) further exacerbates due to the disparities between the

living standards of poor and rich, due to social and moral inequalities. A substantial 
portion of this population, or perhaps more than half of the earth’s population, still 
lacks access to adequate sanitary facilities or is striving to improve them while 
ramping up environmental protection and resource recovery (Velasco et al. 2022; 
Ahmed et al. 2023). Despite this, more than 1.7 billion people are living close to the 
river basins where water use exceeds recharge, while at least an estimated 1.8 bil￾lion people drink water that has been tainted by human waste coming from improper 
disposal and wastewater management without any pollution cleanup (Shamsudduha 
and Panda 2019). Clean and fresh water is a scarce natural resource, and the urgency 
of this issue is also highlighted in the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) (Capodaglio et al. 2017). SDG 6 is to ensure availability and sustain￾able management of water and sanitation for all or in short “Clean Water and 
Sanitation”. This SDG 6 aims to signifcantly increase recycling and safe reuse 
while reducing the quantity of untreated wastewater generated globally, by 2030 
(Chitonge et al. 2020). Access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for 
everyone is required by targets 6.3 and 6.4. However, in many developing countries, 
wastewater treatment is not a top priority when compared to the development of 
other types of infrastructure, such as electric and communication systems. 
Consequently, many towns (and even larger cities) in developing countries lack 
operational and effcient wastewater treatment facilities (Sadoff et al. 2020).
The present modern centralized collection and treatment system requires a lot of 
capital investment to setup and function, along with the cost of highly trained labor 
to handle it (Lopes et al. 2020). However, contrary to the construction of other infra￾structure types, such as power and communication infrastructures, modern central￾ized wastewater treatment is not typically given high priority in developing and least 
developed nations (Ahmed et al. 2023; Gallego-Schmid and Tarpani 2019). This 
does not seem to be a practical approach in countries other than those that are devel￾oped and can bear the installation and recurring direct and indirect costs of swift 
running of such faculties. As a result, there aren’t enough functional and effective 
wastewater treatment facilities in many small towns (and even bigger cities) in 
developing nations (Capodaglio et al. 2016).
Considering the economic and social situation in emerging and least developed 
nations, eco-innovation is essential for minimizing the environmental impact and 
improving the sustainability in terms of the economy, environment, and society 
(Gente and Pattanaro 2019). One option to counter this issue is to setup decentral￾ized wastewater management facilities utilizing nature-based systems (NbS). The 
NbS uses plants, soil, bacteria, fungi, algae, and other natural components and pro￾cesses to remove contaminants from wastewater, reducing the need for chemicals 
and increasing effciency (Capodaglio et  al. 2016). These techniques offer the 
potential to treat wastewater in a way that is environmentally friendly, affordable, 
sustainable, low-impact, and long-lasting (Lopes et al. 2020; Gallego-Schmid and 
Tarpani 2019).
11 Sustainable Decentralized Urban Water and Wastewater Treatment in Off-grid…188
11.2 What Is a Nature-based System, and How It Can 
Be Benefcial?
The NbS is not a new concept for the management of wastewater. For centuries, 
globally communities have unintentionally assisted in the development of wetland 
by directly discharging wastewater to surface water. It led to nutrient accumulation 
followed by the vegetation emergence (Capodaglio et al. 2016). These NbS have 
historically performed the role of buffering zone that reduces the contaminant loads 
to receiving waters (Greenwalt et al. 2018). With the advent of modern technologies 
and industrialization, the population dynamics have changed which also modifed 
the landscapes. The cities opted pollution control technologies (PCTs) to treat hefty 
amounts of wastewater (Capodaglio et  al. 2016; Gente and Pattanaro 2019). 
However, the adopted PCTs tend to be carried out as an “end of the pipe” solution. 
They use a mix of physical, chemical, and biological procedures and processes to 
remove particles, organic materials, and, where necessary, nutrients from wastewa￾ter to prevent the polluting of aquatic bodies downstream (Ahmed et al. 2021). A 
comparative beneft of NbS with modern PCTs for wastewater treatment is that both 
can improve water quality, however the other benefts of NbS are beyond this. The 
NbS supports social co-benefts such as leisure areas and recreational well-being 
through green spaces, enhanced urban microclimates, food and storm peak reduc￾tion, biomass generation, and water reuse. It also contributes to the maintenance and 
expansion of local and migrant biodiversity (Khan et al. 2021a). Further, they can 
be decentralized. These benefts are unachievable by any modern PCTs.
11.3 Decentralized NbS: The Treatment of Urban Water 
and Wastewater of Off-grid Settings
Urban water refers to all the water that occurs in the urban environment (including 
rainwater, portable water, domestic wastewater, stormwater, and others) (Capodaglio 
et  al. 2016). The composition and the amount of treatment needed in each case 
would be different like for rainwater and stormwater; a proper collection and then 
fooding of wetland areas grown on a perforation-based media requires no to limited 
pretreated, however the domestic wastewater (DW) composition varies signifcantly 
and hence there are a number of options that can be opted based on the pollution 
load (Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022). The examples of decentralized NbS are 
presented in the later section; however, frst it is important to know why the tradi￾tional PCTs aren’t a very good option in the context of developing countries, espe￾cially for off-grid settings.
In conventional modern PCTs, the DW discharge from different households is 
needed to be combined and channeled toward the centralized DW treatment facility, 
located far from the wastewater generation source (Kataki et al. 2021). The collec￾tion, channeling, streaming, and treatment required a lot of pumping and 
A. H. A. Khan et al.189
establishment of civil engineering works and installation (including piping for sew￾age collection and manhole junctions). Further, they must be operated at certain 
pressure and fow rate depending on the piping system. It can also induce wear and 
tear, requiring a periodic inspection and maintenance every 50–60 years (Libralato 
et al. 2012). On the other hand, using the decentralized systems the needs of such 
installation can be gradually met, as these off-grid systems respond well in residen￾tial, suburbs, countryside, commercial, and industrial area, where the population is 
scattered (Kataki et al. 2021; Capodaglio 2017). According to estimates, the decen￾tralized system can manage wastewater treatment with just around 20% of the exist￾ing drinking water demand, through the implementation of source control 
management and differential water utilization. These decentralized NbS (dNbS) can 
also be very effective in the metropolis large block redevelopment as the on-site 
treatment and wastewater reuse reduces the stress of extra wastewater discharge into 
the standing sewerage system, possibly preventing the sanitation services disruption 
during peak load times (Chen et al. 2021). The dNbS has the beneft of being fexi￾ble, small, and less obtrusive; nevertheless, other regional infuences (such as traffc, 
smells, and noise) must be weighed (Chen et al. 2021; Vymaza 2022).
Based on these arguments, wastewater management using dNbS in the commu￾nities in rural or peri-urban settings is ideal in relation to developing and least devel￾oped nations. The dNbS are more reasonable to deploy since the standard treatment 
infrastructure will add to the population’s already unsustainable long-term debt load 
in distant (low-income) regions and necessitate future upgrades when demand rises 
because of population growth. One noticeable development is the progressive loss 
of the idea of densely populated communities in cities all over the world widening 
to include the countryside (Hu et al. 2020). Thus, decentralization is much more 
prevalent in areas, where constructing a centralized effuent collecting infrastructure 
is not deemed to be fnancially sustainable.
11.4 Sustainability of Decentralized Nature-based Solution
As most of the off-grid communities in remote areas are clustered in small numbers, 
the decentralized wastewater management using NbS will be ideal. By the NbS 
treating comparatively small quantities of wastewater is possible, generated from 
such communities (located no less than 3–5  km away) (Libralato et  al. 2012; 
Capodaglio 2017). While it is true that a local collection infrastructure will still be 
required, it will be much cheaper and smaller than any of those required for stan￾dard, centralized treatment (Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022). Such system takes 
into account the local ecology, hydrology, and landscape factors (including eleva￾tion, precipitation rate, vegetation, and soil composition) (Afzal et al. 2019; Khan 
et al. 2020). The dNbS-based hygiene and sanitation is also sustainable as it pro￾motes the 7-R concept, i.e., Refuse, Recycle, Reuse, Reduce, Repurpose, Recover, 
and Rot for the natural resources (Çimen 2023). With dNbS, the unnecessary instal￾lation of civil work, need of energy, and use of chemicals for centralized treatment 
11 Sustainable Decentralized Urban Water and Wastewater Treatment in Off-grid…190
are either refused or reduced. The wastewater (treated or non-treated) is dumped in 
the ocean, reused, and recycled locally in irrigation of constructed wetlands. The 
dNbS site serves as a place harboring biodiversity, hence brownfeld can be repur￾posed recreationally. Further, with dNbS it is also possible to recover bioenergy 
(through the transformation of organic materials) and rotting of organic composta￾ble residues containing macro and micronutrients to release nutrients naturally. 
Hence, the dNbS aids effcient resource utilization and the close loop development 
consistent with the concept of circular economy.
One of the SDGs is health goal (SDG 3) which says, “ensure healthy lives and 
promote well-being for all at all ages”. The dNbS safeguard toward prevention of 
diseases and promotion of health (by assuring a clean management of wastewater 
upstream of water bodies and restraining the disease spread downstream the water￾body) and maintain a healthy balance of water quality and ecosystem (through the 
prevention of excessive pollutants discharge) (van den Bosch and Sang 2017). As 
discussed earlier, even the dNbS needs collection and transportation of wastewater 
to the adopted NbS. Section 11.4.1 discusses the details related to the collection and 
transportation of wastewater for an adopted dNbS. These adopted NbS can be either 
individually or combination constructed wetland (CW), membrane biological reac￾tors (MBR), and anaerobic reactors (AR). Section 11.4.2 contains details related to 
applicability and design of the dNbS design.
11.4.1 Sustainable Collection and Transportation 
of Wastewater
The traditional wastewater collection system is known to induce a negative impact 
on the environment and economy at local and global scales (Pasciucco et al. 2022). 
Building the centralized sewage collection infrastructure itself generates a huge 
environmental impact during excavation, installation, and operation (Libralato et al. 
2012). Hence, it is very important to consider the development and maintenance of 
sewage systems when the comparison is made between centralized and decentral￾ized wastewater system solutions. Conventional wastewater management relies 
heavily on high water usage and waste dilution, which is surely a big issue increas￾ing the burden of additional treatment cost (Capodaglio 2020). The collection sys￾tem requires a signifcant amount of tap water just to fush the system and transport 
the primary waste.
This problem can be managed using source control and differentiation of waste￾water, and then transportation to the dNbS as they require less amount of water for 
proper functioning (50–60% less than the current water demand for conventional 
wastewater treatment systems) (Oral et al. 2020). It results in less use of wastage of 
drinking quality water. Further, the operation of conventional systems is highly 
dependent on uninterrupted power supply for pumping and operation activity, which 
makes the application of these systems vulnerable and non-resilient, during events 
A. H. A. Khan et al.191
and power failures (Kataki et al. 2021; Libralato et al. 2012). This is not a hidden 
fact that in developing and least developed nation, the economic conditions and 
unavailability of surplus money to import oil have been severe issues in the manage￾ment and supply of electricity (Khan et al. 2019; Qurban et al. 2021).
A few prime examples of such conditions that were very well-known included 
the Sri Lankan economic crisis in 2022, reputative economic bailout packages of 
Pakistan, national-level electricity grid failure in October 2022 affecting up to 80% 
in Bangladesh, lack of electricity access for more than half of Nigeria, War torn 
conditions of Yemen, Ukraine, or Syria, social and civil equality in and against 
nations like Somalia, Palestine, and Colombia (Murshed et al. 2020; Ahmed and 
Abbas 2023; Jayasinghe 2023). Additionally, even assuming that there is a well￾designed centralized wastewater collection system for both wastewater and storm 
runoff, combined sewage systems are nevertheless typically employed in the actual 
world (especially in urban areas) (Capodaglio 2017).
11.4.1.1 Economical and Sustainable Practices for Domestic 
Wastewater Collection
A well-known fact is that solid waste can be managed well if it is segregated into at 
source. It is due to this reason in most of the developed nation the solid waste is 
segregated into organic, inorganic, recyclables, and hazardous wastes (Cheah et al. 
2022). It implies to the same to the wastewater. The domestic wastewater is usually 
collected as a homogenous sanitary sewage. Different kinds of effuents can be seg￾regated, which can help with on-site or off-site processing for resource recovery and 
recycling (Liu et al. 2022). Although this idea is widely accepted and discussed for 
the sustainable management of the carbon, nutrient, energy, and water cycles, there 
is still a lot of opposition to its widespread implementation (Capodaglio 2017). 
Notable reason is that the reintroduction of NbS in already well-working wastewa￾ter management facilities will be highly diffcult due to unavailability of space, or 
just general resistance to change or ill education/awareness at the governmental 
policy and planning level.
The source separation will help prevent waste dilution and unnecessary cost￾related burden. The reason behind this is that this will ultimately lower the energy 
demand for the collection and treatment, further the nutrients recovery is more eff￾cient in concentrated form, making black water an ideal stream of wastewater for 
recovery. Report suggested that even precious metals like gold can be recovered 
from concentrated biosolid sludge obtained from sewage sludge (AlKetbi et  al. 
2018). Another advantage of source segregation and collection of concentrated 
wastewaters is that the human pathogens, micropollutants, pharmaceuticals, and 
cosmetic products are mostly contained in blackwater, therefore much more feasi￾ble to a biohazardous waste stream, with limited to no external contamination 
(Cheah et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2022). Source separation also allows for maintaining 
the treatment ratio (anaerobic to aerobic, generation of bioenergy). With source 
separation, as the volume to be treated is already reduced, there will be less primary 
11 Sustainable Decentralized Urban Water and Wastewater Treatment in Off-grid…192
Fig. 11.1 Comparison between conventional treatment and source separation followed by NbS￾based treatment. (Source Separation and Segregation of Wastewater Streams)
input needed with minimal sludge generation (Shen et al. 2020). In general, domes￾tic wastewater can be segregated into blackwater (collectively wastewater from toi￾let and kitchen), and less concentrated gray water from various washing activities 
(Fig. 11.1). The black water from toilet can be further segregated as yellow water 
(urine) and brown water (feces). However, in the case of developing countries, the 
segregation of black water is not practical as usually the houses are not constructed 
with separate urinals. However, the bath water can be segregated easily with little 
modifcation in the plumbing works. In most cases concentrated black water is 
treated using ARs or AR + CW (Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022; Kataki et al. 
2021). In Muslim countries, the ablution water from mosques can also be separated, 
as it is generated plainly by body cleansing, without any added impurities, and 
hence can easily be managed in constructed wetlands without any pre-treatment 
(Fuchs et al. 2020).
Similarly, the gray water contains relatively low levels of pathogen in compari￾son to the effuent of the standard wastewater treatment plant. It can also be used as 
an alternate water source with minimal treatment; however, if the concentration of 
nutrients, personal care products (detergent, soap, and oil), house dust, kitchen 
waste (grease and fats), or organic and inorganic contaminants are in higher levels, 
a minor onsite processing can make it recycled. The energy and cost saving due to 
source separation and segregation is a well-demonstrated face. With the introduc￾tion of source separation only for yellow water in a centralized sanitation system, 
the energy demand per year is reduced by ~25%, while the separation of black 
water, kitchen refuse, and gray water can lead up to 32% reduction in the primary 
energy consumption (Tervahauta et al. 2014).
A. H. A. Khan et al.193
11.4.1.2 Pre-treatment of Wastewater
The streams of wastewater, even after segregation, have numerous contaminants. 
These can cause the upset of the processing system by grease-induced clogging or 
generate foul odors. A simple pre-treatment, like stagnation – reducing the fow rate 
of wastewater, can signifcantly help in the removal of suspended solids and skim 
off the grease. In the context of off-grid areas, a common basic septic tank is a 
simple and appropriate option for managing the initial gray water pretreatment 
(Capodaglio 2017). Then, sophisticated oxidation, coagulation, extensive or intense 
biological systems, and membrane or sand fltration can all be used. The biological 
oxygen demand (BOD) can be reduced greater than 90% by utilizing the pretreat￾ment, and the treated recycled water can be used for charging the aquifer, ornamen￾tal gardening and landscaping, or toilet fushing (He et al. 2022).
Another treatment that can be used to lower the levels of gray water generation 
is to improve water usage effciently which can be achieved by adopting low-fush 
devices particularly made to decrease the amount of water used for low-fow lavato￾ries and sewage solids mobilization (from 6–12 L fush−1
 down to 0.8–2 L fush−1
) 
(Kim et al. 2022). Through this, the biological and chemical oxygen demand can be 
increased signifcantly. Due to the possibility of human biohazard, the recycled 
wastewater should not be used for the irrigation of the edible crops, without con￾frming the absence of any bio-hazardous microorganism in the treated wastewater.
11.4.2 Sustainable Design for dNbS
Despite the popularity of conventional wastewater treatment systems in the off-grid 
areas of developing countries situations, including traditional septic tanks, Imhoff 
tanks, lagoon systems, and small activated sludge (AS)-based plants, various pro￾cess technologies are being devised with decentralized systems in mind (Libralato 
et al. 2012; Fuchs et al. 2020). In recent years the focus on using the natural sys￾tems’ ecological service was investigated, in great depth. A few natural-based sys￾tems including the use of constructed wetlands, membrane biological reactors, and 
anaerobic reactors have shown promising results for application (Fernández del 
Castillo et al. 2022).
It is not based on the proposal or expostulation, these NbS have proven robust 
and sturdy for the application in wastewater treatment, at both domestic and indus￾trial scales (Vymaza 2022). However, in this chapter, the discussion will solely be 
focused on the use of these NbS for urban wastewater management. As discussed 
earlier the successful execution of these systems, they are highly dependent on some 
parameters, the dNbS would be infuenced by the location’s climate, wastewater 
composition, land area needed for the treatment, geography, and local recycle/reuse 
requirements (Khan et al. 2016, 2021b; Iqbal et al. 2020; Raza et al. 2019). In gen￾eral, to make a dNbS stand out from the conventional wastewater treatment system, 
the natural technology should demonstrate specifc treatment effciency under 
11 Sustainable Decentralized Urban Water and Wastewater Treatment in Off-grid…194
provided local conditions, less laborious with minimal operational and maintenance 
needs, sustainable, capable of expanding, and economical.
11.4.2.1 Constructed Wetland
Among the most proposed alternate treatment systems, the constructed wetlands 
(CWs) receive also attention around the world as candidate decentralized systems 
(Silveira et al. 2020). These are the manmade natural systems that were well suited 
for managing the remediation of municipal, rural, and industrial effuent due to 
design diversity and functional capacity.
In the simplest manner they can be a pond (containing algae, fungi, and bacteria) 
for the removal of contaminates, while in more advance system they are built utiliz￾ing plant and substrate capable to facilitate water fltration, percolations, and clean￾ing (Kataki et  al. 2021). The different basic designs and setup in which the 
constructed wetland can operate are presented in Fig. 11.2. The designs in which a 
constructed wetland operates are generally categorized as free water surface fow 
and subsurface fow systems. Additionally, subsurface-fow constructed wetland 
(SSF-CW) can either be characterized as free water fow (FW-CW), horizontal fow 
(HF-CW), vertical fow (VF-CW), or a hybrid (multi-stage) system (H-CW) 
(Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022).
The choice of CW system to be adopted highly depends on the type of wastewa￾ter treatment needed. For instance, free-water surface constructed wetlands (FWS￾CWs) are ideal for the partial treatment or for the polishing of the treated wastewater, 
for the management of stormwater, and agricultural runoff management can cause 
lake pollution (Parihar et al. 2022). FWS-CWs can be characterized by the macro￾phyte (foating, submerged, or emergent) used in the system. The FWS-CW are 
more suitable for warmer climates. A typical FWS CW consists of a shallow basin 
constructed of soil or other media to support the roots of vegetation (when rooting 
macrophytes are used) and a water control structure that maintains a shallow depth 
of water (Fig. 11.2a). The most common type of SSF-CW is HF-CW; in these sys￾tems, water travels horizontally from the entry to the exit, typically through anaero￾bic and anoxic microenvironments. The roots of the macrophyte provide the aerobic 
condition due to which the soil only near the root is oxygenated.
In the anoxic and anaerobic zone, denitrifcation occurs, while nitrifcation is 
limited due to low oxygenation (Gorgoglione and Torretta 2018). As wastewater 
trickles through soil/fltering media the suspended particles in wastewater are 
removed, hence the effciency is higher. The fltering media also tends to remove 
phosphorus removal by sorption (Shen et al. 2020).
Due to the intermittent pumping, the VF-CW requires comparatively more com￾plicated operation and maintenance than the HF-CW.  The VF-CW are typically 
designed to enhance the system’s capacity to absorb air oxygen, permitting it to 
effectively carry out nitrifcation (Kataki et al. 2021). The VF-CW are highly effec￾tive for the degradation of organic matter and suspended and dissolved solids 
removal. In a hybrid-constructed wetland, two or more single-stage CW setups are

combined to effciently remove N and other contaminants in wastewater by foster￾ing both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Vymaza 2022). Commonly a VF-CW 
linked with an HF-CW confguration is used in H-CW. These systems induce the 
nitrifcation of NH4 in the VF-CW, due to aerobic conditions, and the subsequent 
raise of denitrifcation in the HF-CW, which results in complete N. Overall, when 
compared with single-stage CW, the H-CW shows a superior removal rate for all the 
parameters (Gorgoglione and Torretta 2018). The percentage removal effcacies 
range of different CWs based on the published literature are presented in Table 11.1
(Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022).

11.4.2.2 Membrane Biological Reactors
The MBR system effectively removes organic and inorganic contaminants from 
home and/or industrial wastewaters by combining biological degradation of waste￾water pollutants with membrane fltration (Capodaglio 2017). It has emerged as a 
reliable, more portable substitute for conventional bioreactors. The fltration layers 
(1 μm pore size each) eliminate the requirement for wastewater gravitational clear￾ance that was a key treatment bottleneck causing aerobic wastewater treatment sys￾tem failures (Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022; Fuchs et al. 2020). The membrane 
fltration in the MBRs enables higher biomass retention, which therefore reduces 
the amount of continuous aeration required for the growth of useful biodegraders, 
and decreases the space requirement, compared to settling and sedimentation tanks. 
However, periodic backwashing is needed to prevent the choking of the membrane 
used for fltration (Rahul Krishna et al. 2022). These membranes can be fat sheets 
and hollow tubes of fber, ceramics, or fabric. In general, MBR systems used to treat 
domestic wastewater would result in an effuent that had non-detectable total sus￾pended solids (TSS), BOD <2 mg L−1
, NH4-N < 0.5 mg L−1
, fecal coliform count 
<0.20 CFU mL−1
, and total N < 5 mg L−1
 (Capodaglio 2017). With specifc energy 
requirements of 2.3–1.7 kWh m−3
 of treated wastewater, respectively, the applica￾tion to segregated residential wastewaters from housing neighborhoods demon￾strated removal effciencies ≥95% COD, 94% TSS, 89% TN, and 100% coliforms 
for black and gray water treatment (Capodaglio et al. 2017).
11.4.3 Anaerobic Reactors
Anaerobic treatment reactors are relatively less energy requiring compared to the 
MBRs, as they perform degradation of organic matter through anaerobic bacteria 
(Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022). Through the process of hydrolysis, acidogene￾sis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis, in ARs most common end product is meth￾ane which can be used as a biogas (Tervahauta et al. 2014). Further as anaerobic 
bacterial kinetic is much slower than aerobic, the ARs produce lesser amount of 
A. H. A. Khan et al.197
sludge, hence the indirect cost of sludge management is also eliminated. The ARs 
can be categorized into up-fow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASBs), anaero￾bic baffed reactors (ABRs), and anaerobic flters (AFs) based on the treatment 
mechanism (Fig. 11.3) (Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022; Tervahauta et al. 2014).
The UASB is the most common form of AR used for the treatment of industrial 
and municipal wastewater, and is considered the simplest, fexible, and cheaper 
compared to other ARs (He et al. 2022). However, the removal of P and N using the 
UASB is relatively uncommon. Further in UASB the formation of NH4 is reported, 
which results in the toxicity to methanogens. Although UASB use at temperatures 
below 10 °C is still feasible, it has been discovered that low hydrolysis rates lead to 
a decline in the anaerobic reactor’s overall performance (Fernández del Castillo 
et al. 2022; Pasciucco et al. 2022). However, to successfully apply UASB of sewage 
wastewater treatment under such circumstances, incoming biodegradable solids in 
the wastewater streams must be removed. It is done to promote methanogenesis in 
the reactor (Capodaglio 2017). Soluble COD can still be effciently converted to 
methane at temperatures as low as 5 °C.
The ABRs are the set of sequential UASBs that have an added advantage of mini￾mal sludge clogging. The degradation of organic matter in ABRs occurs in 2 phases, 
with phase 1 contributing to hydrolysis and acetogenesis, while phase 2 is linked 
with acetogenesis and methanogenesis (de Oliveira Paranhos et  al. 2022). The 
phases occur separately as baffes divide the reactor volume into different chambers. 
The ABRs are known for higher pollutant removal, was due to the retention of active 
biomass in each chamber. Further, the ABRs are known to operate at elevated pH 
and elevated levels of pollutants like ammonia, dye, and phenol (Capodaglio et al. 
2017). A demerit for ABRs is the formation of death zones in the reactor that 
obstructs the swift working and circulation of wastewater in the system. The AFs 
are fxed bed anaerobic treatment systems that can be sub-classifed based on the 
fow direction, i.e., up-fow and down-fow anaerobic flters (Fernández del Castillo 
et al. 2022). The AFs are resilient to the variability of wastewater volume, and toler￾ant to high fuctuation in pH and NH4 levels, compared to other ARs.
However, the periodic operational maintenance (removal of dead sludge) can 
result in a loss in microbial bioflm activity, which needs recovery time to regain 
working effciency (Capodaglio 2017). The percentage removal effcacies range of 
different ARs based on the published literature are presented in Table  11.2
(Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022).
11.5 Off-grid Wastewater Treatment in Developing 
and Least Developed Countries: A Pragmatic Approach
As discussed in the earlier sections installation, operation, and maintenance cost is 
the prime factor in deciding the choice of the treatment system in developing coun￾tries (Hu et al. 2020; Fuchs et al. 2020). The issues related to the commonly used

a

decentralized treatment systems are presented in Table 11.3. Hence the pragmatic 
approach is to adopt a technology that is natural and biologically driven, with mini￾mal need or dependence on electricity (Gallego-Schmid and Tarpani 2019). Though 
in some case, the need of energy for the pumping and collection of wastewaters 
cannot be fully eliminated, however for off-grid conditions solar and wind energy 
systems can be used, making the process of wastewater collection more initial, yet 
it need an initial capital investment. Similarly, a gravity-based passive wastewater 
collection system using a free-fow constructed wetland system can be constructed, 
thereby reducing the electricity dependence for sewer collection close to zero 
(Capodaglio et al. 2017).
For the treatment of urban wastewater, an excellent comparison of different bio￾logical, conventional, and combined treatment technologies was performed 
(Fernández del Castillo et al. 2022; Libralato et al. 2012). It was established that 
combining ARs with CWs can result in a treatment system that is effcient, effca￾cious, and fnancially viable, particularly for developing nations with minimal infra￾structure and resources. As the constructional complexity and raw material need for 
the conventional centralized treatment system is extremely high, the design of a 
treatment system should be low-energy and raw material dependent (Lopes et al. 
2020). Further care should also be taken in managing the end product during each 
phase of treatment to make the treatment system sustainable. There are many differ￾ent combinations possible for the combination of ARs with CW, however some 
combinations and designs are presented in Fig. 11.4.
The removal of solids, organic debris, and nutrients is done very well by com￾bined AR + CW systems, which may effectively assure health and cleanliness. With 
AR (USAB and ABR) + CW (HF-CW, VF-CW, and H-CW), generally higher levels 
of organic and suspended particles can be removed, however for the removal of 
nutrients (N and P) the ARs are not well suited (Rahul Krishna et al. 2022). With 
appropriate selection of combining CW, hydraulic retention time, choice of macro￾phytes, and activity area the level of nutrients (N and P) can also be reduced consid￾erably (Capodaglio et al. 2017; Khan et al. 2017). Because of the very low oxygen 
content in AR, nitrifcation, ammonifcation, and phosphate release are mostly 
encouraged (Shen et al. 2020). Subsequent aerobic units may also have accumula￾tion of phosphate in bacteria. This aerobic condition can be provided by the CW, 
notably VF-CW. Eventually, denitrifcation can be induced in HF-CW, due to the

combined systems for the removal of emerging pollutants should be evaluated, as it 
can affect environmental health, due to ecotoxicity.
These emerging pollutants included antibiotics, polyfuorinated aromatic sub￾stances, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and microplastic (Fernández del Castillo et al. 
2022; Capodaglio 2017). The seasonal and periodic variability of wastewater 
parameters should also be monitored, for risk and failure prevention. The most nota￾ble environmental impact of a combined AR + CW system can arise during the 
construction phase, due to the usage of raw resources (such as concrete, reinforcing 
steel, HDPE coatings, and gravel) and changes in land use (Fernández del Castillo 
et al. 2022; Lutterbeck et al. 2017). Due to the AR + CW systems’ effectiveness in 
removing pollutants from raw wastewater, any possible effects on eutrophication 
and ecotoxicity in fresh and marine environments during operation are very mini￾mal (Rahul Krishna et al. 2022; Lutterbeck et al. 2017).
Additionally, the electricity consumption of AR + CW (0.18 kWh m−3
) during 
operation is below the average for non-intensive treatments (0.30 kWh m−3
), result￾ing in low environmental impacts in the categories of abiotic resource depletion, 
eutrophication, and human and terrestrial toxicity (Fernández del Castillo et  al. 
2022). Care should be taken for the management of greenhouse gases (GHGs), 
including methane, dinitrogen monoxide, as these gases are released during the 
operational phase of combined AR + CW, notably during the anaerobic phase of 
treatment (Dell’Osbel et al. 2020). For the prevention of this release a small-scale 
biogas recovery methods can be adopted. One such methods is to add the solid food 
waste into an anaerobic digestor (receiving concentrated sludge and brown water) to 
increase biogas production.
As the CW and AR natural biological systems, the energy input for the operation 
of such system is minimal (∼0 kWh m−3
), compared to the modern biological sys￾tems for wastewater treatment including MBR and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic system 
(~0.66–4.24 and 0.31 kWh m−3
, respectively) (Su et al. 2019). The establishment 
11 Sustainable Decentralized Urban Water and Wastewater Treatment in Off-grid…202
and installation of AR + CW systems require larger spaces, In general, land need per 
inhabitant for AR + CW is ~1.3 m2
 Inhabitant−1
, in which 1.2 is for CW and 0.05–0.1 
for AR. Hence, regions with available adorable land are ideal. Further, this land 
demand is much lower than the other biological methods like MBR (~2.5  m2
Inhabitant−1
) and stabilization ponds (~0.3–13.3  m2
 Inhabitant−1
) (Ingrao et  al. 
2020). The combined system of AR + CW has to multifunctional potential of green 
infrastructure. The CW component can be located on the street side and pedestrian 
circulation, providing the habitat for wildlife and valuable resources, and can also 
work as stormwater storage and polishing treatment (Fernández del Castillo et al. 
2022; Shen et al. 2020). Additionally, using ornamental plants in the CW, the com￾bined systems generate revenue. As the system mimics an ecosystem, non-tangible 
socioeconomic benefts of combined systems outweigh its acceptability over other 
urban wastewater treatment systems (Khan et al. 2021a).
11.6 Conclusions
The use of the nature-based solution as a decentralized wastewater system is ideal 
for the small-scale cluster communities of rural and peri-urban areas. Though such 
systems are effcacious everywhere in the world, in the context of developing and 
least developed countries, such technologies are the most practical to be imple￾mented. The use of combined alternate technology like AR + CW, among the other 
combinations of dNbS is the most economical and robust; however, the choice of 
dNbS wastewater system adopted is subjective to each community and country. The 
most important issue should be the availability of land that can be dedicated to the 
dNbS, and the climatic condition. The dNbS like combined AR + CW can perform 
exceptionally well in warmer climates, however in colder conditions the systems are 
relatively diffcult to operate. Unfortunately, in the present world due to climate 
change developing and least developed countries are highly vulnerable to climatic 
catastrophes. Based on the developmental priorities of developing and least devel￾oped countries the dNbS are an ideal candidate for the treatment of wastewater, 
especially in off-grid settings. With these natural systems the spread of gastric dis￾eases can be minimized, which is among the leading cause of death in poor regions 
of the world. The dNbS can help in the reduction of GHG emissions, has lower 
carbon footprint, demands limited technical requirements, and is affordable com￾pared to other wastewater treatment methods. The decentralized NbS for wastewa￾ter treatment has already become a well-established technology in many parts of the 
world, with relevant material and technical expertise present in the developing and 
least developed nations; however, technological transfer into practice is still insuf￾fcient, and low awareness and recognition of the domestic wastewater treat￾ment benefts and a “business as usual” mentality persists at the policy and planning 
levels by public offces and government.

Geothermal Wastewater Management 
to Create a Circular Economy: Taking 
Advantage of the Abundant Thermal 
Wastewater in Iceland
Samaneh Sadat Nickayin
Abstract Iceland is a geologically active land and home to some of the world’s 
most active volcanoes and the largest glaciers in Europe. In this northern sea island, 
water is the most inuential element in the economy and planning strategy of island￾ers’ everyday life. Water comes in all forms, both as a provider and a threat. Water 
is a crucial element for Icelandic industry development, which is one of the pioneers 
in hydropower and geothermal energy production. This commentary is a synthesis 
of different Icelandic case studies to manage geothermal wastewater in a circular 
economy to reduce the environmental impact of such wastewater.

12.1 Introduction
As shing is the economy’s primary source in Iceland, most urban settlements were 
built around the rich shing resources along the coastline. Dwelling with water is 
the origin of Icelandic urbanity, which relies on naval resources and waterworks.
The urbanisation development initiated a new chapter of energy production in 
Iceland, which was mainly focused on abundant water. During the past century, 
Icelanders imported coal, kerosene and the traditional national peat for heating and 
cooking. The burgeoning of urbanisation has led to the construction of new energy 
implants, using natural and abundant geothermal heat and hydropower sources for 
heating and electricity generation.

The frst Icelandic hydropower station started operating in Hafnarfjörður, near 
the capital area, in 1904. Reykjavík in 1921 and Akureyri in northern Iceland got 
electricity from hydropower stations in the early 1920s.
For centuries, Icelanders used natural geothermal springs for bathing and wash￾ing, but in the frst years of the twentieth century, hot water began to be harnessed 
for individual heating homes, which today is considered the most successful story 
of the geothermal community.
Due to the abundance of hydropower and Geothermal energy production, local 
authorities focused on the central engine of industry in energy production, provid￾ing incentives for different multinational companies with high electricity demands 
to be based in Iceland. For instance, metal manufactories are the most crucial power￾intensive industry in Iceland, consuming almost 50% of total electricity production; 
fshing and agriculture are the other two prominent sectors of energy consumption 
in Iceland (IEA, 2012).
This chapter focuses on geothermal energy extractions and how wastewater 
reuse created a circular economic model within the industry and domestic use.
The extraction of geothermal energy requires hot water reservoirs. The central 
geothermal energy plants in Iceland are located in hot areas of Hveragerði, 
Grindavík, Þingvellir, Reykjahlíð and Húsavík with a total capacity of 802.5 MW 
(Mikhaylov, 2020). By drilling a well through the ground, the geothermal fuid, 
consisting of a combination of water, vapour and minerals, is extracted and fed to 
the geothermal power plant to power a turbine to generate low-cost electricity. The 
temperature of the extracted fuid could vary between 400 and 60 °C. The power￾plant wastewater can be injected back into the well or discharged into nature. The 
former solution is costly but can be feasible for large and long-life wells. The latter 
is harmful to the environment as it contains salt and minerals. To mitigate such a 
damage, it is possible to treat the water via a three-phase distillation process to sepa￾rate the salts and minerals from the water to obtain clean water.
Most studies focused on desalination and chemical stress assessment of geother￾mal wastewater. However, in past years, different innovative approaches found the 
potential of reusing geothermal wastewater to create a new circular economy model. 
The following circular strategies aim for holistic societal resiliency in the face of 
global climate change. The circular solutions proposed emphasise food security, 
leisure activities and waste management to minimise the detrimental impacts of 
geothermal wastewater and provide a venue for innovation and collaboration for a 
resilient community.
12.2 The Industrial Site and Leisure Activities
12.2.1 Blue Lagoon and Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach
Geothermal is not only a source of energy production but also a heat source in 
swimming pools, creating the beating heart of urban social life in all Icelandic 
towns. Being an island, swimming has been considered a survival skill in Icelandic 
S. S. Nickayin209
culture, and during the 19th Iceland became one of the frst countries to pass 
Legislation enabling municipalities to introduce swimming as an obligatory part of 
its school curriculum; each student should at least complete 20  h of swimming 
every year (Lög 25, 1940; Lög 39, 1925). The reasons for such a choice are due to 
the security issues of islanders (as fshing is the core of society), Icelandic cultural 
heritage, and the promotion of public health (Bogadóttir, 2021). Such urban bathing 
culture attracts millions of visitors annually to enjoy Iceland’s ‘wellness industry 
and spa culture’. The design of swimming pools and hot tubs must guarantee the 
site’s energy effciency. The Blue Lagoon and Sky Lagoon are the two most promi￾nent design prototypes for wellness industry spas.
The Blue Lagoon results from an accidental by-product of the Svartsengi geo￾thermal plant power opening in 1976. As water cannot be recycled because of its 
high concentration of minerals, the surplus of wastewater from geothermal plants 
has been led into the lava feld. The high silica concentration created soft white mud 
at the bottom of the lagoon. The Blue Lagoon has grown incredibly over the last 40 
years, and in 2012, National Geographic published a list of Wonders of the World,1
including the Blue Lagoon in the Water category and shared this recognition with 
the esteemed company. The title of “Wonders of the World” outlines the crucial role 
of “Calibrated and perceptive architectural, wellness, and hospitality 
design” (Bogadóttir, 2021) that demonstrates the potential of geothermal wastewa￾ter as a recreational open space that emancipates through global promotion, yield￾ing twenty-two millions of profts even during COVID-19. Besides the swimming 
pool, the Blue Lagoon company produces a wide range of natural skincare cosmetic 
products using the ground sea, silica, minerals and algae. The Blue Lagoon is a 
demonstration of an astute circular economy that eliminates wastewater and pollu￾tion, circulating products and materials, and the regeneration of nature, which have 
been at the centre of the business model development (Fig. 12.1).
The artifcial Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach of downtown Reykjavik is another 
example of geothermal engineering technology with the idea of elevating the tempera￾ture of a small part of the North Atlantic Ocean with discharge wastewater from the 
Reykjavik district heating system so that the temperature of the lagoon can become as 
high as 18–20 °C in the summertime (Snaeland and Sigurbjornsdóttir, 2010). The 
combination of warm ocean water and the glistening golden Moroccan sand allows a 
bizarre sensation of being in the middle of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans and 
indulging in some summertime frolicking. Thanks to the best Icelandic geothermal 
complexity engineering, the bay of Nauthólsvík has a Blue Flag certifcate – an award 
conferred to environmentally sustainable beaches with high eco-friendly standards.
1The offcial word of National Geographic Wonders of the World 2012, to describe the wonder for 
the water of Blue Lagoon is: “Iceland straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the North American 
and Eurasian tectonic plates are pulling apart. Upwelling magma built the island and heats its vast 
reservoirs of water, creating a geothermal paradise. First among the country’s many simmering 
geothermal pools is the Blue Lagoon, a turquoise vision in a black basaltic moonscape. The geo￾thermal spa is fed by seawater 6500 feet (1981 m) beneath the surface, where it reaches a searing 
464 °F (240 °C). Capturing silica and other minerals on its way to the surface, it emerges from the 
ground at a balmy 100 °F (38 °C), just right for pampering visitors”.

The use of geothermal resources for bathing and swimming, recreation, relax￾ation, socialising, and therapeutic treatment has deep roots in different cultures 
around the world, a tradition that undoubtedly remained much the same through the 
centuries in all corners of the globe. However, modern technology has made it pos￾sible in a better condition, where “resource recovery” (Allenby, 2006) and “industry 
ecology” (Iacovidou et. al, 2017) are blended to create great potential in the “well￾ness and leisure industry” (Fig. 12.2).

12.3 Greenhouses and Outdoor Agriculture
12.3.1 Friðheimar and ALDIN Biodome
The usage of geothermal wastewater is not limited to the outdoor public swimming 
pool and spa design; it is essential for local food security and production in Iceland. 
Iceland relies on other countries for half of its food supply and necessary inputs for 
food production. If food imports were discontinued, Iceland would be unable to 
feed its population. The history of Iceland’s shift from self-suffciency to import 
reliance reveals that the domestic agricultural sector weakened signifcantly, and the 
country’s carbon footprint increased tremendously. Given Iceland’s sparse arable 
land and harsh climate, greenhouses provide more variety, longer growing seasons, 
and a greater yield of crops that could be achieved in the traditional 
method  (Garðarsdóttir et  al., 2021). One of Iceland’s oldest and most important 
usages of geothermal wastewater is heating greenhouses. The total geothermal 
energy used in Iceland’s greenhouse sector is estimated to be 740 TJ annually 
(Ragnarsson, 2003). Modern greenhouse technology makes it possible to grow 
almost everything in Iceland, from lettuce and peppers to bananas, melon and grape￾vines, though some plants require more intense care or costly treatment and harvest￾ing. The idea of a sustainable, authentic food experience, eating bananas grown in 
Iceland or enjoying a cup of Icelandic coffee directly from the tree in a greenhouse￾café is sure to be competitive amongst a growing number of tourists and people 
12 Geothermal Wastewater Management to Create a Circular Economy: Taking…212

willing to pay for the quality and the consciousness of where the food comes 
from (Garðarsdóttir et al., 2021; Helgadóttir, 2017) (Fig. 12.3).
Today, greenhouses are part of the “indoor” public space realm; for instance, 
Friðheimar Greenhouse is a restaurant where geothermal heating technology makes 
indoor horticulture possible. Friðheimar is a gratifying restaurant that demonstrates 
the art of “placemaking” where the hidden, hot water pipelines fourish the fragrant 
tomato plants, creating an inspiring example of “circular Agriculture” (Ministerie 
van Algemene Zaken, 2017)” where the users can enjoy the feast of tomato soup 
with freshly baked bread (Fig. 12.4).
Geothermal steam is commonly used to boil and disinfect the soil in greenhouses. 
However, geothermal wastewater has been used in several locations to thaw the soil, 
enabling the vegetables to grow and be brought to market during early spring. Soil 
heating is not a growing method because similar results could be obtained at a lower 
cost by covering the plants with plastic sheets. However, it is estimated that about 
120,000 m2
 of felds are heated this way (Garðarsdóttir et al., 2021) and according to 
the research conducted in Iceland, the data appears to support the hypothesis that heat￾ing with low-grade wastewater can have a meaningful positive impact on plant 
growth rates.
ALDIN Biodome is a pilot project in Elliðaárdalur valley in Reykjavík to investi￾gate the impacts of (and optimal confgurations for) the use of thermal wastewater 
S. S. Nickayin213

in outdoor cultivation with insulated beds in an attempt to increase the outdoor 
crops. Hjördí Sigurðardóttir, the founder of ALDIN Biodome, highlights that almost 
85% of all houses in Iceland are heated with geothermal energy; thus, low-grade 
warm water is particularly abundant per capita in Iceland, as the outfows are dis￾charged at around 30 °C, the disposal of such water is harmful to the environment 
causing thermal pollution.
Despite favourable conditions like abundant summer sunlight, the cold 
Icelandic summers create diffculty for cultivation due to low soil temperatures. 
According to the research conducted by ALDIN Biodome, the data support the 
hypothesis that heating with low-grade wastewater can have a meaningful positive 
impact on plant growth rates (circa 20–180%, depending on the bed, lighting, and 
choice of metric) (Róbertsdóttir, 2020; Vsó Ráðgjöf Ehf, 2020). However, little 
beneft was realised in terms of extending the growing season of sensitive plants.

Although outdoor cultivation via soil heating cannot substitute frost-sensitive 
plant cultivation in heated greenhouses, it appears to be signifcantly cheaper per 
unit area (Róbertsdóttir, 2020; Vsó Ráðgjöf Ehf, 2020), and it provides a middle 
ground between costly greenhouse cultivation and low-yield short-season unheated 
outdoor cultivation (Fig. 12.5).
12.4 Circular Economy and Waste Management
12.4.1 Pure North Recycling
Geothermal wastewater could be used to recycle plastic in a circular economy. Pure 
North Recycling is a plastic waste management company based in Hveragerði, 
45 km from Reykjavík, with a mission to recycle plastic locally. Icelandic plastic 
waste is more commonly used to be shipped to mainland Europe or Asia for recy￾cling or incineration. Pure North Recycling uses extremely hot geothermal waste￾water to clean and recycle the plastic. The temperature of geothermal wastewater in 
Hveragerði is far higher than the water used elsewhere in Europe and Asia, and it 
does not require extra energy to be heated up.
Furthermore, local waste management reduces unnecessary shipment costs and 
carbon footprint from plastic waste by using plastic again locally within a circular 
S. S. Nickayin215
economy. According to a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of recycling 
work at Pure North, it is estimated that each ton of plastic recycled by Pure North
saves 0.7 tons of CO2eq and 1.8 tons of oil; in addition, the processing technique 
reduces additional carbon dioxide of 1.52 CO2eq per ton compared to recycling 
plastic in Europe or Asia (Pure North project, n.d.). Pure North currently recycles 
2500 tons of plastic hay-baling waste annually, and the company aims to double its 
production by 2021. Most prominent Icelandic companies have cooperated with 
Pure North to recycle their plastic. Pure North envisions a future where plastic in 
Iceland is recycled locally over and over in a circular economy, thanks to the abun￾dance of geothermal wastewater.
12.5 Circular Food District
12.5.1 Vaxtarhús
The fnal part of this chapter focuses on the frst attempt of the Reykjavík municipal￾ity to encourage more circular district design within the neighbourhood. Vaxtarhús 
is a winning design proposal for a carbon-neutral development in Bryggjuhverf 
Vestur district of Reykjavík. The proposal is the result of close collaborations with 
different partners (VSÓ Ráðgjöf ehf, Reiulf Ramstad Architects AS, MStudio, 
Sigridur Olafsdottir Grima architects, Íslenskar fasteignir (ÍF), EIK Fasteignafélag 
and The Agriculture University of Iceland) who comes together to share the knowl￾edge of circular economy within different felds. The district will boast Iceland’s 
frst fully circular design, providing a haven for urban farming and dining. The 
district’s design aims to increase the role of urban farming and food security as an 
integral part of a holistic living ecosystem based on circular principles. The core of 
the design is on integrated farming systems utilising public and private space, green￾house development and integration, water use and mitigation, nutrition cycles, com￾post solutions and energy effciency design.
The site is located at the centre of one of the most historical industrial sites of the 
capital area; the presence of two concrete silos is the entrance to the new 
Bryggjuhverf Vestur. The design proposal focuses on revitalising the existing silos 
by giving a new life to serve as a cornerstone for local farming and food services, 
housing a local food hall for inhabitants and visitors to promote the sustainability 
and resiliency of the area. The Circular District aims for a holistic circular solution 
to minimise the negative impacts of construction practices on the climate.
To design such a neighbourhood, different experts from the Icelandic circular 
food ecosystem got a deeper insight into Iceland’s system and gathered knowledge 
that has been useful from the beginning of the design process. The goal was to 
design a system within the Circular District that fosters a healthy food ecosystem 
and creates shared value with circular principles in mind.

The agricultural function design was based on three concepts: On-Site Farming, 
Neighbourhood Farm Service, and Local Food Sourcing.
The growth area was supposed to be located inside three main areas: 
Greenhouses, outdoor growing and in a controlled environment agriculture 
(CEA), transforming the industrial silos into a vertical farm (VAXA FARM, 
approximately 10x40m silos: 800 cubic meters). The design foresaw three strat￾egies to provide adequate space for on-site farming in greenhouses: a. Rooftop 
greenhouse on a new building. b. Connect buildings with greenhouses, which 
will also host a serving area for a restaurant/cafe. c. Expand plot area into 
School plot.
Core neighbourhood farm services are provided by VAXTARHÚS, which 
manages agricultural growth areas in residential clusters (greenhouses and out￾door plants) and public spaces. VAXTARHÚS manages School gardens and allot￾ments on the school property and runs an educational program for school children 
and the public. For food security reasons, carbon footprint, and freshness 
VAXTARHÚS emphasises supporting regional agriculture production. This is 
done with agreements with district food and farming producers and suppliers. 
Regional food is sold in the VAXTARHÚS food store and through Farm Box 
Schemes that will be delivered to the MAT distribution stations.2
 Information on 
local food sourcing programs is communicated to the local area and the broader 
community through The Circular District Digital platform. This information will 
include saved food miles, reduction of carbon footprint and food security level 
from regional food availability. One of the central cores of design processes is 
thermal wastewater management to take advantage of abundant geothermal waste￾water in Iceland (Figs. 12.6, 12.7, 12.8).
12.6 Concluding Remarks
The driving force behind most Icelandic geothermal implants takes into account the 
different types of circular economy that could be combined with thermal water 
waste management.
The functional solutions and circular design are part of policies in geothermal 
implants; the central part of the challenges is to adopt and integrate a new form of 
structures that can also act as potential placemaking elements designed to function 
as recreational and productive areas. Recent projects display examples of mere 
functional structures – like the VAXTARHÚS, Pure North, Friðheimar and ALDIN 
Biodome – as well as multifunctional recreational structures – such as Nauthólsvík 
Geothermal Beach and The Blue Lagoon.
2MAT is a sustainable distribution system for online grocery shopping.

Icelandic geothermal implants are distinct in their holistic wastewater manage￾ment, and their design is rooted in the culture of “survival”, making “habitable” the 
“last edge of the earth”. In the land of Ice and Fire, the design of geothermal implants 
is a fuid approach that fnds new methods to get the best out of a complex inherited 
nature. It demonstrates the Icelandic ingenuine attitude of þetta reddast (it will all 
work out).

Opportunities and Challenges 
to Implement Nature-Based Solutions 
for Urban Waters in Developed 
and Emerging Developed Countries

Abstract The diverse rainfall patterns due to climate change have been the major 
causes of ooding in urban areas, particularly in emerging developed countries, 
where there is a lack of resources for ood mitigation and ineffective infrastructure 
systems. With this comes deterioration in water quality entering the environment 
with pollutants carried by the increased surface runoff, combined with the lack of 
treatment measures. Water sensitive cities promote the integration of water manage￾ment and urban planning, where the application of nature-based solutions (NbS) 
aligns sustainable and adaptation goals and provides better capacity for communi￾ties and environments to adapt and become resilient to climate change. But if NbS 
are so important to build resilience to climate change, why aren’t they thoroughly 
applied? Why aren’t they considered high priority in the hierarchical order of prom￾inent ood and stormwater quality solutions in emerging developed countries where 
resources are scarcer? Are the challenges faced by developed and emerging devel￾oped countries similar? Common knowledge about conventional and non-innovative 
systems and all the involved uncertainties are among the reasons holding back the 
adoption of NbS and promotion of cultural change. This chapter aims to discuss the 
similarities and differences encountered to implement NbS for urban waters.

13.1 Introduction
Climate change is increasing the severity and intensity of extreme events (Steffen 
2021). One of the major impacts is the alteration of rainfall patterns.
In Australia, the foods that swept across South-East Queensland and Northern 
New South Wales in early 2022 caused $4.8 billion in insured damages (Insurance 
Council of Australia 2022). This fgure did not take into account the physiological 
impacts of the community, the loss of lives or the non-insured infrastructure that had 
been damaged and destroyed. In February 2023, more than 1.3 trillion litres of water 
(e.g., at least 600 millimetres of rain in some of the areas on a single day) fooded 
13 municipalities of Sao Paulo, Brazil, causing 64 deaths and leaving 4000 people 
displaced (Guy Carpenter 2023; UOL 2013).
In future climate change scenarios, there is expected to be longer dry spells and 
an increased frequency of heavy storms (UNEP 2022). At the same time, high 
urbanisation rates have maximised deforestation and impervious surfaces, leading 
to increased runoff in urban areas. The lack of vegetation in urban areas changes the 
heat exchange between the surface and atmosphere, which is associated with the 
heat island effect, elevating the frequency of heavy rainfalls, especially in warmer 
seasons. The drainage network capacity is breached due to the stormwater runoff 
excess, as in many cases it has been constructed to meet historical requirements, 
without considering the current scenario, which exposes the urban population to a 
higher risk of fooding and calls for a change in stormwater management (Pimentel 
da Silva and Souza 2020; Batalhao et al. 2023).
Likewise, population increases the effuent volumes, which causes the pollution 
of waterways and reduces the availability of freshwater supply. These issues raise 
the risk of confict over natural resources and have the potential to cause social dis￾turbances and natural disasters, among other problems. Rainwater regimes impact

directly the hydrologic cycle. Thus, higher demands for water supply and enhanced 
food risk require mitigation and adaptation measures.
Cities also play a signifcant (i.e., negative) role in climate change by contribut￾ing to gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. Air pollution is higher in urban areas 
and has proved to be related to many diseases. Green surfaces, which as mentioned 
before tend to be suppressed in urban areas, play an important role in reducing par￾ticulate matter dispersed in the atmosphere from human activities. During dry 
spells, air quality tends to be worse and causes more episodic respiratory problems. 
Heat waves, stormwater pollution and runoff excess are harmful to natural ecosys￾tems and impact human life. They cause economic, social and environmental prob￾lems that challenge sustainable development worldwide.
13.2 Opportunity to Align NbS with Sustainable 
and Adaptation Goals
For millennia the planet has existed through severe natural hazards. It only takes 
human observation to realise that nature, when left without interference, can cope 
with and recover in the most appropriate way to a natural hazard. Vegetated dune 
systems, mangroves and salt marshes are a perfect example of how vegetation can 
buffer a coastline from storm surges.
For decades engineers have been designing solutions to hold at bay, foods and 
coastal storm surges in urban environments using concrete and steel. This infra￾structure has of course served a purpose – to protect property and people. For that, 
this infrastructure must continue to provide access to places and liveability.
The challenge now lies in the fact that dense urban environments with predomi￾nant impervious surfaces are now exacerbating the impacts that they had originally 
been designed to mitigate. So, NbS is an umbrella concept that uses natural systems 
to address climate change challenges.
NbS can vary from large options like allowing coastal wetlands to regrow, to 
smaller solutions such as household green roofs and rain gardens. There are obvious 
synergies between combining the concrete infrastructure with rain gardens or per￾meable surfaces for passive irrigation, stormwater quality control and food mitiga￾tion with the need to make cities cooler through increasing canopy cover and 
vegetation. In addition, promoting the community access to green spaces boosts 
property prices (Norton et al. 2015), enhances physical and mental health (Astell￾Burt and Feng 2019) and enriches biodiversity in local areas by providing food and 
shelter for insects, birds and small mammals.
The ability for NbS to deliver climate change mitigation and adaption benefts 
has not been broadly studied (Seddon et al. 2020) and hence, proposed NbS projects 
may not be trusted and could lead to misinterpretation. No State or Local Government 
Authorities (LGAs) want to be responsible for ripping up a drain to reinstate a more 
naturalised creek without ensuring that food mitigation will be effective.
13 Opportunities and Challenges to Implement Nature-Based Solutions for Urban…224
There are great opportunities for the State and LGAs to engage with communi￾ties, engineers and urban planners to design NbS that meet the intended outcomes. 
It also builds knowledge and educates the community, enabling them to realise that 
human health and biodiversity benefts make NbS worthy and viable alternatives 
when compared to what has traditionally been called grey infrastructure.
NbS are scarcely co-designed with residents or traditional communities. 
Conversely, their involvement in the problem-solving issue could improve their 
knowledge of the topic, social learning, their sense of belonging and motivation for 
environmental stewardship (Kiss et al. 2022).
Nevertheless, increasing the community’s understanding about the importance 
of adapting to climate change is not the only thing needed to develop their indi￾vidual resilience. There must also be support to understand how to adapt, provision 
of the tools and resources to support adaptation and, most importantly, assistance 
in creating community connections.
13.3 Synergy Between Green and Blue Infrastructure
In terms of water management, NbS refer to the use of plants and landscape mea￾sures that allow water to be seen, captured, treated, and utilised in the visual realm. 
In short, natural processes are used or mimicked to improve water management 
(UN-Water 2018). This contrasts with traditional water management that has 
tended to deal with urban water through a network of underground pipes. NbS can 
be seen as an umbrella term for the movement away from hard and grey (concrete) 
infrastructure, to green (representing plant-based approaches) and blue (represent￾ing water) infrastructure.
The use of blue-green infrastructure (BGI) for stormwater management has 
become prevalent in many urban developments. Multiple concepts have developed 
over the past decades to encapsulate this softer approach to urban drainage. Green 
Infrastructure (GI), Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI), Water Sensitive Urban 
Design (WSUD), Low Impact Development (LID), Best Management Practices 
(BMPs), Alternative Techniques (ATs) and Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) 
represent just some of the terminology utilised across the globe (Fletcher 
et al. 2015).
In addition to multiple concepts, NbS for urban water can take many forms. 
This includes, but is not limited to, constructed wetlands, sedimentation basins 
(a.k.a. sediment ponds), stormwater ponds, bioretention basins (a.k.a. bioflters 
and rain gardens), tree pits, retarding basins (a.k.a. retention basins), swales (a.k.a. 
bioswales or buffer strips), living walls (a.k.a. green facades), green walls and 
green roofs. A summary of this infrastructure is provided in Table 13.1.

Table 13.1 Summary of NbS for urban stormwater management
Type Description
Constructed 
Wetland
Primarily used for stormwater treatment, with a minor role in food 
attenuation. Vegetation is critical for nutrient removal within the system 
(Fig. 13.1)
Sedimentation 
Basin (or Sediment 
Pond)
Used to slow incoming stormwater and capture sediment. Typically, the 
open water area is vegetation-free, while perimeter plantings are used to 
restrict access (i.e., safety) (Fig. 13.2)
Stormwater Pond Traditionally designed as open water bodies, with plantings kept to the 
water’s edge. Used chiefy for food mitigation and recreation, rather than 
stormwater treatment (Meierdiercks et al. 2010) (Fig. 13.3)
Bioflter (or 
raingarden or 
bioretention system)
An ephemeral, plant and flter media system constructed principally for 
stormwater treatment. Stormwater is captured at the surface, infltrates 
through the flter media and is evapotranspired. Dense planting is crucial 
to maintaining infltration and pollutant removal, particularly nutrients 
(Barron et al. 2020) (Fig. 13.4)
Green Roof Generally consists of layers of a growing medium, a drainage layer that 
detains rainwater and plants (DEPI 2014). Reductions in stormwater 
volumes and pollutants are due to plant uptake, evaporation and/or use 
within the accompanying building (DEPI 2014) (Fig. 13.5)
Green Wall A vertical vegetated system, with individual plants grown in pots/felt/
boxes and attached to walls/structures (DEPI 2014). Rainwater or 
stormwater can be used to irrigate the system, which reduces stormwater 
volumes requiring conveyance from the site and provides benefts to the 
building (e.g., greening, cooling, amenity) (Fig. 13.6)
Living Wall Rainwater or stormwater harvesting is used in conjunction with vines/
climbing plants grown across a structure. This reduces stormwater 
volumes conveyed to the drainage network and provides benefts to the 
building (e.g., greening, cooling, amenity) (Fig. 13.7)
Retarding Basin (or 
Retention Basin)
Flood mitigation infrastructure that generally presents as a depressed, 
grassed area in the landscape that can be used for recreation in dry 
conditions (Miguez et al. 2007) (Fig. 13.8)
Swale (or bioswale 
or buffer strip or 
open drain)
Channels used to transport stormwater. Vegetation slows stormwater, 
reduces peak fow rates, and encourages pollutant removal (Deletic and 
Fletcher 2006) (Fig. 13.9)
Tree Pit Principally used for the passive irrigation of street trees and bioretention 
media can be incorporated to promote stormwater treatment (Tirpak et al. 
2019) (Fig. 13.10)
13.4 Benefts from Water Sensitive Cities 
to the Circular Economy
A water sensitive city (WSC) is an urban environment that aims to serve a range of 
water resources to provide ecosystem services for social, ecological and economic 
benefts. These benefts include water security and protection of all forms of water 
bodies, be it waterways, wetlands, rivers, bays and coasts. A WSC involves a hydro￾logical system that mitigates risks and impacts of food events, and spaces that col￾lect, flter and recycle water for continual reuse (CRC 2021).

In order to achieve these aims  and cope with the aforementioned challenges 
(i.e., the over-populated cities and expanding infrastructure that places increased 
demand on water resources and creates more wastewater), a new model of manage￾ment is required to re-distribute equitable and available water sources for essential 
quality of life.
Circular Economy redefnes the business-as-usual linear model of ‘take, make, 
consume and waste’, specifcally in relation to the use of natural assets. Circular 
economies design systems that return to principles of natural cycles of restorative 
and regenerative ecosystem services (Raworth 2017).
Creating resilient ecosystem services such as respecting the precious resource 
that is water, requires designing and building cities to ensure rainwater is not treated 
as waste. The global natural water cycle itself is a closed-loop system. It works in 
such a way that the fnite resource is distributed inherently where needed. The 
V. T. G. Boulomytis et al.227

Fig. 13.4 Raingarden, Middle Park, Australia. (Source: Authors)
continual fow consists of transpiration and evaporation – condensation – precipita￾tion – infltration and percolation, perpetually looping biological nutrients for con￾tinual use.
However, this natural cycle has been disturbed in vast areas of urbanised land￾scapes. This disturbance has predominantly been in the form of hard, man-made 
surfaces that either redirect fows or allow water to escape re-use, instead run down 
the drain and out to receiving waterbodies, disrupting the natural fow. We need to 
adapt and re-think our built form and infrastructure to re-balance this cycle and start 
capturing and effectively utilising more stormwater. Thus, we need to make a con￾scious effort to improve stormwater harvesting and recycling water systems, and 
increase permeability, allowing rainfall to flter through the natural substrate.
The Water in Circular Economy and Resilience (WICER) framework focuses on 
a holistic approach, considering supply by diversifying sources and delivering

resilience from planning and investing in climate and other uncertainties. Minimising 
use and impacts, recovering resources by designing out negative externalities, 
restoring degraded land and watersheds, recharging aquifers, and signifcantly 
incorporating NbS to ultimately preserve and regenerate natural systems (Van 
Zanten et al. 2023).
13.5 Cost-Beneft for the Community Wellbeing
Human activity has accumulated and placed unprecedented stress on the planet’s 
life-giving systems, creating extremes in human circumstance. Degradation of natu￾ral processes has led to rising temperatures, increasing intensity and scale of 
droughts, storms, foods, sea-level rise and degraded agricultural land. As such, it is

(Source: Authors)
estimated that two out of three people will live in water-stressed regions worldwide 
by 2025 (Raworth 2017).
Global development goals such as those considered in Doughnut economics set 
out to establish alleviation of environmental pressures [including freshwater with￾drawals] by setting an ecological ceiling and a social foundation, with the ‘sweet 
spot’ lying within. Above the ecological ceiling is the overshoot where unsustain￾able pressures of the earth’s systems are leading to ongoing climate change impacts. 
Below the social foundation are shortfalls in human wellbeing, a lack of access to 
life’s basic needs including clean water (Raworth 2017).
Social sustainability and wellbeing have in recent times made resurgence in the 
concept of the ‘triple bottom line’ accounting, rebalancing the hierarchy of eco￾nomic, environmental and social sustainability. As such, the way in which we defne

(Source: Authors)
the allocation of costs and benefts in determining a resource value also requires a 
way in which to measure community wellbeing.
Ecosystem services, specifcally in reference to the values of NbS, involve clean 
water, resource effciency, food security, disaster risk reduction, climate control 
(e.g., cooling for Urban Heat Island effect), and ultimately health and wellbeing.
Cost-beneft analysis methodology basically evaluates all the pros and cons in 
deciding between a number of actions or situations, with the advantages based in 
quantifable monetary terms. The costs of continuing current detrimental practices 
to the earth’s water systems include poor water quality and increased food events 
all adding to already high economic pressures. The benefts of returning to Nbs 
involve not only aesthetic and recreational value, Biophilia principles, and urban 
cooling, but the capacity for access to clean water by restoring disturbed systems, 
fows and returning to natural distribution patterns.
V. T. G. Boulomytis et al.231
Social cost-beneft analysis predominantly seeks to evaluate cost effciencies, 
and quantifying non-economic values. Social Return on Investment (SROI) is con￾sidered the ‘value add’ to community on investments in fnancial/economic terms. 
Essentially quantifying the ‘not only’ social, but environmental and non-economic 
benefts obtained through investing in asset improvements, in attempts to level the 
playing feld of triple bottom line accountability. Well-being Valuation Analysis
builds upon SROI and traditional methods, whereby subjective social wellbeing 
impacted by a good or service is estimated, then calculated to gauge the exact 
amount of money to produce an equivalent impact (Kraatz et al. 2015).
NbS harness the power of nature to strengthen climate resilience and foster 
shared economic and social prosperity. By protecting, restoring and enhancing 
existing ecosystems and all water bodies is the most cost-effective way in which to 
improve water quality and quantity that is more equitably distributed. Along with 
regenerating existing blue infrastructure, utilising already built grey infrastructure 
(such as buildings) and augmenting with green infrastructure (green roofs, walls 
and facades) to maximise benefts while minimising costs and trade-offs (Van 
Zanten et al. 2023).
13.6 Diffculty to Promote Cultural and Behavioural Change
Behaviour change begins with awareness of a particular issue or challenge that 
requires a new or different solution. Then motivating and persuading others to take 
action by educating and facilitating the practice towards the desired behaviour, and 
maintenance to sustain the behaviour via reminders and reinforcing communica￾tions, along with evidence of benefcial outcomes (Laland 2004).
Diffculties applying behaviour change theory are that of knowledge to intention 
to action, what motivates choices, perceived control and psychological barriers to 
attaining action competence in view of changing behaviour. A general sense of pow￾erlessness occurs where status is embedded in collective agency that defnes motives, 
culture and social practice (Kenis and Mathijs 2012).
The aforementioned Social Cost Beneft determines whether a stated or revealed 
preference of willingness to pay for a said outcome or service also considers con￾sumer behaviour (Kraatz et al. 2015). Determining the benefts by placing value on 
a NbS can go a long way to shifting behaviour.
Value is most often determined in economic terms of rational, calculated, quan￾tifable assumptions of believed to be ‘best’ preferences, where the end justifes the 
scarce means. Whereas, ecology, or more specifcally NbS, looks at the inter￾relationships within natural systems as well as social connections with them. 
Working with nature can lead to successful cultural adoptions of symbiotic feed￾backs to obtain mutually benefcial behavioural traits and ultimately best practice 
water use (Laland 2004).
Culturally, mainstream conformity bias where following the majority [to achieve 
acceptance] along with risk aversion to change and a belief that we can only beneft 
13 Opportunities and Challenges to Implement Nature-Based Solutions for Urban…232
from having control over and above another [ecological] entity results in reversion 
to a predisposed or acquired mindset and the perpetuation of the same detrimental 
outcomes (Laland 2004).
Incentivising the uptake or ongoing practice of WICER’s Behavioural R’s of 
reduce, reuse, recycle, replenish, recover and retain and the ‘less is more’ concept 
to prompt behavioural change to use less water requires knowledge and value 
(Delgado et al. 2021). Being responsive and adapting to dynamic changes within the 
environment means conscious refexive change.
There is much that can be learnt and adopted from First Nations people and their 
relationship to water. It is of high value and critical to human needs and as such 
protecting and managing water is seen as a custodial responsibility.
For First People, water is a sacred source of life. The natural fow of water sustains aquatic 
ecosystems that are central to our spirituality, our social and cultural economy and wellbe￾ing. The rivers are the veins of Country, carrying water to sustain all parts of our sacred 
landscape. The wetlands are the kidneys, fltering the water as it passes through the land. 
First Nations Peoples have rights and a moral obligation to care for water under their law 
and customs. These obligations connect across communities and language groups, extend￾ing to downstream communities, throughout catchments and over connected aquifer and 
groundwater systems (Australia SOE 2021).
13.7 Implementation Barriers: Conventional Versus 
Alternative Approaches
There are similarities and differences in the challenges facing developed and devel￾oping countries in incorporating nature-based solutions for urban water manage￾ment. At the macro scale this can be viewed through the framework proposed by 
Brown et  al. (2009), in which the journey to water sustainability relates to both 
socio-political drivers and service delivery functions.
For developed countries, it was hypothesised that there has been a transition in 
the approach to water urban management: from meeting personal needs for water 
security, through to protection objectives, then awareness of environmental impact 
and limitations and onto a more adaptive approach. With each of these transitions, 
there has been associated infrastructure included within cities to meet the new 
requirements. Hard, grey and concrete infrastructure was introduced for water sup￾ply and wastewater discharge, along with the fast conveyance of stormwater out of 
urban areas. As such, the conventional approach to stormwater management has 
been primarily through a network of underground pipes or open channels.
As the negative impacts of this approach to receiving waterways and liveability 
have become apparent, such as stormwater pollution and the urban heat island 
effect, retroftting established areas with NbS and its inclusion within new develop￾ments has become more widespread. However, this comes with challenges as the 
feasibility, particularly cost, can be a signifcant barrier in adapting already estab￾lished drainage systems. There are also community expectations to contend with. 
V. T. G. Boulomytis et al.233
For instance, if they are familiar with the conventional approach and water being 
drained from the landscape but are then encountering NbS with water being cap￾tured and stored in the landscape, this can be a gap in understanding that requires 
educational programs for NbS acceptance.
In contrast, emerging developed countries may have the opportunity to install 
NbS as the primary infrastructure for stormwater management. Conceptually, 
emerging developed countries are likely to be earlier in the transition’s framework 
proposed by Brown et al. (2009), which means the dominance of pit and pipe net￾works is likely to be less established. In this way, developing countries have an 
opportunity to leapfrog several of the stages developed countries have undertaken 
on the path to NbS (Poustie et  al. 2016). However, there are again community 
expectations to manage. For instance, there could be the expectation that developing 
cities should be provided with the same conventional infrastructure as developed 
cities, with NbS viewed as an inferior replacement.
Ultimately, the inclusion of NbS in developed or emerging developed countries 
is not a technical conversation about infrastructure, but rather is highly dependent 
on the socio-political context (Barron et al. 2017). These drivers will be different at 
the local scale. In terms of infrastructure with any NbS, their planning, design, con￾struction and maintenance requirements need to be well-considered and 
site-specifc.
13.8 Functionality Uncertainties: Design, Construction 
and Maintenance
Despite the increasing prevalence of NbS over the last few decades, there are still 
functionality concerns in relation to design, construction, and maintenance. In com￾parison to construction and maintenance, the design process of NbS is probably the 
most advanced aspect. Local design standards and numerous modelling software 
are now available to guide designers. The creation of this knowledge for developing 
countries will be a key aspect to the success of NbS that needs to be site-specifc and 
designed for the local climate.
The transfer of design plans to construction teams should be undertaken with 
caution. Contractors not conversant in the functional aspects of NbS can approach 
these projects from a standard civil or landscaping background. This is less of a 
concern for infrastructure such as wetlands, basins and ponds which are largely 
earth-removing and planting exercises, and more of an issue for systems utilising 
bioretention technology. Contamination of the flter media during transport and 
placement, over compaction of flter media layers and sourcing/using media that 
does not meet requirements (e.g., infltration capacity) are common occurrences. 
Unfortunately, if onsite supervision and testing is not undertaken, then these prob￾lems remain hidden until the system experiences surface issues, such as water pond￾ing for extended periods of time, algae build-up, and plant death. These issues are 
13 Opportunities and Challenges to Implement Nature-Based Solutions for Urban…234
diffcult to resolve once the contractor has completed the works, with the asset 
becoming a liability for owners and costly to resolve.
Maintenance is a critical aspect to the ultimate success of any NbS. While they 
require low technical maintenance, they are not no-maintenance. Routine mainte￾nance requirements include such tasks as cleaning inlets and outlets of debris, 
removing litter and leaf build-up, pruning, weeding, and plant replacement. These 
should be undertaken regularly, such as monthly or seasonally. Unfortunately, these 
tasks are regularly missed and undertaken poorly. Non-routine maintenance is also 
important and includes those tasks that need to be taken on a yearly or multi-year 
basis. This includes tasks such as small-scale flter media replacement for bioreten￾tion systems, dewatering and sediment removal from basins, wetlands and ponds, 
and large-scale replanting. When adequate maintenance is not completed, NbS will 
deteriorate quicker than their design life, they may become unsafe, they will not 
perform as intended (e.g., treatment reduced, smaller volumes captured) and may be 
complained on by residents. Figure  13.11 provides some examples of common 
maintenance issues.
13.9 Final Discussion
Even though NbS have numerous possibilities to improve the water conditions in 
urban areas, they still have to cope with diffculties that differ in scale and complex￾ity from developed and emerging developed countries.
Emerging developed countries tend to be defcient in urban planning and inte￾grated water management, particularly alongside rivers and coastal zones where the 
urban population is dense. It normally occurs due to scarce fnancial resources avail￾able for planning or social aspects, such as illegal occupation of vulnerable areas to 
cover the defcit of social housing. For instance, Brazil has a shortage of more than 
six million homes, where more than 25 million people live in insuffcient conditions 
(Habitat for Humanity 2017). In these areas, water supply and sanitation conditions 
(i.e., drainage, waste management and sewerage collection) are also faulty, which 
are basic liveability principles, making the concern towards biodiversity and storm￾water quality control not a direct priority to promote community wellbeing.
Besides that, public transparency is not always present in emerging developed 
countries, favouring the practice of corruption and making the governance against 
real estate speculation a fragile system. If the economic aspects dominate the urban￾isation process and the interests of developing an area are not in the same level of 
environmental vulnerability, the deliberation of political actions tends to impact the 
population welfare (Boulomytis et al. 2017, Seller 2014). For social adaptation, the 
decision-making process towards social equality, population growth balance and 
available natural resources needs to be properly carried out (Salinas Chaves 1998).
Furthermore, where there is lack of knowledge and trust on the NbS benefts, 
both from engineers, planners and the community, their implementation becomes 
V. T. G. Boulomytis et al.235
Fig. 13.11 Examples of common maintenance issues for NbS: (a) Algae build-up on bioretention 
system, (b) weed coverage over water area of sediment pond, (c) clogged flter media causing 
extended ponding on bioretention surface, (d) inlet blocked with sediment and leaf debris. (Source: 
Authors)
less feasible, making the conventional systems preferable, even when their cost 
is higher.
Another important consideration is that food risk and stormwater quality control 
need to be estimated or monitored to advance the implementation or maintenance of 
drainage systems in combination, or not with NbS. Lack of performance checks 
seems to be a common issue for developed and emerging developed countries. 
However, emerging developed countries have limited resources and monitoring data 
are expensive and time-consuming (Boulomytis et  al. 2016) making them more 
scarce than in developed countries.
The benefts of implementing NbS are directly related to the community wellbe￾ing, but this is challenging when asset management fails the maintenance and oper￾ations of these systems. If the community loses trust on the non-conventional 
systems, it becomes more diffcult to implement them again, except if they are 
13 Opportunities and Challenges to Implement Nature-Based Solutions for Urban…236
properly educated about the problems. This engagement is not always easy or fast, 
making it even more challenging to use the local funds on something that is not 
approved by the community. Similar problems should be expected when faulty 
design, construction, maintenance or operations occur in conventional systems. 
Nonetheless, the community and all stakeholders are already aware of their con￾straints because of their historical and cultural involvement with these conventional 
systems, making their failure cause ‘less’ impact on their future implementation.
13.10 Conclusions
Human interference in the hydrological cycle has largely been undertaken to pro￾vide comfort and natural resources for human needs, with negative long-term 
impacts on water resources. There are three essential actions to minimise these 
impacts: (i) adapt human habits to reduce consumption, (ii) optimise the use of 
natural resources, and (ii) manage our systems in a more sustainable way. The three 
items are related to the use of NbS in urban water and promotion of a circular 
economy.
Reducing water consumption and using it more effciently means that we should 
change our habits but also reduce stormwater and greywater waste. Thus, more 
recycling water or stormwater harvesting systems need to be implemented. For the 
treatment of stormwater, NbS offer a straightforward beneft, enhancing biodiver￾sity, promoting community health and wellbeing in cooling areas covered by can￾opy supplied by passive irrigation or even irrigation using the alternative water 
resources (i.e., stormwater or recycled water) instead of potable water.
The combination of conventional (i.e., concrete and impervious infrastructure 
and drainage network with pipes and pumps) and non-conventional systems, such 
as the NbS provide a social cost-beneft and high ecosystem services. It is a fact that 
both systems need effective design, maintenance and operations, and to promote 
trust with the community, State and LGAs need to invest in their education to build 
knowledge among stakeholders. Also, the community needs to feel that they belong 
to the problem-solving and decision-making processes. This is only possible when 
there is effective engagement and the governance model is participatory. All these 
are key drivers for the achievement of sustainable development goals, adaptation 
and resilience to climate change.

Water Sensitive Design and Nature-Based 
Solutions for the Circular Management 
of Urban Water: Challenges and Missed 
Opportunities in the Auckland Region
Iresh Jayawardena
Abstract This chapter investigates current approaches to urban water management 
outcomes in the Auckland region as a case study and considers challenges and 
missed opportunities in order to achieve a circular urban water management initia￾tive within existing practice. The chapter begins by providing an overview of the 
current state of urban water management in the region and the drivers of change. 
The use of the case study approach is a valuable tool for understanding and improv￾ing the circular management of urban water, as it allowed us to deep dive into the 
existing implementation mechanism of water utilities, including strategic planning, 
and to consider the complex interplay of various factors that inuence the role of 
water and its management practices.
The review of current strategic planning, technical guidance and policy processes 
on urban water management presented in the Auckland context provided an oppor￾tunity to identify challenges, missed opportunities, and governance issues surround￾ing the problem that inhibits emerging alternatives of circular management of urban 
water solutions in Auckland. Chapter discussions also consider the understanding 
between people, technology, natural systems, and processes and how they interact 
with local planning systems and WSD guidelines, identifying and analysing barriers 
to the uptake of circular urban water management in the Auckland region. The con￾clusion of the chapter identies the main barriers and enablers to the wider adoption 
of circular urban water through these approaches in the Auckland region and pro￾vides recommendations for policy and practice.

14.1 Introduction
Urban water is one of the few essential resources that keep cities and households 
healthy and clean and is also largely controlled by urban growth management strate￾gies, planning, and engineering controls. Water has continued to appear in various 
forms of natural and man-made infrastructure in urban environments, such as large 
reservoirs, rivers, canals, network of pipes, water in-tap, drainages, and treatment 
plants that provide both necessary services and amenities. This has resulted in the 
control of urban water resources as a crucial urban infrastructure and has occurred 
more rapidly in both developed and developing world. Therefore, it is necessary to 
rethink a transformative urban water management system through the lens of circu￾lar economy and resilience without considering it as just a mere resource. It has a 
greater value and offers a far-outside service than a basic human need and a recre￾ational demand.
Within the Auckland context, increasing density, population growth, and impacts 
of climate change continue to disrupt urban environments. By 2040, the impact of 
climate change and extreme events will be obvious; in some cases, it can be devas￾tating, in particular, for heavily populated areas (Auckland Plan 2022). Therefore, 
the consumption and control of urban water systems are now beginning to adapt 
in order to cope with changing pressures but often struggling to meet the needs of 
current demands or fail (Niknam et al. 2022). As a result, modern hydrological and 
engineering systems for managing water in the region have increasingly shifted the 
focus on adapting to low-impact or nature-based approaches. For instance, water￾sensitive design (WSD), Green Infrastructure (GI), nature-based solutions (NbS), 
and Low Impact Urban Design and Development (LIUDD) have been introduced as 
interdisciplinary nature-based approaches to address issues of urban stormwater 
management in Auckland.
The management of stormwater and receiving water bodies is a signifcant area 
of focus for WSD in New Zealand. However, the potential role of WSD in the water 
supply and wastewater sectors, as well as its wider contributions to enhancing urban 
liveability (including non-water aspects), have not been given much consider￾ation (Moores et al. 2018). WSD help replicate natural hydrological processes and 
mitigate the negative impact of urbanisation on water resources and also helps cities 
adapt to climate change, balance land development with ecosystem services, and 
improve human health and well-being (Booth 2020; Ira & Simcock 2019). NbS are 
another initiative that has been gaining attention as a means of addressing pressing 
environmental challenges in cities. NbS aim to protect, restore, and integrate biodi￾versity and ecosystems, while promoting the integration of nature to improve human 
and environmental well-being (Hobbie and Grimm 2020). Like WSD, NbS are 
grounded in the concept of ecological services, where natural components are inte￾grated into urban environments to provide solutions for adaptation to climate 
change, restoration and protection, stormwater management, coastal resilience, 
food reduction, and improved water quality (Escobedo et al. 2019).
I. Jayawardena241
Although both WSD and NbS share a common goal of improving the ecology of 
urban environments, WSD has been the most common practice in Auckland.
It is the key term used to document the circularity of water in the region. By 
adopting WSD and other similar initiatives such as green infrastructure (GI) and 
low impact development (LID), Auckland can achieve its water management goals 
while ensuring the sustainable development of the region.
Figure 14.1 depicts the Auckland  Regional Boundary in New Zealand.  In 
Auckland, 64% of drinking water comes from dams and 31% from rivers (Watercare 
2021). Each day, Auckland’s population requires around 326 million litres of 
water, treats, and discharges approximately 410 million litres of wastewater 
(Watercare 2015). These wastewater networks are facilitated through approximately 
7999 kilometres of pipes and 18 treatment plants (Watercare 2022).
The chapter evaluated current mechanisms for implementing WSD and NbS 
practices in the Auckland region to assess the challenges and missed opportunities 
of circular management of urban water. This chapter examined how well current 
water-related planning, policies, strategies, and management practices in the 
Auckland region have been implemented WSD and NbS and analysed how well 
these policies have recognised the full value of urban water (a resource, a service, 
an amenity, an input into processes and waste) in responding to challenges in the 
urban sector. The chapter elucidates the knowledge of current urban water manage￾ment in Auckland through WSD and NbS and contributes to identifying challenges 
and missed opportunities for the circular management of urban water through these 
practices in the region.

14.2 Materials and Methods
The chapter was developed using a case study approach that involved a review of 
planning and policy documents related to the control, protect, manage, and delivery 
of urban water resource and supply in the Auckland context. The review focused on 
identifying the implementation of WSD and NbS planning principles and proce￾dures to achieve and direct urban water outcomes in the built environment, includ￾ing their challenges and opportunities. Key planning and policy documents that 
have been prepared in support of strategic planning in the Auckland region were 
analysed, namely, The Auckland Plan 2050, the Auckland Unitary (Operative) Plan 
2016, the Auckland Water Strategy 2022–2050, Infrastructure Strategy 2018–2028 
and the Auckland Climate Plan 2020. The aim of these plans is to improve the resil￾ience, sustainability, and effciency outcomes of the region in the long term, hence 
a set of strategies, guidance, and targets are provided. To assess the challenges and 
missed opportunities for the circular level of water management, the chapter evalu￾ated the implementation of WSD and NbS practices in the Auckland region. The 
stated planning and policy instruments used for this document have been produced 
primarily by Auckland Council and its Council Controlled Organisations, including 
Watercare Services Ltd. (Watercare). When reviewing the policies, the author also 
incorporated observations and applied stormwater management practices from his 
experience working in Auckland’s water sector.
These plans and policies include a large number of frameworks and approaches 
that describe the process through which policies are developed and implemented for 
urban water management, addressing the objectives and motives behind policies 
that help identify key actions needed to achieve sustainable outcomes to become 
circular in water. Once policy data has been collected, the author examined these 
policies to identify governance contexts, key issues, policy milestones, and out￾comes to transition to design for circular water management. The author observed 
and extracted contextual information from these policy documents to identify the 
extent to which the WSD and NbS approaches have been impacted and presented 
using these policies and how these policy approaches have currently enabled the 
water management outcomes through circularity. The results of the document anal￾ysis identifed current barriers, strengths and weaknesses in water management 
practices, as well as missed opportunities for the potential improvements and inno￾vations of circular water management in Auckland.
14.3 The Vital Importance of Urban Water Resource 
Management: The New Zealand Context
In New Zealand, the vital importance of water is highlighted  by the concept of 
te mana o te wai (well-being of water); the national direction of freshwater manage￾ment as required under the National Policy on Freshwater Management 2020 (MfE 
2020). The appreciation of the mana (prestige) of freshwater is a top priority in New 
I. Jayawardena243
Zealand, and te mana o te wai expresses the special connection that all New 
Zealanders have with water, in particular, for managing freshwater resources. 
Addressing te mana o te wai requires a hierarchy of obligations which primarily 
begins with the giving effects to the values of tangata whenua (the people of the 
land). Therefore, key national guidance, regional and local policy guidance, and 
other investment choices with respect to water, particularly in urban areas, must be 
made to make improvements to restore healthy waterways. Again, this demonstrates 
the value of water and the partnership that key government institutions must estab￾lish in collaboration with Māori (New Zealand’s indigenous population) to restore 
mana in Auckland’s urban water management.
In 2022, Auckland Council implemented the Auckland Water Strategy 
(2022–2050). The purpose of this strategic plan was to protect and improve te mauri 
o te wai, which means that the life-sustaining capacity of Auckland’s water must be 
protected and improved for the future. The Auckland Plan 2050 provides the long￾term development strategy, outcomes, and measures and shows how the city is 
expected to grow in the next 30 years. The plan provides six key outcomes that are 
to be achieved with a vision of becoming a green Auckland by 2050. In this plan, the 
urban water resource has been identifed as one of the six key priority areas for the 
beneft of present and future generations. Auckland Plan 2050 identifes challenges 
associated with the long-term impacts of water, which can be further exacerbated by 
preexisting challenges already due to climate change.
WSDs have been practiced for decades in New Zealand and have been the pre￾ferred approach to new developments to incorporate integrated management of 
urban stormwater, to improve water quality outcomes and to promote water reuse 
where possible (Ira & Simcock 2019). According to Auckland Council’s Guideline 
Document 04 (GD04), WSDs are encouraged to apply within the land use planning 
and development stages, taking into account the spatial scale from catchment to 
subcatchment and to neighbourhood or development site stages (Auckland Council 
2015). However, there are barriers to its widespread adoption and in particular to 
achieve its full benefts of managing urban stormwater through WSD outcomes 
(Moores and Batstone 2019).
The potential for circular management of urban water prioritises multiple uses, 
recovery, and resilience within urban water systems. Circular management discour￾ages linear approaches that focus on the reconfguration, collection, treatment, and 
discharge of urban water. Circular water management is centred around resource 
recovery and considers the design and delivery of urban water systems as restorative 
systems or ecosystems so that cities can be built and adapt to climate change, other 
natural processes and to meet growing demand.
14.4 Strategic Planning and Auckland’s Urban Water Sector
The Auckland region is the largest metropolitan area in New Zealand, located in 
the north of the North Island with approximately 500,000 hectares of land cover. 
The most urbanised portion of Auckland is located centrally on a narrow isthmus of 
volcanic rock between the Manuakau and Waitemata harbours.

Fig. 14.2 Existing strategic planning, policy, and technical instruments that infuence urban water 
outcomes and the potential for water circularity in the Auckland region. (Prepared by the author)
The current population of Auckland is about 1.6 million, with approximately 
1.4 million residing in urban areas. The region is governed by the Auckland Council. 
As shown in Fig. 14.2, Auckland Council has developed and implemented several 
strategic planning approaches as the primary local government institution respon￾sible for the overall planning and development of the region. These planning instru￾ments continue to manage and regulate the urban water sector and infrastructures 
and are giving top priority to the development of existing and future urban areas.
The conventional approach to managing water in Auckland since the early nine￾teenth century, when colonial settlers arrived, was to classify it into three categories: 
drinking, waste, and storm (Auckland Council 2022). This approach has infuenced 
the way we manage and deliver urban water, through what is known as the three￾water system: potable water, wastewater, and stormwater. Watercare owns and man￾ages the water and wastewater network in the Auckland region. Meanwhile, the 
Auckland Transport own the stormwater network draining the roads and Auckland 
Council’s Healthy Waters Department manages the remainder of the stormwater 
drainage network.
The Auckland Council’s objective is to establish and maintain comprehensive 
networks of drinking, waste, and stormwater infrastructure to meet the city’s 
increasing demands while ensuring public health and safety and preserving environ￾mental outcomes  (Auckland Council 2018). However, as the city continues to

expand, the challenges associated with the urban water sector also grow. Although 
the Auckland Plan 2050 aims to make Auckland the most liveable city in the future, 
the plan does not offer sufcient guidance on how the city’s water sector will 
develop in a way that can contribute to achieving sustainable development goals. 
For instance, we are moving away from the current unsustainable linear approach to 
urban water, which involves taking, making, consuming, and wasting, towards a 
circular model that acknowledges the complete value of urban water resources.
As shown in Fig.  14.3, Auckland Council undertook a benchmarking and 
assessment against the Water Sensitive Cities index process in order to gain a 
comprehensive and unied understanding of the region’s progress in becoming more 
water-sensitive. This involved examining various aspects of the region in a holistic 
manner. The report analysed the city’s approach in terms of its aspirations, policies, 
and specic project examples. According to the study, the region was discovered to 
be functioning entirely as a “water supply city” and a “sewered city”, with only 4% 
of its efforts focused on becoming a water sensitive city (Clarke et al. 2021).
In the following section, the author will discuss the current strategic planning 
instruments and their effectiveness in recognising and capturing the value of urban 
water, which is critical for establishing a circular system in the Auckland region.
14.4.1 The Auckland Plan 2050
The Auckland Plan 2050 is the top-tier strategic planning framework for the 
Auckland Council, outlining the city’s vision for the next three decades, hence 
encompasses a range of strategies and plans that are developed within its strategic 
framework and implemented accordingly. According to the Auckland Plan, the 
city’s population is expected to grow by an additional 720,000 people, reaching a 
14 Water Sensitive Design and Nature-Based Solutions for the Circular Management…246
total of 2.4 million over the next 30 years (Auckland Council 2018). This growth 
is likely to pose signifcant challenges for the region, including the need for an 
additional 313,000 dwellings and other infrastructure to support the expanding 
population. Population growth in Auckland is driven by natural growth and migra￾tion from overseas and other parts of New Zealand, and the Auckland Plan recog￾nises the potential long-term effects of this development.
To address the impacts and demands of development in the region, the Auckland 
Plan promotes growth potential and outlines six main strategic outcomes (Auckland 
Council 2018). The plan aims to achieve cultural and economic success while also 
addressing the need to manage pressures on communities, the environment, and 
other infrastructure. The Auckland Plan anticipates that 32% of the growing popu￾lation will be accommodated within intensive living and working environments 
and built around future urban areas. This plan also anticipates achieving urban 
development by protecting the natural environment and also limiting urban sprawl 
in Auckland.
The Auckland Plan envisions an increase in water supply to meet growing 
demand while recognising the role of green infrastructure (GI) in promoting sus￾tainability and protecting and restoring the natural environment. The plan empha￾sises the importance of GI and mentions it approximately 21 times. Additionally, 
the plan encourages environmentally sensitive approaches, such as the preference 
for WSD, mentioned only three times, to minimise the impacts and costs of cli￾mate change, improve water management, and promote resilience and sustainable 
environmental outcomes.
On page 168 of the Auckland Plan 2050, there is a reference to the circular 
economy as a concept, emphasising the benefts of having policies that consider 
the whole-of-life cycle of a product. However, the Auckland Plan does not fully 
advocate for the potential of circularity to address Auckland’s future challenges 
associated with urban water management. Although the plan acknowledges the 
need for new approaches to deliver old services, such as wastewater recycling, 
there are no specifc requirements in place to enforce this. Additionally, on page 
158, the plan acknowledges the use of WSD as a concept to improve water quality 
and conservation, but it does not provide any guidance or targets for addressing 
water circularity through WSD or GI implementation over the long term. This is 
despite the technical documentation available in the Auckland Design Manual.
14.4.2 Auckland Unitary Plan
The Auckland Unitary Plan (AUP) is the key strategic land use planning document 
for the Auckland region, which was adopted by the Auckland Council in 2016 to 
implement the vision of the Auckland 30-year plan. The AUP aims to guide the 
growth and development of the region in a sustainable and coordinated manner and 
provide a framework for the growth and development of the Auckland region, 
while also ensuring that the natural and built environment is protected and enhanced. 
I. Jayawardena247
AUP enables the use of natural and physical resources, including land development 
activities within the Auckland region. AUP also includes the Regional Policy 
Statement, Regional Plan, and Regional Coastal Plan for Auckland.
The AUP includes policy guidelines, planning rules, and specifc provisions for 
the use and development of land, as well as requirements for environmental protec￾tion, heritage conservation, and infrastructure. These planning and guidelines iden￾tify residential, business, commercial, and industrial areas that are existing and will 
be future, including places for regionally signifcant infrastructure. The AUP also 
provides guidance on the design and layout of new developments, including the 
provision of open space and amenities. The plan is reviewed and updated regularly 
to ensure that it is relevant and effective in meeting the needs of the region.
It is important to note that the AUP does not explicitly address circular water 
management, but rather focuses on the integration of stormwater management with 
land use planning to achieve water quality outcomes. Although the AUP does not 
mention WSD or GI, it promotes the use of low-impact design techniques to man￾age stormwater discharge and runoff. The AUP also includes guidelines for devel￾opers to incorporate integrated stormwater management into their designs, ensuring 
that new developments contribute to the overall management of stormwater in the 
region. However, the AUP does not provide specifc targets or requirements for the 
adoption of circular water management practices in the region.
14.4.2.1 Auckland Stormwater
In AUP Chapter E (Auckland-wide) includes a range of planning and policy sec￾tions that support stormwater and wastewater network management requirements 
(Table 14.1). Provisions for stormwater management and water quality; stream pro￾tection; stormwater discharge treatment; land use controls for stormwater manage￾ment area fows (SMAF); and subdivision controls are particularly important for 
achieving integrated stormwater management outcomes. These provisions help pro￾tect and enhance waterways and wetlands. The promotion of water-effcient tech￾nologies and the reuse and recycling of water is also a step towards a more circular 
approach to urban water management. This includes the promotion of greywater 
systems and the use of rainwater harvesting for irrigation and other non-potable 
purposes. It is also important to note the existence of the Stormwater Bylaw 2015, 
the Stormwater Code of Practise 2015, Stormwater Network Discharge Consent, 
Auckland Transport Design Manual, and Watercare Code of Practise 2015, which 
provide guidance for the management and regulation of stormwater in Auckland.
14.4.2.2 Water Sensitive Design and Guidance Document 04
WSD is an approach to urban planning and design that aims to reduce the impact of 
urban development on water resources. It involves designing and managing the 
built environment in a way that manages challenges such as stormwater runoff,

food risk, water supply security, water quality of aquatic systems, and promotes the 
use of alternative sources of water such as rainwater harvesting.
Auckland Council’s Guidance Document 04 (GDO4) offers guidance on imple￾menting Water Sensitive Design (WSD) in freshwater management and land use 
planning and development (Lewis et al. 2015). The goal is to protect and improve 
natural ecosystems, leading to better outcomes by limiting stormwater runoff and 
reducing contamination. The Auckland Council has implemented several initiatives 
to promote WSD through integrated stormwater management, which embodies key 
WSD principles for managing stormwater discharges. This approach aims to protect 
and enhance the quality of the receiving water bodies, their conservation, and 
sustainability, as refected in GDO4 (Lewis et al. 2015).
I. Jayawardena249
The stormwater infrastructure is under increasing pressure due to the effects of 
climate change, including sea level rise and more frequent extreme weather events. 
Consequently, there is a growing need for resources and guidance for developers, 
designers, and planners to build water-effcient infrastructure and develop innova￾tive solutions for water management in the region. A comprehensive approach to 
WSD is more benefcial than limited integrated stormwater management. WSD 
practices integrate circular water management by balancing water infows and 
outfows so that the development of WSD reduces the water entering and leaving 
systems by focusing on water-effcient buildings and infrastructure. Introducing a 
WSD Fund that provides fnancial support to projects promoting circularity in water 
management in areas subject to growth and urbanisation can also help to assist in 
increased demand for potable water. Urbanisation and growth have increased storm￾water runoff and demand for potable water, so WSD is vital to ensure long-term 
sustainability in the Auckland region. The WSD will play a crucial role in helping 
the region adapt to the impacts of climate change and population growth.
In practice, the full potential of implementing WSD and NbS approaches appears 
to have been limited or fragmented in the Auckland region. Implementing WSD 
must be complemented by good land use planning. Unfortunately, as market size, 
transport, and businesses expand, land fragmentation can lead to poor WSD uptake. 
This issue creates missed opportunities to plan and design new developments and 
retroft existing ones.
14.4.3 Water and Wastewater in Auckland
During the settlement and metropolitan development of Auckland in the nineteenth 
century, wastewater was initially discharged untreated into nearby waterways. As 
the population continued to grow, the dramatic impact of wastewater prompted the 
introduction of treatment schemes. Between 1998 and 2005, Watercare completed 
one of New Zealand’s largest environmental restoration programmes through the 
development of the Mangere treatment plant. This initiative addressed the urgent 
need for a comprehensive wastewater treatment solution in the region.
The Waikato River is the largest contributor of water to Auckland, both currently 
and for the future. As the Auckland region grows rapidly, the demand for natural 
resources such as water is expected to increase in parallel with population growth. 
In 2022, 20-year consent was granted to allow the extraction of up to 150 million 
litres of water per day from the Waikato River to meet Auckland’s growing potable 
water demand (Auckland Council 2022). This consent is in addition to an existing 
active consent for 150 million litres per day.
Watercare collects water from dams in the Waitakere and Hunua peaks, the 
Waikato River and from groundwater. From November 2019 to April 30, 2020, the 
amount of rainfall that Hunua Ranges received was 311 mm as compared to normal 
rainfall for the same period of 716 mm (Aurecon 2021). In recent years, securing a 
reliable water supply has become a signifcant challenge for Auckland, with factors 
14 Water Sensitive Design and Nature-Based Solutions for the Circular Management…250
such as climate change and the risk of droughts impacting the region’s water avail￾ability, resources, and environment. These challenges highlight the need for trans￾formative policies and practices in Auckland, exploring alternative approaches to 
urban water supply to maximise resource effciency.
Most of Auckland’s properties are connected to the Watercare wastewater piped 
network. According to Watercare’s wastewater collection reports, they collect 
approximately 410 million litres of wastewater each day and send it to treatment. 
The Auckland region has around 7999 km of wastewater pipes and 18 treatment 
plants (Watercare 2021). Watercare plans to invest $8.26 billion over the next 
20  years to accommodate a 26% increase in population and meet the growing 
demand for water and wastewater. Additionally, Watercare is investing approxi￾mately $10.2 billion in renewing and upgrading current infrastructure assets in 
operation. Although Watercare’s key policy directions recognise the beneft and 
value of reducing waste, circular approaches have not been suffciently showcased 
in practice. There is no mention of using utilities or services to become circular, 
which is crucial to building resilient and water-secure cities.
14.4.4 Auckland Water Strategy 2022 2050
The Auckland Water Strategy (our water future) is a 30-year guide for the Auckland 
Council on the management and use of water in the region and is developed in rec￾ognition of the Auckland Plan 2050 and Auckland’s Climate Plan. It aims to ensure 
the mauri (life-sustaining capacity) of water as fundamental intuition and encapsu￾lates fve values of ecosystems, water use, recreation and amenity, culture and resil￾ience for water. As the Auckland Water Strategy outlines, it aims to develop its 
connection to be a reliable and sustainable supply of water for the region, while also 
protecting the environment and promoting the effcient use of water resources.
The Auckland Water Strategy is a vital document that seeks to protect and 
improve the life-sustaining capacity of water by embracing te mauri o te wai. 
However, one of its key limitations is that it does not address the issue of circular 
water management, which focuses on the reuse of water resources to reduce waste 
and increase effciency. To this end, the strategy promotes the use of innovative 
technologies and practices, such as rainwater harvesting and water conservation 
measures, to reduce water demand and improve effciency. It also proposes a dual 
benchmarking approach, which combines water sensitive cities and a Mātauranga 
Māori Framework to measure ongoing action. This approach aims to ensure that 
water is used sustainably, effciently, and responsibly, while also meeting the needs 
of the region’s growing population.
However, the water strategy does not adequately demonstrate a paradigm shift 
towards wastewater reuse, where water entering and leaving urban pipe networks 
gradually decreases over time, thus reducing the overall demand for water. Therefore, 
appropriate policy and strategy changes are needed to fully implement circular 
water management in the Auckland region.

14.4.5 Te Tāruke-ā-Tāwhiri: Auckland’s Climate Plan
The Auckland Climate Plan is designed primarily as a roadmap for the city to 
achieve zero emissions. The plan includes integrated actions to implement circular 
and regenerative approaches to address waste, such as construction and demolition, 
household, plastic and paper waste, as well as developing a low carbon econ￾omy (Auckland Council 2020). Although the plan mentions support for increasing 
resilience in the water cycle by introducing circular water systems, there is a lack of 
directive actions to explain how this potential can be realised. However, Action Area 
B2 of the climate plan mentions delivering stormwater solutions and water-sensitive 
design as an action area for planning and designing infrastructure  (Auckland 
Council 2020).
Under the climate plan, actions and targets have been introduced for buildings, 
energy, transport, waste, industrial processes, agriculture, and land use sectors to 
achieve decarbonisation pathways for Auckland from 2030 to 2050. Although the 
plan prioritises setting targets and action plans to achieve decarbonisation, the 
author believes that these sectors have not explicitly incorporated water circularity 
through actions or pathways to meet climate goals.
14.5 Results and Discussions
After examining the current approaches to water resources management in the 
Auckland region, it is clear that water infrastructure in the region prioritises the use, 
take, and waste of water, rather than focusing on process management. The author’s 
review of water-related planning and statutory instruments in the Auckland region 
reveals that the region has not adopted a central approach to the implementation of 
three water infrastructures. Although the council intends to develop and enable 
these water infrastructures to maximise opportunities for low-impact urban design 
and amenity outcomes, moving away from conventional narrow grey infrastructure, 
it is evident from this review that Auckland needs to move away from the current 
linear water management approach.
14.5.1 Challenges and Missed Opportunities that Hinder WSD 
and NbS for Circular Urban Management 
in the Auckland Region
The author’s review of regional, local and technical guidelines and policy instru￾ments related to planning and water resource management has shown how these 
policy documents contribute to circular management and the challenges and missed 
opportunities of water management in the Auckland region. The author has made 
several observations relevant to these issues, which could potentially hinder the 
circular economy transition. These observations are summarised in Table 14.2.
14 Water Sensitive Design and Nature-Based Solutions for the Circular Management…252
Table 14.2 Challenges of implementing WSD and NbS for circular management of urban water 
through the current planning policy in Auckland
Challenges Evidence and opportunities
Balance of water demand and 
availability
The review indicates that Auckland benefts from a variety of 
water sources and has suffcient water supplies to meet current 
demand. However, it highlights the lack of emphasis on 
managing the growing demand for water while also ensuring a 
stable and reliable supply. Auckland’s population is increasing, 
and demand for water is rising alongside challenges related to 
climate change, including extreme weather events. Watercare 
and Auckland council have a critical role to play in managing 
demand and availability while ensuring supply stability.
The review notes that planning policies have recognised these 
challenges and highlighted the need to manage availability 
through drought preparedness, water management actions, and 
operational responses. However, as climate conditions change 
and economic constraints come into play, maintaining stability 
and managing user expectations becomes more challenging. To 
balance demand and availability, measures are necessary to 
encourage water conservation and effciency planning, including 
incentives for water-effcient appliances.
Watercare reports that only a quarter of Aucklanders with 
gardens collect rainwater, indicating the need to promote the use 
of rainwater harvesting systems to build drought resilience. In 
addition, measures are essential to improve the reliability of the 
city’s water supply, including increasing the capacity of water 
treatment plants while restoring mauri (the vital essence).
The building of capacities for communities to live without the 
pronounced impacts of drought and extreme weather events is 
also necessary. Achieving this requires a coordinated response 
from CCOs and provisions aimed at developing alternative 
water sources, such as desalination
Challenge in balancing the 
need for stakeholder interests 
in implementing WSD and NbS 
outcome of urban development
One of the main challenges identifed in implementing WSD, 
NbS and other processes into new construction or master 
planning projects is fnding a balance between the interests of 
different stakeholders. This involves balancing the needs of the 
natural environment with those of urban development. For 
example, this can be diffcult when the national urban 
development planning and policy framework is ambiguous and 
can create tension, especially when there is a need to protect 
natural habitats while also responding to the growing demand 
for new housing and infrastructure projects (New Zealand 
Infrastructure Commission 2022). This can lead to an increase 
in waste generation and a lack of consideration of cities as 
systems as the urban sector continues to grow.
To achieve circularity, it is necessary to replace the neoclassical 
view of treating water-based infrastructures as models for 
economic growth and commodities with a knowledge-based 
approach to development. This will help stimulate the 
development process, leading to more sustainable economic 
prosperity and development.

Challenges Evidence and opportunities
Limited awareness of 
integrating new opportunities 
for sustainable design through 
WSD or NbS outcomes to 
promote circularity and uptake 
their benefts
In today’s world, with issues such as climate change, water 
scarcity, and pollution, sustainable design has become a crucial 
aspect of environmental conservation. One of the key 
components of sustainable design is WSD, which integrates 
NbS into the planning process to create a more sustainable 
environment. However, the management and operation of water 
resources play an important role as climate conditions change. 
However, the promotion of innovative approaches to transform 
the way water infrastructure is delivered has been slow and 
sporadic in the Auckland planning context.
Although communities, including professionals, acknowledge 
the advantages of WSD and NbS, such as reducing fooding and 
pollution, improving water quality and enhancing the overall 
aesthetic appeal of development, they seem to overlook the 
potential opportunities for water circularity, such as the reuse of 
wastewater and sediments. Furthermore, regulatory and policy 
barriers that make it diffcult to implement NbS and WSD 
measures in the Auckland region can lead to potential resistance 
or scepticism from stakeholders.
One of the main challenges is that existing policies have weaker 
directions towards the inclusion of WSD and NbS in the 
planning process for existing developments in the Auckland 
region. This results in a loss of opportunities to improve water 
management and sustainability in these areas.
Another challenge could be that decision-makers and the 
general public lack knowledge and understanding of circular 
water management practices. Communities may not understand 
the benefts of greywater and rainwater harvesting and may not 
know how to implement these practices at home. This lack of 
understanding makes it diffcult to promote and encourage these 
practices.
Barriers in investing water 
circularity initiatives and 
solutions for water 
conservation and supply due 
to lack of funding and 
resources
Public perception of the high economic costs associated with 
the implementation of WSD and NbS for water circularity has 
signifcantly challenged the planning process. The lack of 
funding and resources for WSD and NbS makes it diffcult to 
implement circularity ideas (Ira & Batstone 2019). This issue is 
particularly prominent for small, low-resourced, economically 
deprived communities and suburbs in the Auckland region, 
which may not have the resources to invest in water circularity 
initiatives.
It is important to recognise that WSD and NbS can provide 
signifcant long-term benefts, such as reduced operational costs 
and environmental benefts. By investing in WSD and NbS for 
water circularity, communities can improve their resilience to 
climate change and reduce their vulnerability to water scarcity 
and pollution. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage decision￾makers, policymakers, and communities to recognise the value 
of WSD and NbS and invest in them accordingly.

Challenges Evidence and opportunities
Regulatory barriers and 
challenges, including limited 
infrastructure to the 
implementation of greywater 
reuse
One of the main challenges in implementing circular water 
management in urban areas of Auckland is the lack of 
infrastructure for the reuse of greywater. Greywater, which is 
wastewater generated from baths, showers, and washing 
machines, can be treated and reused for non-potable purposes 
like irrigation. However, most homes in Auckland do not have 
greywater collection and treatment systems in place, making it 
diffcult to reuse this resource. There are also regulatory barriers 
that hinder greywater reuse in Auckland, mainly due to public 
health concerns. Greywater cannot be used for activities that 
have the potential for human contact or contact with stormwater 
drains.
For example, several regulations, including the National 
Environmental Standards, AUP, Building Act 2004, Building 
Regulations 1992, and Building Code, require minimum 
treatment and advanced secondary-level treatment, including an 
appropriate disinfection system, to establish treated wastewater. 
This makes greywater reuse an inaccessible option for most 
households or requires the installation of expensive and 
complex treatment systems before greywater can be reused.
Challenges in planning, 
designing and implementation 
of greywater circularity using 
WSD and NbS practices
Another challenge is the limited funding available to implement 
circular water management practices. The cost of installing 
greywater reuse systems or rainwater harvesting systems may 
not be practicable, as there is suffcient funding available to 
support these projects on a wider scale.
Limited funding and resources can also limit the ability to 
investigate the effectiveness and long-term performance of these 
approaches in the Auckland region and develop new techniques 
and methods. Implementing NbS and WSD measures may be 
more expensive than traditional grey infrastructure approaches, 
which may also be an obstacle in the region.
Limited research and data to 
understand the effectiveness of 
circular water management in 
Auckland
The review of the potential for water circularity noted that there 
may be a shortage of data and research on the effectiveness of 
circular water management practices, particularly for Auckland 
or generally in the wider New Zealand context, which can make 
it diffcult to determine the best methods and technologies to 
use. The lack of information can impede the implementation 
and expansion of these practices. Furthermore, policymakers 
and regulators should encourage the implementation of WSD 
and NbS practices by easing some restrictive regulatory barriers. 
It is also important to identify knowledge gaps and highlight 
areas for improvement, leading to more effective and 
sustainable water management practices in the Auckland region.
Challenges in coordination 
and collaboration between 
agencies and stakeholders:
Due to the complex nature of water management in Auckland, 
coordination and cooperation between various agencies and 
stakeholders are essential. However, the review found that there 
is often a lack of cooperation and coordination, resulting in 
missed opportunities for WSD and NbS to implement solutions 
for water circularity.

I. Jayawardena255
Despite these challenges and missed opportunities outlined in Table 14.2, the 
planning framework in the Auckland region has made signifcant progress in imple￾menting WSD and NbS. For example, the AUP has adopted a WSD approach, which 
involves the restoration of natural habitats, waterways, and the integration of natural 
habitats into the built environment. Furthermore, in 2022, Auckland Council took a 
major step towards sustainable water practices by amending the AUP. The change 
eliminated the need for planning approval when installing rainwater tanks for reuse 
purposes in most residential and rural properties in Auckland. This amendment aims 
to encourage rainwater harvesting and reduce the dependency on potable water by 
eliminating regulatory barriers.
One of the other key observations is to understand that WSD practices can 
encompass more than just managing stormwater. Auckland needs to explore a wider 
range of potential for extending the application of WSD towards other types of 
water infrastructure, namely wastewater and drinking water, as well as taking into 
account circularity, and socio-cultural well-being factors.
14.5.2 What Does the Region Require for the Transition 
to Circular Water Management?
Table 14.1 highlights several challenges and missed opportunities for circular water 
management in the Auckland region. Addressing these challenges requires a combi￾nation of education and outreach, policy changes, and investment in research and 
development. Specifcally, there is a need to better understand the benefts and costs 
of reusing all materials in water, in addition to stormwater treatment and discharge. 
Effective implementation of WSD practices also requires a deeper understanding of 
their potential benefts.
The management of stormwater runoff is an important challenge to urban water 
in the Auckland region. The increased volumes of stormwater runoff can cause 
fooding, erosion, and pollution of waterways. Furthermore, industrial and urban 
areas can lead to contamination of the water source. Given climate change is also a 
concern, the region requires adopting best-practise strategies to deliver WSD and 
NbS that could boost water circularity.
Another challenge is the management of wastewater. The region’s ageing sewage 
infrastructure is inadequate to meet the needs of the growing population, and in 
need of repair or replacement to support more sustainable and circular-economic￾based wastewater treatment systems. Treatment effuents and treatment and waste 
produced from treatment are considered to be the core basic need for transforming 
to circular water management. Investment in circular water management can realise 
the potential for savings of operation cost as the region is under pressure to reduce 
its reliance on traditional wastewater treatment methods, which can be energy￾intensive and environmentally damaging.
14 Water Sensitive Design and Nature-Based Solutions for the Circular Management…256
The use of alternative water sources, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater 
reuse, to reduce the strain on traditional water supplies and improve water effciency 
is also an opportunity for the region. Retroftting new technologies around water 
recycling within urban development is also important. However, a lack of infra￾structure and incentives and regulations limit the use of these alternative sources, 
making the linear approach to water management the norm. Periodic droughts further 
exacerbate the issue and result in water shortages and restrictions on water use.
Promoting the use of rainwater harvesting and encouraging effcient water use 
are crucial in the Auckland Region. These measures aim to reduce water demand 
and protect water resources. Rainwater harvesting involves collecting and storing 
rainwater for later use and can be a cost-effective and sustainable way of managing 
water resources. Treating and reusing greywater can reduce the demand for potable 
water resources and improve water effciency. Greywater, which is water that has 
been used for washing, bathing or laundry, can be treated and reused for irrigation, 
fushing of toilets, and other non-drinking purposes. However, the use of these 
methods within the development and planning industry is currently limited due to 
regulatory barriers, lack of infrastructure, and lack of awareness among the public. 
These barriers also limit their use in the region. By investing in circular water 
management practices, such as the use of alternative water sources, improving 
infrastructure, and implementing new technologies, barriers to effcient water man￾agement in the Auckland region can be converted into opportunities for sustainable 
and cost-effective solutions.
14.6 Conclusion
This chapter discussed the importance of rethinking urban water management sys￾tems through the lens of the circular economy and how this approach could become 
increasingly necessary due to factors such as urban growth, population growth, and 
impacts of climate change. In particular, the chapter focuses on the use of WSD and 
NbS to manage urban water in Auckland. The chapter evaluates the current mecha￾nisms for implementing WSD and NbS practices in Auckland to assess the chal￾lenges and missed opportunities of circular management of urban water. The author 
used a case study approach that involved a review of planning and policy instru￾ments related to the control, protect, manage and delivery of urban water practices, 
including documents from Auckland Council and Watercare to emphasise and 
refect many of the existing and proposed initiatives associated with the circular 
water economy. The chapter aims to contribute to the identifcation of challenges 
and missed opportunities for circular management of urban water through WSD and 
NbS practices in the Auckland region.
The review of water-related planning and statutory instruments in the Auckland 
region indicates that there is a lack of a centralised approach to implementing water 
infrastructure. While Auckland intended to develop a low-impact water infrastruc￾ture to move away from conventional grey infrastructure, there is still a need to 
I. Jayawardena257
change the current perception of linear water management. The review highlighted 
several challenges and missed opportunities for water management in the region, 
including the lack of emphasis on balancing water demand and availability, chal￾lenges in balancing stakeholder interests, limited direction and awareness of WSD 
and NbS, lack of funding and resources, and regulatory barriers. These barriers 
make it diffcult to implement circular management of urban water in the Auckland 
region. There is also potential resistance or scepticism from stakeholders due to the 
unfamiliarity with circular approaches to water management, including regulatory 
and policy barriers that make it diffcult to implement NbS and WSD measures in 
the Auckland region.

Wetlands as a Nature-based Solution 
for Urban Water Management
Harsh Ganapathi, Suchita Awasthi, and Preethi Vasudevan
Abstract Cities occupy less than 2% of the Earth’s surface, but more than half of 
the world’s population resides in them. As per the United Nations Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), the urban population is expected to 
increase to around 7% thereby increasing pressure on these areas and the resources 
therein. Urban areas are among the signicant contributors to climate change and 
where the impact on natural resources is the most experienced, particularly water 
resources. Major cities of the world are experiencing water scarcity. Climate change 
has altered the water cycle, causing increased ooding and prolonged droughts. The 
impacts of climate change, compounded with increasing urbanisation, inadequate 
management and governance, have resulted in urban water-related issues such as 
water resources degradation due to contamination, lack of wastewater treatment, 
groundwater depletion, and water-related disasters. Given the uncertainty of the 
climate and existing capacities to meet the demands of rapid urbanisation, the tradi￾tional grey infrastructure is no longer sustainable.
Combining grey infrastructure with nature-based solutions, such as wetlands, 
therefore, offers a sustainable and resilient approach to managing urban water 
resources. These hybrid approaches not only contribute towards efcient and effec￾tive water resources management but also provide a buffer from the impacts of 
extreme events and ecosystem services, contributing to improved health of urban 
dwellers. Recently, hybrid approaches of integrating nature-based solutions with 
grey infrastructure have been gaining prominence worldwide. A number of global 
cities have drifted towards these integrated approaches, including Copenhagen, San 
Francisco, Seattle, and Singapore. Given the varied ecosystem services and values 
they offer to society, wetlands form the core of its ecological and economic security. 
Their contribution towards environmental and resource sustainability has now 
gained recognition. For example, the city of Columbia in Sri Lanka has integrated 
wetlands into the city’s ood defence system while providing co-benets such as

enhanced urban and peri-urban agriculture. The lack of studies on the role of wet￾lands as a nature-based solution and inadequate governance framework has not only 
ignored the role of wetlands in urban water management but also led to the rapid 
decline of this fragile ecosystem. Amidst the rapidly increasing climate crisis, it is 
pertinent to integrate wetlands through a multi-stakeholder and inter-sectoral col￾laboration and mainstream wetlands into urban planning and administration. This 
chapter explores the role of wetlands as a nature-based solution in urban water man￾agement through a case study approach and suggests a framework for mainstream￾ing wetlands conservation and management in developmental plans and programmes 
for vertical upscaling.

15.1 Introduction
The world is reeling under rapid urbanisation. As per the population fgures pub￾lished by the United Nations, the world’s urban population has increased from 30% 
in 1950 to 55% in 2018. By 2050, the population residing in urban areas is projected 
to increase to 68%, with 90% of the rise in the population being concentrated in 
Asia and Africa (Fig. 15.1) (UN 2019). This rapid increase has added tremendous 
pressures on the environment and the communities within, leading to land use 
changes, loss of biodiversity, water, air and noise pollution, increased GHG emis￾sions, urban heat island effect, fragmentation of natural habitats, large-scale dis￾placement and migration, inadequate public infrastructure and housing (Theodorou 
2022; Li et al. 2022; World Bank 2021).
Kookana et al. (2020) assessed the key impacts of urbanisation on water resources 
in terms of water scarcity, surface and groundwater depletion and water contamina￾tion. Their analysis states that cities such as Mexico City, Mexico; Sao Paulo, 
Brazil; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Nairobi, Kenya; Istanbul, Turkey; Sana’a, Yemen; 
Fig. 15.1 Urban population projection by 2050. (Source: UN 2019)
H. Ganapathi et al.261
Karachi, Pakistan; Kabul, Islamabad; Bengaluru, India and Beijing, China are 
among the most water-scarce cities across the globe. This can be attributed to over￾exploitation of surface and groundwaters, particularly in Indian cities such as 
Bengaluru, Delhi, and Chennai, among others. Degradation of surface and ground￾water water quality has been observed in cities in Asia, Africa and Latin America 
(Fig.  15.2) (Kookana et  al. 2020; Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2016). Globally, the 
urban population facing water scarcity is expected to increase by 81–154.4% by 
2050, compared to 2016, with 840 million facing perennial and 1.225 billion facing 
seasonal water scarcity. In India alone, the projections estimate an increase from 
222 million people in 2016 to 550 million people affected by water scarcity by 2050 
(Fig.  15.3) (He et  al. 2021). The impacts of climate change, compounded with 
increasing urbanisation, inadequate management and governance, can be attributed 
to the increasing water issues across urban areas globally.
Several cities suffered severe water crises in the last decade, such as Sao Paolo in 
Brazil in 2015, Barcelona in Spain in 2016, Cape Town in South Africa from 
2017–2019 and Chennai in India in 2019–2020. In Cape Town, the dam levels 
dropped to 20% in November 2017 (Millington and Scheba 2021); in Sao Paolo, the 
city’s main reservoir level was below 17% (Visser 2018). The case of Chennai has 
been a signifcant call for attention at the international level for the water crisis and 
its impacts. The South Indian City, surrounded by numerous wetlands and receives 
140 cm rainfall annually, had all its four reservoirs dried in June 2019, declaring a 
‘Day Zero’. The drinking water was transported from other locations (Biswas et al. 
2022; Tripathy and Raha 2019). While the city faced an extreme water crisis due to 
prolonged dry spells and heat waves, the situation was exacerbated due to rapid 
expansion at the cost of the city’s natural resources. Chennai has experienced rapid 
loss in the wetlands due to encroachment and dumping of garbage and the release 
of untreated wastewater. Sikarwar and Chattopadhyay state that, known as the city

of thousand lakes, Chennai has lost over 60% of its wetlands (2020) in the last fve 
decades. Increase in the impervious infrastructure has led to reduced groundwater 
recharge as compared to its over-extraction to meet the water demands of the city 
(Kalia 2020; Kookana et al. 2020).
Increasing impacts of climate change compounded with increasing urbanisation 
are the major factors contributing to urban water-related issues, including water 
quality deterioration due to contamination, lack of wastewater treatment, ground￾water depletion, and water-related disasters. Given the uncertainty of the climate 
and existing capacities to meet the demands of rapid urbanisation, the traditional 
grey infrastructure is no longer sustainable. Combining grey infrastructure with 
nature-based solutions, such as wetlands, offers a sustainable and resilient approach 
to managing urban water resources. These hybrid approaches not only contribute 
towards effcient and effective water resources management but also provide a buf￾fer from the impacts of extreme events and ecosystem services, contributing to 
H. Ganapathi et al.263
improved health of urban dwellers. The International Union for Conservation of 
Nature (IUCN) defnes nature-based solutions (NbS) as “actions to protect, sustain￾ably manage, and restore natural and modifed ecosystems that address societal 
challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously benefting people and nature”. 
These actions address challenges such as climate change, disaster risk, food and 
water insecurity, and biodiversity loss, among others, at relatively low costs. The 
three main types of NbS are a) Solutions for enhancing existing natural or protected 
ecosystems, b) Solutions based on developing sustainable management protocols 
and procedures for managed or restored ecosystems, and c) Solutions that involve 
creating new ecosystems. NbS is an umbrella concept encompassing ecosystem 
approaches such as ecosystem restoration approaches, ecosystem-based adaptation, 
ecosystem-based mitigation, ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction, natural infra￾structure, green infrastructure, integrated coastal zone management, integrated 
water resources management and area-based conservation approaches, including 
protected area management (Cohen-Shacham et al. 2016a, b).
NbS interventions for managing water resources in urban areas include protect￾ing and managing the natural ecosystem, restoring and sustainably managing 
wetlands, conserving forests, restoring drylands, developing green infrastructure, 
incorporating green and blue infrastructure in urban areas, natural coastal infra￾structure (Seddon et al. 2020; Stefanakis et al. 2021). Recently, hybrid approaches 
of integrating nature-based solutions with grey infrastructure have been gaining 
prominence worldwide. Given the varied ecosystem services and values they offer 
to society, wetlands form the core of its ecological and economic security. Their 
contribution towards environmental and resource sustainability has now gained 
recognition. For example, the city of Columbia in Sri Lanka has integrated wetlands 
into the city’s food defence system while providing co-benefts such as enhanced 
urban and peri-urban agriculture. The lack of studies on the role of wetlands as a 
nature-based solution and inadequate governance framework has not only ignored 
the role of wetlands in urban water management but also led to the rapid decline of 
these fragile ecosystems. Amidst the rapidly increasing climate crisis, it is pertinent 
to integrate wetlands through multi-stakeholder and inter-sectoral collaboration and 
mainstream wetlands into urban planning and administration. This chapter explores 
the role of wetlands as the nature-based solution in urban water management and 
suggests a framework for mainstreaming wetlands in developmental plans and 
programmes for upscaling.
15.2 Nature-based Solutions for Urban Water Management
The urban landscape is an interconnected system. The rapid increase in urban sprawl 
modifes the local hydrology and climate, thereby intensifying hydrometeorological 
hazards like water scarcity, urban heat, foods and droughts (World Bank 2021). 
This leads to space constraints for implementing large-scale NbS within the built-up 
environment. A combination of blue-green and grey infrastructure enables the city 
15 Wetlands as a Nature-based Solution for Urban Water Management264
to thrive amidst the rising need for water management. This section explains how 
the NbS creates a conducive ecosystem to manage water supply, moderate water 
quality and buffer extreme climate events. The various types of NbS explained here￾after can effectively be implemented for urban water management under different 
requirements.
NbS for urban water management should ideally be considered at a level of spa￾tial scale. For example, interventions at the river basin or the catchment scale would 
enable foodplain restoration that re-establishes natural hydraulic and hydrological 
connectivity for managing food hazards (Kumwimba et al. 2023). At the same time, 
site-level interventions like bioswales can be planned with the urban areas facing 
issues related to fooding. Urban areas can also be located in mountainous regions, 
foodplains, deltas and coastal areas, each facing a different kind of water manage￾ment problem. For example, a mountain city would need NbS suited to tackle fash 
foods from intense rainfall, whereas a coastal city would need solutions for hazards 
like seawater intrusion (World Bank 2021).
Some of the NbS at the catchment scale include restoration of forest cover in 
upland areas to intercept and reduce stormwater velocity, rehabilitation of food￾plains to enhance surface water and groundwater storage and reduce food risks in 
downstream areas, restoration of mangroves in coastal cities to buffer coastal storms 
surges. At a city scale, NbS include urban forests and terracing to delay runoffs, the 
creation of constructed wetlands to treat and store urban runoff, the renaturation of 
drainage lines in the city, and enhanced rainwater harvesting structures. NbS in 
semiarid areas where the rainfall is scanty, solutions should focus on water storage 
and rejuvenating traditional groundwater water harvesting systems to avoid evapo￾ration from the surface.
Small streams and drainage channels provide a wide range of benefts to communi￾ties, such as nutrient and pollution removal, groundwater recharge, and food mitiga￾tion. In some urban areas, drainages are enclosed by concrete pipes or simply flled in. 
Stream daylighting is a technique to remove layers of concrete and recreate the natural 
shape and dynamic of streams, resulting in increased wildlife and aquatic habitat and 
better-regulated stormwater runoff treatment and intake (Eisenberg and Polcher 
2020). In urban areas, bioswales and rain gardens are also constructed (Addo-Bankas 
et al. 2022). These are shallow, densely vegetated ground depressions with various 
plant species to collect stormwater from adjacent impervious surfaces. During storms, 
they become fooded and facilitate ground infltration and cleaning of stormwater 
simultaneously (EPA 2006). Permeable pavements are also some of the alternatives to 
traditional concrete pavements. They offer a higher infltration capacity and reduce 
runoff. They generally consist of a surface pavement layer, an underlying stone aggre￾gate reservoir layer, and a flter layer or fabric installed at the bottom (LIDC 2007).
Detention ponds and retention ponds are used for water storage. Detention ponds 
are more profound and less biologically diverse bioretention areas than bioswales. 
These bioretention systems capture and temporally store stormwater during periods 
of heavy rain (Eisenberg and Polcher 2020). Detention ponds can completely fll up 
with water during storms; they infltrate much of it into the ground; and discharge 
the overfow into the sewer system. Retention ponds are bio-retention areas that are 
the permanent body of water and vegetated edges. They are usually permanently 
H. Ganapathi et al.265
flled with water and collect stormwater from the surrounding areas, add storage 
capacity and ease the pressure on the surface water treatment and sewerage treat￾ment systems. Retention ponds offer the added beneft of storing water for further 
reuse during drought conditions while providing habitat and enriching the diversity 
of public green spaces (Iwaszuk et  al. 2019). Along with retention ponds, con￾structed wetlands are also used as treatment wetlands. Constructed wetland is an 
integrated wastewater treatment system consisting of water, plants, animals, micro￾organisms and the environment. These are the human-made wetlands in which com￾ponents are manipulated to treat water quality. These wetlands are designed to 
simulate natural processes to improve water quality (Stefanakis 2019). Constructed 
wetland is an alternative facility for wastewater treatment with the advantage of 
being low-cost and easy to operate and maintain (Gholipour and Stefanakis 2021). 
The system uses water, vascular plants like reeds, and duckweeds, non-vascular 
plants like algae, a flter bed of soil, sand and gravel and naturally occurring micro￾organisms (Manual on Constructed Wetland as an Alternative Technology for 
Sewage Management in India, 2019).
Floating wetlands are effective in situ wastewater treatment technology based on 
nature’s self-cleaning capacity (Jana 2011). They are widely espoused for treating 
agricultural runoff, stormwater, and industrial effuents in urban areas (Munazzam 
et  al. 2018) and are relatively low-cost water reclamation schemes (Jana 2011). 
Floating wetlands usually have a suspended matrix planted with wetland plants. 
Nutrients and potentially toxic metal(s)/element(s) are taken up from the wastewa￾ter by plants through their roots, whereas organic matter is degraded by the micro￾organism forming bioflms on the roots and mat surface (Munazzam et al. 2018). 
Prevailing contaminated wetlands, rivers, canals, and ponds in urban areas can be 
treated with foating wetlands (Ghaballah et al. 2021). Secondary benefts of foat￾ing wetlands also include water cooling and habitat for biodiversity (Kennen and 
Kirkwood 2015).
The People’s Republic of China established the ‘sponge city’ concept in 2014. 
The concept was developed to use ‘blue’ and ‘green’ spaces in the urban environ￾ment for stormwater management and control (Chan et al. 2018). ‘Sponge cities’ are 
urban areas with copious nature infrastructure such as trees, wetlands, lakes and 
parks and/or other grey infrastructure intended to absorb rainwater, attenuate peak 
run-off, purify urban runoff and conserve water. The practices related to sponge cit￾ies will enhance natural ecosystems and provide a better ambience for people living 
and working in urban areas and improve the habitat for biodiversity. Currently, 
diverse urban areas in China, the USA and the UK embrace the concept of a sponge 
city as NbS through inner-city gardens with wetlands, improved river drainage and 
plant-edged sidewalks.
Implementing the aforementioned NbS at different spatial scale levels requires 
assessing the landscape functions, benefts reaped by the NbS used, costs, and suit￾ability considerations of NbS.  The assessment is followed by an analysis of the 
application of the NbS in the urban landscape, like reduction of a food, water 
storage, water purifcation, etc., followed by a multistakeholder and interdisciplinary 
approach which requires a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and cross-sectoral 
approach. A shift from fragmented siloed planning of urban interventions towards a

systems-planning approach to achieve urban water management while effciently 
using the available resources is required.
To understand the usage of NbS worldwide, case studies from 17 countries were 
chosen from 16 manuscripts. These case studies were pertaining to 10 key benefts, 
namely increasing groundwater table, increasing surface water storage, improving 
water quality, improving habitats for faunal species, improving surface water con￾nectivity, mitigation of foods, re-establishing traditional water systems, addressing 
climate change impacts, securing drinking and domestic water and aquaculture pro￾tection were mapped as shown in Fig. 15.4. It was noticed that the NbS were primar￾ily used to address groundwater depletion, water storage and water quality, followed 
by mitigation measures for climate change impacts. Some of the NbS interventions 
implemented in various parts of the world are presented in the section below.
15.2.1 Jinan, China: Sponge City
Jinan, the capital of Shandong province located in the middle east of China, is one 
of the pilot sites for the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of 
the People’s Republic of China’s Sponge City initiative (SPC), announced in 2015. 
H. Ganapathi et al.267
The city is also called the Spring City due to multiple karst springs. Since the 1970s, 
increased groundwater abstraction and concretisation of the city have contributed to 
reduced fow or, in some cases, completely dried-up springs. It also faces water 
shortages due to uneven rainfall and urban fooding. River fooding in the Xiaoqing 
River and fash fooding in the streets are common occurrences in the city due to the 
topography and location (Li et al. 2016).
The SPC in Jinan is focused on stormwater storage and infltration. The frst step 
of the pilot is to improve the stormwater drainage for food control. Subsequent 
steps include dredging the Xiaoqing River to improve carrying capacity, building 
LID facilities to increase stormwater infltration and protecting the water supply of 
the springs, and preventing surface water quality degradation through interception 
and purifcation.
Song et al. (2020) estimated the effects of a sponge city in Jinan on stormwater 
quality through the Infoworks ICM model. They report that Jinan’s annual total 
rainfall volume capture ratio is 77.4%, and the rainfall-infltration conversion rate 
has increased from 30% to 73.3%. The high-risk fooding area was reduced by more 
than 50%. Xu and Liu (2019) report that the sponge city construction was benefcial 
for augmenting the groundwater level in Jinan, leading to increased spring discharge.
15.2.2 South Los Angeles Wetland Park, Los Angeles, 
California, United States: Constructed Wetland
South Los Angeles Wetland Park, located within the Los Angeles river catchment, 
captures and treats urban stormwater run-off through a wetland system with a marsh 
habitat in the centre. In 2011, a former bus yard at the centre of a densely populated 
community was converted into a constructed wetland and park. The project was 
envisioned for stormwater quality improvement to satisfy the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to prevent water pollution and remove con￾taminants from waterways (Shannon and Hood 2016).
The urban runoff from the 212.5 ha catchment area is routed from the existing 
pipeline to a constructed wetland system of 7596 sq. m. Forty species of open￾water, emergent marsh, riparian and upland plants that are both food and drought￾resistant are used throughout the wetland. Wetland species include sandbar willows, 
California bulrush, tall fatsedge, yerba mansa, California rose, hummingbird sage, 
mulefat, and coast live oak. The constructed wetland can treat up to 52,995 L of 
stormwater per day. The constructed wetland removes 100% of oil and grease, 75% 
of bacteria, 96% of TSS, 41% of nitrate, and 34% of phosphorous from the runoff. 
Treated water is delivered back to the traditional stormwater system at the western 
side of the site. The park provides recreation and serves as a community place with 
trails, broad walks, picnic areas, and educational signages.

15.2.3 Hauz Khas, Delhi, India: Wastewater Reuse
Hauz Khas in Delhi, India, is an artifcial lake built in 1295 by the then-ruler of Siri 
(one of the seven cities of Delhi) Sultan Allauddin Khilji. The lake spans up to 
585.15 ha with an average depth of 2.2 m. Excessive land use changes in the catch￾ment and diversion of stormwater drain caused the lake to dry up in the 1960s. 
Another contributing factor is also the receding water table levels from excessive 
extraction.
In 2003, the Delhi Development Authority and Indian National Trust for Art and 
Cultural Heritage (INTACH) proposed reviving the lake using treated sewage water, 
and the implementation work started in 2003. Treated wastewater from a nearby 
Sewage Treatment Plant in Kishan Garh was diverted to two lagoons, followed by 
a series of retention ponds for further treatment. The lagoons used duckweeds, 
and the retention ponds were flled with aquatic plants such as water hyacinths. 
This process further breaks down organic matter, improving water quality.
The treated water fows through a pipeline to the Hauz Khas lake through the 
gravity fow technique. Fishes and aeration of the lake help prevent algal growth, 
mosquitos, and water stagnation. Since the start of operation in April 2004, the lake was 
stabilised by the end of 2006 and currently provides various services. Continuous 
availability of water in the lake has improved the water table level in the region, with 
an aquifer recharge of over 1800 million L till 2021 (250  days water supply of 
Delhi) (Bhatnagar 2021). The lake attracts various migratory birds such as shovel￾ers, coots, common pochards, mallards, greylag geese, kingfshers, cormorants, and 
pied herons. Braj Foundation is responsible for the continued maintenance of 
the lake.
15.2.4 Sydney Park, Sydney, Australia: Stormwater Reuse
Sydney Park, located in St Peters, Sydney, Australia, was redesigned in 2015 to act 
as a large-scale stormwater treatment system following the principles of Water 
Sensitive Urban Design (WUSD) and capturing and treating run-off from the Munni 
channel catchment of 203 ha. The park provides recreation and capture and treat￾ment of 850 million litres of stormwater annually, enabling reuse. The project is an 
integral component of the City of Sydney’s Sustainable Sydney 2030, which aims 
to replace 30% of 2030 potable water demand across the local government area. The 
project was built through the National Urban Water and Desalination Plan.
The system was conceived as a series of connected wetlands, cascades, spill￾ways, and sculptural elements incorporating nature-based solutions. A main drain￾age pipe carrying the run-off is fed into the naturalised system. The gross pollutants 
are removed using traps, and bioretention is carried out using elevated beds of 
grasses and reeds that flter sediments and heavy metals. Water is then released into 
the wetland before being used around the park for irrigation, watering, truck wash￾ing, and fushing. The process of moving water from bioretention to wetland is 
H. Ganapathi et al.269
repeated through the wetlands using various interventions like cascading ponds. 
The design also incorporates footbridges, informal paths, and stepping stones allow￾ing people to explore and discover the various treatment processes.
The project has enabled the capture and reuse of stormwater which otherwise 
would have drained into the Alexandra canal. The local biodiversity has also 
improved, with the wetland hosting the highest population of native bird species in 
the local area, including 22 wetland species (Sydney Park Water re-use project n.d.).
NbS for urban water management provides several co-benefts for biodiversity 
and human well-being such as increasing the aesthetic value of the place, improving 
health and quality of life and creating several green jobs (Cohen-Shacham et al. 
2016a, b). Implementing NbS also requires stakeholder groups to address economic, 
political and scientifc challenges simultaneously (Maes and Jacobs 2017). The 
practitioners from several sectors need to consider the elements of urban water man￾agement and co-benefting actors such as urban management, wildlife, innovation 
and governance within a socio-ecological system (Maes and Jacobs 2017; McGinnis 
and Ostrom 2014). This also allows an integrated approach for diverse types of 
systems, knowledge and values to design and implement the required NbS so that it 
is socially coherent and acceptable to a wide range of stakeholders (Frantzeskaki 
and Kabisch 2016; Maes and Jacobs 2017; Raymond et al. 2017).
15.3 Mainstreaming Wetlands as NbS to Address Urban 
Water Issues
Wetlands are among the world’s most productive ecosystems. Owing to the myriad 
values and benefts that they offer, they are essential for ensuring water and food 
security as well as ensuring human well-being. With rapid urbanisation, an increase 
in water demand has created more water infrastructure for supply. As a result, natu￾ral water systems like wetlands were less acknowledged and lost relevance. With 
access to piped water supply and easy extracting groundwater, more than half of the 
urban population depends on groundwater as the major water source. Cities and 
wetlands have had organic connections. With increased encroachment, their ability 
to provide food, fltration and food control is compromised. Built infrastructure has 
taken over the once wetlands’ areas, leading to fragmentation of the hydrological 
connectivity between the water storage structures, rendering them dysfunctional 
and reducing the ecological services they provide. Wetlands have invariably been 
treated as wastelands. Several cities have their waste dump sites located within wet￾lands. This seriously affects the urban water quantity and quality while also impact￾ing biodiversity and increasing risks of droughts and foods. Amidst increasing 
climatic uncertainties and the failure of grey infrastructure in managing urban water 
woes, it is pertinent to integrate wetlands as nature-based solutions in urban devel￾opment. The key factors governing the mainstreaming of wetlands are presented in 
Fig. 15.5. The key enablers for mainstreaming wetlands in urban development are 
listed in the section below.
15 Wetlands as a Nature-based Solution for Urban Water Management270
Fig. 15.5 Key factors governing the mainstreaming of wetlands to address urban water issues
A. Inter-sectoral Collaboration
Restoring and rejuvenating wetlands to address urban water issues require col￾laborative planning and implementation at the landscape scale. Thus, integrating 
NbS in urban planning for water management required an in-disciplinary, collab￾orative and inter-sectoral approach. The collaboration entails bringing together 
stakeholders across various sectors that have infuenced or are infuenced by wet￾lands. An extensive coordination mechanism needs to be built to include concerned 
line departments such as forest, biodiversity, and disaster management, from identi￾fying appropriate NbS, location suitability, and implementation. This would also 
help assess the synergies, co-benefts and trade-offs in implementing wetlands as 
nature-based solutions.
B. Inclusion and Participation
The implementation of the nature-based solution, particularly wetlands, is car￾ried out at a local scale. Therefore, the local urban community is one of the key 
stakeholders for such interventions, rather than just the benefciaries. It is essential 
to foster local partnerships and ensure their engagement, from scoping and planning 
to implementation and monitoring of NbS. Such partnerships, adhering to gender 
and social equity norms, will not only help in addressing the conficts which may 
arise between the various resource users but also inculcate a sense of ownership to 
ensure the long-term sustainability of the intervention.
C. Building Evidence Base
Mainstreaming wetlands as nature-based solutions for water management 
requires context-specifc information on the implementation approach and potential 
co-benefts. The available success stories, experiences and challenges in integrating 
wetlands as nature-based solutions are scattered. To ensure the scalability of such 
interventions, there is a need to strengthen the evidence base by synthesising the 
knowledge generated through demonstration projects in varied geographical and 
socio-economical contexts. A mechanism to share learnings through tangible dem￾onstrations, research and traditional knowledge is, therefore, necessary to facilitate 
the uptake of wetlands as NbS for water management. This continuous sharing of 
H. Ganapathi et al.271
learnings, challenges, and success stories helps build the capacities of the stakehold￾ers entrusted with implementing such interventions. Multiple projects are being 
implemented at the local levels by non-governmental organisations; engaging with 
these organisations will also strengthen the knowledge base with an improved 
understanding of the ground realities, context specifcities and suitability of the 
interventions.
D. Mobilise Investment
The investment decisions for integrating wetlands in urban planning need to 
account for the multiple benefts that these ecosystem offers, such as water secu￾rity, improved water quality, enhanced biodiversity, buffer to foods, improved 
urban aesthetics, and micro-climatic regulations. Siloed approaches for imple￾menting such interventions would lead to fnancial defcits and impact their long￾term sustainability. It is, therefore, pertinent to identify convergence opportunities 
to generate investments. Wetlands as NbS can be integrated into sectoral plans and 
programmes that aim at urban development, such as food management, climate 
action plans, city development plans, and water resource management plans. 
Engagement with private sector actors with shared interests in addressing urban 
water issues will help mobilise investments to co-fund the NbS interventions. 
Alternative fnancial instruments such as municipal bonds, operations and manage￾ment costs, and value capture fnancing offer additional access to funds to imple￾ment the interventions.
E. Robust Monitoring
A robust monitoring system to assess the progress of the interventions and sug￾gest mid-term corrections are essential to ensure the effective delivery of the ben￾efts of wetlands to the urban environment and the communities within. Defning 
and collecting data are key performance indicators to assess the project’s progress. 
It also helps review the assumptions and actions at critical intervals to assess the 
validity and suitability of actions. Regular monitoring is also essential for the 
effective utilisation of fnancial resources and improved effciency of human 
resources. Building the capacities of the local stakeholders, such as the citizen 
stewards, will help a systematic data collection and comparison of the actual out￾comes against the objectives designed during the inception of the interventions.
15.4 Conclusion
The global economy is powered by urban areas. More than half of the global popu￾lation now resides in these areas. Rapid urbanisation in the face of climate change 
has brought tremendous pressure on urban natural resources. World’s major cities 
are now facing a severe water crisis in terms of quality and quantity. Owing to 
the lack of infrastructure capacities in the urban areas, grey infrastructure alone 
would not be able to ensure water security. It is, therefore, the need of the hour to 
integrate nature-based solutions in urban development. These ecosystem-based 
15 Wetlands as a Nature-based Solution for Urban Water Management272
interventions provide multiple co-benefts, thus providing a holistic solution 
towards water management needs. Wetlands – the ecosystems located at the inter￾face of land and water, through their myriad services and values, have been recog￾nised as cost-effective nature-based solutions. Halting their degradation, ensuring 
the conservation and developing constructed wetlands have a substantial impact on 
recharging groundwater and ensuring surface water availability. Even though 
nature-based solutions are a buzzword in the global arena, their scalability is still a 
challenge. This can be attributed to the lack of knowledge base, capacities, success 
and failure stories and appropriate institutional mechanisms for stakeholder 
engagements and coordination. An enabling condition that varied engaging sectors, 
developing knowledge-sharing platforms and ensuring local participation can help 
address these challenges. A regular monitoring system for mid-course corrections 
and leveraging alternative fnancial opportunities will ensure the long-term sustain￾ability of these measures and the realisation of co-benefts for the well-being of 
urban dwellers.

Evidences in Hydrodynamic Behavior 
Along a Float Treatment Wetland (FTW) 
on a Tropical Urban Stream
Rodrigo Bahia Pereira, Vinícius Neves Urbanek, Johannes Gerson Janzen, 
and Fernando Jorge Corrêa Magalhães Filho
Abstract Floating Treatment Islands (FTIs) or Floating Treatment Wetland (FTW) 
are nature-based solutions to improve water quality and have been implemented in 
lentic and lotic ecosystems. The water treatment process occurs by a biolm devel￾oped along the plant’s root zone, thus enabling the adsorption of components such 
as nitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals, and suspended solids. The efciency of an 
FTW system can be understood as a function of hydraulic retention time (HRT), 
water depth, the cultivated biomass, and the species of the plant. Studies carried out 
in laboratory and computer modeling describe the behavior of the uid in the root 
zone and suggest optimal conditions to the FTW implementation, such as the num￾ber of FTW required, their distance, and dimensions to increase water treatment 
efciency. However, physical and computational models generally consider a rigid 
behavior of the root zone, unlike the real conditions of plant roots that show move￾ments along their extension caused by the stresses exerted by the uid. This consid￾eration can lead to differences between the behavior of physical and computational 
models developed under these conditions to a real physical model emplaced in a 
natural environment. Understanding the hydrodynamics of FTW systems is critical 
to measuring the positive impacts on aquatic ecosystems and the economics of

The results of this pilot project were positive in relation to the theoretical descrip￾tions. The water velocity through the root zone showed an average reduction above 
60%. Along the length of the FTW, the capture of suspended sediments was related 
to the root zone mass of Pistia stratiotes (r2
 = 0.5). However, there was no progres￾sive reduction in the amount of solid mass captured, which may be associated with 
the non-uniformity of root biomass along the FTW and fuid behavior. As a way of 
complementing the experiments carried out in the laboratory and computer model￾ing, the real-scale experiments in an urban stream bring us hydrodynamics data and 
suspended sediment mass reduction in a pilot project of FTW, which may contribute 
to the improvement of hydrodynamic models.

16.1 Introduction
Urbanization often leads to a decline in the water quality of rivers and streams as a 
result of increased runoff and wastewater from drainage areas. To address this and 
other water quality issues, modern environmental technologies such as Floating 
Treatment Wetlands (FTWs), also known as Floating Treatment Islands, can be 
employed in these bodies of water.
FTWs are composed of vegetation that is anchored to a foating matrix, such as 
a foam mattress or hydroponic medium, on the surface of the water. This creates 
vegetated areas that resemble vegetation islands. The roots of the plants extend 
through the water column, providing a large surface area for bioflm growth and the 
removal of fne suspended solids, such as dissolved contaminants and nutrients, 
through physical and biochemical processes.
Several studies have demonstrated the capacity of FTWs to remove suspended 
particles, nutrients, and heavy metals from water (Colares et al. 2020). For example, 
the work of De Stefani et al. (2011) found that after FTW treatment, chemical oxy￾gen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) decreased by 66% and 
52%, respectively. Additionally, Nichols et al. (2016) presented results showing a 
removal of 80% of total suspended solids (TSS), 53% of total phosphorus (TP), and 
12% of total nitrogen (TN).
Despite the fact that the Floating Treatment Wetlands (FTWs) have been exten￾sively studied for their ability to remove pollutants from water bodies, the majority 
of research has focused on the treatment performance achieved by different vegeta￾tion species, or analyzing biological, physical, or chemical factors affecting their 
performance, without considering the infuence of hydrodynamics on the removal 
of pollutants. According to Colares et  al. (2020), factors such as water depth, 
hydraulic retention time, cultivated biomass, and plant species must be evaluated in 
order to fully understand the potential of FTWs in treating water.
R. B. Pereira et al.279
In recent years, there have been a growing number of studies that have begun to 
investigate the effects of hydrodynamics on the mass removal performance of 
FTWs. Studies by Downing-Kunz and Stacey (2012), Xavier et al. (2018), and Yu 
et al. (2019) all highlight the potential impact of parameters such as the hydraulic 
residence time within the radicular zone and the mass fow rate of contaminants and 
nutrients reaching the root zone of FTWs over water treatment. These variables are 
crucial in determining the effectiveness of FTWs in removing pollutants. The longer 
the pollutants remain within the FTW’s root zone, the greater the removal will be.
Additionally, the hydrodynamics will dictate the mass fow rate supplied to the 
radicular zone. As the mass infow rate tends to zero, even if the residence time of 
water inside the FTW is high, the mass removed by the root zone will approach 
zero, since no mass is entering the radicular zone. Liu et al. (2019) were one of the 
frst to attempt to link FTW hydrodynamics with mass removal in open channels, 
building on the results obtained by Xavier et al. (2018) in retention ponds with FTWs.
Studies on the effects of hydrodynamics on FTWs, like those mentioned above, 
have primarily been conducted in the laboratory or through computational model￾ing, leaving a gap in knowledge about the performance of FTWs in natural environ￾ments. To address this gap in knowledge, feld studies are needed to investigate the 
hydrodynamics of FTWs in real-world settings. In this study, velocity measure￾ments were taken around and within an FTW system located in a stream in the city 
of Campo Grande-MS. A laboratory analysis of the FTW sediment retention was 
also performed, to estimate its capacity of fltering suspended solids from water. The 
main goal of this study was to assess the hydraulic behavior and treatment potential 
of a Floating Treatment Wetland system in a real-world, tropical urban watershed.
16.2 Materials and Methods
16.2.1 Location
The experiments were conducted at Reveilleau Creek in Campo Grande, Brazil 
(Fig. 16.1). The Reveilleau Creek basin has an area of approximately 1.24 km2
. The 
section chosen for the experiments is located within an urban park known as Parque 
das Nações Indígenas, which is surrounded by large and medium-sized trees and 
grass, providing food and shelter for various animal species. Despite the presence of 
the park, the area is also near an urban area with heavy traffc, leading to a high 
quantity of sediments and nutrients being transported to the water bodies. The creek 
fows into a large artifcial lake that acts as a retention basin for rainwater. At the 
location of the experiments, the stream has a width of 5.0 m and an average depth 
of 0.3  m. The fow velocity upstream of the Floating Treatment Wetlands was 
approximately 5.6 cm/s, corresponding to a Reynolds Number of 18,000, indicating 
a turbulent fow condition.

16.2.2 Experimental Design
The construction of the FTW involved using bamboo with an average diameter of 
0.15 m to form a structure with a longitudinal length of 3.35 m and a transversal 
length of 4.2  m. The bamboos were linked together using cut fttings and wires 
(Fig. 16.2a). To keep the vegetation in place during the experiment, a polyethylene 
mesh, divided into squares with 0.05 m on the edges, was wrapped around the bam￾boo structure, forming two parallel islands along the structure with a small corridor 
of 0.2 m wide between them (Fig. 16.2b). This confguration was chosen because it 
has been shown to optimize mass removal (Xavier et  al. 2018). The FTW was 
anchored in place using steel cables (Fig. 16.2c and vegetation was “planted” on the 
FTW to form two islands, with dimensions of 1.26 × 2.3 m and 1.21 × 2.3 m.
The vegetation used for the experiment was the species Pistia stratiotes, com￾monly known as “water lettuce”. This plant species is characterized by increasing 
microbial activity, absorbing nutrients, and removing suspended solids from aquatic 
environments (Sidek et al. 2018). Plant root lengths used in the experiment varied in 
a range from 0.14 to 0.30 m and were randomly allocated on the polyethylene mesh 
(Fig. 16.2d).

16.2.3 Field Measurements
After the installation of the FTW, a period of 14 days was waited for the plants to 
acclimate to the new water conditions and become healthy enough to perform the 
water treatment accordingly. Velocity was measured using an Acoustic Doppler 
Velocimeter (SonTek MicroADV 16 Hz, YSI, USA). The primary fow direction, x, 
was defned as x = 0 and x = L at the upstream and downstream ends of the FTW, 
respectively; the transversal direction, y, with y = 0 and y = W at the right and left 
sides of the channel, respectively; and the vertical direction, z, with z = 0 and z = H
at the surface and at the bottom of the channel, respectively. The corresponding 
components of the velocity vectors were V(x,y,z) = u, v, and w.

Measurements were carried out at 25 different points, approximately half depth, 
for 2  min at 50  Hz. To measure the velocity inside the FTW, some plants were 
moved from their original positions to avoid interference and recording errors dur￾ing velocity measurements. Common post-processing techniques such as despiking 
and denoising were employed to process the data, using the following criteria to 
evaluate data quality: any correlation must be greater than 70% and signal-to-noise 
ratio should be greater than 15 dB. Data that did not meet these criteria was removed. 
For each velocity measurement, average velocity components (u, v, and w) were

Fig. 16.3.
(a) The data collection took place from upstream to downstream to prevent causing 
disturbances in the fuid that could increase uncertainty during measurements.
(b) Cross-sections were determined using a measuring tape to record the distance 
of the recording points from the left and right margins, as well as their distance 
from the bamboo structure.
(c) The measurement point depth was determined using the rod used to fx the 
MicroADV.
(d) The collection was carried out over fve cross-sections: one downstream of 
the FTW, three sections within the FTW through the length of the bamboo 
structure, and one fnal section upstream of the FTW.  In each cross-section,

fve collection points were used: one point on each side outside the bamboo 
structure, one point inside each FTW, and one more point in the corridor 
between both FTWs.
Table 16.1 presents the depths of each ADV measurement along the FTW, as 
well as the root length at each collection point.
16.2.4 Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)
The particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a widely used technique for measuring the 
vectorial magnitude of physical phenomena by analyzing the movement of particles 
in sequential images (Raffel et al. 2007). The focus of this specifc experiment was 
to utilize the PIV technique to investigate the fuid behavior in the presence of roots 
in an underwater environment. To accomplish this task, the processing of the 
acquired images was performed using the PIVlab software, a Matlab application 
well-suited for our case requirements.

However, in order to obtain accurate results, it is essential to take certain precau￾tions when processing the images, to avoid producing incorrect data (Thielicke and 
Stamhuis 2014). Factors such as low contrast, excessive noise, impurities in the 
fuid, and non-homogeneous lighting can all negatively impact the accuracy of the 
PIV results (Conevski et al. 2019; Senatore et al. 2013). To address these issues, 
pre-processing algorithms such as Contrast-limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization 
(CLAHE) and intensity capping were employed to enhance the contrast of the 
images and suppress particles with high luminous intensity values. The images were 
captured at a high frame rate of 60 fps and a resolution of 4 K, and a total of 1800 
frames were recorded continuously, positioned parallel to the fow, were used for 
the PIV processing.
16.2.5 Sediment Quantifcation
To obtain data on the mass of suspended sediments that are adsorbed by the roots of 
the water lettuce, at the initial moment of the experiment, when the plants were 
being allocated at the foating bamboo structure, all of the roots of the plants were 
carefully rinsed with running water, with the aim to remove any kind of remaining 
solid material, to guarantee that, at the moment of the laboratorial analysis, we 
could safely consider that every sediment found was coming from Reveilleau Creek.
After the allocation of the FTWs at the stream, a 15-day time span was waited 
until the collection of some plant samples to perform the quantifcation of retained 
sediment within the roots. To perform sample selection, FTWs were divided into 
three distinct areas, the upstream portion being named island’s front (IF), the inter￾mediate region being named island’s middle (IM), and the downstream section of 
the FTW being named island’s end (IE). This was done to better describe the behav￾ior of suspended sediment retention along the length of the FTWs. A total of 12 
plant individuals were took from the system, collected in a random way, being 2 
samples from each part of each island. Plants were individually preserved inside 
glass containers (Becker).
Roots of each selected specimen of Pistia stratiotes were washed with distilled 
water, generating a mixture of water and sediments. The samples were agitated suf￾fciently until they became homogeneous and then a representative volume of 
100 mL was taken for vacuum fltration and separation of the sediments contained 
in the mixture. Subsequently the flters were dried in an oven at 105 °C and weighed, 
resulting in the values of mass of sediments retained in each analyzed root.
To estimate the total of suspended solids captured by the Floating Treatment 
Wetland system, the average value of the mass of captured solids among the 12 
analyzed plants was considered, and then multiplied by the total number of 200 units 
of Pistia stratiotes.

16.3 Results and Discussion
16.3.1 Hydrodynamic Behavior
It is known that FTW are good solutions to reduce the concentration of physical and 
chemical parameters of water quality and, for being a biologic and solely dependent 
on the maintenance of vegetation in aquatic environment, it becomes potentially 
accessible at its implementation and operation. A number of published studies 
describe the potential that some plant species have for the removal of phosphorus, 
potassium, nitrogen, and even heavy metals, in lentic environments and computa￾tional modeling (Coetzee et al. 2020; Gaballah et al. 2019; Sidek et al. 2018; Victor 
et al. 2016). However, we could not nd any research studies performed in lotic 
environments employing Pistia stratiotes, considering eld measuring data.
This experiment was carried out aiming the construction and implantation of a 
single FTW on an urbanized stream. Both the external structure of the island as the 
plants utilized were obtained from natural environments. The only materials 
required for the construction of the FTW that had a monetary cost were the polyeth￾ylene mesh, which was used to individually allocate each plant specimen, and the 
steel wire cables, which were used for anchoring the system in place. The cost of 
building the FTW was estimated to be around $2.00 per m2
.
When it comes to the hydrodynamics of the FTW, it was observed that it had a 
signicant impact on the local ow dynamics by diverting a portion of the ow 
around it (as depicted in Fig. 16.4). Research from the literature has shown that the

fow velocity immediately decreases at the upstream edge of FTWs (Yamasaki et al. 
2021). As the velocity decreased when approaching the FTW, a region with high 
negative vertical velocity could be observed at the lower upstream edge of the FTW 
(Downing-Kunz and Stacey 2012).
A portion of the fow penetrated the FTW, since it is a porous region. Inside the 
root zone, the fow slowed down due to drag, reaching velocities ranging up to 
0.3  U0. Flow velocity inside the radicular zone, UR, varied between 1.7 and 
6.6 cm/s, which is compared to the velocity ranges found in other studies (Billore 
et  al. 2009; Bu and Xu 2013; Downing-Kunz and Stacey 2012). The estimated 
hydraulic residence time (T = L/UR) within the root zone was less than 1.5 min.
As the water fow deviated from the FTWs, the velocity within them decreased, 
leading to an increase in velocity in the areas between the FTWs and between the 
FTWs and the stream margins. This trend of increasing velocity with longitudinal 
distance between the FTWs and between the FTWs and the stream margins suggests 
that the water fow continues to deviate away from the FTWs, resulting in low 
velocities downstream of the FTWs. The results of the experiment did not present 
any regions of negative velocity downstream of the FTWs. This is in line with previ￾ous studies that have found that vegetation patches with low fow blockage values 
do not present recirculation zones downstream (Chen et al. 2012).
Another aspect to be evaluated was if the vertical velocity profle presents decel￾eration through the roots, since part of the fow has presented a tendency to deviate 
to the sides between the FTW and the margins of the stream. According to Li et al. 
(2019) and Li and Katul (2020), the velocity of water below the root zone increases 
the shear stress, which can generate “short-circuiting” in the treatment system and/
or increase diffusivity, causing contaminants located at deeper depths to reach the 
region of bioflm. The vertical velocity profle has presented higher magnitude 
velocities below the roots, being found values up to 10 times superior to those in the 
middle of the root zone (Fig. 16.5).
Liu et al. (2019) have shown that, for small values of kT (<0,1, with k being the 
frst-order decay rate constant inside the radicular zone), the fraction of mass 
removed by a single FTW is M = kL/U0. Apparently, there are no studies measuring 
k under feld conditions. Nevertheless, considering a value of k equal to 1 day-1, 
Fig. 16.5 Particle image velocimetry vertical velocity profle
R. B. Pereira et al.287
the value of kT for the present study would be smaller than 0.1, and it would be 
necessary an FTW over 2.4 km long to remove 50% of the mass. On the other hand, 
if kT ≥ 5, then the majority of the mass entering the FTW (over 99% of the infow) 
is removed and the fraction of mass removed is UR/U0 (U0 = 5.6 cm/s), which in 
our case could be as low as 31%.
16.3.2 Entrapped Sediments
The experiment was carried out during the rainy season, which provided optimal 
conditions for the transportation of sediment from the watershed to the drainage 
system. As a result, the concentration of suspended solids at Reveilleau Creek was 
increased. During the course of the experiment, from FTW implantation to data col￾lection, no maintenance services or new plant additions were made to the Floating 
Treatment Wetland (FTW) system, and it was only impacted by the natural varia￾tions that occurred in the watershed over a 15-day period.
Based on the data presented in Table 16.2, it was found that the physical charac￾teristics of the plants along the length of the FTW did not follow a linear distribution 
factor, which could be a contributing factor to the average capacity of the FTW to 
adsorb suspended solids.
The mass of sediment captured by Pistia stratiotes varied from 0.12 g per plant 
to 1.87 g per plant, with an average value of 0.85 g per plant. Although there is lim￾ited scientifc research on the amount of suspended material adsorbed by Pistia 
stratiotes, a study conducted by McAndrew et  al. (2016) found values ranging 
between 0.89 g per plant and 1.44 g per plant for the species Alisma and Carex, 
respectively. This suggests that the results obtained in our experiment can be

considered representative of the species’ capacity. Additionally, it was estimated 
that the FTW captured a total of 168 g of suspended solids over the 15-day period.
Sediment adsorption by roots is a function of multiple variables such as length, 
volume, root density, hydraulic retention time, and suspended solid characteristics, 
among others. Combined with the physical characteristics of FTW, with time it 
tends to have its particle adsorption capacity reduced due to the accumulation of 
solids in the bioflm. Thus, at a time tn, the mass of captured suspended solids sta￾bilizes. Despite the understanding of the real adsorption capacities of FTW being 
complex due to presenting several intervenient variables to the process, at the end of 
15 days of experiment, it was found an acceptable correlation between the captured 
mass of solids and the mass of the plant roots (Fig. 16.6).
The data obtained and analyzed have shown that the hydrodynamic behavior and 
adsorption of suspended solids are coherent with research already developed. The 
measured velocities have presented a reduction of up to 68.8% between the average 
measured upstream and downstream values. Velocity reduction was a crucial factor 
to elevate the hydraulic detention time within the radicular zone, thus potentializing 
the adsorption of suspended solids by roots, which resulted in an average adsorbed 
value equal to 0.89 g/plant.
Besides the main functionality of reducing the concentrations of pollutants and 
increasing of water quality at the stream, another observed result was an alteration 
on local aquatic fauna. Through the 15-day period of the experiment, it was observed 
that new specimen of small fsh species had come to the FTW looking for food and 
habitat, besides the already existing fauna of the area of the study. Furthermore, 
after the occurrence of a rainfall event, it was found that the FTW had also worked 
as a means of containing the advance of large pollutants through the stream, such as 
urban waste, plastics, organic matter, and metal objects.

16.3.3 Implications of the Study
Despite the FTW being remained installed for about 30 days, it was possible to 
observe its effciency and durability in an urban stream during a rainy period. Plant 
allocation happened 5 days after the installation of the bamboo structure and, during 
that period, it retained organic matter such as tree leaves and small twigs, as well as 
solid residuals from anthropic activities, such as PET bottles and polystyrene, 
among others (Fig. 16.7). Before the allocation of plants, the whole structure was 
cleaned to ensure that there was no additional pre-established matter in the FTW.
In the frst days after the allocation of plants, some heavy rain events have caused 
damage and loss of Pistia stratiotes specimen, plus an excess of organic matter at 
the structure and below, which led to another maintenance service to be carried out 
to make possible that the experiments proceed (Fig. 16.8).
The polyethylene mesh was reinforced with a base of wire cables, to give a more 
robust support for intense rain events. Thus, new plant specimens were added to the 
FTW system, and another period of time has been waited for the plants to adapt to 
the new environment (Fig. 16.9).
The frst velocity measurements were then carried out as described in previous 
sections. In the following days, a rain event with a high magnitude has overloaded 
the FTW with organic matter and urban solid residuals, as shown in Fig. 16.10.
Despite the challenges and diffculties found, the velocity measurements and 
quantitative analysis of suspended solids captured by the roots have shown that the 
system had functionality for the hydraulic conditions in which it has been inserted, 
with 30 cm depth and fow velocity of 5.6 cm/s, outside the rainy season. Furthermore, 
it was possible to clearly notice changes in habitat diversity at local fauna,

16.4 Conclusions
A low-cost pilot experiment was carried out, with raw material with near-zero eco￾nomic cost associated, showing promising results. It was identifed that the system 
of Floating Treatment Wetlands can be functional and feasible for an effcient 
removal of suspended solids in an urbanized stream. The plant species Pistia stra￾tiotes presented values of captured sediments within a range from 0.12 g per plant 
to 1.87 g per plant, and an average value of 0.85 g per plant, which is actually con￾sistent with results from other studies testing different plant species. Hydrodynamic 
analysis was also useful to give some insights into the behavior of fow within an 
FTW system, which can be further explored to assess more precise parameters for 
the design and dimensioning of this kind of environmental technology. The fow 
velocity decrease generated by the presence of an FTW is crucial to improve the 
retention time of water within the root zone of these systems, and its hydraulics 
needs to be well comprehended to facilitate the development of effcient project 
parameters to ensure good water treatment. Besides the assessment of the hydraulic 
behavior and sediment retention capacity of the FTW system, it also presented a 
good impact over the local ecological diversity, serving as habitat and providing

food for local fsh species. However, to provide a stronger and reliable practical 
framework for stablishing guidelines and design parameters for the construction 
and operation of FTWs in urban streams, the continuity of the experiment is needed 
for a longer period of time. Therefore, the following topics are suggested:
1. Continuous evaluation of the parameters of water quality along the hydrological 
year, upstream and downstream of the FTWs to compare with existing computa￾tional models.
2. Hydraulic modeling of the streams to identify suitable places to install FTW 
systems avoiding damage to the FTW structure.
3. Detailed analysis of root density and hydraulic retention time for several fow 
conditions associated with root reconfguration and its porosity.
4. Development of a good practices manual for FTW installation and maintenance.

Abstract This chapter aims to present data and reect on the trajectory and current 
conditions of urban water management in Brazil, focusing on sustainable stormwa￾ter drainage and the possibility of expanding sustainable design, planning, and 
nancing practices, mainly through nature-based solutions (NbS). The authors 
emphasize the importance of transitioning investments toward the integration of 
nature-based solutions in urban drainage initiatives comprising the set of urban pub￾lic policies. The research uses data from important databases in Brazil, such as the 
Brazilian National System for Water and Sanitation Data (SNIS), the Integrated 
Planning and Budget System (SIOP), and the National Basic Sanitation Plan 
(Plansab). The work also presents a conceptual and historical discussion about the 
types of urban drainage systems and actions in Brazil. Another highlight of the text 
is the discussion on challenges to change the historical preference of traditional 
(conventional) solutions in urban stormwater management usually predominant in 
Brazil and many other countries in the world. The current debate demands changes 
in favor of preventive and sustainable actions integrated into other urban policies.

17.1 Introduction
For many years, in different countries, in addition to the low implementation of 
planned urban drainage systems, the existing systems were designed based on the 
hydraulic effciency of the system and the quantitative control of stormwater. In 
general, this conventional approach disregards, or places in the background, the 
control of water quality in river and urban lakes, the safeguard of public health, and 
the groundwater recharge processes. As a result, future interventions are necessary, 
causing inconvenience to the population, risk of disease, loss of life, and environ￾mental and economic damage.
Infrastructures that fully convey stormwater, usually through pipes, with high 
installation and maintenance costs, distance themselves from the “new” perspective 
of urban drainage (Chapa et al. 2020). One of the explanations for these models still 
being practiced is to give cities a healthier or more hygienic appearance, through the 
rapid disposal of effuents.
Technical issues such as soil sealing and the consequent increase in surface run￾off, the absence of good plans and urban projects, the defcit of decent housing 
(housing on hills, riverbanks, precarious situations), and the lack of attention to 
disasters are currently gaining greater appeal, highlighting the importance of urban 
drainage systems. It is in this context that sustainable infrastructure theses gain 
ground: they propose the adoption of technologies, engineering works, and manage￾ment and monitoring systems that have nature and the natural fows of water as the 
basis for designing solutions.
In this sense, Shao et al. (2021) consider that Brazil follows the world trend of 
interest in the theme of management with a sustainable focus on water resources, 
with theoretical and conceptual articles, manuals, projects, modeling studies, and 
case studies that share national and international experiences with potential for sup￾port sustainable water management strategies.
Currently, many Brazilian municipalities have incorporated into their legislation 
the encouragement, and even the obligation, in some cases, to adopt sustainable 
techniques for managing stormwater. Although they are a minority in the total num￾ber of municipalities, such actions are important and may indicate the beginning of 
an important transition toward the implementation of solutions that consider the 
fow of nature and that integrate elements of the watershed in their projects.
This chapter aims to present data and refect on the trajectory and current condi￾tions of urban water management in Brazil, with a focus on sustainable drainage of 
stormwater. The possibility of expanding sustainable design practices, planning, and 
fnancing in the sector is discussed, mainly with focus on nature-based solutions (NbS).
The structure of the text consists of seven sections, including this introduction. 
The second section is a brief review of the evolution of urban drainage management. 
Then, in the third section, the authors compared the costs of conventional and sus￾tainable drainage projects expressed in a set of literature. The fourth section pres￾ents the trajectory of urban drainage in Brazil. The ffth section presents a quantitative 
overview of drainage with nature-based solutions (NbS) in Brazilian municipalities. 
A. T. Mendes et al.297
The sixth section presents a discussion about the challenges, barriers, and opportu￾nities for NbS deployment in Brazil. Finally, the last section brings the fnal 
considerations.
17.2 Urban Stormwater Drainage: Modern and Sustainable 
Management Models
The new perception of urban water management was strengthened in the 1990s, 
when elements of natural drainage systems (e.g., the watershed soil and vegetation) 
began to be considered more frequently in stormwater control projects (Souza et al. 
2012). This approach has evolved and incorporated different terminologies around 
the world: Low Impact Development (LID), usually in the United States and New 
Zealand (Dietz 2007; Eckart et  al. 2017; Liu et  al. 2021); the Australian model 
Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) (Hoban 2019; Radcliffe 2019; Wong 2006), 
and the British model Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) (Ferrans et al. 2022; 
Gimenez-Maranges et al. 2020; Jones and Macdonald 2007).
As this approach evolves, in theory and in practice, they receive other terminolo￾gies (Christofdis et al. 2020; Fletcher et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018). Despite the differ￾ences in concept and scope, in essence, they are terminologies that fundamentally 
converge towards the transition (and/or incorporation) of conventional solutions to 
techniques of low environmental impact for the control and management of storm￾water (Gimenez-Maranges et al. 2020; Goulden et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2019).
For this reason, it is common for these approaches to be generally recognized as 
sustainable, since, in many aspects, the systems conceived under this paradigm offer 
functionalities that go beyond those typically provided by conventional systems 
(Fletcher et al. 2015; Rosa et al. 2019; Sørup et al. 2019). Table 17.1 presents some 
examples of these functionalities referred as proposal of the sustainable stormwater 
management (last column).
Table 17.1 also summarizes the main stormwater management models illustrat￾ing their terminologies, their probable origin (period and region), and their proposals.
As can be seen, the use of these models seeks to meet other important hydraulic 
functions, such as: contributing to restore the natural hydrological cycle, improving 
the recharge of underground aquifers, increasing atmospheric humidity, and reduc￾ing surface runoff. Therefore, the potential benefts are many: reduction of heat 
islands, reduction of food risks, improvement of the urban landscape, and, mainly, 
greater availability of water for supply near consumption centers (Morgan and 
Fenner 2019).
These sustainable approaches do not necessarily replace conventional ones, but 
increase the range of options available to the planner and designer of drainage sys￾tems; and, in many cases, complement existing traditional systems forming hybrid 
systems (Arik 2022; Cousins 2017; Mguni 2015; Porse 2013; Rentachintala 
et al. 2022).

However, the implementation of sustainable measures depends on local capac￾ity (engineering, fnancial, institutional). Some components of the sustainable 
stormwater infrastructure require high levels of maintenance costs and integration 
between stormwater and urban planning institutions resulting in obstacles to their 
implementation. As mentioned by Porse (2013), in the early years of the twenty￾frst century, while more developed cities with more consolidated drainage sys￾tems are moving toward the implementation and expansion of sustainable 
infrastructures, smaller cities are looking to expand the coverage of their conven￾tional networks.
A. T. Mendes et al.299
17.3 Economic Analysis of Sustainable Drainage Systems
When comparing investments required by sustainable systems against traditional 
ones in Scotland, Duffy et al. (2008) consider that, when well designed, sustainable 
drainage is more economical to build and maintain than traditional drainage. In 
Brazil, the same conception is presented by Tucci (2005), who adds that sustainable 
drainage projects have a lower fnal cost than conventional ones, even though they 
require greater professional and interdisciplinary qualifcation. The channeling of 
water tends to represent costs 6–10 times greater than the damping of the fow in 
terms of corrective solutions, according to the author.
The reduction of runoff mitigates the need to implement drainage structures, 
enabling the reduction of materials needed for paving roads and sidewalks, for 
installing gutters and networks, thus reducing infrastructure costs (EPA 2007). The 
use of natural water infltration devices is common, in addition to forecasting the 
increase in naturally fooded areas. It is still essential that the houses are not close to 
rivers, or areas susceptible to landslides, fooding, or subject to other risks.
Thus, the closer the stormwater devices are to the source, the more economical 
the system will be (Tucci 2003). In addition, sustainable systems presuppose the 
rationality of urban aspects to provide the most effcient use of space, taking advan￾tage of the characteristics of relief and soil and resulting in the reduction of sur￾face runoff.
The economy resulting from investments in sustainable projects is emphasized in 
studies in different countries. Mendes and dos Santos (2021) gathered around 30 
case studies, developed in seven different countries, where comparisons were made 
of implementation costs between conventional and sustainable urban drainage sys￾tems. The studies gathered in Table  17.2 refer to sustainable systems that, to a 
greater or lesser extent, use NbS.
The data in Table 17.2 show that there is a large reduction in implementation 
costs in sustainable systems compared to conventional ones, except for three out of 
the 30 cases. The large variation in costs between cities is due, in part, to different 
environmental conditions, land occupation and urban infrastructure. But the adop￾tion of sustainable techniques does not always result in projects with lower initial 
costs. In some situations, investments may increase due to the acquisition of plant 
material, site preparation, soil corrections, the need for underground drains, and 
connections to public drainage systems, in addition to increased project manage￾ment (EPA 2007; Yazaki 2021).
An important aspect of the overall economic analysis of sustainable drainage 
system is the valuing of additional benefts resulting from these projects. These 
benefts are usually disregarded due to high level of uncertainties in the available 
methods of economic evaluation of environmental benefts and costs. Not consider￾ing these benefts results in a biased beneft-cost analysis of sustainable drainage 
projects.

Examples of additional benefts resulting from sustainable drainage systems are: 
improving public health; mitigating the impacts of urbanization on the environment, 
especially on water; creating recreational and tourism opportunities; supporting 
local ecology and biodiversity; capturing carbon; and valuing real estate in the 
region (Charlesworth et al. 2017; CIRIA 2019; Davis and Naumann 2017).
These additional benefts can also be monetized, allowing you to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of deploying these infrastructures in other respects. The 
Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) developed a 
free tool (the B£ST – Benefts Estimation Tool), which allows evaluating and mon￾etizing many of the fnancial, social, and environmental benefts of sustainable 
infrastructure listed, helping managers to make decisions and other actors 
(CIRIA 2019).
A case study carried out in Coventry, UK, to demonstrate the multiple benefts of 
Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) found that, in total, the city-wide ben￾efts of adapting SuDS were valued at more than £1.5 billion, in 40 years (CIRIA 
2013). In the study, among the quantifable benefts are the reduction of the overfow 
of sanitary sewer networks, improvement of water quality in rivers, reduction of 
surface water runoff, improvements in air quality, and reduction in energy costs. 
The benefts resulting from improvements such as heat reduction, avoided deaths, 
preservation of biodiversity, and reduction of health expenses were not included in 
the study (CIRIA 2013).
Another important point for the economic analysis is to consider the operation 
and maintenance costs of devices or solutions based on nature. In general, there is 
little or even non-existent information on the costs of operating and maintaining 
17 Trajectory, Challenges, and Opportunities in Sustainable Urban Water…302
these solutions, or there is still a lot of uncertainty in estimating these costs. This 
causes these solutions to be postponed by the public authorities, in favor of more 
well-known and traditional solutions (which generally have low operating and 
maintenance costs).
17.4 Trajectory of Urban Drainage in Brazil
Silveira (1998) points out that the hygienist concept of urban sanitation (quick 
removal of water, mainly through pipes) was consolidated in Brazil in the years fol￾lowing the Proclamation of the Republic, in 1889, because of the urban reforms in 
large cities and the need to clean up urban centers that suffered from epidemics and 
diseases resulting in high mortality rates.
During this period, in many European countries, sanitary and stormwater effu￾ents were transported together, through unitary systems. However, since the second 
half of the twentieth century, the absolute separator system (De Feo et al. 2014) has 
been the model mostly adopted in Brazil.
The option of hygienic models in developing countries followed two scenarios: 
(i) some cities built sewage networks, but avoided drainage networks, resulting in 
reduced domestic pollution and increased fooding; and (ii) cities that built drainage 
networks without a domestic sewage network, jeopardizing water sources due to 
domestic and industrial pollution (Tucci 2012).
There is no precise delimitation of the historical periods that mark the evolution 
of urban drainage in Brazil. Some interpretations, such as Silveira (1998) identify 
three stages: (i) beginning of the construction of drainage infrastructure, a period 
consolidated by the use of hygienist techniques – to minimize the impacts of the 
accelerated growth of large cities such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Recife and 
Belo Horizonte; (ii) the second stage is marked by rationalism and standardization 
of hydrological calculations for dimensioning hydraulic works; (iii) and the third, 
marked by the contact of specialists with techniques and technologies adopted 
abroad, under the infuence of environmental concerns in infrastructures.
Tucci (2005), on the other hand, divides the trajectory and conception of storm￾water drainage into four phases: (i) the frst, pre-hygienist, where there was no con￾trol or treatment of effuents, which were, as a rule, released into the street; (ii) the 
hygienist phase, with the construction of pipelines that transported both sanitary and 
storm effuents; (iii) the corrective phase, marked by the development of the abso￾lute separator system, the treatment of sewage and the damping of stormwater; (iv) 
and the fourth phase, considered as sustainable development, which has been incor￾porating the concern for environmental conservation and quality of life.
The historical trajectory proposed by Christofdis et al. (2020) is different. The 
authors also divided it into three stages: (i) the frst encompasses the frst two stages 
presented by Silveira (1998), referred to as traditional urban drainage, a period in 
which the collection and immediate removal of rainwater predominated; (ii) the 
second, however, is marked by the evolution in the fundamental principles of 
A. T. Mendes et al.303
management and stormwater management, incorporating the use of non-structural 
measures in works and equipment and integrating soil and vegetation in drainage 
projects, a phase that is similar the proposal by Tucci (2005) as sustainable; (iii) and 
the third, as of 2018, would be a new dimension of synergistic interaction between 
cities and water, in which management and handling become centered on the devel￾opment of NbS.
The historical perspective shows that a one-dimensional analysis based only on 
hydraulic aspect of urban drainage is not enough to deal with the problems of urban 
growth and its impacts. According to Miguez et al. (2016), the insistence on main￾taining this conventional view, which only adjusts to increases in runoff volumes, 
forces the government to direct investments in traditional, non-sustainable solu￾tions. The authors point out that a false sense of security is reproduced, especially 
in view of the current scenario of increased frequency and magnitude of extreme 
rainfall events.
Table 17.3 summarizes the different phases of urban drainage in Brazil based on 
the work of Silveira (1998), Tucci (2005), and Christofdis et al. (2020).
Regardless of which path is most consistent with different Brazilian regional 
realities, one of the current paradigms of stormwater management in Brazil is the 
change in constructive philosophy from exclusively traditional drainage systems to 
more sustainable models. Furthermore, although historical classifcation is impor￾tant, Miguez et al. (2016) point out that the evolutionary phases of urban drainage 
were not static. Due to local specifcities, they may have happened simultaneously 
or even varied in the same city, according to different projects of sectors or 
neighborhoods.
According to Miguez et al. (2016), the persistent choice based on conventional 
philosophy, which only adjusts to increases in runoff volumes, forces the govern￾ment to invest in traditional and non-sustainable solutions. Because of this condi￾tion, a false sense of security is reproduced, especially in view of the current scenario 
of increased frequency and magnitude of extreme rainfall events (Myhre et al. 2019; 
Tabari 2020).
In this sense, Brazil followed, at the end of the 1990s, the evolution of other 
countries during the hygienist phase, however it was unable to advance satisfacto￾rily to the following phases Silveira (1998). More than a decade later, Tucci (2012) 
pointed out that most Brazilian cities were still in the hygienist phase and that a 
small number of cities, such as Porto Alegre, Brasília, Campo Grande and São 
Paulo, were transitioning to sustainable.

17.5 Nature-Based Solutions in Brazil: 
A Quantitative Analysis
The Brazilian National System for Water and Sanitation Data (SNIS) is an informa￾tion system administered by the National Sanitation Secretariat, linked to the fed￾eral government. The SNIS is the most important information system in the 
sanitation sector in Brazil, covering water supply, sewage, urban solid waste, and 
urban rainwater management services (Borges et  al. 2022). In 2015, the SNIS 
started to collect data from urban stormwater services in Brazilian municipalities. 
These data are responsible for subsidizing the elaboration and dissemination of the 
SNIS Diagnosis – Stormwater (SNIS-AP), which presents an overview of the sector 
for the country. The data collected by the SNIS-AP allow the construction of an 
enlarged picture of the drainage and stormwater management services in the coun￾try (Brasil 2020b).
Considering the information in the database SNIS-AP, Brazil has two major cat￾egories of sanitary effuent transport systems: the absolute separator system, in 
which sanitary and stormwater effuents are transported separately; and the unitary 
system, where these effuents are transported in the same pipes.
The SNIS shows us some important data about the two main sanitary effuent 
transport systems: the absolute separator system and the unitary system. In general, 
in urban areas, public roads in Brazil have underground drainage networks. The 
urban drainage systems of most municipalities, regardless of their nature (separa￾tors or unitary), are conventional, that is, structures whose main objective is the 
rapid removal of effuents, transferring the problem to another location. According 
to SNIS, in 2019, the separator system predominates in the country, being present in 
1985 (54.3%) municipalities. In 822 (22.5%) the systems are unitary, and 551 
(15.1%) municipalities declare not having a drainage system, as shown in Fig. 17.1.
Although the absolute separator system predominates in Brazil, it is necessary to 
highlight that the low coverage of sanitary sewage networks, and the proper treat￾ment of these effuents, conceptually conditions separating systems to receive sani￾tary sewage not collected from cities. The service of collection networks in the 
country is 54.1%; however, in the North and Northeast regions this percentage is 
less than 30.0% (12.3% in the North and 28.3% in the Northeast) (Brasil 2020b). 
The treatment rate is even more worrying: only 49.1% of the sewage collected in the 
country is treated (Brasil 2020b). Where do uncollected and untreated effuents go? 
Inevitably to rivers and lakes, directly or indirectly by urban drainage systems.
Only a small portion of municipalities adopt some type of NbS. SNIS data, from 
2019, indicate that, of the 3653 municipalities in the sample, only 566 (15.5%) use 
a certain type of NbS (Brasil 2020b). Natural drainage solutions based on infltra￾tion are the most frequent technic, as shown in Fig. 17.2.
Furthermore, 280 municipalities declared having greenways and 174 registered 
retention and/or detention devices, such as reservoirs, basins, artifcial lakes, or 
retention tanks (Brasil 2020b). It is important to mention that in Brazil, the 
17 Trajectory, Challenges, and Opportunities in Sustainable Urban Water…306
Fig. 17.1 Predominant types of urban drainage systems by municipalities. (Source: Brasil 2020b. 
Elaborated by the authors)
implementation and use of NbS as a complementary solution (at least) for drainage 
in urban areas is still at an early stage.
17.6 What to Expect in the Future: Barriers 
or Opportunities?
In Brazil, the implementation of NbS initiatives for infrastructures has broad sup￾port and convergence with federal and local legislation, for example, Law n° 
6.938/1981 (National Environmental Policy), Law n° 9.433/97 (National Policy of 
Water Resources), Law n° 11.445/2007 (National Sanitation and Basic Sanitation 
Policy) amended by Law n° 14.026/2020, as well as Law n° 12.305/2010 (National 
Policy on Solid Waste).
A. T. Mendes et al.307

the authors)
Specifcally on stormwater drainage, recent legislation has sought to provide 
solutions to reduce the institutional barriers that delay the transition to more sustain￾able management, especially at the municipal level. For example, the National 
Basic Sanitation Plan (Plansab), the main integrated planning instrument for basic 
sanitation in Brazil, encourages the transition from classic planning and investment 
models in sanitation services to sustainable models. In addition, the Plan sought to 
associate the Brazilian basic sanitation goals and strategies with the goals estab￾lished in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Brasil 2019).
Throughout Plansab, priority is given to sustainable solutions for stormwater 
drainage, as summarized in Table 17.4.
Moreover, the federal government maintains fnancial programs to municipali￾ties that are interested in implementing such measures. The Pluriannual Plan (PPA), 
main medium-term budget planning instrument of the federal government, has 
17 Trajectory, Challenges, and Opportunities in Sustainable Urban Water…308
Table 17.4 Phases of the trajectory of urban drainage and its main characteristics in Brazil
Subject Reference in Plansab
Transition to 
sustainable approach
[...] the Plansab revision point out shifting the traditional focus from 
classic planning in basic sanitation, that is based on investments in 
physical works, to structuring measures. On the horizon of the Plan, the 
gradual substitution of efforts for the implementation of structural 
measures for others that strongly value the structuring ones is projected 
(Brasil 2019, p. 21)
Technological matrix 
and sustainable 
management
The technological matrix should guide planning and sectoral policy. 
Planning basic sanitation with a long-term view involves prospecting the 
technological paths that the sector should follow. In this sense, topics 
such as sustainability, integrated management of urban water, ecological 
sanitation, recycling, and the fght against global climate change can be 
evoked as examples (Brasil 2019, p. 30)
Incentive for 
academic research
It is also necessary that academic studies in urban drainage be 
incorporated into management and planning, encouraging the practice 
of sustainable drainage and, consequently, the development of projects 
that go beyond the traditional model of simply channeling stormwater 
and promoting his removal (Brasil 2019, p. 59)
Flood reduction It is expected that the adoption of strategies and actions, preferably 
compensatory and structuring, can reduce the problems arising from 
foods in the proportions established for each macro-region
Gradual transition to 
sustainable 
approaches
For the planning of Plansab programs, a gradual transition between 
structural and structuring measures is projected, starting from a 
historical moment, and going through the inertial, reversal and 
stabilization periods, noting that universalization precedes stabilization 
and is the point of equivalence between structural and structuring 
investments [...] (Brasil 2019, p. 204)
Reconciliation of 
urban expansion with 
pre-urbanization 
conditions
[...] as an example, they may receive incentives and induction solutions 
that value, among other dimensions: [...] the use of stormwater in cities 
and in the countryside; compensatory and fow damping measures for 
the management of stormwater and urban drainage; Structuring 
measures to reconcile urban expansion with the maintenance of original 
fows in watersheds (Brasil 2019, p. 207)

specifc Thematic Programs to encourage and support the adoption of sustainable 
drainage, such as the Risk and Disaster Management PPA’s program, through the 
budgetary action 10SG, which aims to support sustainable urban drainage and 
stormwater management systems in critical municipalities subject to recurrent food 
events (Brasil 2020a).
Thus, in theory, municipalities supported by Federal resources should prioritize 
solutions to reduce, delay, or dampen the runoff of stormwater and rely on educa￾tional measures, and coordination of local actions with preventive planning and 
management (Brasil 2020a). To ensure that actions fnanced with public resources 
are not isolated and that they have been previously planned, with low impact and 
sustainable, it is mandatory that the requesting municipalities present a Stormwater 
Management Plan, whose territorial unit is the watershed.
A. T. Mendes et al.309
However, the Union’s resources have been insuffcient and municipal projects do 
not clearly demonstrate a path toward the adoption of sustainable drainage (Mendes 
and Santos 2022). In addition, the federal government does not have clear criteria 
and metrics to classify and monitor whether allocations are consistent with sustain￾able drainage.
From the perspective of large cities, the great challenge to implement a sustain￾able urban drainage system is the consolidated stage of its urban space. These cities 
usually already have drainage systems and a high percentage of occupation and soil 
sealing. The restructuring of these systems runs into diffculties of an operational 
and fnancial nature, because, despite having greater revenue and technical capacity 
to obtain investments, the costs of retroft projects are extremely high, as shown by 
recent studies (Mississauga 2020; Wood 2020).
In Brazil, in small cities (less than 50,000 inhabitants, for example) the problem 
is usually different. In them, the urban space is an environment still in consolida￾tion, subject to less radical changes in its urban architecture and with areas suscep￾tible to the implementation of sustainable measures. Generally, in these cities there 
are available areas that support decent housing and sustainable infrastructure, 
requiring a frm decision for the planning and integrated management of policies, 
combined with the effort to comply with laws and behavioral changes of the 
population.
The federal government’s initiative, however, has no focus on the direct induc￾tion of sustainable solutions or on cities with the greatest defcit and on the promo￾tion of integrated actions with other policies. It is essential, therefore, that progress 
is made in demanding solutions in this regard, with allocations of Union and public￾private resources. In addition, the institutional and fscal issue, regarding long-term 
fnancial viability, remains outside the focus of projects leveraged within the scope 
of the Union, except in the case of large cities (Mendes and Santos 2022).
17.7 Conclusions
Throughout this chapter, historical and conjunctural elements of urban drainage 
services in Brazil were presented. The importance of encouraging and directing 
actions for the transition from investments in exclusively conventional systems to 
systems that promote the effcient use of nature-based infrastructure was highlighted.
Brazil potentially can encourage and direct sustainable actions, given the techni￾cal knowledge accumulated in public agencies, academia, and the private sector 
about sustainable urban drainage.
The adoption of these alternatives reaches different areas: environment; econ￾omy of cities (leisure, tourism, other low expenses); reduction of health expenses; 
reduction of impacts of events on people’s property, with the reduction of foods, 
landslides, and pollution. The studies show that the adoption of models of this 
nature can bring, in addition to environmental and hydrological improvement, sav￾ings in the implementation and maintenance of infrastructures.
17 Trajectory, Challenges, and Opportunities in Sustainable Urban Water…310
Some of the sustainable infrastructure models mentioned in this text have existed 
for over 50 years and that, in recent decades, they have been adopted in developed 
countries, modifying policies, integrating components of the urban structure, and 
making cities more resilient, green, and sustainable.
Despite this, there are gaps in directing resources to sustainable drainage proj￾ects. It is necessary to improve the criteria for allocation, selection, and monitoring 
of initiatives. Therefore, it is important that the fnancing and planning of urban 
infrastructures, by the Union, states, and city halls, induce behaviors and actions 
that converge with sustainability.

Nature-Based Solutions for Sustainable 
Stormwater Management as Means 
to Increase Resilience to Climate Change, 
Promote Circularity and Improve City 
Aesthetics
Stella Apostolaki
Abstract Safe provision and maintenance of water services, as well as the protec￾tion of ecosystems and urban communities from extreme climatic events, are 
becoming increasingly challenging. Climate change is undeniably adding pressure 
to cities. The continuing urbanisation, city expansion in unsustainable ways, the 
increased impermeability, the intensied urban heat island effect in combination 
with changes in weather patterns and the extreme phenomena due to climate change 
make cities even more vulnerable. It has clearly become obvious that conventional 
solutions in urban stormwater management, such as grey infrastructure, have 
already reached the limits in coping with the current and forthcoming impacts of 
climate change.
Focusing on nature-based solutions for stormwater management, this chapter 
aims to recognize their multiple benets and efciency not only in ood prevention 
but also in matters of climate mitigation and removal of carbon, climate adaptation 
and increase of resilience in urban environments. Furthermore, such nature-based 
solutions comprise a sustainability prototype by improving the water quality of the 
receiving watercourses, protecting ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem ser￾vices, enabling water reuse, and providing aesthetic, amenity and recreational 
services.

18.1 Introduction
Conventional solutions in urban stormwater management, such as grey infrastruc￾ture, have already reached the limits in coping with the current and forthcoming 
pressures, such as the continuous urbanisation, expansion of non-permeable sur￾face, and needless to say the impacts of climate change.
One big question emerging from the need to go towards sustainable practices for 
stormwater management is whether and how nature-based solutions can success￾fully respond to the increasing stress on water resources, biodiversity and city well￾being, especially under the added pressure deriving from climate change. Water 
scarcity that may result in drought, although not a new phenomenon in many parts 
of the world, is accelerated and is introducing additional stress in the water resources 
of areas facing physical water scarcity or even concerns for areas not traditionally 
facing similar problems. Urgent solutions are required for the European south, 
while in central and northern Europe such issues are newly introduced.
Nature-based solutions for sustainable stormwater management are aligned with 
the concepts of circular economy in the water cycle, they provide an additional 
water resource and are seen as a priority within the Green Deal. At the same time, 
they are in line with the European Water Framework Directive and national Climate 
Laws aiming to make our cities more resilient to climate change and to the unavoid￾able impacts of city expansions. Furthermore, the portrayed nature-based solutions 
address the principles of the New European Bauhaus initiative by beautifying cit￾ies (E.U., New European Bauhaus n.d) . They address the often-ignored element of 
landscape architecture in open urban spaces, which transforms the aesthetics of a 
culture by establishing strong links between ecology, beauty, society, culture and 
local topography, with benefts to ecosystem and biodiversity conservation, ame￾nity, recreation, circularity and cost-effciency.
18.2 Why Engage into Nature-Based Solutions 
for Water Management?
Nature-based stormwater management practices and rainwater harvesting are not 
new concepts; they’ve been engaged in early western civilisations. Stormwater 
drainage systems of the Minoan civilisation in Crete are still operational today, as in 
Villa Hagia Triada of Minoan Crete, after ca. 4000 years. The Minoan civilisation is 
characterized by the use of techniques to harvest rainwater, store and convey it, as 
well as legislative and institutional management of natural water resources 
(Angelakis and Koutsoyiannis 2003). It is worth mentioning that the most advanced 
drainage systems of ancient Greece were developed in semi-arid areas, where the 
need for water conveyance and conservation was evident (Angelakis et al. 2005).
Contemporary urban areas have to face additional pressures on water resources 
due to alterations in precipitation patterns related to climate change that intensify 
S. Apostolaki317
water scarcity or the occurrence and intensity of fooding incidences, fash fooding, 
mudslides and erosion. The rising urbanisation trends increase the demand for water 
use and at the same time result in reducing the percentage of permeable surfaces. 
Reduced percolation of water in the subsurface creates a dual problem: on one hand, 
the reduced groundwater aquifer recharge, thus reduced water availability potential, 
and on the other hand, excess amounts of runoff and increased fow rates linked to 
fash fooding. The treatment and reuse potential of runoff is adding value to the 
nature-based urban stormwater management systems. Consequently, nature-based 
sustainable stormwater management techniques, as a component of sustainable con￾struction, are gaining ground within new planning concepts.
The United Nations, the World Bank, the E.U., the EPA, the IUCN, and several 
conventions and funding schemes prioritize the use of nature-based solutions as 
means for adaptation to climate change and also for sustainable rainwater manage￾ment, for collection and treatment of runoff due to environmental and hygienic rea￾sons, and as a step towards sustainability (IFRC-WWF 2022).
Sustainable systems for treating runoff, with environmental, social, and fnancial 
benefts, are what were frst introduced in the USA as Best Management Practices 
(BMPs) (Urbonas and Stahre 1993; USEPA 1995). Soon they acquired the name 
Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) and primarily expanded to countries 
facing high fooding risks, such as the UK, Sweden, Japan, Britain, Switzerland, 
Germany, France, Australia, and South Africa. The Dunfermline Eastern Expansion 
in the UK comprises one of the regions where stormwater is primarily managed by 
nature-based solutions (SUDS) and not by conventional drainage (Campbell 2000; 
Krejci et al. 1991).
SUDS have been used as a living example of sustainable practices, which is 
applicable within urban areas. They have the potential to provide a series of benefts 
for the community on top of the reduction of the food hazard associated with large 
storm events by reducing the peak fow that causes fash fooding (Young et  al. 
1996). At the same time, they provide runoff treatment, the level of which differs 
according to type and scale and, therefore, leading to environmental benefts for the 
receiving watercourses as well as high reuse potential, closing in this way the loop 
in the water management and supporting circularity.
Unlike conventional drainage, nature-based solutions have the potential to widely 
transform public open spaces, creating new features that resemble natural ones and, 
consequently promoting the interaction between communities and their local envi￾ronments. The cognitive benefts, such as the re-establishment of the lost contact 
with nature, as well as the amenity and biodiversity benefts should not be ignored 
(Jefferies 1999).
In more detail, the nature-based solutions for rainwater management provide 
several benefts:
• Flood prevention. The systems provide attenuation of fow and reduction of peak 
fow that provide direct benefts related to reduced fash fooding risks. They 
often create new foodplains that can drain large areas.

• Provide land stability, reduce the risk of soil erosion and maintain good soil con￾ditions with obvious ecosystemic and food security benefts.
• Provide the possibility of water storage, both for above surface and for subsur￾face constructions with potential for water reuse.
• Succeed in reducing the pollutant load in the collected stormwater:
– Potential for water reuse, recommended for secondary non-drinking uses. 
They have the potential to create a new water resource, of particular interest 
for areas affected by water scarcity and drought.
– They reduce surface pollution and contribute to good ecological status of the 
receiving water bodies (rivers, lakes, beaches and bays).
• Have energy saving potential in the water cycle via the reduced need for water 
treatment.
• Recharge the groundwater aquifer and reduce the overfows.
• Bear water and air quality benefts – They provide protection from point and dif￾fuse pollution.
• Achieve reduction of stormwater treatment costs (reduced need for infrastruc￾ture, maintenance and operating costs) (Apostolaki and Jefferies 2009).
18.2.1 Urban Open Space Design 
and Sustainable Construction
The sustainability element of the nature-based solutions for stormwater manage￾ment is depicted in the ‘three-ring model’ (Butler 2002), which is an interpretation 
based on the intersection between the social, environmental and economic goals of 
sustainable development (Jefferies and Bray 2003) (Fig. 18.1).
Fig. 18.1 Conceptual overlaps between the three value areas: ecology, community, delight and 
quality, quantity, and amenity of SUDS. (Adopted by Thompson 2002; Butler 2002, included in 
Apostolaki and Duffy 2016)
S. Apostolaki319
This tri-valent design demonstrates the multifunctional and multilevel role of 
nature-based solutions through the increase or introduction of vegetation that fur￾ther attracts wildlife and often creates a new ecosystem, with undeniable urban 
biodiversity and community benefts.
18.2.1.1 Operation Principles of Nature-Based Solutions 
for Stormwater Management
Using natural methods that mimic environmental processes, the nature-based solu￾tions succeed their purpose in stormwater management. The nature-based solutions 
use surface and underground constructions based on water fow through gravita￾tional and infltration methods to convey runoff from the road surface to a central￾ised system or network for collection, management, treatment and even reuse.
Layers of inert material of different diameters are selected to enhance percola￾tion in the underground water collection. The infltration material enables not only 
conveyance of runoff and reduction of fow speed, but also water treatment, which 
depending on the selected gravel, on the depth of the layer and on the design char￾acteristics, may range from removal of solid and dissolved matter to reduction of 
organic load, nutrient removal even heavy metal removal (to a lesser extent). 
Furthermore, the stormwater can be collected in aboveground or underground con￾structions, reservoirs or tanks with the potential for reuse or release on receiving 
natural water bodies.
Runoff management with the use of nature-based solutions involves:
1. Sustainable Practices: It refers to everyday practices aiming to reduce the pollut￾ant load in runoff through the actions of informed citizens, who undertake pollu￾tion prevention actions, such as control of pollutant disposal, and reduced use of 
chemicals, detergents, and oils. Information and educational efforts are the key 
to this direction.
2. Source Control: It refers to constructions made to attenuate runoff in small 
catchments, of approximately 5 acres (neighbourhood level). It includes systems 
based on vegetated or gravelled surfaces that allow water removal from the sur￾face through infltration.
3. Site Control: These constructions serve larger catchments of 2–5 ha and may be 
applied in industrial or residential development. Although similar to Source 
Control, those are slightly larger. In addition, the percolation medium is care￾fully selected in the case of industrial establishments.
4. Regional Control: Mainly refers to large-scale systems, serving areas greater 
than 10 ha. Common types of nature-based solutions are ponds and wetlands that 
highly resemble natural ecosystems. They demonstrate high treatment potential 
based on natural aeration for the reduction of organic load and on nutrient 
removal (Campbell 2000; Jefferies 1999; Morales-Torres et al. 2015).

18.2.1.2 Technical Characteristics of Nature-Based Solutions 
for Stormwater Management
Nature-based solutions include different types of constructions with their own spec￾ifcations and implementation at different scales, as previously described. Technical 
information on nature-based solutions for stormwater management can be found 
under the term SUDS in the CIRIA SUDS Manual (Woods et al. 2015). Such con￾structions are briefy described below.
Systems for Source and Site Control
Infltration Trenches. They are shallow excavated ditches from 3 to 12 ft deep, flled 
with grass, gravel, stone, or sand. They allow water infltration and underground 
storage or conveyance to underground pipes. Infltration trenches are used for 
areas of 5 acres maximum surface; they are not recommended for soils with high 
clay content or in hardened soils with low water absorption. They provide fow 
attenuation for small sites and groundwater recharge, as well as solid waste 
removal. They have short lifespan, relatively high capital and maintenance cost, 
and they might cause clogging and groundwater pollution. They are often sup￾ported by pre-treatment device to reduce the risk of clogging.
Soakways. They are dry wells, vertical in the ground, allowing underground water 
storage. Water has no outlet other than percolation to the soil and groundwater 
recharge. They are often used at household level and they may provide immedi￾ate support of vegetated areas and gardens with water from the soil.
Bioretention Areas and Rain Gardens. Vegetated shallow depressions covered with 
native vegetation or soil cover that allows for high infltration and runoff removal. 
The systems, through the native soil type and vegetation, allow for increased soil 
moisture and support resilience to seasonal changes as well as removal of pollut￾ants and water retention. The trees and plants are watered through the soil mois￾ture. In case of small-scale depressions, they are often called Rain Gardens.
Porous Pavement. High porosity man-made pavement, made of porous asphalt, 
porous concrete or concrete blocks, bricks, reinforced plastic mats, with large 
underground storage capacity. The runoff is drained down through the irregularly 
shaped pervious materials (gravel, sand or grass turf) that covers voids. The run￾off is led to underground perforated pipes or to the underlying subsoil, while the 
sides and the bottom of the reservoir are covered with flter fabric or geotextile to 
block further percolation. The reason is the use of porous pavements in car parks, 
light traffc roads or sidewalks, the runoff from which may contain several pol￾lutants, such as heavy metals and oils, that may be toxic for the groundwater 
aquifer. They comprise an effective way for food control in urban areas and they 
often balance the rate of impermeable surfaces in cities. Vacuum cleaning is an 
advisable maintenance solution to reduce the risk of clogging.
Swales. Grassed ditches allowing small water storage, however they are cost￾effcient in water conveyance. They are used for areas less than 10 acres. They 
control fow speeds and attenuate fows. They are often replacing conventional 
pipes, while they allow infltration into the soil through the grass and the gravel 
S. Apostolaki321
below. The water depth usually does not exceed 0.1 m, while on average, they 
achieve pollution removal up to 30%. They are often used at household level or 
on the side of roads to protect from side erosion (Morales-Torres et al. 2015; 
Woods et al. 2015; Apostolaki and Jefferies 2009).
Systems for Site and Regional Control
Detention (Dry) Ponds. Facilities without permanent water that look as dry depres￾sions of land or wide ditches. They receive water from inlets, allow high rate of 
infltration and are able to store water during high peak fow events. They drain 
within 12–24 h following the peak fow event. They are used for the removal of 
suspended solids, and do not provide biological treatment. The pond also has a 
safety overfow for cases of storm events. Semiannual inspections for plant con￾trol, repair of eroded areas, and inlet and outlet repairs are recommended.
Retention (Wet) Ponds. Storage facilities with permanent water. They receive water 
from the surrounding area through inlets often connected with grassed or grav￾elled ditches, or swales or infltration trenches and resemble natural ponds. They 
are ideal for areas with levels of precipitation that can sustain a permanent water 
pool of 1.3–2.0 m depth with a 3.0 m maximum recommended depth. Above the 
permanent water pool, a 2-m depth buffer zone is constructed for peak fow con￾trol, as well as a shallow zone used as a biological flter (Novotny and Olem 
1994). The pond retains water for approximately 21  days, thus it provides 
removal of organic load that may reach up to 70% reduction as well as a 50% 
reduction in phosphorous rates (Urbonas and Stahre 1993). The vegetation cover 
is approximately 25–50% of the pond surface area. Regular monitoring for 
aquatic growth, shore erosion, and inlet and outlet blockages is recommended.
Wetlands. Artifcial wetlands retain permanent water that extends to wide land 
cover, even up to some square kilometres depending on the amount of water 
reaching the construction, while maintaining an average depth of 0.5–0.75 m. 
They have wide vegetation cover that reaches up to 75% of the surface area, 
mainly with hydrophytes and they form hotspots of biodiversity similar to the 
natural wetlands. They act as foodplains providing high food protection and 
they are often introduced for the treatment of dissolved biodegradable pollutants. 
The rate of organic load reduction is higher during the ‘active’ growing season, 
which for the northern hemisphere is between May and September (Novotny and 
Olem 1994). Monitoring includes inspections for erosion, for inlet and outlet 
blockage and for vegetation control (Morales-Torres et al. 2015; Woods et al. 
2015; Apostolaki and Jefferies 2009).
18.2.2 Adaptation to Climate Change and Biodiversity Benefts
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and 
the World Wide Fund For Nature (Formerly World Wildlife Fund) (WWF) have 
recently issued a report on nature-based solutions and their contribution in the effort 
18 Nature-Based Solutions for Sustainable Stormwater Management as Means…322
to reduce climate change and weather-related disasters. In this report the necessity 
to implement nature-based solution is underlined. Nature-based solutions have been 
recognized to have the ability to reduce climate change risks and intensity by 26%. 
Nature-based solutions, through the increase in vegetation and surface water vol￾umes, succeed in CO2 sequestration and are considered as carbon sinks. In addition, 
they are portrayed to offer valuable protection against climate-induced disaster, i.e., 
fooding, soil erosion, landslides, and from the related economic costs. In develop￾ing countries only, fnancial benefts deriving from the implementation of nature￾based solutions could save at least US$104 billion by 2030 and US$393 billion by 
2050 (IFRC-WWF 2022).
Nature-based solutions are expected to provide relief for populations severely 
affected by climate change and weather-related disasters. Flood, drought and storms 
are expected to increase putting populations at risk and increasing the need of 
humanitarian assistance, at a rate of 150 million people per year by 2030 and of 200 
million people per year by 2050. In the decade between 2010 and 2019, 410,000 
people are estimated to have lost their lives as a result of sudden-onset climate 
change and weather-related disasters (IFRC-WWF 2022). The number of climate 
migrants is also expected to rise dramatically in the next decades.
Nature-based solutions for stormwater management have high potential for 
adaptation and increased resilience to climate change. Depending on the type of 
solution selected and the topography of the region where they are applied, nature￾based solutions provide different levels of protection from climate change. Surface 
water solutions, such as ponds and wetlands, with big volumes of water and big land 
cover and shore vegetation, as well as large-scale bioretention facilities, supported 
by relatively large vegetated areas including trees have the ability to remove signif￾cant amounts of CO2. Even the selection of inert material, such as crushed concrete 
and brick demolition waste that have the ability to form soil carbonates (Jorat et al. 
2017; Manning and Renforth 2013), as well as the type of trees and the way they 
have been planted, play signifcant role in the rate of CO2 removal from the atmo￾sphere and enhance the stormwater removal potential (Berland et al. 2017; Adam 
et al. 2017).
Climate change, ecosystem degradation and changes in land use patterns are also 
considered to be responsible for an increase in zoonotic diseases with high cost for 
human lives. Nature-based solutions that create new ecosystems signifcantly con￾tribute in reducing this risk and providing physical, mental and psychological health 
benefts that increase the resilience of the society (FEBA 2020; Karjalainen 
et al. 2010).
Nature-based solutions clearly beneft urban biodiversity. The aboveground sys￾tems mainly depend on vegetation cover, attract insects, including pollinators, cur￾rently at high risk, as well as other species, i.e., birds. The belowground systems 
also contribute in increasing the soil biodiversity and providing stability of land that 
work in circular, synergistic ways for biodiversity conservation. The benefts deriv￾ing from balancing the impacts of drought, heatwaves, increase in average tempera￾ture and the urban heat island effect are signifcant in protecting biodiversity 
S. Apostolaki323
(ILO-UNEP-IUCN 2022). In urban environments, within which the presence of 
native fora and fauna is very limited, biodiversity preservation is even more urging.
The EU Biodiversity Strategy, Target 2 – Action 6 (2011), promotes the use of 
green infrastructure, including the development of an EU Green and Blue 
Infrastructure (2019). Although nature-based solutions appear in the EU Biodiversity 
and Green Infrastructure Strategies, the concept of ‘working with nature’ only 
appears in the latter (Davis et al. 2017).
In 2016, IUCN members and the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) adopted a 
resolution recognising the use of natural solutions to achieve simultaneous benefts 
for biodiversity and human well-being: ‘actions to protect, conserve, restore, sus￾tainably use and manage natural or modifed terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and 
marine ecosystems, which address social, economic and environmental challenges 
effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, eco￾system services and resilience and biodiversity benefts’.
18.2.3 Urban Open Spaces of High Amenity and Aesthetics
Nature-based solutions have the potential to create open urban spaces and introduce 
a new culture around aesthetics establishing strong links between ecology, beauty, 
culture, geography, and local topography. By making water an obvious feature of 
urban landscapes and bringing citizens close to it, rainwater management is evolv￾ing and moving towards a system of high amenity.
Amenity in contemporary thinking and design is associated with services pro￾vided, aesthetics, contact with nature, landscape and biodiversity preservation, rec￾reation, leisure and pleasure, and attractiveness. Recreating the urban environment 
that resembles natural ecosystems is synonymous for a call for conservation and 
high aesthetics.
In order to characterize an area as a place of high amenity value, a sense of bal￾ance and interaction between people and nature is vital (Taylor 1998). Sustainable 
design, even when it comes to stormwater management systems has to be reconsid￾ered so as to create a sense of connection between nature and urban citizens, and 
thus promote a sense of stewardship for the environment. (Dalton 1994). The con￾temporary design of open urban spaces promotes an ethics of nature that encom￾passes respect, sympathy, care, concern, compassion, gratitude, friendship, 
responsibility (Van De Veer 1998; Jamieson 2001) and appreciation for species 
(Apostolaki and Duffy 2016).
Public perception surveys on nature-based solutions, primarily ponds and wet￾lands in the UK (Apostolaki et al. 2006; Apostolaki and Jefferies 2009) have identi￾fed the need for urban water-bodies landscape design with amenity and high 
aesthetics in mind. The public seems to appreciate urban design of systems which 
are natural looking. Furthermore, amenity and high aesthetics are associated in peo￾ple’s minds with ideas such as visual and habitat enhancement, wildlife and biodi￾versity benefts, access to recreation, relaxation and leisure, stress relief and other 
18 Nature-Based Solutions for Sustainable Stormwater Management as Means…324
social services as well as educational benefts. High aesthetics are even able to alle￾viate safety concerns deriving from exposure to open water bodies (Apostolaki 
et al. 2006).
The restoration of ecologically degraded urban landscapes with the implementa￾tion of nature-based solutions is along the lines of the New European Bauhaus 
Initiative (E.U., New European Bauhaus n.d) and also serves a number of important 
functions (Tress et al. 2001):
• Conceptual: the sense of re-establishment of the lost contact with nature that cre￾ates a sense of integration in the society rather than isolation, reunion with nature, 
relief to everyday stress. Emotional, cognitive, behavioural, children develop￾ment and education, as well as social benefts are also observed (Rohde and 
Kendle 1997).
• Cultural: the development of a culture of contact with nature and species as well 
as an ecological view of a newly introduce landscape are affected by its history 
(Taylor 2002) and at the same time have the potential to create the heritage of the 
future in a city.
• Ecological: contemporary landscape architecture is using nature both literally 
and fguratively. In the case of nature-based solutions it supports the introduction 
of native ecology within urban open spaces over earlier designs that focused on 
exotic species (Whiston Spirn, in Johnson 2002).
• Social: Public open spaces created by nature-based solutions provide a sense of 
unifcation and democracy, bringing cultures and individuals together. They act 
as outdoor rooms within a neighbourhood, a place to relax, and enjoy the urban 
experience and the social interaction (Ward Thompson 2002).
• Psychological: Access to nature in urban environments provides relief from anxi￾ety and health benefts, both psychological and physical.
What makes scenery look beautiful and acceptable by the public is hard to defne. 
The aesthetic function of urban landscapes has always been a matter of concern. 
Nature-based solutions for stormwater management amongst other benefts also 
introduce high aesthetics in a sector that was until recently dealt in purely engineer￾ing terms, which widely ignored the concept of beauty in construction. The New 
European Bauhaus (E.U., New European Bauhaus n.d) movement introduces a new 
concept, which is fully aligned with the nature-based sustainable drainage systems, 
a concept that combines Sustainability with Beauty, Art and Culture.
18.3 The Policy Framework
Although sustainable management of resources is not a very recent concept, nature￾based solutions in urban design have been very recently introduced or implied in a 
series of legislative frameworks and funding priority schemes. It is worth mention￾ing here that the frst type of nature-based solutions that was promoted in EU poli￾cies was referring to water retention systems and their benefts (Fig. 18.2).
S. Apostolaki325
Fig. 18.2 Introduction of NbS-related terms in EU policies. (Davis et al. 2017)
Overall, the references in policy encourage the use of nature-based solutions 
without necessarily including mandatory instruments. Only a small proportion of 
instruments (13%), however, require for their implementation, such as the Habitats 
Directive, the Water Framework Directive to what relates to food risk management, 
and the Natura 2000 sites. The EU Biodiversity Strategy includes instruments, but 
only with respect to establishing strategic frameworks for ecosystem restoration. 
Frameworks where the use of nature-based solutions is implied are the SDG (2015), 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC 1992) 
and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertifcation (UNCCD). All the 
other policy frameworks refer to the more generalized term of ecosystem-based 
approaches, yet without compulsory character regarding implementation:
• The resumed ffth session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA 5.2) resolu￾tion on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development (UNEP/
EA.5/Res.5, 2022).
• UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015).
• Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN Department of Economic and 
Social Affairs 2015).
• United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC 
1992 -entered into force 1994).
• E.U. Water Framework Directive (2000).
• Convention on Biological Diversity (UNEP 1992).
• The Ramsar Conventions on Wetlands (IUCN 1989).
• United Nations Convention to Combat Desertifcation (UNCCD 1994).
• New Urban Agenda (UN Habitat 2017).
Nature-based solutions for water management are aligned with the United 
Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals in profound ways:
• Green investments address SDG 1 for poverty reduction.
18 Nature-Based Solutions for Sustainable Stormwater Management as Means…326
• Urban agriculture that can be supported by rainwater harvesting or in rain-fed 
gardens (rain gardens) is linked to SDG 2 for ensuring food security and improved 
nutrition.
• Urban ecological zones (e.g., green infrastructure, green zones such as rain gar￾dens) are linked to SDG 3 for health and well-being. This goal is addressed also 
through the physical, mental and psychological health benefts offered.
• Education based on the implementation of nature-based solution is linked to 
SDG 4 for inclusive and equitable quality education and promotion of lifelong 
learning.
• Natural water retention projects are directly linked to SDG 6 for access to clean 
water and sanitation through the sustainable management of water resources.
• Climate adaptation strategies are linked to SDG 13 on climate action as well as 
on SDG 7 for sustainable energy.
• Innovative farming initiatives that can be supported by these systems are linked 
to SDG 8 for sustainable economic growth as well as to SDG 1.
• Urban restoration or redesign with the use of nature-based solutions is linked to 
SDG 10 for reducing inequalities and for promoting social interactions, social 
cohesion and inclusiveness in the newly established green open spaces in cities.
• Vegetated open green spaces and water features are linked to SDG 11 for sustain￾able cities and communities, to SDG 3 on human health and well-being, SDG 10 
on reducing inequalities and of course SDG 13 on climate action.
• Urban restoration projects including retroftting of nature-based solutions in 
urban water management are linked to SDG 12 for ensuring sustainable con￾sumption of resources (matter, energy, etc.).
• Coastal protection initiatives and creation of new water features in foodplains, 
such as the construction of ponds and wetlands are linked to SDG 14 for the 
sustainable management and marine resources. Furthermore, the water treatment 
potential of nature-based solutions clearly contributes to the EU WFD goal for 
ensuring good ecological status of all water bodies.
• Protection of land from fooding and erosion is linked to SDG 15 on life on land. 
The biodiversity benefts of the systems are undeniably addressing SDG 15.
• The creation of residential green corridors, green open spaces and new water 
bodies are linked to SDG 16 for the promotion of inclusive and just societies 
(Adopted by Somarakis et al. 2019).
Along these lines, the Water Services Regulation Authority for England and 
Wales (OFWAT 2008) proposes nature-based solutions (SUDS) to be incorporated 
in the drainage system as a means to address climate change adaptation. In addition, 
it stresses the responsibility of companies and consumers to commit to reduce the 
number of properties at risk from sewer overfow through the adoption of nature￾based solutions.
The EU Research and Innovation (R&I) has produced a policy agenda on nature￾based solutions aiming to promote the systems widely and make the EU a leader in 
this sector. The Horizon 2020 includes signifcant strands for the funding of projects 
on nature-based solutions, reaching up to a total budget of €282 m and satisfying the 
S. Apostolaki327
goals of the European Green Deal aiming to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. 
The European Green Deal Circular Economy Action Plan adopted in 2020 promotes 
circularity in all sectors including the water sector. The E.U. New Bauhaus Initiative 
beautiful | sustainable | together (E.U., New European Bauhaus n.d) connects the 
European Green Deal to our living spaces and experiences in a profound way that 
places natural and natural-like ecosystems in the centres of our cities, in an effort to 
create sustainable and livable cities (E.U. NEB). Other EU instruments worth men￾tioning include COST, ERDF, LIFE+ and EIB’s Natural Capital Financing Facility 
(Wild et al. 2020).
18.4 Conclusion: The Way Forward
Nature-based solutions in stormwater management are portrayed as solutions able 
to address contemporary and future challenges. They have very high potential for 
further improving their sustainability element and overcoming barriers in imple￾mentation. The capital cost is often a deterrent in implementing the systems, espe￾cially in cases of retroftting, where even costs relating to purchase of land may 
apply, it is however, outbalanced by the low maintenance cost. Although we cannot 
claim that nature-based solutions are always fully sustainable, they are to a wide 
extent self-maintained. The more well-established these systems become the more 
the maintenance requirement reduces. However, in the Morales-Torres et al. (2015) 
report, detailed cost assessment of capital and maintenance costs for all types of 
such solutions are included, clearly indicating very low capital and maintenance 
costs for new constructions. In addition to cost, retroftting of solutions faces addi￾tional constraints, which are related to technical issues and know-how in implemen￾tation. There is often lack of awareness or technical knowledge among consultants, 
developers, and even water authorities, regarding the effectiveness and implementa￾tion of nature-based solutions.
Another crucial barrier relates to the current policy framework, which although 
recognizes the importance of introducing nature-based solutions for water manage￾ment, as means to adapt to climate change, to enhance circularity in the urban water 
cycle, and promote biodiversity and aesthetic benefts, it still does not have a man￾datory character.
Other constraints include the diffculty in the economic valuation of the ecosys￾tem services. The economic assessment of ecosystem services and the full water 
cost recovery that addresses concepts such as the environmental cost, the resource 
cost and the fnancial cost (capital, operational and maintenance), as described in 
the E.U. Water Framework Directive, are cornerstones in sustainable water manage￾ment (Tsani et al. 2021).
Public opinion, on the other hand, plays a major role in the adoption of the sys￾tems. Public concerns that have to be overcome include safety that relates mainly to 
the presence of open water bodies in urban areas. Furthermore, the design of such 
systems may deter citizens from making use of the new area. Green open spaces and

Apostolaki and Jefferies (2009)
water bodies primarily have the potential to strengthen social cohesion, create a 
sense of culture in the community inspired by the cultural and natural heritage of the 
area, and promote inclusiveness and gentrifcation. However, if such systems are not 
designed with safety and societal benefts in mind, they often have the opposite 
results.
As the result of a public perception research of nature-based solutions in the UK 
(Apostolaki and Jefferies 2009), a series of recommendations can be formed regard￾ing the systems’ design and implementation characteristics, operation and mainte￾nance, and public education. Among other recommendations, regular monitoring 
and maintenance are key to successful implementation and to enhancing the use by 
the citizens (Table 18.1).
One of the tools in enhancing applicability of nature-based solutions is certainly 
education and the engagement in bottom-up participatory approaches and capacity 
building that involves all stakeholders and interested parties. Deep understanding of 
the importance of closing the loop in the water cycle could further reshape attitudes 
and increase the popularity of those systems.
Answers to all the aforementioned barriers should be sought using a combination 
of approaches including new regulations for the design and implementation of 
stormwater management schemes, training of relevant professionals by experts, and 
public inclusion in the decision-making processes.

Nature-Based Solutions for Circular 
Management of Urban Water in the Built 
Environment of Sri Lanka
Panchali Weerakoon and Menaha Thayaparan
Abstract As a result of rapid urbanisation, water supply has become one of the 
major social challenges in urban areas. A growing awareness of “nature-based solu￾tions (NbS)” can adapt and respond effectively to social challenges and natural haz￾ards. Urban areas in Sri Lanka face a signi­cant water crisis due to increased 
demand and decreased natural resources. The urban construction projects in Sri 
Lanka speci­cally need to manage water during the construction process. Although 
the concept of NbS has been discussed in the context of Sri Lanka regarding envi￾ronmental problems, no discussions have been carried out regarding NbS for the 
circular management of urban water in the Sri Lankan construction environment. 
Hence this paper aims to focus on the possible application of NbS in effectively 
contributing to circular management of urban water in the built environment of SL, 
which in turn will lead towards sustainable city concept. Semi-structured interviews 
were carried out with industry experts to gather knowledge on NbS and circular 
water management in urban construction projects. Findings of this paper have sug￾gested a pathway for the implementation of circular urban water management as a 
combat to overcome the current problem of the linear approach with the use of NbS 
in the Sri Lankan built environment.

19.1 Introduction
Abusive activities of mankind towards the Earth System have been refected through 
the impacts on changes in climate and alterations in natural cycles such as water, 
carbon or nitrogen and resulted in land degradation and desertifcation (Tarrasón 
et al. 2016; Vu et al. 2014). With rapid urbanisation in the last few decades, supply￾ing water has become one of the most crucial factors in urban areas (Giordano and 
Shah 2014; Pearlmutter et al. 2021). All kinds of water resources available in urban 
areas, such as natural surface water, groundwater, drinking water, sewage, stormwa￾ter, food overfow water and re-cycled water, can be known as urban water (Oral 
et al. 2020). Worldwide frequent issues concerning urban water management are 
water scarcity, surface water fooding and pollution of freshwater (Chan et al. 2018). 
The linear approach towards water consumption has been identifed as one of the 
main reasons for water scarcity (Luo et al. 2019), for instance, refers to the tradi￾tional way of extracting freshwater, using the extracted potable water for human 
needs and disposing of it after into natural water bodies as waste (Daigger 2009). 
The implementation of circular management in the water sector is to combat water 
scarcity to defeat current problems due to the liner approach (Voulvoulis 2018). 
According to Mbavarira and Grimm (2021) and Zhijun and Nailing (2007), circular 
water management is a 3R concept which can be elaborated as: reduce, re-use and 
re-cycling. Further, the benefts through circular water management are not only to 
provide clean water and sanitation for all (Meiryani et al. 2022), but also to ensure 
food security, reduce poverty and preserve ecosystems (Molden et al. 2007).
The growing awareness towards “nature-based solutions (NbS)” is an integrated 
approach capable of addressing societal challenges (Seddon et al. 2019) and natural 
hazards adaptively and effectively (Oral et al. 2020). The construction industry con￾sumes 25% of global water (Chuai et al. 2015; Yeheyis et al. 2013) also, nearly 
500 L of freshwater is used for mixing every m3
 of concrete (Ghrair et al. 2018). 
Besides, a considerable amount of freshwater is used during the process of concrete 
as well as for concrete curing (Ghrair et al. 2018). This high usage of freshwater in 
the built environment negatively impacts the environment and natural water cycles 
(Varshney et al. 2021). In Sri Lanka, the capital city, Colombo, is facing a major 
water crisis due to the increasing demand and shrinkage of existing natural resources 
(Wickramasinghe 2019). Simultaneously, according to the Environmental 
Management and Monitoring Report in urban areas such as Vauvniya and Mannar, 
inadequate and poor water supply exists in major (SMEC International in associa￾tion with Ocyana Consultants and Ceywater Consultants (Pvt) Ltd 2016). 
Waidyasekara et al. (2014) have particularly stated the necessity to manage water 
during the construction process in the Sri Lankan construction industry. In urban 
settlements, NbS is necessary to effectively manage water (Alemaw et al. 2020) 
since it admittedly restores natural ecosystems (Oral et al. 2020). Even though the 
concept of NbS has been discussed in Sri Lankan context in terms of environmental 
problems (Ranagalage et al. 2020), no discussions have been carried out regarding 
NbS for circular management of Urban Water in the Sri Lankan built environment. 
P. Weerakoon and M. Thayaparan335
Accordingly, this chapter will focus on circular urban water management with the 
use of NbS in the Sri Lankan built environment. The objectives of the book chapter 
are to review the NbS used in the built environment and their effectiveness in global 
and Sri Lankan contexts; to analyse the signifcance of circular management of 
urban water in the built environment; to investigate how NbS contributes to the 
circular management of urban water in the built environment in Sri Lanka; and to 
develop a pathway to enhance the circular management of urban water in the built 
environment of Sri Lanka using NbS.
19.2 Literature Review
19.2.1 Nature-Based Solutions in the Built Environment: 
Benefts and Barriers
The concept of NbS is a systematic ecological theory summarised from practices 
(Dushkova and Haase 2020). It frst appeared in the typical scientifc literature in the 
early 2000s, focusing on solutions to agricultural problems, including integrated 
pest control and habitat use to mitigate farm water fows (Pearlmutter et al. 2021). 
NbS is defned as a natural inspired and supported cost-effective method that pro￾vides benefts to the triple bottom line (environment, society and economy) (Pontee 
et al. 2016; Santiago Fink 2016). Conceptual-wise, NbS aims to incorporate nature 
in cities, landscapes and seascapes, particularly natural features and processes. The 
necessity to protect natural capital and ecosystem services is increasingly recog￾nised as the foundation of sustainable development progress (Raymond et al. 2017). 
NbS is rapidly reaching the top of the Sustainable Development Agenda as an 
ecosystem-based approach to coping with and adapting to climate change and is 
also improving the living and biodiversity of people (Cousins 2021). At the same 
time, in the early 2000s, when NbS concept was formed, it began to appear in the 
discussions related to land management and planning as well as in the management 
of water resources, including the use of wetlands for wastewater treatment (Guo 
et al. 2000; Kayser and Kunst 2002; Stefanakis 2022). In the urban context, NbS 
often acts as an umbrella concept to improve the sustainability of cities (Pontee 
et al. 2016; Somarakis et al. 2019). NbS offers exciting possibilities and is being 
adopted in urban planning, which is concerned with forming cities, towns and 
regions through development, infrastructure and services management (Wheeler 
2013), around the world in order to offer several benefts and reduce climate risks 
(Frantzeskaki et al. 2019).
Architects have been using materials and technologies enabled by nature 
throughout history. Global indigenous buildings are characterised by buildings 
made of local materials and often exhibit remarkable unity with their environment 
(Blaser 1982). Natural stone can be considered as one of the most important con￾struction materials, mainly due to its strength and durability, and is traditionally

used to form whole cottages or houses with thick stone walls that support a grass 
roof with living grass seed (Blaser 1982). As such “natural-based solutions” is not a 
new phenomenon in the built environment. Implementing NbS in the built environ￾ment can provide considerable benefts as discussed below.
According to the EKLIPSE framework, several social problems as shown in 
Fig. 19.1, can be solved with the use of NbS.
Among the social challenges mentioned above, water management will be 
focused in urban areas in this chapter.
NbS can help solve all three problems linked with water management: food risk, 
water scarcity and water quality, for example, using or imitating natural processes 
such as infltration, heat and weed treatment (Haase et al. 2014). Additionally, NbS 
can increase infltration, improve evapotranspiration, provide rainwater storage 
areas and contribute to sustainable urban water management by eliminating pollut￾ants (EKLIPSE Expert Working Group 2017).
Despite the benefts discussed, the implementation of NbS also faces several bar￾riers. Barriers such as higher costs, multifunctionality and performance uncertainty 
are mainly due to the unawareness of the benefts of the NbS or diffculty in valuing 
nature’s social and economic benefts (Sarabi et  al. 2020). Inadequate fnancial 
resources (Denjean et al. 2017; Frantzeskaki et al. 2017; Santoro et al. 2019), the 
length of time taken to realise the benefts of NbS (Frantzeskaki et al. 2017), path

dependency (Davies and Lafortezza 2019; Denjean et al. 2017), inadequate regula￾tions (Denjean et al. 2017; Kronenberg et al. 2017), uncertainty regarding the imple￾mentation process and effectiveness of the solutions (Albert et al. 2019; Chen et al. 
2019; Denjean et al. 2017; Frantzeskaki et al. 2017) are some other signifcant bar￾riers identifed towards the implementation of NbS.
19.2.2 Signifcance of Urban Water Management 
in the Built Environment
By the year 2050, urbanisation is expected to accelerate up to 68%, globally (United 
Nations 2018). As the population increases, resource consumption also increases, 
and by 2050 global material consumption is expected to reach about 90 billion tons 
(IRP 2018). The focus of this study is one of the essential, limited and renewable 
natural resources, “water”. Water is the most valuable natural resource (Esham et al. 
2018), which plays a signifcant role in human well-being, socio-economic develop￾ment and sustainable ecosystem (United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) 
2009). Also, it is an essential resource for all living beings (Nika et al. 2020). Water 
is undoubtedly linked to the development of a country: it is the core of the produc￾tion and conservation of many benefts and services for human beings and ecosys￾tems (Colella et al. 2021).
Water scarcity, surface water fooding and freshwater pollution can be known as 
more frequently occurring Urban Water Management (UWM) issues worldwide 
(Chan et al. 2018). Most freshwater entering the city is used for consumption, while 
the rest is polluted, treated and emitted (Pradhan et al. 2019). All kinds of water in 
an urban environment, including natural surface water, groundwater, drinking water, 
wastewater, stormwater, fooding water and recycled water (third pipe, stormwater 
harvesting, wastewater mining and groundwater management), refer to urban water 
(Oral et al. 2020). UWM can be defned as a combination of four central schemes: 
water supply, urban drainage, wastewater treatment and stormwater treatment. 
Additionally, UWM consists of planning, designing and operating infrastructure to 
protect drinking water and sanitation, control stormwater infltration and discharge, 
and recreation parks and urban ecosystem maintenance (Larsen and Gujer 1997). 
World Water Development Report issued in 2017 has stated that more than 80% of 
the world’s wastewater is discharged without treatment; on that account, wastewater 
continues to be an “unexploited resource” (Boretti and Rosa 2019). Thus, as a way 
forward towards the circular management of urban water more sustainable practices 
are expected.
Over the past few decades, global urbanisation has increased exponentially, coin￾ciding with the growth of the human population, and the use of material resources 
has increased (Purchase et al. 2022). Due to urbanisation, the demand towards the 
construction sector has also increased. The relationship between urbanisation and 
demand for building materials is rigid (Augiseau and Barles 2017). Construction 
19 Nature-Based Solutions for Circular Management of Urban Water in the Built…338
uses a large percentage of natural resources (32%) (Yeheyis et al. 2013), and its 
water resource consumption is signifcant (Bardhan 2011); for instance, it is about 
50% of freshwater (Dixon 2010). Further, it has been recognised that construction 
activities are one of the signifcant contributors towards water pollution (Shen and 
Tam 2002). The Western Region has the most energy and water-intensive construc￾tion activity when considering the global conception due to its backward economy 
and outdated technology development (Hong et al. 2019). Concrete production con￾sumes the highest percentage of water among all the other construction activities. In 
the year of 2012, cement production accounted for 9% of global industrial water 
emissions, and in 2050 75% of cement production water demand was predicted to 
occur in areas affected by water pressure (Miller et al. 2018). Besides, a consider￾able amount of freshwater will also be used during the concrete curing process 
(Ghrair et al. 2018). Reducing water consumption and improving building water 
effciency are essential in sustainable water management in the built environment, 
but the Strategic Construction Forum emphasises that water use during construction 
is considered a low priority (Waylen et al. 2011). As water management in the built 
environment is essential, some researchers have researched water effciency (WE) 
in the construction phase of buildings, while others have studied various water eff￾ciency measures in the design phase (Carragher et al. 2012).
As discussed above, the built environment in urban areas relies on urban water 
consumption, where urban water management is considered an immediate action 
that all parties must attend to. However, there is a lack of evidence to prove effective 
and effcient urban water management in the built environment. Hence this book 
chapter further explores using nature-based solutions for circular urban water man￾agement in the built environment.
19.2.3 NbS for Circular Urban Water Management 
in the Built Environment
The report issued at the World Water Forum in March 2018 by the United Nations 
World Water Assessment Program (Sowińska-Świerkosz and García 2022) men￾tioned that NbS for water had gained attention. The report advocates working with 
nature as an essential element to improve water resource management and ensures 
water security for all, moving beyond what is known as a conventional approach to 
water management (UN-Water 2018). NbS is a step towards such a “green” infra￾structure, including “natural” water management processes (Kooy et al. 2020). In 
the highly urbanised environment, there is usually a lack of space for complete 
“nature-based” solutions; as a result, traditional infrastructure must be integrated 
with green solutions (Sowińska-Świerkosz and García 2022). To address such prob￾lems related to the quality and availability of water in cities, NbS is developing 
green infrastructure to improve the sustainability of grey infrastructure by combin￾ing green infrastructure technology (Kooy et al. 2020).
P. Weerakoon and M. Thayaparan339
A circular water system cannot simply connect the existing wastewater treatment 
plant’s outlet to the water supply system, especially in urban areas where stormwa￾ter management, food prevention, climate mitigation or urban greening are more 
urgent than water scarcity (Oral et al. 2021).
As all urban water issues are interdependent and cannot be solved sustainably by 
traditional water management methods, the thinking pattern should be shifted to a 
systematic pattern (Ma et al. 2015). The challenge of urban circularity is related to 
restoring the natural water balance as far as possible (Oral et al. 2021). Further, it 
can be noticed that the NbS has changed its approach to urban water management 
(Tahvonen 2018). Seven challenges have been identifed in managing urban water 
circularly with the use of nature-based solutions, as shown in Fig. 19.2, adopted 
from (Oral et al. 2021).
Among the above challenges, UCC1  – Restoring and Maintaining the Water 
Cycle, UCC2  – Water and waste treatment, recovery and re-use and UCC3  – 
Nutrients recovery and re-use, were considered as the major challenges to be 
addressed within this chapter.
Although natural water fows around the world, the linear way of water manage￾ment affects the quantity and quality of natural water resources (Nancy and Lek 
Kadeli 2012). The existing water distribution method that relies on the local water 
supply systems enables cities to disconnect themselves from the environment 
Fig. 19.2 Challenges in managing urban water circularity with the NbS
19 Nature-Based Solutions for Circular Management of Urban Water in the Built…340
(Wilcox et al. 2016). Wastewater has been treated for an extended period without 
treating for the severe health effects caused and deteriorating water sources (Lofrano 
and Brown 2010). Water supply companies are now considering a circular approach 
to eliminate waste and to manage their resources in a sustainable way. The circular￾ity approach refers to the concept of “end of life” through deliberate re-cycling and 
re-use of materials, products, systems and business models (MacArthur 2013). 
Diverse studies have been carried out on the environmental management of other 
waste streams, such as wastewater (Guerra-Rodríguez et al. 2020) and wastewater 
sludge (Gherghel et al. 2019), towards circularity concepts.
Effective water management has become an essential subject of review since 
“sustainable buildings” have become a prominent topic (Bouwer 2000). For the 
sustainable use of water, Sri Lanka had an excellent village tank cascade system in 
the past. Over time, urbanisation, climate change and growth in population have 
caused the increment in water demand and pollution of existing freshwater resources. 
Various grey, green and blue wastewater treatment systems are used to improve the 
quality of freshwater resources. Recently, a nature-based treatment system has 
received particular attention as a tool to improve water quality in lakes and foating 
wetlands (Jegatheesan et al. 2022). In Sri Lanka, the capital city, Colombo, is facing 
a major water crisis due to the increasing demand and shrinkage of existing natural 
resources (Wickramasinghe 2019). Even though water management has obtained 
some attention, many academics, construction practitioners and government author￾ities are yet to realise the importance of water conservation in the construction sec￾tor, as the priority given is statistically low (Waidyasekara et  al. 2014). Further, 
according to Waidyasekara et al. (2014), many construction activities, while caus￾ing water pollution and environmental damage, use drinking water during construc￾tion processes, which can only be considered as a waste and misuse of water. The 
water management of the Sri Lankan construction industry is at a moderate level, 
and it has been suggested that changes in the behaviour of workers and policies and 
planning to reduce water waste could be a step towards signifcant water effciency 
in construction sites (Waidyasekara et al. 2016).
Hence, this study suggests implementing nature-based solutions in a circular 
manner as an alternative for the prevailing urban water management system in Sri 
Lankan built environment.
19.3 Methodology
This research adopts a qualitative approach to address the objectives of the book 
chapter. Creswell (2014) suggests that a qualitative research approach is suitable for 
exploratory research to gather new knowledge, especially when the phenomena to 
be investigated are unknown or when the literature is not comprehensive enough. As 
the NbS is a relatively new concept in Sri Lanka and there is limited literature 
exploring NbS as a solution for circular urban water management in the built envi￾ronment of Sri Lanka, qualitative research is considered the most suitable approach.
P. Weerakoon and M. Thayaparan341
A comprehensive literature review was carried out to review the use and effec￾tiveness of nature-based solutions for circular management of urban water in the 
built environment in global and Sri Lankan contexts. According to Ritchie et al. 
(2013), qualitative research approaches are ideal for gathering opinions and infor￾mation from people based on their experiences, and are useful for deep analysis of 
the data collected in situations where detailed analysis is required. Accordingly, 
twelve (12) semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners who have experi￾ence of at least 5 years in project management and construction management in 
urban developments were conducted to investigate how NbS contributes to the cir￾cular management of urban water in the built environment in Sri Lanka and to 
develop a pathway to enhance the circular management of urban water in the built 
environment of Sri Lanka using NbS.
Purposive sampling method was used to select the suitable respondents for the 
interviews. Purposive sampling helps the researcher to select the experts in a way 
that will best enable the achievement of the objectives (Saunders et al. 2009). Etikan 
(2016) also mentioned that experts in a particular feld are the subjects of purposive 
sampling. Qualitative content analysis was carried out to analyse the primary data 
gathered through semi-structured interviews. The respondents’ profles of the inter￾viewees are given in Table 19.1.
The number of interviewees was limited to 12 since the study reached data satu￾ration, as there was no new knowledge gathered after the tenth interviewee. 
According to O’Reilly & Parker 2013, data saturation is achieved when enough

information is available to reproduce the study. Koelsch 2013 has stated that “mem￾ber checking” has been announced as a key component of quality research valida￾tion. Hence, as the fnal step of this study, member-checking was carried out to 
validate the primary data by getting the gathered data confrmed by all the inter￾viewees. The following section discusses the results of the data analysis.
19.4 Results and Discussion
19.4.1 Signifcance for Managing Urban Water 
in the Sri Lankan Built Environment
The means of major water-consuming activities for building and infrastructure proj￾ects were identifed as shown in Table 19.2.
The respondents highlighted that for infrastructure projects such as road, bridges 
and culverts, water consumption is comparatively higher than building projects, 
especially for dust controlling and embankment compaction in road projects. 
Further, the respondents indicated that the water consumed for concrete mixing is 
generally the highest usage for any construction.
A common view of the respondents was that water management in the Sri Lankan 
construction industry is not a priority even though water has been used in the con￾struction sector in major. One major concern regarding water usage in infrastructure 
projects as expressed by participants was using freshwater or potable water for most 
of the cleaning and compaction works, especially in road projects. In some events, 
“water used for cleaning works will be disposed to the nearby lake or river harming 
the natural water cycle and polluting the water resource” [R01, R06].
Further, few respondents emphasised that the methods of using water resources 
depend on the location of the construction project, the type of construction and 
sometimes on the stakeholder requirements. Most respondents mentioned that “for 
infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, highways and airports, natural water 
resources like rivers, lakes and canals will be used to facilitate water for 
construction”[R01-R05, R08, R9-R11]. On the other hand, respondents who are 
specialised in building projects mentioned that, for most of the building projects in 
urban areas, water is provided by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board

(NWSDB). However, there are instances where the water for large-scale urban 
building projects were extracted from the nearest natural water reservoir due to vari￾ous reasons such as cost, high demand, and inadequate supply from local water 
supply systems.
All respondents indicated that water resource is essential for all kinds of 
construction works in Sri Lanka. Further, they highlighted the necessity of man￾aging water resources in the Sri Lankan built environment, especially in urban 
areas. Uninterrupted water supply for large-scale urban projects has been a chal￾lenge in Sri Lanka, as there were frequent interruptions for water supply due to 
high demand and low water levels due to insuffcient rainfall [R03, R06, 
R07, R08].
Most of the respondents indicated that there has been no proper water manage￾ment strategy implemented at the construction sites to manage urban water effec￾tively. Accordingly, all respondents unanimously agreed that managing urban water 
in the Sri Lankan built environment has become necessary.
19.4.2 The Practice of Nature-Based Solutions in the Built 
Environment in Sri Lanka
The literature review indicates that nature-based solutions are vitally practised in 
the built environment globally. On the contrary, the standard viewpoint amongst 
the interview participants was that the practice of NbS is not familiar when it 
comes to Sri Lankan built environment. As mentioned by R01, the main reason for 
not practicing NbS in the Sri Lankan built environment is Sri Lanka receives 
adequate rainfalls from four monsoons in different time periods, such as First 
inter-monsoon season (March–April), Southwest monsoon season (May–
September), Second inter-monsoon season (October–November), Northern mon￾soon season (December–February) [REF], the respondents highlighted this as one 
of the main reasons for not practising NbS in Sri Lankan built environment. 
Further, respondents stated that when there is a considerable water demand for 
construction in urban areas, the frst and the most cost-effective method practised 
is “extracting from a nearest natural water reservoir or a human-built reservoir”. 
Hence, water supply has not become a problem due to the natural rivers and 
human-built reservoirs. However, due to climate change, the weather patterns of 
all over the world, including Sri Lanka have become unpredictable (Esham et al. 
2018). Sri Lanka has evidently suffered from severe drought seasons since 2018 
(Alahacoon et al. 2021). As such the respondents emphasised that it is high time 
to consider nature-based solutions to ensure the urban water supply and manage￾ment for the Sri Lankan built environment. Approximately two-thirds of the par￾ticipants mentioned that practice of nature-based solutions depends on many 
considerations such as location of the construction project, material availability, 
geographical aspects, etc.

19.4.3 Effectiveness of Practicing Nature-Based Solutions 
in the Sri Lankan Built Environment
All the respondents highlighted that material prices are increasing vastly due to the 
scarcity of natural resources and due to the economic recession in the country. 
Hence, implementing NbS for circular water management in the construction indus￾try might give both economic and environmental benefts in Sri Lanka. Respondents 
stated that these economic benefts should be highlighted and educated in the indus￾try to promote the implementation of NbS in construction. R10 and R11 stated that 
in the path of moving towards circular cities, managing water in urban areas like 
Colombo is essential since water consumption by the built environment is high 
compared to other industries. Implementing NbS in the built environment in Sri 
Lanka will help protect the natural reservoirs and other natural water sources and 
minimise the harm towards the natural water cycle.
It was mentioned by the respondents that there are limitations in the built envi￾ronment for the implementation of circular water management through nature-based 
solutions. The circular management of water in construction activities is not possi￾ble at some instances where water is consumed as a construction material. Water is 
used as a major material for many construction activities such as to mix cement sand 
mortar, mixing concrete, mixing paint, etc. Hence there is no possibility of re-using 
or re-cycling the water which is used up as a construction material.
R01, R02, R05 and R07 confrmed that, in order to maintain the structural prop￾erties and the quality of the elements, use of water at the required quality is essen￾tial. While the respondents agree that water re-cycling is essential to manage urban 
water circularity, due to the high costs for water re-cycling, the construction indus￾try is reluctant to adopt that system. To further clarify this point R11 and R12 who 
have more than 10 years of experience working in the water supply sector, quoted 
the “ARU PLANT”, which was installed in Vavuniya for water treatment, as a good 
example to get an idea about the cost of water treatment. According to them, “This 
plant was initially introduced to treat groundwater but, due to the high cost of treat￾ing the groundwater, people have started treating seawater using this method for 
drinking purposes” [R11, R12].
The following section explores the barriers identifed in implementing circular 
water management using NbS in the Sri Lankan built environment.
19.4.4 Barriers Towards Implementing NbS in Circular Water 
Management in SL
The barriers related to the implementation of NbS identifed through the literature 
have been contextualised to the Sri Lankan built environment. Accordingly, the key 
barriers were identifed as inadequate fnancial resources, performance uncertainty, 
uncertainty in the implementation process of NbS, high costs and inadequate 
regulations.
P. Weerakoon and M. Thayaparan345
Having confrmed the above barriers from the literature, the respondents have 
also revealed additional barriers in the context of the Sri Lankan built environment, 
as briefy discussed below. One main concern is the not realisation of the problem 
of water scarcity by the citizens and the government of Sri Lanka. Due to the envi￾ronmentally unfriendly activities done by humankind over many years, it is well 
known that there is a massive impact on the natural cycles. Several other countries 
such as Singapore (Lewis 2013) are giving priority to fnd solutions for the water 
scarcity problem. But in Sri Lanka, people have unfortunately not started thinking 
of this water scarcity problem; hence the water management sector is at an infant 
stage compared to other countries in the world. Lack of awareness of new concepts 
and techniques such as NbS, circularity, etc. at the industry level is another major 
barrier identifed by the majority of the respondents for implementing NbS to treat 
the urban water in Sri Lankan built environment. Besides, most industry practitio￾ners wish to practice the same conventional methods that they have been practising 
for years and are reluctant to change and move forward with new concepts and 
technologies. As such the knowledge and the attitude of the industry practitioners 
largely contribute to ineffective implementation of NbS for circular urban water 
management in the built environment in Sri Lanka. The limited capacity of industry 
stakeholders, especially those at small and medium scales, was highlighted as an 
obstacle for the effective implementation of a new concept. In Sri Lanka, most of 
these latest technologies and new methods are usually practised by major contrac￾tors, whereas small- and medium-scale contractors have limited knowledge, human 
resource and fnancial capacity to practice such new developments. On the other 
hand, respondents with experience working for the client highlighted that most cli￾ents are strict on the budget and, according to their perspective, no client would like 
to invest on a new concept without knowing the beneft in return.
The respondents further claim that there is a mismatch of knowledge and aware￾ness between the construction organisations, construction sites and academic institu￾tions. Fostering collaboration between industry and academia is therefore essential. In 
addition, the initiative to implement NbS should come from or be supported by the 
government, in order to fully realise the benefts of such an initiative by the industry. 
The respondents highlighted that the government should work towards uplifting the 
nation’s three-dimensional aspects such as Social, Environment and Economic to 
achieve sustainability. However, there is lack of government involvement towards 
such implementation in Sri Lanka which acts as a major barrier.
19.5 Framework to the Pathway for Circular Urban 
Water Management
The existing practices in the Sri Lankan built environment in terms of usage of 
urban water, the sources of supply and disposal of wastewater are depicted in 
Fig. 19.3. It clearly shows that there is no re-use or re-cycling done at the end of the 
disposal stage.

Fig. 19.3 Existing practices related to water used for urban projects
Fig. 19.4 Proposed pathway for circular urban water management in the Sri Lankan built 
environment
Based on the research conducted, this chapter suggests a pathway for circularly 
managing urban water using NbS in the Sri Lankan built environment. The pro￾posed pathway provides comprehensive facts and cost-effective solutions for the 
identifed barriers via interviews conducted with industry practitioners as illustrated 
in Fig. 19.4.
The proposed water management pathway suggests re-using wastewater and 
stormwater from urban projects. The principal objective of this pathway is to reduce 
one of the mainly discussed barriers during the interviews with industry experts, 
which is “Uncertainty in the implementation process”. Moreover, the proposed 
pathway consists of factors such as: restore, re-cycle and re-use. This pathway has 
been suggested as a combination of NbS and traditional methods. This pathway 
aims explicitly at highly urbanised areas in Sri Lanka, such as Colombo city. Hence 
implementing NbS independently in highly urbanised areas is not possible, and the 
P. Weerakoon and M. Thayaparan347
main challenge is to restore the natural cycles and re-use them as far as possible. In 
the suggested pathway, the maximum amount of water is added back to the water 
cycle after removing all the pollutants.
Practical application of the proposed pathway is advisable in urban areas and for 
building and infrastructure projects. Further research will be recommended to iden￾tify a business model based on the pathway suggested by this paper to convince the 
investors by highlighting the economic benefts of this concept. Before implement￾ing this pathway, it is recommended to conduct some brainstorming sessions for the 
stakeholders involved in this process to ensure they understand the whole process.
19.6 Conclusion and Recommendations
Nature-based solution is a novel concept practised in the built environment over a 
considerable period. The concept of nature-based solutions (NbS) is a crucial theme 
of modern research about more sustainable urban and rural development. The NbS 
has been proposed as an essential opportunity for adapting to climate change, attain￾ing goals towards sustainable development and, more generally, creating a better 
future for nature and people. The built environment can be seen as one of the major 
industries that has a negative impact on the environment, as the construction indus￾try consumes an immense amount of natural resources for various kinds of activi￾ties. Among these natural resources, the water consumption of the construction 
industry is an essential factor. Hence, water management in the built environment 
has become one of the frequent topics for discussion by academia. This framework 
recommends managing urban water within the urban context using re-cycle and re￾use concepts. Moreover, this framework suggests releasing a considerable amount 
of water after recovering its nutrients back to water bodies obeying the NbS con￾cept. This recommended pathway will signifcantly impact the circular city concept 
in Sri Lanka.

The Hydraulic Approach Relevant 
to Circularity on Sustainable Water 
Catchment
Tevk Denizhan Muftuoglu and Hasan Volkan Oral
Abstract We live in an era where it is quite difcult to track brisk growth in a vari￾ety of elds, such as engineering, articial intelligence, space exploration, and 
industry. Although the rapid pace of advancements brings numerous advantages, 
there are some controversial thoughts against these advantages that arise from time 
to time. For instance, while the improvements in health infrastructure and ongoing 
medical achievements decrease the mortality levels even in less-developed coun￾tries, some circles on the other hand claim that due to the rapid increment of the 
population, the earth will not be able to survive much longer considering the boost￾ing demand, since it does not have eternal natural resources. One of these scarce 
natural resources is water, and it is the most vital. Therefore, rational usage of water 
possesses continuous interest, and it is dependent on the concept of circularity and 
sustainability where drawing water from its natural cycle and efcient usage create 
its foundation. Additionally, even though sustainability and circularity are fre￾quently seen as interchangeable concepts, not all circularity strategies are sustain￾able. For instance, the recycling of plastic bottles from bottled water contributes to 
the circular economy. However, environmental hazards such as pollution and emis￾sion during the production process, the use of plants on fertile land, and additional 
emissions from the shipping of plastic bottles to recycling facilities cause them to 
fall short of the sustainability concept.
In this book chapter, a water catchment system that considers both circularity 
and sustainability is briey explained by implementing an engineering perspective 
where the main principles of hydraulics and hydrology are taken into account as 
indisputable facts for drinking and irrigation purposes.

20.1 Introduction
A circular economy (CE) model maximizes the services produced by the linear 
nature-society-nature material and energy throughput fow. It is an economy built 
from societal production-consumption systems. Utilizing cyclical material fuxes, 
renewable energy sources, and cascading energy fow types enables this. A success￾ful CE contributes to each of the three pillars of sustainable development (SD) 
(Korhonen et  al. 2018). SD presents the solution strategies for the continuous 
demand for accessing reliable and safe water both for small-scale house needs and 
for irrigation has become an important issue due to the unpreventable progress of 
pollution that occurs on water resources. Even though precautions are being taken 
to prevent or at least minimize the hazardous effects of pollution in water resources, 
unfortunately, these precaution steps are not at the desired levels. For this reason, to 
provide good quality water, the number of large-scale rehabilitation (e.g., fltering, 
reverse osmosis, multi-stage fash distillation) facilities take water from natural 
resources such as springs, rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans, or artifcial water catch￾ment structures such as man-made ponds are increasing. However, while these facil￾ities provide diverse benefts for the usage of people, they also present side effects 
and major drawbacks. The production of non-biodegradable polymers, massive 
annual power consumption of the machinery in the facilities, compensating for that 
consumption with pollution-producing coal and natural gas-based power plants, and 
increased costs associated with pump systems for transporting water from remote 
areas to residences are a few examples of the side effects. Thus, small-scale residen￾tial water catchment facilities should be considered in light of all of these 
disadvantages.
In this book chapter, an introduction to convenient household water catchment 
facility construction is explained by fortifying the construction stages with basic 
hydraulic principles.
Therefore, a general view of the household water catchment application based on 
the hydraulic approach, the equipment of the water catchment system, and the 
installation of the water catchment system are briefy presented.
20.2 Hydraulic Design of Water Catchment System
20.2.1 Determination of the Catchment Potential
Determination of rainwater potential is vital for a water catchment (rainwater har￾vesting) system. Knowing the potential and deciding whether constructing the sys￾tem would be functioning or feasible are the frst two steps before starting the 
project. The potential (Pot) in mm3
 is calculated by a simple method which is the 
multiplication of available area to collect rainwater (A) in mm2
 and annual precipita￾tion (P) in mm.
T. D. Muftuoglu and H. V. Oral355
Pot   A P (20.1)
While the Eq. 20.1 for calculating the rainwater harvesting potential seems simple, 
unlike the area (A) parameter which can be adjusted by the engineer, annual precipi￾tation (P) cannot be manipulated or embraced the same for different areas. In terms 
of functionality and feasibility as stated above, the design of the harvesting system 
can only be performed according to the authentic values, and it is not possible to 
achieve meticulous predictions based on these values which are only recorded for a 
few years or are only recorded for a certain city or region. It is important to under￾line that even if the locations are close to each other, the variation in precipitation 
amount can be quite remarkable. For instance, three different cities in Turkey are 
presented in terms of their annual precipitation amount (mm), and air distances 
between each other are presented in Table 20.1.
As seen from Table  20.1, even though the period for province of Muğla is 
10 years longer than province of İzmir and 13 years longer than province of Aydın, 
the remarkable difference related to precipitation amount cannot be linked to these 
years. The average annual precipitation amount doubles only within 85 kilometers 
when provinces of Muğla and Aydın are compared to each other. The locations of 
these three cities are shown in Figs. 20.1 and 20.2.
Therefore, to obtain robust data for the annual precipitation (P), a large number 
of precipitation history records must be collected considering the location to accu￾rately determine the volumetric fow rate of harvested water used through the house￾hold utilities. Precipitation history records with designated locations can easily be 
obtained from the data that is provided by government agencies.
Roofs of buildings could be designed as catchment areas quite easily. For a sim￾ple independent house with a square plan with dimensions of 10 m, the design of an 
A-Frame roof is presented in Fig. 20.3, based on planned areas zoning regulation of 
Turkey (Ministry of Environment 2022). The roof height is taken as 2.5 m, the roof 
eave is selected as 1 m long, and the roof slope is arranged with a degree of 23°. One 
side of the A-Frame roof has an area of approximately 96 m2
, and the total area of 
the presented roof is considered roughly 200 m2
. The water catchment, or in other 
words, the rainwater harvesting potential is determined based on this simple 
approach.
For instance, if a single building, an independent home from the province of 
Muğla is considered, and rainwater is going to be harvested throughout a year by the 
water catchment area of that building (E.g. 200 m2
 roof), water catchment potential

In 2020, according to the report of the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT), 
in water abstraction per capita in the municipalities section, an average of 383 lt/
capita. day of water was drawn in the province of Muğla (Turkish Statistical Institute 
2022), and the population of the city was 1,000,773 (Turkish Statistical Institute 
2021). Based on these values, roughly (0.383  m3
/cap￾ita × day) × 1000773 × 365 = 1.4 × 108
 m3
/year of water for drinking and usage 
purposes was drawn.
Unfortunately, there are not any offcial statistics representing the type of resi￾dential buildings separately (independent homes or apartment fats). The total num￾ber of residential buildings in Turkey (both independent homes and apartments) was 
39 million by the end of September 2020 (Presidential Annual Program of Turkey 
2021), whereas the population of Turkey at the same time was 83.6 million (Turkish 
Statistical Institute 2021). By underlining the drawbacks of the proposed correla￾tion, it can be roughly said that the number of residential buildings in the province 
of Muğla by the end of September 2020 could be assumed as 
(39/83.6) × 1000773 = 466868 in proportion to its population.
While 80% of Turkey’s population lives in apartments, the province of Muğla 
mostly contains independent homes due to its summerhouses for holidays (the city 
offers numerous summer activities with its bays, lakes, beaches, etc.) and also due 
to its traditions (e.g., architecture, and land availability). Therefore, the percentage 
of independent homes in this city is higher than the general average in Turkey. 
Nevertheless, the worst scenario that is against our favor in terms of the water catch￾ment potential of the city will be considered, to show the importance of the water 
catchment systems and show how proftable they can be. Since the number of inde￾pendent homes where the water catchment systems are applied on the roofs increases 
the water catchment potential also increases, and as stated above even though inde￾pendent houses are more common in the province of Muğla against the general situ￾ation of Turkey. Keeping the percentage of independent homes in the province of 
Muğla the same as Turkey’s overall percentage, the so-called worst scenario appears. 
In the fnal statement, the number of independent homes in the province of Muğla 
corresponds to 466868 × 20 %  = 93374 in the year 2020.
As stated before, if approximately 200 m2
 catchment area for each building were 
considered in the year 2020, 2.42 × 102
m3
/year × 93374 = 2.25  × 107
m3
/year of 
water could be harvested and stored from the entire independent buildings located 
at the province of Muğla. Based on the drawn water, the annual household water 
demand of the whole city for drinking and usage purposes was 1.4 × 108
 m3
 in the 
year 2020. Therefore, the rainwater harvesting approach applied only to the stated 
number of independent houses would correspond to 16% of total usage in a year 
consumed by all houses (independent homes and apartment fats combined). 
Fulflling most of the water usage can be increased by preferring different kinds of 
roof types where they have larger areas such as hip and valley roofs, also it is not 
impossible if larger-scale water catchment infrastructures independent of individual 
installations are constructed, but in this text, they are not investigated.
20 The Hydraulic Approach Relevant to Circularity on Sustainable Water Catchment358
The effciency of the stated individual water catchment application in terms of 
future water demand predictions can also be considered. For this reason, to analyze 
the effectiveness of individual water catchment systems, well-known methods such 
as the arithmetic increment method, geometric increment method, Ilbank method, 
and logistic curve method, to forecast the future population of the city are used.
According to the Ilbank method (ILBANK n.d.), the projection of the population 
is calculated as:

If the population projection is performed for the same city, province of Muğla, 
for the populations of 2000 (pop. 715,328) (Turkish Statistical Institute 2000), and 
2020 (pop. 1,000,773) (Turkish Statistical Institute 2021), the population in 2040 is 
predicted as 1,400,122.
The estimated number for the year 2040 shows that the increase in population in 
the province of Muğla is expected to be around 40% in 20 years. At the same time, 
average water consumption can be roughly calculated by multiplying the average 
consumption per capita. day with the population. As was stated before, in 2020 an 
average of 383 lt/capita. day of water was drawn in the province of Muğla (Turkish 
Statistical Institute 2022) corresponding to approximately 1.4  ×  108
 m3
/year. 
However, water consumption amounts can vary based on many factors such as 
short-term effects of climate change, changes in regulations and prices, and improve￾ments in technology for household items that consume water. Therefore, the multi￾plication of current water consumption with the forecasted population will not 
present the reality. Detailed forecasting scenario for future water consumption esti￾mation, such as using statistical analysis, and artifcial intelligence/machine 
learning-based approaches, is required. Numerous studies take attention to the rapid 
growth of water consumption to point out what kind of bitter consequences will be 
faced in the future by doing statistical analyses. For example, it is stated that the 
demand for food growing, and the increment in living standards during the last 
100 years resulted in an almost 6 times increment in water usage, and it keeps going 
T. D. Muftuoglu and H. V. Oral359
on (Wada et al. 2016). Nevertheless, even under these conditions, by keeping opti￾mistic, the increase of water consumption per capita. day in percentage is assumed 
as 50 worldwide for the year 2040, then the daily water demand per person in the 
province of Muğla would be 575 lt/capita. day, if the same percentage is accepted 
for the province of Muğla, it would correspond to approximately (0.575 m3
/cap￾ita × day) × 1400122 × 365 = 2.94 × 108
 m3
/year of water for drinking and usage 
purposes to be drawn.
If the water catchment potential for the province of Muğla once again is recalled, 
a building with a 200 m2
 roof area would store 2.4 × 102
m3
/year of water with only 
one house. The number of independent homes was roughly calculated as 93.324 in 
the year 2020. Since a 20-year time interval is selected for the forecasting of popula￾tion, similarly, the number of houses should have also been forecasted for 20 years 
later. As it is stated for the forecasting of water consumption, similarly detailed 
forecasting methods need to be applied in terms of predicting the number of inde￾pendent homes. These forecasting methods require complex studies built on solid 
foundations. Nonetheless, the main purpose of this study is to give an idea of the 
importance of water catchment systems. For this reason, precise statistical analysis 
is not covered up, and by adopting a simple arithmetic increment approach, it is 
assumed that the increment rate for independent houses in 20 years (2000–2020) 
has occurred to 220% since the number of buildings in the province of Muğla was 
194,620 in the year 2000 that corresponds to 29.190 independent homes, and in the 
year of 2020, the number of independent homes was 93.324. When the same incre￾ment rate is applied, the number of independent houses can be expected as 29.8637 in 
the year 2040. Since the province of Muğla is a city that offers exceptional vacation 
activities compared to all other countries, as was already mentioned, it is largely tied 
to the unique qualities of the city, which encourages people to acquire summer￾houses and the development of new independent homes. In this case, harvesting 
potential from the individual water catchment area of independent homes is fore￾casted as 298637 × 2.4 × 102
m3
/year = 7.2 × 107
m3
/year, and it still can fulfll 25% 
of drawn water in 2040. Another important point is that these simple calculations 
are performed only for independent homes as it is stated. When the same catchment 
area is applied onto each apartment’s roof, an additional potential that satisfes more 
than 30% of the drawn water can easily be considered.
20.2.2 General View of the Water Catchment System
Water catchment systems can be designed for various house types, e.g., private 
homes or apartments, and also housing development areas (where identical or simi￾lar private homes are located in a housing estate). For a housing development area, 
a relatively larger-scale system can be constructed by considering shared equipment 
to minimize private land occupation. Here, only the independent catchment systems 
are considered. An example of a typical independent home is simply drawn and 
presented in Fig.  20.4, and the brief explanation of the working principle of a

small-scale household water catchment system both for home appliances, drinking 
purposes, and garden irrigation is schematically presented in Fig. 20.5.
To have more insight, a closer look at the water catchment system is presented in 
Fig. 20.6.
20.3 Elements of the Water Catchment System
20.3.1 The Roof
The process of catching water starts at the roof. In this stage, the importance of roof￾ing material has to be considered. To get the most out of the rain and maximize 
water quality, if possible, metal roofs should be preferred instead of wood or tile 
shingles, since the gaps between shingle parts are suitable places for grime and dirt 
T. D. Muftuoglu and H. V. Oral361

accumulation. Also, to overcome rust and corrosion, painted metals should be pre￾ferred. There are also other materials such as asphalt shingles, but they can be haz￾ardous, because such materials release chemical substances over time, and these 
substances are transferred into the water which is planned to be used even for drink￾ing. No matter how developed fltering systems are used, there is still a great pos￾sibility to contaminate water with chemicals that result in chemical pollution in 
water and decrease its quality (Figs. 20.7, 20.8, and 20.9).

Fig. 20.9 An example of Terracotta roof. (Sunbeam Photography n.d.)
20.3.2 The Gutter
The journey of water after it hits the roof continues through the gutter. The size of 
the gutter is an important parameter in terms of handling the amount of water that 
comes from the roof, which is called runoff, during heavy precipitations (Fig. 20.10).
T. D. Muftuoglu and H. V. Oral363
Fig. 20.10 An example of gutter. (Lachlan n.d.)
20.3.3 The Leaf Screen
Another consideration for the gutter is the accumulation of debris such as leaves, 
dust, and grime. As the accumulation occurs in the gutter, the debris can easily fow 
through the downspout and may clog it. Therefore, a simple device called a leaf 
screen is used to prevent the debris to fall into the downspout pipe. Inside the leaf 
screen, another mesh flters even smaller particles. A simple drawing of a leaf screen 
is presented in Fig. 20.11.
20.3.4 The First Flush Diverter
Although the leaf screen catches the leaves, chunks, debris, etc., there are still con￾taminants in the water. Therefore, after the downspout that curves through the tank, 
there is another facility that is called the frst fush diverter. Polluted water that starts 
from the roof and fows through the downspout and the leaf screen, falls into the frst 
fush before it arrives at the tank. In this way, any material that could not have been 
captured by the leaf screen and is heavier than the water goes down through the pipe 
of the frst fush diverter, and transportation of cleaner water to the tank is achieved. 
A simple drawing of the frst fush diverter is presented in Fig. 20.12.
The working principle of the frst fush diverter is simple, yet effective. When the 
water enters the inlet pipe of the frst fush diverter, it falls into the vertical pipe of 
20 The Hydraulic Approach Relevant to Circularity on Sustainable Water Catchment364
Fig. 20.11 A simple 
drawing of a leaf screen
Fig. 20.12 A simple drawing of a frst fush diverter
the system as stated above. In the vertical pipe, there is a ball valve, and as the water 
flls the pipe, it lifts the ball. When the ball reaches the top which shows the chamber 
is full, it seals the pipe, prevents dirty water escape from the vertical pipe, and joins 
the main pipe fow which is on its way to the tank. The time for the ball reaches to 
the top is more than enough to get rid of the dirtiness of the frst fush from the roof, 
which means most of the dirt is already in the vertical pipe, and ongoing rain will 
bring quite clean water. The captured water in the vertical pipe defnitely must be 
T. D. Muftuoglu and H. V. Oral365
evacuated. For this reason, a slow-release valve or any attachment with the same 
kind of purpose such as an irrigation tip can be attached, and the dirty water may be 
used for the irrigation of plants which can be described as rich in nutrition due to the 
fertilizer-like structures of leaves. With the slow-release valve or irrigation tip, the 
frst fush diverter is reset between rains. The continuous fow of rainwater will 
never be 100% pure without mechanical and chemical treatment, but the increment 
in its water quality will be quite remarkable. There are tons of fltering, desalination, 
and purifcation processes that can make the water almost 100% pure, and the pre￾sented water catchment method can always be improved.
20.3.5 The Tank and Related Components (Vent, Overfow, 
and Outlet)
Tanks are the responsible part for storing the water. They can be made out of various 
materials such as plastic, concrete, metal, etc. All tanks have numerous required 
components regardless of their materials.
If the infow pipe of the tank is not counted as essential, since without it there 
will be no transportation of water into the tank, the frst required component is the 
access port for maintenance purposes. With that access port, important procedures, 
such as cleaning and repairing, are performed from time to time.
The second one is the ventilation opening, and it is based on the simple fuid 
mechanics aspect. As the water flls the tank and the water inside the tank is evacu￾ated from the tank, vacuuming may occur, and this vacuum can easily implode 
the tank.
The third one is the overfow opening. An overfow pipe with an identical size of 
infow pipe or bigger is required to keep the tank safe against the internal pressure 
of the stored water in case of heavy rain that easily flls the tank up. Also, the over￾fow part can be attached to an adjacent tank or adjacent tanks to increase the amount 
of stored water. Additionally, without the overfow, during the excessive amount of 
precipitation, water that is stored in the tank may pour out of the vent.
The fourth component is the actual component that is responsible for the distri￾bution or usage of the stored water. It is called the outlet. If a water catchment sys￾tem is not planned for household usage, just a simple hose that is attached to the 
outlet can be used for irrigation, or there are numerous irrigation systems (sprin￾klers, drip irrigation) that can be connected to the outlet with pumping facilities.
If a pump is attached to the outlet to satisfy the required water for the household 
needs, then the related parameters of the pump must be considered. Elaborate cal￾culations for the pumping systems will not be presented here, but the background 
will be given. The fundamental idea behind suitable pump selection lies in the accu￾rate calculation of the operating pressure of the system. Therefore, a suitable pump 
will be selected to beat the operating pressure. Because moving the fuid at the 
desired fow rate can only be achieved by overcoming the operating pressure of the 
system. The operating pressure is simply a function of pipe properties, and main 
20 The Hydraulic Approach Relevant to Circularity on Sustainable Water Catchment366
physical principles such as length and diameter of the pipe and its fttings, and pos￾sible liquid elevation. Therefore, to satisfy the operating pressure, the power of the 
pump should be accurately estimated since pumps consume power, and in this way, 
the pressure of a fuid is increased. Three kinds of powers can be named to deter￾mine the overall power of the pump. The frst one is hydraulic power. It is the power 
that expresses energy conveyed on the transported fuid by the pump to enhance its 
pressure, and also its velocity. The hydraulic power calculation is presented in 
Eqs. 20.5 and 20.6 as:

dP: Pressure difference.
The second one is the shaft power. It is the power transmitted from the motor to 
the pump shaft where power loss occurs during the transmission, and is obtained by 
dividing the hydraulic power with pump effciency, ηpump, which is shown in 
Eq. 20.7 as:

where

ηpump: Pump effciency.
The third and the last one is the motor power. It is the power that the motor of the 
pump consumes to rotate the pump shaft whereas also power loss occurs during the 
conversion of electric to kinetic energy. Similarly, it is obtained by dividing the shaft 
power with motor effciency, ηmotor, which is shown in Eq. 20.8 as:

There are also other factors such as variable speed, belt drives, and gearboxes 
that particularly increase the power supplied by the motor. Besides relatively com￾plex hydraulic and mechanical calculations, fundamental factors to be considered 
before installing a pump at the outlet are expressed in a practical way for the home￾owners below.
The frst factor that must be considered is the traveling distance of the water from 
the tank to the home. It may be based on the distance from the tank to home or the 
number of stories and requires detailed calculations. As mentioned, in terms of 
practical ways, a pump with a head pressure between 30 and 50 m, which means the 
ability to lift fuid 30–50 m vertically, will mostly be suffcient for a multi-story 
building. Occasionally, pump manufacturers indicate on a label attached to the 
pump or in a catalog that shows buildings with different numbers of stories.
The second factor that must be considered is the water pressure. The water pres￾sure is the dependent parameter for most household items, and also it is quite impor￾tant for the comfort of people living in the same house. For instance, a modern 
dishwasher may require a certain level of water pressure to operate, otherwise, it 
may not work at all, or sprinklers in the garden may not perform effectively due to 
the low water pressure. In addition, a person that lives in a house may not be able to 
take a shower while another person turns on the tap just for washing his/her hands. 
Water pressure is usually expressed by liters per minute in terms of fow rate. 
Therefore, by adding all pressure requirements of the facilities in case they operate 
at the same time, the required total fow rate can be achieved, and the selection of 
the pump can be performed according to that value.
The third factor that must be considered is energy usage. Picking a pump whose 
power is more than enough will not bring any beneft, and instead, it will increase 
the electricity cost, since pumps consume electricity to draw energy. Besides the 
negative effect on the bill, there will be also a negative effect on the environment. 
The purpose was harvesting and storing water to increase the positive impacts of 
sustainability and circularity on the environment, not spending the resources of the 
earth unnecessarily. Therefore, detailed calculations are required.
The fourth and the last ones in a practical way are more related to comfort. As the 
pumps operate, since they contain motors, they emit sound. Most of the time that 
sound is considered noise due to continuous operation. There are methods to 
decrease the noise level of pumps such as covering or putting them in a casing. 
Noise levels of pumps are indicated in the technical notes by the manufacturer. 
Therefore, the house owner can also consider the noise level along with the other 
properties before purchase.
Other than the hydraulic aspects of tanks, the physical and chemical conditions 
of them also need to be considered to re-use the harvested water employing quality. 
The material in which the tank is made must provide durability against harsh envi￾ronmental conditions such as humidity and the effects of sunlight. If the tank cannot 
20 The Hydraulic Approach Relevant to Circularity on Sustainable Water Catchment368
resist the stated conditions that may cause deformations, e.g., tears and cracks, it 
may lose its ability to isolate the stored water from outer effects that may pave the 
way for the entrance of small animals such as amphibians and rodents. The reason 
for attaching screens at outlets, outfows, and pipes is also for preventing small ani￾mals and insects to enter the tank. At the same time, inner effects, mostly chemical 
and biological, must be taken into account to minimize unwanted situations, for 
instance, the accumulation of mold, algae, and other creatures directly affects the 
water quality. There are different precautions to prohibit the stated negative aspects, 
but they are not in the scope of this book chapter. However, to give the fundamen￾tals, it can be said that simply the tanks with a dark color or opaque texture provide 
important assistance to limit the growth of algae. In conclusion, tanks must endure 
both outer and inner effects by possessing high physical, mechanical, and chemical 
properties.
Even though all necessary protections are taken into account, still other problems 
occur inside the tank that can easily decrease the effciency of water harvesting. One 
of them is the sludge accumulation at the bottom of the tank over time. When this 
accumulation occurs, the effciency of the outlet drastically decreases since it clogs 
the way water passes through the outlet. Therefore, it is important to place the outlet 
above the sludge layer. On the other hand, it has been offered to put the outlet at the 
very bottom location, even lower than the sludge layer, and the sludge will come out 
of the tank incrementally, and will not build up. This may be considered a method 
but, it also increases the chances of clogging the outlet, especially sprinklers if 
attached to the outlet. Also, sludge is the archenemy of important structures such as 
pipe joints, tees, and fttings. Another way to decrease the effects of sludge accumu￾lation is by increasing the length of the inlet pipe that comes after the frst fush 
diverter, through the very bottom of the tank by leaving a small gap. In this way, it 
is aimed to minimize the disturbance of the sludge layer with the hydrodynamic 
force of harvested water that arrives at the tank through the inlet pipe.
20.4 Conclusions
The demand for accessing clean water resources becomes crucial day by day as the 
population growth increases dramatically. There are various methods to satisfy the 
water needs of the humankind, but not all of them provide drinkable water. One of 
the recently favored methods is the rainwater harvesting, which also enables to 
embed circularity and sustainability perspectives. In this study, attention was sought 
for the rainwater harvesting method. For this purpose, the rainwater harvesting 
method that can be easily applied to private houses is expressed by presenting its 
working principle briefy with the required main equipment and their components 
in the framework of hydraulics and sustainability. A project city, province of Muğla/
Turkey, was selected. The reason behind this selection is based on the socio-cultural 
and available building stock characteristics of the city. The most common housing 
type in the city is either single-story or double-story buildings which makes it easier 
T. D. Muftuoglu and H. V. Oral369
to adopt individual rainwater harvesting systems on the rooftops. Then, hydrologi￾cal parameters of the city were collected to determine the effciency of possible 
rainwater harvesting design. For this reason, an analysis was conducted on hydro￾logical parameters, and the simplest roof design capable of harvesting rainwater 
was examined using straightforward calculations. The calculations also involved 
predictions in terms of population to verify whether the designed harvesting system 
meets the demand requirements or not. For this purpose, a correlation proposed by 
a state-owned development and investment bank of Turkey (ILBANK) was used. By 
applying the stated rainwater harvesting method, which was simple enough to be 
considered household equipment, almost one-quarter of annual water consumption 
in an individual house can easily be met with a simple A-Frame-shaped roof that 
had a 200 m2
 surface area. It was also stated that the percentage tends to increase 
swiftly based on the small yet effective changes applied to the roof structure (e.g., 
expanding the dimensions, adopting various roof types). The increment in harvest￾ing capabilities was prone to satisfy the complete demand in the future even though 
the population increases since the increment in the number of houses had exponen￾tial growth on generated harvest if compared to population increment. Transportation 
of harvested rainwater from tank to house using pumping systems was presented by 
practical pumping calculations. Besides the hydraulics point of view, the benefts of 
the presented system instead of commonly available water supply methodologies 
were explained. Therefore, especially for domestic water usage, negative aspects of 
the widely used supplying techniques on the environment were highlighted.

Abstract Nigeria and several developing nations have been faced with myriads of 
natural hazards such as oods amongst others which are attributable to both natural 
and anthropogenic factors. The design of structural systems for the control and pre￾vention of these hazards has relied greatly on using rigid linings for hydraulic struc￾tures due to the ease of construction and maintenance. These systems, however, 
have negative implications on the environment necessitating exploration of nature￾based solutions. This study therefore designed a concrete-lined trapezoidal channel 
and a natural-lined trapezoidal channel for the management of ood in Bulbula, 
Kano, Nigeria. Flow through both channels was simulated in HEC-RAS.  While 
both channels showed adequacy in controlling the ood, the natural channel with a 
normalized relative score of 1 was better than the concrete-lined channel with a 
score of 0.7. The study concluded that the nature-based channels should be explored 
in urban drainages if the space is available.

21.1 Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are global goals for achieving environ￾mental and human development by the year 2030 (Bebbington and Unerman 2018; 
Echendu 2020) to which Nigeria is a signatory. While signifcant efforts are being 
made at various levels in Nigeria to meet the specifc targets of these goals, the men￾ace of food remains a major clog in the wheel of this drive. The concept of food is 
understood differently by various professionals and groups. There is however a con￾sensus of opinions that food generally refers to a temporal condition of partial or total 
inundation of normally dry areas as a result of the overfow of inland or tidal waters or 
from unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff (Patel et al. 2017; Seenu et al. 2020; 
Coalson et al. 2021; Alfa et al. 2022). With more than 70% of the earth’s surface cov￾ered with water, food is arguably one of the most widespread natural disasters glob￾ally which has caused the greatest damage to human life and social developments 
amounting to about 31% of global economic losses (Nwafor 2006; Ajin et al. 2013; 
Adebayo and Oruony 2013; Obeta 2014, Komolafe et al. 2015; Alfa et al. 2022). The 
World Health Organization recently reported that between 80 and 90% of all docu￾mented disasters from natural hazards during the past 10 years have resulted from 
foods, droughts, tropical cyclones, heat waves and severe storms. On a global scale, 
foods have affected more than two billion people between 1998 and 2017 (WHO 
2022; Muthusamy et al. 2021). Flood disaster is therefore one of the foremost clogs in 
the wheel of attaining the goal of sustainable cities and communities especially in 
Nigeria which has a very long history of food events.
The menace of fooding directly or indirectly impacts on the attainment of a 
number of the SDGs. On a specifc note, food disaster impacts directly on the 
attainment of SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and 
wellbeing), SDG 4 (Quality education), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 
8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communi￾ties), SDG 14 (Life under water) and SDG 15 (Life on the land) (Echendu 2020). 
This implies that food disaster alone has direct impact on about 53% of the 17 
SDGs thus making it a global emergency that requires urgent attention especially in 
developing economies like Nigeria.
Flood occurrence with varying severities has become an annual event in many 
parts of Nigeria. The events of 2012 and 2022, however, are adjudged as the most 
severe in the last 50 years history of the nation. While that of 2012 affected about 35 
out of the 37 states (including the Federal Capital Territory), resulted in serious 
damages both to lives and properties with Kogi, Plateau, Taraba, Benue, Edo, 
Kwara, Delta and Bayelsa as the most affected, affected a population of 7,705,378 
persons, 3870 communities and resulted in the death of 363 persons, that of 2022 
was even more catastrophic (UNOCHA 2012, 2022). These buttress the fact that the 
consequences of foods are far-reaching, ranging from water- and vector-borne dis￾eases, injuries, chemical hazards, mental health effects associated with emergency 
situations, damaged basic infrastructure and death in some extreme cases (Coalson 
et al. 2021).
M. I. Alfa et al.373
Nearly all urban cities in Nigeria have experienced a share of the menace of 
food. While the low-lying coastal cities understandably experience coastal foods, 
other inland rivers have also been responsible for foods of varying magnitude in 
some cities considered to be uplands. Kano is one such city that has experienced a 
combined menace of food and erosion that has devastated some parts of the com￾mercial city in Northern Nigeria. The challenge of both river and fash foods in the 
city has been exacerbated by the rapid urbanization in the commercial nerve centre, 
most of which are not planned. Coupled with the varying precipitations occasioned 
by the changing climate, the occurrence of fash foods, river foods and some rapid 
onset foods have become common places. The severity of this has also been greatly 
infuenced by the rapid urbanization which has signifcantly increased the amount 
of runoff. Similarly, the rapid expansion of the city of Kano has necessitated the 
development of a number of roads with asphalt overlays some of which do not have 
adequate drains to contain the amount of runoff generated from the respective sub￾catchments, largely because of inappropriate hydrological studies. In most cases 
however, the food structures such as drains, culverts are often lined with concrete 
materials. While these have greatly helped in conveying the food water to some safe 
destinations downstream, they have greatly reduced infltration of water to recharge 
the groundwater and have also led to more fooding situations for downstream com￾munities. Another consequence of this is the reduction of the rate of groundwater 
recharge. It therefore calls for exploration of naturally lined channels that can be 
adequately designed to transport the food water while allowing for a level of infl￾tration that will reduce the volume of fow reaching downstream while increasing 
the rate of groundwater recharge.
21.1.1 Types of Floods
Floods are broadly classifed based on several characteristics such as the location 
and duration/speed of occurrence. Based on the location of occurrence, food is 
classifed into:
(a) Coastal food: This type of food occurs in low-lying coastal areas such as, but 
not restricted to deltas and estuaries when the land is inundated by brackish or 
saline water. The food occurs when the river water spills over the embankment 
along the coastal reaches. The increase in the high tide levels in the sea above 
the normal level by storm surge conditions can greatly intensify this fooding 
situation. Arnoux et al. (2021) studied this type of food at the French Basque 
coast with a focus on defning the return periods of its extreme events.
(b) River or fuvial food: This type of food occurs mostly on foodplains of rivers 
as a result of fow exceeding the discharge-carrying capacity of the stream chan￾nels thereby over-spilling the banks. Most river foods result directly or 
indirectly from climatological factors such as heavy and/or prolonged rainfall 
as well as terrain characteristics (Muthusamy et al. 2021).
21 Exploration of Nature-based Solutions for Management of Perennial Urban Flood…374
(c) Groundwater food: Mancini et al. (2020) defned groundwater food as the out￾fow of groundwater at the ground surface at locations away from defned 
perennial river channels or the rising of groundwater into man-made ground, 
under conditions where the ‘normal’ ranges of groundwater level and ground￾water fow are exceeded.
(d) Pluvial food: This is a type of food that arises from high-intensity extreme 
rainfall and is typifed by overland fow and ponding before the runoff reaches 
a watercourse or drainage system (Singh et al. 2023).
Similarly, foods are classifed based on duration and speed of occurrence as:
(a) Flash Floods: Flash foods usually occur within a short time and show high peak 
runoff usually after a heavy rainfall, tropical storm, failure of dams or levees, 
amongst others (Archer and Fowler 2021; Kaiser et  al. 2020). This usually 
results in the greatest damages to urban society. Most pluvial foods occur as 
fash foods especially in unplanned urban areas. In addition, dam failures could 
also lead to fash foods with fatal consequences.
(b) Slow-Onset Floods: Slow-onset foods usually last for a relatively longer period 
than fash foods. It could last for weeks or even months. The damage caused by 
this kind of food is gradual but with great magnitude. It could lead to loss of 
stock, damage to agricultural products, roads and railway lines.
(c) Rapid-Onset Floods: Rapid-onset foods last for a relatively shorter period than 
slow-onset foods but usually longer period than fash foods. They could last 
for 1 or 2 days only. Although this kind of food lasts for a shorter period, it can 
cause more damages and pose a greater risk to life and property as people usu￾ally have less time to take preventative action during rapid-onset foods.
21.1.2 Causes of Floods
While the causes of foods tend to vary from one place to another depending on the 
available protection and management processes, they can generally be classifed 
into meteorological, geomorphological and land use/urbanization causes (Merz 
et al. 2021). Urbanization and/or the concentration of settlements have continued to 
increase the food damage potentials, as human settlements continue to encroach on 
food-prone areas. In some places, over-reliance on available safety provided by 
existing food control infrastructure, such as dikes, levies and reservoirs, can also 
result in food disaster more severe than the natural ones. For instance, dykes can 
collapse and cause immense destruction when food is on a large scale although it 
was a food-protective structure on a small scale. Losses in this case could and usu￾ally exceed those in natural ones. Furthermore, human actions can also cause foods. 
The insatiable affnity for more fertile lands has usually led to the encroachment on 
M. I. Alfa et al.375
foodplains. Increase in the percentage of imperviousness, deforestation and chan￾nel interference can also cause foods (Swain et al. 2020).
21.1.3 Structural Versus Non-structural Flood 
Management Methods
Broadly speaking, food control measures are classifed into structural and non￾structural measures (UNDRR n.d.; Kundzewicz et al. 2019). The structural mea￾sures refer to physical construction carried out to either reduce or avoid possible 
impacts of food hazards. They are also constructed to increase resilience of people 
and systems to the impacts of food hazards as such, reduce their vulnerability. Non￾structural measures on the other hand refer to such measures that do not involve 
physical construction but rather utilize information, knowledge, practice and/or 
agreement to reduce food disaster risks and impacts. One such non-structural mea￾sure is foodplain mapping. Effective food management, therefore, requires a com￾bination of both structural and non-structural measures.
One such structural measure for addressing fooding and gully problems caused 
by a perennial urban stream is channelization which can either lined by natural 
materials or impervious materials. While concrete-lined channels are desirable for a 
number of advantages, such as ease of construction and the smaller land footprint 
amongst others, the increasing impact of climate change and the comparatively high 
cost of construction makes it necessary to explore other natural systems for channel 
lining that will be more climate-friendly especially for adequate recharge of ground￾water. This is particularly important for a city like Kano that relies greatly on 
groundwater for a lot of domestic water needs.
This study focuses on a comprehensive modelling of food occurrence within the 
Bulbula area of the urban city, and design simulation of the food structures with 
different lining materials so as to establish their effciency.
21.2 Materials and Methods
21.2.1 The Study Area
The study was carried out in the Bulbula area of Kano City. The section of the river 
included in the study starts from a bridge at Latitude 12.033°N and Longitude 
8.562°E with an outfall at Latitude 12.053°N and Longitude 8.551°E spanning over 
a total length of about 3.4 km (Fig. 21.1). The river lies just at the boundary between 
Nassarawa and Ungogo Local Government Areas (LGAs).

21.2.2 Data Collection
Daily rainfall data for the meteorological station at the Aminu Kano International 
Airport, Kano was obtained from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet). 
The daily rainfall amount covering the period of 1985–2020 was used for the gen￾eration of Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) Curve for the project site as well to 
estimate a correction factor to cater for climate change. The descriptive characteris￾tics of the meteorological data collected are presented in Table 21.1.
Elevation data for the gully sites was obtained using differential GPS survey 
equipment. Spot heights were processed in Autodesk Civil 3D and made available for 
design. The survey captured all structures within the established right-of-way corri￾dor on the right and left banks of the gully, and extended to outfalls of rivers/streams.
Furthermore, remotely sensed satellite datasets such as the Shuttle Radar 
Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model and global land cover data 
were obtained from the earth explorer portal of the United States Geological 
Services and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) global 
land use/land cover map respectively. Satellite imageries obtained through Google 
M. I. Alfa et al.377
earth pro were also used in the analysis. The soil map of the project area was 
extracted from the digital soil map of the world available on the Food and Agricultural 
Organization (FAO)’s website while the detailed characteristics were extracted from 
the Harmonized World Soil Database viewer developed by the FAO and its develop￾ment partners. All the datasets obtained were projected to the Universal Transverse 
Mercator Zone 32 with WGS 1984 datum.
21.2.3 Delineation of Watersheds
The delineation of the respective sub-catchments of the gully segments was carried 
out using the ArcHydro and HEC-GeoHMS tools in ArcGIS 10.7 using the verti￾cally corrected SRTM Digital Elevation data and the drainage network of the project 
area. The source and the method of correction have been described previously (Alfa 
et al. 2019). The Terrain Pre-processing was carried out using Arc Hydro tools while 
the catchment delineation and extraction of catchment and stream characteristics 
were carried out using the HEC-GeoHMS extension tools both in ArcGIS 10.7.
21.2.4 Estimation of Design Flood
The rational equation method of estimating peak runoff rates described previously 
by Chin (2019) was adopted in this study. The peak runoff rate, Q is related to the 
rainfall intensity, I by Eq. (21.1).
Q C = 0 278 IA ( ) 3 . / m s
(21.1)
where C is the composite runoff coeffcient of the catchment, I is the rainfall inten￾sity expressed in millimetres per hour for a certain time of concentration and A is the 
catchment area in square kilometres.
21.2.4.1 Estimation of Rainfall Intensity
The estimation of rainfall intensity for the project area was done following the 
method developed by Oyebande (1982). He developed an expression for estimating 
the rainfall intensity for various storm durations as expressed by Eq. (21.2).

The values of 1/α and β for various storm durations corresponding to rainfall 
zone VIII where the study area is located (Kano) are presented in Table 21.2. The 
rainfall intensity model was calibrated using the 36-year annual rainfall mean of the 
study area. A calibration factor of 1.5 estimated was used to adjust the scale and 
location factors.
The rainfall intensities of the various sub-catchments were estimated based on 
the corresponding time of concentration. The time of concentration is the time 
required for water to travel from the hydraulically most remote point of the basin to 
the point of interest. Kirpich/Ramser’s formula expressed by Eq. (21.3) was used to 
estimate the time of concentration in minutes (Sugumaran and Kannan 2019).

to estimate the composite runoff coeffcient based on the slope and fnally based on 
the soil texture class.

21.2.5 Hydraulic Design of Nature-based Channel
Hydraulic design criteria are based on the best hydraulic section to reduce excessive 
scouring, as well as deposition. The fow should be uniform and subcritical. The 
design followed the procedures of Mays (2001).
21.2.5.1 Design of Main Channel Size
The required fow for channel calculation is obtained using the Rational (Lloyd￾Davies) or the SCS-CN formula. The following hydraulic equations are used for 
channel calculation

(21.5)
Using continuity Eq. (21.6) and knowing the permissible velocity, it is possible to 
size the channel. The Manning’s n has the value of 0.035 for natural channels and 
0.014 for concrete channels (Arcement and Schneider 1989).
Q V= A ( ) m s 3 /
(21.6)
Equations (21.5) and (21.6) were solved to estimate the channel sections for both 
natural lining and concrete lining.
21.2.5.2 Design of Transitional Channel Sections
Transitional channel section occurs at points of change in slope, width or from 
one shape of the channel to the other. An example is the keying of channels to a 
culvert or bridge. Substantial energy loss can be achieved by the provision of this 
structure.
Angle of transition (α) is given by Eq. (21.7), while Eqs. (21.8) and (21.9) are 
used to classify the fow:
tan / α = 1 3Fr (21.7)

α = Angle difference between the two joining structures
F = Froude number used to classify fow type as subcritical, critical or supercritical
D = Hydraulic mean depth
A = Channel area
T = Top width of channel
21.2.5.3 Freeboard
The freeboard refers to the vertical distance between either the top of the chan￾nel or the top of the channel lining and the water surface (design fow at normal 
depth). The freeboard which is usually provided to account for uncertainty in 
design, construction, and operation of the channel was estimated using the 
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation equation as in (Chow 1959; Wurbs and James 2002) 
and given by Eq. (21.10):
F ky b = 0 5. m 5 ( ) (21.10)
where
Fb = Freeboard (m)
y = Flow depth (m)
k = Coeffcient varying from 1.5 for a fow capacity of about 0.57 m3
/s, to 2.5 for a 
fow capacity exceeding 85 m3

21.2.5.4 Permissible Velocity
The minimum permissible velocity is the lowest velocity that will prevent sedimen￾tation and vegetative growth (crude estimates: 0.6–0.9 m/s for sedimentation and 
0.75 m/s for vegetation). Table 21.3 presents the mean permissible velocities against 
erosion.
21.2.5.5 Comparative Analysis
A comparison of the various design options was carried out based on the ease of 
construction and maintenance, environmental sustainability, structural safety and 
cost-effectiveness. The relative performance indices were developed by scoring 
both options on a scale of 1 and 2 with 1 being the least score. This was applicable 
for all criteria except the cost comparison where the actual cost ratio was used. 
The total score was then normalized to obtain the relative performance indices for 
both options.

21.2.5.6 Hydraulic Modelling
One-dimensional hydraulic modelling of the designed channels was carried out 
using the HEC RAS model following methods that have been described previously 
(Brunner 1995; Pathan and Agnihotri 2021).
21.3 Results
21.3.1 Rainfall Characteristics of the Study Area
The long-term (36 years) average monthly rainfall of Kano is presented in Fig. 21.2
while the total annual rainfall trend and the fuctuations from the 36 years average 
are respectively presented in Figs. 21.3 and 21.4.
Rainfall in Kano is concentrated between April and October with the highest 
rainfall in September. The total annual rainfall of Kano (1985–2020) presented in 
Fig.  21.3 showed that the 36  years highest annual rainfall of 2535.50  mm was 
recorded in 1985 while the least annual rainfall of 762.20 mm was recorded in 2019. 
In fact, the rainfall recorded for the last 4 years (2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020) were 
all less than 1000 mm which indicates a decline in the annual rainfall of the region. 
This is also buttressed by the declining trend as shown in Fig. 21.3.
Similarly, the fuctuations of annual rainfall from the 36-year mean annual rain￾fall of Kano presented in Fig. 21.4 reveals that maximum fuctuation of 929.1 mm 
was recorded in 1985 while the minimum fuctuation of 1.9 mm was recorded in

1989. A positive fuctuation was recorded for 19 years which implies that the annual 
rainfall for those years was above the 36 years average of 1606.4 mm while the 
remaining 17 years had negative fuctuation implying that their annual rainfall was 
less than the 36 years average value. While the fuctuation was highest in 1985, 
there was a fairly low and stable fuctuation until a sudden surge between 2017 and 
2020 where the annual rainfall dropped signifcantly.
21.3.2 Bulbula Catchment Characteristics and Peak 
Runoff Rates
The delineated sub-catchments of the Bulbula Gully project are shown in Fig. 21.5. 
The characteristics of the respective sub-catchments as well as the design food 
estimates are presented in Table 21.4.
21.3.3 Channel and Culvert Characteristics
The designed dimensions of the channel are presented in Table 21.5. Trapezoidal 
channel type was adopted and designed for both the concrete-lined and natural 
channels.
21.3.4 Comparison of Nature-based Channel Lining 
and Concrete Lining
The hydraulic parameters of the channel designs are presented in Table 21.6 while 
the preliminary costs are presented in Table 21.7. Similarly, a relative performance 
index for both options is presented in Table 21.8.
21.4 Discussion
The results of this study demonstrated that both concrete lined channels and the 
natural unlined ones can be effective means of controlling food and gully problems. 
While the lined channel may be desirable due to the relative ease of construction 
and maintenance, the nature-based channels are more environmentally and econom￾ically sustainable. This agrees with the previous fndings of Chapman et al. (2002) 
that natural channels produce the most biologically healthy communities. This 
assertion was also buttressed by Kouwen (1992) in a study to investigate the modern 
approach to the design of grassed channels.

21.5 Conclusions
The design of a nature-based solution to perennial food and erosion problem in a 
Nigeria commercial city was carried out in this study. The study involved estimation 
of the peak runoff rates which followed the rational equation method, as well as the 
appropriate sizing of the main channels as well as the transition channels for the 
various segments. The hydraulic modelling for verifcation of the channel sizing 
was carried out using the HEC-RAS model. Both the concrete-lined trapezoidal 
channel and the natural trapezoidal channel were considered and compared using 
the model. While both designs were suitable for the purpose of food and erosion 
control, the relative performance indices showed that the natural channel is a pre￾ferred option with a score of 1 against the 0.7 scored by the concrete-lined channel. 
The study therefore concludes that nature-based lined channels should be explored 
in urban drainage designs where the required space is available.

Abstract This contribution explains and summarizes the latest ndings on the pos￾itive and negative effects of greenery at the street level. The LES-based PALM mod￾eling system was used for simulations on a previously validated domain. Dense 
planting of trees can improve thermal comfort by decreasing thermal comfort indi￾ces up to 15  °C, surface temperature reduction can even reach several tens of 
degrees. Air temperature drop is an order of magnitude lower, specically around 
1 °C. Their effect is mostly local, effects in their surroundings were found only in 
case of air temperature. Dense tree planting close to heavy trafc roads could 
increase the relative daily-averaged concentration of PM2.5 by more than 30%. The 
method of planting plays an important role; one row of trees in the middle of the 
street (+7.5%) has a different effect than two rows on their sides (+18.6%). The 
hourly averaged maximum concentrations, typically in times of morning and after￾noon peak, can increase from 50% to 300%. The increase is dependent on the inten￾sity of trafc or other local emission sources in the planned planting sites, as well as 
on the quantity, location, and characteristics of the planted greenery.

22.1 Introduction
Human activity in the settlement areas largely affects the surrounding climatic con￾ditions. Modern science refers to that using the terms “the climate of cities” or 
“urban climates”. Probably the best-known and most thoroughly studied manifesta￾tion of the city’s climate is the so-called urban heat island (UHI). The UHI is defned 
as an area of higher air temperature in the canopy layer and atmospheric boundary 
layer above the city or industrial agglomeration compared to the rural surrounding 
(Oke et al. 2017). At the same time as a result of climate change, the urban popula￾tion face increasing risks related to the growing number of warm and hot days, as 
well as the increasing probability of occurrence of heat waves (Gasparrini et al. 
2017; Vicedo-Cabrera et al. 2021; IPCC 2022). Additionally, due to rapid urban 
development cities are signifcantly expanding into the surrounding, mostly rural, 
landscape (Ouředníček et al. 2013). These land cover changes, together with a high 
ratio of the urban population, contribute to an increase in the vulnerability of the 
population. Such adverse factors increase the importance of ameliorating (bio)cli￾matic conditions of/in cities.
To increase the applicability of urban climate research to the practice, recent 
discourse gets beyond UHI and works with more comprehensive concepts of ther￾mal exposure and thermal comfort in urban areas (Lehnert et al. 2021a). Thermal 
exposure takes into account not only air temperature (like UHI) but also other envi￾ronmental factors of human energy balance – solar radiation, air humidity, and wind 
velocity. Thermal comfort apart from that includes physiological and psychological 
factors.
To express thermal exposure or thermal comfort, the biometeorological indices 
are employed to indicate the degree of heat stress on a person in the urban environ￾ment. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) represents one of the most 
widely used indices worldwide (Fiala et  al. 2012) and the only one that has an 
“open” (i.e., clearly described) formula. Another widely used index is physiologi￾cally equivalent temperature (PET) (e.g., Potchter et al. 2018). PET formulas were 
published in VDI Norm 3787, Blatt 2, but they were not freely available and well￾explained. First complete description of the PET model with correction of mistakes 
and typos in the original code was published by Walther and Goestchel (2018).
Another well-known manifestation of the urban climate is the deteriorated air 
quality, typically associated with intensive car traffc or industry. Especially during 
the winter time, smog situations occur frequently and various measures are being 
considered to reduce the concentration of air pollutants; from limits on heating with 
coal or wood to transportation limits, e.g., closure of certain zones for individual 
transport or restrictions based on even or odd license plate numbers (MHMP Smog 
situations 2022). In planning the measures, the source of the air pollution needs to 
J. Geletič et al.393
be taken into account. The sources can be roughly split into (1) local emissions (e.g., 
pollution from local traffc), (2) long-distance transmission (pollution from power 
plants, industry, mines, etc.), (3) substances created by reactions in the atmosphere 
(e.g., tropospheric ozone, secondary organic aerosols). The local emissions are pri￾marily suitable for mitigation with micro-scale measures supported by local munici￾palities (Sofa et al. 2020). Summer episodes of high concentrations of ground-level 
ozone, which in addition often coincide with heat-wave episodes, are similarly seri￾ous but the ability to infuence them by local measures is lower (e.g., Fischer et al. 
2004; Stathopoulou et al. 2008; Coates et al. 2016).
Both problems mentioned above, excessive heat and deteriorated air quality, are 
characterized by their high spatio-temporal variability. This is, in addition to the 
infuence of the terrain, mesoclimate and macroclimate, mainly due to the specifc 
radiation and thermal properties of surfaces and urban vegetation (Geletič et  al. 
2021). The radiation and thermal properties of surfaces affect not only the 
temperature-related conditions of the city, but also the wind velocity in the streets 
(Resler et al. 2017, 2021). At the same time, there is a very strong microscale effect 
of small anthropogenic surfaces in the streets or on the building walls, with dimen￾sions typically in units or tens of meters. All energy processes also have an effect on 
the spread of air pollution in the street canyon.
To obtain relevant and comprehensive information in a complex urban environ￾ment, it is essential to model all processes related to the urban microclimate on a 
fne-enough scale, in terms of spatial resolution ideally in units of meters. For 
detailed street-level simulations, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are 
currently used. They are further divided into the two most frequently used methods 
according to the principle used for a turbulent fow calculation: (1) Reynolds 
Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS); (2) Large-Eddy Simulation (LES). Another 
method, Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), is not widely used for modeling of the 
atmospheric boundary layer. The RANS-based types of models include, e.g., 
MUKLIMO_3, ENVI-met, or SOLENE-microclimat, while LES-based models 
include PALM or uDALES (Geletič et al. 2021). There are important differences 
between RANS and LES; the RANS-based models use a statistical approach and 
simulate only the mean values of the quantities, with the turbulence being com￾pletely parameterized. This approach proposed by Reynolds exploits the similarities 
of turbulent and chaotic molecular momentum transfer. The problem is that this 
approach is imprecise and the results are strongly dependent on the accuracy of the 
turbulent fow parameterization. LES-based models are based on the method of 
scale-separation of the turbulent eddies. Compared with the RANS approach, turbu￾lent eddies are modeled directly, but only if they are large enough. Below a certain 
size limit (corresponding to the resolution of the model), eddies are removed using 
turbulent feld fltering and their infuence is modeled by so-called sub-grid models. 
The differences between RANS and LES principles have two most signifcant 
implications: (1) RANS models have a very limited ability to simulate the details of 
turbulence in urban spaces and (2) due to the averaging of RANS are not usable for 
detailed and comprehensive simulations. Other important differences between 
RANS and LES principles are described in Salim et al. (2011) and Tominaga and 
22 Complex Micro-meteorological Effects of Urban Greenery in an Urban Canyon…394
Stathopoulos (2011). On the other hand, LES models require a fne-scale grid and a 
relatively short simulation time step, which increases their computational costs. 
Simulations usually run on supercomputers or large clusters, capable of processing 
such large-scale tasks. For the purpose of this study, the LES-based model PALM 
was used; more detailed model description could be found in Maronga et al. (2020) 
or in Resler et al. (2021).
Apart from the wind velocity, the microscale model must accurately simulate all 
the energy processes in the urban canopy layer. These include, for example, the 
interaction of shortwave and longwave radiation with street surfaces, houses, and 
trees, the accumulation and releasing of heat by building walls and other materials, 
and the energy balance of buildings (Krč et al. 2021). The importance of the imple￾mentation of energy processes in the urban environment is analyzed in detail by 
Salim et al. (2022). Currently, PALM is probably the most comprehensive urban 
microclimate model (Geletič et al. 2021) and it became the frst LES-based model 
with the ability to capture all the most important energetic processes in the urban 
environment in detail (Maronga et al. 2020).
The important part of modeling is verifcation and validation of the model results; 
it is necessary to compare the simulation results with the measurements. Standard 
meteorological measurements typically do not have suffcient spatiotemporal reso￾lution for a fne-scale model validation; moreover, measuring locations are often 
located outside urban areas. Special measurement campaigns or local measuring 
networks are organized for specifc models; they are designed uniquely for valida￾tion purposes or for analysis of specifc urban microclimate. Validation campaign of 
the model we used was held in the summer and autumn of 2018 in Prague-Dejvice 
(Resler et al. 2021). It focused mainly on meteorological variables, transport-related 
air pollution, and horizontal and vertical surface temperature. Currently, another 
campaign is in progress, focusing on wind velocity and air pollution concentration 
in different levels of urban canyon. It is important to note that without proper valida￾tion, model results can be irrelevant or downright misleading. If the simulation 
results are validated and the model is calibrated, it is easy to use the data as input for 
the scenarios; for example, to simulate different variants of planting new trees, 
changing types or properties of surfaces, etc.
In its essence, it is an extremely complex system of connections and interactions 
that must be solved using complex numerical models. The complexity of the inter￾actions at the street scale can be illustrated by one of the most popular measures to 
mitigate the negative effects of climate change, which is represented by the so￾called urban greenery: especially the planting of high-grown greenery (e.g., Gago 
et al. 2013; Křištofová et al. 2022). General interactions were described in Geletič
et al. (2022), but further analysis of dynamic variables is missing; wind velocity and 
its effect on PM2.5. Salim et al. (2011) proved that LES signifcantly improved the 
fow prediction and thus pollutant concentration producing better and more consis￾tent solutions. They also provide time-evolution and statistical distribution of fow 
properties. In other words, LES computations can provide important information on 
instantaneous fuctuations and, thus, would be more suitable than RANS when 
detailed analyses are required. Despite that, a more sophisticated description of the 
J. Geletič et al.395
effects of tree properties, like leaf area density, branch density, crown shape, etc., on 
vertical profles in street canyons is still missing (Watanabe 2004).
Therefore, the particular research questions of this contribution are: (i) explain 
and summarize the basic principles and differences between the microscale models; 
(ii) to describe direct and indirect links between commonly used variables (air tem￾perature, surface temperature, UTCI, PET, wind velocity, and PM2.5), and (iii) to 
interpret the latest knowledge about the positive and negative effects of greenery in 
street space using the example of several scenarios in Prague-Dejvice.
22.2 Materials and Methods
22.2.1 PALM Model Setup
The PALM model was confgured in two nested domains. The parent domain 
extends horizontally by 4000 m × 4000 m in the x and y directions, respectively, 
with a regular grid size of 10 m. The model height was approx. 3000 m with 10 m 
resolution in the lowest levels and vertical stretching up to 20  m starting from 
250 m. The nested child domain, which was used for our analysis, has a horizontal 
extent of 1440 × 1440 m, height of 250 m, and resolution of 2 m in all dimensions. 
The surface energy balance for the individual surfaces (vegetation, pavement, build￾ings, and water) was calculated by the LSM (land surface module) and BSM (build￾ing surface module) components; for more details see Resler et al. (2017), Maronga 
et al. (2020), Gehrke et al. (2021), and Krč et al. (2021). The impact of the resolved 
trees and shrubs on the dynamics and energy processes was modeled by the plant 
canopy model (PCM). A complete description of the model setup and used modules 
is in Geletič et al. (2022).
To correctly solve the energy balance equations in the PALM modeling system 
using BSM and LSM, numerous material input parameters are required. Detailed 
parameters are needed for proper description of surface interactions, e.g., albedo, 
emissivity, thermal conductivity, roughness length, and characteristics of the skin 
layer and volume layers in terms of thermal capacity and volumetric thermal con￾ductivity. A similar level of detail for input data, i.e., albedo and emissivity of sur￾faces is required by RTM (radiative transfer module), which calculates all radiative 
and heat exchanges. Simulations were run at high spatial resolution (2  m) for a 
heterogeneous domain with a mixture of different types of ground surfaces, walls, 
and roof materials. For the present study, a detailed GIS database, previously intro￾duced by Geletič et al. (2021) and Resler et al. (2021), was used.
A typical summer period with clear-sky conditions was simulated for the stron￾gest heat-wave episode in Prague in 2019, which occurred between July 23 and 26. 
The frst simulated day (July 24) was considered to be model spin-up, and the fol￾lowing day (25 July) was used for assessing simulation outputs. Typical summer 
heat-wave conditions occur during the day chosen for the analysis. This episode was 
selected as a day with maximum potential of urban greenery effects.

22.2.2 Urban Greening Scenarios
The effects of trees were analyzed based on three scenarios that were considered 
after discussions with the Municipality of the Capital City of Prague and the Prague 
Institute of Planning and Development (IPR Prague). The frst two scenarios repre￾sent the proposed tree-planting plan for the City in the time period 2020–2030. A 
third scenario is based on a broader ongoing study that investigates the implementa￾tion of green walls and green roofs in the densely built-up parts of Dejvice (Prague, 
Czech Republic) (Geletič et al. 2022). Figure 22.1a shows the domain with 540 
trees added to streets on the east side of the domain. All trees were identical: 
Platanus acerifolia (broad-leaved) or Picea abies (coniferous), 12 m height (trunk 
is 4 m high and 50 cm wide, crown is 10 m wide) with a circular or triangular shape 
Fig. 22.1 Average wind speed change at 10 m due to the planting of broad-leaved trees (existing 
trees are gray points, newly planted are green) in Prague-Dejvice between 09–10 h (a) and 21–22 h 
(b) UTC, including the effect on average hourly relative concentrations PM2.5 (c, d). The results 
refer to July 25, the hottest day of 2019
J. Geletič et al.397
and a leaf area density (LAD) of 1.6 or 2.8 at the crown border respectively. LAD 
decreases exponentially toward the center of the crown according to the potential 
irradiation of the leaves in the crown (Geletič et al. 2022).
22.3 Results
The basic functions of trees in urban environments are shading and evapotranspira￾tion. These processes lead to changes in the energy balance of horizontal and verti￾cal surfaces which infuence the most energy-related variables, e.g., surface 
temperature, mean radiant temperature, or air temperature. Moreover, the trees con￾tribute to changes in the wind velocity, mainly decreasing wind speed and upward 
turbulent fow above overheated surfaces. The advantage of the LES-based model is 
the possibility of relevant evaluation of the effect on airfow, which represents one 
of the most signifcant factors for the spread of air pollution in the street canyon 
(besides the air pollution sources). In the frst part, the consequences of changes in 
the energy balance and their effect on the fow, which are not generally known, will 
be described. The effect of trees on energy-related variables will be described in the 
second part. All results will be evaluated at the pedestrian level.
22.3.1 Urban Greenery and Air Quality
In the parts of the street canyon where there are buildings on both sides, vortices 
similar to convective cells known as cross-canyon or helical vortices usually form. 
In summer, the surface of the street and the walls overheat on the south-facing walls 
(sunlit walls), along which the warm air begins to rise. Conversely, on the shaded 
side of the street, a downward movement of air often occurs and this forms a vortex 
in the street. Alternatively, wind blowing above the level of the roofs can also form 
a vortex in the street canyon, and these two phenomena can “compete” with each 
other, or, on the contrary, reinforce each other. The resulting eddies are often signif￾cantly infuenced by trees or facade objects, so the result may contain more than just 
one eddy (multiple-stacked vortices). Cells in multiple-stacked vortices tend to 
recirculate polluted air internally rather than mix it with the cleaner air in higher 
levels or above roofs, therefore pollution removal is poor in these conditions. 
Vortices created in this way play a key role in the transport of nitrogen oxides (NO, 
NO2), dust particles (PM2.5 and PM10), and other pollutants emitted, e.g., by car 
transport.
If the vortex in the urban canyon works “correctly”, it helps to improve air qual￾ity; because it transports pollutants out of the street canyon over the roofs of houses. 
Trees capture part of the pollution on their leaves but they also slow down the air 
fow with their crowns. By this, they contribute to the accumulation of traffc emis￾sions in the street canyon due to fow blocking effect. If the trees are close to each 
22 Complex Micro-meteorological Effects of Urban Greenery in an Urban Canyon…398
other, their crowns form a “green cover”, which leads to a signifcant increase in the 
concentration of pollutants. For example, if the mentioned Evropska street were to 
be densely planted by trees, the relative daily-averaged concentration of PM2.5
would increase by more than 30% (+32.2%). At the same time, the method of plant￾ing would play an important role; one row of trees in the middle of the street (+7.5%) 
has a different effect than two rows on their sides (+18.6%). The same effect is vis￾ible in densely built-up areas around Vítězné náměstí, where the infuence of trees 
may not be obvious at frst glance (Fig. 22.1a, b). It is necessary to take into account 
that the effect changes in time and space – it will be worse in times of intense traffc 
(morning and afternoon peak; see Fig. 22.1c, d) or in the short period after sunset.
The characteristics of the trees play an important role: the height and width of the 
tree, the crown shape, or the leaf area density. For example, the relative daily￾averaged increase of PM2.5 concentration is only +2.1% (broad-leaved) or +1.8% 
(coniferous). But these averages were calculated for the entire domain area, not only 
for planted areas. If we consider only the locations where trees were planted, the 
daily-averaged increase is more than +13.5%. The effect of newly planted trees is 
visible even at greater distances from their trunk (the increase inside the area with a 
radius of 10 m is +15.8%). But this represents still the daily-average; considering 
the interval of hourly-averaged maximum, the relative increment of the values in the 
planting sites is 56.9–372.6% for broad-leaved and 55.3–290.6% for coniferous 
trees. The hourly averaged maximum concentrations can be from 50% to 300% 
higher than before. It suggests that when analyzing the impact of planting vegeta￾tion, it is necessary to consider the wider surroundings of the planting. However, the 
area should not be too large, otherwise the results may be distorted by inappropriate 
interpretation.
22.3.2 Effects of Trees on Energy Exchange
The trees shade the surface of the street with their crowns and decrease the surface 
temperature. The daily-averaged drop in surface temperature directly under the 
crowns is 17.2 °C for broad-leaved and 17.4 °C for coniferous trees (note: values for 
coniferous trees will be in brackets onwards). The maximum surface temperature 
differences are typically around midday and can reach up to 33.1 (32.2)°C. However, 
the infuence of the tree’s crown is – thanks to the shadow – limited purely to its 
closest surroundings; the average daily decrease in surface temperature within a 
radius of 10 m from the tree trunk is only 3.6 (3.1)°C. The average reduction in 
surface temperature for the entire domain area is practically the same for both types 
of trees, 0.2 °C (Fig. 22.2a).
Vegetation can further lower the air temperature through evapotranspiration in 
appropriate conditions. Planting trees could actually reduce the air temperature 
under the trees by more than 5 °C in some places. However, such a change is, like 
the maximum in the case of surface temperature, extremely rare. An ideal combina￾tion of the effects of several factors must be met, such as the colors of the walls and 
J. Geletič et al.399
surfaces, refections from the windows, the shadow of the crown, etc. The drop in 
air temperature is usually moderate; in this study, the daily-averaged air temperature 
reduction directly under the trees reaches 1.1 (0.9)°C, in the 10 m radius by 0.8 
(0.7)°C and by 0.2 (0.1)°C within the entire domain. The mean daily decrease in air 
temperature is shown in Fig. 22.2b. Despite the potential infuence of trees on reduc￾ing the air temperature in the entire domain is very small, it is still distinguishable.
The air temperature and the mean radiant temperature represents one of the input 
variables for biometeorological indices; the most used are UTCI and PET. Similar 
to the surface temperature, the amount of radiation received by a person walking 
along the street plays a signifcant role for the UTCI and PET values. Tree planting 
can reduce the UTCI directly under the tree by up to 15.1 °C (the maximum is the 
same), the daily average reduction is 2.8 °C for both tree types. For the surroundings

biometeorological indices UTCI (c) and PET (d) for the scenario refecting newly planted broad￾leaf trees; existing trees are gray points, newly planted are green points. The results refer to July 
25, the hottest day of 2019
22 Complex Micro-meteorological Effects of Urban Greenery in an Urban Canyon…400
with a 10 m radius from the tree, the UTCI decreased by 2.2 (1.9)°C and in the 
whole area by 0.4 (0.3)°C (Fig. 22.2c). The PET results show a similar trend as 
UTCI; the maximum decrease reaches 29.3 (29.9)°C, but the daily-averaged 
decrease directly under the trees amounts to 4.6 (4.5)°C. In the 10 m radius of the 
tree, the average daily decrease is 3.5 (2.9)°C, and the averages for the entire domain 
are the same, 0.2 °C (Fig. 22.2d). The reduction of UTCI and PET is tied to the 
given tree and its immediate surroundings; a similar picture can be seen as in case 
of surface temperature.
22.3.3 Green Roofs and Green Walls
Results show only a minor effect of implementing green roofs and green walls on 
surface temperature, air temperature, and UTCI or PET at the pedestrian level. The 
daily-averaged reduction of surface temperature reaches 0.6  °C, air temperature 
about 0.1 °C, and 0.2 °C and 0.1 °C for PET and UTCI respectively. Due to convec￾tion, the reduction of heat generated at the roof level, which is achieved by the green 
roofs, does not directly affect the pedestrian level underneath the roofs and the lim￾ited cooling effect is more spatially uniform.
22.4 Discussion
The presented simulation results would beneft from further contextualization, but 
there is no space for further discussion of the results described before in Belda et al. 
(2021), Resler et al. (2021), or Geletič et al. (2022). Hence, the discussion is primar￾ily focused on practical problems when modeling tools are used. First of all, simula￾tions were completed for the city of Prague, a city with a temperate oceanic climate 
located in the northern temperate zone and it should be emphasized that mitigation 
measures will vary for other climate conditions. Secondly, results obtained here 
show rather higher cooling potential of urban greenery, in part because they are 
simulated for a strong heat wave episode (Geletič et al. 2022). Predicted effects for 
a typical summer day in the Central European region would be likely lower (Lehnert 
et al. 2021b). Finally, at neighborhood scales, the thermal impacts from tree plant￾ing and green walls will be represented mostly as air temperature changes, which is 
the most spatially uniform effect (Geletič et al. 2022). The changes in air tempera￾ture are one of the components of UTCI or PET changes.
In consideration of the complexity and diversity of the urban environment, it is 
impossible to give general instructions in the meaning of when, where, and which 
trees to plant. More precisely, all recommendations will always have only a very 
limited validity. The study suggests that microclimatic models can represent an 
important tool for modern and comprehensive urban planning (e.g., Crank et al. 
2018; Wong et  al. 2021a; Geletič et  al. 2022). Thanks to the possibility of 
J. Geletič et al.401
comprehensive confguration of model parametrization, it is possible to utilize many 
scenarios (e.g., simulation of the tree growth effects, the different parameters of tree 
crowns, tree height, the amount of leaves, soil moisture availability, etc.). At the 
same time, from the very beginning of the consideration of the utilization of 
microscale models, it is necessary to bear in mind whether the model is able to cover 
relevant information and whether it can solve the given problem at all (see the dif￾ferences between the RANS and LES approach in the introduction), especially in 
the analysis of the infuence of trees on the wind velocity and air quality). Our 
results emphasize that in order to improve the reliability and the predictive capabil￾ity of CFD simulations, future studies should collect and employ relevant measure￾ment data to support simulation results (Toparlar et  al. 2017). This requirement 
means additional fnancial funding demands on targeted measurement campaigns. 
Nevertheless, if a given simulation is expected to be used in the real decision￾making processes and urban planning, the minimum requirement from the local 
authority should be at least validation of the model under similar conditions in the 
city where the study is intended. Validation realized in other cities does not neces￾sarily refect the specifcs of the given character of the urban space and local cli￾matic conditions.
Utilization of the modeling tools, which focuses mainly on physical and chemi￾cal processes connected to the functions of trees in the streets of studied cities, 
brings certain limitations. The real effect of the tree has a signifcant impact on its 
immediate surroundings. For example, planting one tree in an alley or a densely 
planted street probably will not cause any signifcant change in the street. Planting 
a tree near tall buildings can have a similarly negligible effect, when the street is 
already mostly shaded from the direct solar radiation by the buildings and the effect 
of the tree is limited only to the time when the sun rays fall on it (e.g., Lee and 
Mayer 2018; Lee et al. 2020; Lachapelle et al. 2023). An example of the attainment 
of maximum effect can be the planting of new trees in open spaces. Naturally, it is 
necessary to consider all other factors that are unique to each location, such as the 
intensity of traffc, the space for the tree to thrive (space for the root system and its 
growth) or the conditions for the optimal performance of functions (especially the 
availability of moisture) (Wong et al. 2021b). Related to air quality, the simulations 
do not consider any chemical reactions or aerosol dynamic processes of air pollut￾ants; only the dispersion of traffc-related PM2.5 is considered.
22.5 Conclusions
A comparative study between baseline simulations and mature tree planting sce￾narios using the LES model PALM describes and discusses the “maximum” real 
impact on pedestrians in the street canyon under current climate conditions during 
a heat wave episode. Dense planting of trees can improve thermal comfort by 
decreasing biometeorological indices up to 15 °C, surface temperature reduction 
can even reach several tens of degrees. Both characteristics are directly affected by 
22 Complex Micro-meteorological Effects of Urban Greenery in an Urban Canyon…402
the amount of incident sunlight, so the most pronounced effect is tied strictly to the 
surroundings of newly planted trees. The effects of planting on air temperature are 
different; its drop is an order of magnitude lower, specifcally around 1 °C. It can be 
defned as a local cooling effect of the trees. However, some smaller reduction of air 
temperature can be found in wider surroundings. In contrast to the positive effect on 
temperatures and thermal comfort, trees can have a negative effect on air pollution; 
in extreme cases, a signifcant increase in the concentration of air pollutants can be 
observed on a local scale. The increase is dependent on the intensity of traffc or 
other local emission sources in the planned planting sites, as well as on the quantity, 
location, and characteristics of the planted greenery and characteristics of the street 
canyon. It is also necessary to keep in mind that the analyzed results are an indica￾tion of the maximum potential effects which will change signifcantly during the 
year. The effect of green roofs and green walls at the pedestrian level is minor or 
negligible on both thermal environment and air quality. These fndings however do 
not undermine the merit of green roofs in reducing heat storage and effuent sensible 
heat fux. Last, but not least, CFD models have a strong potential in testing adapta￾tion and mitigation measures. Detailed input data and complex validation of results 
mean additional costs. But when it is done, it is easy to simulate tens of scenarios 
and use precise results following best practice principles.

Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient 
Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil 
Amendments for Urban and Peri-urban 
Olive Tree Agroforestry Systems 
in Southern Europe
Vesela Tanaskovic Gassner, Dimitris Symeonidis, and Konstantinos Koukaras
Abstract Biomimicking has long been an interest of many scienti	c and engineer￾ing 	elds. When two ecosystems overlap, we have the famous edge effect. In this 
article, we want to explore getting the same abundance of life using a biomimicry 
approach to agroforestry by bringing aquatic life full of nutrients to the soil. These 
nutrients would otherwise harm the marine ecosystem and in this way, as they get 
removed before reaching the sea, they help grow life on land, while preserving 
marine life. Nature-based solutions to water management are usually grouped into 
	ve established categories, adding to this well-established lists could be harvesting 
agricultural nutrient runoff with microalgae, and using them as soil amendment in 
peri-urban and urban settings, especially focusing on olive trees in and around 
Mediterranean and Greek cities. The ancient olive tree is a cornerstone for further 
research, not only because of its general tolerance to drought, very easy manage￾ment, somewhat salt tolerance, but above all its overwhelming presence in the whole 
Mediterranean basin. Here we will try to identify at least three most accessible sites 
for implementing a nutrient runoff harvesting system using algae in Greece. These 
sites will be characterised by infrastructure development, levels of nutrients present 
in the waters, vicinity to an urban area as well as vicinity to a highly cultivated area, 
local willingness to experiment and collaborate in for developing an urban (or peri￾urban) agroforestry system with the traditional olive tree as the central

23.1 Introduction
Biomimicry is a feld of study that looks to nature for inspiration in order to solve 
complex problems and design more sustainable and effcient systems. It involves 
the examination of natural processes and phenomena, such as the structure of a 
meat-eating fower or the behaviour of a bee colony, and applying those concepts to 
human-made systems, designs and technologies. The goal of biomimicry is to cre￾ate solutions that are in harmony with the natural world and which can be sustained 
over the long term.
For over 3.8 billion years, species have been evolving in various ways. Humans 
have been inspired by this evolution. Examples span from ancient Greek mythology 
and the legend of Daedelus and Icarus to the Renaissance period and Leonardo da 
Vinci’s fying machine that would mimic bats and birds (Taylor 2009).
In more recent years, the quest for biomimetic applications has become a whole 
new feld of study and has resulted in research efforts to fnd biomimicry-based 
innovations. Modern biomimicry essentially aims at understanding the chief prin￾ciples of biological processes or processes related to adaptation of several species 
and then adapting these concepts in innovative product applications or any form of 
applications that will help solve the grand challenges of today (Lurie-Luke 2014).
Amongst notable segments of biomimicry is the edge effects. Edge effects are 
considered one of the “most extensively studied ecological phenomena” (Ries and 
Sisk 2004). In ecology, the edge effect refers to the variation in biotic and abiotic 
conditions that occur at the interface between distinct habitats. More specifcally, 
alterations in species distributions have become a regularity in habitat edges and 
these patterns have been thoroughly studied, so as to understand how any landscape 
interference might affect habitat quality. There have been scholars that have advo￾cated in favour of the positive effects of edge habitats on avian species, as they 
increase in abundance (Lay 1938), but also others that raise the issue of habitat 
fragmentation as a negative impact of, e.g., forest edges, where higher parasitism 
and predator rates are being observed (Brittingham and Temple 1983). However,

Fig. 23.1 The “edge 
effect”. Where two 
ecosystems overlap, the 
overlapping area supports 
species from both plus 
another species that is only 
found in the overlapping 
area (Tanaskovic 2018)
edge effects are always characterised by an increase in diversity of species inhabit￾ing the overlapping ecosystems. This concept has been adopted in the feld of bio￾mimicry, where it is used to understand how organisms adapt to changing 
environmental conditions, with the goal of applying these insights to the design of 
human-made systems that are able to adapt and respond to changing conditions. The 
study of edge effects, as shown in Fig. 23.1, in biomimicry is important because it 
can provide valuable perspectives on how to create systems that are resilient and 
sustainable in the long term.
Mediterranean coastlines are characterised by a variety of natural edge effects, 
which are the changes in the physical, chemical and biological conditions that occur 
at the interface between different habitats. These edge effects are caused by the 
interaction of different natural systems such as the sea, the dunes, the lagoons, the 
salt marshes, the wetlands, the maquis and the forests.
Along the Greek coastline, naturally occurring edge effects can be observed 
between the sea and the coastal dunes, the lagoons and the wetlands. These habitats 
are home to a diverse array of plant and animal species, many of which are unique 
to the Mediterranean region. For example, the coastal dunes and wetlands provide 
important breeding and feeding grounds for many bird species, while the rocky 
intertidal zones are home to a diverse array of marine life, such as fsh, crustaceans 
and molluscs.
The Mediterranean maquis, a type of scrubland found along the coastline, is also 
an important habitat for many species, including reptiles, small mammals and birds. 
The maquis provides important nesting and feeding grounds for many species, and 
is also an important source of food and other resources for human communities.
The edge effects that occur along the Greek coastline are important for maintain￾ing biodiversity and ecosystem health, as well as for providing economic and cul￾tural benefts for human communities. However, these habitats are also under threat 
from human activities, such as development and pollution, which can lead to the 
loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The shortest defnition of the term agroforestry can be taken from the word itself, 
agro – standing for agriculture and forestry – standing for forests and trees; how￾ever, there is a large number of defnitions across continents, some of which have 
been contemporary, whilst others are older.
There is a strong link between agroforestry and biomimicry, in essence the agro￾forestry is using the biomimicry to mimic the virgin forest ecosystem functions and 
elements to increase production, fertility and overall abundance of the system.
The connection between agroforestry and biomimicry lies in the utilisation of 
natural systems as a model for the design and management of agroforestry systems. 
This involves the application of principles derived from the study of natural ecosys￾tems, such as biodiversity, resilience and ecosystem function, to the design and 
management of agroforestry systems. By mimicking the structure and function of 
natural ecosystems, such as virgin forests, agroforestry systems can improve soil 
health, increase crop yields and enhance other ecosystem services. Additionally, 
agroforestry practices can serve as a source of inspiration for biomimicry, as farm￾ers and researchers can observe and learn from the natural systems and apply those 
principles in their own farm management, such as crop rotation, intercropping and 
nutrient cycling, to improve the sustainability and resilience of the agroecosystem.
23.1.1 Agroforestry
Agroforestry is a collective name for land-use systems and technologies where woody 
perennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc.) are deliberately used on the same land￾management units as agricultural crops and/or animals, in some form of spatial arrange￾ment or temporal sequence. FAO
A slightly lengthier explanation is as follows:
Agroforestry – Food forest – Forest garden – Forest farming
There are numerous names that throughout countries and continents describe the 
use of forests mixed with crops producing trees, crops and/or animals, this is to be 
expected as this way of utilising resources is one of the oldest ways humans had 
used agriculture. Among them there are some important differences, however to 
mention and explain all of the recognised approaches in this thesis would be impos￾sible, for that reason the focus here will be on some of the most infuential approaches 
which include Forest gardening, Food forest, Forest farming, Inga alley-cropping, 
alley-cropping, agroforestry and Silvopasture.
Maybe the easiest way to classify them would be from virgin forests to plantations.
Virgin forests or old growth or primavera forests are pure nature, untouched for￾ests, maintained and managed only by nature, forest that distinguish themselves 
with the presence of rotting wood in the soil; then there are partly managed forests 
for timber or crops which would see planned cutting down of trees; the third are 
allay cropping types of different levels of humane interference, sometimes with 
more or less full areas of untouched virgin forest, or in case of Inga alley cropping 
V. T. Gassner et al.409
an alternative for slash and burn, a highly destructive method of agriculture. Then 
there are planted new growth forests, which could be diverse reforestation projects 
with projected human beneft or timber or/and crop producing and the last one 
would be plantations, usually consisting of only one type of trees, monocrop 
plantations.
After this age classifcation the level of management and attention classifcation 
from Forest farming comes up as it seeks to explain the benefts from the forest from 
non- timber forest products. Here we can observe four types of forests, starting from 
least intensive to most intensive: Wild-crafting includes roaming the forest for 
mushrooms and wild-edibles, without any humane involvement in nurturing the 
produce, Forest tending includes planned cutting of trees to help the growth of 
desired species, but no planting is present, Wild-simulated tries to maintain a natural 
environment, while enriching the local non-timber forest products distribution in 
the forest to achieve a greater renewable supply of the products, it is characterised 
by minimal disturbance and natural growing conditions, that ensure that products 
will be similar in taste, appearance and quality to those harvested from the wild￾crafting, and the most intensive way the Forest gardening, which represents the 
imitation of the forest thought heavy input of labour (for such agriculture) in an 
attempt to mimic the natural forest with crop producing trees while utilising all 
seven layers represented in the natural forest.
Out of all the mentioned practices so far Agroforestry is the most recognised. 
Many scholars defne it as a sustainable way of agriculture in the twenty-frst cen￾tury. Agroforestry is mainly described with four “I” approach: intentional, intensive, 
integrated and interactive management (Tanaskovic 2018).
Easily distinguishable are the three main types of agroforestry systems:
1. Agrisilvicultural systems are a combination of crops and trees, such as alley 
cropping or homegardens.
2. Silvopastoral systems combine forestry and grazing of domesticated animals on 
pastures, rangelands or on-farm.
3. The three elements, namely trees, animals and crops, can be integrated in what 
are called agrosilvopastoral systems and are illustrated by homegardens involv￾ing animals as well as scattered trees on croplands used for grazing after harvests.
This simplifed classifcation is often provided by FAO UN.
Greece has traditionally a rich history of agroforestry practices that have been 
shaped by the country’s diverse ecological and socio-economic conditions. Different 
regions of Greece have varying agroforestry systems that refect the local climate, 
soil and vegetation, as well as the social and economic needs of the communities.
Silvopastoral systems, which involve the integration of trees, typically olive and 
fruit trees, with grazing livestock, such as sheep and goats, have been a prevalent 
traditional agroforestry system in Greece, particularly across the Mediterranean 
region. These systems have been widely used for centuries, and have played a cru￾cial role in shaping the Mediterranean landscape. They have been able to sustain 
agricultural production while preserving the environment and it represents a way of 
life for many farmers and communities in Greece.
23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…410
However, these systems have been facing challenges such as the decline of tradi￾tional livestock farming, land abandonment, and changes in land use, especially 
now considering climate change as a big driver of change, we need to mitigate its 
effects and transition to a more sustainable future. Additionally, agrosilvopastoral 
systems, which combine trees, crops and livestock, are also used in Greece, but they 
are less frequent than silvopastoral systems.
It’s worth mentioning that the integration of trees, crops and livestock in agrofor￾estry systems has many benefts for the environment, social and economic aspects, 
and the sustainable development of the regions. Nevertheless, more research is 
needed to understand the current situation and the exact potential of agroforestry 
in Greece.
If we look at the history and origins of agroforestry and its roots, during the 
twentieth century it can be summarised as follows: “In 1930  in Japan Toyohiko 
Kagawa, a Japanese’s pacifst, was highly infuenced by J. Russell Smith’s book 
“Tree Crops – A Permanent Agriculture” started his own movement in forest farm￾ing by advising farmers located up the hill to plant nut trees, feed the pigs with the 
nuts, sell the pigs gaining short and long term income and also preventing nutrient 
loss and erosion. Nearly half a century later in Europe Robert Hart started his own 
movement inspired by Toyohiko Kagawa, a food garden in moderate climates. 
Maybe the most valuable observation to be acquired from Robert Hart’s approach is 
the seven-layer classifcation system later adopted by Bill Mollison and David 
Homeland in the Permaculture. Robert Hart’s seven layers of forest consist of:
1. “Canopy layer” consisting of the original mature fruit trees
2. “Low-tree layer” of smaller nut and fruit trees
3. “Shrub layer” of fruit bushes like berries
4. “Herbaceous layer” of perennial vegetables and herbs
5. “Underground” dimension of plants grown for their roots and tubers
6. “Ground cover layer” of edible plants that spread horizontally
7. “Vertical layer” of vines and climbers
Very distinguishable are silvoarable systems such as alley cropping systems who 
are used in tropics to provide shade for crops and higher yields or like Inga alley 
cropping to prevent the locals to slash and burn the virgin forest in search for new 
arable land, but to provide an easy and effective way of increasing the soil quality 
and better yields as Inga trees (subfamily Mimosoideae) which are nitrogen fxers. 
Silvopastures are another layer of integrating forest and trees management into suc￾cessful agricultural practice as they apply managed grazing and tree production in 
essence. The other terms that appear thought literature especially in Permaculture 
books are Food-Forest or Edible-Forest- Garden, there is also a less know term used 
by a founder of Plants for the future organisation, Ken Fern woodland gardening but 
genuinely all these approaches represent the view that the trees enable better soil 
protection from erosion, washing off of nutrients especially in tropic and to stop 
nutrient depletion. The agroforestry approach is considered a key element in the 
afforestation of the Sahara Desert, as it will give economic beneft to the farmers, 
enhance the soil preservation from sand storms as well as soil built from increased 
V. T. Gassner et al.411
organic matter and soil enrichment thanks to the deep root systems of the trees. This 
approach will prevent soil salinisation and will eventually with proper maintaining 
allow for an effective carbon storage and climate mitigation method, giving farmers 
one more economical beneft of a possibility to go into carbon trading businesses 
(Tanaskovic 2018).
23.1.2 Difference Between Conventional Agriculture 
and Conservational Agroforestry and Horticulture
Currently, the most predominant form of agriculture worldwide is conventional 
agriculture, which means mass planting of monocrop systems heavily reliant on the 
petrochemical industry. Conventional agriculture is a type of farming that typically 
involves the use of large amounts of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and other inputs, 
and the cultivation of monoculture crops. It is often characterised by the use of large 
machinery, irrigation and other forms of mechanisation. The main focus of conven￾tional agriculture is to maximise crop yields, often at the expense of soil health, 
biodiversity and other environmental factors. If we are ever to reach Net Zero and 
go beyond into the regeneration of our Planet, we need to rethink, revise and rede￾sign our entire agriculture systems starting from how we grow our foods, transport 
and preserve them to how we consume them, and what we do with food waste as 
well as the waste from the whole production process.
The downsides of the conventional agriculture system are plentiful, starting 
from biodiversity loss, soil erosion and soil destruction. These typically lead to 
degradation of the nutritional values of agricultural produce produced by conven￾tional agriculture, and hence the associated health problems. On top of that con￾ventional agriculture is characterised by expensive single-use equipment required 
in contrast to multi-purpose equipment advocated for by conservation agriculture 
approaches. To the farmers’ education and their self-recognition as the steward 
and shepherd of nature vs farmers practising conventional agriculture perceiving 
themself as nature’s main opponent and someone in a perpetual fght against pests, 
fungus and soil *(in)fertility, although it is only logical to have insects, fungus 
and soil fertility in a harmonious relation as a main characteristic of a healthy liv￾ing agroforestry-conservational system. However, conventional agriculture has 
steeped deep into our society, starting from milk industry and its mass commer￾cialisation and promotion after the II world war to our current staple foods such 
as corn, soy and rice, which are mostly produced across continents as GMO vari￾eties. These varieties were arguably at the beginning promoted as more pest-resis￾tant or more drought resistant only to be entirely disputed in the feld by 
practitioners.
After the Second World War the world inherited an abundance of chemicals 
made for states of war such as the infamous DDT and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). 
With their employment in conventional agriculture as pesticide and fertiliser the 
infamous Green Revolution began.
23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…412
In the years that followed more and more scientists turned towards chemicals out 
of fear from food depletion and population overgrowth which big businesses used 
to their advantage and so the ear of soil degradation, depletion and destruction 
began. Rachel Louise Carson (1907–1964) scientist and naturalist, the writer of the 
Silent Spring published in 1962, worldwide best seller, which most likely led to the 
US government’s ban on DDT a decade later, was often credited for the launch of 
the world environmental movement. Years that came after this publication saw the 
publication and formation of many now important governing bodies such as the 
International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) 1972, forma￾tion of Permaculture, during this decade Rodale Press published a series of how-to 
books on organic farming encouraging Americans to try this approach themselves 
and Fukuoka’s great book The One-Straw Revolution was published, too.
The next decades welcomed stronger pressure from consumers towards govern￾ment which led to the continuous improvement of organic regulations and norms on 
state, country and continental levels (Tanaskovic 2018).
However even today this is still not enough and the omnipresent petrochemical 
industry is marking increased revenues and increased production, across all conti￾nents and markets but especially in the global south. This led to mass starvations 
across African content in the late twentieth century, leading to academic and litera￾ture masterpieces such as “Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a 
Better Way for Africa”, by Dambisa Moyo. Today it is basically super diffcult to 
evade conventional agriculture produce even if you tried to.
Conservation agriculture, under which umbrella is agroforestry as well as many 
other approaches focused on achieving land degradation neutrality and increasing 
the fertility of the land that is being cultivated. Conservational agroforestry is a 
farming practice that aims to mimic natural ecosystems in order to enhance biodi￾versity, soil health and other environmental benefts. Agroforestry systems integrate 
trees with crops or livestock in a mutually benefcial way. These systems rely on 
natural processes and inputs, such as organic matter and biodiversity, to improve 
soil health and increase crop yields.
In conservational agroforestry the focus is on improving the overall health of the 
ecosystem, rather than just maximising crop yields. This can lead to more resilient 
and sustainable farms, as well as a more diverse and healthy ecosystem. Additionally, 
conservational agroforestry can be benefcial for farmers by reducing their depen￾dence on expensive inputs, increasing their resilience to climate change and improv￾ing their social and economic conditions.
Horticulture, on the other hand, or simplifed gardening from Latin “hortus” 
meaning garden and “colere” meaning to cultivate, focuses on the use of small plots, 
in contrast to agronomy which involves intensive crop farming and large-scale feld 
crop production of grains and forages or forestry involving forest trees and products 
derived from them. Horticulture is a branch of agriculture that involves the cultiva￾tion of plants for ornamental or aesthetic purposes, as well as for food and other 
products. Horticulture includes the production of fowers, fruits, vegetables, nuts, 
seeds, herbs and ornamental plants such as turf, trees and shrubs. Horticulturists 
may also use plant breeding and genetic engineering to create new plant varieties.
V. T. Gassner et al.413
In contrast to conventional agriculture, horticulture often emphasises the use of 
natural inputs and methods, such as organic matter, benefcial insects and benefcial 
microorganisms to maintain healthy soils and plants. Horticulture systems often 
involve the use of polycultures or intercropping, where multiple plant species are 
grown together, which can improve soil health, pest management and crop yields.
Horticultural systems are also known for their aesthetic value. Horticultural 
landscapes can be designed to create beautiful and functional outdoor spaces that 
contribute to human well-being, biodiversity conservation and climate regulation.
Horticulture can also be considered as a form of conservation agriculture, 
because it aims to mimic natural ecosystems in order to enhance biodiversity, soil 
health and other environmental benefts, while also providing economic and social 
benefts for farmers and communities.
Transitioning from the principles and practices of conservation agriculture and 
horticulture to those of algae cultivation would entail a shift in focus from the cultiva￾tion of traditional crops to the cultivation of microalgae in controlled environments 
for the purpose of producing food, biofuels and other value-added products. Such a 
transition would require the adoption of methodologies specifc to the cultivation of 
microalgae, commonly referred to as “algae farming”. Nevertheless, this work sug￾gests that algae farming can be incorporated into conservation agroforestry and can 
even become an integral part of such practices where the conditions are met for both.
23.1.3 Algae and Aquatic Life
Algae are photosynthetic organisms that do not have sprouts, leaves or roots, and do 
not form seeds, fowers or fruits, like higher plants (angiosperms). They form spores 
instead of seeds and some algae species have complex life cycles. Algae can appear 
as simple unicellular forms, colonial, microscopic, flamentous or complex 
branched. The microscopic algae that participates in phytoplankton are called 
microalgae, and the algae that are visible to the naked eye are called macroalgae. 
The majority of algae live in the aquatic environment (sea, lagoons, coastal waters, 
lakes, rivers).
On the contrary to algae, higher plants that live in water are called aquatic plants 
and have a root system either attached to the bottom or foat freely on the water 
surface or inside the water column.
The role of algae on the planet is particularly important. Marine algae release 
about 70% of the oxygen in nature and can sequester up to 70% of the world’s car￾bon dioxide (Chung et al. 2013; Sekerci and Petrovskii 2015). Algae are the ulti￾mate source of food, reproductive refugia and shelter for other organisms in aquatic 
ecosystems. As primary producers, algae constitute the basis of the aquatic food 
web and can absorb and synthesise nutrients and trace metals. Hence, they play a 
particularly important role in the fow cycle of nutrients.
At the same time algae constitute a resource for multiple human needs (Barbier 
et al. 2019):
23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…414
1. A large number of products for daily use (e.g., toothpastes, cosmetics, etc.) con￾tain algae derivatives.
2. They have many applications in medicine and pharmaceuticals.
3. They are used as food supplements for humans and livestock farming.
4. They can be used for wastewater treatment, biodiesel production, while they are 
bio-indicators of the ecological status of aquatic environments.
The algae as autotrophic organisms require inorganic nutrients for photosynthe￾sis and metabolism therefore absorb a wide range of them from their environment, 
typically as simple compounds. Forms of nitrogen (NO2
−, NO3
− and NH4
+), phos￾phorus (PO4
3−) and silicon (SiO2
2
) belong to the category of inorganic nutrients for 
photosynthesis. The content of these substances in the aquatic environment shows 
signifcant spatial and temporal changes and characterises their trophic status.
Nutrient concentrations are very low in unpolluted waters, but very high in most 
temperate rivers. This is due to inputs from agricultural fertilisers, sewage and 
industrial wastes. High concentrations of inorganic elements by the continuous 
nutrient discharging from rivers and urban wastes promote the growth of algae and 
plant biomass, contributing to the creation of eutrophic conditions in the coastal 
ecosystem (Smayda 1990). The main results of eutrophication could be dead zones 
and fsh/invertebrate kills due to the decomposition process of the overabundant 
algae biomass leading to hypoxic waters and large amounts of carbon dioxide.
Nutrient imbalance in the coastal ecosystem has been associated with an increase 
in the frequency of red tides and harmful algal blooms phenomena that cause nega￾tive impacts (Nikolaidis et al. 2005). Because of the increase of nitrogen and phos￾phorus inputs due to eutrophication in coastal waters, the ratio of these nutrients to 
silicate becomes very high. This could favour non-diatom species including several 
harmful and toxic species (Smayda 1989).
This is why reducing nutrient inputs is more necessary than ever and is requiring 
the development of a series of appropriate biomanipulation techniques.
There are various solutions that have emerged to address the threats facing the 
Mediterranean Sea, its coastlines and their edge effects. One approach is conserva￾tion and management of these habitats through the establishment of protected areas 
and conservation programs. This can include measures such as habitat restoration, 
monitoring and research, and education and outreach.
Another solution is the integration of coastal conservation into coastal develop￾ment planning and management. This can involve incorporating conservation goals 
and best practices into coastal development projects, such as tourism and infrastruc￾ture development, to ensure that these activities are sustainable and do not harm 
natural habitats and their edge effects.
Additionally, the development of sustainable tourism that respects the natural 
and cultural heritage of the area can be a way of preserving the coastal habitats 
and their edge effects, while also providing economic benefts for local 
communities.
V. T. Gassner et al.415
Agroforestry can also be used to restore degraded coastal habitats, by mimicking 
the structure and function of natural ecosystems. This can involve the use of native 
plant species, and the integration of trees and other vegetation with crops and 
livestock.
Finally, community-based approaches, such as involving local communities in 
conservation efforts, can be an effective way to ensure that conservation goals are 
met while also addressing the needs and concerns of local people.
It is important to note that conservation and management of the Mediterranean 
Sea, its coastlines and their edge effects is a complex and multifaceted issue, and a 
combination of different approaches is likely to be the most effective.
23.1.4 Proposed Solution
Reducing nutrient inputs in agriculture is becoming increasingly necessary due to 
the negative impacts of excess nutrients on the environment and human health. 
Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, as elaborately explained above, when 
applied in excess, can lead to eutrophication, or over-enrichment of water bodies, 
which can cause a decline in water quality, fsh and other aquatic life, and can also 
produce harmful algal blooms.
To address this issue, there is a growing need for the development of appropriate 
biomanipulation techniques, which are methods that use the manipulation of bio￾logical communities to control or reduce the levels of nutrients in a given ecosys￾tem. Biomanipulation techniques can take many forms, such as:
• Using plant species that are able to absorb and retain nutrients from the soil, and 
then removing those plants from the ecosystem to reduce nutrient levels.
• Introducing or promoting species that are able to consume or decompose excess 
nutrients, such as certain types of bacteria or algae.
• Promoting the growth of species that are able to outcompete or inhibit the growth 
of species that are responsible for eutrophication, such as certain types of 
phytoplankton.
These biomanipulation techniques have been used successfully in many ecosys￾tems, including freshwater and coastal ecosystems, to reduce nutrient levels and 
improve water quality. However, they require a thorough understanding of the spe￾cifc ecosystem and the interactions between different species, as well as careful 
monitoring and evaluation to ensure that they are effective and sustainable in the 
long term.
One such approach is proposed here, harvesting of agricultural nutrient runoff 
with algae to produce new soil amendments for urban and periurban olive tree agro￾forestry systems.
23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…416
23.1.4.1 Nature-based Solutions to Water Management
Apart from the anthropogenic solutions to water management, nature-based ones 
have emerged, providing a promising enhancement. The fve nature-based solutions 
are deemed to be:
– Stormwater management
– Flood protection and risk management
– Implementation of blue-green infrastructures
– Urban water in the feld of food, water and energy ecosystem
– urban water pollution control: constructed wetlands
Possible addition to this could be:
Harvesting of agricultural nutrient runoff with algae to produce new soil amend￾ments for urban and periurban olive tree agroforestry systems.
Agricultural practices often result in the runoff of excess nutrients, such as nitrogen 
and phosphorus, into nearby freshwater ecosystems. When these nutrients enter 
waterways in high concentrations, they can cause excessive growth of algae and 
other aquatic plants. This process, known as eutrophication, can lead to the 
depletion of oxygen in the water, creating hypoxic conditions that are harmful to 
fsh and other aquatic life. In coastal regions, these hypoxic “dead zones” can 
occur when algae and other organic matter decompose, consuming oxygen in the 
process.
One potential solution to this problem is the use of microalgae to harvest excess 
nutrients from agricultural runoff before they enter the coastal zones. Microalgae 
are simple, aquatic photosynthetic organisms that are able to absorb and convert 
nutrients into biomass. By strategically locating microalgal cultivation systems 
in areas with high agricultural production and thus high nutrient runoff, it is pos￾sible to reduce nutrient concentrations in freshwater ecosystems and prevent the 
formation of hypoxic dead zones in coastal regions.
In addition to mitigating eutrophication, harvested microalgae could potentially be 
used as a soil amendment in peri-urban and urban settings. For example, micro￾algae have been shown to improve soil fertility and plant growth when applied to 
soil mixtures, so it could be extended that olive tree orchards in Mediterranean 
and Greek cities could also beneft from such soil amendments.
Therefore, the sixth category of nature-based solutions to water management could 
focus on the implementation and optimisation of microalgal systems for the pur￾pose of regulating nutrient concentrations in freshwater ecosystems, with a par￾ticular emphasis on coastal zones. By understanding the specifc nutrients that 
support algal growth, it is possible to design and locate harvesting systems that 
are most effective at removing excess nutrients from the water. Regular monitor￾ing and measurement can help to assess the effectiveness of these systems and 
identify areas for improvement. Further research and exploration of suitable 
locations for microalgal cultivation systems is necessary in order to fully realise 
the potential of this approach.
V. T. Gassner et al.417
The frst step will involve in-depth exploration of the proposed sixth category of 
nature-based solutions with regards to water management  and it will involve 
comprehending the process of harvesting of agricultural nutrient runoff with 
algae to produce new soil amendments for urban and periurban olive tree agro￾forestry systems. This will be followed by a quest to fnd and analyze the three 
most accessible sites in Greece in order to test the potential of developing soil 
amendments from agricultural nutrient runoff there.
23.2 Materials and Methods
23.2.1 The Analysis of Agricultural Landscape of Greece
The agricultural landscape of Greece is basically a mosaic of diverse crops due to 
different microclimates and soil qualities in each region as can be observed in 
Fig. 23.2. Overall, we can distinguish a couple of patterns. A large part of the North 
and the Central part of the country relies mostly on arable crops. More specifcally, 
Eastern Macedonia and Thrace use 80.2% of the land for arable crops, with cotton 
and tobacco being the most prevalent ones, whereas Central Macedonia grows these 
kinds of crops in 72.6% of its agricultural land. Most common crops in this case are 
wheat, rice, corn, sugar and tobacco. A small 16.8% is used for tree cultivation, with 
peach and apple trees, but also olive trees being the ones that are most cultivated. 
Chalkidiki is the olive tree powerhouse in this category as presented in Fig. 23.3, 
sustaining over fve million tοnnes of olive production.
Western Macedonia, on a similar note, has 74.8% of its land dedicated to arable 
crops. The bulk of these crops in that case are legumes, such as beans, lentils and 
chickpeas. Thessaly is considered the most fertile part of Greece and 74.2% of its 
cultivated land goes to arable crops, with wheat being in the frst place and cotton 
following. 11.7% comprises of tree crops and olive trees are the majority of these 
crops, located mostly in the regional unit of Magnesia.
The arable crops trend ceases to exist in the rest of the regions. Epirus, in particu￾lar, has a virtually equal distribution of arable and tree crops of around 30% each. It 
should be noted here that Epirus is far from being the country’s agricultural power￾house, but has rather low production. Olive trees are the most commonly cultivated, 
with around three million tons of production, followed by mandarins, oranges and 
lemons. Finally, the agricultural production of the south of the region mainly con￾sists of tomatoes and cucumbers.
Sterea Ellada has 49.6% of its land allocated to arable crops, but it’s the tree 
crops and most of all the olive trees that are the lifeline of the region in agriculture. 
The region uses arable land to predominantly grow cotton and wheat, but it’s the 13 
million tons of olive tree production that is the most lucrative agricultural business. 
Garden/greenhouse crops such as tomatoes, cabbages and caulifowers are also 
quite common.

Fig. 23.2 Crops and pasture types per region in Greece
Western Greece has again an almost equal distribution of the two most prevalent 
types of crops and it is again in this case the olive trees that make a difference on its 
agricultural economy. Production here is even higher than the one in Sterea Ellada, 
where over 17 million tons of olives are produced.
In the South, the situation is completely reversed. Peloponnisos and Crete are the 
two most typical examples. Peloponnisos uses 71.1% of its land for tree cultivation 
and olive trees are the chief source of income for farmers there, because they see an 
annual yield of over 41 million tons, followed by over 10 million tons of lemons, 
mandarins and oranges. Crete lies in a similar predicament, with over 38 million 
tons of production from olive trees, but only around two million tons of mandarins, 
oranges and lemons.
Requirements for fertilisers usually depend on a series of factors, among which 
(Pateras 2014):
– Soil conditions and quality.
– Type of agricultural and farming methods used.
V. T. Gassner et al.419
Fig. 23.3 Map of olive tree distribution in Greece by variety
– Amount of nutrients removed during the cultivation process.
– Amount of nutrients absorbed by the crop.
– Nutrient content already in soil.
– Climate, irrigation potential, rainfall, etc.
As it can be understood, one of the critical factors to determine a crop’s fertiliser 
intensity has to do with its properties and more specifcally its capacity to absorb or 
remove nutrients during the cultivation process. Based on the latter, several crops 
have been identifed as the ones that remove the most nutrients (main ones being N, 
P, K). The most intensive are the garden/greenhouse crops, and more specifcally:
– Tomatoes
– Cucumber
– Caulifower
– Bean
– Green pea
– Pepper
– Melon

The most benefcial ones, the so-called nitrogen fxers, are legume crops. 
Legumes are a type of plant that are known for their ability to fx nitrogen in the soil. 
Nitrogen fxing refers to the process by which these plants take nitrogen from the air 
and convert it into a form that can be used by other plants. Legumes have special 
bacteria called rhizobia living in their root nodules, which convert the atmospheric 
nitrogen into a form of ammonia that the plant can use. This process, known as 
nitrogen fxation, helps to improve soil fertility and reduce the need for chemical 
fertilisers. Some common examples of legumes include beans, peas, alfalfa, clover 
and soybeans.
23.2.2 The Soils of Greece and Their Correlation 
to the Agricultural Nutrient Runoff
Another element, as discussed previously, is the composition and quality of the soil. 
An overall view can be seen in Fig. 23.4. According to this map, Greece is a sub￾stantially diverse country, where the following types of soil can be identifed:
– Calcisols: These kinds of soils usually have a large secondary accumulation of 
lime, and are characterised by the presence of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the 
subsoil. They are very characteristic of arid and semi-arid environments and are 
relatively low in nitrogen, relatively poor in organic matter and have a low water￾holding capacity and are prone to drought, which increases the need for fertilis￾ers. Nonetheless, their nutrient run-off is seen as relatively low. They are common 
for olive tree cultivation and this overlap can be seen in Fig. 23.3. and comprise 
11.1% of the Greek soil.
– Cambisols: Types of soil that are characterised by their relatively young age and 
the presence of humus (decomposed organic matter) in the topsoil. They are usu￾ally found in alluvial, colluvial and aeolian deposits and characterised by abun￾dance in nutrients and relatively low nutrient run-off rates. They comprise 38.7% 
of the land.
– Fluvisols: They are mostly common for being situated next to water bodies, 
such as rivers, deltas, foodplains and lakes and their relatively high content 
of organic matter. Fluvisols are considered to be very productive soils, due to 
their high nutrient content and good water-holding capacity. Typically, they 
have moderate to high content of nutrients, such as potassium, phosphorus 
and nitrogen. However, they are also considered to be relatively challenging 
to manage, as they are often subject to fooding, which can damage crops and 
make it diffcult to access the felds. They are located in 24% of the 
Greek soils.
– Gleysols: They are also known as wetland oils and they have very low drainage 
rates, as they hold onto most of the water and nutrients. They cover only 0.7% of 
the Greek land and as a result will not be taken into consideration as potential 
locations.
V. T. Gassner et al.421
Fig. 23.4 The offcial soil map of Greece
– Histosols: These types of soils are characterised by high carbon content, soils 
that are composed mainly of organic materials. They contain at least 20–30% 
organic matter by weight. They are often referred to as peats and mucks and have 
physical properties that restrict their use for engineering purposes. These include 
low weight-bearing capacity and subsidence when drained. They are not typi￾cally used for agriculture or other human activities, but can be used for forestry 
and peat mining. They represent only 0.1% of the Greek land.
– Leptosols: Leptosols are relatively young soils, with low organic content and 
nutrients. Typically, they are shallow soils that exist on rocky, mountainous 
terrains, in areas of low rainfall, and high winds. They are not suitable for most 
of agriculture and have high erodibility. It is found in 8.4% of the country.
– Luvisols: These types of soils have an argic horizon and high clay content. The 
mixed mineralogy, high nutrient content and good drainage of these soils make 
them suitable for a wide range of agriculture, from grains to orchards to vine￾yards. They are generally considered good for agriculture and do not lose nutri￾23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…422
ents easily. Luvisols are technically characterised by a surface accumulation of 
humus overlying an extensively leached layer that is nearly devoid of clay and 
iron-bearing minerals. Below the latter lies a layer of mixed clay accumulation 
that has high levels of available nutrient ions comprising calcium, magnesium, 
sodium, or potassium. They are found in 9% of the country and hence could be a 
good candidate.
– Regosols: They generally tend to have weakly formulated mineral soil and are 
found mostly in arid and semi-arid lands, mainly in polar and desert regions. 
They present great losses in alkaline-related materials and are considered poor 
for agriculture. We see them only in 4.3% of Greek land, but they would be a 
good candidate for application of the solution, as they are suitable for forestry.
– Vertisols: are characterised by a clay-size-particle content of 30% or more by 
mass in all layers of the upper half-metre of the soil profle, by cracks at least 
1 cm wide extending downward from the land surface, and by evidence of strong 
vertical mixing of the soil particles over many periods of wetting and drying. 
Vertisols contain high levels of plant nutrients, but, owing to their high clay con￾tent, they are not well suited for cultivation without painstaking management. 
Typically used for deep-rooted clay tolerant plants: cotton, millet, sorghum, 
groundnuts, fruit trees such as citrus trees. They are found only in 4% of the 
Greek land.
Looking at the soil map of Greece and the aforementioned soil characteristics we 
can start the analysis.
In summary, Cambisols and Fluvisols may not be considered suitable candidates 
for experimentation with algal soil amendments due to their high nutrient content 
and good water-holding capacity, which means that these soils are already rich in 
nutrients and do not need to improve soil fertility and increase nutrient availability.
Observing the soils of wetland and peat origins such as Gleysols and Histosols, 
we can conclude that they are not suitable for experimentation with algal soil 
amendments because they have high water content, poor drainage and are already 
rich in water and carbon matter.
On the other hand, Leptosols are not suitable for experimentation with algal soil 
amendments because they have poor fertility, poor water-holding capacity and high 
erosion risk, and have little or no soil development. These soils are not well suited 
for agriculture and not capable of supporting healthy plant growth.
And the last of undesirable soil types for this experimentation are Vertisols. They 
are not suitable for experimentation with algal soil amendments due to their high 
clay content, high shrink-swell potential and high water-holding capacity, which 
make them less suitable for agricultural use. Algae soil amendments are envisioned 
to be typically used to improve soil fertility and increase nutrient availability in soils 
that are defcient in these areas, which is not the case for Vertisols.
Despite this, it is important to consider other factors such as soil structure, water 
holding capacity, agricultural practices, crops grown and organic matter content 
V. T. Gassner et al.423
should also be considered when determining the suitability of soil for experimenta￾tion with algae soil amendments, and a thorough analysis of the soil should be 
conducted before deciding whether to experiment with algal soil amendments or not 
for the specifc soil type as within the types themselves we could observe height 
variations.
A potential candidate may be Luvisols, as they are known for their mixed min￾eralogy, high nutrient content and good drainage, making them generally consid￾ered good for agriculture. Due to their high nutrient content and good drainage, 
they do not lose nutrients easily. These characteristics make it questionable 
whether these soils need more amendments and if algal soil amendments would 
be a good ft for experimentation in olive orchards. Algae soil amendments are 
typically used to improve soil fertility and increase nutrient availability in soils 
that are defcient in these areas. Luvisols, on the other hand, are already rich in 
nutrients and have good drainage, thus the addition of algae may not provide sig￾nifcant additional benefts.
The ideal candidates are Calcisols, which comprise 11.1% of Greek soil; they are 
known to be common for olive tree cultivation. These soils are characterised by a 
relatively low organic matter content and a low water-holding capacity, which 
makes them susceptible to drought. This can result in an increased need for fertilisa￾tion to maintain adequate nutrient levels for plant growth. However, Calcisols are 
also characterised by a relatively low nutrient run-off, meaning that they do not lose 
nutrients as readily as some other soil types. As such, Calcisols may be suitable 
candidates for experimentation with algae soil amendments. Such amendments 
could have the potential to improve the soil’s water-holding capacity, increase its 
organic matter content and reduce the need for fertilisation.
Regosols are typically characterised by a low fertility and poor soil development, 
making them less suitable for agriculture and only suitable for forestry. Due to their 
poor soil fertility, Regosols may be considered as good candidates for application of 
algal soil amendments. Algae soil amendments could be used to improve soil fertil￾ity and increase nutrient availability and water-holding capacity in soils that are 
defcient in these areas, which is the case for Regosols.
Subsequently, several functional models can be identifed, so that nutrient run￾offs are being exploited in an optimal manner:
– Use the nutrient runoff captured by algae in a region that has predominantly a 
category of Calcisols soil to grow algae that are then going to feed the olive trees.
– Use the nutrient runoff in a region with abundance in olive trees (usually part of 
the aforementioned category as well) to grow algae that are then going to feed 
crops that have high nutrient input needs, such as tomatoes.
– Or use a combination of crops and trees in an agroforestry system in a region 
with Regoslos and Calcisols, where algae soil amendments could potentially 
lead to greatest impacts to the local agricultural production, fnancial and ecosys￾tem benefts.

23.2.3 Rivers and River Basins of Greece and Their 
Correlation to the Agricultural Nutrient Runoff
The following segment of our analysis concentrates on the ramifcations of agricul￾tural nutrient runoff on rivers and their corresponding basins. Nutrients such as 
nitrogen and phosphorus, which are commonly employed as agricultural fertilisers, 
have the potential to infltrate rivers, streams, groundwater and aquifers from sur￾rounding agricultural felds, resulting in a plethora of ecological problems. These 
play a crucial role in our proposed solution as it is a vital component to determine 
which river carries the most substantial amount of nutrient runoff. The river basin 
and the overall catchment area of the basin, including the type of soils and the preva￾lent agricultural practices as well as which crops are mostly planted, will be instru￾mental in identifying which river basin or river has the highest potential to yield 
high results once algae harvesting mechanisms are in place and which will offer the 
most ecological benefts downstream, in our coastal ecosystem. Nutrient runoffs 
can lead to the proliferation of harmful algal blooms, which in turn can cause fsh 
kills and the contamination of potable water, as well as the eutrophication of rivers 
and lakes, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and a decline in water quality. 
Additionally, nutrient runoff has the potential to contribute to the formation of dead 
zones in coastal regions, where oxygen levels are so low that aquatic life is unable 
to survive. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct an in-depth analysis of the 
impact of agricultural nutrient runoff on rivers and their basins, and to devise strate￾gies to mitigate the negative effects.
Greece boasts a relatively limited and dispersed hydrographic network, charac￾terised by the prevalence of short rivers with low fow rates as noticeable in Fig. 23.5. 
The Aliakmonas River, with a length of approximately 297 km, (britannica) repre￾sents the country’s longest river and empties into the Thermaic Gulf. Other notable 
rivers in Greece include the Acheloos River, second longest river with 220 km of 
length which fows into the Ionian Sea, and the Strymon River *(Struma) 415 km 
length from Vitosha Mountain and its catchment area of 10,898 km2
, which empties 
into the Aegean Sea. The country’s rivers as well as lakes and manmade reservoirs 
exhibit a high degree of seasonality, with high water levels observed during the 
winter months and low water levels during the summer. Furthermore, many of 
Greece’s rivers are susceptible to fash fooding.
Starting the river basin analysis with the largest river basin of the Axios (also 
known as Vardar River) River Basin has a drainage area of 24,397 km2
, (britan￾nica) originating from North Macedonia and draining into the Thermaikos Gulf 
of Greece. It also drains parts of Serbia, Bulgaria and northern Greece. The river 
is 373  km long. The basin population is two million inhabitants as of 2015. 
Agriculture is a signifcant economic activity in the basin, with 46.3% of the 
basin being agricultural cropland. The remaining 53.2% is designated urban 
areas and forest. The Axios River (EU KHW1) and its tributaries are an impor￾tant source of water for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. 
Agriculture is a signifcant economic activity in the basin, with crops such as 
V. T. Gassner et al.425
Fig. 23.5 Hydrographic network of Greece: major rivers and river basins
wheat, corn and barley being grown. The region is also home to a variety of fruit 
and nut trees, including apples, pears and almonds. Livestock farming, particu￾larly sheep and goat husbandry, is also prevalent in the region. The intensive use 
of water for these purposes has led to issues of water scarcity and degradation 
of water quality in the basin. Agricultural nutrient runoff is also a signifcant 
problem in the region, which makes this river a suitable candidate for imple￾mentation of agricultural nutrient runoff mechanism.
Aliakmonas River 12,410 km2
 (Nikolaidou et al. 2017) is the largest river basin 
in Greece, characterised by mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. It includes 
the Aliakmonas River and Lake Kastoria. The Aliakmonas River is a river in Greece 
that fows into the Thermaikos Gulf of the Aegean Sea. The river is fed by several 
tributaries, including the Venetikos (Naturagraeca) and Moglenítsas, which drains 
the entire western Thessaloníki plain. Agriculture is an important economic activity 
in the Aliakmonas River basin, with crops such as wheat, corn, tobacco and barley 
being grown in the valley areas. The basin is also home to a variety of fruit and nut 
trees, including apples, pears and almonds. Livestock farming, particularly sheep 
and goat husbandry, is also prevalent in the region. The Aliakmonas River and its 
tributaries are also used for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. Even so, 
intensive use of water for irrigation has led to issues of water scarcity and degrada￾tion of water quality in the river basin. Given the issue of agricultural nutrient runoff 
in the region, this river would be a suitable location for implementing our mecha￾nisms to catch and manage it.
23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…426
The Strymonas River basin in Central Macedonia, Greece, is facing signifcant 
challenges related to water management. These include loss of water from a 
fawed irrigation network, changes in the hydro-period of the artifcial reservoir of 
Lake Kerkini (a designated Ramsar site), and saltwater intrusion in the river dur￾ing the irrigation season due to a decrease in discharge (EU LIFE). These issues 
stem from current water management and farming practices which have signif￾cant impacts on surface waters, groundwater and coastal ecosystems. Additionally, 
the Strymonas River basin also faces problems with pollution from diffuse 
sources, particularly nutrients (NO3-N and PO4-P) in surface waters caused by 
intensive agricultural practices. The use of drainage water for irrigation leads to 
eutrophication of the Strymonikos Gulf and salinisation of downstream agricul￾tural soils. The region is facing a major issue of agricultural nutrient runoff, mak￾ing the river an ideal location for the implementation of our mechanisms to 
mitigate this problem.
The Pinios River basin in Greece is facing pressures on its groundwater resources 
due to agricultural activities, specifcally high nitrate concentrations in the deep 
wells, caused by overuse of fertilisers. A study in western Thessaly showed that 
nitrate concentrations measured in 14 deep wells were very high and sometimes 
exceeded the maximum admissible concentration of 800 μg N/L (EU KHW2). As a 
result, 40% of wells were not drinkable due to high nitrate concentrations. 
Additionally, the expansion of the irrigated area has led to a decline of the water 
table, and it has dropped from a depth of 2 to 5 m below ground to 10-15 m or more 
in the central parts of the basin. Better management of irrigation practices as well as 
being a candidate for the implementation of the agricultural nutrient runoff 
mechanism.
The Mesta/Nestos River sub-basin is a transboundary river shared by Bulgaria 
and Greece. The Mesta (Nestos) River originates in the Rila mountains in southern 
Bulgaria and fows for 230 km through Bulgarian and Greek territory before empty￾ing into the North Aegean Sea. The total catchment area of the river is 5613 km2
(INWEB). The fow of the Nestos River is used for municipal water supply, irriga￾tion and hydroelectric power production. The delta region is protected as a RAMSAR 
site but is in danger due to pollution caused by human activities and large-scale 
hydraulic works (dams). The morphology of the catchment is mountainous and the 
climate is Mediterranean. Three dams have been constructed in the Greek river sec￾tion for hydropower generation and irrigation. The Greek part of the Nestos River 
Basin belongs to three prefectures and comprises 82 communities, with a total pop￾ulation of about 35,000 inhabitants. The region faces a signifcant issue with agri￾cultural nutrient runoff, making the river a suitable location for the implementation 
of mechanisms to address it.
The classifcation of Greek water bodies according to their ecological condition 
as shown in Fig. 23.6 reveals a clear correlation between human activities and areas 
of poor ecological status, the “red zones” which can be attributed to human activi￾ties. This is particularly true in the case of the Bay of Thessaloniki, also known as 
the Thermaikos Gulf, a body of water located in northern Greece. The bay has been 
affected by pollution in recent years due to a variety of factors, including industrial 
V. T. Gassner et al.427
Fig. 23.6 Classifcation of Greek water bodies based on their ecological condition
activities, agricultural practices and municipal waste disposal. In particular, as the 
Bay of Thessaloniki is a key recipient of water from the Axios and Aliakmonas 
River basins, it presents a prime example of this phenomenon. The Axios River 
basin, which encompasses a population of two million individuals including their 
agricultural practices, and the Aliakmonas River basin, which is heavily impacted 
by agriculture, both contribute signifcantly to the pollution present in the 
Thermaikos Gulf. This is evidenced by the presence of pollutants such as heavy 
metals, organic compounds and nutrient inputs in the bay’s sediments and waters. 
The ecological degradation of the Bay of Thessaloniki can be attributed to the 
23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…428
anthropogenic activities present in the surrounding catchment areas. These activi￾ties, along with other factors such as soil type of Regosols, Calcisols and Luvisols 
are present even in small stretches, and olive production, make the area of 
Thessaloniki an ideal location for experimentation with the harvesting of agricul￾tural nutrient runoff from the Axios and Aliakmonas Rivers or both simultaneously. 
Such experimentation could provide valuable insights into the potential for mitigat￾ing the negative impacts of agricultural activities on water quality in the Bay of 
Thessaloniki, and could serve as a model for similar efforts in other regions impacted 
by agricultural pollution.
The same conclusion can be drawn for the Struma and Nestos River deltas, as 
their regions also exhibit poor ecological status. These river deltas, like the Bay of 
Thessaloniki, are impacted by anthropogenic activities in their surrounding catch￾ment areas, including agricultural practices and industrial developments. As such, 
experimentation with the harvesting of agricultural nutrient runoff with freshwater 
algae from these rivers could also provide valuable insights into mitigating the neg￾ative impacts of these activities on water quality in the Struma and Nestos River 
deltas and serve as a model for similar efforts in other regions affected by agricul￾tural pollution.
The Pinios River basin, like the Bay of Thessaloniki, Strymonas and Nestos 
River deltas, also exhibits poor water and groundwater quality. A study carried out 
in Western Thessaly revealed that nitrate concentrations measured in 14 deep wells 
were very high and, in some cases, exceeded the maximum admissible concentra￾tion of 800 μg N/L. As a result, 40% of the wells were not potable due to high nitrate 
concentrations. The delta region of the Pinios River is classifed as an area of poor 
ecological status and there are also seasonal stagnant water bodies, coupled with the 
soil types of Regosols, Calcisols and Luvisols, which have all the desirable charac￾teristics for experimenting with soil amendments. These factors make this region an 
ideal candidate for the implementation of an algae-based mechanism to harvest 
agricultural nutrient runoff as a means of mitigating the negative impacts of agricul￾tural activities on water quality.
23.3 Results
Regions identifed to be suitable for discussion on the implementation of the mecha￾nisms to harvest agricultural nutrient runoff based on the so far criteria:
– Suitable soil type
– River basin
– Water pollution
– Agricultural presence
– Olive tree production
– Population density
V. T. Gassner et al.429
The fve locations identifed as ideal for the implementation of powerful algae￾based soil amendments, due to their agriculturally contaminated river basins, 
include:
1. Magnesia, specifcally the surroundings of Volos
2. Viotia and Fthiotida
3. Thesprotia and Corfu
4. Kozani and Florina (due to the presence of Regosols soil type)
5. Pieria and Thessaloniki surroundings
All of these locations are known for their powerful agricultural production, 
including olive tree production. Additionally, the presence of a large enough popu￾lation as presented in Fig. 23.7, to support the implementation of such mechanisms 
along the river beds is crucial. These locations could potentially beneft from the use 
of algae-based mechanisms to harvest agricultural nutrient runoff, as a means of 
mitigating the negative impacts of agricultural activities on water quality, while 
concurrently enhancing soil quality and supporting agricultural production in 
the region.
Focusing on the three most promising, Kozani and Florina, Pieria-Thessaloniki 
and Volos stand out.

23.3.1 Algae and Aquatic Plants Proposed to Be Used 
in a Harvesting Mechanism for Agricultural 
Nutrient Runoff
The majority of the microalgae species that are observed in freshwater ecosystems 
of Greece are presented in Table 23.1 (Tsiaoussi et al. 2017). According to the avail￾able literature and taken into consideration that the most desired characteristics of 
algae for the use for agricultural nutrient harvesting include higher growth rate and 
productivity, higher tolerance to the possible pollutants and to high concentrations 
of nutrients and absence of any toxic compounds, the most suitable categories of 
microalgae for the proposed nature-based solutions seems to be species of the gen￾era Desmodesmus, Scenedesmus and Cosmarium. Already several microalgal spe￾cies from the aforementioned genera have been applied to various types of 
wastewater treatments (Plöhn et al. 2021).
The freshwater green algal genera Desmodesmus and Scenedesmus are among 
the commonest genera of freshwater algae. They can be found in freshwater bodies 
all around the world and they are easy to grow and handle (Trainor 1998).
The genus Cosmarium includes species that shifted their optima to high concen￾trations of nutrients and various pollutants (Stamenković et al. 2021), thus, some of 
them could possibly be used as adsorbents of excess nutrients.
In terms of harvesting agricultural nutrient runoff, both microalgae or other 
aquatic plants, such as Lemna, can be used to remove excess nutrients from agricul￾tural runoff. This is because both plants are able to absorb and utilise large amounts 
of nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, from the water. The use of micro￾algae or Lemna as a method for removing excess nutrients from agricultural runoff 
is known as “phytoremediation”. This process involves using plants to remove pol￾lutants or excess nutrients from the environment, making the water cleaner and safer 
for aquatic life.
Lemna, commonly referred to as duckweed, is a foating aquatic plant that has 
been utilised for the purpose of harvesting agricultural nutrient runoff. The plant 
exhibits rapid growth and has been shown to effectively remove excess nitrogen and 
phosphorus from waters, to reproduce in a variety of aquatic environments including 
freshwater, brackish water and even sewage treatment ponds. Additionally, Lemna has 
already been explored as a potential source of protein for animal feed and as a biofuel 
source. Its application as a soil amendment has been researched here. The plant is 
known to be able to absorb and retain large amounts of nutrients, such as nitrogen and 
phosphorus, from the water it grows in. These nutrients can then be incorporated into 
the soil when the plant is harvested and used as a form of fertiliser. Duckweed is also 
known for its ability to improve soil structure and aeration, making it easier for other 
plants to grow. Though, further research is needed to fully understand the potential 
benefts and drawbacks of using Lemna as a soil amendment. It is crucial to consider 
the potential invasiveness of Lemna and the potential negative effects on local ecosys￾tems when utilising the plant for these purposes.

Both microalgae and aquatic plants like Lemna can be used in phytoremediation 
systems, but they have different advantages and disadvantages. Lemna is able to 
grow and reproduce quickly, making it well-suited for large-scale phytoremediation 
projects. After all, it can be diffcult to harvest and may require additional steps to 
remove from the water. Microalgae, on the other hand, can be more easily harvested 
and may be more effcient at removing certain types of pollutants or nutrients.
It’s crucial to take into consideration that depending on the specifc context and 
the exact microalgae or aquatic plants species used, the results may vary, and it’s 
crucial to conduct a pilot study and experiment to be able to determine the best 
option. This is why here various microalgae species and their characteristics were 
examined in order to determine which ones are the most suitable for the frst pilot 
project.
Consequently, based on the information presented in Table 23.1, it is not possible 
to arrive at a defnitive conclusion regarding the growth rate, average growth rate 
and capacity for uptake of artifcial fertilisers, as well as the dry matter content of 
each individual microalgae species. Further research is required to determine the 
optimal species. Nevertheless, as the frst step, it is recommended to conduct a pilot 
study using the three species identifed the genera Desmodesmus, Scenedesmus and 
Cosmarium, as well as Lemna from aquatic plants in order to gather additional data.
23.4 Discussion
23.4.1 The Importance of Olive Trees in Greece 
and the Mediterranean
Olea europaea is one of the most important oil crops in the world, cultivated mainly 
around the Mediterranean basin but spreading around the world lately. The ancestor 
olive tree, Olea europaea ssp. europaea var. sylvestris, was found in the Middle East 
V. T. Gassner et al.433
6000 years ago, according to historic and genetic references, and then spread to 
Greece through Asia Minor (Diez et al. 2015), while the exact distribution network 
remains unclear. The systematic cultivation of the wild progenitor for oil production 
led to the domesticated O. europaea ssp. europaea that includes many cultivars. 
Olive belongs to the family of Oleaceae, the order of Lamiales, which includes 600 
species in 25 genera (Obied et al. 2008).
Greece has a very long tradition in olive cultivation and is the world’s third￾largest producer of olive oil and the ffth one of table olives. Greece devotes 60% of 
the cultivated land to olive growing and is the third country in olive oil production 
in the world while the frst in consumption per capita (Barjol 2013). Greece has 
more than 40 olive cultivars (Kalogeropoulos et al. 2014; Roubos et al. 2010) but 
only half of the varieties are widely cultivated and used for olive oil production, 
table olive production or both. Koroneiki cultivar is the most popular Greek variety 
grown for oil, which counts for more than half of the total oil production, producing 
high yields of fruits of small size. The oil from Koroneiki has excellent favour, 
aroma and organoleptic properties (Anastasopoulos et al. 2011).
Many health benefts in humans have been attributed to olive oil consumption, 
due to oil’s fatty acids but especially due to its high polyphenol content. Today, 
Greece counts 19 PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and 12 PGI (Protected 
Geographical Indication) olive oil products, and 10 PDO and one PGI olive cultivars.
In 2020, the global olive cultivation covered an area of 12,763,184 hectares 
(FAOSTAT) of which more than 95% is located in the Mediterranean basin. In 2020, 
the olive production, in the EU-27, was app. 14 million tonnes concentrated in four 
countries, Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. Specifcally, according to FAOSTAT, in 
2020, the EU-27’s olive tree groves covered an area approximately equal to 
5,105,130 hectares, of which, 2,623,720 (51.4%) were in Spain, 1,145,520 (22.4%) 
in Italy, 906,020 (17.8%) in Greece and 379,440 (7.4%) in Portugal.
The combination of mountainous and semi-mountainous landscape in the 
Mediterranean basin and the low levels of humidity are the main factors leading to 
the quality of olives and olive oil products.
23.4.2 The Advantages and Disadvantages of Growing Olive 
Trees in an Agroforestry System
Agroforestry, as explained in the introduction, is a land-use management strategy 
that encompasses the integration of trees, shrubs and other perennial plants into 
productive agricultural forestry systems. Among the perennial plants that are often 
included in agroforestry practices, olive trees stand out as an important species.
Olive trees, Olea europaea, are native to Mediterranean-type climates and can 
provide a range of ecosystem services, such as soil conservation and erosion con￾trol, as well as shade for other less sun-tolerant plant species to thrive under. 
Furthermore, olives can be used as a source of income in the form of oil and table 
23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…434
olives production. Given their longevity and consistent yield, olive trees can also 
serve as a stable source of income for farmers over prolonged periods of time even 
through generations. Overall, the integration of olive trees into agroforestry systems 
can bring multiple benefts to both the environment and human communities.
1. Soil conservation: Olive trees have a strong roots system, whose development 
depends mostly on the soil type the tree is in, therefore roots can vary from 
strong tap-root and shallow, wide-spreading roots, to deep and wide roots. 
Anyhow they can help to improve soil structure and increase water infltration. 
This can help to reduce erosion and improve the overall health of the soil. 
Additionally, the leaf litter and pruning residues of olive trees can contribute to 
organic matter and microbial activity in the soil.
2. Climate regulation: Olive trees can provide shade and cooling to other crops in 
the system, which can help to protect them from heat stress and improve their 
growth and productivity. Additionally, shade trees like olive trees, offer a natural 
protection to excessive temperature variations between day and night and can 
help to reduce the need for irrigation by reducing evapotranspiration and increas￾ing water-use effciency.
3. Biodiversity: Agroforestry systems that include olive trees can support a diverse 
range of wildlife, including birds, insects and small mammals. Olive trees also 
provide a habitat for a range of microorganisms that can contribute to increasing 
soil fertility. Biodiversity of an olive-centred agroforestry system can be achieved 
by managing the herbaceous cover that is proven not to diminish the productivity 
of the olive grove.
4. Economic benefts: Olive trees can live for centuries. It is a crop that can provide 
a consistent income for farmers and their ancestors, considering the average 
lifespan of an olive tree is 500 years (UNI CA). The olives can be used for oil 
production or table olives, both are in high demand, and the long-lasting tree 
helps to ensure a long-term income stream for farmers.
5. Social benefts: Agroforestry systems that include olive trees can support tradi￾tional Greek rural livelihoods and help to maintain their diverse cultural heritage. 
They also can provide employment opportunities in the form of harvest and pro￾cessing for local people.
In an agroforestry system set up for 3  years by a stakeholder group from 
Kassandreia, Chalkidiki they measured “The three year trial demonstrated an 
impressive growth of olive trees, and higher production of olives to that previously 
attained”. The system was set up to be “It comprised three treatments (olive trees + 
barley, olive trees + a mixture of barley and common vetch and, as a control, olive 
trees alone) in three replications in a latin square design” (AGFORWARD).
Bear in mind that agroforestry systems with olive trees can be challenging to set 
up and maintain, as they require a high level of management expertise. Additionally, 
the choice of companion crops should be carefully thought through based on the 
local conditions and site-specifc factors such as soil type and availability of nutri￾ents and water. When choosing companion crops for olive trees in an agroforestry 
system, it’s important to consider the specifc conditions of the site, as well as the 
V. T. Gassner et al.435
management and fnancial goals of the farmer. Some common companion crops that 
are often planted alongside olive trees include:
• Grains: such as wheat, barley and oats, which can be grown as cover crops in the 
early stages of the olive orchard establishment, as well as in the interrows.
• Legumes: such as fenugreek, alfalfa, clover and beans, which can fx nitrogen in 
the soil, improving fertility and the growth of olive trees and other compan￾ion crops.
• Vegetables: such as tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, which can be grown in the 
understory of the olive orchard, taking advantage of the shade provided by the 
trees during the hot summer months.
• Fruits: such as fgs, pomegranates and quince, which can also be grown in the 
understory of the olive orchard. They can complement the income generated by 
olives and provide a diversifed production.
• Herbs: such as dill, anise, rosemary, thyme, oregano and marjoram which are 
well adapted to Mediterranean climates, and can be grown among the trees and 
used for culinary purposes.
It’s important to note that there are many other potential companion crops that 
can be used in agroforestry systems with olive trees, as well as a wide variety of 
edible and ornamental fowers which are very much needed for pollinators in every 
garden, and the choice will depend on the specifc conditions of the site and the 
goals of the farmer. The best companion crops for olive trees should be low￾competing, easy to manage, have low water and nutrient requirements, and can 
provide additional benefts to the system, such as pest control, pollination, or soil 
improvement.
23.4.3 Towards Law and Policymakers
Decision makers and the practitioners that are affliated with them, namely policy￾and lawmakers lie at the epicentre of the innovation landscape. Their interventions 
on the legal and regulatory framework are paramount for their deployment. The 
most important aspect with regard to legislation are the permits to conduct such 
activities on and around the water bodies. The law for utilisation of water bodies 
currently has a provision for their exploitation for irrigation and transportation pur￾poses, or for drilling and for well construction. Whilst harvesting agricultural nutri￾ent runoff can be an additional benefcial outcome to utilisation of water bodies, 
having a clause specifcally for collecting the runoff would certainly facilitate the 
process.
A piece of legislation that is conducive to reducing the environmental footprint 
of agricultural activities, but has room for improvement, is the legislation regarding 
pollution from Nitrates. This law was put in effect, after EU guidelines were issued, 
in 1991 and has several good points. The frst and most important is the creation of 
vulnerable nitrate zones (VNZ), which are the ones that have a substantial amount 
23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…436
of nitrates in their water bodies. This is very useful for farmers, associations and 
companies/organisations that wish to take action against this pollution. The same 
law also provides some good practices that ought to be followed by farmers with 
regard to reducing fertiliser and other environmentally harmful products’ consump￾tion (Ministry of Environment and Climate Change n.d.). Nonetheless, there is no 
provision to incentivise circular practices. Reducing nutrient runoffs to zero will be 
a major challenge and in the meantime focus could be its exploitation and recircula￾tion, bringing this policy in line with the current European agenda of circular econ￾omy, which would undoubtedly of great use to the local farmers and their 
communities. Because, without incentives from decision-makers, local communi￾ties and farmers might see no value in changing their ways.
In addition, since the main water exploitation functions entail activities to use 
water for irrigation and/or drinking, the permit issuance process is a much more 
complex one, at least for individuals to get one. The reason is that the aforemen￾tioned activities are mostly conducted by companies. However, viewing this regen￾erative and circular economy opportunity, it becomes apparent that farmers could 
also become the recipients of such permits and be able to use the agricultural nutri￾ent runoff to create biostimulants for self-use or distribution. A second procurement 
process ought to take place, to provide farmers with the opportunity to exploit their 
agricultural runoff and/ or allow access to the nearby water bodies where the leach￾ing happens.
Connected to the previous point, the legislation also accounts for a series of 
water exploitation locations around Greece, that are indicated according to the ratio￾nale that water will be used only for the foregoing purposes. This location registry 
ought to also be revisioned to account for nutrient runoff harvesting activities 
as well.
A paramount element of innovation-related policies is incentivising stakehold￾ers. The new strategic plan for agroforestry in Greece 2023–2027 has this beneft, as 
it provides fnancial incentives to professionals on the feld for a wide range of 
activities, such as interventions for conservation, regeneration and protection of for￾ests, pasture and agriculture-related innovations, but also activities related to main￾taining biodiversity. This is a very ambitious and well-written plan, nonetheless 
additional attention and fnancing ought to be put to activities related to capacity 
building for farmers, but also to strengthening the dialogue between policymakers 
and farmers, so that the former can understand how they can best cater to the needs 
of the latter. As well as to help farmers utilise the fnancial instruments that are put 
in place by policymakers for achieving such plans.
23.5 Conclusions
This research investigates the agricultural landscape of Greece and indicates the 
regions/locations that are most vulnerable and affected with the agricultural nutrient 
runoffs. Several indicators were used to determine that vulnerability, such as the 
V. T. Gassner et al.437
type of agriculture, the type of crop, the type of soil, the existence of polluted water 
bodies, and also the presence of olive trees in close proximity. The importance of 
the olive tree was highlighted, as, beyond its impact on the local economy, it pres￾ents great benefts for the agroforestry systems, as well as for maintaining biodiver￾sity. Olive trees’ historical and cultural signifcance was addressed, as it has been an 
integral part of Mediterranean culture for centuries, with a rich history of cultiva￾tion, trade and use in cuisine, medicine and religious practices. On the other hand, 
the olive tree is not only an economic crop but also a cultural heritage that has been 
passed down through generations. In addition, due to its resistance to salinity, it is a 
great candidate for applying the biostimulants generated from the agricultural nutri￾ent runoff. Considering that the south of Europe including the Balkans will face 
strong reductions in low fows and experience agricultural droughts that can be 
expected to increase up to seven-fold in the various simulations, reaching over 
700,000 km2
/year, almost twice the area of Germany (Tanaskovic Gassner 2022) it 
is of utmost importance to start addressing and mitigating the risks of drought 
through various applications and mechanisms. Harvesting the agricultural nutrient 
runoff with algae and aquatic plants to utilise this for creating soil amendments is 
one of such applications that would not only bring additional nutrients to the olive 
tree but also prolong the soil water retention capabilities and this puts it on a high 
scale of urgency.
Taking the aforementioned into consideration, Kozani-Florina, Pieria￾Thessaloniki and Volos were chosen as the regions where this innovative approach 
would have the highest impact. The most comprehensive understanding of the pres￾ent state of affairs can be obtained by utilising a combination of overlaid maps on a 
web page, as demonstrated by the use of the CANVA model, created for this pur￾pose. The web page containing these maps is accessible through the reference mate￾rials provided (CANVA). This is expected to become a substantially useful 
contribution for policymakers, so that they can formulate an enabling framework, 
where business ecosystems for production of biostimulants from these circular sys￾tems can be created. In addition, it can also function as a roadmap for academia to 
conduct further research on the feld and generate useful results in topics, such as 
the most ideal freshwater microalgae and aquatic plant cultivation landscape 
in Greece.
23.5.1 Recommendations
Environmental policy has always been deemed as a paramount enabling element for 
innovations to go beyond the niche market and into the socio-technical regime 
(Popp 2019). Innovations in this sector generally require system changes, which are 
interconnected with policy changes and generally affect each other (Geels and Schot 
2007). Taking the aforementioned into consideration, it has great interest and impor￾tance that best policy practices and recommendations for novel approaches in con￾servation agriculture ecosystems are generated. A new policy framework can work 
23 Harvesting of Agricultural Nutrient Runoff with Algae, to Produce New Soil…438
in an enabling manner for groundbreaking projects to take place, which will mini￾mise the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector.
Further research is strongly recommended in the area of freshwater microalgae 
and aquatic plants. This research should focus on obtaining basic measurements and 
understanding the potential for these organisms in biotechnology and industrial pro￾duction, as it allows for the effcient and cost-effective production of high-quality 
products, as illustrated by the data gaps in Table 23.1. Additional studies in this feld 
are essential in order to advance our understanding of these organisms and their 
potential applications.
Our research on the characterisation of soil types in Greece revealed a discrep￾ancy in the offcial soil map percentage distributed by the Greek government. Upon 
conducting mathematical analysis, it was determined that the total percentage 
exceeded 100% and was actually 100.3%. In light of this inconsistency, it is recom￾mended that the responsible government institution conduct a reevaluation and 
release a revised map with corrected numbers.
