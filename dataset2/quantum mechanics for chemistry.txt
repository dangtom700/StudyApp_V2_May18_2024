Modern chemistry was built on quantum mechanical foundations, but the amount 
of time allowed for chemistry students to learn both fundamental principles of 
quantum mechanics and details of its applications to molecular systems is very 
limited. Therefore, instruction of quantum mechanics in typical undergraduate and 
graduate chemistry curricula has been fairly limited in its depth. Rather, the focus 
of conventional physical chemistry or quantum chemistry education has been more 
on mastering facts and data resulting from applications of quantum mechanics that 
are essential for developing key chemical intuition and reasoning ability. However, 
in this age of unlimited accessibility to huge amount of data, the role of course 
instruction as a means to deliver comprehensive information can be relieved to a 
large extent. On the other hand, the need to lay a strong conceptual foundation 
remains irreplaceable and may have become even more important considering the 
demand for reasoning skills to assess information and data critically. This is the 
main motivation for writing this book. 
As the title Quantum Mechanics for Chemistry suggests, this book intends to 
provide standard lessons on quantum mechanics as completely as possible, but also 
focuses on helping readers understand implications and applications of those lessons 
for molecular sciences. Thus, for example, standard lessons on quantum mechanical 
vibration, rotation, and hydrogen-like systems are combined with key principles and 
ideas of related spectroscopies in same chapters. 
An important feature of this book is that the Dirac notation is introduced in a 
rather abstract manner and as completely as possible from the outset. This is because 
the Dirac notation serves as the most effective language to describe most quantum 
mechanical ideas and is the major notation being used for research level publications 
in physical chemistry and quantum chemistry. 
Significant effort has also been made to provide clear quantum mechanical 
understanding of subtle and qualitative details of atomic and molecular properties, 
based on ideas and approximations that are as simple as possible. These lessons are 
then complemented by presentations of more advanced theories and computational 
methods in Appendices or later chapters of the book. 
vii viii Preface 
A unique feature of this book is that lessons that are not treated in most quantum 
chemistry textbooks such as general derivations of Fermi’s golden rule, path integral 
approaches, and open system quantum dynamics theories are included while also 
providing reasonable description of electronic structure calculation theories. This 
is because new directions of research call for more balanced and comprehensive 
understanding of the structure, the energetics, and the dynamics of molecular 
systems altogether. 
Intended readers of this book are upper level undergraduate chemistry students 
or beginning graduate students. Chapters 1–9 can be used as a text or reference for 
undergraduate level physical chemistry course. Chapters 1–11 can be used as a text 
for the first year graduate level quantum chemistry course. Chapter 12 is to provide 
preliminary lessons for those who plan to pursue theoretical and computational 
research in physical chemistry and chemical physics. This book can also be a 
useful reference for physics students and researchers who are interested in learning 
molecular quantum mechanics and quantum dynamics methods. 
This book is an outcome of notes that I have developed for 17 years while 
teaching both undergraduate and graduate level quantum chemistry classes at 
Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York 
(CUNY), but major undertaking of writing this book started during the COVID-19 
campus lockdown in 2020. Final completion of this book became possible through 
supports from the Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) for summer visit 
through its KIAS scholar program and from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science 
and Technology (KAIST), in particular the KAIX program, for my sabbatical stay 
in Fall 2022, during which I also taught a graduate level quantum chemistry course 
for students at KAIST. 
Hardly anything presented in this book is original. Most standard contents were 
developed from textbooks and references that I used to learn and teach physical 
chemistry and quantum chemistry. Key references that I should mention here are 
Quantum Chemistry by McQuarrie [ 1], which was used for developing Chaps. 3–9; 
Quantum Chemistry by Levine [2], which served as an amazing reference for all 
the details of theories and methods that can be taught for quantum chemistry class; 
and Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry by Schatz and Ratner [ 3], which helped me 
learn broad subjects of quantum mechanics used in chemistry and also motivated 
the choice of the title of this book. In addition, many ideas for lessons originated 
from well-known books on quantum mechanics [ 4–8], group theory [9, 10], physical 
chemistry [11–13] quantum/computational chemistry [14, 15], and some books on 
advanced topics [16–18]. 
Completion of this book would not have been possible without assistances from 
Dr. Murali Devi who read manuscripts carefully and offered numerous valuable 
comments, Dr. Pablo Ramos who provided many key figures/illustrations and 
suggestions for improving Chap. 11, and Taner Ture who also provided many 
important figures and validated many equations. I also would like to thank all 
the students at Queens College and the Graduate Center of CUNY and at KAIST 
who took my classes and provided valuable feedbacks. In particular, YoungKyun Preface ix 
Ahn, Junsoo Lee, Sowon Kim at KAIST are appreciated for providing important 
comments on earlier versions of the manuscript for this book. 
Supports from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, 
and the Camille Dreyfus foundation for my research and teaching all have made 
significant contributions to the development of this book. Encouragements and 
comments from my colleagues and intellectual mentors also have played important 
roles. In particular, I would like to thank Profs. George Schatz, Jeff Cina, Jae Woo 
Park, Weita Yang, and Greg Voth, and Dr. Qin Wu for their positive feedback and 
comments. Profs. Changbong Hyeon at KIAS and Young Min Rhee at KAIST 
are also appreciated for hosting my visits and valuable comments. I also would 
like to thank Sam Harrison of Springer Nature for generous consideration and 
encouragement of this book. Most of all, my family’s support and love gave me 
lasting power to work on this book project.

Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum 
Mechanics 
To exist is to be free from contradiction. 
— Henri Poincare 
Abstract This chapter introduces key concepts, major assumptions, and basic 
formulations of quantum mechanics. For contextual understanding, assumptions 
of classical mechanics are clarified first. Then, light quanta, material wave, and 
uncertainty principles are explained. The wavefunction and Schrödinger equation 
defined in a one dimensional space are introduced along with their major properties. 
The chapter concludes with a solution of a quantum particle in a one dimensional 
box in order to illustrate the major concepts and ideas of quantum mechanics. 
1.1 Assumptions of Classical Mechanics 
Before the development of quantum mechanics, classical mechanics was believed 
to explain the state and the dynamics of all physical objects. The assumption behind 
this belief was that it should be possible to represent any physical object as a 
collection of classical point particles, whereas fields such as electromagnetic waves 
act as agents for forces and are governed by laws that are also well understood. 
1.1.1 Classical Point Particles 
A point particle in classical mechanics is completely specified by its position 
and momentum that can be determined simultaneously and precisely. Then, such 
information can be used for solving the Newtonian equation of motion for the 
particle (or Hamilton’s equations in more general terms), so as to predict or retrodict 
its position and momentum at another time. In other words, according to classical 
mechanics, the position and momentum of a point particle, once known completely 
at a given time, can be determined fully at any past or future time. The rest of issue

12 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics
in understanding the physical world then falls down to finding out the way a given 
object can be represented as a collection of point particles and determining all the 
forces (or potential energies) governing the dynamics of these particles. 
For example, consider a point particle with mass m in one dimension. The 
position and momentum of this particle at a given time t are x(t) and p(t), 
respectively. Assuming that there are no other degrees of freedom interacting with 
this particle and that the force on this particle depends only on the value of position, 
they can be shown to satisfy the following coupled equations of motion: 
dx(t)
dt = p(t)
m , (1.1) 
dp(t)
dt = F (x(t)) = −dV (x)
dx




x=x(t)
, (1.2) 
where V (x) is the potential energy of the particle at position x. Combination of the 
above two equations of motion results in the familiar Newtonian equation of motion 
involving the acceleration,a(x(t)) = F (x(t))/m. 
Solving Eqs. (1.1) and (1.2) along with known values of position and momentum 
x0 and p0 at a certain timet = t0, one can obtain the position and momentum at any 
other time, x(t; x0, p0) and p(t; x0, p0). This results in a completely deterministic 
trajectory of the particle in the abstract space of position and momentum, which 
is called phase space. Along the trajectory of the particle in phase space, the 
Newtonian equation of motion ensures that the following Hamiltonian of the particle 
remains a conserved quantity. 1 
H (x, p) = p2
2m + V (x). (1.3) 
This can be proved directly using Eqs. ( 1.1) and (1.2) as follows: 
d
dt H (x(t), p(t)) =

dx(t)
dt
∂H (x, p)
∂x + dp(t)
dt
∂H (x, p)
∂p 
x=x(t),p=p(t)
= p(t)
m
dV (x(t))
dx(t) − dV (x(t))
dx(t)
p(t)
m = 0. (1.4) 
Thus, the trajectory determined by the Newtonian equation of motion is the one 
conserving the Hamiltonian, which in general can be considered as the energy of 
the particle expressed as a function of position and momentum. 
At this point, it is important to note that the point particle, the limit of an object 
with negligible spatial extent, is a mathematical idealization in classical mechanics.
1 For more general and complete account of classical mechanics, refer to advanced textbooks on 
classical mechanics, for example, by Goldstein [ 19]. 1.1 Assumptions of Classical Mechanics 3
However, for the description of realistic objects with significant spatial extent, it is 
possible to devise a limiting procedure that divides the body into as small volume 
elements as possible so that each of the volume element can be treated like a point 
particle. Thus, as long as any object can be represented by a collection of finite or 
infinite number of interacting point particles with precisely determinable positions 
and momenta, it should be possible to completely understand the state and dynamics 
of the object on the basis of classical mechanics. 
The advance of chemistry and physics in late nineteenth century revealed that all 
materials consisted of interacting atoms and molecules that can serve as ultimate 
building blocks of point particles. Thus, the reality of the physical world as 
portrayed by classical mechanics appeared to be all but confirmed. 2 An important 
exception to such description was light, or more broadly, the electromagnetic field. 
For this, Maxwell has already compiled and refined four distinct equations, now 
known as Maxwell’s equations, which provide a complete description of an electro￾magnetic field in space and time and the manner of its interaction with materials. 
However, the question of how electromagnetic waves interact with materials at the 
atomic and molecular level was never clearly understood. Furthermore, detailed 
properties of individual atoms and molecules and those of subatomic particles such 
as the electron and the proton had yet to be understood well. 
1.1.2 Wave: Classical View 
What is a wave? A wave is characterized by a periodic motion of amplitude, in 
general, both in time and space, which can be standing or traveling, regardless of 
whether we can see them directly or not. One of the simplest wave equation in one 
dimension is 
 1
v2
∂2
∂t2 − ∂2
∂x2

u(x, t) = 0, (1.5) 
which is a partial differential equation with f (x ± vt) as a general solution. A 
well-known class of functions that can represent these solutions are sine and cosine 
functions. For example, the following sine function can easily be shown to be the 
solution of the above equation: 
u(x, t) = A sin(k(x − vt)) = A sin 
2π(x
λ − νt)
. (1.6)
2 Indeed, outcomes of many modern computational simulations have confirmed that much of 
material systems we know of can be accurately described in terms of classical mechanics for 
molecules represented as a set of interacting point particles as long as all forces are determined 
accurately. 4 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics
Fig. 1.1 Illustration of an electromagnetic field propagating along the z-direction withϕ = 0
In the above expression, A is an amplitude, k is a wavevector, and v is the speed, or 
the magnitude of the phase velocity, of the wave,λ is wavelength, andν is frequency. 
The above equation implies the following relationships between these quantities: 
k = 2π
λ , (1.7) 
ν = kv
2π , (1.8) 
v = λν. (1.9) 
The speed of the electromagnetic wave in vacuum, denoted as c, has the value 
of 2.99792458 ···× 1010cm/s. If we define the direction of the propagation of the 
electromagnetic wave as the z-direction, the electric and magnetic field components 
of most commonly used forms 3 in vacuum are (see Fig. 11)

where ex and ey are directions along which the electric and magnetic field 
components oscillate, ϕ is an arbitrary phase factor, and the wavelength λ and 
frequency ν are related to the speed of light c through the following relationship: 
c = νλ. (1.12)
3 These correspond to one particular polarization direction of traverse wave in Coulomb gauge. 1.1 Assumptions of Classical Mechanics 5
For an electromagnetic wave, its mass and position cannot be defined like a 
classical point particle. However, a well-defined concept of the energy density for 
the wave, which is consistent with experimental results, exists. The energy of a wave 
is the energy associated with filling up the space with the wave. The exact expression 
for the energy density depends on the specific units of choice, but it can always be 
expressed as a linear combination of E2 and B2. Thus, the energy of the (classical) 
electromagnetic wave increases as the square of their amplitudes. For example, in 
Gaussian units, the energy density of an electromagnetic wave is 
E = 1
8π

E2 + B2

. (1.13) 
This expression implies that the energy of an electromagnetic wave depends on 
the square of its amplitude and can be made as small as possible. It turns out 
that abandoning this definition of energy density has become the starting point of 
quantum mechanics. 
1.1.3 Particle Versus Wave 
The dichotomy of the physical world into those of particles and waves, thus into 
full locality and non-locality, appeared to be intact until the late nineteenth century. 
However, with the progress of experimental capability, puzzling evidence that 
could not be explained in terms of known physical laws and concepts started to 
emerge. In retrospect, this is not surprising because the assumptions and concepts 
of classical mechanics and electromagnetism relied on observations of macroscopic 
phenomena, which then became idealized through mathematical abstraction. In fact, 
there was no guarantee that the physical behavior at atomic and molecular scale 
should obey the same law as those we observe with our senses directly. 
Contrary to what was firmly believed, the key assumption of classical mechanics 
that (i) both position and momentum of any object can be determined with arbitrary 
precision had never been confirmed with sufficient accuracy for particles with very 
small mass. Another important assumption implicit in both classical mechanics and 
electromagnetism was that (ii) the magnitude of the energy of a particle or the energy 
density of an electromagnetic wave can be made arbitrarily small in a continuous 
manner, without restriction. Discoveries of subatomic particles such as the electron 
and the proton proved the existence of indivisible units in mass and charge, but it 
was still too difficult to test whether the two assumptions (i) and (ii) were valid 
for such particles in the early days of those discoveries. On the other hand, solid 
experimental findings for light and its interaction with electrons were recognized as 
not being consistent with classical theories, which made it necessary to examine the 
two assumptions (i) and (ii). It turned out that not only these assumptions but even 
the classical concept of particle versus wave needed to be altered in a fundamental 
manner, which then led to new concepts and ideas of quantum mechanics.6 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics
1.2 Concepts of Quantum Mechanics 
1.2.1 Blackbody Radiation 
What is light? How does light interact with matter? Pursuing answers for these 
questions has motivated the development of key concepts and principles of quantum 
mechanics. The beginning of this was Max Planck’s success in explaining the energy 
distribution of light radiated from a blackbody. 
A blackbody is a perfect absorber. The light that comes out of it is in full 
equilibrium with the body at a given temperature (see Fig. 1.2). The most puzzling 
experimental result concerning the blackbody radiation was that the measured distri￾bution of light energy intensity in the high frequency region was drastically different 
from theoretical prediction based on Eq. ( 113). Experimentally, the light energy 
density reaches a maximum at certain frequency and decays to zero as the frequency 
increases. On the other hand, according to Eq. ( 1.13), such behavior is impossible to 
understand because the light wave should be packed more densely, namely with 
more modes of wave, as the frequency increases (wavelength decreases). This 
results in the energy density increasing as a quadratic function of its frequency, and 
thus leads to a hypothetical catastrophic behavior called ultraviolet divergence. On 
the other hand, the actual distribution of light energy coming from the blackbody 
has vanishing density as its frequency increases. 
In an effort to solve the mystery of the blackbody radiation, Max Planck came up 
with an idea that the energy of light emitted from a blackbody is always quantized, 
which turned out to be one of the greatest discoveries in physics. He showed that the 
experimental data on blackbody radiation can be explained by a single assumption 
that the energy of light is an integer multiple of its frequency times a universal 
constant as follows: 
Elight = nhν, n = 1, 2,..., (1.14) 
Fig. 1.2 Illustration of a 
blackbody. Light gets 
absorbed into the body and 
remitted numerous times 
before they make way out 
through the small hole1.2 Concepts of Quantum Mechanics 7
where h = 6.626 ···× 10−34 J · s and ν is the frequency of light. The fundamental 
constant h is now known as the Planck constant and can be considered as the unit of 
the action4 of light. 
Equation (1.14) represented a drastic departure from known concepts and 
principles that were believed to provide a complete description of light. It was 
firmly believe that the energy of light, as an electromagnetic wave fully describable 
by Maxwell’s equations, can have arbitrary magnitude according to Eq. ( 1.13). 
However, this very assumption was simply an outcome of human perception of 
waves observable at macroscopic scale. In fact, the energy of light turned out to 
be a quantity that can be defined in a new way without affecting the validity of 
Maxwell’s equations. 
The acceptance of Eq. (1.14) even by Planck himself was a reluctant one. Ini￾tially, this was proposed as a remedy specific for fixing the “ultraviolet divergence” 
of the blackbody radiation. It was indeed possible to explain the blackbody radiation 
very accurately on the basis of Eq. ( 1.14), after accounting for some effects of 
statistical and geometric factors. As yet, Planck himself at the time of this discovery 
was not sure whether Eq. ( 1.14) was due to the specific nature of interaction between 
heated oscillators within the blackbody and the light trapped inside or whether it 
indeed represents an intrinsic property of light. 
1.2.2 Photoelectric Effect and Photon 
The simplest interpretation of Eq. ( 1.14) is that light is a collection of independent 
particles, each with energy hν. Albert Einstein used this concept of “packets of 
light” energy, which were named as photons later, and successfully explained a 
photoelectric effect that was difficult to understand with classical theories. 
When light hits a metal surface, some electrons can be ejected from the surface. 
If one assumes that such phenomenon occurs as a result of the activation of electrons 
in metal surface by the driving of classical electromagnetic field, the ejection 
of the electron should depended entirely on the intensity of light. However, the 
experimental observation was that only the number of ejected electrons depended 
on the intensity of light. Careful analyses of experimental results established that 
(1) whether electrons are ejected or not and (2) the magnitude of the kinetic energy 
of the ejected electron depended only on the frequency of light, not the intensity of 
light. These can be summarized by the following relationship:
4 Action is a rather abstract physical quantity originally introduced in a reformulation of Newtonian 
Mechanics and is defined as the product of momentum and position or that of energy and time. In 
other words, it is a cumulation of the energy of a certain physical “action” over certain duration of 
time. 8 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics
hν = 1
2
mev2 + , (1.15) 
where ν is the frequency of the incident light, me is the mass of electron, v is the 
speed of ejected electron, and is the work function of the metal. 
Both the blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect can be explained in 
the simplest possible manner by assuming that light indeed consists of independent 
photons, each with energy hν. Then, what is the implication of this interpretation 
with regard to all other existing experimental evidences supporting the wave-nature 
of light? Since the two views of light as wave and particle are based on well￾established experimental evidences, one compromising solution is that light can 
be viewed as either particle or wave depending on experimental condition and 
measurement type. But is this logically possible? It turns out that the answer for 
this can be yes as long as each photon retains the full characteristics of wave. 
Once the notion of photon as a light particle is accepted, 5 the natural question 
that arises is what is its physical properties. First, the energy of a single photon is 
simply given by 
Eph = hν. (1.16) 
Since light has zero rest mass and travels with a constant speed c in vacuum, 
the same property should be shared by each photon. According to the theory of 
relativity, the momentum of light with energy E is given by E/c. Therefore, it is 
easy to find that the momentum of a photon is given by 
pph = h
ν
c = h
λ
, (1.17) 
where λ is the wavelength of the photon. Thus, there is an inverse relationship 
between the momentum and the wavelength of a photon. 
1.2.3 de Broglie’s Postulate of Material Wave 
Considering that light can be viewed as either wave or particle depending on the 
physical situation, it is natural to ask whether the same is true for objects that have 
been established as particles. If that is the case, what would be the characteristics 
of such a wave? Equation ( 1.17) shows that there is clear relationship between 
momentum and wavelength for the case of a photon. Can this relationship also
5 However, the meaning of photon and the necessity to define it had been debated even after full 
development of quantum theory because most interaction with light could be explained in terms of 
assumption of classical wave before the advance of laser and modern quantum optics experiments 
[20]. 1.2 Concepts of Quantum Mechanics 9
be used for any particle? Indeed, de Broglie suggested that it can be used for 
any material, and supposed the existence of material wave with the following 
wavelength: 
λdB = h
p, (1.18) 
where p is the magnitude of the momentum of the particle. 
de Broglie’s suggestion of Eq. ( 1.18) was extraordinary in the sense that it 
was made without any experimental backing at all. Soon it became a reality 
through confirmation by the Davisson-Germer’s experiment [ 21], according to 
which a beam of electrons passing through a nickel foil showed diffraction pattern 
corresponding to a wave with the de Broglie wavelength of an electron. Even with 
such confirmation, the full physical meaning of de Broglie’s material wave remained 
unclear, except that it linked particle with some kind of wave properties. Genuine 
understanding of this required development of a comprehensive theory. 
As will be detailed later in this book, de Broglie’s material wave also serves as 
a good justification for Bohr’s quantization rule for explaining energy levels of an 
electron in a hydrogen atom. It can also serve as an essential component for proving 
and demonstrating Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Most importantly, it can be 
viewed as the precursor of Schrödinger’s theory of wave mechanics, now known as 
quantum mechanics. 
1.2.4 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle 
Upon further reflection on the nature of physical observables from a deeper 
philosophical viewpoint, namely, from the view that any given physical observable 
has its true meaning only to the extent of “definite experiment” by which it can 
be determined, Heisenberg reached a conclusion that there has to be an intrinsic 
limit in the accuracy of the position and the momentum that can be determined 
simultaneously. His initial estimate was that the lower limit for the simultaneous 
indeterminacy or uncertainty is xp ∼ h, where x and p are uncertainties of 
the values of the position and momentum. This relationship is also consistent with 
de Broglie’s theory given that x ∼ λdB and p ∼ p. 
Heisenberg recognized that the uncertainty is a fundamental limit that cannot 
be overcome by any improvement of experimental precision. He viewed this as 
the only way for the principle of causality, a fundamental cornerstone in any 
scientific reasoning, not to be violated while accepting wave-like nature of particle. 
Heisenberg also came up with a similar relationship between the energy and time, 
namely, that the minimum of the product of uncertainties of the energy and time is 
about Et ∼ h. However, the physical origin and interpretation of this is different 
from that between position and momentum. Following a suggestion by Niels Bohr,10 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics
who strongly believed this as reflecting the dual nature of particle-like and wave-like 
properties that quantum objects have, Heisenberg termed these relationships as the 
uncertainty principle. 
An exact statement of the uncertainty principle, which was clarified later through 
a well-defined mathematical analysis, corresponds to the following inequality: 
xp ≥
h¯
2
, (1.19) 
where h¯ = h/(2π ) = 1.0551 ···× 10−34J s. In the above expression, x and p
are defined as standard deviations from average values of position and momentum 
being measured at the same time. In fact, this relationship is not confined to only 
between position and momentum. Similar relationships can be found for any pair of 
observables that cannot be determined simultaneously. 
1.2.5 Wave-Particle Duality 
Niels Bohr’s contribution to quantum mechanics goes far beyond the model of a 
hydrogen atom.6 He laid out a fundamental conceptual basis for quantum mechanics 
along with Max Born by developing a key concept of the duality of particle and 
wave nature. He viewed that the concepts of particle and wave, taken separately, are 
not sufficient for describing physical phenomena in the quantum limit, but that they 
rather have to be combined together for a full description because they in fact play 
complementary roles. 
The concept of wave-particle duality is easy to misunderstand or misinterpret. 
Even what Bohr meant by this remains not fully understood because he never agreed 
with others’ interpretation of his view on this concept [ 22]. It is however easy to say 
what it is not. The concept of duality certainly does not imply that a small object 
such as electron suddenly becomes particle or wave depending on physical situation 
and the type of measurement. This would break the principle of causality, which 
ensures that there is objective reality that proceeds by a well-defined cause and effect 
relationship, a principle that serves as one of the two most important cornerstones 
of physics along with that of energy conservation. 
In order for the concept of wave-particle duality to be consistent with the 
principle of causality, both properties of particle and wave should remain as intrinsic 
possibilities that can show up when an appropriate projection (measurement) is 
made while being governed by an objective causal relationship. It is important to 
recognize that the concepts of particle and wave are born out of human perception 
of the physical world, and are not guaranteed to be the best means to describe
6 We will go through more details of this when we study hydrogen-like systems. 1.3 Schrödinger Equation (in One Dimension) and Probability Amplitude 11
the quantum phenomena. Understanding what the duality really means remains an 
important philosophical question that goes beyond the scope of this book. 
At the minimum, the duality means that we should abandon the simple concept 
of particle and wave that can be visualized easily as in classical theories. Rather, it is 
much more convenient to assume that there is a certain quantum state with unknown 
characteristics to be specified, which appear to have particle-like properties or 
wave-like properties depending on the types of physical measurement being made. 
Heisenberg assumed that such a quantum state can be represented by a complex 
valued vector in an abstract space. On the other hand, Schrödinger introduced a 
wavefunction, which turned out to embody the dual nature of particle and wave in 
the most precise way. This will be described in more detail in the following section. 
1.3 Schrödinger Equation (in One Dimension) 
and Probability Amplitude 
Shortly after Heisenberg developed the theory of quantum mechanics in terms 
of matrix equations, Schrödinger completed an alternative mathematical theory 
by introducing the concept of wavefunction, which represents a general quantum 
mechanical state, and identifying a powerful partial differential equation that allows 
its full specification. 
1.3.1 Wavefunction and Time Dependent Schrödinger 
Equation 
Given a wavefunction ψ(x, t), a complex valued function of position and time, 
representing a quantum mechanical state of an object or system, the time dependent 
Schrödinger equation that determines its time evolution in one dimension is given 
by 
ih¯
∂
∂t ψ(x, t) = − h¯
2
2m
∂2
∂x2 ψ(x, t) + V (x)ψ(x, t), (1.20) 
where m is the mass of the object that the wavefunction represents and V (x) is 
the potential energy it is subject to. This potential energy is assumed to be time 
independent in the above expression but can be extended to time dependent cases. 
The peculiar nature of ψ(x, t) is that it is in general a complex valued function. 
An example is eikx−iωt = cos(kx − ωt) + i sin(kx − ωt). The physical meaning 
of the wavefunction has been under intense debate during the formative period of 
quantum mechanics. The standard interpretation that is now well-established is that 
ψ(x, t) gives the probability to find a quantum mechanical particle as prescribed 
below.12 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics
Implication and Properties of Wavefunction 
For a system represented by a wavefunction with its value ψ(x, t) at x and at 
time t, the probability to find the system is as follows: 
|ψ(x, t)|
2dx : Probability to find the system between x and x + dx at time t
It is important to note that the above interpretation is consistent with the 
concept of the wave-particle duality and the principle of causality. The former 
is ensured by the probabilistic nature of the wavefunction and the latter is 
guaranteed by the fact that the time dependent Schrödinger equation governs 
its time evolution deterministically. 
There are two important properties a wavefunction should satisfy. 
• A wavefunction for a bounded system is normalized 7 as 
	
R
|ψ(x, t)|
2dx = 1, (1.21) 
where R is the region where the wavefunction is defined. The normaliza￾tion condition exists because the total probability has to be equal to one. 
• A wavefunction should be continuous in space. This is because the 
probability density has to be defined uniquely at any point in space. It is 
important to note that the wavefunction becomes zero in the region where 
the potential becomes infinite. 
7Bounded system means that the potential energy renders the particle to be localized at a 
region of finite volume. For unbounded systems, a different convention for normalization is 
used. 
1.3.2 Measurement as Mathematical Operation 
on Wavefunction 
An important assumption in Schrödinger’s formulation is that measuring a physical 
property of a quantum mechanical state can be represented by a “mathematical” 
operation on the wavefunction. For example, the operation corresponding to a 
position measurement is represented by the following simple multiplication: 
xψ(x, t) ˆ = xψ(x, t). (1.22) 
In the same way, measuring any function of position A(x) simply amounts to 
multiplication with this function. In other words, the operation of A(ˆ x)ˆ is defined as1.3 Schrödinger Equation (in One Dimension) and Probability Amplitude 13
A(ˆ x)ψ(x, t) ˆ = A(x)ψ(x, t). (1.23) 
Note thatxψ(x, t) and A(x)ψ(x, t) are not constant multiples ofψ(x, t) in general. 
Thus, measurement of this position dependent physical observable changes the 
quantum state in general. The exception for this is when the wavefunction is fully 
localized at one specific point, for which a special definition of function is needed 
as will become clear later in this chapter. 
On the other hand, the measurement of momentum turns out to be a differentia￾tion given by 
pψ(x, t) ˆ = h¯
i
∂
∂x ψ(x, t). (1.24) 
For the case where ψ(x, t) ∼ eikx−iωt , which represents a complex valued wave 
with definite wavelength λ = 2π/k, the above definition results in the following 
value for the momentum: 
p = hk¯ = h
2π
2π
λ = h
λ
. (1.25) 
Thus, Eq. (1.24) is consistent with de Broglie’s postulate of a material wave. 
Classically, the kinetic energy is given by p2/(2m). This definition can be used 
to define quantum mechanical kinetic energy operator as 
Kˆ = pˆ2
2m = − h¯
2
2m
∂2
∂x2 (1.26) 
The combination of Eq. (1.23), with V (x) for A(x), and Eq. (1.26) leads to 
a compact expression for the time dependent Schrödinger equation ( 1.20) as 
summarized below. 
Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation and Hamiltonian

(continued)14 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics
The implication of this is that the Hamiltonian operator generates the time 
evolution of the wavefunction. Thus, information on the Hamiltonian and the 
wavefunction at a given timet = t0 allows determination of the quantum state 
at any time. 
1.3.3 Stationary States and Time Independent Schrödinger 
Equation 
Let us define a stationary quantum mechanical state ψs(x, t) as the one satisfying 
the following relationship: 
ih¯
∂
∂t ψs(x, t) = Eψs(x, t). (1.29) 
Let us also assume that the dependences of the wavefunction on position and time 
can be decoupled from each other as follows: ψs(x, t) = ψ(x)f (t). Inserting this 
relation into the above equation, we obtain 
ih¯
df (t)
dt ψ(x) = Ef (t)ψ(x). (1.30) 
For nonzeroψ(x), the above relation implies that 
df (t)
dt = −iE
h¯ f (t), (1.31) 
the solution of which is f (t) = f (0)e−iEt/h¯ . Let us now assume that the time 
independent part of the wavefunction is equal to the full time dependent wave 
function att = 0. That is,ψ(x) = ψs(x, 0). Then,f (0) = 1 and 
f (t) = e−iEt/h¯ . (1.32) 
Inserting ψs(x, t) = f (t)ψ(x), with the above expression for f (t), into Eq. (1.29), 
we obtain 
H ψ(x) ˆ = Eψ(x). (1.33) 
Thus, for a special kind of wavefunction ψ(x) that satisfies the above equation, 
the corresponding time dependent wavefunction that satisfies Schrödinger’s time 
dependent equation, Eq. (1.27), is obtained by simply multiplying it with e−iEt/h¯ .1.3 Schrödinger Equation (in One Dimension) and Probability Amplitude 15
Time Independent Schrödinger Equation and Eigenvalue of Hamiltonian 
Equation (1.33) is known as time independent Schrödinger equation and 
can be used for complete specification of all the stationary states and 
corresponding energies for a given Hamiltonian. Not all wavefunctions and 
energy E satisfy this equation. In fact, this is an eigenvalue problem, for 
which both E and ψ(x) should be determined. Let us denote the wavefunction 
satisfying Eq. (1.33) for a specific value of E as ψE (x). Namely, 
H ψˆ E (x) = EψE (x). (1.34) 
Mathematically, ψE (x) is called an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian operator 
with eigenvalue E. Physically, what this means is that, if the energy is 
measured for a system represented byψE (x), the state is not disturbed and the 
result of the energy measurement is the value of E. For a given Hamiltonian, 
there is a well-defined set of finite or infinite eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, 
the determination of which amounts to fully solving the time independent 
Schrödinger equation. 
1.3.4 Eigenfunction and Eigenvalue 
Eigenfunction and eigenvalue are general mathematical terms that are not necessar￾ily limited to quantum mechanics. For any mathematical operator Oˆ satisfying the 
following condition: 
Oψˆ λ(x) = λψλ(x), (1.35) 
one can call ψλ(x) as an eigenfunction of Oˆ with eigenvalue λ. Solving this 
eigenvalue problem is often the major step for finding a general solution involving 
the operatorOˆ. 
Even within quantum mechanics, eigenfunction and eigenvalue are not limited to 
the Hamiltonian operator but can also be defined for other physical observables. For 
example, considerφk(x) = eikx , where k is a real number. Then, 
pφˆ k(x) = h¯
i
∂
∂x eikx = hke ¯ ikx = hkφ ¯ k(x). (1.36) 
The above relation shows that φk(x) is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator 
with eigenvalue hk¯ . In other words, φk(x) represents a quantum mechanical state 
with a definite momentumhk¯ .16 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics
For a quantum particle moving freely in space without any potential energy, the 
Hamiltonian operator is 
Hˆfp = pˆ2
2m = − h¯
2
2m
∂2
∂x2 . (1.37) 
Then, 
Hˆfpφk(x) = − h¯
2
2m
∂2
∂x2 eikx = h¯
2k2
2m eikx . (1.38) 
This shows thatφk(x) is also an eigenfunction ofHˆfp with eigenvalueh¯
2k2/(2m). 
On the other hand, if there is nonzero potential V (x), φk(x) no longer becomes 
the eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian as shown below. 
H φˆ k(x) =


h¯
2k2
2m + V (x)
φk(x) = λφk(x),for any λ (1.39) 
As the above equation indicates, φk(x) is not an eigenfunction of Hˆ for nonzero 
potential becauseV (x)φk(x) cannot be a constant multiple of φk(x). 
1.3.5 Linear and Hermitian Operator 
For any physically measurable quantity, there should be a well-defined operator for 
which eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be identified. However, it is important to 
note that not all kinds of mathematical operators can be used to represent a physical 
observable. 
First, it is assumed that any operator corresponding to physical observable is 
linear. The definition of a linear operator is as follows. 
Definition of Linear Operator 
An operator acting on a set of complex functions, F, is called linear, if for any 
functions f1(x) and f2(x) belonging toF and complex coefficientsc1 and c2, 
the following identity always holds: 
O(c ˆ 1f1(x) + c2f2(x)) = c1Ofˆ 1(x) + c2Ofˆ 2(x). (1.40) 
The above definition implicitly assumes that any linear combination (with 
complex coefficients) of functions belonging toF still remains inF. It is easy 
to show that the position, momentum, and Hamiltonian operators are all linear 
operators.1.3 Schrödinger Equation (in One Dimension) and Probability Amplitude 17
Second, the eigenvalues of operators corresponding to physical observables have 
to be real-valued because no physical measurement can produce complex numbers. 
A class of operators called Hermitian operators guarantee this property. Therefore, 
all operators corresponding to physical observables are assumed to be Hermitian. 
The definition of a Hermitian operator is as follow. 
Definition of Hermitian Operator 
An operator Aˆ that acts on a complex valued function of one dimensional 
variable x is called Hermitian if it satisfies the following identity for any 
complex valued functionsφ(x) and ψ(x): 
	
R
dx φ∗(x)Aψ(x) ˆ =
	
R
dx ψ∗(x)Aφ(x) ˆ
∗
, (1.41) 
where R represents the domain of x where the functions are defined (including 
its boundary condition) and (···)∗ denote complex conjugate. It is assumed 
that the operator Aˆ acts on the function on its righthand side. 8 The above 
definition can be extended to functions of multi-variables by simply extending 
the integration to corresponding multi-dimensional integration. 
8More generally, it is possible to define an operator acting on the function on the lefthand 
side, for which the definition of a Hermitian operator remains the same. 
It is easy to show that the position operator and any function of position operator 
are Hermitian. The proof that momentum operator is a Hermitian operator can also 
be proved employing integration by parts given that the boundary terms do not 
contribute. The fact that the eigenvalue of a Hermitian operator is a real number 
can be shown easily as follows. 
Theorem 1.1 If φλ(x) is an eigenfunction of a Hermitian operator Aˆ, its eigenvalue 
λ is always a real number. 
Proof By employing ψ(x) = φ(x) = φλ(x) on the lefthand side of Eq. ( 141) and 
using the fact thatAφˆ λ(x) = λφλ(x), we obtain

1.3.6 Results of Measurement and Expectation Value 
When a quantum system is in an eigenstate of a physical observable Aˆ, the result 
of the measurement is always the corresponding eigenvalue. What if the state is not 
any of the eigenstates? Then, the result of the measurement is not certain. However, 
even in this case, a possible value of individual measurement result is always one of 
the known eigenvalues of Aˆ. 
To be more specific, let us assume that the state of the system at a certain time 
is ψ(x) and the eigenstates of Aˆ are φj (x)’s with eigenvalues Aj ’s, where j is an 
index labeling the eigenstates. Then, the statement given above can be represented 
by the following probability for the result of the measurement made for the state 
ψ(x) to be the eigenvalueAj : 
pj (ψ) =




	
R
dx φ∗
j (x)ψ(x)




2
. (1.44) 
In caseψ(x) is φj (x), this probability is equal to one because φj (x) is normalized. 
Thus, the measurement result is always Aj . In case ψ(x) is φk(x) for different 
Ak = Aj , it is logically clear that this probability should be zero. This is possible 
only if 
	
R
dx φ∗
j (x)φk(x) = 0, for Aj = Ak. (1.45) 
This can be proved using the fact that Aˆ is Hermitian as follows. 
Theorem 1.2 Two eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator with different eigenval￾ues are always orthogonal to each other. 
Proof Equation (1.41) for the case ofφj (x) and φk(x) becomes 
	
R
dx φ∗
j (x)Aφˆ k(x) =
	
R
dx φ∗
k (x)Aφˆ j (x)∗
. (1.46) 
Since Aφˆ k(x) = Akφk(x) and Aφˆ j (x) = Ajφj (x), the above relation implies that 
Ak
	
R
dx φ∗
j (x)φk(x) =

Aj
	
R
dx φ∗
k (x)φj (x)∗
. (1.47)1.3 Schrödinger Equation (in One Dimension) and Probability Amplitude 19
Since Aj is a real number and (φ∗
k (x)φj (x))∗ = φk(x)φ∗
j (x), the above identity 
implies that 
(Ak − Aj )
	
R
dx φ∗
j (x)φk(x) = 0. (1.48) 
Since Ak − Aj = 0, the above identity is equivalent to Eq. ( 1.45). 
Let us consider more general case where the wavefunction is given by a linear 
combination of different φk(x)’s for which all the eigenvalues Ak’s are different as 
follows: 
ψ(x) = 
k
Ckφk(x), (1.49) 
where Ck’s are complex coefficients that can be arbitrary except for the constraint 
that 
k |Ck|
2 = 1. The reason for this constraint will soon become clear. 
Employing Eq. (1.44), we find that 
pj (ψ) =

2
= |Cj |
2, (1.50) 
where Theorem 1.2 has been used and δjk is the Kronecker-delta symbol. 9 This 
means that the absolute square of each coefficient in Eq. ( 1.49) corresponds to the 
probability. Therefore, 
k |Ck|
2 = 1 because the sum of all probabilities have to 
become one. 
For the case where some of the eigenvalues Aj ’s are the same, the orthogonality 
given by Theorem 1.2 is not always satisfied. However, even in this case, it is 
always possible to identify orthogonal φk(x)’s with respect to which a unique 
linear combination given by Eq. ( 1.49) can be identified for any wavefunction ψ(x). 
Then, each |Ck|
2 can be interpreted as the probability for the state to exist in the 
state represented by φk(x). Thus, for such a general state, although the results of 
measurement are not always certain, one can expect that the average over many 
repeated measurements, so called expectation value can always be calculated as 
described below. 
Expectation Value 
For a general normalized quantum state given by Eq. ( 1.49) the expectation 
value for the measurement of an operator Aˆ is given by

Alternatively, the expectation value can be expressed as 
Aˆ	 =

The equivalence of Eqs. (1.51) and (1.52) can be proved by using Eq. ( 1.49) 
and employing the orthogonality Theorem 1.2. 
1.4 Quantum Particle in a One-Dimensional Box 
Let us consider a particle with mass m contained in a one-dimensional box of length 
l. That is, the potential V (x) = 0 for 0 <x<l, and V (x) = ∞ for x ≤ 0 or 
x ≥ l. Figure 1.3 illustrates the system and an example of a classical trajectory that 
bounces back and forth between two infinite walls at constant speed. The quantum 
mechanical behavior of this particle is drastically different, as will be shown in this 
section. The Hamiltonian operator within the box and the wavefunction outside the 
box are given by 
Hˆ = pˆ2
2m for 0 < x < l,
ψ(x, t) = 0 for x ≤ 0 or x ≥ l.
Fig. 1.3 One dimensional 
box, where the potential 
energy is zero for0 <x<L
and infinite outside of this 
region. The ordinate 
represents energy. The blue 
circle represents a classical 
particle, and the arrows 
represent the direction of 
their movement at different 
positions within the box1.4 Quantum Particle in a One-Dimensional Box 21
1.4.1 Time Independent Schrödinger Equation 
Let us denote the eigenfunction with energy E as ψE(x). Then, for0 <x<l, 
H ψˆ E(x) = − h¯
2
2m
∂2
∂x2 ψE(x) = EψE(x), (1.53) 
with the following boundary conditions: ψE(0) = ψE(l) = 0. A general solution 
for Eq. (1.53) is given by 
ψE(x) = C1eikx + C2e−ikx . (1.54) 
By plugging this into Eq. ( 1.53), one can show that 
E = h¯
2k2
2m . (1.55) 
However, this does not complete the solution yet because the boundary conditions 
need to be satisfied as well. Imposing the boundary conditions limits the possible 
values of k (therefore E). In other words, the wavefunction should become zero 
when x = 0 and x = l. Thus, 
ψE(0) = C1 + C2 = 0, (1.56) 
from which we get C1 = −C2. Inserting this into Eq. ( 1.54) and imposing that 
ψ(l) = 0, we get 
ψE(l) = C1(eikl − e−ikl) = 2iC1 sin(kl) = 0. (1.57) 
This condition is satisfied for nonzero C1 only if k = nπ/l with n = 1, 2,... . 
Inserting this into Eq. (1.55), we find that the energy is quantized as follows: 
En = π2h¯
2n2
2ml2 , n = 1, 2,... (1.58) 
Up to now, the constant C1 has not been determined yet. Let us introduce a new 
constant C = 2iC1 and label each eigenfunction with the integer quantum number 
n. Then, 
ψn(x) = C sin nπ x
l

. (1.59)22 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics

Assuming that C is real and positive, 10 the above equation shows that C = √2/l. 
Therefore, the nth eigenfunction is given by 
ψn(x) =
2
l
sin nπ x
l

. (1.61) 
One can directly confirm that ψn(x) given above satisfies the time independent 
Schrödinger equation, Eq. (1.53), for the energy given by Eq. ( 1.58). 
It is clear that ψn(x) given by Eq. (1.61) is not an eigenfunction of the position 
or momentum operator. On the other hand, it is an eigenfunction of pˆ2 with an 
eigenvalue h¯
2π2n2/l2. This is because the wavefunction is a combination of equal 
weight of those with positive and negative values of the same magnitude of the 
momentum, hπn/l ¯ . This value of momentum indeed satisfies the de Broglie’s 
relationship given that the wavelength λn = 2l/n of ψn(x) is used. Thus, the de 
Broglie wave is nothing but the Schrödinger’s wavefunction. 
The expectation value of position for ψn(x) can be calculated as

Thus, the average position is the center of the box and is independent of the quantum 
number n. On the other hand, the expectation value of momentum is always zero as 
follows:

wavefunction.

where the last equality holds becauseHˆ is a linear operator. 
Equation (1.71) proves that any linear combination of the eigenstates with 
appropriate time dependent factore−iEnt/h¯ satisfies the time dependent Schrödinger 
equation. Although we have specifically assumed that ψn(x) is the solution of the 
time independent Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a box, Eq. ( 1.71) 
is generally true for any Hamiltonian.

where δnm is the Kronecker-delta symbol introduced in Eq. ( 1.50). The set of 
eigenfunctions form a complete basis in the sense that any well-behaved function 
can be expressed as 
f (x) = ∞

(1.75) 
Because the above relation holds for any function f (x), we come up with the 
following identity: 
∞
m=1
ψm(x)ψ∗
m(x
) = δ(x − x
), (1.76) 
where δ(x − x
) is called Dirac-delta function, a singular “function” that is in fact 
something called a “distribution” mathematically. More detailed description of this 
is provided in Appendix. 
Equation (1.76) is an example of the completeness relationship. Although this 
was demonstrated here for the particular example of the particle in a box, it is in 
fact possible to identify a set of eigenfunctions satisfying such an identity for any 
Hamiltonian. Such eigenfunctions form a complete basis set. 
1.5 Summary and Questions 
The theory of quantum mechanics is based on two principles well established 
through classical mechanics. These are fundamental principles that (i) the energy of 
a closed isolated system remains conserved (the principle of energy conservation), 
and that (ii) any physical processes are manifestations of clear relationships between 
certain causes and effects that are both well defined and quantifiable (the principle 
of causality).26 1 Concepts and Assumptions of Quantum Mechanics
However, the theory of quantum mechanics is a complete departure from that of 
classical mechanics in that simultaneous determination of position and momentum 
of any physical object cannot be made with arbitrary precision. Rather, the precision 
of one or the other has to be given up according to the uncertainty principle, as 
shown by Eq. (1.19) for the case of one dimensional position and momentum. 
Within the formalism of quantum mechanics, the classical notion that position 
and momentum can be determine completely and simultaneously is an approxima￾tion that appears to be valid only when the action, another well-established concept 
in classical mechanics implying “the outcome of applying force for certain time,” is 
much larger than h¯, the reduced Planck constant. This posed serious problem both 
conceptually and practically because it meant that classical Newton’s equation or 
classical Hamiltonian dynamics (a more general form of classical dynamics) can no 
longer be used as rules to describe the dynamics or to understand the relationship of 
causality. 
The notion of the “dual nature of wave and particle,” as first expressed by 
de Broglie for simple cases, Eq. ( 118), and articulated by Bohr, provided new 
conceptual basis for understanding the uncertainty principle and motivated further 
experimental discoveries. Then, the formulations by Schrödinger and Heisenberg 
made it possible to describe states and dynamics of quantum particles while not 
violating the two fundamental principles of energy conservation and causality, as 
stated by (i) and (ii) above. 
The success of Schrödinger equation, Eq. (1.27), and its time independent version 
for stationary states, Eq. (1.34), led to the establishment of the theory of quantum 
mechanics as an ultimate theory for all atomic and molecular properties and 
phenomena. Although there have been and are still fundamental debates about the 
physical meaning of the Schrödinger equation, the fact that actual states of a system 
and physically measured quantities have to be considered separately is now well 
established. 
While the Schrödinger equation appears to provide a full description of a 
quantum mechanical state, what is being described by the equation, namely a 
wavefunction, cannot in fact be measured experimentally. Rather, a wavefunction 
can provide only the probability of certain outcomes of the measurements in 
general. The exception to this is when the state is in an eigenstate of the operator 
corresponding to measurement, which often involves the measurement process itself 
as ways to prepare such states. In this case, the outcome of the measurement is 
certain and it is assumed that the complete information on the state of the system 
can be deduced once we are able to determine the eigenstates of all other compatible 
physical observables. 
Another difficulty of quantum mechanics as a theory lies in the fact that the 
solution of the Schrödinger equation is difficult to get exactly except for very 
simple model systems. As yet, detailed study of such few examples, for which exact 
solutions are available, helps understand clearly major concepts and phenomena 
that are unique for quantum mechanics. These include superposition states as 
linear combinations of other states and important rules concerning definitions and 
interpretations of measurements. A short overview of the problem of quantum 
particle in a one dimensional box, described in Sect. 1.4, serves as a good example.Appendix: Dirac-Delta Function 27

particle falls off the tip if it goes outside of its width. According to the Heisenberg’s 
uncertainty principle, what is the maximum time the particle can stay on top of the 
tip? 
Solution 1.3 For the particle to stay on top of the tip, the uncertainty of position has 
to be equal to or less than 1 mm. According to the Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation, 
Eq. (1.19), this implies that 
p ≥

If the particle stays on top of the tip for t, this means that the magnitude of the 
momentum is approximately given by mx/t. Since p > p, this means that 
t ≈ mx

Dirac Notation and Principles 
of Quantum Mechanics 
The fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment 
of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus 
completely known, . . . . 
— Paul A. M. Dirac 
Abstract This chapter introduces Dirac’s notations for kets and bras, which 
represent quantum states, and the rules for inner and outer products between them. 
Operators are defined as linear combinations of outer products between kets and 
bras. The definition of a Hermitian operator in this Dirac notation and proofs of 
its properties are provided. Based on expressions for position, momentum, and 
Hamiltonian operators, time dependent and time independent Schrödinger equations 
are also provided. After important identities concerning commutators and unitary 
operators are detailed, the results for particle in a box problem are re-expressed in 
the Dirac notation. The chapter concludes with introduction of direct products that 
are used to expand the dimension of the state space. 
2.1 Formulation of Quantum Mechanics 
Schrödinger’s formulation of quantum mechanics, as introduced in Chap. 1, is based 
on the assumption that quantum states can be represented by complex functions 
of position and that all physical observables can be expressed as operators acting 
on the wavefunction through the position variable. Schrödinger’s formulation has 
been essential in obtaining practical solutions of quantum mechanical problems. 
However, because it gives the position a special role, the distinctions between 
position as a variable for describing quantum state, as an operator for position 
measurement, and as an outcome of the measurement, are not always expressed 
clearly. This can sometimes cause confusion and misunderstanding. 
On the other hand, within Heisenberg’s formulation of quantum mechanics, 
which in fact preceded Schrödinger’s formulation by a few months, states and 
operators are represented as vectors and matrices, and position and momentum

operators are treated in more equivalent manner. Another major difference of 
Heisenberg’s formulation is that what changes with time are operators themselves, 
rather than the state of a quantum system as assumed in Schrödinger’s formulation. 
Heisenberg’s formulation makes the role of an operator clear. It is also convenient 
if the eigenstates and eigenvalues are known or can be determined by other means. 
However, dealing with all the matrix and vector elements often can be cumbersome 
if the number of states is large or infinite. 
Although the two formulations by Schrödinger and Heisenberg appear to be 
completely different, they can in fact be related to each other through an appropriate 
transformation from the function space to the vector space. Dirac facilitated 
clarification of this relationship by inventing an elegant set of notations and rules, 
which make such transformations look very natural.1 The efficacy of the Dirac 
notations in exposing the major principles of quantum mechanics has made it the 
most popular framework for describing quantum mechanics. 
This chapter provides a concise description of the Dirac notation and presents the 
principles of quantum mechanics embedded in that notation [5, 6, 8]. The approach 
here is somewhat axiomatic in the sense that abstract mathematical definitions are 
given first without offering clear physical justifications. However, once a reader 
becomes familiar with them, understanding quantum mechanical principles will be 
much more straightforward. 
2.2 Ket, Bra, and Products 
It is important to note that the state of a quantum system in Schrödinger’s 
formulation is represented by the entirety of the wavefunction, not by its particular 
value at certain position as the notation ψ(x) may suggest. Likewise, a quantum 
mechanical operator should be viewed as the entire mapping from one state (the full 
set of values of wavefunction at all positions) to another state. Thus, A(ˆ x)ψ(x) ˆ in 
Schrödinger’s formulation should be viewed as representing the full set of results of 
“multiplying the value of function A(x) with the value of the wavefunction at the 
same position x.” 
A quantum mechanical state, even when represented by Schrödinger’s wavefunc￾tion, can be viewed as a complex-valued vector in Hilbert space [24], with each 
element of this vector representing the value of the wavefunction at specific position. 
Once this notion of a vector in abstract function space is accepted, its components 
can be transformed to different ones involving parameters other than position 
variable through an appropriate transformation. In this sense, one can perceive a 
quantum state as a vector in abstract function space, which exists independent of 
how it is represented. Dirac represented such a vector by a ket or a bra equivalently.
1 Mathematically speaking, Dirac notation can simply be considered as an effective visualization 
tool to introduce a complete and normed (or inner product) complex vector space, so called Hilbert 
space, and mappings defined in the Hilbert space. 2.2 Ket, Bra, and Products 37
Fig. 2.1 A simple illustration of the relationship between a ket |α, its Hermitian adjoin, bra α|, 
and the corresponding norm, α|α, which corresponds to the projection on to the positive side of 
the real axis 
The relationship between a ket and its corresponding bra is like a complex number 
and its conjugate (see Fig. 2.1). More detailed description is provided below. 
Notation and Properties of Ket and Ket Space 
A ket is denoted as |···, where ··· represents the parameters specifying the 
ket, and has the following properties.
• Given two quantum mechanical states respectively represented by |α and 
|β defined in the same vector space, it is possible to construct a different 
ket as their linear combinations as follows: 
|γ  = c1|α + c2|β, (2.1) 
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary complex numbers. This linear combination, 
indeed, represents a different quantum mechanical state as long as |α and 
|β are independent, which means that the two are not related to each other 
by a constant factor.
• Any two kets related by a constant factor is viewed as representing the 
same state. In other words, one of the major assumptions of quantum 
mechanics is that multiplying a ket with a nonzero complex number does 
not alter the physical state. That is, |α and c|α (with c = 0) represent the 
same quantum state.2 For this reason, only the relative value of c1 to c2
does matter in Eq. (2.1).
• A complete set of all the kets that can be constructed through linear 
combinations constitute an abstract vector space called ket space. 
2Multiplication of any ket or bra with zero results in the null ket or bra.38 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
A bra space is a vector space dual to a ket space. Mathematically, these two 
can define an inner product space as will be shown below. Using the terms of 
matrix theory, a ket can be viewed as a column vector of complex numbers, and 
bra as its complex conjugate and transpose, thus a row vector consisting of complex 
conjugates. For every ket |α, there exists a unique bra denoted as α| and vice versa. 
Given a ket defined as a linear combination of different kets, the corresponding bra 
can be obtained according to the following rule. 
Relationship Between Ket and Bra Space 
A state expressed as a linear combination of kets in a ket space is equivalent 
to the same linear combination of bras in the corresponding bra space but with 
complex conjugates of the corresponding coefficients as follows. 
c1|α + c2|β+···⇔ α|c∗
1 + β|c∗
2 +··· . (2.2) 
Between a bra and a ket, two types of products can be defined. One is the inner 
product, and the other is the outer product. The inner product is defined only 
between a ket on the right hand side and a bra on the left hand side. More detailed 
definitions and properties are provided below. 
Definition and Properties of Inner Product 
The inner product between a ket |α and a bra β| results in a complex number, 
and is expressed as 
(β|) · (|α) = β|α, (2.3) 
where · is a temporary symbol used to denote the product. There are three 
important properties involving inner products.
• Two states represented by |α and |β are called orthogonal to each other 
if α|β=β|α = 0.
• The complex conjugate of an inner product is equal to the inner product 
between corresponding ket and bra interchanged as follows: 
β|α=α|β
∗, (2.4) 
where ∗ represents the complex conjugate. As a result, α|α is always real. 
(continued)2.2 Ket, Bra, and Products 39
• The inner product between a ket and bra of the same state is nonnegative. 
Namely, 
α|α ≥ 0. (2.5) 
The equality above holds true only when |α is a null ket that represents 
a non-existent state. The inner product α|α serves as the measure of the 
size of the ket (or bra), and its square root is called norm. A normalized 
state has a unit norm. As an outcome of Eq. (2.5), the magnitude of the 
inner product between two normalized states is always less than or equal 
to one (see Appendix of this chapter). 
The outer product is defined only between a ket on the left hand side and a bra 
on the right hand side, and is used to represent a mapping from a ket (bra) to a bra 
(ket). Its notation and detailed properties are provided below. 
Definition and Properties of Outer Product 
The outer product between a ket |α and a bra β| is defined as 
(|α) · (β|) = |αβ|, (2.6) 
where again · is a temporary symbol used to denote the product. In relation 
to inner products, outer products have two important properties as described 
below.
• The combination of inner and outer products satisfy the following associa￾tive rule: 
(|αβ|) · |γ =|α · (β|γ ) = |αβ|γ . (2.7) 
That is, |αβ| is nothing but an operator that turns an arbitrary state |γ 
into |α multiplied with a complex number β|γ . Similarly, the following 
associative rule always applies: 
(α|β)γ |=α|(|βγ |) = α|βγ |, (2.8) 
which shows that |βγ | is an operator that turns an arbitrary bra state α|
into another bra state γ | multiplied with a complex number α|β. 
(continued)40 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
• Both inner and outer products satisfy distributive rules as follows. 
α|(C1|β + C2|γ ) = C1α|β + C2α|γ , (2.9) 
(C1|β + C2|γ )α| = C1|βα| + C2|γ α|. (2.10) 
2.3 Operators 
An operator acts on a ket (bra) and produces another ket (bra). It can always be 
represented as a linear combination of outer products of kets and bras. Like the 
relationship between ket and bra, for a given operator Oˆ, there is an equivalent form 
of the same operator that “mirrors” the action in ket space to the one in bra space, 
and vice versa as describe below. 
Hermitian Conjugate of an Operator 
Given an operator Oˆ, its Hermitian conjugate Oˆ † satisfies the following dual 
correspondence rule for an arbitrary ket |α: 
Oˆ|α⇔α|Oˆ †. (2.11) 
Therefore, if Oˆ = c1|α1β1| + c2|α2β2|+··· , 
Oˆ † = c∗
1|β1α1| + c∗
2|β2α2|+··· . (2.12) 
For arbitrary |α and |β, one can show that 
α|Oˆ †|β = 
β|Oˆ|α
∗
. (2.13) 
For a given operator Oˆ, its eigenket3 is defined as the ket satisfying the following 
relationship: 
Oˆ|u = λu|u, (2.14) 
where λu is the eigenvalue of the operator Oˆ corresponding to the eigenket |u
and is a complex number in general. According to the definition of the Hermitian
3 The state represented by this eigenket is called eigenstate. 2.3 Operators 41
conjugate, Eq. (2.14) implies that 
u|Oˆ † = u|λ∗
u = λ∗
uu|, (2.15) 
where λ∗
u is the complex conjugate of λu. 
The operator that does not alter any ket or bra is called the identity operator, and 
is denoted as 1ˆ. That is, any ket or bra is an eigenket or eigenbra of the identity 
operator with its eigenvalue as one. 
2.3.1 Hermitian Operator 
Definition of Hermitian Operator 
An operator Aˆ is Hermitian if it is identical to its own Hermitian conjugate 
as follows: 
Aˆ = Aˆ†. (2.16) 
Therefore, inserting the above identity into Eq. (2.13), one can show that the 
Hermitian operator Aˆ satisfies the following identity: 
α|Aˆ|β=β|Aˆ|α
∗, (2.17) 
where |α and |β are arbitrary states. 
The definition of Hermitian operators given above makes it straightforward to prove 
two theorems proven in Chap. 1 for operators being applied to wavefunctions in one￾dimensional space. Namely, the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are always real 
numbers, and two eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are 
always orthogonal. Full statements and proofs of these theorems are provided below. 
Theorem 2.1 Given a Hermitian operator Aˆ, all of its eigenvalues are real 
numbers. 
Proof Given that |a is an eigenstate of Aˆ with finite norm and eigenvalue λa, the 
use of |α=|β=|a in Eq. (2.17) leads to the following identity: 
λaa|a=a|Aˆ|a=a|Aˆ|a
∗ = λ∗
aa|a. (2.18) 
Since a|a is real and is assumed to be nonzero, this identity leads to λa = λ∗
a, 
which is true only when λa is a real number. 	42 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
Theorem 2.2 The eigenkets of a Hermitian operator Aˆ corresponding to different 
eigenvalues are always orthogonal. 
Proof Let us assume that |a

 and |a

 are eigenkets of Aˆ with two different 
eigenvalues, λa
 and λa

 . Then, 
a

|Aˆ|a

 = λa
a

|a

 = λa

a

|a

, (2.19) 
where the first equality results from applying Aˆ to a

| and the second equality 
results from applying Aˆ to |a

. Since λa
 = λa

 , the only possibility that the above 
equality is true is that a

|a

 = 0. This proves the above statement regarding the 
orthogonality. 	
All physical observables correspond to Hermitian operators. If not, one has 
to accept that complex values can result from the measurement of the physical 
observable, which is impossible because all the values we deal with are real 
numbers. Well known examples of physical observables are position and momentum 
operators, which will be described in more detail in the next subsection. Most 
importantly, a Hamiltonian operator is Hermitian. 
2.3.2 One Dimensional Position Operator and Eigenket 
Let us consider a one dimensional position operator xˆ. Then, one can define a 
position eigenket |x such that 
xˆ|x = x|x=|xx. (2.20) 
Similarly, the action of the position operator on x| is defined by 
x| ˆx = x|x = xx|. (2.21) 
Then, the Schrödinger’s wavefunction, or its value at particular position x, can be 
defined as an inner product of a state ket with the position bra , x|. For example, 
consider a state |α. Then, the corresponding wavefunction can be defined as 
ψα(x) = x|α. (2.22) 
Taking the complex conjugate of this, 
ψ∗
α(x) = α|x. (2.23)2.3 Operators 43
Combining the above definitions, one can find out the effect of the operation of xˆ on 
an arbitrary state |α as follows: 
x| ˆx|α = (x| ˆx)|α = xx|α. (2.24) 
The set of position eigenkets is always complete as follows: 
1ˆ =
 ∞
−∞
dx|xx|. (2.25) 
This means that the values of wavefunction at all positions provide complete 
information on the state. This becomes clear by applying the above identity to an 
arbitrary state as follows: 
|α = 1ˆ|α =  ∞
−∞
dx |xx|α =  ∞
−∞
dx |xψα(x) =
 ∞
−∞
dx ψα(x)|x.
(2.26) 
Note that the last equality in the above equation results from ψα(x) being a complex 
number and that its order with respect to the ket does not matter. The above identity 
implies that the value of a Schrödinger’s wavefunction at each x can be viewed 
as nothing but the coefficient (with the inclusion of integration element dx) in the 
expansion of the state |α in terms of the position eigenkets. This also ensures that 
the normalization condition within the Dirac notation is the same as that involving 
Schrödinger’s wavefunction as follows: 
α|α=α|1ˆ|α =  ∞
−∞
dx α|xx|α =  ∞
−∞
dx |ψα(x)|
2. (2.27) 
Applying Eq. (2.25) to another position ket, we also find that 
|x

 =  ∞
−∞
dx |xx|x

. (2.28) 
Since the above equation must be true for any value of x

, this means that 
x|x

 = δ(x − x

), (2.29) 
where δ(x −x

) is the Dirac-delta function defined in Chap. 1, and is zero for x = x

and ∞ for x = x
 while its integration is equal to one. Note that this Dirac-delta 
function is not a genuine function, but can be defined only as a limiting value of a 
sequence of functions that attain the stated properties. Thus, care should be taken 
working with the delta function.44 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
2.3.3 One Dimensional Momentum Operator and Eigenket 
It was stated in Chap. 1 that measurement of momentum corresponds to taking the 
first order derivative of the wavefunction, as shown by Eq. (1.24). Let us assume that 
φp(x) is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator with eigenvalue p. According 
to Schrödinger’s formulation, this should satisfy 
h¯
i
∂
∂x φp(x) = pφp(x). (2.30) 
A general solution of the above equation is 
φp(x) = Npeipx/h¯ . (2.31) 
where Np is a normalization constant. In the Dirac notation, the above eigenfunction 
of momentum operator can be viewed as the inner product between momentum 
eigenket and position eigenbra as follows: 
φp(x) = x|p, (2.32) 
where |p is an eigenstate of the momentum operator satisfying 
pˆ|p = p|p. (2.33) 
As is the case of position ket and bra, the momentum ket and bra are assumed to 
satisfy the following completeness relation: 
1ˆ =
 ∞
−∞
dp |pp|. (2.34) 
Then, the normalization constant Np can be determined in the following way: 
δ(x − x

) = x|x

=x|1ˆ|x

 =  ∞

dpx|pp|x

)/h¯ = N2

)
. (2.35) 
This is consistent with the definition of the Dirac-delta function shown in Eq. (1.85) 
if N2
p = 1/(2πh)¯ . Therefore, 
φp(x) = x|p =
1
√2πh¯
eipx/h¯ . (2.36) 
This identity can be used to find out the effect of the operation of pˆ on the position 
eigenket.2.3 Operators 45
2.3.4 Expressions for Momentum Operator 
One can show that 
x| ˆp|p=x|p|p = px|p =
h¯
i
∂
∂x x|p. (2.37) 
Taking complex conjugate of the above equation and noting that pˆ is a Hermitian 
operator, one can find that 
p| ˆp|x=−

Note that the sign on the righthand side of Eq. (2.39) is opposite to that for the 
Schrödinger’s definition of momentum measurement given by Eq. (1.24). In fact, 
the two is consistent with each other and can be shown to be equivalent if we use 
a proper version of the Schrödinger’s definition for a momentum operation in the 
Dirac notation as described below. 
Taking the Hermitian conjugate of Eq. (2.39) leads to 
x| ˆp = h¯
i
∂
∂x x|. (2.41) 
Now taking the inner product of the above identity with an arbitrary state |ψα, one 
can obtain 
x| ˆp|ψα =
h¯
i
∂
∂x x|ψα =
h¯
i
∂
∂x ψα(x). (2.42) 
The above identity is equivalent to Eq. (1.24) if we interpret the left hand side as 
an application of the momentum operation on a Schrödinger’s wavefunction. Note 
that pψˆ α(x) does not make sense in the Dirac notation because an operator can be 
applied only to either a ket or bra, not to a complex number.46 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
2.3.5 Schrödinger Equations in the Dirac Notation 
Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation 
The time dependent Schrödinger equation for |ψ;t, a ket representing 
a quantum mechanical state labeled as ψ and dependent on time t as a 
parameter, is as follows: 
ih¯
∂
∂t |ψ;t = Hˆ |ψ;t. (2.43) 
Taking the Hermitian conjugate of the above equation and noting that 
Hamiltonian operator is Hermitian, the above equation for a ket is equivalent 
to an equation for the following equation for the corresponding bra. 
− ih¯
∂
∂t ψ;t|=ψ;t|H. ˆ (2.44) 
On the other hand, for the case of a stationary state, namely, |ψ;t=|ψe−iEt/h¯ , 
the time independent part of this state satisfies the time independent Schrödinger 
equation as described below. 
Time Independent Schrödinger Equation 
The time independent Schrödinger equation for a stationary eigenket |ψ of a 
Hamiltonian Hˆ with eigenvalue E is 
Hˆ |ψ = E|ψ. (2.45) 
The above equation for an eigenket is equivalent to the following equation for 
the corresponding bra. 
ψ|Hˆ = Eψ|. (2.46) 
For a particle with mass m in one dimension subject to a potential energy V (x), 
the Hamiltonian operator is defined 
Hˆ = pˆ2
2m + V (ˆ x). ˆ (2.47)2.3 Operators 47
Note that the above expression is the same as the first form in Eq. (1.28). However, 
note that the second form in this equation has its meaning only when projected to 
the position state. In the Dirac notation, this is realized by taking the inner product 
of the Schrödinger equation with the position state. For example, taking the inner 
product of Eq. (2.45) with x|, we find that 
x|Hˆ |ψ=x|

where we have used the identity of Eq. (2.41) twice in obtaining the second equality 
and used the definition of ψ(x) = x|ψ in the last line. Note that the last line has 
the same form as the original Schrödinger equation. 
2.3.6 Commutator 
Given two operators Aˆ and Bˆ, there are two ways to order them in creating product 
operations. The difference between them is called a commutator, which plays an 
important role in quantum mechanics and is defined as follows. 
[A,ˆ Bˆ] = AˆBˆ − BˆA.ˆ (2.49) 
When the two operators can be measured simultaneously, the above commutator 
is zero. A good example for two commuting operators is the position operator and 
any of its function. Namely, for any operator A(ˆ x)ˆ defined as a function of position 
operator only, [ ˆx, A(ˆ x)ˆ ] = 0. 
If the commutator between two physical observables Aˆ and Bˆ is nonzero, it is 
impossible to measure them simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Rather, the 
product of uncertainties of the two observables has lower bound given by half the 
absolute value of the expectation value of the commutator. Appendix of this chapter 
provides a detailed derivation of this a general uncertainty relationship. 
Expressing an operator as a sum of outer products in the Dirac notation makes 
it straightforward to calculate the commutator. For example, consider two operators 
|αβ| and |γ δ|. The commutator between the two is given by 
[|αβ|, |γ δ|] = |αβ|γ δ|−|γ δ|αβ|
= (β|γ )|αδ| − (δ|α)|γ β|. (2.50)48 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
It is easy to see that this commutator is zero (i) if |α=|γ  and β|=δ|, or (ii) 
β|γ =δ|α = 0. 
The commutator with the most fundamental importance in quantum mechanics 
is that between position and momentum, which is calculated below. 
Commutator Between Position and Momentum Operator 
Let us first apply [ ˆx, pˆ] to an arbitrary ket |α. Taking the inner product of the 
resulting ket with x| leads to 
x|[ ˆx, pˆ]|α=x|(xˆpˆ − ˆpx)ˆ |α

Since the above identity holds true for arbitrary x| and |α, it implies the 
following identity: 
[ ˆx, pˆ] = ih.
¯ (2.52) 
There are a few important rules that commutators satisfy. From the definition of 
the commutator, it is straightforward to show the following identities: 
[aA,ˆ Bˆ]=[A, a ˆ Bˆ] = a[A,ˆ Bˆ], (2.53) 
[A,ˆ Bˆ] = −[B,ˆ Aˆ], (2.54) 
[Aˆ + B,ˆ Cˆ]=[A,ˆ Cˆ]+[B,ˆ Cˆ], (2.55) 
[A,ˆ Bˆ + Cˆ]=[A,ˆ Bˆ]+[A,ˆ Cˆ], (2.56) 
where Aˆ, Bˆ, and Cˆ are arbitrary operators, and a is an arbitrary complex number. 
There is also an important identity involving products between three operators as 
shown below. 
Theorem 2.3 For any operator Aˆ, Bˆ, and Cˆ, the following identity is always true. 
[AˆB,ˆ Cˆ] = Aˆ[B,ˆ Cˆ]+[A,ˆ Cˆ]B. ˆ (2.57)2.3 Operators 49
Proof Employing the definition of a commutator given by Eq. (2.49), the lefthand 
side of the above equation can be expressed as 
[AˆB,ˆ Cˆ] = AˆBˆCˆ − AˆCˆBˆ + AˆCˆBˆ − Cˆ AˆBˆ
= A(ˆ BˆCˆ − CˆB)ˆ + (AˆCˆ − Cˆ A)ˆ Bˆ
= Aˆ[B,ˆ Cˆ]+[A,ˆ Cˆ]B. ˆ (2.58) 
	
In a similar manner, one can also prove the following identity: 
[A,ˆ BˆCˆ] = Bˆ[A,ˆ Cˆ]+[A,ˆ Bˆ]C. ˆ (2.59) 
Finally, it is also easy to prove the following Jacobi identity by directly expanding 
expressions for commutators: 
[A,ˆ [B,ˆ Cˆ]] + [B,ˆ [C,ˆ Aˆ]] + [C,ˆ [A,ˆ Bˆ]] = 0. (2.60) 
2.3.7 Compatibility and Completeness 
Two operators Aˆ and Bˆ are called compatible when their commutator [A,ˆ Bˆ] = 0. If 
two operators are compatible, one can always find the set of simultaneous eigenkets 
of Aˆ and Bˆ. A set of operators is called maximally compatible if all the operators 
in this set are compatible and if there is no additional observable that are compatible 
with all the operators within the set. 
A basis is a set of linearly independent kets (or equivalently a set of linearly 
independent bras). The basis is called orthonormal if all the kets in the set have the 
unit norm and are orthogonal to other kets in the set. A basis set consisting of |n’s 
is called complete if it satisfies the following identity: 
	
n
|nn| = 1ˆ, (2.61) 
where n represents the collection of all parameters need to specify each ket. The 
sum has to become integration if n is a continuous real parameter as in the cases 
of position or momentum. The set of simultaneous eigenkets of maximally com￾patible observables is orthonormal and complete. The number of such eigenkets is 
called the dimension of the ket or bra space.50 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
Let us assume that a set of states |n’s forms a complete orthonormal basis in the 
sense that Eq. (2.61) holds true and that n|n

 = δnn
 . Then, for a given state |α, 
|α = 1ˆ|α = 	
n
|nn|α = 	
n
αn|n, (2.62) 
where αn = n|α. Both associative and distributive rules for inner and outer 
products have been used in deriving the above equality. Similarly, 
α|=α|1ˆ = 	
n
α|nn| = 	
n
α∗
nn|. (2.63) 
Taking the inner product between α| and |α shown above, 
α|α = 	
n
	
m
α|nn|mm|α
= 	
n
	
m
α|nδnmm|α = 	
n
|αn|
2. (2.64) 
If |α is normalized, the above relation implies that 

n |αn|
2 = 1. 
Given a complete orthonormal basis, it is easy to find an expression for any 
operator Aˆ in terms of linear combinations of those involving outer products 
between states within the basis. This expression can be found by applying Eq. (2.61) 
on both sides of Aˆ as follows: 
Aˆ = 1ˆAˆ1ˆ =

|nAnmm| =

Anm|nm|, (2.65) 
where Anm = n|Aˆ|m. For the special case where |n’s are eigenstates of Aˆ, the 
above expression reduces to Aˆ = 

n An|nn|. 
2.3.8 Measurement Operator 
Measurement in quantum mechanics is in general a complicated process through 
which an experimental device interacts with a quantum system and produces real 
numbers as its record [25]. How to understand and define measurement process has 
remained an important foundational issue of quantum mechanics. Although debates 
on quantum measurement still continue, it has been shown that it is possible to 
formulate measurement in a manner fully consistent with the theory of quantum 
mechanics [26–28] unlike the old Copenhagen interpretation that required ad hoc2.3 Operators 51
interaction with classical systems. In addition, there is good consensus that a large 
class of measurements, at least theoretically, can be represented by well-defined 
operators.4 
The simplest operator representing measurement process is called projective 
measurement. Consider a quantum state |ψ and a physical observable Aˆ. Assume 
that a measurement of Aˆ has produced a real number. If the same measurement of Aˆ
is made immediately afterwards, the same number has to be produced according to 
the principle of causality. Therefore, the state right after the measurement of Aˆ has 
to be an eigenstate of Aˆ and the outcome of the measurement has to be an eigenvalue 
of Aˆ. Let us denote this eigenvalue as λa and assume that we can identify a single 
normalized eigenstate |λa corresponding to the state right after the measurement. 
Then, the following projection operator can be used to represent the measurement 
operation: 
Pˆ
λa = |λaλa|. (2.66) 
Thus, the process of measuring λa for a given state |ψ amounts to Pˆ
λa |ψ =
|λaλa|ψ, and the probability of having this outcome is given by |λa|ψ|2. 
More generally, let us assume that it is possible to identify all observables 
compatible with Aˆ. Then, denoting the set of all eigenvalues for the operators as ξ , 
we can identify eigenstates, |λa, ξ ’s, which are orthonormal and complete. Thus, 
1ˆ = 	
λa ,ξ
|λa, ξ λa, ξ |. (2.67) 
Then, the least intrusive projective measurement of λa is represented by 
Pˆ
λa = 	
ξ
|λa, ξ λa, ξ |. (2.68) 
The outcome of this measurement is a linear combination of states with different 
values of ξ , 
Pˆ
λa |ψ = 	
ξ
|λa, ξ λa, ξ |ψ. (2.69) 
The general projective measurement described above can be extended further 
to a so called positive operator valued measure (POVM) measurement, which is
4 This does not yet mean that the issue of quantum measurement is fully settled because there is 
still large gap between theoretical definition and experimental practice of quantum measurement. 
It is often the case that reliable experimental realization of fully quantum mechanical measurement 
is extremely difficult, whereas reliable theoretical modeling of experimentally viable measurement 
can be challenging. 52 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
defined as a nonnegative Hermitian operator ˆ a. The subscript a in this operator 
collectively represents a set of parameters defining the outcome of the measurement, 
and integration (or summation) of all the operators over all possible values of a leads 
to the identity operator as follows: 
1ˆ =

da ˆ a. (2.70) 
It is assumed that different ˆ a’s do not necessarily commute with each other. 
The only requirement is that ˆ a is Hermitian and is positive, which means that 
ψ|ˆ a|ψ ≥ 0 for any |ψ. The POVM measurement is more general than 
projective measurement and can account for physical situations where the details 
of post-measurement states are not completely specified [25]. 
2.3.9 Unitary Operator 
Definition of Unitary Operator 
A unitary operator, denoted as Uˆ here, satisfies the following condition: 
Uˆ †Uˆ = Uˆ Uˆ † = 1ˆ. (2.71) 
In other words, the Hermitian conjugate of a unitary operator corresponds to 
its inverse operator. This property allows the operator to preserve the norm of 
any quantum state and also the orthogonality between two states. 
Unitary operators are essential components in the formulation of quantum mechan￾ics. Let us consider an arbitrary ket |α, which is not necessarily normalized. Then, 
let us introduce another ket created by applying a unitary operator to this as follows: 
|α

 = Uˆ |α. (2.72) 
Note that the above equation does not correspond to any measurement process 
because Uˆ is not Hermitian except for the trivial case of the identity operator. Rather, 
this can simply be viewed as either transformation needed for better representation 
of quantum states or transition that happens naturally. 
The main reason why unitary operators are important is because they conserve 
the norm and the orthogonality between states. In other words, while the new2.3 Operators 53
transformed state |α

 is different from |α in general, the two have the same norm 
as follows: 
α

|α

 = 
α|Uˆ †
 Uˆ |α

= α|

Uˆ †Uˆ

|α=α|1ˆ|α=α|α. (2.73) 
When two orthogonal states are transformed by the same unitary operator, they 
remain orthogonal as well. Let us consider another ket |β and its unitary trans￾formation as follows: 
|β

 = Uˆ |β. (2.74) 
Then, it is also straightforward to show that the inner product between |β

 and |α


remains the same as that between |α and |β as follows: 
β

|α

 = 
β|Uˆ †
 Uˆ |α

= β|

Uˆ †Uˆ

|α=β|1ˆ|α=β|α. (2.75) 
Thus, for the case where β|α = 0, the above identity implies that β

|α

 = 0. 
An important application of a unitary operator is a transformation from one basis 
to another. Consider a set of orthonormal states, |ϕn’s with n = 1, 2, ··· , satisfying 
the following completeness relationship: 
1ˆ = 	∞
n=1
|ϕnϕn|. (2.76) 
Thus, these form a complete orthonormal basis. Then, the following set of states 
created by a unitary transformation, 
|ϕ

n = Uˆ |ϕn, n = 1, 2, 3, ··· (2.77) 
remain orthonormal due to Eqs. (2.73) and (2.75). The fact that these satisfy the 
completeness relationship can also be shown easily. Let us apply Uˆ on the lefthand 
side and Uˆ † on the righthand side of Eq. (2.76). Then, 
1ˆ = Uˆ

	∞

Uˆ † = 	∞

Uˆ |ϕnϕn|Uˆ † = 	∞
n=1
|ϕ

nϕ

n|, (2.78) 
where the first equality results from the definition of the unitary operator, Eq. (2.71). 
The above identity indeed proves that |ϕ

n’s form a complete orthonormal basis.54 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics

identity remains true whether x is a number or an operator. In a similar manner, it is 
possible to prove that Uˆ †
AUˆA = 1ˆ. Therefore, UˆA is a unitary operator. 
A well-known example of the type of the unitary operator given above is the time 
evolution operator defined below.

If we known the complete set of the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the 
Hamiltonian operator, namely, |φn’s and En’s with n = 1, 2, 3, ··· such that 
Hˆ |φn = En|φn, the above time evolution operator can also be expressed as 
UˆH (t) =

expressed as 
|ψ;t = UˆH (t)|ψ. (2.85) 
The above state satisfies the time dependent Schrödinger equation as a result of 
Eq. (2.84).

These eigenstates form a complete orthonormal basis and can be used to represent

2.5 Direct Product 
The direct product is different from the inner or outer product in that it is not an 
operation involving ket (bra) and bra (ket), but rather represents an expansion of the 
vector space or its dimensionality.6 A direct product can be defined between any two
6 Note that the dimensionality of the vector space is different from that of the space, and can often 
be infinite. 2.5 Direct Product 57
independent ket (bra) spaces, each with any dimension, resulting in a combined ket 
(bra) space with higher dimension. For example, if a ket |α is defined in a ket space 
A with dimension N and another ket |β is defined in a ket space B with dimension 
M, one can define the following ket 
|α, β≡|α⊗|β=|α|β, (2.92) 
which is defined in the direct product space A⊗B of dimension M ×N. The second 
equality in the above expression is often used as an abbreviation for the first form 
and should not be confused with incorrect notation for inner or outer product. 
A good example of the direct product is the three dimensional position state. 
For a three-dimensional position vector expressed in Cartesian coordinate system as 
r = xex + yey + zez, one can define the corresponding position state employing 
direct product as follows: 
|r≡|x⊗|y⊗|z=|x|y|z. (2.93) 
This is an eigenstate of the position operator rˆ = ˆxex + ˆyey + ˆzez as follows: 
rˆ|r = r|r. (2.94) 
Similarly, for a three dimensional momentum vector defined in Cartesian coordinate 
system as p = px ex +py ey +pzez, one can define the three dimensional momentum 
state employing the direct product as follows: 
|p≡|px ⊗|py ⊗|pz=|px |py |pz. (2.95) 
This is an eigenstate of the momentum operator pˆ = ˆpx ex + ˆpy ey + ˆpzez as follows: 
pˆ|p = p|p. (2.96) 
The direct product can be used to define a state for many particle systems. For 
example, one can define the position and momentum kets of two particles: 
|r1, r2≡|r1⊗|r2=|r1|r2, (2.97) 
|p1, p2≡|p1⊗|p2=|p1|p2. (2.98) 
For a system with N particles, one can construct position and momentum vector 
states by expanding the above direct products. It is assumed that the sets of 3N
dimensional position or momentum vector states constructed this way can be used 
to completely specify the quantum state of the N particle system.58 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
2.6 Summary and Questions 
The Dirac notation provides an efficient and general way to represent states and 
rules of quantum mechanics. In this notation, Schrödinger’s formulation of quantum 
mechanics employing wavefunction and differential operators can be viewed as a 
position representation of quantum mechanics. 
In the Dirac notation, a quantum state is represented by either ket |··· or bra 
· · · |, where ··· can be any index or symbol employed to label the state. Any 
complex-valued linear combination of kets (bras) belonging to the same ket (bra) 
space becomes a ket (bra) in the same ket (bra) space, which in general represents a 
different quantum state. An inner product can always be defined between a bra and 
a ket defined in these equivalent bra and ket spaces, as in Eq. (2.3), and is a complex 
number in general. 
If the ket and bra represent the same state, the inner product becomes a 
nonnegative real number and is considered as the magnitude of the state. Quantum 
mechanically, this magnitude does not have any physical significance. Thus, any 
ket or bra normalized to have unit magnitude is a convenient choice to carry all the 
necessary quantum mechanical information. 
The inner product between normalized ket and bra can be viewed as indicating 
the dependence on each other, and its absolute value is always smaller than one if 
they represent two different states. If the inner product becomes zero, the two state 
is called orthogonal. Orthonormal states are orthogonal and normalized states, and 
serve as convenient choice to span either the ket or bra space. If a set of orthonormal 
states can be used to represent any state as a linear combination, it is called a 
complete orthonormal basis. 
Outer products can also be defined between any ket in a ket space and another bra 
in the equivalent bra space, as in Eq. (2.6), and can be used to represent an operator 
or a mapping that transforms a ket (bra) to another ket (bra) in the same ket (bra) 
space. 
Given an operator, its Hermitian conjugate is defined by Eq. (2.11). An operator 
is called Hermitian if it is the same as its Hermitian conjugate. Eigenvalues of 
a Hermitian operator are always real and can be used to represent all physical 
observables including the Hamiltonian. Two operators are called compatible if 
the commutator between the two, as defined in Eq. (2.49), is zero. The position 
and momentum operators are not compatible since their commutator is nonzero as 
shown by Eq. (2.52). Eigenstates of maximally compatible physical observables can 
be used to form a complete orthonormal basis. The measurement operator can be 
defined as an outer product of a state with itself, sum of such outer products, or sum 
of positive Hermitian operators. 
The Hermitian conjugate of a unitary operator is its inverse and satisfies the 
relationship of Eq. (2.71). The inner product between a ket and a bra remains the 
same even after they are transformed by a unitary operator. All time evolution 
operators, which satisfy the time dependent Schrödinger equation, are unitary.Appendix: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality and a General Uncertainty Relationship 59
Direct product can be formed between any kets (bras) from different and 
independent ket (bra) spaces, and are used to expand the ket (bra) space. The new 
space formed this way is called direct product space. Operators in this direct product 
space are defined as outer products of corresponding kets and bras in the direct 
product space. 
Questions
• How is a ket or bra space defined?
• Is the inner product between a ket and its corresponding bra always 
nonnegative?
• Can any linear combination of outer products of kets and bras in the Dirac 
notation represent a physical observable?
• How is an eigenket or eigenbra defined for a given operator?
• Why is Hermitian operator important in quantum mechanics?
• When do two operators become compatible with each other?
• How can the identity operator be expressed in terms of complete orthonor￾mal basis states?
• What is the major difference between projective measurement and POVM 
measurement?
• How is time evolution operator defined for a given time independent 
Hamiltonian operator?
• When can a direct product space be formed?
• How can an operator defined in a given ket and bra space be extended to a 
new direct product space? 
Appendix: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality and a General 
Uncertainty Relationship 
The fact that a ket or bra space forms a well defined normed vector space means that 
the inner product between any two states satisfies the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. 
The statement of this inequality and its proof [6] are summarized below. 
Theorem 2.4 Cauchy-Schwartz inequality: For any states |α and |β, which have 
nonzero norms, the following inequality always holds: 
|α|β|2 ≤ α|αβ|β (2.99) 
Proof Consider the following linear combination of |α and |β: 
|γ =|α + C|β. (2.100)60 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
Then, since the inner product of any ket with its corresponding bra is always 
nonnegative, 
γ |γ  = (α| + C∗β|)(|α + C|β)
= α|α + C∗β|α + Cα|β+|C|
2β|β ≥ 0. (2.101) 
Let us choose 
C = −β|α
β|β
. (2.102) 
Employing the above expression in Eq. (2.101), we find that 
α|α − α|β
β|β
β|α − β|α
β|β
α|β + |α|β|2
β|β2 β|β = α|αβ|β − |α|β|2
β|β ≥ 0.
(2.103) 
Since β|β > 0, the above inequality implies that 
α|αβ|β − |α|β|2 ≥ 0, (2.104) 
which completes the proof. 	
For the case where |α and |β are normalized, the above theorem shows that the 
magnitude of the inner product between the two cannot be greater than 1. 
The above Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can be used to prove general uncertainty 
relationship between two non-commuting operators Aˆ and Bˆ as stated below [6]. 
Theorem 2.5 For two Hermitian operators Aˆ and Bˆ and for any state |ψ, the 
following inequality holds.

where Aˆ = Aˆ − ψ|Aˆ|ψ and Bˆ = Bˆ − ψ|Bˆ|ψ.

Cauchy-Schwarz inequality proven above, 
ψ|Aˆ2|ψψ|Bˆ 2|ψ=α|αβ|β ≥ |α|β|2. (2.106)

that

which indicates that this is a real number. Since the square of the absolute value of 
a complex number is equal to the sum of those for real and imaginary parts,

. (2.110) 
Combining the above inequality with Eqs. (2.106) and (2.107), we find that the 
general uncertainty relationship of Eq. (2.105) is always satisfied. This completes 
the proof. 	
For the two physical observables Aˆ and Bˆ and the given state |ψ, let us define 
uncertainties of the two physical observables as A =

ψ|Aˆ2|ψ and B = 
ψ|Bˆ 2|ψ. Then, Eq. (2.105) implies that

which is the general uncertainty relationship that holds between any two non￾commuting physical observables. For the case where Aˆ = ˆx and Bˆ = ˆp, namely 
position and momentum operators, [ ˆx, pˆ] = ih¯. Therefore, xp ≥ h/¯ 2, which is 
a precise statement of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. 
Exercise Problems with Solutions 
2.1 Two states |α and |β are normalized and orthogonal to each other. Given the 
two states |a and |b defined as follows: 
|a=|α + 3i|β,
|b = 2i|α−|β,
calculate a|a, b|b, a|b, and b|a, which are all real or complex numbers.62 2 Dirac Notation and Principles of Quantum Mechanics
Solution 2.1 The four inner products can be calculated using the fact that α|α =
β|β = 1 and α|β=β|α = 0 as follows: 
a|a = (α − 3iβ|) (|α + 3i|β)
= 1 + 9 = 10,
b|b = (−2iα|−β|) (2i|α−|β)
= 4 + 1 = 5,
a|b = (α − 3iβ|) (2i|α−|β)
= 2i + 3i = 5i,
b|a = (−2iα|−β|) (|α + 3i|β)
= −2i − 3i = −5i.
2.2 Two states |α and |β are normalized and orthogonal to each other. A state |1
is given by the following linear combination. 
|1 =
1
√2
(|α+|β).
Show that the above state is normalized. Find another state |2 given by a different 
linear combination of |α and |β, which is orthogonal to |1 and is normalized. 
Solution 2.2 First, let us prove that |1 is normalized. Taking inner product of this 
with itself, we find that 
1|1 =
1
2 (α|+β|) (|α+|β)
= = 1
2
(1 + 1) = 1.
Second, let us assume a state |2 = Cα|α+Cβ|β. For this state to be orthogonal 
to |1,

For the above condition to be satisfied, Cβ = −Cα. Since |2 has to be normalized, 
1 = 2|2=|Cα|
2 + |Cβ|
2 = 2|Cα|
2.Exercise Problems with Solutions 63
The above condition can be satisfied by choosing Cα = 1/
√2. Note that this can 
be multiplied by any unit normal complex value but let us make the simplest choice 
that Cα is real and positive as assumed. Then, Cβ = −1/
√2. As a result, the state 
|2 is given by 
|2 =
1
√2
(|α−|β).
2.3 Two states |α and |β are normalized and orthogonal to each other, in terms of 
which two operators Aˆ and Bˆ are defined as follows: 
Aˆ = |αα|−|ββ|
Bˆ = −i|αβ| + i|βα|
Then, express the following two operators, AˆBˆ + BˆAˆ and iAˆBˆ − iBˆAˆ in terms of 
linear combinations of outer products, |αα|, |ββ|, |αβ|, and |βα|. Make sure 
that you have the simplest possible forms. State whether each of the two operators 
is Hermitian or not, and justify your answers. 
Solution 2.3 The products AˆBˆ and BˆAˆ can be calculated as follows: 
AˆBˆ = (|αα|−|ββ|) (−i|αβ| + i|βα|)
= −i|αβ| − i|βα|,
BˆAˆ = (−|αβ|+|βα|) (|αα| − i|ββ|)
= i|αβ| + i|βα|,
Summing the above two operators, 
AˆBˆ + BˆAˆ = 0,
iAˆBˆ − iBˆAˆ = 2 (|αβ|+|βα|).
Therefore, both AˆBˆ + BˆAˆ and iAˆBˆ − iBˆAˆ are Hermitian. 
2.4 The following operators are not Hermitian. Add additional (minimum number 
of) terms and make these operators Hermitian.

For the above identity to be true, Aˆ2 = 1. For this case, it is also easy to show that

We have confidence that the human spirit will always be able to 
create ideas fitting somehow to the external objects that are 
conveyed to us . . . 
— Wolfgang Pauli 
Abstract This chapter describes the solution of the time independent Schrödinger 
equation of a harmonic oscillator and shows how the requirement of physically 
well-behaving eigenfunction leads to the quantization of the harmonic oscillator 
energy. The solution and its properties are then used for a quantum mechanical 
description of vibrational states of a diatomic molecule that can be represented by a 
harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with reduced mass. Infrared absorption and Raman 
spectroscopies are introduced, and their selection rules for the case of diatomic 
molecules are explained. A brief account of how the effects going beyond the 
harmonic oscillator model for diatomic molecule is provided. 
The harmonic oscillator is one of the simplest but the most widely used models 
in physics, chemistry, and engineering. An analytical solution of the Schrödinger 
equation for the harmonic oscillator is well known and is described in this chapter. 
Details of a harmonic oscillator system also clarify important features of quantum 
mechanical states and energies distinct from those of classical mechanics. Solutions 
of the quantum harmonic oscillator have contributed immensely to understanding 
molecular vibrations and a correct quantum mechanical interpretation of spectro￾scopic data.

massless spring with linear 
restoring force 
to the equilibrium length, namely, x = l − l0. The force applied to the particle at x
is then given by 
F (x) = −k(l − l0) = −kx, (3.1) 
where k is the spring constant. The Newtonian equation for the mass attached to the 
spring is then equal to 
m d2
dt2 x(t) = −kx(t) = −mω2x(t), (3.2) 
where ω = √k/m. It is straightforward to show that the solution of the above 
equation is 
x(t) = x(0) cos(ωt) + p(0)
mω sin(ωt), (3.3) 
where x(0) and p(0) are position and momentum at time t = 0. The classical 
momentum of the particle can be calculated by taking the time derivative of the 
above expression as follows: 
p(t) = m d
dt x(t) = p(0) cos(ωt) − mωx(0)sin(ωt). (3.4) 
On the other hand, the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator is 
H = p2
2m + mω2
2 x2, (3.5) 
where the second term is the potential energy of the harmonic oscillator at x. It is 
straightforward to show that the time dependent position and momentum given by 
Eqs. (3.3) and (3.4) conserve the above Hamiltonian.3.2 Schrödinger Equation 71
Now, let us assume that the particle no longer behaves classically but should 
be considered as a quantum mechanical particle. Then, determining the position 
and momentum of the particle both simultaneously and precisely has no physical 
meaning in quantum mechanics. As yet, the expression for the Hamiltonian, 
Eq. (3.5), remains valid except that the position and momentum be replaced with 
operators as follows: 
Hˆ = pˆ2
2m + mω2
2 xˆ2. (3.6) 
Solving the time independent Schrödinger equation for the above Hamiltonian is the 
first step for understanding how the quantum harmonic oscillator can be described 
and probed. This is also essential for correct quantum mechanical understanding of 
molecular vibrations. 
3.2 Schrödinger Equation 
The time independent Schrödinger equation (in the Dirac notation) for the harmonic 
oscillator Hamiltonian, Eq. (3.6), is 
Hˆ |ψ =  pˆ2

where we have moved all the terms to the lefthand side and changed the sign so that 
the second derivative becomes positive. Detailed mathematical steps for solving this 
differential equation are provided below.72 3 Harmonic Oscillator and Vibrational Spectroscopy
3.2.1 Solution of Time Independent Schrödinger Equation 
As the first step for solving Eq. (3.9), let us introduce a new scaled coordinate ξ = √γ x, where γ is yet unknown real parameter with a unit of inverse length square, 
and also define φ(ξ ) = ψ(x). Then, dξ = √γdx and 
d2
dx2 ψ(x) = γ
d2
dξ 2 φ(ξ ). (3.10) 
Employing the above relationship in Eq. (3.9), one can obtain the following 
equation: 
h¯
2γ
2m
d2φ(ξ )
dξ 2 +

E − mω2
2γ
ξ 2

φ(ξ ) = 0. (3.11) 
Dividing the above equation with h¯
2γ /(2m), we obtain 
d2φ(ξ )
dξ 2 +
2mE
h¯
2γ − m2ω2
h¯
2γ 2 ξ 2

φ(ξ ) = 0. (3.12) 
The above equation has two parameters within the parenthesis, one as a constant 
and the other as a coefficient of ξ 2. Now, the free parameter γ can be determined to 
remove the second one. Namely, by choosing γ = mω/h¯, the above equation can 
be simplified as follows: 
d2φ(ξ )
dξ 2 + (κ − ξ 2)φ(ξ ) = 0, (3.13) 
where 
κ = 2mE
h¯
2γ = 2E
hω¯ . (3.14) 
While Eq. (3.13) appears to be simple, its conventional solution as a power series 
expansion of φ(ξ ) with respect to ξ is not straightforward because the resulting 
equation involves three different powers of ξ . A well-known technique to overcome 
this difficulty is to factor out a term that dominates for large ξ limit, which then 
helps identifying an equation that results in a simpler relationship involving only 
two powers of ξ . 
Inspection of Eq. (3.13) shows that the term −ξ 2φ(ξ ) becomes one of dominant 
terms in the large ξ limit. For this term to be cancelled by the second derivative 
term, φ(ξ ) should have a term that contains e−ξ 2/2 that produces a term with ξ 2 as3.2 Schrödinger Equation 73
a multiplicative factor when second derivative is taken. Thus, let us introduce a new 
function H (ξ ) such that 
φ(ξ ) = e−ξ 2/2H (ξ ). (3.15) 
Then, 
d
dξ φ(ξ )= −ξe−ξ 2/2H (ξ ) + e−ξ 2/2H
(ξ ), (3.16) 
d2 
dξ 2 φ(ξ )= −e−ξ 2/2H (ξ ) + ξ 2e−ξ 2/2H (ξ ) − 2ξe−ξ 2/2 d

=(ξ 2 − 1)φ(ξ ) − 2ξe−ξ 2/2 d
dξ H (ξ ) + e−ξ 2/2 d2 
dξ 2 H (ξ ). (3.17) 
Inserting the above expression into Eq. (3.13), we obtain 
d2
dξ 2 φ(ξ ) + (κ − ξ 2)φ(ξ )
= (κ − 1)e−ξ 2/2H (ξ ) − 2ξe−ξ 2/2 dH (ξ )
dξ + e−ξ 2/2 d2
dξ 2 H (ξ )
= e−ξ 2/2
 d2
dξ 2 H (ξ ) − 2ξ
d
dξ H (ξ ) + (κ − 1)H (ξ )
= 0. (3.18) 
Since e−ξ 2/2 is nonzero, the above equation implies that 
d2
dξ 2 H (ξ ) − 2ξ
d
dξ H (ξ ) + (κ − 1)H (ξ ) = 0. (3.19) 
While the above differential equation has an additional term involving the first 
derivative, it has the same order as the original function H (ξ ) because of the 
additional multiplicative factor ξ . Thus, when a power series solution is assumed 
for H (ξ ), a simple recursion relationship involving terms with only two different 
powers of ξ appears. 
Indeed, Eq. (3.19) is a well-known differential equation called the Hermite 
equation. The solution of this equation and the condition for κ that allows well￾behaving solution can be found as described below. Let us assume the following 
power series expansion for H (ξ ): 
H (ξ ) = C0 + C1ξ + C2ξ 2 +···+ Cnξ n + Cn+1ξ n+1 + Cn+2ξ n+2 + ...
(3.20)74 3 Harmonic Oscillator and Vibrational Spectroscopy
Taking the first and second derivatives of the above expression, we find that 
d
dξ H (ξ ) = C1 + 2C2ξ +···+ nCnξ n−1
+(n + 1)Cn+1ξ n + (n + 2)Cn+2ξ n+1 + ..., (3.21) 
d2 
dξ 2 H (ξ ) = 2C2 +···+ n(n − 1)Cnξ n−2 
+(n + 1)nCn+1ξ n−1 + (n + 2)(n + 1)Cn+2ξ n + .... (3.22) 
Inserting Eqs. (3.20)–(3.22) into Eq. (3.19) and requiring that the coefficient of each 
term ξ n is zero lead to the following relation between coefficients: 
(n + 2)(n + 1)Cn+2 − 2nCn + (κ − 1)Cn = 0. (3.23) 
Solving the above equation with respect to Cn+2, we obtain the following recursion 
relationship: 
Cn+2 = 2n − κ + 1
(n + 2)(n + 1)
Cn. (3.24) 
It is easy to find that the above recursion relationship implies that Cn+2 should be 
zero for some finite n in order for the wave function to be physically acceptable. 
This can be shown as follows. 
For simplicity, let us assume that C1 = 0. Then, we only need to consider even 
terms. For large n = 2n >> (κ − 1)/2&1, Eq. (3.24) approximately becomes 
C2(n
+1) ≈ 4n
2(n + 1)2n
C2n. (3.25) 
The above relation implies that C2n ≈ C0/n
! for large n
. In this case, H (ξ ) ∼
C0eξ 2
for large ξ . When this expression is used in Eq. (3.15), the resulting 
wavefunction behaves as follows: 
φ(ξ ) ∼ C0e−ξ 2/2eξ 2
= C0eξ 2/2 as ξ → ∞. (3.26) 
For nonzero C1, following a similar reasoning, the function can be shown to contain 
a term that behaves as C1ξeξ 2/2 for large ξ as well. 
The asymptotic behavior of Eq. (3.26) shows that φ(ξ ) is not an acceptable 
solution, if the series for H (ξ ) continue up to an infinite order, because it means 
that the probability to find the position to be at infinity is infinitely large, which is 
unphysical. The only way out of this is for the series Eq. (3.20) to terminate at finite 
order. Then, H (ξ ) becomes a polynomial and φ(ξ ) = H (ξ )e−ξ 2/2 becomes zero for3.2 Schrödinger Equation 75
ξ → ∞. Inspection of Eq. (3.24) shows that the termination of the series is possible 
if the following condition is satisfied. 
κ = 2v + 1, v = 0, 1,... (3.27) 
Employing the definition of κ given by Eq. (3.14), we find that the above condition 
implies that the energy should have the following form: 
Ev = hω¯

v +
1
2

, v = 0, 1,... (3.28) 
The corresponding solution for each v, Hv(ξ ), is called a Hermite polynomial, 
which is a polynomial of ξ with maximum power of v. 
Since the recursion relationship, Eq. (3.24), involves terms with two order 
difference in ξ , solutions should consist of terms with even or odd powers of ξ
depending on the value of v. That is, for even v, solution for Eq. (3.24) exists 
only for C1 = 0. For odd v, the solution exists only for C0 = 0. Examples of 
these polynomials, known as Hermite polynomials, and a few terms for general 
expressions are provided in Table 3.1. 
On the other hand, it is also known that the above Hermite polynomials can be 
generated from a Gaussian-type function as follows: 
e−s2+2sξ = ∞
v=0
1
v!
Hv(ξ )sv, (3.29) 
where the left hand side is called the generating function of the Hermite polynomial.

can be expressed as 
ψv(x) = Nve−γ x2/2Hv(
√γ x), (3.30)

condition for the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator.
• Recursion relationship involving three consecutive Hermite polynomials: 
Hv+1(ξ ) − 2ξHv(ξ ) + 2vHv−1(ξ ) = 0. (3.34)

polynomials from H0(ξ ) and H1(ξ ).
• Relationship involving the derivative of a Hermite polynomial:

only the term involving H2 
v (ξ ) survives. Thus, 78 3 Harmonic Oscillator and Vibrational Spectroscopy

Note that Eq. (3.36) is the special case of the above identity for v = v
. The above 
identity implies that the measurement of xˆ causes the transition of vibrational state 
from v to v ± 1. This fact has important implications for the selection rule of the 
spectroscopy detecting molecular vibrational states. 
3.2.2 Operator Approach 
The commutator between the Hamiltonian, Eq. (3.6), and the position operator is 
given by

xˆ[ ˆx, pˆ]+[ˆx, pˆ] ˆx

Combining Eqs. (3.47) and (3.48), we find that 
[H , ˆ mωxˆ + ipˆ]=−ihω¯ pˆ − hmω ¯ 2xˆ = −hω(mω ¯ xˆ + ip), ˆ (3.49) 
[H , ˆ mωxˆ − ipˆ]=−ihω¯ pˆ + hmω ¯ 2xˆ = hω(mω ¯ xˆ − ip). ˆ (3.50) 
The above identities motivate definition of two important operators as described 
below. 
Definition 3.1 For the harmonic oscillator with mass m and angular frequency ω, 
its lowering and raising operators bˆ and bˆ† are defined as follows: 
bˆ = 1

The lowering and raising operators defined above have the following important 
properties. 80 3 Harmonic Oscillator and Vibrational Spectroscopy

Equation (3.57) is equivalent to Eq. (3.6), and offers an efficient way to obtain 
some of the key properties of the quantum harmonic oscillator. As will be shown 
below, this expression allows to deduce the details of how the eigenvalues are 
quantized even without solving the Schrödinger equation. 
For now, let us assume that we have no knowledge of the solution of the 
Schrödinger equation in the previous subsection. Thus, let us suppose an eigenstate 
of the Hamiltonian |E such that 
Hˆ |E = E|E, (3.58) 
where E is as yet unknown value. Then, one can show that bˆ|E and bˆ†|E are 
eigenstates of Hˆ with different eigenvalues using the commutation relations. For 
example, 
[H , ˆ bˆ]|E = H (ˆ bˆ|E) − b(ˆ Hˆ |E) = −hω¯ bˆ|E, (3.59) 
where Eq. (3.53) has been used. Using the assumption of Eq. (3.58) and sending 
bˆHˆ |E = Ebˆ|E to the righthand side, the above equation implies that 
H (ˆ bˆ|E) = (E − hω) ¯ bˆ|E. (3.60) 3.2 Schrödinger Equation 81 
Thus bˆ|E is an eigenstate of Hˆ but with an eigenvalue E −hω¯ , which is lower than 
the original value by hω¯ . Similarly, one can show that 
H (ˆ bˆ†|E) = (E + hω) ¯ bˆ†|E. (3.61) 
Thus, bˆ† is an eigenstate of Hˆ but with a different eigenvalue E + hω¯ , which is 
higher than the original value by hω¯ . 
The Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator is positive definite. Therefore, 
E|Hˆ |E = E ≥ 0. (3.62) 
Let us denote the lowest energy state as |E0. Then, it is clear that bˆ|E0 = 0. If 
this is not the case, bˆ|E0 becomes an eigenstate of Hˆ with eigenvalue of E0 − hω¯ , 
which contradicts the assumption that E0 is the lowest possible value. This in turn 
implies that 
Hˆ |E0 = hω( ¯ bˆ†bˆ +
1 
2 
)|E0 =
hω¯
2 |E0. (3.63) 
Therefore, 
E0 = hω¯
2 . (3.64) 
Now, let us denote |E0 as |0 and assume that it is normalized. Then, we can 
generate eigenstates with eigenvalues hω(v ¯ +1/2) by applying bˆ† on |0 by v times 
repeatedly. Let us denote the normalized eigenstates generated in such a way as |v. 
In other words, 
bˆ†|v = Av|v + 1, v = 0, 1, 2,··· , (3.65) 
where we have introduced a constant factor Av because bˆ† does not conserve 
normalization. This can be shown by taking inner product of bˆ†|v with itself as 
follows:

|v = v + 1 = |Av|
2, (3.66) 
where Eqs. (3.55) and (3.56) were used in the first equality, and the fact that Hˆ |v =
hω(v ¯ + 1/2) was used in the second equality. The last equality is from Eq. (3.65) 
along with the fact that |v is normalized. Therefore, we find that 
bˆ†|v = √
v + 1|v + 1. (3.67) 82 3 Harmonic Oscillator and Vibrational Spectroscopy 
This implies that the vth eigenstate can be defined as 
|v =

√v!
(bˆ†)
v|0, (3.68) 
where |v is normalized and 
Hˆ |v = hω(v ¯ +
1 
2 
)|v. (3.69) 
Note that the above equation is nothing but the time independent Schrödinger 
equation for the eigenvalue, Eq. (3.28). It is remarkable that this result can be 
obtained purely out of the commutator relationship between Hˆ , bˆ, and bˆ† and that 
there has to be a lower bound in the eigenvalue. 
In a similar manner to obtaining Eq. (3.67), we can obtain the following identity 
involving the operation of bˆ. 
bˆ|v = √v|v − 1, v = 1, 2, 3,... . (3.70) 
This identity can be used to confirm that the eigenvalues hω(v ¯ +1/2)’s are the only 
eigenvalues possible for the harmonic oscillator.

3.3 Vibrational Spectroscopy of Diatomic Molecules 
Let us consider a diatomic molecule consisting of two atomic masses m1 and 
m2. At the simplest level, their bonding can be modeled by an ideal spring with 
spring constant k. If we denote the two coordinates along the internuclear axis as l1 
and l2 (see Fig. 3.3) and assume that their dynamics are governed by the classical 
mechanics, we arrive at the following equations of motion: 
d2 
dt2 l1 = − k
m1 
(r0 − l2 + l1), (3.77) 
d2 
dt2 l2 = − k
m2 
(l2 − l1 − r0). (3.78) 
In above equations, r0 is the equilibrium bond distance where there is no restoring 
force of the spring. From the difference of the above two equations, one can obtain 
the following equation of motion for l = l2 − l1: 
d2 
dt2 l = −k
m1 + m2 
m1m2 
(l − r0). (3.79) 84 3 Harmonic Oscillator and Vibrational Spectroscopy 
Fig. 3.3 Illustration of two 
masses m1 and m2 connected 
by an ideal massless spring 
with linear restoring force 
Let us introduce the displacement from the equilibrium bond distance, x = l − r0, 
and a reduced mass μ = m1m2/(m1 + m2). Then, the above equation simplifies to 
d2 
dt2 x = − k
μx = −ω2x, (3.80) 
where ω = √k/μ. Thus, within the classical mechanics, the dynamics of x is 
equivalent to that of a harmonic oscillator with an effective mass μ, for which the 
classical Hamiltonian is given by 
H = p2 
2μ
+ μω2 
2 x2. (3.81) 
If the above assumption of the classical mechanics were true, it means that the 
displacement x(t) and its momentum p(t) = μdx(t)/dt should go through the 
following harmonic time evolution 
x(t) = x(0) cos(ωt) + p(0)
μω
sin(ωt), (3.82) 
p(t) = p(0) cos(ωt) − μωx(0)sin(ωt), (3.83) 
for which the Hamiltonian H = p(0)2/(2μ) + μω2x(0)2/2 remains conserved and 
can have an arbitrary value depending only on the initial value of the displacement 
and the momentum. 
Quantum mechanically, one has to consider the following Hamiltonian operator 
corresponding to Eq. (3.81): 
Hˆ = pˆ2 
2μ
+
1 
2 
μω2xˆ2, (3.84) 3.3 Vibrational Spectroscopy of Diatomic Molecules 85 
where xˆ and pˆ are now operators that should obey the commutator relationship 
[ ˆx, pˆ] = ih¯. The solution for the Schrödinger equation for the above Hamiltonian 
is the same as the one presented in Sect. 3.2 except that 
γ = μω
h¯ , (3.85) 
for the present case. Thus, the expressions for the eigenvalue, Eq. (3.28), and the 
eigenfunction, Eq. (3.30), remain the same. 
One of the important consequences is that the minimum vibrational energy of 
the diatomic molecule is no longer zero but becomes hω/ ¯ 2 = h¯
√k/μ/2. This also 
means that the internuclear distance and the corresponding momentum can never 
become zero simultaneously. For the ground vibrational state, the uncertainties of 
relative position and momentum of the two atoms within the diatomic molecules 
can be calculated to be 
σx =

h¯
2μω, (3.86) 
σp =
μhω¯
2 . (3.87) 
These satisfy the minimum possible value of the Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation￾ship, σxσp = h/¯ 2. 
3.3.1 Vibrational Absorption or Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy 
The quantum mechanical behavior of interatomic displacement in a diatomic 
molecule can be confirmed from its interaction with light, viewed as electromagnetic 
radiation. Detailed mathematical treatment of the interaction will be provided later. 
For now, it is sufficient to accept that the lowest order interaction of light with the 
displacement is through the dipole moment of the molecule, which is in general 
defined as 
D = 
i
qiri, (3.88) 
where ri is the coordinate of the ith particle constituting the molecule. For the 
case of vibrational spectroscopy, each ri can be viewed as the coordinate of each 
nuclei and qi the effective point charge of each nucleus, with the effects of electrons 
incorporated. For the case of a diatomic molecule with their internuclear coordinate 
x + r0, the dipole moment operator along the internuclear axis is given by 
Dˆ = q(xˆ + r0), (3.89) 86 3 Harmonic Oscillator and Vibrational Spectroscopy 
Fig. 3.4 Diatomic molecule 
and their effective charge and 
internuclear distance. The 
arrow represents the dipole 
moment 
where xˆ is now viewed as quantum mechanical position operator and q is the 
magnitude of the effective charge (see Fig. 3.4). 
The simplest vibrational spectroscopy is the one where molecular vibrational 
states changes through the lowest order interaction with light. This is conventionally 
known as Infrared (IR) spectroscopy because it turns out that the molecular 
vibrational frequencies are typically in the range of IR. There are two important 
selection rules as described below. 
Selection Rules for IR Spectroscopy
• The first is called gross selection rule stated as follows: Only vibrational 
modes that cause change of dipole moment are IR active. For diatomic 
molecules, this means that the molecular has to be polar. Therefore, only 
heteroatomic diatomic molecules are IR active.
• For those molecules that are IR active, the transition that is allowed (given 
that the harmonic oscillator form of the Hamiltonian is exact) is the 
following transition: 
v = ±1. (3.90) 
This can be understood from that the IR spectroscopy amounts to applying 
the dipole operator given by Eq. (3.89) to a given eigenstate, which then 
makes transition to another eigenstate. Due to the identity of Eq. (3.46), 
such measurement causes transitions to only nearby eigenstates satisfying 
Eq. (3.90). 
IR spectroscopy is typically an absorption spectroscopy where a photon is 
absorbed to excite the vibrational state. Thus, within the assumption of the harmonic 
oscillator model, the energy of the photon being absorbed in the IR spectroscopy is 
given by 
hνph = hω¯

v + 1 +
1 
2

− hω¯

v +
1 
2

= hω, ¯ (3.91) 
where νph is the frequency of the photon being absorbed and ω is the vibrational 
angular frequency of the molecule that appears in the Hamiltonian, Eq. (3.84). 3.3 Vibrational Spectroscopy of Diatomic Molecules 87 
The IR spectroscopy is most commonly described in terms of wavenumber, 
ν˜ph = νph/c, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Equation (3.91) can then 
be expressed in terms of the wavenumber as follows: 
ν˜ph = h¯
2πch¯
ω = 1 
2πcω = 1 
2πc  k
μ
1/2 
. (3.92) 
For the description of the IR spectroscopy, it is often convenient to introduce the 
following vibrational term: 
G(v) = ˜νvib 
v +
1 
2

, (3.93) 
where 
ν˜vib = 1 
2πc  k
μ
1/2 
. (3.94) 
Then, the condition for the IR absorption, Eq. (3.92), reduces to 
ν˜ph = ˜νvib. (3.95) 
3.3.2 Vibrational Raman Spectroscopy 
The next order of interaction between light and molecule is through the polarizabil￾ity α of the molecule, which is defined by 
Dind = αE. (3.96) 
This interaction term is quadratic with respect to the amplitude of the field because 
it involves interaction of the above induced dipole with the electromagnetic field 
again. 
The polarizability α is a matrix in general (second rank tensor) but can be repre￾sented by a number for its portion that depends on the vibrational displacement of 
the diatomic molecule. This can again be expanded with respect to the displacement 
x as follows: 
αˆ = α(0) + ˆx ∂α
∂x




x=0 
+··· . (3.97) 
This expression shows that the first order interaction term of the molecule with 
radiation is proportional to the vibrational displacement. This fact leads to the 
following selection rules for the vibrational Raman spectroscopy. 88 3 Harmonic Oscillator and Vibrational Spectroscopy 
Selection Rules for Vibrational Raman Spectroscopy
• Any vibrational mode that causes change of polarizability is Raman active. 
This means that even homonuclear diatomic molecule is in general Raman 
active because the distance dependence of polarizability is nonzero.
• As in the case of IR spectroscopy, the following selection rule applies to 
vibrational Raman. 
v = ±1. (3.98) 
Unlike the case of IR, Raman Spectroscopy is a scattering process where 
the frequency difference between in-coming radiation and out-going radiation (in 
directions perpendicular to in-coming light) is measured. The case where the 
outgoing light has lower energy corresponds to v = 1 and is called Stokes 
vibrational transition, which is similar to classical inelastic scattering processes 
that involve loss of energy. The case where the outgoing light has higher energy 
corresponds to the case of v = −1 and is called anti-Stokes vibrational 
transition, a counter-intuitive process that light extracts energy out of molecules. 
3.3.3 Anharmonic Effects 
For actual molecules, the potential energy in general deviates from the quadratic 
dependence as shown in Fig. 3.5. Note that the actual potential energy becomes 
stiffer (softer) than a quadratic function as the distance becomes smaller (larger). 
The resulting deviation of the properties of the vibrational motion from those of a 
harmonic oscillator is called anharmonicity. In general, the potential energy between 
a diatomic molecule can be expanded as 
V (x) = V (0) + mω2 
2 x2 +
V (3)
(0)
6 x3 +
V (4)
(0)
24 x4 +··· , (3.99) 
where V (n)(0) = ∂nV (x)/∂xn|x=0. Solving the Schrödinger equation exactly for 
the general expansion of the potential energy as given above is a difficult task with 
the exception of few models such as the Morse potential. For the calculation of 
general anharmonic contributions, one has to rely on approximation methods that 
you will learn in later chapters of this book, which are valid if the contribution of 
anharmonic terms are small compared to the harmonic terms. 
In actual analyses of spectroscopic data, the following empirical expressions have 
been frequently used.

The quantum energy levels for actual potential and the harmonic oscillator levels for the parabolic 
approximation are shown. The potential energy depth De and the dissociation energy D0 for actual

Two major effects of anharmonicity are (1) non-uniform level spacing and 
(2) finite dissociation energy (see Fig. 3.5). In general, the potential well-depth 
is denoted as De and the dissociation energy is denoted as D0. The difference 
between these two is the zero point energy of the vibrational motion. According 
to Eq. (3.100), the expression for this is as follows: 
De − D0 = 1

hω¯ e − 1

point energy. 90 3 Harmonic Oscillator and Vibrational Spectroscopy 
3.4 Summary and Questions 
The time independent Schrödinger equation for a harmonic oscillator has exact 
solutions. Eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are given by Eq. (3.28), which are 
quantized with an equal spacing. The corresponding eigenfunctions are given by 
Eq. (3.30), which are given by Hermite polynomials (listed in Table 3.1) multiplied 
with a common Gaussian function. The quantization of the eigenvalue arises from 
the requirement that the eigenfunctions remain finite and that its squares are 
integrable over the entire value of the position. The ground vibrational state of the 
harmonic oscillator is a minimum uncertainty state that satisfies Eq. (3.45). 
By introducing bˆ and bˆ†, lowering and raising operators that are defined by 
Eqs. (3.51) and (3.52), one can express the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator 
in the form of Eq. (3.57). The raising operator, when applied to an eigenstate of 
the Hamiltonian, produces the next higher eigenstate according to Eq. (3.67). The 
lowering operator, when applied to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, produces 
the next lower eigenstate according to Eq. (3.70). Application of the lowering 
operator to the ground vibrational state results in a null state, which means that 
the state does not exist any more. It is possible to make a complete description of a 
quantum harmonic oscillator, including the dynamics, solely in terms of expressions 
involving bˆ and bˆ†. 
The vibrational motion of a diatomic molecule, given that the interatomic 
potential energy is well approximated by a quadratic function of the relative 
displacement, can be represented by a harmonic oscillator with a reduce mass μ as 
defined below Eq. (3.79). Thus, the eigenfunction and eigenvalue of the harmonic 
oscillator with the reduced mass can be used for quantum mechanical understanding 
of the molecular vibration and selection rules for IR and Raman spectroscopies as 
given by Eqs. (3.90) and (3.98). For diatomic molecules with soft potential energy 
and/or in high vibrational states, the harmonic oscillator assumption breaks down. 
The resulting anharmonic effects can be effectively represented by the modification 
of the expression for the vibration energy as in Eq. (3.100), although this expression 
is empirical.

Solution 3.9 The identity I can be proved as follows. First, using 
e−iHt/ ˆ h¯ |v = e−iω(v+1/2)t|v,
one can show that 
eiHt/ ˆ h¯ beˆ −iHt/ ˆ h¯ |v =

e−iω(v+1/2)t .
Since bˆ|v is an eigenstate of Hˆ with eigenvalue hω(v ¯ − 1 + 1/2) = hω(v ¯ − 1/2), 
eiHt/ ˆ h¯ bˆ|v = eiω(v−1/2)tbˆ|v.
Therefore, 
I : eiHt/ ˆ h¯ beˆ −iHt/ ˆ h¯ |v = eiω(v−1/2)t e−iω(v+1/2)tbˆ|v = e−iωtbˆ|v.
Similarly, the identity II can be proved first recognizing that 
eiHt/ ˆ h¯ bˆ†e−iHt/ ˆ h¯ |v = eiHt/ ˆ h¯ bˆ†|ve−iω(v+1/2)t .
Since bˆ†|v is an eigenstate of Hˆ with eigenvalue hω(v ¯ + 1/2) = hω(v ¯ + 3/2), 
eiHt/ ˆ h¯ bˆ†|v = eiω(v+3/2)tbˆ†|v.
Therefore, 
II : eiHt/ ˆ h¯ bˆ†e−iHt/ ˆ h¯ |v = eiω(v+3/2)t e−iω(v+1/2)tbˆ†|v = eiωtbˆ†|v.

Multidimensional Systems 
and Separation of Variables 
There’s no sense in being precise when you don’t even know 
what you’re talking about. 
— John von Neumann 
Abstract This chapter provides time independent Schrödinger equations for a 
quantum particle in three dimensional space and many interacting quantum particles 
in multidimensional space. As the simplest example, a quantum particle in a three 
dimensional box is considered. The corresponding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions 
are provided employing the separation of variables method. These solutions are 
used to illustrate the concept of degeneracy. Then, a more general description of the 
separation of variables method is provided. As an application, quantum mechanical 
description of the multidimensional vibrational motion of a polyatomic molecules, 
within the harmonic oscillator approximation for each normal mode, is presented. 
So far, we have considered one dimensional motion in order to understand the 
principles and features of quantum mechanics as clearly as possible. However, 
hardly anything is one dimensional. Typically, the motion of a single particle needs 
to be considered in three dimensional physical space. If there are N particles 
interacting in three dimensional space, we need to consider a 3N dimensional 
mathematical space in order to provide complete description of the system even 
for the description within the classical mechanics. 
It turns out that extending quantum mechanical position and momentum oper￾ators and their corresponding eigenstates to multidimensional spaces is straight￾forward at least in Cartesian coordinate systems, where one dimensional position 
and momentum states along each direction can be combined independently to form 
the multidimensional space. The corresponding states can also be defined in a

straightforward manner by direct products, as defined in Sect. 2.5. This results in 
expansion of the dimension of the corresponding vector space of states to that of 
the power of 3N. This chapter provides detailed consideration of these states and 
introduces a simple separation of variables method for solving the multidimensional 
Schrödinger equation. 
4.1 Three Dimensional System 
4.1.1 Position, Momentum, Hamiltonian, and Schrödinger 
Equation 
The position and momentum operator defined in one dimension can be extended to 
three dimension through a direct product of those for x, y, and z as described in 
Sect. 2.5. This then allows straightforward extension of Schrödinger’s equation to 
three dimension. 
Taking the Hermitian adjoint of the three dimensional position ket |r defined by 
Eq. (2.93), leads to the following three dimensional position bra: 
r|=x|⊗y|⊗z|. (4.1) 
Then, for a quantum mechanical state |ψ representing a particle in three dimension, 
the value of the corresponding Schrödinger’s wave function at r can be defined as 
the following inner product: 
ψ(r) = r|ψ. (4.2) 
If |ψ corresponds to another position ket |r
, the above identity leads to the three 
dimensional Dirac-delta function as follows:1 
δ(r − r
) = r|r
. (4.3) 
The above identities are equivalent to the following completeness relation that 
expresses the identity operator in terms of outer products of positions states.
1 This three dimensional Dirac delta function, or distribution, satisfies the two conditions that 
 dr
δ(r − r
)f (r
) = f (r) for any integrable function f (r) and δ(r − r
) = 0 for r = r
, 
where  dr =  dx  dy  dz in the Cartesian coordinate system. 4.1 Three Dimensional System 103
Completeness of Three Dimensional States 
Three dimensional position states form a complete basis and integration of 
its outer products over the entire space is equal to the identity operator as 
expressed below. 
1ˆ =

dr|rr| = lim
δr→0

i
δr|riri|. (4.4) 
The above identity is a three dimensional analogue of Eq. (2.25) and the 
second equality simply represents the mathematical definition of the inte￾gration as the limit of the sum over smaller volume elements δr becoming 
infinitesimally small. 
The above completeness relation implies that any quantum mechanical state |ψ
describing a quantum particle in three dimensional space can be represented as a 
linear combination of the position states. Thus, 
|ψ = 
dr |rr|ψ = 
dr ψ(r)|r = lim
δr→0

i
δrψ(ri)|ri, (4.5) 
where Eq. (4.2) has been used. The second equality in the above equation shows 
that δrψ(ri) is nothing but the coefficient for |ri in the representation of the state 
as a linear combination of the position states. 
Taking the Hermitian adjoint of Eq. (2.94), we obtain 
r|rˆ = r|r = rr|, (4.6) 
where the fact that the position operator is a Hermitian operator and that r is a real￾valued vector has been used. Applying the above identity to a state ket |ψ, we then 
obtain 
r|rˆ|ψ = rr|ψ = rψ(r), (4.7) 
which is a three dimensional generalization of Eq. (2.24). Application of this 
identity for the case where the state is rˆ|ψ leads to 
r||rˆ|
2|ψ=r|rˆ · rˆ|ψ
= r|rˆ ·

rˆ|ψ

= r · r|rˆ|ψ
= r · rr|ψ=|r|
2r|ψ. (4.8)104 4 Multidimensional Systems and Separation of Variables
For any function V (r), one can use Eq. (4.7) repeatedly for a Taylor expansion of 
V (r) and obtain 
r|V (rˆ)|ψ = V (r)r|ψ = V (r)ψ(r). (4.9) 
In other words, applying an operator V (rˆ) to a state |ψ simply amounts to 
multiplying ψ(r) (the position representation of |ψ) with the function V (r). 
As the next step, let us consider the momentum operator in the three dimensional 
space, pˆ = ˆpx ex + ˆpy ey + ˆpzez, as introduced in Sect. 2.5. Here, each component 
is defined by its effect on the corresponding position ket as follows: 
pˆx |x=−

∂
∂y |y, (4.11) 
pˆz|z=−
h¯
i
∂
∂z |z. (4.12) 
On the other, each component does not have any effect on the position states of other 
components. For example, pˆx does not have any effect on |y and |z. Therefore, 
application of pˆ to |r leads to 
pˆ|r = (pˆx ex + ˆpy ey + ˆpzez)|x⊗|y⊗|z
= ex

pˆx |x

where 
∇ = ex
∂
∂x + ey
∂
∂y + ez
∂
∂z . (4.14) 
The Hermitian adjoint of Eq. (4.13) is 
r|pˆ = h¯
i
∇r|. (4.15) 
Taking inner product of the above identity with an arbitrary ket |ψ, we find a 
key identity that establishes the effect of momentum operation on arbitrary state 
as described below.4.1 Three Dimensional System 105
Implication of Three Dimensional Momentum Operation 
For an arbitrary state |ψ, 
r|pˆ|ψ =
h¯
i
∇r|ψ =
h¯
i
∇ψ(r). (4.16) 
The last term in the above equation is the definition of the momentum operator 
in Schrödinger’s formulation of quantum mechanics. The complex conjugate 
of the above identity is 
ψ|pˆ|r = 
r|pˆ|ψ
∗ = −h¯
i
∇ψ∗(r) = −h¯
i
∇ψ|r. (4.17) 
This identity can in fact be obtained more easily by taking the inner product 
of Eq. (4.13) with ψ| and employing the fact that ψ|∇|r = ∇ψ|r. 
In a way similar to Eq. (4.8), application of Eq. (4.16) twice leads to

Summing up all the definitions and identities provided above, now we can find a 
general expression for the time independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in 
three dimensional space as describe below. 
Time Independent Schrödinger Equation in Three Dimension 
The Hamiltonian operator for a quantum mechanical particle subject to a 
potential energy V (r) in a three dimensional space is 
Hˆ = |pˆ|
2
2m + V (rˆ). (4.20) 
(continued)106 4 Multidimensional Systems and Separation of Variables
Thus, the time independent Schrödinger equation for the particle in the Dirac 
notation is 
Hˆ |ψE ≡ |pˆ|
2
2m + V (rˆ)

|ψE = E|ψE, (4.21) 
where |ψE is the eigenket of Hˆ with energy E. Taking inner product of the 
above equation with r| and using Eqs. (4.9) and (4.18), one can obtain the 
original Schrödinger’s equation for time independent wavefunction in three￾dimensional space, 
r|Hˆ |ψE ≡ 	
− h¯
2
2m∇2 + V (r)


ψE(r) = EψE(r), (4.22) 
where ψE(r) ≡ r|ψE. The above equation is the position representation of 
the Schrödinger equation in the Dirac notation. Solving this time independent 
Schrödinger equation is an important first step for understanding the behavior 
of a given quantum particle in a three dimensional space. While finding 
an exact closed form solution of the above equation for a general three 
dimensional potential is difficult, a simple method of solution exists for the 
case where the potential energy can be separated into one dimensional terms. 
4.1.2 Particle in a Three Dimensional Rectangular Box 
As the simplest example, let us consider a quantum particle in the following three 
dimensional rectangular box (see Fig. 4.1): 
V3D−box (r) =
 0 , 0 < x < a, 0 < y < b, 0 <z<c ← Region I
∞ , otherwise ← Region II
(4.23) 
For this potential, it is easy to find ψE(r) = r|ψE and eigenvalue E satisfying the 
Schrödinger equation, Eq. (4.22). 
For now, let us denote the wavefunction satisfying the time independent 
Schrödinger equation for energy E as ψ(r). First, for the region II in Eq. (4.23), 
it is clear that ψ(r) = 0. Otherwise, the energy becomes infinity, which is not an 
acceptable solution. This imposes the following boundary condition to be satisfied 
by the finite wave function in region I:4.1 Three Dimensional System 107
Fig. 4.1 Three dimensional box with sides a, b, and c along x, y, and z directions 
ψ(0, y, z) = ψ(a, y, z) = ψ(x, 0, z) = ψ(x, b, z)
= ψ(x, y, 0) = ψ(x, y, c) = 0. (4.24) 
Along with the above boundary condition, Eq. (4.22) for region I reduces to

This equation can be solved by making the following assumptions: 
ψ(r) = X(x)Y (y)Z(z), (4.26) 
E = Ex + Ey + Ez. (4.27) 
Inserting Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27) into Eq. (4.25), moving Eψ(r) to the lefthand side, 
and dividing the whole equation with −h¯
2/(2m), we find that

nonzero). Then, it becomes

The above equation shows that the sum of three independent functions of x, y, 
and z, respectively, becomes zero. For this to be true in general, each term should 
become zero. Thus, the above equation, along with the boundary condition, Eq. 
(4.24), implies that

Note that each of the above equation corresponds to that for the one dimensional

the above three equations are

In the Dirac notation, the eigenstates can simply be represented by |nx , ny , nz =
|nx ⊗|ny ⊗|nz. The kets comprising this direct product are related to the 
wavefunctions given above as follows: Xnx (x) = x|nx ; Yny (y) = y|ny ; 
Znz (z) = z|nz. Thus, |nx , ny , nz satisfies the following time independent 
Schrödinger equation (in the Dirac notation):

|nx , ny , nz = Enxnynz |nx , ny , nz. (4.38) 
In the above expression, Vˆ
3D−box corresponding to Eq. (4.23) is defined as 
Vˆ
3D−box |r = V3D−box (r)|r. (4.39) 
Although the eigenstates defined by Eq. (4.38) have been determined under the 
assumption that the state is a product of those for each Cartesian coordinates, the 
general quantum states need not necessarily be such product states. This is because 
the state of a quantum particle in a box can be represented by the following linear 
combination of eigenstates: 
|ψ = ∞
nx=1
∞
ny=1

nz=1
Cnx ,ny ,nz |nx , ny , nz. (4.40)

ny=1

nz=1
Cnx ,ny ,nzψnxnynz (r). (4.41) 
It is well-known mathematically that the above expression can represent any well￾behaving function of r. Thus, the solutions based on the assumption of separation of 
variables can be used to represent any well-behaving non-separable wavefunctions 
as long as the same boundary conditions are satisfied.

Having described a simple three dimensional system, it is now appropriate to 
explain the concept of degeneracy, which plays an important role in quantum 
mechanics. For a general case where a = b = c and none of them is an 
integer multiple of the other, the energy eigenvalue Enxnynz is different for each 
set of (nx , ny , nz). However, in case the box becomes more symmetrical, some of 
the energies become the same, namely, “degenerate." In that case, that particular 
energy is said to have degeneracy and the corresponding quantum states are called 
degenerate. 
As an example, let us consider the case where a = b = c. In this case, Eq. (4.37) 
reduces to 
Enxnynz = h¯

where nx , ny , nz = 1, 2, 3,... . While the ground state |1, 1, 1 with energy E111 is 
non-degenerate, the first excited states |2, 1, 1, |1, 2, 1, and |1, 1, 2 are degenerate 
with a common eigenvalue E211. Thus, the degeneracy of this eigenvalue is 3. It is 
important to note that any linear combination of degenerate eigenstates remains the 
eigenstate. This is obvious because application of the Hamiltonian to such a state 
results in the same eigenvalue that can be factored out. For example, any linear 
combination of |2, 1, 1, |1, 2, 1, and |1, 1, 2 is an eigenstate of Hˆ with eigenvalue 
E211. 
4.1.3 Separation in Cartesian Coordinate System 
The three dimensional particle in a box problem is a special case of a more general 
situation where the three dimensional Schrödinger equation can be separated into 
three one dimensional equations. As long as the potential is given by a sum of three 
terms as 
V (r) = Vx (x) + Vy (y) + Vz(z), (4.45) 
and the boundary condition in each direction is independent of the other coordinates, 
one can assume that the energy is given by the sum of three terms as 
E = Ex + Ey + Ez, (4.46)4.1 Three Dimensional System 111
and the eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian can be assumed to have the following 
factorized form: 
ψ(r) = ψx (x)ψy (y)ψz(z). (4.47) 
Then, employing the separation of variables method as was done for the case of the 
particle in a three dimensional box, it is straightforward to show that the Schrödinger 
equation for the particle can be satisfied through the following three one dimensional 
equations:

This potential is a sum of three independent terms along the three directions. Solving

In the Dirac notation, the eigenstate of the three dimensional Harmonic oscillator 
can be expressed as 
|nx , ny , nz=|nx |ny |nz≡|nx ⊗|ny ⊗|nz. (4.57) 
The corresponding wavefunction in the position representation is obtained by taking 
the inner product of this state with a position state, r|=x|y|z|≡x|⊗y|⊗z|, 
as follows: 
ψnxnynz (r) = r|nx , ny , nz
= x|nx y|ny z|nz = ψnx (x)ψny (y)ψnz (z). (4.58) 
4.2 Many Particle Systems and the Center of Mass 
Coordinates 
The Hamiltonian operator for a quantum system consisting of N particles can 
be found by replacing their classical momentum and position with corresponding 
operators as follows: 
Hˆ = |pˆ 1|
2
2m1
+···+ |pˆ N |
2
2mN
+ V (rˆ1, ··· , rˆN ), (4.59) 
where pˆ k and rˆk for each of k = 1, ··· , N are momentum and position operators 
of particle k with mass mk. For this many-particle system, one can construct 3N
dimensional cartesian coordinates R = (r1, ··· , rN ), for which a position ket |R
can be defined through direct products, 
|R=|r1⊗···⊗|rN . (4.60) 
Let us denote a quantum state representing this N-particle system in the Dirac nota￾tion as |N . Then, the corresponding wavefunction in the position representation is 
obtained by taking the inner product of this state with the multidimensional position 
bra as follows: 
N (r1, ··· , rN ) = R|N  = 
r1|⊗···⊗rN |

|N . (4.61) 
Note that |N , even if it were an eigenstate, in general cannot be expressed as a 
direct product of the single particle states (unlike the position state) if the potential is 
not separable. Thus, the right hand side of the above expression cannot be simplified 
further unless there is some symmetry in the system.4.2 Many Particle Systems and the Center of Mass Coordinates 113
One case of simplification that is fairly common is when the potential energy can 
be separated into those for the center of mass coordinates and remaining relative 
coordinates. Before considering this case in more detail, let us define the following 
center of mass coordinates, 
rcm = m1r1 +···+ mN rN
m1 +···+ mN
. (4.62) 
Then, let us also define new relative coordinates r
1, ··· , r
N−1 that are orthogonal 
to each other and are independent of rcm. Then, the position ket for the total 
coordinates, Eq. (4.60), can alternatively be written as 
|R=|rcm⊗|r
1⊗···⊗|r
N−1 . (4.63)

V (rˆ1, ··· , rˆN ) = Vcm(rˆcm) + Vrel(rˆ



conjugate to rˆcm and rˆ
k, M is the total mass of the system and m
k (for k =
1, ··· , N − 1) is the effective mass for the kth coordinate r
k. For the above 
Hamiltonian, an eigenstate can be assumed to be a product form as follows: 
|N =|ψcm⊗|ψrel, (4.66) 
where |ψcm and |ψrel are eigenstates respectively satisfying the following 
Schrödinger equations:

4.2.1 Two-Particle System 
As an example, let us consider a system of two particles, with masses m1 and 
m2. Within the classical mechanics, it is possible to completely specify the three 
dimensional coordinates of two particles, r1 and r2, and their momenta, p1 and 
p2. For the general case where the two particles interact with each other, as was 
mentioned before, it is often best to separate the dynamics into those for the center 
of mass and relative coordinates. 
For the two particles, the center of mass coordinate is 
rcm = m1r1 + m2r2
M , (4.70) 
where M = m1 + m2, and the relative coordinate is 
rrel = r1 − r2. (4.71) 
The above two equations can be used to express r1 and r2 in terms of rcm and rrel
as follows: 
r1 = rcm + m2
M
rrel, (4.72) 
r2 = rcm − m1

Hamiltonian and Schrödinger Equation for Two Particles with Separable 
Relative Potential 
If the potential energy is a sum of those for rcm and rrel, namely, V (r1, r2) =
Vcm(rcm)+Vrel(rrel), the total classical Hamiltonian for the two particles can 
be expressed as 
H = Hcm + Hrel = p2
cm
2M + Vcm(rcm) + p2
rel
2μ
+ Vrel(rrel). (4.79) 
For the quantum mechanical case, the Hamiltonian operator is obtained by 
replacing the position and momentum variables with operators as follows: 
Hˆ = Hˆcm + Hˆrel = pˆ 2
cm
2M + Vcm(rˆcm) + pˆ 2
rel
2μ
+ Vrel(rˆrel). (4.80) 
Let us introduce |ψcm,Ecm  and |ψrel,Erel, which are respectively eigenstates 
of Hˆcm and Hˆrel as follows: 
Hˆcm|ψcm,Ecm  = Ecm|ψcm,Ecm , (4.81) 
Hˆrel|ψrel,Erel = Erel|ψrel,Erel. (4.82) 
Then, it is straightforward to show that |ψ=|ψcm,Ecm ⊗|ψrel,Erel is an 
eigenstate of Hˆ = Hˆcm + Hˆrel with eigenvalue Ecm + Erel.116 4 Multidimensional Systems and Separation of Variables
4.2.2 Normal Modes and Vibrational Spectroscopy 
of Polyatomic Molecules 
For a diatomic molecule in the absence of any external potential, the Hamiltonian 
operator given by Eq. (4.79) reduces to 
Hˆ = pˆ 2
cm
2M + pˆ 2
2μ
+ Vrel(rˆ), (4.83) 
where, note that the subscript rel used for the position operator in the previous 
subsection has been dropped here for convenience. Thus, rˆ is the operator measuring 
the relative position vector of the two nuclei and pˆ is the corresponding momentum 
operator. As will become detailed in the next chapter, the kinetic energy operator for 
the relative motion of the nuclei pˆ 2/(2μ) in the above equation can be divided into 
one dimensional motion along the radius and rotational motions that are specified by 
two independent angles. Thus, for the diatomic molecule represented by the above 
Hamiltonian, which have total of 6 degrees of freedom, there is only one vibrational 
degree of freedom. 
For polyatomic molecules with more than two nuclei, there are more than one 
vibrational degrees of freedom. For linear molecules with N atoms, the number 
of vibrational degrees of freedom, Nvib = 3N − 5. This is because there are 
two rotational degrees of freedom in addition to three degrees of freedom for 
the translational motion of the center of mass. On the other hand, for nonlinear 
molecules, there are three rotational degrees of freedom. As a result, there are 
Nvib = 3N − 6 vibrational degrees of freedom. 
Let us consider a polyatomic molecule with Nvib vibrational degrees of freedom 
and assume that it is possible2 to identify Nvib orthogonal coordinates xk’s with 
k = 1, ··· , Nvib, which represent vibrational displacements from the minimum 
potential energy. The kinetic energy term can still be expressed as a quadratic 
form involving time derivatives of these coordinates. In other words, it is assumed 
that the kinetic energy corresponding to vibrational motion can be expressed 
as 
k(mk/2)(dxk/dt)2 and that the difference of the potential energy from its 
minimum value can be expanded as follows: 
	V = V (x1, ··· , xNvib ) − V (0, ··· , 0)

Fu˜ k = λkuk, k = 1, ··· , Nvib. (4.90) 
The above eigenvectors can be chosen to be normalized. In addition, the real

In the above expression, all λj ’s are positive because the above term is a quadratic

λj is negative, the displacement of Qj , while all others remain zero, can make the 
potential energy lower than the minimum, which is contradictory. Therefore, we can 
introduce ωj such that 
λj = ω2

Taking time derivative of Eq. (4.92), we find that

of Nvib one dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians of independent normal 
modes.4.2 Many Particle Systems and the Center of Mass Coordinates 119
Molecular Vibrational Hamiltonian as a Sum of Harmonic Oscillators for

Due to the independence of amplitude along the direction of each normal

molecules as being consisting of one dimensional normal modes. Therefore,

Not all the vibrational normal modes can be detected by the IR spectroscopy 
and/or the Raman spectroscopy. As was mentioned in Chap. 3, only those modes 
for which dipole moment changes are IR active. On the other hand, vibrational 
modes for which the polarizability tensor changes with displacements are Raman 
active. There are vibrational modes that are not active either in IR or Raman, which 
are called silent modes. A systematic consideration of these vibrational modes is 
possible employing the group theory, which will be described in more detail in 
Chap. 9 where we consider overall molecular spectroscopy. 
For each of IR and Raman active modes, the allowed transitions within the 
harmonic oscillator approximation correspond to 
	vj = ±1, (4.105) 
where vj is the vibrational quantum number for either IR or Raman active mode. 
For IR absorption, only 	vj = 1 transition occurs. As was the case for diatomic 
molecule, the majority of these transitions are from the ground vibrational state 
(vj = 0) to the first excited vibrational state (vj = 1). For the Raman spectroscopy, 
	vj = 1 corresponds to Stokes transition and 	vj = −1 corresponds to anti￾Stokes transition. The Stokes transition is dominantly from the ground (vj = 0) to 
the first excited state (vj = 1), whereas the anti-Stokes transition is dominantly from 
the first excited vibration state (vj = 1) to the ground vibrational state (vj = 0). 
Relative intensities of Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks are determined by populations 
of initial states. Since thermal population of the first excited vibrational state is much 
smaller than that of the ground vibrational state for typical small to intermediate size 
molecules, intensities of Stokes peaks are much stronger than those of anti-Stokes 
peaks for these molecules. 
4.3 Summary and Questions 
Three dimensional position and momentum states can be defined as direct products 
of those for x, y, z components of the Cartesian coordinate system. Accordingly, all 
quantum mechanical operators, including the Hamiltonian, for a quantum particle 
in three dimensional space can be defined in the direct product space of those for 
the three dimensional position or momentum coordinates. Similarly, for a system of 
N interacting quantum particles, direct products of position and momentum states 
can be used to construct position and momentum states for the corresponding 3N
dimensional position and momentum vectors. The resulting direct product space of 
position or momentum in turn can be used to represent any physical observables, 
including the Hamiltonian, of the many-particle quantum system for any kind of 
interacting potentials. 
On the other hand, when it comes to finding analytical solutions for a general 
multidimensional Schrödinger equation, it is in general necessary to decompose 
the equation into those for one dimensional coordinates. The symmetry of a given4.3 Summary and Questions 121
system plays an important role in such decomposition. For the case of a particle 
confined in a three dimensional rectangular box, it is possible to separate the 
equation into the sum of three independent terms for different Cartesian components 
and to assume that the wavefunction is given by a product form of those for the three 
components. For a three dimensional harmonic oscillator, a similar decomposition 
into each direction is possible. For these systems with multiple degrees of freedom, 
it is often the case that certain eigenstates have the same eigenvalue. These states 
are called degenerate and the number of states with the same eigenvalue is called 
the degeneracy of the eigenvalue. 
Many particle systems in general can be described more conveniently by 
separating the center of mass coordinates and all other relative coordinates. This 
is the case for quantum many particle systems as well. For polyatomic molecules 
consisting of N atoms, the wavefunction representing the three dimensional center 
of mass motion can factor out as a simple free motion if there are no external 
potentials. After subtracting additional two (for linear molecule) or three degrees 
of freedom representing rotation, the Hamiltonian describing the pure vibrational 
motion can be identified. 
Given that the potential energy for the multidimensional vibrational motion 
can be approximated up to the quadratic terms of the vibrational displacements 
around the potential minimum, it is possible to diagonalize the second derivative 
matrix of the potential energy, which is called Hessian matrix, resulting in normal 
vibrational modes. Each of these normal modes can be described as independent 
one dimensional vibrational motion, making it possible to reduce the quantum 
mechanical vibrational motion of polyatomic molecules as independent products 
of those for effectively one dimensional harmonic oscillators. Out of these normal 
modes, those that induce change in the dipole moment are IR active and those that 
induce change in the polarizability are Raman active.

4.3 For an electron confined in a three dimensional box, for which the lengths of 
three sides are 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 nm, calculate the ground state, first excited, and 
second excited energies. Determine the degeneracy for each state. 
Solution 4.3 Let us introduce l = 1.00 nm, and denote the three sides of the box 
as a = l, b = 2l, c = 3l. Let us also denote the mass of electron as me = 9.109 ×
10−31 kg. Then, the energy eigenvalue of the electron in the three dimensional box 
is given by the following expression:

2 · 9.109 × 10−31 · (1.00 × 10−9)2 J = 6.02 × 10−20 J.
Combining this value with the table, we find that Eg = 8.19 × 10−20J = 0.511 eV, 
Eex−1 = 10.20×10−20 J = 0.637 eV, and Eex−2 = 12.71×10−20 J = 0.7933 eV. 
None of these three states is degenerate. So, the degeneracy of each state is 1. 
4.4 For an electron confined in a three dimensional box, for which two sides have 
the same length of 1.00 nm, and the remaining side has 2.00 nm, calculate the

2 1 1 4 + 1 + 1/4 = 21/4 
1 2 1 1 + 4 + 1/4 = 21/4 
Therefore, Eg = 13.5×10−20 J = 0.843 eV, Eex−1 = 18.1×10−20 J = 1.13 eV, 
and Eex−2 = 25.6 × 10−20 J = 1.60 eV. None of these three states is degenerate. 
So, the degeneracy of each state of the three states is 1. As can be seen from the 
table above, the degeneracy appears in the third excited state.

4.6 For each of the molecule, determine the number of vibrational degrees of 
freedom, and draw pictures of all IR inactive modes.Exercise Problems with Solutions 127

(b) Acetylene (C2H2, linear form in the ground state) 
(c) Phosphine (PH3) 
(d) Cyclopropenylidene (C3H2) 
Solution 4.6 Answers (except for the pictures of IR active modes) for each case are 
provided below. 
(a) This is a linear molecular. Therefore, there are 9 − 5 = 4 vibrational modes. 
There are no IR inactive modes. In other words, all vibrational modes are IR 
active. This is because all vibrational normal modes change the dipole moments 
of the molecule in one way or the other. 
(b) This is a linear molecule. Therefore, there are 12 − 5 = 7 vibrational modes. 
Out of these, there are two symmetric stretching vibrational modes, which are 
IR inactive. 
(c) This is a nonlinear molecule. Therefore, there are 12−6 = 6 vibrational modes. 
There are no IR inactive modes. In other words, all vibrational modes change 
dipole moments and are IR active. 
(d) There are 15 − 6 = 9 vibrational modes. All vibrational normal modes change 
the dipole moment of the molecule. Therefore, there are no IR inactive modes. 
4.7 A molecule has three vibrational degrees of freedom, and thus its vibration 
involves three mass-weighted vibrational coordinates q1, q2, and q3. The vibrational 
potential energy is zero for q1 = q2 = q3 = 0 and the potential energy can be 
expressed as a quadratic function of these coordinates. The mass-weighted Hessian 
matrix for these coordinates is given by

frequencies are ω/√2, ω, and ω

Rotational States and Spectroscopy 
What we observe is not nature itself but nature exposed to our 
method of questioning. 
– Werner Heisenberg 
Abstract This chapter describes rotational motion in two and three dimensions and 
solutions of time independent Schrödinger equations for corresponding rotational 
Hamiltonians. Detailed description of coordinate transformation is provided. It 
is shown that the periodic nature of rotational motion and the requirement that 
wavefunctions are uniquely determined and remain bounded leads to quantization 
of rotational energies. Well known spherical harmonics are shown to be eigen￾functions of angular momentum operators as well as three dimensional rotational 
Hamiltonian. These solutions are then used for the description of rotational motion 
of diatomic molecules as free rigid rotors. Important principles concerning pure 
rotational transitions and those accompanying vibrational transitions are explained. 
Corrections for rigid rotor states, incorporating the effects of centrifugal distortion 
and ro-vibrational coupling, are provided as well. 
Rotation is intrinsically periodic motion along a curved and closed loop in space, 
and can be described best in coordinate systems different from Cartesian coordi￾nates. In two dimensions, this can be done by introducing an angle variable in polar 
coordinate system. In three dimension, it takes consideration of two angle variables 
in the spherical coordinate system.

5.1 Rotation in Two Dimensional Space 
Let us consider a classical particle that moves with constant speed on a circle of 
radius r centered at origin in a two dimensional xy-plane as shown in Fig. 5.1. The 
classical Hamiltonian for such a motion is 
HR = p2
2m




r=
√x2+y2
= 1
2m(p2
x + p2
y )




r=
√x2+y2
, (5.1) 
where r = 
x2 + y2 in the subscript implies that it remains constant throughout 
the motion. Without this constraint, the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator 
corresponding to the above classical Hamiltonian is 
Hˆf = 1
2m

pˆ
2
x + ˆp2
y

, (5.2) 
which is in fact the Hamiltonian for free motion as the subscript f indicates. In order 
to represent the rotational motion, it should be possible to impose the constraint of 
fixed r = 
x2 + y2. For the specification of this constraint, it is important to use 
an appropriate coordinate system as will become clear below. 
Let us first denote the quantum mechanical rotational Hamiltonian as HˆR and 
start with the time independent Schrödinger equation in the Dirac notation. 
HˆR|ψ = ER|ψ. (5.3) 
The position representation of this is obtained by taking the inner product with 
x, y|≡x|⊗y|, the bra representing the state with cartesian coordinates x and y.

, (5.4) 
where ER is the eigenvalue for the rotational energy to be determined. 
Equation (5.4) appears to be complicated due to the constraint. However, convert￾ing (x, y) to polar coordinates simplifies the mathematical problem significantly. 
Let us consider polar coordinates in the two dimensional plane, (r, φ), which are 
defined by 
r =

x2 + y2, (5.5) 
tan φ = y
x
. (5.6) 
Given the above values, any cartesian coordinates can be determined by x = r cos φ
and y = r sin φ. 
Employing the chain rule for differentiation, the partial derivatives with respect 
x and y can be related to those of r and φ as follows: 
∂
∂x = ∂r
∂x
∂
∂r + ∂φ

∂
∂y = ∂r
∂y
∂
∂r + ∂φ

∂

From Eq. (5.5), we find that 
∂r
∂x = x 
x2 + y2 = x
r = cos φ, (5.9) 
∂r
∂y = y

x2 + y2 = y
r = sin φ. (5.10) 
From Eq. (5.6), we also find that 
sec2 φ ∂φ
∂x = − y
x2 , (5.11) 
sec2 φ ∂φ
∂y = 1 
x
. (5.12)134 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy
Note that sec2 φ = 1 + tan2 φ = r2/x2. Thus, the above identities can be simplified 
to 
∂φ
∂x = − y
r2 = −sin φ
r , (5.13) 
∂φ
∂y = x
r2 = cos φ
r . (5.14) 
Combining Eqs. (5.9), (5.10), (5.13), and (5.14) with Eqs. (5.7) and (5.8), we find 
that 
∂

. (5.17)5.1 Rotation in Two Dimensional Space 135
The separation of differentials involving r and φ in Eq. (5.17) now makes it easy 
to impose constraint of constant r, which simply amounts to assuming that ∂/∂r =
0. Thus, Eq. (5.4) simplifies to 
− h¯

∂2
∂φ2 ψ(x, y)





r=
√x2+y2
= ERψ(x, y)|
r=
√x2+y2 . (5.18) 
Now, let us define 
ψr(φ) = ψ(x, y)|
r=
√x2+y2 , (5.19) 
and introduce I = mr2, which is the moment of inertia for the rotational motion. 
Then, Eq. (5.18) becomes 
− h¯
2
2I
∂2
∂φ2 ψr(φ) = ERψr(φ). (5.20) 
A general solution of the above equation can be expressed as 
ψr(φ) = Neimφ, (5.21) 
which results in the following relationship: 
− h¯
2
2I
∂2
∂φ2 ψr(φ) = h¯
2m2
2I ψr(φ) = ERψr(φ). (5.22) 
Equation (5.20) represents free motion along the φ coordinate. However, there is 
major difference of this rotational motion from that in infinite space. For the former, 
the domain of φ representing different physical space is confined only to a range of 
2π. In other words, the periodic boundary condition, ψr(φ) = ψr(φ + 2π ), should 
be satisfied. This condition implies that 
eim2π = 1, (5.23) 
which can be satisfied only for integer values of m = 0, ±1, ±2, ··· . Therefore, we 
obtain the following expression: 
Eigenvalue of Two-Dimensional Rotation 
ER,m = h¯
2m2
2I , m = 0, ±1, ±2, ··· . (5.24)136 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy
The normalization constant of the rotational wavefunction in Eq. (5.21) can be 
determined using the following condition: 
	 2π

dφ|ψr(φ)|
2 = |N|
22π = 1. (5.25) 
A choice of N = 1/
√2π satisfies the above condition. Thus, the normalized 
eigenfunction of the 2-dimensional rotation with eigenvalue mh¯ can be expressed 
as follows:

5.2 Rotation in Three Dimensional Space 
The approach of obtaining rotational kinetic energy term directly from the Cartesian 
coordinate system for two-dimension can also be used for rotation in three dimen￾sional space. For this, the spherical coordinate system, (r, θ , φ) (see Fig. 5.2), need 
to be used. This will be demonstrated in detail in the next section, when we describe 
angular momentum operators. 
Fig. 5.2 Illustration of 
spherical coordinates (r, θ , φ)5.2 Rotation in Three Dimensional Space 137
Here, let us use a well-established formula for converting the Laplacian (∇2) in 
the Cartesian coordinate system to that in a curvilinear coordinate system, where 
coordinates are defined along a system of three curved lines that remain orthogonal 
at each point. First, this can be illustrated for the two dimensional case given by Eq. 
(5.17). 
For the polar coordinate system specified by (r, φ), the multiplicative factors used 
to convert the change in the values of coordinates to appropriate length units, so 
called the metric factors along r and φ, are respectively defined as hr = 1 and hφ =
r. Then, the Laplacian in the two dimensional space, Eq. (5.17), can be expressed as 
∇2 = ∂2

. (5.27) 
In fact, this is a special case of much more general expression that is valid in 
any dimension. For example, in three dimensional general coordinate system of 
(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) with metric factor along the three directions, h1, h2, and h3, which 
themselves can be considered as functions of ξ1, ξ2, and ξ3, there is a general 
expression [30] for the Laplacian as follows: 
∇2 = ∂2

(5.28) 
In the above expression, (1/hi)(∂/∂ξi) for each of i = 1, 2, 3 corre￾sponds to the component of the mathematical gradient vector operation and 
(1/h1h2h3)(∂/∂ξi)hjhk with j = k = i corresponds to the divergence along 
each direction. 
For the case of cartesian coordinate system, hx = hy = hz = 1, which results 
in the simplest expression for ∇2. However, for spherical coordinates (r, θ , φ) as 
shown in Fig. 5.2, h1 = 1, h2 = r, and h3 = r sin θ. Therefore, 
∇2 = 1

Combining Eqs. (5.38) and (5.39), we obtain the eigenvalue and eigenfunction of

J (θ , φ) form a complete orthonormal basis 
for any well-behaving functions depending on θ and φ. Namely, any function of θ
and φ can be expressed as a linear combination of these as follows: 
f (θ , φ) = 
J,m

J (θ , φ), (5.48) 
where CJ,m’s can be determined uniquely using Eq. (5.47). 
5.3 Angular Momentum Operators 
Each of the spherical harmonics introduced in the previous section is an eigenfunc￾tion of the rotational part of the kinetic energy operator. In classical mechanics, such 
rotational energy can be expressed in terms of angular momentum. For example, 
consider a particle with mass m rotating with a constant speed v at a fixed distance144 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy
r from the origin. By introducing L = mrv, the kinetic energy of this particle can 
be expressed as 
mv2
2 = L2
2mr2 = L2
2I
. (5.49) 
In fact, the last expression for the rotational kinetic energy in the above equation is 
much more general and can be shown to be true if it is defined as the magnitude of 
the following angular momentum vector: 
L = r × p = Lx ex + Ly ey + Lzez
= (ypz − zpy )ex + (zpx − xpz)ey + (xpy − ypx )ez. (5.50) 
The square of the magnitude of this vector can be shown to be 
|L|
2 = L2
x + L2
y + L2
z = r2p2
⊥, (5.51) 
where p⊥ is the projection of a momentum p vector to a plane perpendicular to r. 
In other words, classically, kinetic energy can be decomposed as 
T = |p|
2
2m = p2
 + p2

2m = p2

2m + r2p2

2mr2 = p2

2m +
L2
2I
, (5.52) 
where p is the component of the momentum along the direction of r. Thus, 
T can always be considered as the sum of the kinetic energy for a linear one￾dimensional motion along the direction of r and rotational kinetic energy, which 
can be represented by the magnitude of the angular momentum vector L as

possible to define quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator for three dimensional 
rotation as summarized below.

Lˆ x = ˆypˆz − ˆzpˆy , (5.55) 
Lˆ y = ˆzpˆx − ˆxpˆz, (5.56) 
Lˆ z = ˆxpˆy
− ˆypˆx . (5.57) 
The three cartesian components of the angular momentum operators defined 
above do not commute with each other, unlike the linear momentum operators. 
Instead, the following relations hold. 
[Lˆ x ,Lˆ y ] = ih¯Lˆ z, (5.58) 
[Lˆ y ,Lˆ z] = ih¯Lˆ x , (5.59) 
[Lˆ z,Lˆ x ] = ih¯Lˆ y . (5.60) 
It is straightforward to prove the above identities for commutators of angular 
momentum operators using the identity of Eq. (2.57) or calculating the commutator 
directly. For example, 
[Lˆ x ,Lˆ y ] = [ˆypˆz − ˆzpˆy , zˆpˆx − ˆxpˆz]
= [ˆypˆz, zˆpˆx ] − [ˆzpˆy , zˆpˆx ]−[ˆypˆz, xˆpˆz] + [ˆzpˆy , xˆpˆz]
= ˆy[ ˆpz, zˆ] ˆpx + ˆx[ˆz, pˆz] ˆpy
= ih(¯ xˆpˆy
− ˆypˆx ) = ih¯Lˆ z. (5.61) 
On the other hand, using the identities used above once again, one can prove that 
Lˆ 2 commute with individual components, Lˆ x , Lˆ y , and Lˆ z. For example, 
[Lˆ 2,Lˆ z]=[Lˆ 2
x + Lˆ 2
y + Lˆ 2
z ,Lˆ z]
= Lˆ x [Lˆ x ,Lˆ z]+[Lˆ x ,Lˆ z]Lˆ x + Lˆ y [Lˆ y ,Lˆ z]+[Lˆ y ,Lˆ z]Lˆ y
= Lˆ x (−ih¯Lˆ y ) + (−ih¯Lˆ y )Lˆ x + Lˆ y (ih¯Lˆ x ) + (ih¯Lˆ x )Lˆ y = 0. (5.62)146 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy

In order to express these in terms of spherical coordinates, let us now consider 
conversion of Cartesian coordinates into spherical coordinates in more detail. First, 
the Cartesian components can be expressed in terms of spherical coordinates as 
follows: 
x = r sin θ cos φ, (5.66) 
y = r sin θ sin φ, (5.67) 
z = r cos θ. (5.68) 
From these, one can also obtain expressions for spherical coordinates in terms of 
Cartesian coordinates as follows: 
r =

x2 + y2 + z2, (5.69) 
tan θ =

x2 + y2 
z , (5.70) 
tan φ = y
x
. (5.71) 
The above expression can be used to obtain the following relations between partial 
derivatives with respect to Cartesian coordinates and those with respect to spherical 
coordinates. First, the partial derivatives of r are expressed as 
∂r
∂x = x 
x2 + y2 + z2 = r sin θ cos φ
r = sin θ cos φ, (5.72) 
∂r
∂y = y

x2 + y2 + z2 = r sin θ sin φ
r = sin θ sin φ, (5.73) 
∂r
∂z = z

x2 + y2 + z2 = r cos θ
r = cos θ. (5.74)5.3 Angular Momentum Operators 147
The partial derivatives of θ, which can be obtained from the fact that d tan θ =
sec2 θdθ, are given by 
∂θ
∂x = cos2 θ r sin θ cos φ
r sin θ r cos θ = cos θ cos φ

Finally, the partial derivatives of φ, which can be obtained from the fact that 
d tan φ = sec2 φdφ, can be expressed as 
∂φ
∂x = − cos2 φ r sin θ sin φ
r2 sin2 θ cos2 φ = − sin φ

∂y = cos2 φ

r sin θ cos φ = cos φ

The above expressions can be used to convert the partial derivatives with respect to 
x, y, and z to those with respect to r, θ, and φ. The resulting expressions can then 
be used to obtain expressions for the components of angular momentum operator. 
The expression for the angular momentum along the z-coordinate has the 
simplest form and can be shown to be

Considering the position state in spherical coordinate system, one can express r| as

The position ket |r can also be written in a similar way. Note that the ranges of these 
spherical coordinate variables are different from those of cartesian coordinates, and148 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy
are given by 0 ≤ r, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, and 0 ≤ φ < 2π. Employing Eq. (5.82) in Eq. (5.81) 
and using the fact that r| and θ| remain invariant after application of Lˆ z, we find 
that Eq. (5.81) is equivalent to the following expression:

Note that this is the same as that representing the rotational kinetic energy except 
for the factor of 1/(2I ). Therefore, Y m
J (θ , φ) is an eigenfunction of the above 
differential equation as well. Thus, the spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of 
squared angular momentum operator as summarized below. 
Rotational Eigenstates and Eigenvalues 
Let us define |J,m such that 
Y m
J (θ , φ) = θ,φ|J,m. (5.89) 
Then, Eqs. (5.44) and (5.45) imply that

Lˆ z|J, m = hm¯ |J, m, (5.91) 
where J = 0, 1, 2, ··· and m are integers such that |m| ≤ J . Note that the 
reason why |J,m can be a simultaneous eigenstate of Lˆ 2 and Lˆ z is because 
the two commute with each other. 
So far, we have considered rotation of a particle around origin. In fact, the same 
approach can be used to describe the rotation of a diatomic molecule around its 
center of mass. For this, let us consider the Hamiltonian operator for the two particle 
system, Eq. (4.83), in the absence of an external potential and removing the kinetic 
energy term for the center of mass. Thus, let us consider the following Hamiltonian 
operator: 
Hˆrel = pˆ 2
2μ
+ Vrel(r), ˆ (5.92) 
where μ = m1m2/(m1 + m2) is the reduced mass and the fact that the potential 
energy is a function of r only has been used. Applying this operator on the position

In the second equality of the above equation, the first component involving deriva￾tives of r represents vibration motion along the internuclear direction, whereas the 
second part represents a rotational motion. Note that this part is the same as the 
rotational Hamiltonian for a particle with effective mass μ. Thus, all the results 
provided so far for three dimensional rotation of a particle around origin can also be 
used to describe the quantum states representing the rotation of a diatomic molecule 
around its center of mass given that the following expression is used for the moment 
of inertia: 
I = μr2. (5.94) 
5.4 Spectroscopy of Rotational Transitions for Diatomic 
Molecules 
We will consider three major transitions involving rotational motions of diatomic 
molecules. The first is pure rotational transition normally known as microwave 
spectroscopy. The second is rotational Raman spectroscopy. Finally, we will con￾sider ro-vibrational transitions, where rotational transitions accompany vibrational 
transitions. 
5.4.1 Microwave Spectroscopy 
Microwave spectroscopy in general refers to the detection of transitions of rotational 
states due to linear interaction of the molecular dipole with the electric field 
component of light. The reason why this is called “microwave” is because the 
energy level spacings involved are typically in the microwave region. The transition 
in rotational states occurs because the dipole operator, if not zero, does not commute 
with the rotational Hamiltonian. Selection rules for this can be understood by 
considering how different rotational states are coupled by the dipole operator.5.4 Spectroscopy of Rotational Transitions for Diatomic Molecules 151
Selection Rules for Microwave Spectroscopy of Diatomic Molecules
• If a molecule does not have a permanent dipole, light cannot distinguish 
different rotational state at the level of the first order interaction. Thus, 
an important gross selection rule for microwave spectroscopy is that the 
molecule has to be polar to be microwave active.
• The rotational property of the permanent dipole moment, which is pro￾portional to the internuclear distance vector, has the same symmetry 
property as a three dimensional position vector. Employing the properties 
of spherical harmonics, it is possible to show that such dipole operator 
can couple only neighboring rotational quantum numbers. In other words, 
the following selection rule applies for the microwave spectroscopy of 
diatomic molecules: 
J = ±1. (5.95) 
Microwave spectroscopy is commonly described in terms of rotational constant 
B defined by the following relationship: 
EJ = h¯
2
2I
J (J + 1) = BJ (J + 1), (5.96) 
where the second equality serves as the definition of B. Typically, the rotational 
energy is reported in the unit of wavenumber (cm−1) and the following rotational 
term is often used: 
G(J ) = EJ
hc = h¯
2
2I hc J (J + 1) = BJ (J ˜ + 1). (5.97) 
The microwave spectroscopy is in general absorption spectroscopy. Thus, the 
transition involved is J → J + 1, for which the energy difference is given by 
E = B(J + 1)(J + 2) − BJ (J + 1) = 2B(J + 1). (5.98) 
The corresponding wavenumber is given by 
ν˜ = E
hc = 2B(J ˜ + 1). (5.99) 
As Eq. (5.98) or (5.99) shows, the rotational transition energy or wavenumber 
increases linearly with the initial total angular momentum quantum number J . This 
is in contrast to the vibrational transition of a harmonic oscillator where there is152 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy
only one transition energy, within the harmonic oscillator approximation. For this 
reason, the microwave spectroscopy appears as a packet of transition lines rather 
than a single or few transitions. 
Since the interaction strength between the dipole and the electric field does not 
change significantly with the rotational state of the molecule, the intensity of each 
rotational transition is proportional to the relative population of molecule in the 
specific initial rotational state with quantum number J . For a given rotational state 
with J , there are 2J + 1 degenerate states because any of mJ = −J, ··· , J is 
possible. In other words, a given angular momentum quantum number J has 2J +
1 degeneracy. Therefore, the probability of having the molecule in the J state is 
proportional to this degeneracy multiplied by the Boltzmann factor as follows:

(2J + 1) exp 
−BJ (J+1)
kBT

∞
J=0(2J + 1) exp 
−BJ (J+1)
kBT
. (5.100) 
5.4.2 Rotational Raman Spectroscopy 
Rotational Raman spectroscopy probes transition of rotational states due to the 
interaction of the polarizability of a molecule with light, which is second order with 
respect to the electric field amplitude of the light. Selection rules for the rotational 
Raman spectroscopy can be understood considering this aspect. 
Selection Rules for Rotational Raman Spectroscopy
• Any molecule that changes its polarizability with rotation is active in the 
rotational Raman spectroscopy. This means that the molecule should have 
anisotropic polarizability, which is always the case for diatomic molecules.
• Since polarizability is independent of the sign of rotation, it is easy to 
see that it is an even function of angles and is invariant after rotation 
by 180o degrees. This symmetry property makes the selection rule for 
rotational Raman different from the microwave spectroscopy and results 
in the following selection rule: 
J = ±2. (5.101)
• The positive case is Stokes Raman transition and the negative case is anti￾Stokes Raman transition. For the Stokes Raman transition from J to J +2, 
the magnitude of the transition energy (in wave number) is 
ν˜ = B˜ {(J + 2)(J + 3) − J (J + 1)} = 2B(˜ 2J + 3). (5.102)5.4 Spectroscopy of Rotational Transitions for Diatomic Molecules 153
5.4.3 Ro-Vibrational Transition 
For the understanding of ro-vibrational transition, it is necessary to consider the 
diatomic molecular Hamiltonian given by Eq. (5.92) in more detail. For |ψE, an 
eigenstate of this Hamiltonian with eigenvalue E, applying the Hamiltonian for the 
relative motion part and then taking inner product with the position bra, we find that

Let re be the equilibrium internuclear distance of the diatomic molecule. If the 
internuclear potential energy is strong enough, the deviation, s = r − re, is very 
small compared to re. Indeed, this is the case for most diatomic molecules consisting 
of light atoms. Then, the moment of inertia in this case can be approximated as 
I = μr2 ≈ μr2
e in the above equation and 
V eff
J (r) ≈ Vrel(r) + BeJ (J + 1), (5.107) 
where Be = h¯
2/(2Ie) = h¯
2/(2μr2
e ). Let us also assume that Vrel(r) can be 
approximated as a parabolic potential around re with curvature V 
rel(re) = μω2. 
Thus Vrel(r) ≈ Vrel(re) + μω2
e (r − re)2/2. Then, Eq. (5.108) can be approximated 
as154 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy

ψv(re + s) = Eψv(re + s),
(5.108) 
where we have introduced a new coordinate s = r − re. 
Equation (5.108) is the same as the Schrödinger equation for the harmonic 
oscillator except for the constant terms and the addition of rotational energy, which 
is independent of r. Therefore, the corresponding eigenfunction is the same as that 
for the harmonic oscillator as follows: 
ψv(re + s) = Nve−γ s2/2Hv(
√γ s), (5.109) 
where γ = √μωe/h¯, Nv is the normalization constant, and Hv(
√γ s) is the Hermite 
polynomial. On the other hand, the eigenvalue is 
Ev,J = hω¯ e

v +

2

+ BeJ (J + 1) + Vrel(re). (5.110) 
The above expression shows that the eigenstate of a diatomic molecule, in its 
simplest approximation of I ≈ Ie, can be viewed as the direct product of the 
vibrational and rotational states, namely, |v⊗|J,m. Now, note that the dipole 
vector is given by 
D = qr = q(re + s) 
ex sin θ cos φ + ey sin θ sin φ + ez cos θ

, (5.111) 
where q is the partial nuclear charge of the diatomic molecule and ex , ey , and ez are 
unit vectors along x, y, and z coordinates. Thus, the measurement of dipole moment 
in fact involves measuring both the internuclear distance and angle of the molecule. 
If the energy of light is small enough not to excite any vibrational motion, it is 
possible that only rotational states are altered. This is the case of the microwave 
spectroscopy. However, for the case of IR spectroscopy that involves transition of 
vibrational energies, it is inevitable that rotational states change as well because the 
energy for rotational energy is readily available and there is nothing that prevents 
the rotational transition from accompanying the vibrational transition. The selection 
rule governing the rotational transition in this case is the same as the microwave 
spectroscopy because the same dipole operator is involved. Since wavenumber 
is used for the description of these ro-vibrational transitions, it is convenient to 
introduce the corresponding ro-vibrational term as follows: 
G(v, J ) = Ev,J
hc
= ˜νe(v +
1
2
) + B˜eJ (J + 1). (5.112)5.4 Spectroscopy of Rotational Transitions for Diatomic Molecules 155
Selection Rules for RO-Vibrational Transitions and P, Q, and R Branches
• Due to the availability of rotational transition during vibrational transition 
as noted above, in any IR spectroscopy, not only the vibrational quantum 
number changes according to Δv = 1 but the rotational quantum number J
also changes in general. For the case of most diatomic molecules,1 J =
±1.
• The transitions corresponding to J = −1 form the P-branch and have 
the following wavenumbers: 
ν˜P (J ) = ˜νe + B˜e(J − 1)J − B˜eJ (J + 1) = ˜νe − 2B˜eJ. (5.113)
• The transitions corresponding to J = 1 form the R-branch and have the 
following wavenumbers: 
ν˜R(J ) = ˜νe+B˜e(J+1)(J+2)−B˜eJ (J+1) = ˜νe+2B˜e(J+1). (5.114)
• The transitions corresponding to J = 0, which is normally forbidden, 
form the Q-branch and the corresponding wavenumber is ν˜e. 
1 There are few exceptions for this such as the molecule NO, for which J = 0 is also 
possible. Such exception occurs due to the special nature of the electronic states that 
contributes to the angular momentum. 
The above selection rules are based on the approximation that the vibrational and 
rotational motion are decoupled from each other and that there are no centrifugal 
distortion. Complications that arise when these are included are described in the 
next subsection. 
5.4.4 Centrifugal Correction and Ro-Vibrational Coupling 
In actual diatomic molecules, corrections need to be made for the distortion of 
bond distance due to centrifugal distortion and the coupling between vibration and 
rotation. As long as such effects are small, they can be added as small corrections. 
For this, let us expand Vrel(r) and h¯
2J (J+1)/r2 in Eq. (5.106) around re as follows:156 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy

2. (5.129)158 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy
The first term in the above correction term comes from the coupling between the 
vibration and rotation and the second term comes from the centrifugal distortion. 
Note that both terms reduce the rotational energy level spacings because they 
effectively increase the moment of inertia. 
Let us first consider the case of rotational states for vibrational ground state, 
v = 0. The rotational energy level (without including the constant term) is given by 
EJ = B0J (J + 1) − DeJ 2(J + 1)
2, (5.130) 
where 
B0 = Be − αe
2 . (5.131) 
The corresponding rotational energy term is as follows: 
G(J ) = B˜0J (J + 1) − D˜ eJ 2(J + 1)
2, (5.132) 
where B˜0 = B0/(hc) and D˜ e = De/(hc). With this expression, the correction for 
the rotational transition wavenumber, for the case of J → J + 1, can be shown to 
be 
ν(J ˜ → J + 1) = B˜0(J + 1)(J + 2) − D˜ e(J + 1)
2(J + 2)
2
−B˜0J (J + 1) + D˜ eJ 2(J + 1)
2
= 2B˜0(J + 1) − D˜ e(J + 1)
2(4J + 4)
= 2B˜0(J + 1) − 4D˜ e(J + 1)
3. (5.133) 
Note that the reduction of the level spacing due to the centrifugal distortion depends 
on the third order of (J + 1). 
Next, let us consider the effects of the coupling of rotational and vibrational 
states, but without including the effects of the centrifugal distortion. The corre￾sponding term for the state in this case is given by 
G(v, J ) = ˜νe(v +
1
2
) + B˜vJ (J + 1), (5.134) 
where 
B˜v = B˜e − ˜αe(v +
1
2
), (5.135) 
with α˜ e = αe/(hc). The above expression implies that the rotational constant 
decreases as the vibrational quantum number increases. This is because larger 
vibrational quantum number results in larger moment of inertia. Note that the 
rotational constant is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia. Given the5.5 Summary and Questions 159
above term, the P-branch, assuming that the vibrational transition is v = 0 → 1, 
now has the following expression: 
ν˜P (J ) = ˜νe + B˜1J (J − 1) − B˜0J (J + 1)
= ˜νe + (B˜1 − B˜0)J 2 − (B˜1 + B˜0)J
= ˜νe − ˜αeJ 2 − 2(B˜e − ˜αe)J. (5.136) 
This P-branch has lower energy than the original pure vibrational transition, with 
the red shift increasing (becoming more negative) as J increases. The level spacing 
of this P-branch between consecutive values of J increases as J increases. On the 
other hand, the R-branch has the following expression: 
ν˜R(J ) = ˜νe + B˜1(J + 1)(J + 2) − B˜0J (J + 1)
= ˜νe + (B˜1 − B˜0)J 2 + (3B˜1 − B˜0)J + 2B˜1
= ˜νe − ˜αeJ 2 + (2B˜e − 4α˜ e)J + 2B˜e − 3α˜ e. (5.137) 
This R-branch has higher energy than the original vibrational transition (J = 0), 
and shows blue shift (at least for small values of J ) as J increases. However, 
the difference of transition energies between consecutive values of J within this 
R-branch decreases as J increases. For sufficiently large value of J , the above 
expression predicts that ν˜R(J ) decreases as J increases. This is called “reversal 
of R-head” [31]. 
5.5 Summary and Questions 
Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of two dimensional rotation (or rotation around 
the z-axis) are given by Eqs. (5.24) and (5.26), respectively. For three dimensional 
rotation, separation of variables in spherical coordinate system leads to an equation 
for the axial angle θ, the solution of which is related to associated Legendre 
functions provided in Table 5.1. Combination of these with eigenfunctions for 
the two-dimensional rotation results in spherical harmonics defined by Eq. (5.42) 
as eigenfunctions for the three dimensional rotation with eigenvalues given by 
Eq. (5.43). 
Alternatively, three dimensional rotational Hamiltonian can be expressed in 
terms of the angular momentum square operator as shown in Eq. (5.54). Spherical 
harmonics are simultaneous eigenfunctions of the angular momentum square 
operator and the z-component of the angular momentum operator, and serve as 
a complete basis for describing any three dimensional rotational motion. This is 
also related with the fact that three different cartesian components of the angular 
momentum operators do not commute with each other, as shown in Eqs. (5.58)– 
(5.60), making it impossible to specify more than one of them.160 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy
The rotational spectroscopy of diatomic molecules, which are approximated as 
rigid rotors, can be fully described in terms of the interaction of dipole operator 
or polarization operator associated with the rotation and electric fields. Microwave 
spectroscopy involves interaction with the dipole operator, for which the selection 
rule is given by Eq. (5.95). Rotational Raman spectroscopy involves interaction with 
the polarization operator, for which the selection rule is given by Eq. (5.101). It 
is also important to note that change of rotational states accompany vibrational 
transition in general, typically resulting in two major branches called P and R, as 
expressed respectively by Eqs. (5.136) and (5.137). It has long been an experimental 
convention to express all of rotational transition energies in the unit of wavenumber, 
cm−1, for which rotational constants serve as a natural unit of energy. 
For flexible molecules or for molecules in highly excited rotational states, 
the assumption of rigid rotor breaks down. Inclusion of the effect of centrifugal 
distortion is possible by adding corrections for each rotational level as long as 
its effect remains small. Combining this with the change of moment of inertia 
associated with different vibrational level, it is possible to obtain an approximate 
expression for the ro-vibrational level as shown in Eq. (5.128). This expression 
provides more satisfactory description of ro-vibrational transitions of many diatomic 
molecules.

+ β(θ ) = 0, (5.138) 
which is called Legendre equation (with appropriate choice of β as will be clear

Eq. (5.138) can be expressed as

Let us assume that f (x) can be expressed as the following power series: 
f (x) = ∞
k=0
Ckxk+p, (5.140) 
where p is the order of the first term and has to be determined by solving the 
equation. Taking the derivative of f (x) and multiplying with (1 − x2), and then 
taking derivative again, we obtain

{Ck+2(k + p + 2)(k + p + 1)
−Ck(k + p)(k + p + 1)} xk+p.
(5.141) 
Combining this with Eq. (5.140) in Eq. (5.139), we obtain 
C0p(p − 1)xp−2 + C1(p + 1)pxp−1
+ ∞
k=0
{Ck+2(k + p + 2)(k + p + 1) − Ck(k + p)(k + p + 1) + Ckβ} xk+p = 0.
(5.142)162 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy
The first two terms are zero if p = 0, for which one can assume either C0 = 0 or 
C1 = 0. The choice of p = 1 with C1 = 0 or p = −1 with C0 = 0 is equivalent to 
one of these cases. Thus, without losing any generality, we can assume that p = 0. 
For Eq. (5.142) to be satisfied, each coefficient for xk should be zero. This means 
that 
Ck+2 = k(k + 1) − β
(k + 2)(k + 1)
Ck. (5.143) 
Now let us consider the large k limit, for which Ck+2 ∼ Ck. This means that, as x
approaches ±1, f (x) ∼ 1/(1−x2) if C1 = 0 and f (x) ∼ x/(1−x2) if C0 = 0. The 
resulting wavefunction in this case is not normalizable. Therefore, for the solution 
to be physically acceptable, the series has to terminate at finite order of x. Thus, let 
us assume that the series terminate at xJ . This is possible if 
β = J (J + 1), (5.144) 
where J = 0, 1, ··· . The resulting solution of Eq. (5.139) for each case of J is 
called Legendre polynomial of order J and is denoted as PJ (x). 
Let us now consider the case where m = 0 in Eq. (5.37) for β given by 
Eq. (5.144). Employing the same x = cos θ as variable, it can be expressed as

f (x) = 0. (5.145) 
Note that the additional term −m2/(1 − x2) multiplied to f (x) becomes singular 
for x = ±1, for which, θ = 0, π. This singular term has to be taken care of before 
assuming power series for the solution. This can be achieved by introducing another 
function g(x) such that 
f (x) = (1 − x2)
|m|/2g(x). (5.146) 
Why the above form removes the singularity can be understood considering the 
leading contribution from the second derivative of f (x), as detailed below. Taking 
the derivative of Eq. (5.146) with respect to x and multiplying it with (1 − x2), we 
obtain,

Note that the above equation is similar to Eq. (5.139) except for additional first 
derivative term. In fact, g(x) can be related to PJ (x) through derivatives as shown 
below. 
Let us consider the Legendre polynomial PJ (x), which is the solution of the

PJ (x). (5.155) 
Since PJ (x) is a polynomial of order J , the following condition should hold

μD2 = mD/2 = 2.01410 × 1.6605 × 10−27/2 kg = 1.6722 × 10−24 g. Therefore, 
B˜H2 = 59.79 cm−1 and B˜D2 = 29.92 cm−1. With these values, we obtain the 
following values for the energies of three lowest rotational energy levels: 
J = 0 J = 1 J = 2 
H2 0 1.196 × 102 cm−1 3.587 × 102 cm−1 
D2 0 5.984 × 10 cm−1 1.795 × 102 cm−1 
5.6 The equilibrium bond length for H127I is 1.604 × 10−10 m. Calculate the 
three lowest transition energies for the microwave (pure rotational) absorption 
spectroscopy and (ii) the two lowest Stokes Raman transition energies for the 
rotational Raman spectroscopy. 
Solution 5.6 For this diatomic molecule, the reduced mass is given by 
μ = 1.0078 × 126.90
1.0078 + 126.90 × 1.6605 × 10−24 g = 1.6604 × 10−24 g.168 5 Rotational States and Spectroscopy
For this reduced mass and the given internuclear distance, the rotational constant 
becomes B˜ = 6.553 cm−1 = 1.302×10−22 J. Thus, the three microwave absorption 
transition energies are as follows: 
J (0 → 1) : 2B˜ = 13.11 cm−1 = 2.604 × 10−22 J
J (1 → 2) : 4B˜ = 26.21 cm−1 = 5.206 × 10−22 J
J (2 → 3) : 6B˜ = 39.32 cm−1 = 7.810 × 10−22 J
On the other hand, the two Stokes Raman transition energies are as follows: 
J (0 → 2) : 6B˜ = 39.32 cm−1 = 7.810 × 10−22 J
J (1 → 3) : 10B˜ = 65.53 cm−1 = 1.302 × 10−21 J
5.7 For a diatomic molecule AlF, B˜0 = 0.55 cm−1 and D˜ e = 1.05 × 10−6 cm−1. 
Calculate microwave absorption and Stokes Raman transition energies respectively 
for each case that the molecule has initial rotational quantum numbers J = 1 and 
J = 5. 
Solution 5.7 This involves simple application of Eq. (5.132). Thus, the microwave 
absorption transition energies starting from J = 1 and J = 5 are as follows: 
J (1 → 2) : B˜0(6 − 2) − D˜ e(36 − 4) = 4B˜0 − 32D˜ e
= 2.2 cm−1 = 4.37 × 10−23 J
J (5 → 6) : B˜0(42 − 30) − D˜ e(1764 − 900) = 12B˜0 − 864D˜ e
= 6.599 cm−1 = 1.311 × 10−22 J
On the other hand, the Stokes Raman transition energies starting from J = 1 and 
J = 5 are as follows: 
J (1 → 3) : B˜0(12 − 2) − D˜ e(144 − 4) = 10B˜0 − 140D˜ e
= 5.5 cm−1 = 1.09 × 10−23 J
J (5 → 7) : B˜0(56 − 30) − D˜ e(3136 − 900) = 26B˜0 − 2236D˜ e
= 14.298 cm−1 = 2.84 × 10−22 J
5.8 For a diatomic molecule HCl, ν˜e = 2885.9775 cm−1, B˜e = 10.59342 cm−1 
and α˜ e = 0.30718 cm−1 and assume that D˜ e = 0. Then, calculate the transition 
energies (in the unit of wavenumber cm−1) for the first three P-branches and the 
first three R-branches.Problems 169
Solution 5.8 This involves simple applications of Eqs. (5.136) and (5.137). Thus, 
the three P-branches are as follows: 
ν˜P (1) = ˜νe − ˜αe − 2(B˜e − ˜αe)
= ˜νe + ˜αe − 2B˜e = 2865.09784 cm−1,
ν˜P (2) = ˜νe − 4α˜ e − 4(B˜e − ˜αe)
= ˜νe − 4B˜e = 2843.60382 cm−1,
ν˜P (3) = ˜νe − 9α˜ e − 6(B˜e − ˜αe)
= ˜νe − 3α˜ e − 6B˜e = 2821.49544 cm−1.
On the other hand, the three R-branches are as follows: 
ν˜R(0) = ˜νe + 2B˜e − 3α˜ e = 2906.2428 cm−1,
ν˜R(1) = ˜νe − ˜αe + (2B˜e − 4α˜ e) + (2B˜e − 3α˜ e)
= ˜νe + 4B˜e − 8α˜ e = 2925.89374 cm−1,
ν˜R(2) = ˜νe − 4α˜ e + 4B˜e − 8α˜ e + 2B˜e − 3α˜ e
= ˜νe − 15α˜ e + 6B˜e = 2944.93032 cm−1.

Hydrogen-Like Systems and Spin Orbit 
States of an Electron 
When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. 
The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts 
as with creating images. 
— Niels Bohr 
Abstract This chapter provides detailed description of energies, states, and quan￾tum numbers of the state of an electron in hydrogen-like systems, namely, hydrogen 
atom or ions with a single electron. First, Bohr’s model is used for a simple deriva￾tion of energy levels. Then, the complete set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues 
for the Hamiltonian as solutions of the time independent Schrödinger equation 
are provided. In particular, the equation for the radial part of the wavefunction 
and corresponding solutions are described in detail. Spin states of electron are 
then described, which in combination with spatial wavefunctions, namely, orbitals, 
provide full specification of a quantum state of an electron in a hydrogen-like 
system. Effects of a magnetic field on these states and consequences of spin-orbit 
interactions are briefly explained. 
The hydrogen atom or hydrogen-like ion consists of only one nucleus with charge 
Z and an electron. The potential energy between the electron and the nucleus is the 
following Coulomb potential: 
V (r) = − Ze2
4π0r
, (6.1) 
where r = |re − rn|, with re and rn being the positions of the electron and the 
nucleus respectively, e = 1.602176634 × 10−19 C, and 0 = 8.8541878128 ×
10−12 C2/Nm, which is the electric permittivity of vacuum. Before we consider the 
solution of the Schrödinger equation for this potential, let us go over the Bohr’s 
model first.

6.1 Bohr’s Model 
Let us consider an electron, assumed to rotate around the nucleus with charge Z at a 
fixed distance r from the nucleus and with a constant speed v. This is possible only 
if the speed v of the electron is such that the Coulomb force balances the centrifugal 
force, which means that 
Ze2
4π0r2 = mev2
r . (6.2) 
This results in the following relationship between r and v: 
r = Ze2
4π0mev2 = Zmee2
4π0(mev)2 = Zmee2
4π0p2
e
, (6.3) 
where pe = mev is the magnitude of the linear momentum of the electron. 
Information on r also determines the energy of the electron because

4π0r = Ze2
8π0r − Ze2
4π0r = − Ze2
8π0r
. (6.4) 
On the other hand, according to de Broglie, pe is inversely proportional to the 
wavelength of the electron as follows: 
pe = h
λe
. (6.5) 
Having learned the principles and some details of the quantum mechanics and 
wavefunction, we can now view λe as the wavelength of electron’s wavefunction 
defined along its circular trajectory. For the wave not to self-destruct itself along 
the trajectory with a periodic boundary condition, the integer multiples of the 
wavelength have to be equal to the circumference of the orbiting circle as follows: 
nλe = 2π r, n = 1, 2, 3, ··· . (6.6) 
In other words, if the above condition is not satisfied, there is no standing wave that 
is consistent with stable circular motion of the electron. Combining Eq. (6.6) with 
Eq. (6.5), we obtain the following relationship between pe and r. 
pe = hn
2π r = hn¯
r , n = 1, 2, 3, ··· (6.7)6.1 Bohr’s Model 173
Employing this expression in Eqs. (6.3) and (6.4), we find that

, (6.9) 
where n = 1, 2, 3, ··· , and a0 is the value ofrn for Z = 1 and n = 1. The expression 
for a0 is as follows: 
a0 = 4π0h¯
2
mee2 = 0.529 ... Å. (6.10) 
This is an important atomic constant known as the Bohr radius and is approximately 
equal to the size, namely, van der Waals radius, of a hydrogen atom. The constant 
factor, except for charge Z, in Eq. (6.9) is related to another important constant 
known as Rydberg constant given by

As a result, the energy of the electron within the Bohr’s model is expressed as 
En = −R∞hc
Z2
n2 . (6.12) 
Energy levels given above turned out to be fairly accurate and were able to explain 
the electronic spectroscopic data of a hydrogen atom. It is even more amazing that 
Bohr was able to come up with the quantization condition, Eq. (6.6), before de 
Broglie’s theory was proposed. 
Equation (6.12) is based on the assumption that the position of the nucleus is 
fixed, which can be corrected by replacing the mass of an electron with the reduced 
mass for the system. For the case of a hydrogen atom, the reduced mass is μ =
memH /(me + mH ). The resulting Rydberg constant for the electron in hydrogen 
atom is thus given by 
RH = μ
me
R∞ = 1.0968 ···× 105 cm−1. (6.13) 
Therefore, the wavenumber of photons coming out of the (emission) transition 
between different states of the electron, according to the Bohr’s model (with the 
correction of reduced mass), can be expressed as174 6 Hydrogen-Like Systems and Spin Orbit States of an Electron

. (6.14) 
In fact, the above expression, known as Ritz combination principle, had already been 
well established experimentally before Bohr’s model was developed. Specifically, 
the transitions to n1 = 1 from any value of n2 > 1 were known as Lyman series, 
those to n1 = 2 from any value of n2 > 2 Balmer series, and those to n1 =
3 from any value of n2 > 3 Paschen series. Bohr’s model was able to explain 
these observations in a remarkably simple manner by magically combining particle 
and wave properties of the electron as described above. While the idea engrained 
in this Bohr’s model formed the conceptual foundation of quantum mechanics, as 
will become clear, it is important to note that the success of Bohr’s model as an 
accurate theory for energy levels of a hydrogen atom is due to the special nature of 
the Coulomb potential involved. 
6.2 Solution of Schrödinger Equation 
Hydrogen atoms or hydrogen-like ions are examples of two-particle system with 
their relative potential energy given by Eq. (6.1). Therefore, the Hamiltonian for 
their states and energies can be expressed in terms of the Hamiltonian given 
by Eq. (4.79). Let us assume that there is no external potential and that we are 
considering the hydrogen-like system in the center-of-mass coordinate system. 
Then, the Hamiltonian operator becomes 
Hˆ = pˆ 2
2μ
+ V (ˆ r), ˆ (6.15) 
where μ = mnme/(mn +me), with mn being the mass of the nucleus, and pˆ = pˆ e −
pˆ n is the momentum of electron relative to the nucleus. When the above operator is 
applied to the position state represented as a bra in the Dirac notation, we obtain 
r|Hˆ =

− h¯

∇2 + V (r)
ψ(r) = Eψ(r). (6.17)6.3 Separation of Variables in Spherical Coordinate System 175
From now one, for convenience, we will not strictly follow the convention of the 
Dirac notation and often express the first term in the above equation, simply as, 
Hψ( ˆ r), following the original Schrödinger’s definition. 
6.3 Separation of Variables in Spherical Coordinate System

expressed as

Therefore, the Schrödinger equation, Eq. (6.17), in spherical coordinate system is 
expressed as

This has the same form as that for the rotation of a diatomic molecule. However, in 
the present case, it is the angular momentum of (mostly) electron with respect to the 
center of mass, which is almost the same as the position of the nucleus. 
We learned in Chap. 5 that the spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of Lˆ 2. 
Thus, we may be able to simplify Eq. (6.19) by assuming that the eigenfunction can 
be expressed as 
ψ(r, θ , φ) = R(r)Y ml
l (θ , φ). (6.21) 
Note that we have used different labels for the quantum numbers of total angular 
momentum and the z-component angular momentum, l and ml, in order to 
distinguish these from those for molecular rotations. Thus, 
Lˆ 2Y ml
l (θ , φ) = h¯

(6.23) 
The above equation is satisfied for arbitrary value of θ and φ if the equation within 
the square bracket is zero. Dividing the resulting equation with −h¯
2/(2μr), we thus 
obtain the following equation for the radial part of the eigenfunction:

next subsection, we will consider the solution of this equation for the Coulomb 
potential.

To simplify the above equation, let us introduce a scaled and dimensionless radial 
coordinate ρ = αrr, where αr is yet unknown parameter with the unit of inverse 
length. Then, dρ = αrdr. Let us also introduce F (ρ) = R(r). Then, Eq. (6.25) is

where a is a generalization of the Bohr radius. For Z = 1 and μ = me, this becomes 
the Bohr radius a0 defined by Eq. (6.10). Thus, employing this parameter, one can 
express Eq. (6.26) as follows:6.3 Separation of Variables in Spherical Coordinate System 177

Solutions for the above equation can be found by first factoring out a term that 
becomes dominant at large ρ and then expanding the remaining function as a power 
series with respect to ρ. As detailed in the Appendix of this chapter, from the 
recursion relationship between coefficients of the power series expansion, one can 
show that physically well-behaving solutions exist only for the following values of 
the energy:

While the solution of the radial equation provided in Appendix is straightforward, 
for a historical reason, the radial functions have been expressed more commonly in 
terms of associated Laguerre polynomials [23]. Thus, the radial functions are in

6.3.2 Radial Probability Density 
It is important to note that only the information on the radial function is needed to 
calculate the probability density to find the electron at a specific distance from the 
nucleus. The corresponding radial probability density is given by 
Pnl(r) = r2[Rnl(r)]

which satisfies the following normalization condition:

The above equation is satisfied for r = a. In other words, a is the value of the radius 
for which the state with n = 1 and l = 0 has the maximum probability. The radial 
probability can also be used to determine the average potential energy as follows:

(6.41) 
The above result shows that the average potential energy is equal to the value of the 
potential at the most probable value of r, an outcome specific for 1/r dependence 
of the potential energy. This also explains why the simple Bohr’s model, which 
relied on classical-like relationship employing the most probable value of r, was 
successful in reproducing the experimental data. 
6.3.3 Eigenfunctions and Eigenstates in the Dirac Notation 
Combining the radial function with the spherical harmonics, we can now write down 
the full eigenfunction of Hˆ for each eigenvalue. 
Eigenfunctions for a Hydrogen-Like System 
The eigenfunction for the electron in a hydrogen atom or hydrogen-like ion 
with nuclear charge Z is 
ψnlml(r, θ , φ) = Rnl(r)Y ml

(6.45) 
Having identified all the eigenfunctions of Hˆ , it is now convenient to introduce 
the eigenstate in the Dirac notation, |n, l, m, which is defined through the following 
relationship: 
ψnlml(r, θ , φ) = r|n, l, ml. (6.46) 
Since  dr |rr| = 1ˆ, the identity operator, the above definition along with 
Eq. (6.45) implies that 
n
, l
, ml|n, l, ml = δnnδllδmlml . (6.47) 
Employing these, all the results obtained so far can be expressed succinctly in the 
Dirac notation as summarized below. 
Eigenstates in the Dirac Notation 
For the eigenvalue En given by Eq. (6.44), there is an eigenstate |n, l, ml that 
satisfies the following identities: 
Hˆrel|n, l, ml =  pˆ 2
2μ − Ze2
4π0rˆ

|n, l, ml = En|n, l, ml, (6.48) 
Lˆ 2|n, l, ml = h¯
2l(l + 1)|n, l, ml, (6.49) 
Lˆ z|n, l, ml = hm¯ l|n, l, ml, (6.50) 
where l = 0, ··· , n − 1 and ml = −l, ··· , l. 
The fact that [Hˆrel,Lˆ 2] = 0 and [Hˆrel,Lˆ z] = 0 explains why there is a 
simultaneous eigenstate of the three operators, Hˆrel, Lˆ 2, and Lˆ z, which is |n, l, ml
shown above. The set of numbers (n, l, ml) is called good quantum numbers, which 
represent a set of compatible quantum numbers representing conserved quantities. 
In this set, n is called the principal quantum number, l is called the angular182 6 Hydrogen-Like Systems and Spin Orbit States of an Electron
momentum quantum number, and ml is the magnetic quantum number. The value 
of l is also often represented by the symbols shown below.

6.3.4 Zeeman Effect 
In the absence of an external field, all the states with different values of l and ml for 
the same value of n are degenerate. On the other hand, states with different values 
of ml have different values of energy in the presence of a magnetic field, which is 
typically assumed to be in the z-direction. This is called Zeeman effect and is the 
reason why ml is called magnetic quantum number. 
In the presence of a magnetic field, the potential energy of system with magnetic 
moment is given by 
V = −mL · B. (6.51) 
where mL is the magnetic moment vector with its magnitude defined as follows: 
|mL| = Current × Area surrounded by current

For an electron, 
mL = − e

where L is the angular momentum of the electron. Thus, in the presence of a

h¯ BzLz, (6.55) 
where βB = eh/( ¯ 2me) and is called Bohr magneton. Thus, in the presence of the 
magnetic field, the total Hamiltonian is given by 
HˆB = Hˆrel + βB
h¯ BzLˆ z. (6.56) 
Since [Hˆrel,Lˆ z] = 0, the eigenstate of Hˆrel, |n, l, ml still remains the eigenstate of 
HˆB. The only difference is that the eigenvalue now becomes 
En,ml = − h¯
2
2μa2

n2 + βBBzml. (6.57) 
This expression provides quantitative details of the Zeeman effect, and shows that 
the energy splitting is proportional to both ml and Bz. 
6.3.5 Real-Valued Orbital Functions 
As mentioned above, |n, l, ml or ψnlml(r, θ , φ) has the same energy in the absence 
of external field as long as n remains the same. Thanks to this degeneracy, any linear 
combination of Y ml
l (θ , φ) for the same l can serve as simultaneous eigenstate of the 
Hamiltonian Hˆrel and Lˆ 2. Namely, the following linear combination leads to another 
eigenstate of the same eigenvalue.

All of the above functions are orthonormal and are eigenfunctions of Lˆ 2. However, 
except for dz2 , none is the eigenfunction of Lˆ z any more. 
6.4 Spin States 
Imagine a particle circling around a circle of radius r with speed v. Assume that 
r → 0 while |v| ∝ 1/r. In this limit, the particle spins around itself with infinitely 
fast speed, but with finite angular momentum. The angular momentum in this 
limiting case can be called spin. However, one should be careful because this is 
just an analogy. Quantum mechanical spin cannot be visualized like an orbital 
angular momentum wavefunction. On the other hand, it still behaves almost like6.4 Spin States 185
conventional angular momentum with respect to the rotational transformation of the 
space. As a consequence, they satisfy the same commutation relations as angular 
momentum operators. 
Commutation Relations and Eigenvalues of Spin Operators 
The three components of the spin operator satisfy the following commutator 
relations: 
[Sˆ
x , Sˆ
y ] = ih¯Sˆ
z, (6.69) 
[Sˆ
y , Sˆ
z] = ih¯Sˆ
x , (6.70) 
[Sˆ
z, Sˆ
x ] = ih¯Sˆ
y . (6.71) 
Thus, the spin state can be specified in terms of Sˆ2 = Sˆ2
x + Sˆ2
y + Sˆ2
z and Sˆ
z. 
The eigenvalues of these operators are given by S(S + 1) and hm¯ s, where 
S ≥ |ms|. The Dirac notation is very convenient for describing these spin 
states. Namely, the spin eigenstates are defined as follows: 
Sˆ2|S,ms = h¯
2S(S + 1)|S,ms, (6.72) 
Sˆ
z|S, ms = hm¯ s|S, ms. (6.73) 
There are two major differences between the spin and the spatial angular 
momentum as stated below.
• Spin is a unique intrinsic property of a particle like its mass.
• The total spin quantum number S can be half integers as well as full integers. 
Particles with a half integer value of S have properties distinctively different from 
those with a full integer value of S. The former type of particle is called fermion 
(named after Fermi) and the latter is called boson (named after Bose). 
Well known examples of fermions are electron, proton, and neutron, which all 
have S = 1/2. Well known examples of bosons are photon and deuteron, which all 
have S = 1. Fermions cannot share a quantum state, which is specified by the all 
compatible orbital quantum numbers and the spin state. On the other hand, there is 
no limit in the number of bosons that can occupy the same state. Therefore, at zero 
or near zero temperature, bosons tend to occupy the ground state, which is called 
Bose-Einstein condensation. 
Since the spin of an electron is 1/2, it is a fermion and has the following two spin 
states:

where the second equality is an abbreviation typically used because S = 1/2
remains constant for electron. By definition, α|α = 1, β|β = 1, and α|β =
β|α = 0. Combining the above spin states of an electron with those for spatial 
orbitals, we can define the following two states: 

n, l, ml,

= |n, l, ml|β=|n, l, ml⊗|β, (6.77) 
where ⊗ represent the direct product, which amounts to expanding the state space as 
explained in Chap. 2. Note that this kind of direct product is possible between two 
sets of states corresponding to independent variables. Another example of direct 
product is |r=|x⊗|y⊗|z=|x|y|z. As can be seen from these definitions, 
direct product symbols are often omitted unless there is any source of confusion. 
Taking inner products of Eqs. (6.76) and (6.77) with a position state, we also 
obtain


= r|n, l, ml|β = ψnlml(r, θ , φ)|β. (6.79) 
The spin of an electron also interacts with a magnetic field through its magnetic 
moment defined as follows: 
ms = − ge
2me
S, (6.80) 
where g = 2.002319 ... and is called anomalous spin factor. Therefore, in the 
presence of a magnetic field along the z-direction, the potential of the electron is 
V = −(mL + ms) · B = e
2me
(L + gS) · B = βB
h¯ Bz(Lz + gSz). (6.81) 
Therefore, the total Hamiltonian for an electron in a hydrogen-like system subject a 
magnetic field is 
Hˆ = Hˆrel + βB
h¯ Bz(Lˆ z + gSˆ
z). (6.82)6.4 Spin States 187
States given by Eqs. (6.76) and (6.77) (or Eqs. (6.78) and (6.79) in position 
representation) can be shown to be eigenstates of the above Hamiltonian, and the 
corresponding eigenvalues are 
En,ml,ms = − h¯
2
2μa2
0
1
n2 + βBBz(ml + gms). (6.83) 
While the above effect is easy to understand, the fact that electron is in a frame 
that continuously accelerates causes another effect of spin on the energy of the 
electron in hydrogen-like system even when there is no magnetic field. The reason 
is that the electron sees the nucleus as accelerating and therefore experiences the 
magnetic field caused by its motion. This magnetic field then interacts with the spin 
of the electron. Thus, the true Hamiltonian of the electron in a hydrogen-like system 
should be expressed as 
Hˆ = Hˆrel + ξ(r)Lˆ · Sˆ, (6.84) 
where ξ(r) is a function that depends on the distance between the nucleus and the 
electron. Solving the Schrödinger equation for this Hamiltonian is more difficult if 
not impossible. On the other hand, the above form gives insight into what should be 
good quantum numbers when the spin-orbit interaction is included. 
Let us define the sum of the orbital angular momentum and the spin as follows: 
J = L + S. (6.85) 
Then, it is clear that 
L · S = 1
2

(L + S)
2 − L2 − S2


2

J2 − L2 − S2

. (6.86) 
Thus, 
Lˆ · Sˆ = 1
2

Jˆ2 − Lˆ 2 − Sˆ 2

. (6.87) 
Therefore, the spin-orbit coupling can be determined once we know all three 
eigenvalues of Jˆ2, Lˆ 2, and Sˆ 2. For this, let us consider the z-component of Jˆ given 
by 
Jˆ
z = Lˆ z + Sˆ
z. (6.88) 
Since the eigenvalue of Sˆ
z for an electron is ±1/2, the eigenvalue of Jˆ
z is expected 
to be 
jz = ml ±

, (6.89)188 6 Hydrogen-Like Systems and Spin Orbit States of an Electron
where ml = −l, ··· , l. This means that the maximum magnitude of jz is l − 1/2
or l + 1/2 depending on the value of spin. Otherwise, the eigenvalue of Jˆ2 has the 
same structure as Lˆ 2 and Sˆ 2 as follows: 
Jˆ2 → h¯
2j (j + 1), where j = l ±
1
2
. (6.90) 
Note that, for the case where l = 1/2, only j = 1/2 is possible. 
6.5 Electronic Transitions and Term Symbols 
In an electronic transition of a hydrogen-like system due to linear interaction with 
light (single photon transition), the following selection rules apply. 
Selection Rules of Electronic Transitions in Hydrogen-Like Systems 
l = ±1, (6.91)
S = 0, (6.92)
j = 0, ±1 (No 0 → 0 transition). (6.93) 
The orbital angular momentum selection rule, Eq. (6.91), can be understood from 
the fact that (1) the total angular momentum of the electron plus the spin of photon, 
which is equal to one, has to be conserved and (2) that the transition is possible only 
between states with different odd/even symmetry with respect to the inversion of 
the space. This latter rule exists because the interaction with light occurs through 
the dipole operator, which has odd spatial symmetry. Due to this constraint, l = 0
is not possible. 
The spin selection rule, Eq. (6.92), results from the fact that the spin of an electron 
does not interact with the electric field of the radiation. Finally, Eq. (6.93) can be 
understood from the fact that J = L + S. Even though l = 0 is not possible, 
j = 0 can occur through the contribution of the spin having a direction different 
from that of the orbital angular momentum. 
Although this chapter is focused on a hydrogen-like system with only one 
electron, it is useful to introduce here more general term symbols used for describing 
many electron atoms as described below.6.5 Electronic Transitions and Term Symbols 189
Definition of Atomic Term Symbols 
Atomic term symbols provide compact ways to represent the angular momen￾tum, spin, and sum of the two, for electrons in an atom, and are expressed 
as 
2S+1TJ , (6.94) 
where T = S (for L = 0), P (for L = 1), D (for L = 2), . . . . Namely, these are 
capital letters for the symbols used for hydrogen-like orbital functions. The 
left superscript denotes the spin multiplicity 2S + 1, and the right subscript is 
the value of J . 
For a hydrogen-like system, 2S + 1 = 2. Thus, possible electronic term symbols 
for a hydrogen-like system are as follows: 
2S1/2,
2 P1/2,
2 P3/2,
2 D3/2,
2 D5/2, ··· (6.95) 
For the consideration of many-electron systems in the next chapter, it is also 
useful to introduce the general rule of angular momentum addition here. Classically, 
when two angular momenta, L1 and L2, are added to become L = L1+L2, possible 
magnitudes of L are in the following range: 
||L1|−|L2|| ≤ |L|≤|L1|+|L2|. (6.96) 
Quantum mechanically, this condition remains true except that the quantization 
condition has to be satisfied as well. That is, the eigenvalue of Lˆ 2 is as follows: 
Lˆ 2 → h¯
2L(L + 1), L = |L1 − L2|, |L1 − L2| + 1, ··· , L1 + L2 − 1, L1 + L2,
(6.97) 
where L1 is a quantum number for Lˆ 2
1, for which the corresponding eigenvalue is 
h¯
2L1(L1 + 1), and L2 is that for Lˆ 2
2, for which the eigenvalue is hL¯ 2(L2 + 1). 
Because the above identity is related to the symmetry property of the angular 
momentum operator, the same relation holds for spin and the total angular momen￾tum (the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum) as well. Namely, for S =
S1 + S2, 
Sˆ 2 → h¯
2S(S + 1) , with S = |S1 − S2|, ··· , S1 + S2, (6.98)190 6 Hydrogen-Like Systems and Spin Orbit States of an Electron
where S1 and S2 are quantum numbers for Sˆ2
1 and Sˆ2
2 , which respectively have 
eigenvalues h¯
2S1(S1+1) and hS¯ 2(S2+1). The same relation also holds for J = L+S
as follows: 
Jˆ2 → h¯
2J (J + 1) , with J = |L − S|, ··· , L + S, (6.99) 
where L and S are quantum numbers for Lˆ 2 and Sˆ2, which respectively have 
eigenvalues h¯
2L(L + 1) and hS(S ¯ + 1). 
6.6 Summary and Questions 
Quantized energy levels of an electron in a hydrogen-like system, according to 
Bohr’s model, can be explained assuming a classical-like motion of the electron 
orbiting around the nucleus, and requiring only one additional condition. It is to 
assume that the circular orbit of the electron is an integer multiple of its de Broglie 
wavelength, which in turn can be calculated by the value of the momentum that 
maintains the balance between the centrifugal force and the Coulomb attraction by 
the nucleus. The resulting expression is Eq. (6.12), which becomes exact if the mass 
of an electron is replaced with the reduced mass for the system. 
The success of Bohr’s model indicates that the physical origin of the quantized 
energy levels of an electron is the periodic nature of its motion. Bohr’s model 
captures this in the simplest manner by incorporating the duality of a particle￾like property and a wave-like nature of the electron into the requirement of energy 
conservation described in a classical manner. 
For more complete description of the electron, a complete solution of the time 
independent Schrödinger equation is necessary. This becomes possible by using 
a spherical coordinate system and employing the solution for the rotational part, 
the spherical harmonics, to derive an equation for the radial part, Eq. (6.25). This 
equation can be solved exactly, resulting in radial functions shown in Table 6.1 
as examples. A general expression involving Laguerre function and an exponential 
function is given by Eq. (6.32). Combination of this with the spherical harmonics 
results in the full expression for the eigenfunction, Eq. (6.42), for which the 
eigenvalue is given by Eq. (6.44). Alternatively, these can be expressed in the 
Dirac notation as |n, l, ml, which represents a simultaneous eigenstate of the the 
Hamiltonian, the square of the angular momentum, and the z-component of the 
angular momentum according to Eqs. (6.48)–(6.50). 
Because an electron has a spin of magnitude h/¯ 2, for which there can be two spin 
states, up and down, as shown in Eqs. (6.74) and (6.75), a complete specification 
of the quantum state of an electron requires consideration of both the spin and 
spatial orbital states, as shown in Eqs. (6.76) and (6.77). Although many of these 
states are degenerate, having the same energy for the same principal quantum 
number, application of an external magnetic field can easily lift such degeneracy6.6 Summary and Questions 191
since the corresponding eigenvalue is given by Eq. (6.83). At finer scale, it turns out 
that further complications arise due to spin-orbit effects for example. A heuristic 
description of the spin-orbit effects has been provided, which shows that the 
information on the sum of the orbital angular momentum and the spin is needed 
for complete specification of the eigenstate. In fact, the corresponding quantum 
number, normally denoted as J turns out to be important in general and serves as 
an important quantum number for fully specifying many electron states as well as 
a single electron state. The atomic term symbol given by Eq. (6.94) conveys this 
information succinctly. 
Selection rules for electronic transitions involving interaction of an electron with 
one photon are provided by Eqs. (6.91)–(6.93). Term symbols are introduced in 
order to make the description of these electronic transitions in a succinct manner 
and also for the consideration of more general many-electron states that will be 
treated in the next chapter. 
Questions
• Bohr’s model can predict exact energy levels of an electron in a hydrogen￾like system despite its simplicity. How is this possible?
• Energy levels of an electron in a hydrogen-like system are independent 
of the orbital angular momentum quantum number? Why does such 
independence occur despite that the radial equation in fact depends on the 
orbital angular momentum quantum number?
• For eigenfunctions of the electron in a hydrogen-like system, what is the 
sum of the number of radial nodes in the radial function and that of nodal 
planes in the angular part of the eigenfunction? How does it depend on the 
principal quantum number and angular momentum quantum number?
• For a given principal quantum number, does the increase of the orbital 
angular momentum quantum number make the average distance between 
the electron and the nucleus larger or smaller?
• For a given principal quantum number, does the increase of the orbital 
angular momentum quantum number make the probability of finding the 
electron near the nucleus higher or lower?
• What is the common property of the orbital angular momentum and the 
spin of an electron and what are major differences?
• What causes the coupling between the spin and the orbit angular momen￾tum of an electron in a hydrogen-like system?
• In the transition of the electronic energy level in a hydrogen-like system 
due to emission or absorption of one photon, the orbital angular momentum 
quantum number does not remain the same. What is the reason for this?192 6 Hydrogen-Like Systems and Spin Orbit States of an Electron

(6.106)Appendix: Solutions of the Radial Equation 193
From the first term in the above equation, we obtain the following condition for p: 
p(p − 1) − l(l + 1) = (p + l)(p − l − 1) = 0. (6.107) 
Thus, p = −l or l + 1. For nonzero l, the former case results in a function that 
cannot be normalized due to the singularity at r = 0. For l = 0, the solution with 
p = 0 still appears to be possible because it leads to a normalizable wavefunction. 
However, when this function is included as one of the basis function, the resulting 
kinetic energy operator is no longer Hermitian. Therefore, all cases with p = −l
should be excluded and we can use the latter option of p = l + 1 only. 
On the other hand, for the summation in Eq. (6.106) to be zero, the following 
recursion relation has to be satisfied. 
Ck+1 = 2γ (k + p) − 1
(k + p + 1)(k + p) − l(l + 1)
Ck. (6.108) 
Let us first assume that the series do not terminate and Ck’s remain nonzero for all 
k. Then, in the large k limit of k >> l, p, 
Ck+1 ≈ 2γ
(k + 1)
Ck. (6.109) 
This means that G(ρ) ∼ e2γρ for large ρ, which again means that ρF (ρ) ∼ eγρ. 
This is an unphysical solution. Therefore, the series has to terminate at some finite 
order, which is possible as long as the following condition for some k ≥ 0 is 
satisfied. 
γ = 1
2(k + p) = 1
2(k + l + 1)
, k = 0, 1, 2, ··· (6.110) 
In the second equality of the above expression, we have used the fact that p = l +1. 
Now let us introduce 
n = k + l + 1, k = 0, 1, 2, ··· (6.111) 
Then, n ≥ l + 1 and Eq. (6.110) implies that 
γ = 1

Combining this with the definition of γ given by Eq. (6.100), we obtain the 
following expression for the energy:

Approximation Methods for Time 
Independent Schrödinger Equation 
The simplicities of natural laws arise through the complexities 
of the language we use for their expression. 
— Eugene Wigner 
Abstract This chapter is focused on two standard methods of approximating the 
solution of a time independent Schrödinger equation, the variational principle 
and the time independent perturbation theory. The variational principle states that 
the true ground state energy of a quantum system is always smaller than any 
approximation, for which a simple quantum mechanical proof is provided. Then, 
assuming a trial state given by a a linear combination of predetermined basis states, 
which are not necessarily orthogonal, an eigenvalue equation for the coefficients of 
the linear combination and the energy is derived. Solution of this equation results 
in the best choice of the linear combination and the corresponding variational 
approximation for the ground state energy. The perturbation theory is applicable for 
the case where the Hamiltonian of a system is the sum of a zeroth order Hamiltonian 
term with known solutions and a small perturbation term. First, for the case where 
there is no degeneracy in the zeroth order Hamiltonian, general expressions for the 
first and second order corrections for both energies and states are derived. Then, for 
the case where the zeroth order Hamiltonian is degenerate, corrections of the energy 
up to the second order and of the state up to the first order of the perturbation are 
derived. 
Analytic solutions for the time independent Schrödinger equation exist only for very 
few systems. For most cases, one has to resort to either approximation methods or 
numerical solutions. The variational principle and the time independent perturbation 
theory serve as two major methods for such approximation. The objective of this 
chapter is to explain the theoretical bases of these approximation methods and derive 
important expressions that can be employed for actual applications.

203204 7 Approximation Methods for Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
7.1 Variational Principle 
The variational principle provides a general strategy of approximation for a broad 
range of problems. It has long been used widely for solving any kind of eigenvalue 
or optimization problems for the cases where the quantity of interest is bounded. The 
idea behind the variational principle is simple. Let us consider any mathematical 
operator Oˆ defined with respect to a certain set of functions, Sf , and that one can 
identify a set of normalized and orthogonal eigenfunctions φn(x)’s such that any 
function in Sf can be determined as a unique linear combination of φn(x)’s. In 
other words, let us assume that there is a unique expression for any function f (x)
in Sf as follows: 
f (x) = C1φ1(x) + C2φ2(x) +···+ Ckφk(x) +··· . (7.1) 
Then, 

dxf ∗(x)Of (x) ˆ = |C1|
2λ1 + |C2|
2λ2 +···+|Ck|
2λk +··· , (7.2) 
where λk is an eigenvalue for φk(x) such that Oφˆ k(x) = λkφk(x) and the fact that 
 dxφ∗
k (x)φj (x) = δkj has been used. In case all λk’s are real valued and bounded 
from below (or above), it is clear that Eq. (7.2) divided by a proper normalization 
constant should also be bounded the same way. Although functions depending on 
only one variable x were considered above, the same principle holds for any function 
that depends on multiple variables. The Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics 
has all the properties validating these assumptions, which can be utilized for finding 
approximations in case exact solutions are difficult to find. 
7.1.1 General Case 
The most common use of the variational principle in quantum mechanics is 
finding out the approximation for the ground state energy. The underlying theorem, 
employing the Dirac notation, can be stated as follows. 
Theorem 7.1 Consider a system represented by a Hamiltonian operator Hˆ , which 
is Hermitian. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian for any state |φ, which is 
not necessarily normalized, is always bounded from below by its true ground state 
energy Eg as follows: 
Eφ = φ|Hˆ |φ
φ|φ ≥ Eg. (7.3)7.1 Variational Principle 205
Proof Let us denote the complete set of eigenstates of Hˆ as |ψk’s, which are 
normalized. Thus, any state can be represented in terms of linear combination of 
these states as follows: 
|φ = 

2 ≥ Eg, (7.8) 
where the fact that Ek − Eg ≥ 0, which should be satisfied because no eigenvalue 
can be lower than the ground state eigenvalue, has been used. The above equation 
completes the proof of the variational principle. 
The power of the variational principle is the boundedness of Eφ. This guarantees 
that any effort to lower Eφ always results in a better approximation for the true 
ground state energy. It is often the case that the variational principle sometimes 
serves as the last reliable resort in quantum mechanics when finding good enough 
approximations for solutions are extremely difficult. The fact that the choice of the 
state |φ, which is called a trial state, can be chosen without any restriction is also 
a great advantage. However, in practice, it is impossible to search for all possible 
states. Rather, the search is limited to a class of states that can be represented by a 
set of known basis states.206 7 Approximation Methods for Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
7.1.2 Variational Principle for Trial States as Linear 
Combinations of Basis States 
One systematic and mathematically well understood way to construct a trial state is 
to express it as a set of linearly independent states: |f1, ... , |fn. While these are 
independent states, we do not necessarily have to assume that they are orthogonal, 
which significantly expands the choice of basis states one can make. Thus, let us 
assume that the trial state is given by 
|φ = C1|f1 + C2|f2+···+ Cn|fn, (7.9) 
where C1, ... , Cn are unknown constants. The components of a given Hamiltonian 
with respect to these states are denoted as 
Hjk = fj |Hˆ |fk, (7.10) 
and the overlap matrix elements of the basis states are given by 
Sjk = fj |fk. (7.11) 
Then, the statement of the variational principle for the present case reduces to the 
following inequality: 
Eφ = φ|Hˆ |φ

The best approximation of Eφ for Eg can be found by choosing Ck’s minimizing Eφ
given above. A necessary condition for this is that the partial derivative of Eφ with 
respect to Ck’s and C∗
k ’s, which can be viewed as independent complex variables, 
should be zero. Thus, first taking the partial derivative of Eφ with respect to one 
coefficient, for example, for Ci, where i can be any of the indices,

(7.19) 
The above equation is called secular equation. Solving this secular equation, 
one can find n solutions for E. Inserting each value of E into Eq. (7.18) 
and also using the normalization condition, one can find the set of Cj ’s 
corresponding to each solution of E. This completes the solution of Eq. (7.18). 
The lowest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenstate are deemed as the 
best approximations for the ground state energy and the ground eigenstate. 
It is possible [2] to show that all the eigenstates of Eq. (7.18) are orthogonal as 
is explained below. Let us denote the αth eigenvalue as Eα and assume that there 
exists a unique set of coefficients C(α)
j ’s such that 
n
j=1
(Hij − EαSij )C(α)
j = 0, i = 1, ··· , n. (7.20) 
Then, we can define the αth eigenstate as follows: 
|φα = n
j=1
C(α)
j |fj . (7.21) 
Theorem 7.2 Two states |φα and |φβ defined by Eq. (7.21) with coefficients 
satisfying Eq. (7.20) for two different energies Eα 	= Eβ are orthogonal to each 
other. 
Proof First, let us consider the following matrix elements: 
fi|Hˆ |φα = n
j=1
C(α)
j fi|Hˆ |fj  = n
j=1
HijC(α)

C(α)
j fi|fj  = n
j=1 
C(α)
j Sij . (7.23)7.1 Variational Principle 209
Multiplying Eq. (7.23) with Eα, we find that 
Eαfi|φα = n
j=1
EαC(α)
j Sij . (7.24) 
Combining Eqs. (7.22) and (7.24), we find that Eq. (7.20) can be expressed as 
fi|(Hˆ − Eα)|φα = 0, i = 1, ··· , n (7.25) 
Now consider another eigenstate |φβ = C(β)
j |fj , where Eβ 	= Eα. Then, using 
the above identity, it is straightforward to show that 
φβ|(Hˆ − Eα)|φα = n
j=1
C(β)∗
j fj |(Hˆ − Eα)|φα = 0. (7.26) 
In a similar manner, or exchanging α and β, one can also show that 
φα|(Hˆ − Eβ)|φβ = 0. (7.27) 
Subtracting the complex conjugate of Eq. (7.27) from Eq. (7.26) and noting the fact 
that Eα and Eβ are real valued numbers, we then find that 
(Eα − Eβ)φα|φβ = 0. (7.28) 
For Eα 	= Eβ, the above equation proves that φα|φβ=φβ|φα = 0. 
As is clear from the above proof, in case Eα = Eβ, the two states |φα and 
|φβ do not have to be orthogonal to each other. However, even in such case, it 
is still possible to find out two orthogonal states out of the linear combination of 
those states. In this way, it is possible to find a set of orthogonal states satisfying the 
variational principle. 
As a simple example, consider a trial state as a linear combination of two basis 
states as follows: |φ = C1|f1 + C2|f2. In addition, let us assumed that |f1 and 
|f2 are normalized. All the matrix elements are assumed to be real numbers, and 
H11 = H22 = Hd and H12 = H21 = Hc. Then, 
 Hd − E Hc − ES
Hc − ES Hd − E
 C1



where S = f1|f2=f2|f1. For the above equation to be satisfied for nonzero 
values of C1 and C2,

which is equivalent to the following quadratic equation: 
(Hd−E)2−(Hc−ES)2 = (Hd−E+Hc−ES)(Hd−E−Hc+ES) = 0. (7.31) 
The two solutions of the above equation are as follows: 
E+ = Hd + Hc
1 + S , (7.32) 
E− = Hd − Hc
1 − S . (7.33) 
The eigenstates corresponding to the above two eigenvalues can be found by using 
each eigenvalue in Eq. (7.18) and solving the linear equation with respect to C1 and 
C2 and employing the normalization condition. The resulting expressions for the 
eigenstates are as follows: 
|φ+ =
1
√2(1 + S) (|f1+|f2), (7.34) 
|φ− =
1
√2(1 − S) (|f1−|f2). (7.35) 
7.2 Time Independent Perturbation Theory 
Perturbation theory is a general approximation method for solving a differential or 
integral equation, and plays an important role in practical applications of quantum 
mechanics because there are only few limited cases for which exact solutions of 
the Schrödinger equation are available. The term perturbation refers to a small 
deviation or disturbance from the original equation, and the theory allows finding 
approximate solutions in a systematic manner on the basis of solutions for the 
original unperturbed equation. Perturbation theory can be developed for both time 
independent and time dependent Schrödinger equations. The former, known as time 
independent perturbation theory, is presented here whereas the latter, known as time 
dependent perturbation theory, will be introduced in Chap. 10. 
The idea of time independent perturbation theory can be summarized in a general 
way for any eigenvalue problem. Let us consider a zeroth order operator Oˆ (0) and 
its eigenfunction or vector f (0) with eigenvalue λ(0) as follows. 
Oˆ (0)
f (0) = λ(0)
f (0)
. (7.36) 
Then, given that the operator is perturbed by an additional perturbation operator 
Oˆ (1)
, the main question is what will be the resulting corrections for f (0) and λ(0)
. 
To find the answer for this question, it is useful to introduce a small parameter 	7.2 Time Independent Perturbation Theory 211
that controls the magnitude of the perturbation and try to find out the solution for 
O(	) ˆ = Oˆ (0)+	Oˆ (1) as power series with respect to 	. In other words, let us assume 
that 
f (	) = f (0) + 	f (1) + 	2f (2) +··· , (7.37) 
λ(	) = λ(0) + 	λ(1) + 	2λ(2) +··· . (7.38) 
Then, employing these expressions in the new eigenvalue equation, O(	)f (	) ˆ =
λ(	)f (	) and expanding the resulting expression with respect to 	 on both sides, we 
obtain the following equation: 

Oˆ (0) + 	Oˆ (1)
 f (0) + 	f (1) + 	2f (2) +··· 
= Oˆ (0)
f (0) + 	

Oˆ (0)
f (1) + Oˆ (1)
f (0)

+ 	2

Oˆ (0)
f (2) + Oˆ (1)
f (1)

+···
= λ(0)
f (0) + 	

λ(0)
f (1) + λ(1)
f (0)

+	2

λ(0)
f (2) + λ(1)
f (1) + λ(2)
f (0)

+··· , (7.39) 
where both left and right sides of the equation were grouped into terms of the 
same order of 	. At the zeroth order of 	, the above equation is already satisfied 
by construction. In order for the above equation to be satisfied for any value of 	
including the particular case where 	 = 1, the equation for each term of 	n with 
n = 1, 2, 3, ··· has to be solved. This is a nontrivial task because corrections 
for both eigenfunction (or eigenvector) and eigenvalue have to be calculated, and 
solving the equation for the nth order in general requires solutions for all the lower 
orders. However, outcomes of such a task, once completed, can serve as powerful 
and general expressions applicable to a wide range of realistic situations. 
In applying the perturbation theory for quantum mechanics, it is particularly 
useful to employ the Dirac notation as described below. Let us first consider a zeroth 
order Hamiltonian Hˆ0 for which the eigenstates and the eigenvalues are known, and 
denote them as |ψ(0) n ’s and E(0) n ’s. Here, n is a label representing each eigenstate. 
Thus, for each n, 
Hˆ0|ψ(0) n  = E(0) n |ψ(0) n , (7.40) 
where ψ(0) n |ψ(0) m  = δnm. Then, let us introduce a perturbation Hamiltonian Hˆ1, 
which is assumed1 to be small compared to Hˆ0, and consider the following total
1 The smallness of Hˆ1 implies that its effect on the change of E(0) n is small compared to the level 
spacing of E(0) n ’s. Note that this definition of smallness has a problem in case there is degeneracy, 
for which a separate treatment is needed. 212 7 Approximation Methods for Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
Hamiltonian: 
Hˆ = Hˆ0 + 	Hˆ1, (7.41) 
where 	 does not necessarily have to be small and can simply be considered as a 
parameter to keep track of the order of the perturbation approximation. Once the 
solution is obtained for each order of 	, one can then set 	 = 1 without losing 
generality of the solution because it can be viewed that the small parameter has 
already been absorbed into Hˆ1. 
In short, the perturbation theory amounts to solving the following equation: 
(Hˆ0 + 	Hˆ1)|ψn = En|ψn, (7.42) 
by expanding |ψn and En as powers of 	 such that each term in the expansion 
can ultimately be expressed in terms of |ψ(0) n  and E(0) n . The development of the 
perturbation theory differs depending on whether E(0) n ’s are degenerate or non￾degenerate. The latter case is straightforward, and is described first. 
7.2.1 Non-Degenerate Perturbation Theory 
The starting point of the perturbation theory is the complete set of |ψ(0) n ’s, which 
are normalized eigenstates of Hˆ0, and their respective eigenvalues E(0) n ’s. All of 
these eigenvalues are assumed to be different for the present case. First, let us 
assume that the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the total Hamiltonian satisfying 
Eq. (7.42) can be expanded as follows: 
|ψn=|ψ(0) n  + 	|ψ(1) n  + 	2|ψ(2) n  + ..., (7.43) 
En = E(0) n + 	E(1) n + 	2E(2) n + .... (7.44) 
In Eq. (7.43), the second and the third terms can be expanded in terms of the 
eigenstates of the zeroth order Hamiltonian as follows: 
|ψ(1) n  = 
m	=n
C(1) m |ψ(0) m , (7.45) 
|ψ(2) n  = 
m	=n
C(2) m |ψ(0) m , (7.46) 
where the summation does not include the index n because it is already represented 
by the zeroth order state. Including this zeroth order state in the perturbation terms 
simply amounts to changing the normalization constant of the zeroth order state and 
does not result in any actual difference.7.2 Time Independent Perturbation Theory 213
Employing Eqs. (7.43) and (7.44), the Schrödinger equation for the perturbed 
Hamiltonian, Eq. (7.42), can be expressed as 
(Hˆ0 + 	Hˆ1)

|ψ(0) n  + 	|ψ(1) n  + 	2|ψ(2) n  + ... 
= (E(0) n + 	E(1) n + 	2E(2) n + ...) 
|ψ(0) n  + 	|ψ(1) n  + 	2|ψ(2) n  + ... 
.
(7.47) 
The perturbation theory amounts to solving the above equation for each order of 	
as described below. First, for the order of 	0, 
Hˆ0|ψ(0) n  = E(0) n |ψ(0) n , (7.48) 
which is already satisfied by the starting assumption, Eq. (7.40). The next order 
terms are considered below. 
First Order Terms of the Perturbation Expansion 
The terms corresponding to the first order of 	 in Eq. (7.47), when combined, 
lead to the following first order equation: 
Hˆ1|ψ(0) n  + Hˆ0|ψ(1) n  = E(1) n |ψ(0) n  + E(0) n |ψ(1) n , (7.49) 
where E(1) n and |ψ(1) n  are yet unknown and need to be determined. Note that 
|ψ(1) n  is assumed to be given by Eq. (7.45). Thus, determining this amounts 
to determining all the coefficients, C(1) m ’s. 
Equation (7.49) can be solved as follows. First, taking inner product with ψ(0) n |, 
we obtain 
ψ(0) n |Hˆ1|ψ(0) n +ψ(0) n |Hˆ0|ψ(1) n  = E(1) n ψ(0) n |ψ(0) n  + E(0) n ψ(0) n |ψ(1) n , (7.50) 
where ψ(0) n |ψ(1) n  = 0. In addition, ψ(0) n |Hˆ0|ψ(1) n  = E(0) n ψ(0) n |ψ(1) n  = 0 because 
|ψ(1) n  is expanded with respect to states that are orthogonal to |ψ(0) n  as can be seen 
from Eq. (7.45). On the righthand side of the above equation, ψ(0) n |ψ(0) n  = 1. For 
these reasons, we obtain a simple expression for the first order perturbation energy 
as summarized below.214 7 Approximation Methods for Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
First Order Perturbation Energy 
Equation (7.50) simplifies to the following expression for the first order 
perturbation correction of the energy. 
E(1) n = ψ(0) n |Hˆ1|ψ(0) n . (7.51) 
Note that the above expression is nothing but the expectation value of the 
perturbation Hamiltonian Hˆ1 with respect to the zeroth order eigenstate. 
Next, in order to determine |ψ(1) n , let us take inner product of Eq. (7.49) with 
ψ(0) m |, for m 	= n. This leads to 
ψ(0) m |Hˆ1|ψ(0) n +ψ(0) m |Hˆ0|ψ(1) n  = E(0) n ψ(0) m |ψ(1) n . (7.52) 
Note that ψ(0) m |Hˆ0 = ψ(0) m |E(0) m . From the definition of Eq. (7.45), ψ(0) m |ψ(1) n  =
C(1) m . Therefore, the above equation is equivalent to 
ψ(0) m |Hˆ1|ψ(0) n  + E(0) m C(1) m = E(0) n C(1) n , (7.53) 
This equation can be solved easily for C(1) m and leads to 
C(1) m = ψ(0) m |Hˆ1|ψ(0) n 
E(0) n − E(0) m
. (7.54) 
The above expression is well-defined for the present case because there is no 
degeneracy in the zeroth order energies. This also shows why the present approach 
cannot be used when there is degeneracy. 
First Order Perturbation State 
Employing the expression for C(1) m in the definition of Eq. (7.45), we obtain 
the following first order perturbation correction for the state |ψ(0) n : 
|ψ(1) n  = 
m	=n
C(1) m |ψ(0) m  = 
m	=n
|ψ(0) m ψ(0) m |Hˆ1|ψ(0) n 
E(0) n − E(0) m
. (7.55) 
Next, let us consider the second order terms of Eq. (7.47) by collecting all the 
terms that are second order with respect to 	.7.2 Time Independent Perturbation Theory 215
Second Order Terms of the Perturbation Expansion 
The terms corresponding to the second order of 	 in Eq. (7.47), when 
combined, result in 
Hˆ1|ψ(1) n  + Hˆ0|ψ(2) n  = E(2) n |ψ(0) n  + E(1) n |ψ(1) n  + E(0) n |ψ(2) n ,(7.56) 
where |ψ(2) n  and E(2) n are as yet unknown and need to be determined. 
Taking inner product of Eq. (7.56) with ψ(0) n |, we obtain 
ψ(0) n |Hˆ1|ψ(1) n +ψ(0) n |Hˆ0|ψ(2) n 
= E(2) n ψ(0) n |ψ(0) n  + E(1) n ψ(0) n |ψ(1) n  + E(0) n ψ(0) n |ψ(2) n . (7.57) 
In the lefthand side of the above expression, 
ψ(0) n |Hˆ0|ψ(2) n  = E(0) n ψ(0) n |ψ(2) n  = 0, (7.58) 
where the second equality comes from the definition of |ψ(2) n , Eq. (7.46), which 
is expanded only with respect to those states that are orthogonal to |ψ(0) n . In 
addition, in the righthand side of Eq. (7.57), ψ(0) n |ψ(0) n  = 1, ψ(0) n |ψ(1) n  = 0, 
and ψ(0) n |ψ(2) n  = 0. All of these, when combined, lead to a general expression for 
the second order perturbation energy as summarized below. 
Second Order Perturbation Energy 
Equation (7.56) reduces to the following expression for the second order 
perturbation correction for the energy: 
E(2) n = ψ(0) n |Hˆ1|ψ(1) n  = 
m	=n
C(1) m ψ(0) n |Hˆ1|ψ(0) m 
= 
m	=n
ψ(0) m |Hˆ1|ψ(0) n ψ(0) n |Hˆ1|ψ(0) m 
E(0) n − E(0) m
. (7.59) 
In each term of the summation in the above expression, the numerator is 
nonnegative as follows: 
ψ(0) m |Hˆ1|ψ(0) n ψ(0) n |Hˆ1|ψ(0) m  =

≥ 0. (7.60) 
(continued)216 7 Approximation Methods for Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
An important implication of this is that the second order perturbation order 
correction for the ground state energy always lowers its value because the 
denominator of each term in the summation is always negative. 
We can obtain the second order correction for the state by taking inner product 
of Eq. (7.56) with ψ(0) m | for m 	= n. Thus, we obtain 
ψ(0) m |Hˆ1|ψ(1) n +ψ(0) m |Hˆ0|ψ(2) n  = E(1) n ψ(0) m |ψ(1) n  + E(0) n ψ(0) m |ψ(2) n ,
(7.61) 
where the fact that ψ(0) m |ψ(0) n  = 0 has been used in obtaining the righthand side. 
Now using Eq. (7.55) and the fact that ψ(0) m |Hˆ0|ψ(2) n  = C(2) m E(0) m on the lefthand 
side of the above equation, we find that

7.2.2 Degenerate Perturbation Theory 
When there is degeneracy, the expressions, Eqs. (7.66) and (7.67), cannot be used 
because the denominator becomes zero, i.e., E(0) n − E(0) m = 0, for degenerate states. 
Thus, a different approach [4–8] should be used for these states. 
Let us assume that there are d degenerate eigenstates of Hˆ0 with energy E(0) n as 
shown below: 
|ψ(0)
n,1,..., |ψ(0)
n,d . (7.68) 
Then, any linear combination of these states can be an eigenstate with the same 
energy E(0) n . Among all possible linear combinations, there can be unique d linear 
combinations that are least affected by the perturbation Hˆ1 and thus serve as the best 
starting point for applying the perturbation theory. Let us denote them as |φ(0)
n,k’s 
with k = 1, ··· , d.218 7 Approximation Methods for Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
Each |φ(0)
n,k can be expressed as a linear combination of |ψ(0)
n,k’s as follows: 
|φ(0)
n,k = C1|ψ(0)
n,1+···+ Cd |ψ(0)
n,d  , k = 1, ··· ,d. (7.69) 
Then, let us assume that the eigenstate of Hˆ that reduces to the one with eigenvalue 
E(0) n in the absence of perturbation (the limit of 	 → 0), can be expanded as 
|φn,k=|φ(0)
n,k + 	|φ(1)
n,k + 	2|φ(2)
n,k + ..., (7.70) 
where detailed expressions for |φ(1)
n,k and |φ(2)
n,k will be provided later in this section. 
Employing Eq. (7.70) in Eq. (7.42), we obtain 
(Hˆ0 + 	Hˆ1)

|φ(0)
n,k + 	|φ(1)
n,k + 	2|φ(2)

n,k + 	|φ(1)
n,k + 	2|φ(2)
n,k + . . . ). (7.71) 
The zeroth order term (	0) of Eq. (7.71) is Hˆ0|φ(0)
n,k = E(0) n |φ(0)
n,k, which is already 
satisfied since |φ(0)
n,k is a linear combination of all states with the same energy 
eigenvalue En. The first order terms are considered below. 
First Order Term of the Degenerate Perturbation Theory 
Collecting all the terms that are first order with respect to 	 in Eq. (7.71), we 
obtain 
Hˆ1|φ(0)
n,k + Hˆ0|φ(1)
n,k = E(1) n |φ(0)
n,k + E(0) n |φ(1)
n,k. (7.72) 
Taking inner product of Eq. (7.72) with ψ(0)
n,j | for j = 1,...,d, we obtain

n,j |Hˆ1|φ(0)
n,k+ψ(0)

n,j |Hˆ0|φ(1)
n,k = E(0) n ψ(0)
n,j |φ(1)
n,k, 
which cancels with the same term on the righthand side. Inserting Eq. (7.69) into the 
resulting equation leads to a general set of equations that can be solved to determine 
all the coefficients of Eq. (7.69) as described below.7.2 Time Independent Perturbation Theory 219
First Order Correction for the Eigenvalue and the Zeroth Order Correc￾tion for the Eigenstate 
Employing Eq. (7.69) in Eq. (7.73) and canceling all terms that are identical 
on both sides of the resulting equation, we obtain 
H1n,j1C1 +H1n,j2C2 +···+H1n,j dCd = E(1) n Cj , j = 1,... ,d, (7.74) 
where 
H1n,jk = ψ(0)

Equation (7.74) for all j can be expressed as the following matrix equation:

the solution of which results in the first order degenerate perturbation 
correction for the energy, E(1)
n,k for k = 1, ··· , d. 
For each solution of E(1)
n,k, one can find the corresponding set of coefficients 
Ck’s in Eq. (7.69), which results in the zeroth order eigenstate |φ(0)
n,k for each 
E(1)
n,k as follows: 
|φ(0)
n,k = 

j=1
C(0)
n,kj |ψ(0)

where C(0)
n,kj ’s are solutions of the matrix equation, Eq. (7.76), for the eigen￾value E(1)
n,k and are assumed to satisfy the normalization condition.220 7 Approximation Methods for Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
If all the E(1)
n,k’s are different, one can then apply the non-degenerate perturbation 
theory employing |φ(0)
n,k’s as the starting point. However, if there is degeneracy in 
E(1)
n,k’s, one should again consider linear combination of those degenerate states in 
going up to the next order in a manner similar to finding the degenerate first order 
corrections for the eigenvalue and the zeroth order corrections for the states, which 
results in additional complications. 
Here, let us consider only the case where E(1)
n,k’s are non-degenerate. So far, we 
have considered the perturbation effects of degenerate states only. However, other 
non-degenerate states can still make some contributions as well, which have to be 
added to the results of the degenerate perturbation theory in an appropriate manner. 
As the first step for calculating higher order terms, we need to find out the 
first order correction for the eigenstate |φ(1)
n,k in Eq. (7.72). Taking inner product 
of Eq. (7.72) with φ(0)
n,j | for j 	= k, we obtain 
φ(0)
n,j |Hˆ1|φ(0)
n,k+φ(0)
n,j |Hˆ0|φ(1)
n,k = E(1) n φ(0)
n,j |φ(0)
n,k + E(0) n φ(0)
n,j |φ(1)
n,k. (7.79) 
In the above equation, φ(0)
n,j |Hˆ1|φ(0)
n,k = 0 since Hˆ1 is diagonal in the basis of new 
zeroth order eigenstates, |φ(0)
n,j ’s. Similarly, φ(0)
n,j |φ(0)
n,k = 0. On the other hand, 
φ(0)
n,j |Hˆ0|φ(1)
n,k = E(0) n φ(0)
n,j |φ(1)
n,k, which becomes the same as the second term on 
the righthand side of the above equation. Thus, Eq. (7.79) is already satisfied. 
Therefore, the expansion coefficients of |φ(1)
n,k with respect to |φ(0)
n,j  remain 
undetermined at the first order level. On the other hand, the expansion coefficients 
with respect to other non-degenerates states, |ψ(0) m , where m 	= n1, ··· , nd , can 
be determined in the same manner as the non-degenerate perturbation theory as 
summarized below. 
First Order Correction for the Degenerate Eigenstate (Incomplete) 
Taking inner product of Eq. (7.72) with ψ(0) m |, where m 	= n, one can 
determine the expansion coefficients of |φ(1)
n,k with respect to |ψ(0) m ’s and 
find the following expression:

where D(1)
j ’s are yet undetermined. Consideration of the second order pertur￾bation terms is necessary to determine these as will be shown below.7.2 Time Independent Perturbation Theory 221
The second order corrections for the eigenvalue and eigenstate can be obtained 
by considering all the second order terms in Eq. (7.71) as explained below. 
Second Order Term of the Degenerate Perturbation Theory 
Collecting all the terms that are second order with respect to 	 in Eq. (7.71), 
we obtain 
Hˆ0|φ(2)
n,k + Hˆ1|φ(1)
n,k = E(0) n |φ(2)
n,k + E(1)
n,k|φ(1)
n,k + E(2)

n,k, (7.81) 
where |φ(1)
n,k is orthogonal to |φ(0)
n,k according to Eq. (7.80) and |φ(2)
n,k is also 
assumed to be orthogonal to |φ(0)
n,k by construction. In the above equation, 
E(2)
n,k and |φ(2)
n,k as well as part of |φ(1)
n,k are yet undetermined, for which the 
equation needs to be solved. 
Let us take inner product of Eq. (7.81) with φ(0)
n,k|. Then, 
φ(0)
n,k|Hˆ0|φ(2)
n,k+φ(0)

n,k, (7.82) 
where the fact that |φ(1)
n,k and |φ(2)
n,k are orthogonal to |φ(0)
n,k has been used on 
the righthand side. On the lefthand side of the above equation, the first term also 
becomes zero as follows: φ(0)
n,k|Hˆ0|φ(2)
n,k = E(0) n φ(0)
n,k|φ(2)
n,k = 0. Thus, E(2)
n,k simply 
becomes the second term on the lefthand side, for which Eq. (7.80) can be used as 
summarized below. 
Second Order Correction for the Degenerate Eigenvalue 
Employing Eq. (7.80) for the second term on the lefthand side of Eq. (7.82), 
we obtain

Note that the sum involving degenerate states with the unknown coef￾ficients D(1)
j in Eq. (7.80) do not contribute to the above term because 
φ(0)
n,k|Hˆ1|φ(0)
n,j  = 0 for j 	= k.222 7 Approximation Methods for Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
As the next step, let us take inner product of Eq. (7.81) with φ(0)
n,j | for j 	= k. 
Thus, 
φ(0)
n,j |Hˆ0|φ(2)

equation, the first term, φ(0)
n,j |Hˆ0|φ(2)
n,k = E(0) n φ(0)
n,j |φ(2)
n,k, cancels out with the same

φ(0)
n,j |Hˆ1|φ(1)
n,k = E(1)
n,kφ(0)
n,j |φ(1)
n,k. (7.85) 
This equation can be used to determine the D(1)

7.3 Summary and Questions 
The variational principle results from the boundedness of the ground state energy for 
a stable quantum system, and thus offers an important guideline for approximating 
the ground state energy. Proving the variational principle is simple, and is based 
on the completeness of the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian. However, finding out 
an actual approximation is not always straightforward. Given that it is possible 
to identify a reasonable basis states that can be used to represent a trial state as 
a linear combination, it is possible to reduce the variational principle to a set of 
linear equations involving coefficients and eigenvalues, Eq. (7.18). Eigenvalues of 
this equation can be determined by solving Eq. (7.19). Employing these solutions 
in Eq. (7.18), one can then determine corresponding eigenstates. The resulting 
eigenstates, even when expanded in terms of nonorthogonal basis states, are 
orthogonal for different eigenvalues and can also be made to be orthogonal between 
states with the same eigenvalue. 
The time independent perturbation theory provides general expressions for 
approximate eigenvalues and eigenstates of a Hamiltonian, which is given by a224 7 Approximation Methods for Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
sum of the zeroth order and small perturbation terms. The solutions are provided 
in terms of those for the zeroth order Hamiltonian. The reason for why this is 
always possible is because the eigenstates of the zeroth order Hamiltonian forms 
a complete basis. For the case where there is no degeneracy in the zeroth order 
Hamiltonian, perturbation corrections for the energies and states can be obtained by 
comparison of terms of the same order of the perturbation and projecting them to 
different eigenstates of the zeroth order Hamiltonian. The resulting corrections for 
the eigenvalues and eigenstates up to the second order of the perturbation are given 
by Eqs. (7.66) and (7.67). 
However, for the case where there is degeneracy in the zeroth order Hamiltonian, 
the expressions obtained for the non-degenerate case become singular, and the 
theory should be developed in a slightly different manner. It turns out that 
identifying the best zeroth order eigenstates that suit the type of the Hamiltonian 
should precede determination of higher order terms. Diagonalizing the perturbation 
Hamiltonian in the space of degenerate states of the zeroth order Hamiltonian 
solves this issue. Thus, the first order corrections for the eigenvalues are given by 
solutions of Eq. (7.76) and the zeroth eigenstates are given by Eq. (7.78). Further 
consideration of higher order corrections including those of other non-degenerate 
components leads to the expression for the second order correction for the energy, 
Eq. (7.83), and the first correction for the state, Eq. (7.88). 
Questions
• How general is the variational principle? Is there any possible exception 
where it is inapplicable?
• In applying the variational principle, it is common to approximate the 
trial state as a linear combination of predetermined basis states. What are 
benefits and limitations of this approximation?
• Is it possible to extend the variational principle for the calculation of 
excited state energies?
• For the case where the trial state is given by a linear combination of basis 
states, solving an eigenvalue equation produces many states and energies 
as solutions of the variational principle. Can all the higher energy states, 
except for the lowest energy state, be also used as solutions of the starting 
time independent Schrödinger equation?
• How can we examine the accuracy of a particular outcome of the varia￾tional theory?
• Expressions for the non-degenerate perturbation theory are inapplicable for 
the case where there is degeneracy in the zeroth order Hamiltonian. What 
is the reason for this?
• Are the states obtained from the perturbation theory normalized?

where the fact that |C˜1|

of the above expressions shows that the minimum value Eφ is a, which occurs 
when C2 = C3 = 0 and the third equality shows that the maximum value of Eφ
is 3a, which occurs when C1 = C2 = 0. 
(c) For the given Hamiltonian, H11 = a, H22 = 2a, and H33 = 3a and all other 
terms are zero. On the other hand, Sij = δij . Therefore,

The above matrix is already diagonal. Thus, the three values of E are a, 2a, and 
3a. The states corresponding to these values are respectively, |1, |2, and |3. 
(d) The ground state is |1 and its energy is E(0)

energy is zero as can be seen below. 
E(1)

Therefore, up to the second order of perturbation, the ground state energy 
becomes corrected to

Many Electron Systems and Atomic 
Spectroscopy 
The mathematical framework of quantum theory has passed 
countless successful tests and is now universally accepted as a 
consistent and accurate description of all atomic phenomena. 
– Erwin Schrödinger 
Abstract This chapter explains approximate quantum mechanical description of 
many electron (more than one) atoms and their electronic spectroscopy. A quick 
overview of independent electron model revisits well-established concepts of 
atomic orbitals and configurations, and clarifies approximations involved in such 
description. Symmetry properties of spin-orbit states and simple methods for 
determining atomic term symbols are described. Rules for determining relative 
energies of atomic terms and selection rules for atomic spectroscopy are clarified. 
The chapter then provides a more detailed mathematical account of independent 
electron approximations using helium atom as an example and then provides a 
general description of the self-consistent approximation for many electron atoms.

Although Eq. (8.1) is a simple extension of the Hamiltonian for hydrogen-like 
systems, the fact that it involves interactions of three or more particles causes the 
corresponding quantum mechanical problem much more challenging. In particular, 
the last electron-electron repulsion term makes it impossible to solve the corre￾sponding Schrödinger equation exactly. 
Assuming that the nucleus is fixed at the origin (or considering in such coordinate 
system), one can reduce Eq. ( 8.1) to the following many electron Hamiltonian:

where rˆj = |rˆj |. Even with this simplification, there is no exact analytic solution of 
the Schrödinger equation for this Hamiltonian for Ne ≥ 2. Therefore, one has to rely 
on approximation methods. Due to the fact that electrons are fermions satisfying the 
Pauli exclusion principle, care should be taken in employing approximation meth￾ods. We will first start with the simplest approximation of assuming independent 
electrons, which can be justified with a proper application of the variational principle 
as will be detailed later in this chapter. 
8.2 Independent Electron Model 
8.2.1 Major Assumptions 
At the simplest level, the effects of electron-electron interactions can be accounted 
for by introducing an effective single-electron potential, which modifies the original 
electron-nucleus Coulomb interaction while treating each electron independently. 
This means assuming that an electron labelled j , for example, can be described by 
the following effective Hamiltonian: 
Hˆj,eff = pˆ 2
j
2me
− Zeff,j e2
4π0rˆj
+ δVj (rˆj ), (8.5) 
where Zeff,j is a screened nuclear charge that the electron labeled as j experiences 
and δVj (rˆj ) represents additional effects of other electrons that cannot be expressed8.2 Independent Electron Model 243
in the form of the Coulomb potential. In general, the value of Zeff,j and the 
detailed form of δVj (rˆj ) should depend on the states of other electrons. This way, 
interdependency of different electrons are taken into consideration implicitly. 
Care should be taken in devising an approximation as outlined above because 
the physical reality dictates that it is not possible to distinguish one electron from 
the other. For this reason, the labeling of electrons does not have genuine physical 
meaning and should be viewed as an intermediate step for calculating physical 
properties that are independent of the specific manner of the labeling. In addition, 
any many-electron state should be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of 
any two electrons, which brings further complication. These issues will be addressed 
later in this chapter. For now, let us assume that an effective single electron state can 
be determined by solving the Schrödinger equation for the Hamiltonian of the type 
given by Eq. (8.5). 
Because of the fact that the potential energy in Eq. ( 8.5) depends only on 
the magnitude operator of the position, rˆj = |rˆj |, the effective Hamiltonian 
commutes with the angular momentum operators Lˆ 2 and Lˆ z. Therefore, within 
this approximation, the angular momentum quantum numbers l and ml still serve 
as good quantum numbers. Another important fact is that the effective electron￾nucleus Coulomb term of the potential remains dominant compared to the additional 
correction. This makes the principal quantum number of n determined for a 
hydrogen-like system a nearly good quantum number for classifying the eigenstates 
of the Hamiltonian. However, there is major difference from the hydrogen-like 
system in that the degeneracy of the energy for different values of l, which is a 
non-negative integer in the range of [0, n − 1] for a given quantum number n, gets 
lifted due to the additional term δVj (rˆj ). Important qualitative trends and major 
definitions of terms are provided below. 
Summary of Independent Electron Model 
• For many-electron atoms,(n, l, ml) serve as nearly good quantum numbers 
to represent effective spatial single electron states, which are also termed 
as orbitals. 
• The collection of orbitals having the same value of n constitute a shell. 
Shells with n = 1, 2, 3, and 4,... are respectively denoted as K, L, M, 
N, ... . 
• The energy of each orbital depends on both n and l, which are used for the 
labeling of different orbitals. Orbitals with l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called 
s, p, d, f , g, ··· , respectively. 
• For each value of l, there are 2l + 1 degenerate orbitals (in the absence of 
external field) with different values of m.
• For a given shell, orbitals with smaller values of l have lower energies than 
those with higher values of l. This is because electrons tend to have higher 
probability density near the nucleus for smaller value of l, which causes 
them to experience lower Coulomb potential energy.244 8 Many Electron Systems and Atomic Spectroscopy
Table 8.1 Numbers of 
orbitals and maximum 
numbers of electrons allowed 
for different types of orbitals

Number of orbitals 1 3 5 7 9 11 
Number of electrons 2 6 10 14 18 22 
Given that all the single electron states have been identified in a given atom, one 
can then assign electrons to those states as if assigning one electron does not affect 
the other except for satisfying the symmetry rule for electrons as fermions. For this, 
first, it is important to note that a state of an electron is defined by specifying both 
its orbital (spatial state) and the spin state. Since electrons are fermions, only one 
electron can occupy one state. Since there are two spin states for each electron, this 
means that a single orbital can be occupied by two electrons at most. 
8.2.2 Orbitals and Electronic Configuration 
Since the number of orbitals for a given l is (2l + 1), the maximum number of 
electrons allowed for orbitals with l are 2(2l + 1), as shown in Table 8.1. 
Assuming that electrons for a given atom can be filled in one by one such that 
each of them occupies the lowest possible orbital, which is called Aufbau principle 
(building-up principle), it is possible to assign the relative order of orbitals. 
The Order of Orbitals Based on Relative Energies 
Given that all the orbitals with lower energies have already been filled, the 
following order of energies of orbitals has been established empirically. 
− Increasing relative energy→
1s
2s 2p
3s 3p 3d
4s 4p 4d 4f
5s 5p 5d 5f
6s 6p 6d
7s 7p
In the above lists, each row represents different principal quantum number, 
and the orbitals on the right have higher energies than those on the left. Note 
that the intervals between different orbitals do not reflect the actual values of 
energy difference. Rather, the differences of energies become smaller as the 
principal quantum number increases.8.2 Independent Electron Model 245
The main factor that determines the relative energies are principal quantum 
numbers for s and p orbitals. However, for d and f orbitals, this is not the case. 
For example, nd orbitals have higher energies than (n + 1)s orbitals but lower 
energies than (n + 1)p orbitals. The atoms for which the d orbitals are partially 
filled correspond to transition metal elements. Also note that nf orbital has higher 
energy than (n + 2)s orbital but lower energy than (n + 1)d orbital. The atoms for 
which the f orbitals are partially filled are known as lanthanides and actinides. 
With these rules, it is now possible to determine all the ground state electron 
configurations for all the many-electron atoms. Some examples of ground state 
electronic configuration are shown below. 
Li :1s22s1
C :1s22s22p2
Fe :1s22s22p63s23p64s23d6
On the other hand, the following configurations correspond to excited state elec￾tronic configurations for the same atoms.

C :1s12s12p3; 1s12s22p13s1
Fe :1s22s22p63s23p64s23d54p1; 1s22s22p63s23p64s13d64p1
8.2.3 Spin States 
The total spin quantum number of two electrons occupying the same orbital is zero 
because it is possible only when their spins are opposite to each other. Likewise, 
when any type of orbitals is fully filled, the sum of all the spins of electrons is 
zero. Therefore, the total spin quantum number is zero for the following completely 
filled configurations:s2, p6, d10, f 14, andg18. For partially filled orbitals, there are 
various ways for the spins of electrons to be aligned with respect to each other. As 
a result, multiple spin states are possible. 
Before detailed consideration of the spin states of partially filled orbitals, some 
mathematical account of the symmetry properties of many electron quantum states 
is needed. First of all, it is important to examine the properties of electrons as 
fermions. For many electron systems, this means that the total state should change 
its sign if two electrons are exchanged with each other. For example, consider the 
following multi-electron state: 
|Ne =|1, 2, ··· , j, ··· , k, ··· , Ne, (8.6)246 8 Many Electron Systems and Atomic Spectroscopy
where j denotes the label of each electron and the position of each label represents 
a single electron spin-orbit state that each electron is assigned to. For |N  to be 
an acceptable N electron state, it should change its sign if electrons j and k are 
exchanged with each other as follows: 
|Ne  = −|1, 2, ··· , k, ··· , j, ··· , Ne. (8.7) 
For two electrons, this means that the spin states are antisymmetric when the orbital 
states are symmetric and vice versa. 
For example, let us consider the s orbital for which there is only one orbital 
available for two electrons. The only possible two-electron orbital state in this case 
is 
|s(1, 2)=|φs(1)⊗|φs(2)=|φs(1)|φs(2), (8.8) 
which is symmetric with respect to exchange of the two electrons because the order 
of two states in a direct product does not make any difference. The only two-electron 
spin state compatible with the above two-electron s orbital state is the following 
antisymmetric spin state called singlet: 
|χS(1, 2) =
1
√2
(|α(1)|β(2)−|α(2)|β(1)), (8.9) 
which satisfies the antisymmetric property, |χS(1, 2) = −|χS(2, 1). For this state, 
the total spin of electron is zero. Thus, the only acceptable two-electron spin-orbit 
state where two electrons occupy the same orbital is 
|(1, 2)=|s(1, 2)|χS(1, 2), (8.10) 
which satisfies the antisymmetric property, |(1, 2) = −|(2, 1) and has the total 
spin quantum number ofS = 0. 
On the other hand, one can also construct symmetric spin states. For two 
electrons, there are three such states as follows: 
|χT (1, 2) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
|α(1)|α(2)
√
1
2 (|α(1)|β(2)+|β(1)|α(2))
|β(1)|β(2)
(8.11) 
These three states are collectively called triplet and have the total spin quantum 
number S = 1. 
Let us now consider the case where two different orbitals |φa and |φb are 
available for two electrons. There are two possible ways for the two electrons occupy8.2 Independent Electron Model 247
these orbitals without violating the fact that they are indistinguishable as follows: 
|sym(1, 2) =
1
√2
(|φa(1)|φb(2)+|φa(2)|φb(1)), (8.12) 
|asym(1.2) =
1
√2 
(|φa(1)|φb(2)−|φa(2)|φb(1)). (8.13) 
Then, the total spin-orbit states possible for the two electrons are as follows: 
|S(1, 2)=|sym(1, 2)|χS(1, 2), (8.14) 
|T (1, 2)=|asym(1, 2)|χT (1, 2). (8.15) 
Note that both of above two states are antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of 
two electrons. These two states show that fully decoupled orbital and spin parts can 
be used to construct all possible and independent spin-orbit states for two electrons. 
However, it is not always the case for more than two electrons. 
8.2.4 Energy Levels of Spin-Orbit States 
While it is possible to determine relative energies of different configurations, a given 
electronic configuration does not provide full information on the energy of the many 
electron system because there are still many ways for the total angular momenta 
to be added up. For this, it is necessary to define all possible angular momentum 
quantum numbers that can be defined for many electron systems. 
Angular Momentum Quantum Numbers for Many Electron System 
Let us denote the orbital angular momentum vector and spin vector of the ith 
electron as li and si, respectively. Different types of total angular momenta 
exist as described below. 
• Total angular momentum quantum number of a single electron (j )— 
This represents the sum of orbital angular momentum and spin of an 
electron. Because s = 1/2, for a given value of l, there are only two 
possible values,j = l + 1/2, l − 1/2. 
• Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of all the electrons 
(L)—This represents the quantum number for the sum of the orbital 
angular momenta of all the electrons. 
• Total spin quantum number of all the electrons (S) -This represents the 
quantum number for the sum of the spins of all the electrons. 
(continued)248 8 Many Electron Systems and Atomic Spectroscopy
• Total angular momentum quantum number of all the electrons (J )— 
This represents the sum of all the angular momenta of all the electrons. 
• Each of the angular momentum quantum numbers listed above corre￾sponds to the quantum numbers of the squares of corresponding angular 
momentum vector operators, ˆj, Lˆ , Sˆ, and Jˆ. In other words, h¯
2j (j + 1), 
h¯
2L(L + 1), h¯
2S(S + 1), and h¯
2J (J + 1) are respectively eigenvalues 
of ˆj
2, Lˆ 2, Sˆ 2, and Jˆ2. With this understanding, for the determination of 
the quantum numbers, one has to consider only the vector nature of the 
orbital angular momentum operators. Therefore, we will omit the operator 
symbols whenever possible, and consider only the corresponding vectors 
in the consideration below. 
Since the total angular momentum, namely, the sum of all orbital angular 
momenta and spins of all electrons, Jˆ, is a conserved quantity due to the spherical 
symmetry of the system, its quantum number J is always a good quantum number 
and can be included in any classification of the eigenstates of many-electron atoms. 
There are two ways to find out this quantum number. First, we can add all the orbital 
angular momentum vectors and spin vectors as follows: 
L = 
i
li, (8.16) 
S = 
i
si. (8.17) 
Then, the total sum of the angular momentum and the spin vectors is given by 
J = L + S. (8.18) 
This is called LS-coupling or Russell-Saunders coupling scheme, and works well 
when spin-orbit coupling of an individual electron is weak as in most light atoms. 
This is not the case for heavy atoms for which the large nuclear charge creates strong 
spin-orbit coupling especially for those core electrons. For this case, the following 
individual j’s serve as better quantum numbers. 
ji = li + si. (8.19) 
The total angular momentum vector in this case is given by 
J = 
i
ji. (8.20)8.2 Independent Electron Model 249
This is called jj -coupling scheme, which becomes complicated as the number of 
electrons increases. 
8.2.5 Examples of Energy Levels Based on LS-Coupling 
Scheme 
Within the LS-coupling scheme, one only needs to specify L, S, and J values. The 
electronic term symbols introduced in Chap. 6 can be used for this purpose. Let us 
consider the simplest example, two electrons in helium, He. The ground electronic 
configuration of He is 1s2. Since this corresponds to a completely filled orbital, 
L = 0 and S = 0. Therefore, J = 0 as well. This configuration has only one term, 
1S0. 
Next, let us consider an excited state configuration of He given by 1s12p1. For 
this, only L = 1 is possible. On the other hand, for the total spin, S = 0, 1 are 
possible. Since two electrons occupy two different orbitals, either S = 0 or S = 1
is acceptable. WhenS = 0, onlyJ = 1 is possible. The term symbol for this case is 
1P1. When S = 1, three values of J = 0, 1, 2 are possible. Term symbols for these 
cases are as follows:3P0, 3P1, and3P2. 
For Li, which has three electrons, the ground electronic configuration is 1s22s1. 
This is effectively one electron system since two electrons are in a completely filled 
orbital. The orbital angular momentum quantum number of this electron is L = 0, 
since it is in s orbital. For this one electron, S = 1/2. The only possible combination 
of this spin and the orbital angular momentum L = 0 is such that J = 1/2. 
Therefore, the term symbol for this is 2S1/2. 
For Be, there are four electrons. However, the ground electronic configuration is 
1s22s2, where two s orbitals are completely filled. As in the case of He, L = 0, 
S = 0, andJ = 0 for this configuration. Therefore, the term symbol for this is 1S0. 
For boron, B, there are five electrons. Out of these, four electrons completely 
fill in 1s and 2s orbitals and only one electron occupies a 2 p orbital. Therefore, 
the ground electronic configuration is 1s22s22p1. For this, L = 1 and S = 1/2. 
Possible values of J in this case are 3/2 and 1/2. Therefore, there are two terms, 
2P1/2 and 2P3/2. 
Determination of term symbols so far have been simple because orbitals are 
completely filled or occupied with single electrons. When there are more than one 
electrons occupying the same orbital, care should be taken. This is the case for 
carbon, C, for which the ground electronic configuration is 1s22s22p2. Although 
all the electrons are equivalent for a given atom, for practical reasons, it is 
assumed that electrons assigned to different orbitals have unique labels and are 
thus nonequivalent. This is certainly an approximation but a useful one. Within this 
approximation, electrons in the filled orbitals need not be considered because their 
net orbital and spin angular momenta are zero. Thus, two electrons in unfilled p
orbitals only need to be considered.250 8 Many Electron Systems and Atomic Spectroscopy

For the two electrons occupying 2 p orbitals, the total angular momentum 
quantum numbers of L = 2, 1, 0 are possible. For the total spin, two quantum 
numbers for the total spinS = 0, 1 are possible. Due to the symmetry requirement, 
not all the three values of L can be combined with the two values of S. Instead, only 
the combinations given in Table 8.2 are possible. 
A simple way of finding term symbols without going through full angular 
momentum calculation as introduced by Landau and Lifshitz [ 7] is described below. 
Note that each electron has l = 1 and s = 1/2. Therefore, there are six possible 
combinations for the sets of(lz, sz) as follows: 
a :
	
1,
1
2


b :
	
0,
1
2


c :

1, −1
2


b :
	
0, −1
2


c :
	
−1, −1
2


The set of (Lz, Sz) can be found by summing two out of the above six states. In 
enumerating all possible sums, one needs to consider only two rules. First, the sum 
of the same set is not allowed because it is not possible to make it antisymmetric 
with respect to the exchange of two electrons. Second, we only need to consider 
nonnegative values ofLz and Sz because the numbers of positive and negative values 
are always the same. 
The resulting list of all possible distinctive combinations with non-negative 
values ofLz and Sz are as follows: 
a + a : (2, 0) a + b : (1, 1) a + c : (0, 1)
a + b : (1, 0) a + c : (0, 0)
a + b : (1, 0) a + c : (0, 0)
b + b : (0, 0) ,
where each column corresponds to a different value of Lz. For each column, those 
with higher value of Sz appear in upper rows. Based on the above combinations, it 
is possible to deduce all possible term symbols. 
First, the presence of (2, 0) means that there has to be a state with L = 2 and 
S = 0. This also means that there have to be two additional combinations: (1, 0)
and (0, 0), which correspond to different possible nonnegative values of Lz for 
L = 2 and S = 0. Thus, we have found three possible combinations of Lz and 
Sz corresponding to the term 1D. Removing these combinations from the list of8.2 Independent Electron Model 251
combinations shown above, we are now left with the following combinations: 
(1, 1) (0, 1)
(1, 0) (0, 0)
(0, 0)
Note that the origin of each of the above combinations has been left out because 
it does not matter in identifying term symbols. In the above combinations, the 
presence of (1, 1) implies that there has to be a state with L = 1 and S = 1. This 
implies the existence of the following combinations: Lz = 1, Sz = 1, 0; Lz = 0, 
Sz = 1, 0. All of these correspond to (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0), which constitute 
the term3P. Subtracting these from the above combinations, we are now left with the 
following single combination: (0, 0). This single combination implies that L = 0
and S = 0, which corresponds to the term 1S. Thus, we have identified all three 
terms that appear in Table 8.2, 1D, 3P, and 1S. For each case, all possible values 
of J can be obtained following the rules for the addition of angular momentum 
quantum numbers explained before. 
The approach described above can be extended to the case of three electrons. 
Consider the configurationp3. All the possible combinations are as follows: 
a + a + b : (2,
1
2
) a + a + c : (1,
1
2
) a + b + c : (0,
3

)
a + b + b : (1,

2
) a + b + c : (0,
1
2
)
a + b + c : (0,
1
2
)
a + b + c : (0,
1
2
)
From the above combinations, following a similar procedure, we can find out the 
following term symbols:4S3
2
, 2P3
2
, 2P1
2
, 2D5
2
, and 2D3
2
. 
Having identified all possible terms, the next step is to determine the relative 
energy levels. There are three well known rules [ 31] for this. First, two rules by 
Hund prescribe relative energies based on the values of L and S as described below. 
Hund’s Rules 
According to Hund, relative energies of different terms can be determined 
based on the following two rules: 
(i) Of all the terms arising from the same electronic configuration, those with 
the highest multiplicity (largest value of S) lie lowest in energy. 
(continued)252 8 Many Electron Systems and Atomic Spectroscopy
(ii) Of all the terms with the same value of S arising from the same electronic 
configuration, the lowest is that with the highest value of L. 
The justification for (i) is that the states with the largest multiplicity have the 
lowest electron-electron repulsion. The justification for (ii) is that the highest 
L states can penetrate toward the nucleus more easily, and thus experiences 
larger effective charge and thus lower energy. 
Of the terms with the same values of L and S that originate from the same 
electronic configuration, Lande’s interval rule as described below then prescribes 
relative energies depending on the value of J . 
Lande’s Interval Rule 
For less than half-filled orbitals, smaller J has lower energy (normal case). 
For more than half filled orbitals, larger J has lower energy (inverted case). 
This is due to the spin-orbit coupling, which results in the following form of 
energy difference between different values of J :
EJ − EJ−1 = AJ. (8.21) 
A is positive for normal case and is negative for inverted case. The above 
prescription leaves the case with exactly half-filled case undetermined, for 
which the rule for normal case seems to work in general. 
8.2.6 Atomic Spectroscopy: Selection Rules and Simple 
Examples 
Atomic spectroscopy results from the transition between many electron states 
due to interaction with a photon. The Russell-Saunders coupling scheme and 
the corresponding electronic terms can be used for fairly accurate description of 
the spectroscopy of light atoms and the relevant selection rules [ 31] are easy to 
understand.8.2 Independent Electron Model 253
Selection Rules for General Many-Electron Atoms 
The general selection rules governing the transition between two electronic 
states of many-electron atoms,(L
, S
, J 
) → (L, S, J ), are as follows. 
S = 0 (8.22)
L =

±1, 0 if L = 0 
1 if L = 0 (8.23)
J = 0, ±1 ( no 0↔ 0 transition) (8.24) 
The fact that the total spin of electrons does not change, Eq. ( 8.22), results 
from the fact that electrons interact only with the electric field component of the 
light which does not affect the spins of electrons. Of course, this selection rule 
can be broken if there is significant spin-orbit coupling. The selection rule for 
L, Eq. (8.23), results from the fact that the sum of the total angular momentum 
of electrons and the spin of photon, which is one, should remain conserved. The 
selection rule concerningJ is an outcome of those for S and L. 
Another important selection rule that is fundamental but can be overlooked easily 
is the Laporte’s rule as described below. 
Laporte’s Rule 
The transition in atomic spectroscopy is allowed only between terms origi￾nating from two different electronic configurations that satisfies the following 
condition: 

i
li : even ↔ odd (8.25) 
This rule results from the fact that the dipole operator involved in the 
interaction with the light has odd inversion symmetry and thus can connect 
only two electronic configurations with different inversion symmetries, which 
are determined by the sum of all individual angular momentum quantum 
numbers. As a result of this rule, transitions between terms coming from the 
same electronic configurations are not allowed. 
As the simple examples of the atomic spectroscopy, some major results for 
the spectroscopy of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal atoms [ 31] are briefly 
described below.254 8 Many Electron Systems and Atomic Spectroscopy
Alkali Metals The emission spectra of alkali metal atoms consist of four series: S 
(sharp, s → p), P (principal, p → s), D (diffuse, d → p), and F (fundamental, 
f → d). Only one electron is involved in these transitions and the selection rules 
are similar to those for hydrogen atoms. That is, n is unrestricted, l = ±1, and 
J = 0, ±1 except that J = 0 ↔ J = 0 is forbidden. Note that J = 0 can be 
consistent with l = ±1 due to the interplay of the spin state except when J = 0. 
The principal series in the sodium atom result from the transitions, n 2P1/2 →
3 2S1/2 and n 2P3/2 → 3 2S1/2, wheren ≥ 3. The lowest of these are called sodium 
D lines, which have the wavelengths of 589.592 nm and 588.995 nm. 
Helium and Alkaline Earth Metal Atoms In the ground state where the two electrons 
are in the same s-type orbital, the total spin state is singlet. However, when one 
electron is excited and thus there are two nonequivalent electrons, both singlet 
and triplet states are possible. However, the triplet excited states are not optically 
accessible from the ground state because of the following selection rules: S = 0. 
That is, only singlet-singlet and triplet-triplet transitions, with l = ±1 for the 
promoted electron, are allowed. 
8.3 Case Study of Helium Atom 
This section provides a detailed mathematical description of independent electron 
model and then more advanced self-consistent field (SCF) approximation for the 
case of helium atom. 
8.3.1 Hamiltonian and Schrödinger Equation 
The full Hamiltonian for a helium atom is given by 
HˆHe = − h¯

. (8.26) 
Working in terms of the center of mass and relative coordinates in this case is 
mathematically complicated. Thus, using the fact that mc >> me, let us assume 
that the nucleus is fixed at the origin and that the kinetic energy of the nucleus can 
be ignored. With this assumption, the following Hamiltonian for the electrons in 
helium atom can be used:

where r12 = |r1 − r2|. Then, let us introduce ψHe,e(r1, r2) as the eigenfunction 
of the above Hamiltonian that satisfies the following time independent Schrödinger 
equation: 
HˆHe,elψHe,e(r1, r2) = EψHe,e(r1, r2). (8.28) 
The two-electron wave function ψHe,e(r1, r2) is defined in the six dimensional 
space of the two electron coordinates r1 and r2, and provides full information on 
the electrons within the helium atom under the assumption that the nuclear kinetic 
energy, the contribution of which is extremely small, can be ignored. Unfortunately, 
no exact solution has been found even for this simplest example of the multi-electron 
system. Thus, one has to rely on approximation methods. 
8.3.2 Independent Electron Model with Variational 
Optimization of Effective Charge 
Let us consider the simplest independent electron model that assumes ψHe,e(r1, r2)
as the product of two eigenfunctions for hydrogen-like systems. For this, it is useful 
to divide the Hamiltonian as follows [ 1]: 
HˆHe,el = HˆH,Z=2(1) + HˆH,Z=2(2) + e2
4π0

r12
, (8.29) 
where HˆH,Z=2(1) and HˆH,Z=2(2) represent the Hamiltonian of a single electrons 1 
and 2 around a nucleus of charge Z = 2 at the origin, respectively, and are expressed 
as 
HˆH,Z=2(j ) = − h¯

with charge Z at the origin is 
HˆH,Z = − h¯

Similarly, the eigenfunction ofHˆH,Z, which depends on the three quantum numbers 
as detailed in Chap. 6, is given by 
ψn,l,ml(r, θ , φ) = Rnl(r)Y ml
l (θ , φ), (8.34) 
where Y ml
l (θ , φ) is the spherical harmonics andRnl(r) is the radial function defined 
as

is an associated Laguerre polynomial as 
defined in Chap. 6. 
Now let us consider the following trial wave function: 
φ0(r1, r2) = ψ1s(Z, r1)ψ1s(Z, r2) . (8.36) 
where ψ1s(Z, r) is the 1s eigenfunction for the hydrogen-like system with nuclear 
charge Z, a parameter to be determined later, and is given by 
ψ1s(Z, r) = ψ100(r) =

Z3
π a3

e−Zr/a0 . (8.37) 
Then, it is easy to show that

(8.39)8.3 Case Study of Helium Atom 257
As is clear from Eq. ( 8.39), φ0(r1, r2) cannot be an eigenfunction HˆHe,e even 
when Z = 2 because of the last electron-electron repulsion term. In fact, Z = 2 is 
not expected to be the best choice considering that the electron-electron repulsion 
term causes partial screening of the nuclear charge. According to the variational 
theorem as described in Chap. 7, the best choice of Z is the one that minimizes the 
expectation value of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, let us first calculate the following 
expectation value: 
Eφ =

φ0(r1, r2) = 5Z

Thus, employing the above expressions and the definition of a0 given by Eq. (8.33), 
one can express the expectation valueEφ as follows [1]: 
Eφ = − h¯

. (8.43) 
Equation (8.43) shows that the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is a 
quadratic function of Z. Thus, it becomes minimum for the value of Z that satisfies 
the following condition: 
∂E
∂Z = h¯

which results in Zopt = 27/16. This implies that the electron-electron repulsion 
can be seen as screening the charge of the nucleus by 5/16. Using this value in 
Eq. (8.43), we find that the best estimate for the ground state electronic energy of 
the helium atom within the present approximation is

8.3.3 Self Consistent Field (SCF) Approximation for Helium 
As a preliminary step for a general description of SCF approximations, let us use 
the helium atom as an example and go through approximations involved in this 
approach in more detail [ 1]. In order to clarify the main ideas in this approach, let 
us now use the atomic and Gauss units where h¯ = me = a0 = e = 1. Then, the 
expression for the electronic Hamiltonian of the helium atom can be expressed as

Let us assume that the two electron wavefunction can once again be expressed as 
a product of single electron wavefunctions as follows: ψ(r1, r2) = ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2), 
which are assumed to be normalized. Then, 
E[ψ1.ψ2] = 

dr2ψ∗(r1, r2)Hψ( ˆ r1, r2) = I1[ψ1] + I2[ψ2] + J12[ψ1, ψ2],

them. Thus,

dr1 ψ∗
1 (r1)V eff
12 (r1)[ψ2]ψ1(r1). (8.52)

dr1ψ∗

1
r12
ψ1(r1), (8.53)8.3 Case Study of Helium Atom 259
which is an effective potential energy that electron 2 experiences due to electron 1 
and is also a functional of ψ(r1). Then, 
J12[ψ1, ψ2] = 
dr2 ψ∗
2 (r2)V eff
21 (r2)[ψ1]ψ2(r2). (8.54) 
Finally, let us introduce an effective total potential for electron 1, 
V1(r1)[ψ2]=−
2
r1
+ V eff
12 (r1)[ψ2], (8.55) 
and define an effective one-electron Hamiltonian for particle 1, 
Hˆ1[ψ2]=−
1
2
∇2
1 + Vˆ
1(r1)[ψ2]. (8.56) 
Then, we can define an effective one-electron wavefunction that satisfies the 
following Schrödinger equation: 
Hˆ1[ψ2]ψ1(r1) = E1[ψ1, ψ2]ψ1(r1), (8.57) 
where the fact that E1[ψ1, ψ2] is a functional of both ψ1 and ψ2 according to the 
following identity has been used. 
E1[ψ1, ψ2] = 
dr1ψ∗
1 (r1)Hˆ1[ψ2]ψ1(r1) = I1[ψ1] + J12[ψ1, ψ2]. (8.58) 
Similarly, we can also introduce an effective total potential for electron 2 as follows: 
V2(r2)[ψ1]=−
2
r2
+ V eff
21 (r2)[ψ1], (8.59) 
and define the Hamiltonian and effective one-electron Schrödinger equation for the 
wavefunction for particle 2 as follows: 
Hˆ2[ψ1]=−
1
2
∇2
2 + Vˆ
2(r2)[ψ1], (8.60) 
Hˆ2[ψ1]ψ2(r2) = E2[ψ1, ψ2]ψ2(r2). (8.61) 
Then, 
E2[ψ1, ψ2] = 
dr2ψ∗
2 (r2)Hˆ2ψ2(r1) = I2[ψ2] + J12[ψ1, ψ2]. (8.62) 
Equations (8.57) and (8.61) are effective single electron equations, and constitute 
the major equations to be solved. It is important to note that these are different 
from conventional one particle Schrödinger equations because the terms constituting260 8 Many Electron Systems and Atomic Spectroscopy
the Hamiltonian depend on the choice of as yet undetermined wavefunction. Thus, 
these have to be solved in a self consistent manner. For example, one can start from 
the first guess of the wavefunctions and then continue iterations. One important 
point to recognize in conducting such iterations is that the two effective one-electron 
wavefunctions are not independent but are coupled together as follows: 
ψ(0)
2 (r2) → V eff
12 (r1)[ψ(0)
2 ] → Hˆ1[ψ(0)
2 ] → ψ(1)
1 (r1) →··· (8.63) 
ψ(0)
1 (r1) → V eff
21 (r2)[ψ(0)
1 ] → Hˆ2[ψ(0)
1 ] → ψ(1)
2 (r2) →··· (8.64) 
This procedure can continue until E1 and E2 being determined converge. Note that 
the total energy is not equal to the sum of orbital energies. Rather, it is given by 
E = I1 + I2 + J12 = E1 + E2 − J12, (8.65) 
where the last term accounts for the electron-electron repulsion that is double 
counted when the two orbital energies are added up. 
The SCF approximation described above is known as the Hartree approximation 
and in general produces a better solution than simply assuming an eigenfunction for 
a hydrogen-like system for the single electron wavefunction. Of course, the actual 
performance of this approach depends on the choice of basis functions used for 
expanding the single electron wavefunction. 
One important issue that was not considered so far is the symmetry requirement 
for the final solution since the total two-electron wavefunction should be antisym￾metric with respect to the exchange of the two electrons. Assuming that the two 
electrons occupy the same orbital, ensuring such symmetry requirement is easy. One 
simply needs to assume that ψ(k)
1 (r) = ψ(k)
2 (r) throughout the iteration procedure 
and use the singlet spin state. However, if more than two electrons and one orbital 
are involved, such procedure can be cumbersome. Thus, it is best to devise a method 
that satisfies the symmetry requirement.

where the second line defines hj , the single electron term of the Hamiltonian 
representing its kinetic energy and potential energy with the nucleus, and rjk =
|rj − rk| with rj and rk respectively denoting the coordinates of electrons j and k. 
The corresponding quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator can be expressed as 
Hˆel =

Let us denote anNe-electron eigenstate ofHˆel with eigenvalueENe as |Ne .
1 Thus, 
Hˆel|Ne  = ENe |Ne . (8.70) 
It is straightforward to extend the independent electron model and the SCF 
approximation that have been detailed for the helium atom to find approximations 
for the above many-electron Schrödinger equation. In the description below, we go 
back to the Dirac notation for more compact presentation of formulation. 
8.4.1 Hartree Approximation 
The Hartree approximation can easily be extended to the general n electron state. 
For this, let us introduce single electron states, |ψ1(1), ··· , |ψNe (Ne), where ψk
denotes the kth spin orbit state and the argument inside of this is the label of each 
electron. Thus, each of the single electron state represents the electron 1 in state 
ψ1, the electron 2 in state |ψ2, and so on. Let us also assume for now that the Ne￾electron state can be expressed as the direct product of the single electron states as 
follows:2 
|Ne =|ψ1(1)⊗|ψ2(2)⊗···⊗|ψNe (Ne)
= |ψ1(1)|ψ2(2)···|ψNe (Ne). (8.71)
1 Although there are many eigenstates, which all have to be labeled with appropriate indices, we 
do not consider them now but focus only on one of them, particularly, the ground electronic state 
here. 
2 Apparently, this state is not consistent with the fact that all electrons are equivalent let alone it 
does not satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. 262 8 Many Electron Systems and Atomic Spectroscopy
Within this approximation, following a similar procedure as in the helium atom, the 
Hartree approximation for the total energy can be expressed as follows: 
ENe [ψ1, ··· , ψNe ]
= ψ1(1)|···ψNe (Ne)|
⎛
⎝
Ne
j=1
hˆ j +

j=1
⎛
⎝Ij [ψj ] +

j=k
Jjk[ψj , ψk]
⎞
⎠, (8.72) 
where 
Ij [ψj ]=ψj (j )|hˆ j |ψj (j ), (8.73) 
Jjk[ψj , ψk]=ψj (j )|ψk(k)|
1 
rˆjk
|ψj (j )|ψk(k). (8.74) 
In above expressions, those in the square brackets denote their functional depen￾dences. In other words,ENe depends on the choice of all of|ψ1(1), ··· , |ψNe (Ne), 
Ij only on the choice of |ψj (j ), and Jjk on the choice of the two states |ψj (j )
and |ψk(k). From now on, for notational conveniences, these dependences will be 
omitted. 
On the other hand, let us introduce the following effective one-electron Hamilto￾nian operator: 
Hˆj = hˆ j +
k=j
Jjk|ψj (j )ψj (j )|, (8.75) 
where the second term represents the potential of electron j due to others and is 
based on the assumption that each of electron j is in the state |ψj (j ), which is 
yet undetermined. Now, let us assume that |ψj (j ) can be determined to be the 
eigenstate ofHˆj with eigenvalueEj as follows: 
Hˆj |ψj (j ) =
⎛
⎝hˆ j +
k=j
Jjk
⎞
⎠ |ψj (j ) = Ej |ψj (j ). (8.76) 
Then, taking the inner product of the above equation with ψj (j )|, we obtain the 
following expression for the energy of electron j : 
Ej = Ij +
k=j
Jjk, (8.77)8.4 Self Consistent Field (SCF) Approximation for Many Electron Atoms 263
where the definition of Eq. ( 8.73) has been used. The total energy of the Ne￾electron system, Eq. (8.72), can thus be expressed using the above definition of 
single electron energy as follows: 
ENe = 
Ne
j=1
Ej − 1
2

Ne
j=1

k=j
Jjk. (8.78) 
Equations (8.76)–(8.78) serve as the formal framework for the iteration proce￾dure in the Hartree approximation, and one can continue the following procedure 
until convergence inENe is reached. 
1. Choose the initial guess states for |ψ(0)
1 (1), ··· , |ψ(0)
Ne (Ne). 
2. Determine hˆ j and Jjk using the states determined in step (1). 
3. Solve the one electron Schrödinger equation, Eq. ( 8.76), with hˆ j and Jjk
determined from step (2), which results in the next approximation for states, 
|ψ(1)
1 (1), ··· , |ψ(1)
Ne (Ne). 
4. Repeat the procedures (2) and (3), until convergence is reached in the energy 
determined by Eq. (8.78). 
Although the procedure of iteration within the Hartree approximation, as 
sketched above, is a powerful method applicable to general many-body problems, in 
practice, it is not applicable to actual many-electron systems because the resulting 
solution is not guaranteed to satisfy the symmetry requirement. Unlike the case with 
the helium atom that has only two electrons, it is not straightforward to check or 
ensure the symmetry requirement separately from the iteration procedure. 
8.4.2 Hartree-Fock Approximation 
The Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation is similar to the Hartree approximation 
except that it ensures that the symmetry property is satisfied by considering trial 
states that meet the symmetry condition at the outset. A well-known expression 
for the many-electron state as a linear combination of the products of single 
electron states, which satisfies the antisymmetry property, is the following Slater 
determinant:

where Pˆ represents a permutation operation of 1, ··· , 2Nr electron indices and 
NP is the number of pairwise permutations constituting a given permutation. 3 It 
is straightforward to show that the above definition satisfies the antisymmetric 
property with respect to any exchange of two electron indices. Since φk’s correspond 
to orbitals for the same atom, the following orthonormality relation holds: 
φk(l)|φj (l) = δkj . (8.82)

, (8.89) 
where the negative sign for the second term within the curly bracket reflects the 
antisymmetric property of the Slater determinant, given by Eq. ( 8.81). In other 
words, this terms results from the component of the 1/rˆμν operator between a 
particular component of the 2Nr-electron product in the bra of Eq. ( 881) and 
another term of the ket where two electrons μ and ν have switched their states. 
The resulting ket should have an opposite sign from that of the bra state because 
they are different by one pairwise exchange of two electrons. The second equality 
in Eq. (8.89) reflects the fact that the two integral terms involving μ and ν are 
independent of particular choice of these indices. Thus, 2Nr(2Nr −1) of such terms 
can all be replaced with the one with μ = 1 and ν = 2. 
Note that each single electron state is a spin-orbit state. In other words, for j =

Having demonstrated the validity of Eq. ( 8.84), let us now consider its relation￾ship with the single electron picture. For this, let us consider the following effective 
single electron Hamiltonian operator:

2Jˆ

Then, taking inner product of the above equation with φp(1)|, we obtain the 
following expression: 
Ep = Ip +
Nr
q=1
(2Jpq − Kpq ). (8.103) 
This is the energy of each orbital. In this expression, 2 Jpq is the regular Coulomb 
interaction term representing interactions with other electrons. The factor of 2 in 
this term accounts for the contributions of both spin up and down states. On the 
other hand, −Kpq represents purely quantum mechanical interaction that comes 
from exchange of two electrons. This is nonzero only when the two electrons are 
in the same spin state. Note that the interaction between two electrons in the same 
orbital, Jpp, is also included in Eq. ( 8.103), for which Kpp = Jpp. With the above 
expression, the HF energy can be expressed as follows:

convergence inEH F is reached.8.5 Summary and Questions 269

Although the above HF approximation accounts for the effect of many electrons 
on average, it misses the effects of correlation between different electrons, which 
requires going beyond the assumption of trial state as a single Slater-type deter￾minant. The approach of assuming the state as a linear combination of multiple 
determinants is usually called multi-configuration methods. Another important 
effect that is missing in the HF approximation described above is the spin-orbit 
interaction and/or relativistic effect, which become important for heavy atoms. 
8.5 Summary and Questions 
For many-electron atoms, the corresponding time independent Schrödinger equa￾tions cannot be solved exactly. However, due to the spherical symmetry of the 
system having only one nuclear center and the Pauli exclusion principle that leads 
to substantial reduction of repulsive interactions between electrons, it is possible to 
come up with an approximate scheme that is simple enough to offer good physical 
insights into many-electron atoms. The simplest of this kind is the independent 
electron model that assumes that the collection of many-electron states can be 
viewed as filling up electrons one by one on top of others according to the Aufbau 
(Building-up) principle that prescribes putting electrons in single electron orbitals 
that are available and have the lowest possible energies. 
Within the independent electron model, the degeneracy of the single electron 
orbitals for the same value of the principal quantum number is lifted because the 
effective electron-nuclear potential, even though it remains centrally symmetric, 
is no longer in Coulombic form. In general, orbitals with smaller orbital angular 
momentum quantum number l have lower energy than those with higher l for the 
same principal quantum number n. This is because the former tends to penetrate 
better into the region closer to the nucleus than the latter. While these energy 
differences between different values of l are small compared to the principal energy 
differences for small n, the two become comparable as n becomes large. This results 
in unique properties of transition metal elements, lanthanides, and actinides. 
For many electron atoms, the sum of total orbital angular momenta of electrons 
and total spin of electrons remains conserved and the corresponding quantum 
number, normally called J , serves as a good quantum number. For the case where 
the spin-orbit interactions are small, which remains a good approximation except for 
heavy atoms, the total orbital quantum number L and the total spin S serve as nearly270 8 Many Electron Systems and Atomic Spectroscopy
good quantum number and can be effectively used to specify different electronic 
states. With proper consideration of the Pauli exclusion principle that forbids having 
two electrons in the exactly the same spin-orbit states, it is possible to come up with 
all distinctive states that can be specified by the values of L, S, and J . Then, relative 
orders of these states can be determined according to the application of Hund’s rules 
and Lande’s interval rule. 
Selection rules for the atomic spectroscopy of many atoms can be understood on 
the basis of terms classified according to the values of L, S, and J and employing 
the fact that the interaction with the radiation is through the dipole operator, which 
causes the change of L at most one and leaves S to remain unchanged. The fact 
that the dipole operator has odd inversion symmetry also leads to Laporte’s rule for 
allowed transitions. 
More quantitative description of many-electron states can be conducted by 
applying the variational principle in a self-consistent way. The simplest of this 
is called the Hartree approximation, which however does not take the symmetry 
property of many electron states into consideration. A proper approach that also 
accounts for the Pauli-exclusion principle is the HF approximation. This serves 
as fairly accurate method of calculating many electron states although it does not 
account for correlation effects of many electrons and other effects that require more 
advanced theories.

Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular 
Spectroscopy 
We have sought for firm ground and found none. The deeper we 
penetrate, the more restless becomes the universe; all is rushing 
about and vibrating in a wild dance. 
– Max Born 
Abstract This chapter provides a general quantum mechanical account of poly￾atomic molecules, and describes the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that allows 
calculation of adiabatic electronic states for fixed nuclear coordinates. Taking 
diatomic molecules as examples, independent electron model and the approximation 
of linear combination of atomic orbitals as molecular orbitals (LCAO-MO) are 
described, and the molecular term symbols for corresponding electronic states are 
explained. As the next example, the LCAO-MO approximation with additional 
assumptions due to Hückel is used to describe electronic states of π-conjugated 
molecules. The chapter then provides a brief overview of the group theory and its 
applications for constructing MOs and analyses of vibrational spectroscopy. 
The Hamiltonian operator for a polyatomic molecule with Nu nuclei and Ne
electrons consists of two terms as follows: 
HˆM = Hˆnu + Hˆen, (9.1) 
where Hˆnu represents the nuclear kinetic and potential energies, and Hˆen represents 
the kinetic and potential energies of electrons. The potential energy of electrons 
includes both electron-nuclei interactions and those between electrons. In atomic

In Eq. (9.2), Mc, Pˆ c, Rˆ c, and Zc are the mass, momentum operator, position operator, 
and charge of the nucleus labeled as c. In Eq. (9.3), pˆμ and rˆμ are the momentum 
and position operators of the electron labeled as μ. 
Let us denote the eigenstate of the above molecular Hamiltonian HˆM as |M, 
for which the time independent Schrödinger equation is 
HˆM|M = (Hˆnu + Hˆen)|M = EM|M. (9.4) 
Solving the above equation is challenging even numerically. In particular, the large 
disparity of the masses of electrons and nuclei make it difficult to come up with 
common length and energy scales applicable to both of them. Thus, due to both 
conceptual and numerical reasons, it is much more beneficial to treat them at 
different levels. The standard approach for this is the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) 
approximation that treats nuclear motions adiabatically and ignores the coupling 
between electron and nuclear kinetic energies as described in detail below. 
9.1 Born-Oppenheimer Approximation 
Let us denote the whole set of nuclear coordinates as R = (R1, ··· , RNu ) and 
the corresponding position state bra of the nuclear coordinates as R|. Taking inner 
product of this with Eq. ( 9.4), we obtain 
R|HˆM|M=R|Hˆnu|M+R|Hˆen|M = EMR|M. (9.5) 
In the above expression, the nuclear term involving Hˆnu can be calculated using 
Eq. (9.2) and is expressed as

On the other hand, the term involving Hˆen in Eq. (9.5) can be simply expressed as 
R|Hˆen|M = Hˆen(R)R|M, (9.7) 
where Hˆen(R) is the same as Eq. ( 9.3) except thatRˆ is replaced withR as follows:

. (9.8) 
Equation (9.8) represents the Hamiltonian for electrons with fixed nuclear coor￾dinates as parameters. Let us now define adiabatic electronic states as eigenstates of 
this Hamiltonian. Thus, 
Hˆen(R)|ψe,a(R) = Ee,a(R)|ψe,a(R), (9.9) 
where a denotes the index specifying different adiabatic electronic eigenstates for 
the fixed nuclei. 
Before moving to the next step, it is worthwhile to note the parametric depen￾dence of Eq. (9.9) on the nuclear coordinates R = (R1, ··· , RNu ). As indicated, 
both the eigenstates and eigenvalues depend parametrically on R. Although not 
shown, in fact, even the index a depends implicitly on R. As a consequence, two 
different adiabatic states for two different nuclear coordinates are not in general 
orthogonal as indicated below. 
ψe,a(R
)|ψe,a(R) = 0. (9.10) 
Once we have specified an adiabatic electronic state |ψe,a(R), let us assume 
that the inner product of R| with the total molecular wavefunction |M can be 
expressed as1 
R|M = ψnu,a(R)|ψe,a(R). (9.11) 
The implication of the above expression is that the molecular state at R is defined 
by electrons in the particular adiabatic state |ψe,a(R), whereas the wavefunction 
for nuclei isψnu,a(R). Employing Eq. (9.11) in Eq. (9.7), we obtain 
Hˆen(R)R|M = Hˆen(R)ψnu,a(R)|ψe,a(R) = ψnu,a(R)Hˆen(R)|ψe,a(R),
(9.12) 
where the second equality results from the fact that Hˆen(R) does not involve 
any derivative with respect to nuclear coordinates. On the other hand, employing
1 More generally, one can consider a linear combination of these. 278 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy

(9.13) 
In the above equation, due to the dependence of the electronic state |ψe,a(R) on the 
nuclear coordinates, derivatives with respect to nuclear coordinates entail couplings 
between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom as follows:

In principle, the molecular Schrödinger equation, Eq. ( 9.5), can be solved by 
employing Eq. (9.13) including all the derivative coupling terms as indicated above. 
However, this is computationally challenging, and is not necessary typically because 
the first and second terms in the righthand side of the above equation are very small 
compared to the first term. The BO approximation is to ignore these small terms 2 
and to employ the following simplification: 
∇2
c (ψnu,a(R)|ψe,a(R) ≈ |ψe,a(R)∇2
c ψnu,a(R). (9.15)

The above equation implies that the electronic Schrödinger equation, Eq. ( 9.11), 
can be solved for all values (practically only for important region) of R, from 
which the electronic energy Ee,a(R) for each of the eigenstate can be determined. 
Combination of this with the nuclear potential energy leads to the following full BO

9.2 Molecular Orbitals and Electronic Configurations 
for Diatomic Molecules 
This section provides more detailed consideration of diatomic molecules, as the 
simplest examples of polyatomic molecules. The electronic Hamiltonian and 
Schrödinger equation based on the BO approximation are presented in detail. A 
simple molecular orbital theory for approximating these electronic states [ 1] is 
summarized, which offers clear understanding of important qualitative features 
observed for these systems.

Although the above Hamiltonian corresponds to the simplest electronic Hamiltonian 
of all polyatomic molecules, it is not amenable for an analytic solution. Thus, 
approximations are needed. As in the case of many-electron atoms, where the 
solution for hydrogen atom serves as a good basis for constructing states for many 
electrons, one can use the electronic states for H+
2 , for which exact analytic or 
reasonably good approximations exists, as a useful basis for constructing states for 
two or many electrons. The simplest approximation of this nature is called the linear 
combination of atomic orbitals as molecular orbital (LCAO-MO). 
Within the LCAO-MO approximation, MOs are approximated as linear combi￾nations of atomic orbitals. For example, for the ground electronic state of H+
2 , where 
there is a single electron, one can assume the following form for the MO: 
| = CA|1SA + CB|1SB, (9.23) 
where 1SA and 1SA respectively represent the 1s orbital for a hydrogen atom 
centered atRA and RB. Employing the variational principle, as described in Chap. 7, 
we can obtain the following matrix equation for CA and CB:

Similarly,

In the above expressions, J (R) represents the Coulomb interaction between the 
electron in orbital1SA (or 1SB) and the nucleus B (or A). 
From Eq. (9.30), it is clear that J (R) + 1/R > 0 always. On the other hand, 
K(R) represents stabilization energy due to sharing of an electron between two 
orbitals and is always negative. Therefore, E+(R) < E−(R) for all values of R.

Fig. 9.2 Energy diagrams of two LCAO-MO states formed by 1S orbitals 
Figure 9.1 illustrates the two orbitals |ψ+ and |ψ−. Because both of these 
states are cylindrically symmetric around the internuclear axis, they are called σ
orbitals. Note that |ψ+ does not have any nodal plane in between A and B and 
is thus symmetric with respect to inversion, whereas |ψ− has a nodal plane and 
is antisymmetric. Therefore, the former is denoted as 4 |σg1s while the latter as5 
|σu1s. 
Figure 9.2 shows the energy diagram of |σg1s and |σu1s states. As is alluded 
from the figure, the lowering of Eg = E+(R) from that of the atomic state is less 
than the relative increase of Eu = E−(R). This can in fact be proved directly.

Thus, the amount of destabilization of energy in anti-bonding orbital is more than 
the amount of stabilization in bonding orbital. 
9.2.2 Molecular Orbitals and Electronic Configurations 
of Diatomic Molecules 
LCAO-MOs can be constructed for all other diatomic molecules in a manner similar 
to those for H2 described in the previous subsection. Within the independent electron 
model, one can then construct the electronic configuration by filling electrons in 
available MOs, up to two electrons per each orbital so as not to violate the Pauli 
exclusion principle. An important quantity indicating the stability of each electronic 
configuration is its bond order defined below. 
Bond Order (B.O.) 
Given the electronic configuration, the bond order (B.O.) can be calculated as 
defined below. 
Bond Order (B.O.) = 1
2 {(# of electrons in bonding orbitals)
−(# of electrons in anti-bonding orbitals)}9.2 Molecular Orbitals and Electronic Configurations for Diatomic Molecules 285
Let us consider the examples of diatomic molecules in the first row. For the case 
of H2, the electronic configuration is (σg1s)2 and the B.O. is 1. On the other hand, 
for He2, the electronic configuration is (σg1s)2(σu1s)2 and the B.O. is 0. Because 
of Eq. (9.45), the total energy of electrons for He2 is higher than the sum of He, even 
within the approximation of independent electrons. Therefore, He2 is energetically 
unfavorable and is not formed. 
For the specification of electronic configurations of diatomic molecules with 
more electrons thanHe2, it is necessary to consider additional MOs formed by other 
types of atomic orbitals. For 2 s atomic orbitals, the MOs that can be formed are 
similar to those from 1s orbitals, and are denoted asσg2s and σu2s. 
The MOs formed by the three 2 p orbitals can be classified into two different 
groups. The2pz orbitals formσ orbitals as follows: 
|σg2pz ∝ (|2pz,A−|2pz,B), (9.46) 
|σu2pz ∝ (|2pz,A+|2pz,B). (9.47) 
Note that the bonding orbital in this case is formed by the difference (instead of 
the sum) of the two 2pz atomic orbitals. This way, the two has the same phase in 
the region between the two nuclei. Bonding and anti-bonding orbitals that can be 
formed by the two atomic orbitals are illustrated in Fig. 9.3. 
On the other hand,px and py orbitals formπ MOs as follows: 
|πu2py  ∝ (|2py,A+|2py,B), (9.48) 
|πu2px  ∝ (|2px,A+|2px,B), (9.49) 
|πg2py  ∝ (|2py,A−|2py,B), (9.50) 
|πg2px  ∝ (|2px,A−|2px,B). (9.51) 
These π MOs have one nodal planes that contain the internuclear axis as illustrated 
in Fig.9.4. The bonding orbital has u symmetry and the anti-bonding has g
symmetry. The axis perpendicular to the internuclear axis can be either x or y axis. 
Thus, there are twoπ MOs for each type of bonding and anti-bonding. 
In general, σ interactions are stronger than π interactions because electrons are 
more localized along the internuclear axis for the former. Therefore, it is expected

that σg2pz bonding orbital has lower energy thanπu2px,y and thatσu2pz has higher 
energy than πg2px,y . However, for diatomic molecules ranging from Li2 through 
N2, the relative order of bonding orbitals is switched. Thus, σg2pz has higher energy 
than πu2px,y for these molecules. This is an outcome of repulsive interactions from 
electrons already occupying the σu2s orbital, which destabilizes the σg2pz orbital 
because they have significant overlap along the internuclear axis. Figure 9.5 shows 
the MO energy diagram reflecting this effect. The ground electronic configurations 
that are obtained by filling up electrons according to the molecular building-up 
principle are listed in Table 9.1.9.2 Molecular Orbitals and Electronic Configurations for Diatomic Molecules 287

and F2. The electrons filled in 
represent the configuration of 
O2
On the other hand, for O2 and F2, the original order is restored and the σg2pz
orbital has lower energy than πu2p orbitals. This is because large nuclear charges 
of these molecules cause large enough separation of energy levels between the 
σu2s and σg2pz orbitals compared to their electron-electron repulsion effect. The 
resulting MO diagrams, with all electrons for O2 filled, are shown in Fig. 9.6. For 
the case of F2, the additional two electrons fill up the πg2p orbitals. The ground 
electronic configurations for these are also listed in Table 9.1. 
Having defined the MOs, as depicted in Figs. 9.5 and 9.6, and identified the 
electronic configurations of diatomic molecules as summarized in Table 9.1, it is 
important to assess the validity and accuracy of the approximations involved. To 
this end, photoelectron spectroscopy and Koopmans’ theorem play important roles, 
which are summarized below.288 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Photoelectron Spectroscopy 
Photoelectron spectroscopy is the molecular version of the photoelectric effect 
where a photon of large enough energy is absorbed by a molecule and an 
electron is released from the molecule. Due to the energy conservation, the 
following relationship holds for a photoelectron spectroscopy: 
hν¯ ph = 1
2
mev2 + Ii, (9.52) 
where νph is the frequency of the photon being absorbed by the molecule, 
v is the speed of the ejected electron, and Ii is the ionization energy of the 
molecule. 
Koopmans’ Theorem 
According to Koopmans, the ionization energy can be approximated well by 
the negative of the orbital energy as follows: 
Ii ≈ −Ei, (9.53) 
where Ei is the energy of the orbital the electron is ejected from. 
Combination of Eqs. (9.52) and (9.53) provide direct means to experimentally 
determine the energies of MOs. Indeed, these experimental results have confirmed 
the validity of the MOs and configurations for diatomic molecules described above. 
Ionization energies of molecules are typically several electron volts even for valence 
electrons, for which photon with wavelength less than 200 nm is typically needed. 
So far, only homonuclear diatomic molecules have been considered. For het￾eroatomic diatomic molecules, if atomic numbers are not significantly different, 
similar MO levels can be used. However, even in this case, the notation g or u cannot 
be used any more because the molecule no longer has the inversion symmetry. The 
magnitudes of coefficients contributing to LCAO-MOs are different as well. Other 
than that, the order of MO energy levels and the building-up principle remain intact. 
For example,CO and CN− have the following ground electronic configuration: 
KK(σ2s)2(σ∗2s)2(π2p)4(σ∗2pz)
2,
for which the B.O. is 1.9.2 Molecular Orbitals and Electronic Configurations for Diatomic Molecules 289
For diatomic molecules formed by those with significantly different atomic 
numbers, different types of MOs have to be used because only atomic orbitals 
with similar energies and proper symmetries form significant molecular orbitals. 
For example,HF has the following electronic configuration: 
(1sF )
2(2sF )
2(1σ )2(2pxF )
2(2pyF )
2
While the LCAO-MO approximation still provides simple understanding that is 
useful, in reality, actual MOs being formed become complicated once interactions 
among all the electrons and perturbation by other MOs are taken into consideration. 
Still, the notations forσ, π, ··· can be used since the molecules remain cylindrically 
symmetric. Thus, more generally, instead of specifying the atomic orbitals consti￾tuting MOs within the simplest LCAO-MO approximation, the MOs are labelled by 
numbers of increasing order. For example, F2 has the following configuration: 
(1σg)
2(1σ∗
u )
2(2σg)
2(2σ∗
u )
2(3σg)
2(1πu)
4(1π∗
g )

9.2.3 Molecular Electronic States of Diatomic Molecules 
All the diatomic molecules have cylindrical symmetry, for which Lˆ z (with the z
axis defined as the direction of internuclear axis) commutes with the molecular 
Hamiltonian. Therefore, the eigenvalue of Lˆ z serves as a good quantum number, 
and can be used to label the electronic states of all diatomic molecules. For this, 
, the absolute value of the eigenvalue of Lˆ z divided by h¯, is used. In other words, 
states with  have ±h¯ as eigenvalues of Lˆ z. For  = 0, this is a single state. 
For  = 0, this represents doubly degenerate states. These different states, along 
with other important properties, can be represented compactly by molecular term 
symbols that are introduced below. 
Molecular Term Symbols 
The following molecular term symbol is used to express the electronic states 
of diatomic molecules: 
2S+1M±
g(u),
where M is one of capital Greek letters, , 	, 
,  for  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 
respectively. In the left superscript, S is the total spin quantum number of 
electrons. In the right subscript, g is used for a state with even inversion 
symmetry and u is used for a state with odd inversion symmetry. In the right 
(continued)290 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
superscript, + means even reflection symmetry and − means odd reflection 
symmetry with respect to a plane containing the internuclear axis. 
For the case of singly occupied MOs, it is easy to find the corresponding 
term symbols because the state has the same symmetry as the MO and the spin 
multiplicity is always 2. Below are examples: 
(σg)
1 → 2+
g
(σu)
1 → 2+
u
(πu)
1 → 2	u
(πg)
1 → 2	g
For the case of fully occupied MOs, the spin multiplicity is 1 and the electronic 
state is totally symmetric. Thus, all of (σg)2, (σu)2, (πg)4, and(πu)4 have the same 
term, 1+
g . For the case of one less than fully filled MOs, the term is the same as 
singly occupied MOs. This is because, the former can be viewed as that of a single 
hole (absence of electron) which has to obey the same property as the electron as 
far as the molecular term symbols are concerned. 
For the case where two electrons occupy the same orbitals, for example, as in 
(πg)2 or (πu)2, care should be taken in identifying all possible term symbols that 
are consistent with the Pauli principle. A simple way to figure out all possible terms 
is to consider the sum of the pair of single electron angular momentum and spin 
values, lz and sz. For example, for an electron occupying the π molecular orbital, 
the following four pairs exist. 
a :

1,
1
2

b :

−1,
1
2

a :

1, −1
2

b :

−1, −1
2

Then, all possible values for the total Lz and Sz of the two electrons occupying the π
orbitals can be found by summing all distinctive pairs of (lz, sz). Considering only 
the positive values of these, we obtain the following four cases of (, S): 
a + a : (2, 0) a + b : (0, 1)
a + b : (0, 0)
a + b : (0, 0)9.2 Molecular Orbitals and Electronic Configurations for Diatomic Molecules 291
In the above list, the case with  = 2 and S = 0 corresponds to a term with 
1
g. Here, the subscript g is used because two electrons occupying the same orbital 
always have even symmetry with respect to inversion regardless of the symmetry 
of individual MOs. In the remaining three pairs, (0, 1) and (0, 0) represent the case 
with  = 0 and S = 1. These apparently represent triplet states. For this to be 
true, the MO should be an antisymmetric combination of the product of two single 
electron π orbitals, which is expected to have odd reflection symmetry with respect 
to a plane containing an internuclear axis. Therefore, these correspond to 3−
g . 
The remaining pair corresponds to the case of  = 0 and S = 0. Since the spin 
state is antisymmetric, the orbital in this case has to be a symmetric combination 
of two atomic π orbitals, for which the reflection symmetry with respect to a plan 
containing the internuclear axis is even. Therefore, this corresponds to 1+
g . 
Compiling all the results obtained so far, we find that both (πg)2 and (πu)2 have 
the following three different terms: 
3−
g , 1
g, 1+
g .
Note that the terms above are listed in the order of increasing energy according 
to Hund’s rules.6 In other words, the states with higher spin multiplicity have lower 
energies. Among the states with the same spin multiplicity, the states with the higher 
value of have lower energies. 
For two electrons in two different orbitals, all possible combinations of  and 
S can be used without restriction. For example, for an excited configuration of H2, 
(1σg)1(1σu)1, the following two terms exist: 
3+
u , 1+
u ,
where the two terms are listed in the order of increasing order of energy according to 
Hund’s rules. For an excited state configuration of N2,(1πu)3(3σg)2(1π∗
g )1, there 
are four possible terms, and they can be written in the order of increasing energy 
according to Hund’s rules as follows: 
3
u, 3±
u , 1
u, 1±
u .
Transitions between the electronic states of diatomic molecules due to absorption 
or emission of a single photon occur according to well known selection rules. More 
generally, one can identify a set of selection rules for electronic states of linear 
molecules as described below.
6 For molecular electronic states, Hund’s rules are less reliable than atomic electronic states. 292 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Selection Rules for Electronic Transitions of Linear Molecules 
• 
 = 0, ±1: This is because the total orbital angular momentum number 
of all electrons L can change only by ±1 or remain the same, for which
can change only by±1 at most or remain the same. 
• 
S = 0: This is because the spectroscopy involves interaction of the 
electric filed part of the radiation, which does not interaction with spins 
and thus leaves the total spin of electrons intact. 
• There is no transition between + and − states: This is because the 
transition dipole moment interacting with the radiation is always along 
the direction of the internuclear axis due to the cylindrical symmetry. This 
means that the transition dipole has positive reflection symmetry and thus 
cannot couple any two states with different reflection symmetries. 
• Only transitions between u and g symmetries are allowed: In other 
words, transition between states with the same inversion symmetries is not 
allowed. This is because the transition dipole has u symmetry and thus can 
couple only states with different inversion symmetries. 
9.3 Conjugated Hydrocarbons and Hückel Approximation 
The simple LCAO-MO approximation can be useful for qualitative understanding 
of π-type electronic states formed by pz orbitals in hydrocarbons with conjugated 
double bonds. In fact, one can make further simplifications known as Hückel 
approximation as described below. 
Hückel Approximation 
For π-type molecular orbitals formed bypz orbitals (p orbitals perpendicular 
to C − C bonding), the following three approximations can be made. 
• All the overlap integrals between different pz orbitals are zero. 
• All the diagonal elements of the electronic Hamiltonian with respect to pz
orbitals are assumed to be the same as follows: 
Hii = 2pzi|Hˆen|2pzi = α. (9.54) 
• All the off-diagonal elements of the electronic Hamiltonian between 
different pz orbitals are assumed to be zero except for those due to the 
(continued)9.3 Conjugated Hydrocarbons and Hückel Approximation 293
nearest neighbors, which are also assumed to be the same as follows: 
Hii+1 = 2pzi|Hˆen|2pzi+1=2pzi+1|Hˆen|2pzi = β. (9.55) 
9.3.1 Ethylene 
As the simplest example, let us consider ethylene, for which the π-ype LCAO-MO 
formed by the twopz orbitals can be expressed as 
|ψπ  = C1|2pz1 + C2|2pz2. (9.56) 
Application of the variational principle described in Chap. 7 for the above state leads 
to the following matrix equation:

where H11 = pz1|Hˆen|pz1, H22 = pz2|Hˆen|pz2, Hˆ12 = pz1|Hˆen|pz2, and 
S12 = pz1|pz2. Based on the Hückel approximation, H11 = H22 = α and H12 =

 = (α − E)2 − β2 = (α − E − β)(α − E + β) = 0. (9.58) 
Therefore, there are two possible solutions, E = α ± β. 
For the case ofE = α + β, solving Eq. (9.57) results in 
− βC1 + βC2 = 0. (9.59) 
This, along with the normalization condition, means that C1 = C2 = 1/
√2. For the 
case ofE = α − β, solving Eq. (9.57) results in 
βC1 + βC2 = 0. (9.60) 
This, along with the normalization condition, means that C1 = −C2 = 1/
√2. These 
results for ethylene are summarized below.294 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy

9.3.2 Butadiene 
As the next example, let us consider butadiene. For this case, theπ−MO constructed 
from the linear combination of four pz orbitals is expressed as 
|ψπ  = C1|2pz1 + C2|2pz2 + C3|2pz3 + C4|2pz4. (9.63) 
Then, application of the variational principle and Hückel approximation leads to the 
following equation for E and theCk:

Since β is negative, the energies given above are in the decreasing order. 
Employing the corresponding value of x for each case in Eq. ( 9.66), we can 
obtain the corresponding MOs. For this, it is useful to rearrange the linear equations 
for Ck’s. First, note that Eq. ( 9.64) is equivalent to the following equations: 
C1x + C2 = 0, (9.71) 
C1 + xC2 + C3 = 0, (9.72) 
C2 + xC3 + C4 = 0, (9.73) 
C3 + C4x = 0. (9.74) 
Adding Eqs. (9.72) and (9.73), we obtain 
C1 + (1 + x)C2 + (1 + x)C3 + C4 = 0. (9.75) 
Subtracting Eq. (9.73) from Eq. (9.72), we also obtain 
C1 + (x − 1)C2 + (1 − x)C3 − C4 = 0. (9.76)296 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
From Eqs. (9.71) and (9.74), we find thatC2 = −xC1 and C3 = −xC4. Substituting 
these forC2 and C3 in Eqs. (9.75) and (9.76), we obtain the following two different 
equations involvingC1 and C4. 
C1(1 − x − x2) + C4(1 − x − x2) = 0, (9.77) 
C1(1 + x − x2) − C4(1 + x − x2) = 0. (9.78) 
For the cases of x = (
√5 + 1)/2 and x = −(
√5 − 1)/2, 1 + x − x2 = 0 and 
Eq. (9.78) is already satisfied. Therefore, using Eq. ( 9.77), we find that C1 = −C4. 
On the other hand, for the cases of x = (

√5 + 1)/2, 
1 − x − x2 = 0 and Eq. (9.77) is already satisfied. Therefore, using Eq. ( 9.78), we 
find that C1 = C4. As a result, we obtain the following four MOs corresponding to 
the four values of the energy for butadiene.

9.3.3 π Orbital and Delocalization Energies 
Having obtained theπ-MOs, let us now consider theπ orbital energies of electrons 
within the independent electron model. The ground electronic state is obtained by 
filling in two electrons from the lowest possible π-MOs.9.4 Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory 297
For the case of ethylene, the two valance electrons from pz atomic orbitals can fill 
the lowest energyπ-MO with energyα + β. Thus, theπ orbital energy for ethylene 
is 
Eπ (ethylene) = 2(α + β) = 2α + 2β. (9.79) 
On the other hand, for butadiene, there are four valance electrons coming from pz
atomic orbitals. These can fill in the two lowest energy π-MOs, for which the energy 
is equal to 
Eπ (butadiene) = 2

Note that theπ orbital energy for butadiene is different from twice the π electron 
energies of ethylene. The difference between the two accounts for the additional 
stabilization due to conjugation (or delocalization) of neighboring π-MOs and 
accounts for the stability ofπ-conjugated molecules as summarized below. 
π-Bonding Delocalization (or Conjugation) Energy 
The π bonding delocalization energy is the difference of the total π-orbital 
energy from the sum of those for isoelectronic ethylenes. For the case of

9.4 Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory 
9.4.1 Symmetry and Symmetry Operation 
Symmetry plays an important role in quantum mechanics. It allows determination 
of the nature of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and classifying them without going 
through detailed calculations. For molecular systems, consideration of symmetry 
in particular enables constructing MOs in an efficient manner and identifying the 
nature of vibrational modes, both with the help of the group theory [ 9–13]. We 
begin this section with more exact definition of symmetry and related terms as listed 
below.298 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Symmetry and Related Terms 
• Symmetry: An object is called to have symmetry if it remains equivalent 
(appears to look the same) after certain operation. 
• Symmetry operation: An operation that is intended to test whether an 
object has symmetry or not is called symmetry operation. 
• Symmetry element: A geometrical object with respect to which a symme￾try operation is performed. 
The two definitions of symmetry and symmetry operation seem somewhat 
circular, but it is important to note that the former is the property of a specific 
object whereas the latter can be applied to any object. Thus, a symmetry 
operation can be defined independent of objects it is being applied to. It only 
requires existence of a symmetry element with respect which the operation is 
performed. 
Symmetry operation is also a physically well-defined operation, which can also 
be viewed as a quantum mechanical operator with proper definition of its action on 
either physical observables or states. The fact that a molecule has certain symmetry 
is equivalent to stating that the Hamiltonian for the molecule commutes with the 
corresponding quantum mechanical symmetry operator. This important fact will be 
detailed further later. In many cases, the same symbol is used for symmetry operator 
and symmetry element, which often becomes the source of confusion between the 
two. Therefore, operator notation is used here for the symmetry operation. 
Out of all possible symmetry operations, we will focus here only on point 
symmetry operations, which leave at least one point of the object being operated 
on unchanged. Point symmetry operations are the only kinds of operations needed 
for the specification of intrinsic properties of molecules. Let us first review the basic 
types of point symmetry operations as listed below. 
Point Symmetry Operations 
There are five types of symmetry operations [ 9] that form the basis for all 
point symmetry operations as listed below. 
• Identity operation, Eˆ, is doing nothing, and does not have any symmetry 
element associated with it. 
• Inversion operation, ˆi, is an inversion with respect to an inversion center. 
If the inversion center is origin, this operator transforms (x, y, z) to 
(−x, −y, −z). Application of this operation twice becomes the identity 
operation as follows:ˆi2 = ˆi · ˆi = Eˆ. 
(continued)9.4 Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory 299
• Proper rotation, Cˆn, is an operation that rotates around an axis (denoted as 
Cn axis) by 2π/n and is called n-fold proper rotation operation. Note that 
applying this operator n times leads to the identity operation as follows: 

Cˆn
n
= Cˆn · Cˆn ····Cˆn   
n times
= Eˆ
• Reflection operator, σˆ , reflects a point or body with respect to a plane 
of reflection. For example, if the plane of reflection is the xy-plane, 
this operation transforms a point (x, y, z) to (x, y, −z). If the plane 
of reflection is yz-plane, the operation transforms a point (x, y, z) to 
(−x, y, z). When both Cˆn’s and σˆ ’s coexist in a group of symmetry 
operations, the reflection plane that contains Cn axis with the highest value 
of n is denoted as σv. On the other hand, the plane perpendicular to Cn is 
denoted asσh. 
• Improper rotation, Sˆ
n, is a combination of a proper rotation and a 
reflection with respect toσh, the plane perpendicular to the proper rotation 
axis Cn. Thus,Sˆ
n = ˆσhCˆn = Cˆnσˆh. Note that the two operators σˆh and Cˆn
commute with each other. The symmetry element of the improper rotation 
is denoted as Sn, which is in fact the same as Cn. If Sn is equal to the 
z-axis, this operation transforms a point (x, y, z) to (x
, y
, −z), where 
x = cos(2π/n)x − sin(2π/n)y and y = sin(2π/n)x + cos(2π/n)y. 
This operation transforms every point except the origin where Cn axis 
and σh intersects. There are a few important properties of Sˆ
n. Application 
of improper rotation twice is equal to that of proper rotation as follows: 
Sˆ
n · Sˆ
n = ˆσ2
h · Cˆ 2
n = Cˆ 2
n. This is because Cˆn and σˆh commute with each 
other. Therefore, if n is even, Sˆn
n = Eˆ. On the other hand, if n is odd, 
Sˆn
n = ˆσh. It is also important to note that Sˆ
2 = ˆi. Therefore, the smallest 
value of n for Sˆ
n, which is distinctive from others, is n = 3. 
9.4.2 Group Theory 
Mathematically, a group is defined by a set of group elements, which can be finite 
or infinite, and a rule of mapping called group multiplication, which combines any 
pair of group elements and produces another one [ 9, 10].300 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Definition of Group 
Let us denote group elements of a group G as A, B, C, ··· , and the 
group multiplication as ◦. Then, the set of elements and the multiplication 
constituting G should satisfy the four properties described below. 
1. If A and B are elements of G, then A ◦ B and B ◦ A are also elements of 
G. 
2. There is an identity element E in the group such that A ◦ E = E ◦ A = A
for any A inG. 
3. The group multiplication ◦ is associative. In other words, (A ◦ B) ◦ C =
A ◦ (B ◦ C) for any A, B, and C Gin . Note that the multiplication does 
not have to be commutative. In other words, A ◦ B does not the have to be 
the same as B ◦ A. In case the group multiplications are commutative for 
all elements of a group, such a group is called an Abelian group. 
4. For any group element A in the group G, there is always a unique inverse 
of A, which is denoted as A−1, such thatA ◦ A−1 = A−1 ◦ A = E. 
There are various finite and infinite groups. For example, the set of integers can 
be shown to be a group by defining addition (+) as the group multiplication. A well￾known finite group is the set of integers mod n (remainder after division), where n
is an arbitrary positive integer. The group multiplication in this case is defined as 
the sum of two integers mod n. For example, for n = 3, the group elements are 0, 
1, and 2, and the results of group multiplications of these elements are as follows: 
0 ◦ 1 = 1 ◦ 0 = 1, 0 ◦ 2 = 2 ◦ 0 = 2, 1 ◦ 2 = 2 ◦ 1 = 0. Thus, 0 is the identity 
element for this group, and the inverse of 1 (2) is 2 (1). Both of these groups are 
Abelian groups. 
Important Terms and Concepts in Group Theory 
• Order, is the total number of elements of a group, which will be denoted 
as Q here, and can be either finite or infinite. 
• Group multiplication table, is a Q × Q table that specifies the results of 
the group multiplication of all pairs of group elements. 
• Conjugate elements: Two elements A and A of a group are called 
conjugate if they are related by the following similarity transformation: 
A = B ◦ A ◦ B−1, where B is any element in the group and B−1 is its 
inverse. If this relationship holds, A ◦ B = B ◦ A. 
• Class: The set of all conjugate elements in a group is called a class. For an 
Abelian group, each element forms its own class since A ◦ B = B ◦ A for 
any A and B. 
(continued)9.4 Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory 301
• Representation, refers to any group composed of concrete mathematical 
entities that are homomorphic (many-to-one mapping from represented 
elements to the original group element) or isomorphic (one-to-one map￾ping) to the original abstract group that can be completely specified by the 
group multiplication table. 
• Matrix representation, is the representation where each group element is 
represented by a square matrix and the group multiplication is the matrix 
multiplication. 
• Equivalent matrix representations: Two matrix representations and 
of a group are called equivalent if there is an invertible matrix S relating 
the two for all matrix representations of the group as follows: 

(Ai) = S−1(Ai)S, for i = 1, ··· ,Q , (9.82) 
where Ai’s represent all the elements of the group with order Q. 
9.4.3 Groups of Point Symmetry Operations 
Certain sets of point symmetry operations can form group. In a group of point 
symmetry operations, the group elements are symmetry operations and the group 
multiplication of two “elements” is defined as successive application of the two 
operations, with the convention that the one on the righthand side is always applied 
first. These groups can be classified according to what symmetry operations generate 
the entire elements of a group and are listed in the Table 9.2, mploying Schönflies 
notation. For example, the groupCnv consists ofEˆ, Cˆn, and n different σv’s and all 
others that can be generated from them such as Cˆ k
n with k = 2, ··· , n − 1. 
In Table 9.2, note that there are no S2n−1 points groups. The reason for this 
is as follows [9]. If there were a group called S2n−1, it should be generated by the 
corresponding improper rotation operationSˆ
2n−1. This means that such a group also 
should haveSˆ2n−1
2n−1 = ˆσh, which also implies that it should have Cˆ2n−1 = ˆσhSˆ
2n−1 as 
its group element. However, such a group has already been classified as the C2n−1h
group. Since we do not want duplicate notations for the same group, the customary 
practice is to assume that onlyS2n groups exist. 
The groups fromT to Ih in Table 9.2 are called cubic point groups. Among these 
point groups, Td , Th, Oh, and Ih exactly have the same symmetries of tetrahedron, 
cube, octahedron, and icosahedron, respectively. 
Typically, it is stated that a given molecule belongs to a certain point group if its 
structure (in the ground electronic state) remains unchanged with respect to all the 
symmetry operations constituting the point group. For example, it is easy to show 
that H2O belongs to the C2v point group and benzene C6H6 belongs to the point302 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Table 9.2 Point groups and their respective generating operators. Except for the first three point 
groups, where all the generators form a complete group, there are additional symmetry operators 
being generated by those listed, which altogether form a complete set of symmetry operations

group D6h. If this is the case, The importance of the point group of a given molecule 
is that the Hamiltonian within the BO approximation, Eq. ( 9.18), commutes with 
all the symmetry operations of the group, which also means that it is possible to 
determine simultaneous eigenstates of both the Hamiltonian and all the symmetry 
operators of the group. This can be used to identify symmetry adapted LCAO-MOs 
and also for identifying IR and Raman activity of molecular vibrational modes. 
If a molecule is polar, it belongs to only one of Cn, Cs, andCnv. This is because 
a given polar molecule should have nonzero permanent dipole moment. Since the 
permanent dipole should be invariant with respect to all the symmetry operations 
constituting the group that the molecule belongs to, the dipole vector should be 
contained in the intersection of all symmetry elements defining the group operations. 
This is possible only if all symmetry operations share at least one line on which 
the permanent dipole vector lies. For this to be true, there should be no inversion 
center or planes perpendicular to Cn. The three groups listed above are the only 
such groups having this property.9.4 Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory 303
9.4.4 Matrix Representation of Point Symmetry Group 
Elements 
For groups consisting of point symmetry operations, representation of each group 
element (symmetry operation) by a square matrix is a convenient choice. Different 
matrix representations are possible depending on the choice of the basis set, but 
there are certain quantities that remain invariant and play important roles for 
defining more universal properties. One such quantity is called character of the 
matrix representation. 
Character 
The character of a matrix representation, which is denoted as χ here, refers 
to the trace, namely, the sum of all the diagonal matrix elements, of the matrix. 
The characters of two matrix representations are always the same if they are 
related by a unitary transformation. 
For example, let us consider a basis consisting of three cartesian coordinates. 
Then, the symmetry operations Eˆ, Cˆ2, σˆv, and σˆ 
v constituting the C2v point group 
can be represented as follows:

For the matrix representations of the four symmetry operations constituting the C2v
group, the characters are as follows: χ (E)ˆ = 3, χ (Cˆ2) = −1, χ (σˆv) = 1, and 
χ (σˆ 
v) = 1. 
Note that all the four matrix representations for the above C2v group are diagonal, 
which means that they can be represented by the properties of each one dimensional 
component. The matrices shown are examples of reducible representation and each 
of x, y, and z components here are considered as irreducible representations. More 
exact definitions of these are provided below. 
Reducible and Irreducible Representations 
• A given matrix representation of a group is called reducible if all the 
matrices representing the symmetry operations of the group can be reduced 
to smaller block diagonal or fully diagonal forms by the same similarity 
transformation, which means that there exists an invertible matrix Sˆ such 
that for any Aˆ in the group, Aˆ = SˆAˆSˆ−1, where Sˆ−1 is the inverse of Sˆ, 
becomes a matrix consisting of smaller diagonal blocks. 
• A representation is called irreducible if all the matrices cannot be reduced 
to smaller block diagonal or fully diagonal forms by any similarity 
transformation. 
• For a given point group, there is a unique set of all distinct irreducible 
representations. 
Each irreducible representation can be fully characterized by the set of characters 
of symmetry operations constituting a group. For example, for the representation 
of the C2v group shown above, each component x, y, and z corresponds to an 
irreducible representation with the following characters. 
Eˆ Cˆ2 σˆv σˆ 
v Irrep.
x 1 −1 1 −1 B1
y 1 −1 −1 1 B2
z 11 1 1 A1
In the above table, the right column shows the conventional notation for the 
three one dimensional irreducible representations. A fairly complete description of 
notations for irreducible representations is provided below.9.4 Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory 305
Notations for Irreducible (Irrep.) Representations 
The main symbols denoting the irreducible representations of finite point 
groups are A, B, E, and T . Each of these symbols is described below. 
• A: One dimensional and symmetric with respect to Cˆn of the highest n. 
• B: One dimensional and antisymmetric with respect to Cˆn of the highest 
n. 
• E: Two dimensional. 
• T : Three dimensional. 
Each symbol can further classified with subscripts as described below. 
• 1 (subscript): Symmetric with respect to the Cˆ2’s around C2 axes that are 
perpendicular toCn of the highest n or σv’s. 
• 2 (subscript): Antisymmetric with respect to the Cˆ2’s around C2 axes that 
are perpendicular toCn of the highest n or σv’s. 
• g (subscript): Even inversion symmetry when there is ˆi operator in the 
group. 
• u (subscript): Odd inversion symmetry when there is ˆi operator in the 
group. 
In case the group has σˆh operation, each Irrep. is labeled with  or  as 
follows. 
• 
: Symmetric with respect toσˆh. 
• : Antisymmetric with respect toσˆh. 
Having introduced the notations for irreducible representations as detailed above, 
it is now possible to appreciate the implications of a character table for a point group. 
Let us consider, for example, the full character table for C2v as follows: 
C2v Eˆ Cˆ2 σˆv σˆ 
v
A1 11 1 1 z, x2, y2, z2
A2 1 1 −1 −1 xy, Rz
B2 1 −1 1 −1 x, xz, Ry
B2 1 −1 −1 1 y, yz, Rx
Each row in the above table represents a one dimensional irreducible representation, 
for which only ±1 is possible as the character. The value 1(−1) implies that the 
representation is symmetric (antisymmetric) with respect to the symmetry operation. 
The right column shows linear or quadratic functions of Cartesian coordinates that 
have the same symmetry as the given irreducible representation. Rx , Ry , and Rz
represent rotations around x, y, and z axes.306 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
In the above table for the C2v point group, the number of irreducible represen￾tations is the same as the order of the group, Q = 4. This is because each element 
belongs to a different class and all irreducible representations are one dimensional. 
This is not always the case. For example, let us consider the C3v group, which 
consists of the following symmetry operations: 
Eˆ,Cˆ 3,Cˆ 2
3, σˆ (1) v , σˆ (2) v , σˆ (3) v .
In the above list,Cˆ 3 and Cˆ 2
3 are related to each other, forming a class, and so do the 
three reflection operationsσˆ (1) v , σˆ (2) v and σˆ (3) v , which forms another class. Symmetry 
operations belonging to the same class have same values of characters for all the 
irreducible representations and thus can be grouped together in the character table. 
In other words, the character table for the C3v group can be expressed as follows: 
C3v Eˆ 2Cˆ3 3σˆv
A1 11 1 z, x2, y2, z2
A2 1 1 −1 Rz
E 2 −1 0 (x, y), (x2 − y2, xy), (xz, yz), (Rx , Ry )
In the above character table for C3v point group, there is a two dimensional 
irreducible representation, E. All the characters of this can be confirmed by 
considering how the two dimensional x and y coordinates are transformed as 
follows: 
x

Since 2 cos(2π/3) = 2 cos(4π/3) = −1, this confirms that the character for 2Cˆ3
is equal to -1. The character for Eˆ is equal to 2 because this is a matrix in two 
dimensional vector space. The character for σˆv is equal to zero as can be seen from 
its matrix representation. Note that the number of classes is equal to the number9.4 Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory 307
of irreducible representations. In addition, the order of C3v group, Q = 6, is also 
equal to 12 + 12 + 22, which is the sum of squares of the dimensions of all the 
irreducible representations. In fact, these relationships are true for C2v and for all 
the point groups. 
Relationships Between the Order, the Number of Classes, and the Num￾ber of Irreducible Representations 
• The number of classes is equal to the number of irreducible representations. 
• The order of a group Q is equal to the sum of squared dimensions of all 
irreducible representations. 
The importance of irreducible representations is that they can be regarded as an 
orthogonal basis in defining any representation. In other words, given a representa￾tion in a certain basis, the following decomposition always exists uniquely: 
 = 
P
k=1
ak
k, (9.87) 
where ak is a nonnegative integer,
k is an irreducible representation k embedded 
in the full dimension of  so that all other matrix elements except for the block of 
k are zero, and P is the total number of irreducible representations in the group. 
Thus, bothk and 
k have the same trace. 
An important theorem concerning the characters of irreducible representations is 
their orthogonality as stated below. 
Orthogonality Theorem 
Given two different irreducible representations j and k, the following 
relation holds: 
1
Q

Q
i=1
χj [Sˆ
i]
∗χk[Sˆ
i] = δjk, (9.88) 
where χj [Sˆ
i] is the character of the irreducible representation j for the 
symmetry operation Sˆ

orthogonality theorem given by Theorem 9.6, provided in the Appendix of 
this chapter, as described below. 
(continued)308 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
For the present case, the group elements G’s in Eq. (9.135) of the Appendix 
are symmetry operators,Sˆ
j ’s. Since the trace is given by 
χj [Sˆ
i] = 
lj

Dividing the above expression with Q, we obtain Eq. (9.88). 
Given the decomposition of a (reducible) representation  according to 
Eq. (9.87), the same relationship should hold for the character of any symmetry 
operation as follows: 
χ[Sˆ

where χ[Sˆ

operation Sˆ

symmetry operations of the group, Sˆ

we obtain

ak in the expansion, Eq. (9.87), can be obtained only from the information on the 
characters for all symmetry operations9.4 Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory 309
9.4.5 Application for Symmetry Adapted LCAO-MO 
Let us consider an example of water molecule, which belongs to the C2v group, and 
assume LCAO-MOs consisting of six atomic orbitals, 
|ψMO = CsA|SA+CsB|SB+csC|SC+cpx |px +cpy |py +cpz|pz, (9.93) 
where |SA and |SB are 1s orbital states of two hydrogen atoms, respectively 
denoted as A and B|, SC is the 2s orbital state of the central oxygen atom, |px , 
|py , and |pz are px , py , pz orbital states of the oxygen atom. The molecule is 
assumed to be in the yz-plane. Thus, xy-plane bisects the two hydrogen atoms. 
All the representations of the symmetry operators in this basis can be identified 
by finding out the outcomes of their actions on the vectors of six orbital states as 
described below. First, the representation of Cˆ2 operation is obtained by

Matrices shown above are matrix representations of the symmetry operations in 
the basis of the six atomic orbitals. Thus, including the identity operation, which is 
represented by a six dimensional unit matrix, one can calculate the characters for all 
the symmetry operations as listed in the table below. 
C2v Eˆ Cˆ 2 σˆv(xz) σˆ 
v(yz)
 6 0 2 4 
Using the orthogonality theorem, we can identify the coefficients for irreducible 
representations for the above reducible representation as follows: 
A1 :
1
4 (1 · 6 + 1 · 0 + 1 · 2 + 1 · 4) = 3
A2 :
1
4 (1 · 6 + 1 · 0 + (−1) · 2 + (−1) · 4) = 0
B1 :
1
4 (1 · 6 + (−1) · 0 + 1 · 2 + (−1) · 4) = 1
A2 :
1
4 (1 · 6 + (−1) · 0 + (−1) · 2 + 1 · 4) = 2
Therefore, we find that 
 = 3A1 + B1 + 2B2. (9.97) 
This implies that the MOs that are simultaneous eigenstates of the symmetry 
operations of theC2v group, which can be constructed out of the six atomic orbitals 
are three MOs with the symmetry of A1, one MO with the symmetry of B1, and two 
MOs with the symmetry ofB2. Due to the simplicity of water molecule, these MOs 
can be identified easily by inspection. 
Indeed, it is clear that the three MOs with A1 symmetry correspond to (|SA +
|SB)/√2, |SC, and |pz. The MO with B1 symmetry is the px orbital of oxygen 
and thus corresponds to |px . Two MOs with B2 symmetry are (|SA−|SB)/√2
and |pz. Note that these are not yet bonding or anti-bonding orbitals, but can 
be used to construct them easily because only MOs belonging to the same 
irreducible representations can be combined together. This implies that at least 
three bonding/anti-bonding MOs can be constructed from the three MOs with A1
symmetry and that bonding and anti-bonding MOs can be constructed from the two 
MOs with B2 symmetry. On the other hand, the single orbital with B1 symmetry, 
|px , is expected to remain as nonbonding. Figure 9.7 shows four MOs obtained 
from a HF calculation, and indicates that the simple analysis based on the group 
theory can indeed explain qualitative patterns of the lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and HOMO-1.9.5 Spectroscopy of Polyatomic Molecules 311

Their symmetry properties

9.5 Spectroscopy of Polyatomic Molecules 
Within the BO approximation, the eigenstates of the molecular Hamiltonian can 
be decoupled to electronic and nuclear parts as described in Sect. 9.1. Given that 
the potential energy surfacesVBO,a(R) can be determined by solving the electronic 
Schrödinger equation, Eq. (9.9), for all possible values of the nuclear coordinates, 7 
one can then obtain the Schrödinger equation for the nuclear degrees of freedom, 
Eq. (9.19). This Schrödinger equation can again be decomposed into translation, 
rotation, and vibrational components. In the absence of external potential, the 
translational components can be ignored. 
9.5.1 Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy 
As in the case of diatomic molecules, the selection rules for the IR and Raman 
spectroscopy are the same. In other words, 
v = ±1 in both cases. However, for 
general polyatomic molecules with many vibrational normal modes, determining 
which modes are IR and Raman active is not a simple task. The group theory and 
character table for each group is very helpful in this respect. 
Given a molecule, we can identify a point group with the maximum number 
of symmetry operations with respect to which the molecule remains invariant. 
Then, we can determine the characters for the reducible representation of all the
7 While this is possible in principle, it is almost impossible in practice for most polyatomic 
molecules. Thus, only partial information around local minima around the minimum of each 
electronic state is typically available. 312 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
coordinates for operations in the group. Application of the orthogonality theorem 
then allows determining the linear combination of irreducible representations. Once 
all the translational and rotational modes are subtracted, the IR active modes 
correspond to those that behave like x, y, and z. The Raman active modes 
correspond to those that behave like quadratic functions of the coordinates. 
Let us once again consider the water molecule as an example. For this, consider 
the representation of the symmetry operations in the nine dimensional cartesian 
coordinates consisting of x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, and z3, where the subscript 
1 denotes the coordinates of the oxygen and 2 and 3 denote the coordinates of two 
hydrogen atoms. In this basis, the character of the identity operator χ (E)ˆ = 9. The 
operation ofCˆ2 can be represented according to the following relation:

the reducible representation as listed in the table below.

Application of the orthogonality theorem then leads to

4 (9 − 1 + 1 + 3) = 3
A2 :

B1 :

4 (9 + 1 + 1 − 3) = 2

4 (9 + 1 − 1 + 3) = 3
Therefore, we find that 
 = 3A1 + A2 + 2B1 + 3B2. (9.101) 
Out of the above linear combinations, the translational motion of the molecule 
corresponds to tr = A1 + B1 + B2 and the rotational motion corresponds to 
rot = A2 + B1 + B2 according to the character table of C2v. Thus, subtracting 
these from given above, we obtain the following decomposition of the vibrational 
reducible representation: 
vib = 2A1 + B2. (9.102)314 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Fig. 9.8 Three vibrational modes of a water molecule 
Thus, there are two vibrational modes with A1 symmetry, which correspond to 
symmetric stretching and bending, and one vibrational mode with B2 symmetry, 
which is asymmetric stretching (see Fig. 9.8). Both of these symmetries contain 
those that are linear and quadratic in the cartesian coordinates. Therefore, they are 
both IR and Raman active. 
9.5.2 Electronic Spectroscopy 
In general, the electronic spectroscopy involves transition between electronic states 
due to the interaction between the electric field part of the radiation and the 
following full dipole operator involving electrons,

Nu
c=1

rˆν

, (9.103) 
where the Zc and Rˆ c are nuclear charges and position operators and the rˆν are 
the position operators of the electron ν. Thus, in general, the electronic transition 
involving one photon is allowed as long as the following transition dipole vector is 
nonzero. 
Dtr
if = f |Dˆ T (rˆ, Rˆ )|i, (9.104) 
where |i and |f  refer to initial and final molecular states including both 
electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Let us assume that the initial and final 
states can be approximated as the product of electronic states and nuclear wave 
function in respective BO surfaces as follows:

In many electronic transitions, it turns out that the integration of the dipole 
operator with respect to the electronic degrees of freedom can be approximated in 
terms of the following electronic transition dipole vector calculated for a reference 
nuclear coordinate:

ψei(r; R0), (9.108) 
where R0 is the reference nuclear coordinates that are typically assumed to be 
the coordinates for the minimum of the initial electronic state and the second 
equality results from the fact that the two electronic states determined for the 
nuclear coordinateR0 are orthogonal to each other. This is so called Franck-Condon 
approximation, and the resulting approximation for the total transition dipole vector 
is as follows: 
Dtr
if ≈ De

where the overlap integration of the nuclear wavefunction is nonzero in general 
because they are defined with respect different structures and is known as the 
Franck-Condon factor. 
For electronic absorption spectroscopy, the initial state is the ground electronic 
state (labeled as X) and the transition occurs to an electronic state with the same spin 
multiplicity as the ground state (labeled as A, B, C, etc) and with nonzero value of 
the electronic transition dipole vector given by Eq. ( 9.108). For small molecules 
where all the vibrational frequencies are much larger than thermal energy, ψnui(R)
can be approximated well by the product of ground state vibrational wave functions 
of all the vibrational normal modes. 
For the case of radiative electronic emission spectroscopy, normally called 
fluorescence, the initial state is one of the excited electronic states ( A, B, C, etc), 
which has the same spin multiplicity as the ground electronic state (X). In this case 
as well, if the vibrational frequencies in the excited electronic state are much larger316 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
than the thermal energy, the initial nuclear wave function can be approximated well 
by the product of ground vibrational state wave functions of all normal modes in the 
excited electronic state potential energy surface. 
Although fluorescence is the dominant mechanism of transitions of excited 
electronic state, there are other non-radiative transitions that can occur as well. If 
the non-radiative transition is between excited states of the same spin multiplicity, 
it is called internal conversion. If the transition occurs to states with different 
spin multiplicity (labeled as a, b, c, etc), it is called intersystem crossing. The 
mechanism of this intersystem crossing is spin-orbit coupling. Radiative transition 
from excited states with different spin multiplicity to the ground electronic state can 
occur although it is dipole forbidden. This process is called phosphorescence and 
typically takes microseconds and beyond. 
9.6 Summary and Questions 
Within the BO approximation, quantum states of polyatomic molecules can be 
treated in two stages. First, ignoring the kinetic energy of nuclei, the Schrödinger 
equation for electrons for fixed nuclei can be solved. Then, energies obtained 
from these calculations for all possible nuclear coordinates (in principle) can be 
incorporated into the potential energy for nuclei so as to describe the vibrational 
states of molecules. Although conceptually straightforward, even solving the equa￾tions for electrons alone involves challenging numerical issues, for which various 
approximation methods have been developed. 
One of the simplest approximations that can be used for obtaining electronic 
states in polyatomic molecules is to use LCAO-MOs and assume that electrons 
can be filled in independent of each other while satisfying the Pauli principle. 
This simple treatment leads to qualitatively correct description of small or sim￾ple molecules, helping to understand important molecular quantum mechanical 
details without going through numerical calculations. Representative examples are 
diatomic molecules of the second row, for which Table 9.1 sums up major results. 
Verification or further correction of the simple MO description can be made through 
photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with Koopmans’ theorem given by 
Eq. (9.53). 
Another important application of the LCAO-MO approximation is approximat￾ing π-orbital energies of conjugated hydrocarbons, for which additional Hückel 
approximation can also be made. This simple model has helped to understand 
the types of conjugated hydrocarbons that can be stabilized and also contributed 
to developing semi-empirical methods during early stages of electronic structure 
calculation method development. 
For the understanding and description of both electronic and vibrational states 
of polyatomic molecules, group theory has also provided important conceptual 
framework for understanding the symmetry of states and relevant selection rules. 
The success of the group theory relies on the fact that a set of symmetryAppendix: Important Theorems and Proofs in the Group Theory 317
operations that leave a certain molecule invariant can form a mathematical group. 
The properties of the group then can be employed to classify electronic and 
vibrational states of molecules. The most important theorem in such application 
is the orthogonality theorem, based on which efficient ways to construct MOs and 
to identify types of vibrational modes have been developed. In particular, for the 
vibrational spectroscopy, identification of irreducible representations and referral of 
the character table make it possible to determine IR and Raman active vibrational 
normal modes of a molecule. 
Questions 
• What are neglected in the BO approximation and when do they become 
significant? 
• Is it possible to use the LCAO-MO approximation to describe formation 
and breaking of chemical bonds? 
• The component of the total orbital angular momentum along the internu￾clear axis in a diatomic molecule is conserved. What is the reason for this? 
• The relative order of bonding σ and π orbitals for O2 and F2 are different 
from other diatomic molecules with smaller atomic numbers in the second 
row. What is the reason for this? 
• What are additional assumptions involved in the Hückel approximation in 
addition to the LCAO-MO approximation? 
• Koopmans’ theorem is known to be fairly accurate despite its simple 
expression and even though it does not account for electron correlation 
effects. What is the implication of this success? 
• When does a molecule have vibrational modes that are both IR and Raman 
active? 
• If a molecule belongs to a certain point group, all the symmetry opera￾tions constituting the point group commute with the Hamiltonian of the 
molecule. What is the reason for this? 
• What is the difference between reducible and irreducible representations 
in the group theory? 
Appendix: Important Theorems and Proofs in the Group 
Theory 
This appendix provides a complete set of theorems and proofs for obtaining the 
orthogonality theorem, Eq. (9.88). The theorems and proofs presented here are 
based on those presented by Tinkham [ 10], with some alternation in notations and 
additional clarifications.318 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Theorem 9.1 Rearrangement theorem: For any group G, the multiplication of any 
element of the group with all the elements of the group produce a complete set 
containing all the elements, where each element of the group appears only once. 
Proof Consider a set S consisting of all the group elements multiplied with X, 
which is also an element of the group. For convenience, assume that each element 
is multiplied with X on the right. 
Let us choose an arbitrary element of the group, say A. Then, the group G should 
contain B = A ◦ X−1 as its element because there should be an inverse of X in the 
group and the group is closed with respect to multiplication. Since B ◦ X = A, A
should appear at least once in the set S. Thus, (i) any group element of G should 
exist in the setS. 
Since S and the original set of G have the same number of elements, each 
element should appear only once in the set of products. Otherwise, there should 
be an element that cannot appear, which is contradictory with the statement (i). This 
completes the proof for the case where the elements are multiplied with X on the 
right. Similar proof is possible for the case where X is multiplied on the left by 
considering X−1 ◦ A. 
As a result of the above theorem, the following identity holds for any sum over 
all the elements of the group: 

k
F (Ak) = 
k
F (Ak ◦ X) = 
k
F (X ◦ Ak), (9.110) 
where F is an arbitrary function, Ak’s for all k constitute the complete set of element 
of the group, and X is an arbitrary element of the group. 
Theorem 9.2 Any matrix representation of a group is equivalent to a representation 
by a unitary matrix as long as determinants of all the matrices are nonzero. 
Proof Let us denote the matrix representing the ith element of the group as Ai, 
where i = 1, ··· , Q. Then, one can always construct the following Hermitian 
matrix: 
H = 
Q
i=1
AiA†
i , (9.111) 
where A†
i is the Hermitian conjugate ofAi. Therefore,H can be diagonalized toH
by a unitary matrixU as follows:

Therefore, all the diagonal elements of H are real and positive, and we can define 
H1/2 and H−1/2

I = H−1/2

Theorem 9.3 Any Hermitian matrix commuting with all matrices of an irreducible 
representation must be a constant matrix.320 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Proof Let us denote the Hermitian matrix that commutes with all matrices of a 
representation of a group asH. This implies that 
AiH = HAi, for i = 1, ··· , Q (9.117) 
Since H is Hermitian, there should be a unitary matrix U such that H = U†HU is 
diagonal. Then, applyingU† and U on the left and right side of the above equation, 
we obtain 
A
iH = H
A
i, (9.118) 
where A
i = U†AU = U−1AU. Taking the matrix element of the above relation and 
using the fact that theH has only diagonal elements, we obtain 
[A
i]nm[H
]mm = [H
]nn[A
i]nm, (9.119) 
which means that 
[A
i]nm 	
[H
]mm − [H
]nn

= 0. (9.120) 
If all the diagonal elements of H are the same, the above identity is satisfied. On the 
other hand, if [H
]mm − [H
]nn = 0 for some n = m, the above identity means that 
[A
i]nm = 0 for all i. This implies that the unitary transformation of Ai’s to A
i’s 
resulted in smaller blocks. However, this contradicts the assumption that Ai’s are 
irreducible, Therefore, all the diagonal matrix elements of H should be the same. 
Thus, H = cI, where c is an arbitrary constant, andH = cUIU† = cI. 
Theorem 9.4 Schur’s Lemma: Any matrix commuting with all matrices of an 
irreducible representation must be a constant matrix. 
Proof Let us denote the matrix that commutes with all matrices of a representation 
of a group asM. This implies that 
AiM = MAi, for i = 1, ··· , Q (9.121) 
Taking the Hermitian conjugate of the above relationship, we obtain 
M†A†
i = A†
i M†. (9.122) 
Then, by multiply Ai and Ai on the left and right side of the above expression, we 
obtain 
AiM†A†
i Ai = AiA†
i M†Ai. (9.123) 
According to Theorem 9.2, we can always find out a representation where all A’s 
are unitary by similarity transformation. Thus, let us define such a transformationAppendix: Important Theorems and Proofs in the Group Theory 321
matrix as S, which has inverse, and let A
i = S−1AiS. Then, multiplying S−1 and 
S on the left and right hand side of the above expression, and inserting 1 = S−1S
between every operator, we obtain 
A
iS−1M†SA
i
†
A
i = A
iA
i
†
S−1M†SA
i. (9.124) 
Since A
i’s are unitary, the above relation implies that 
A
iM† = M†
A
i, (9.125) 
where M = S−1M†S. On the other hand, applying the same similarity transforma￾tion to Eq. (9.121), we obtain 
A
iM = M
A
i, (9.126) 
Now, let us defined H1 = M + M† and H2 = i(M − M†
). Then, employing 
Eqs. (9.125) and (9.126), we find that 
A
iH1 = H1A
i, (9.127) 
A
iH2 = H2A
i, (9.128) 
for alli = 1, ··· , Q. According to Theorem 9.3, H1 and H2 are constant matrices. 
Therefore, M is constant matrix andM = SM
S−1 is also a constant matrix. 
Theorem 9.5 There are two irreducible matrix representations of the same group, 
(1)
(Ai) and (2)
(Ai), each with dimensionality l1 and l2. Let us assume that a 
rectangular matrix M exists such that 
M(1)
(Ai) = (2)
(Ai)M, (9.129) 
for all i = 1, ··· , Q. Then, the following is true. For l1 = l2, M = 0. For l1 = l2, 
either M = 0 or the determinant of M is nonzero, for which the two irreducible 
representations are equivalent. 
Proof Assume that all the irreducible matrices are unitary as well. If not, they 
can be transformed to unitary matrices according to Theorem 9.2. Then, taking the 
Hermitian conjugate of Eq. (9.129) and using the fact that the matrix representations 
are unitary, 
(1)
(A−1
i )M† = (1)
(Ai)
†M† = M†(2)
(Ai)
† = M†(2)
(A−1
i ). (9.130)322 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Multiplying the above expression withM on the lefthand side and using the fact that 
M(1)
(A−1
i ) = (2)
(A−1
i )M, which is a specific case of Eq. ( 9.129) for A−1
i , we 
obtain the following expression: 
M(1)
(A−1
i )M† = (2)
(A−1
i )MM† = MM†(2)
(A−1
i ). (9.131) 
Since the above relation holds for any A−1
i in the group, according to Theorem 9.4, 
the above relation implies that 
MM† = cI, (9.132) 
where I is the identity matrix of dimensionl1. 
If l1 = l2, Eq. (9.134) implies that the absolute square of the determinant of M
is equal to cl1 . For the case where c = 0, this implies that the determinant of M is 
nonzero. For the case where c = 0, considering the diagonal elements of Eq. (9.134), 
we find that 

n
[M]mn[M†]nm = 
n
|[M]mn|
2 = 0. (9.133) 
The above identity holds true only when all the matrix elements are zero. 
If l1 < l2, we can create a square matrix of dimension l2 by adding (l2 − l1)
columns of zeros toM. Then,NN† = MM†. Therefore, 
NN† = cI. (9.134) 
Since the determinant of N is zero, the above identity implies that c = 0. Then, the 
proof for the case ofl1 = l2 above can again be applied to show that N = 0. 
If l1 > l2, similar proof is possible by constructing a square matrix of dimension 
l1 by insertingl1 − l2 rows of zeros inM. 

which one can construct the following matrix: 
M = 
G
(k)(G)X(j )(G−1), (9.136)Appendix: Important Theorems and Proofs in the Group Theory 323
where (k)(G) is alk ×lk matrix, (j )(G−1) is alj ×lj matrix, andX is an arbitrary 
matrix with lk row and lj column. Then, for a certain element S of the group, it is 
straightforward to show the following identities: 
(k)(S)M = 
G
(k)(S)(k)(G)X(j )(G−1)

G

(k)(SG)X(j )((SG)−1)(k)(S)
= 
G
(k)(G)X(j )((G)−1)(k)(S) = M(k)(S). (9.137) 
In the last equality of the above equation, Theorem 9.1 was used. According to the 
Theorem 9.5, Eq. (9.137) implies that M = 0 for l1 = l2 or the two representations 
are not equivalent forl1 = l2. Thus, 
[M]nm = 0 = 
G

pq
[(k)(G)]npXpq [(j )(G)]qm. (9.138) 
Now, consider the case where the elements of the matrix X are zero except for 
the n
m element as follows: Xpq = δpnδqm. Then, the above relation becomes the 
following identity: 

G
[(k)(G)]nn[(j )(G)]mm = 0, (9.139) 
which completes the proof for the cases where lj = lk or the two representations 
are not equivalent whilelj = lk. 
Now, let us consider the case where the two representations are equivalent. Thus, 
let us drop the superscript j and k. Then, 
M = 
G
(G)X(G−1) = cI. (9.140) 
Therefore, considering themm element of the above identity, we obtain 

pq

G
[(G)]mp[X]pq [(G−1)]qm = cδmm. (9.141)324 9 Polyatomic Molecules and Molecular Spectroscopy
Let us consider the case where [X]pq = δpnδqn . Then,

Summing the above elements overm = m

Thus, there are the following three solutions for the energy: E = α, α − √2β, and

Quantum Dynamics of Pure and Mixed 
States 
Whatever Nature has in store for mankind, unpleasant as it may 
be, men must accept, for ignorance is never better than 
knowledge. 
— Enrico Fermi 
Abstract This chapter provides an overview of quantum dynamics and its approxi￾mations. For pure states that can be represented by a linear combination of kets/bras 
(or wavefunctions), this entails solving the time dependent Schrödinger equation. 
Three major pictures of the dynamics, Schrödinger picture, Heisenberg picture, and 
interaction picture are explained first. Then, the interaction picture is used for the 
description of time dependent perturbation theory, and Fermi’s golden rule is derived 
from the first order approximation. For the description of more general mixed states, 
introduction of density operator and extension of the time dependent Schrödinger 
equation to the quantum Liouville equation become necessary. Application of the 
perturbation theory to this quantum Liouville equation is presented as well. 
So far, the focus has been on stationary (time independent) properties of a closed 
quantum system and a pure quantum state that can be expressed by a single ket (bra) 
or wavefunction. While this has been enough for explaining the foundational aspects 
of quantum mechanics and applications to well-isolated molecular properties, it is 
limited for quantitative understanding of time dependent quantities and properties of 
a large collection of molecules that are interacting with each other. Most chemical 
phenomena involve understanding these dynamical processes in complex environ￾ments. For this, explicit consideration of quantum dynamics and general approaches 
to represent mixed states are necessary. This chapter describes basic principles 
governing the dynamics of pure and mixed states, and simple approximations.

10.1 Quantum Dynamics of Pure States 
A pure quantum state refers to any single quantum mechanical state that can be 
represented by a ket (bra) or a linear superposition of kets (bras). As described 
briefly in Chap. 2, for a closed quantum system with a Hamiltonian operator Hˆ , the 
pure state at time t can be determined completely by solving the time dependent 
Schrödinger equation, Eq. (2.43). Given that the initial state is |ψ, the solution of 
the time dependent Schrödinger equation can be expressed in terms of the time 
evolution operator UˆH (t) defined by Eq. (2.82). The resulting expression, Eq. (2.85), 
can again be expressed in a number of different ways as follows: 
|ψ;t = UˆH (t)|ψ = exp

|ψ. (10.1) 
In the limit of t = 0, the above expression approaches the limit of |ψ;t = 0=|ψ
as it should. 
Given the time dependent state as expressed above, the corresponding time 
dependent expectation value at time t of any physical observable Aˆ, which is 
assumed to be time independent for now, is equal to 
Aˆt = ψ;t|Aˆ|ψ;t. (10.2) 
While this view of the quantum dynamics is sufficient for describing all the time 
dependent processes in quantum mechanics and is most widely used, it turns out to 
be just one of many possible “pictures” of the dynamics known as the Schrödinger 
picture. In this picture, the time evolution of the system is viewed as being entirely 
due to the change of the state from |ψ to |ψ;t although there can still be an 
additional time dependence of an operator Aˆ due to extrinsic factors. To make this 
clear, let us denote the operator in the Schrdinger picture with subscript “ ¨ S” and also 
assume the possibility of additional time dependence that cannot be explained in 
terms of time evolving quantum states in the Schrödinger picture. Thus, the general 
time dependent expectation value of any time dependent physical observable can be 
expressed as 
A(t) ˆ t = ψ;t|AˆS(t)|ψ;t. (10.3)10.1 Quantum Dynamics of Pure States 333
Taking the time derivative, we find that the above time dependent expectation value 
satisfies the following differential equation:

10.1.1 Heisenberg Picture 
Heisenberg viewed that the dynamics is entirely due to time evolving physical 
observables whereas the state remains the same. This is known as the Heisenberg 
picture and can easily be shown to be equivalent to the Schrödinger picture. For 
any time dependent operator in the Schrödinger picture AˆS(t), we can define the 
following time dependent operator in the Heisenberg picture: 
AˆH (t) = Uˆ †
H (t)AˆS(t)UˆH (t). (10.5) 
Then, the expectation value of A(t) ˆ at time t can be viewed as the expectation of the 
above operator with respect to the time independent state |ψ as follows: 
A(t) ˆ t = ψ|AˆH (t)|ψ=ψ|Uˆ †
H (t)AˆS(t)UˆH (t)|ψ=ψ;t|AˆS(t)|ψ;t,
(10.6) 
where the second equality shows the equivalence of the two pictures. 
In the Heisenberg picture, all the time dependent properties are directly encoded 
into time evolving operators as if physical observables evolve in time in classical 
mechanics. This is represented by the time evolution equation for the time dependent334 10 Quantum Dynamics of Pure and Mixed States
operator as follows:

∂t
AˆS(t)
UˆH (t). (10.7) 
For the case where AˆS(t) commutes with the Hamiltonian Hˆ , it also commutes with 
the time evolution operator UˆH (t). For this case, AˆH (t) = AˆS(t), and the time 
derivative of AˆH (t) is the same as the partial derivative of AˆS(t) with respect to 
time. 
In the Heisenberg picture, the relationship between time dependent position and 
momentum operators are similar to those for classical mechanics. For this, let us 
consider the case of the following one dimensional Hamiltonian: 
Hˆ = pˆ2
2m + V (ˆ x). ˆ
Then, the time derivatives of the position and momentum operators in the Heisen￾berg picture are as follows:

UˆH (t) = Fˆ
H (t). (10.9) 
In the above expression, Vˆ 
(x)ˆ implies the derivative of the potential energy with its 
argument as the position operator and the fact that [ ˆp, f (x)ˆ ]=−ihf¯ 
(x)ˆ for any 
function of position f (x) has been used. Thus, Fˆ
H (t) is the time dependent force 
operator in the Heisenberg picture.10.1 Quantum Dynamics of Pure States 335
For the case of a harmonic oscillator with V (x) = mω2x2/2, the force operator 
is proportional to position as follows: Fˆ
H (t) = −mω2xˆH (t). Therefore, Eq. (10.9) 
reduces to 
d
dt pˆH (t) = −mω2xˆH (t). (10.10) 
This is exactly the same as the classical equation of motion for the momentum. 
Therefore, one can find out the solution for the time dependent position operators in 
terms of that for the classical mechanics as follows: 
xˆH (t) = ˆx cos(ωt) + pˆ
mω sin(ωt), (10.11) 
pˆH (t) = ˆp cos(ωt) − mωxˆ sin(ωt). (10.12) 
10.1.2 Interaction Picture and Time Dependent Perturbation 
Theory 
Let us consider the case where the system is subject to additional perturbation 
Hamiltonian, Hˆ1(t), which can be time dependent in general, in addition to the 
original zeroth order Hamiltonian, Hˆ0. Thus, the total Hamiltonian describing the 
system is given by 
H (t) ˆ = Hˆ0 + Hˆ1(t). (10.13) 
The time dependence of Hˆ1(t) may originate from any source, but the most typical 
one is the application of time dependent field. 
In the Schrödinger picture, the state evolves according to the following time 
dependent Schrödinger equation: 
ih¯
∂
∂t |ψ;t = H (t) ˆ |ψ;t = (Hˆ0 + Hˆ1(t))|ψ;t. (10.14) 
Given that the eigenstates and eigenvalues of Hˆ0 are known and that we want to 
develop perturbation theory with respect to Hˆ1(t), it is convenient to consider a 
Heisenberg picture with respect to Hˆ0. This is known as the interaction picture. 
Thus, let us introduce the time evolution operator for Hˆ0, 
Uˆ0(t) = exp 
− i
h¯
Hˆ0t

, (10.15)336 10 Quantum Dynamics of Pure and Mixed States
which represents the dynamics of a system subject to only the zeroth order 
Hamiltonian Hˆ0. Note that Uˆ0(t) is a unitary operator as follows: 
Uˆ0(t)Uˆ †
0 (t) = Uˆ †
0 (t)Uˆ0(t) = 1ˆ. (10.16) 
We can now define the state in the interaction picture by applying Uˆ †
0 (t) to |ψ;t
as 
|ψ;tI ≡ Uˆ †
0 (t)|ψ;t. (10.17) 
Then, the equation governing the time evolution of |ψ;tI is

where Eqs. (10.16) and (10.17) have been used and the following first order 
Hamiltonian in the interaction picture has been introduced. 
Hˆ1,I (t) ≡ Uˆ †
0 (t)Hˆ1(t)Uˆ0(t). (10.19) 
Integrating Eq. (10.18) with respect to time, we find that

The above expression is nothing but the integral equation form equivalent to 
Eq. (10.18) but is amenable for approximate solution more easily as detailed below. 
Both sides of Eq. (10.20) involve as yet unknown |ψ;tI at two different times. 
However, for the state in the integrand, we can substitute the definition given by the 
lefthand side as follows: 
|ψ;tI = |ψ; 0I − i

The above expression does not look simple either and appears to make getting 
the solution even more complicated because the unknown |ψ;tI still exists on 
the righthand side, which now involves double integration with respect to time.10.1 Quantum Dynamics of Pure States 337
However, given that the magnitude of Hˆ1(t) is small enough so that its effect 
becomes smaller and smaller as the order of integration increases, one can continue 
applying the iteration procedure and obtain the following formal solution: 
|ψ;tI = |ψ; 0I − i

Equation (10.22) is a general formal solution for the state in the interaction 
picture and is well defined as long as the infinite order limit of the sum of 
multiple time integrations converges. Finding out the exact condition for such 
convergence to be ensured is not a simple task in general. However, in many cases, 
the convergence can be determined at least numerically given a specific form of 
the Hamiltonian. Here, we consider only physically well-defined perturbations for 
which the convergence of perturbation terms is guaranteed. 
If the effect of  t
0 dt
Hˆ1,I (t
)/h¯ is very small compared to the zeroth order term, 
an approximation that keeps only the first order term in Eq. (10.22) is reasonable. 
Thus, we obtain the following first order approximation:

Employing the definitions of Eqs. (10.17) and (10.19), and returning to the original 
Schrödinger picture, we find that the above expression is equivalent to

10.1.3 Fermi’s Golden Rule 
Suppose we are interested in the rate of transition of the system from an eigenstate 
of Hˆ0 to another one due to the perturbation Hˆ1(t). Thus, let us consider the case 
where the state of the system at t = 0 is an eigenstate of Hˆ0 with eigenvalue Ej ,338 10 Quantum Dynamics of Pure and Mixed States
which we denote as |Ej . Then, the first order approximation for the state at time t, 
Eq. (10.24), can be expressed as

Let us denote the probability for the system at time t to have made transition to 
another eigenstate |Ek of Hˆ0 as Pj→k(t). Without losing generality, we can assume 
that Ej |Ek = 0. Up to the lowest order of Hˆ1(t), this probability can be calculated 
by projecting the above first order time dependent perturbation approximation onto 
|Ek and taking its absolute square as follows:

Hamiltonian is given by 
Ek|Hˆ1(t)|Ej  = Jjke−iωt, (10.30)

where the Fourier integral definition of the delta function, Eq. (1.85), has been used. 
Equation (10.32) is the simplest form of the Fermi’s golden rule (FGR), and 
serves as the basis for calculating transition rates for many dynamical processes 
and for calculating intensities of spectroscopic transitions. Although this expression 
involves a delta function, which is singular, a physically meaningful answers can be 
obtained from this if the implication of taking the mathematical limit of t → ∞
is taken into consideration within the proper physical context. In addition, the final 
states to which the transition occurs are hardly a single discrete state in many real 
situations. This can also be used to remove the singularity. 
Let us consider the case where Hˆ1(t) represents the interaction of an electric 
field and a molecule with transition dipole Djk. In this case, within the dipole 
approximation1 and the rotating wave approximation,2 the perturbation Hamiltonian

Appendix of this chapter for more details.

to

h¯ δ(Ek − Ej − hω), ¯ (10.34) 
which gives the intensity of the transition at frequency ω. In this expression, δ(Ek −
Ej − hω) ¯ can be viewed as an idealization of a narrow peak centered at ω = (Ek −
Ej )/h¯. 
Let us consider another common case where the FGR rate expression, 
Eq. (10.32), leads to a more well-defined rate. Assume that the final states are 
not in fact a single state but a set of states and assume also that ω = 0 in Eq. (10.30) 
for simplicity. The FGR rate in this case becomes the sum of all rates given by 
Eq. (10.32) over all possible final states as follows: 
j→Sf
F GR = 
k∈Sf
2π|Jjk|
2
h¯ δ(Ek − Ej ). (10.35) 
Let us also assume that the final states form a continuum with distribution 
wf (Ef , ξf ) such that 

k∈Sf
=

dEk

dξf wf (Ek, ξf ), (10.36) 
where ξf collectively represents the set of additional quantum numbers needed 
to completely specify each of the final states in the set Sf . Employing the above 
relationship in Eq. (10.35) and then conducting the integration over Ek, we then 
obtain the following rate expression: 
j→Sf
F GR =

where we have included the general case where Jjk depends on ξf . In a simple case 
where Jjk is independent of ξf , which is now denoted as Jjf , the above expression10.2 Quantum Dynamics of Mixed Quantum States 341
can be simplified further to 
j→Sf
F GR = 2π|Jjf |

h¯ ρf (Ej ), (10.38) 
where ρf (Ej ) =  dξf wf (Ej , ξf ) is the final density of states at Ej . 
10.2 Quantum Dynamics of Mixed Quantum States 
So far, we have assumed that a complete information on the quantum state of the 
system is available. This is hardly the case in reality. In addition to the intrinsic 
quantum uncertainty, there always exist additional uncertainties at practical level 
due to imprecision, disorder, and lack of full information on conditions determining 
the states. Systems of these characteristics are in mixed quantum states and need to 
be treated at the level of a density operator. 
10.2.1 Density Operator and Quantum Liouville Equation 
The concept of the density operator is more general than quantum states we 
considered so far and requires both ket and bra for its definition. Any pure quantum 
state can be represented by a density operator. Consider a quantum state |ψ. Then, 
the density operator corresponding to this state is as follows: 
ρˆψ = |ψψ|. (10.39) 
If the system is governed by a Hamiltonian Hˆ , then the state prepared in |ψ at time 
t = 0 evolves to become |ψ;t = UˆH (t)|ψ at time t. For the definition of the 
density operator to be consistent at all time, given that it is defined as above at time 
t = 0, it should at time t become 
ρˆψ (t) = |ψ;tψ;t| = UˆH (t)|ψψ|Uˆ †
H (t). (10.40) 
Taking the time derivative of the above density operator, then we find that 
∂
∂t ρˆψ (t) = − i
h¯
Hˆ UˆH (t)|ψψ|Uˆ †
H (t) +

= − i
h¯
[H , ˆ ρˆψ (t)]. (10.41)342 10 Quantum Dynamics of Pure and Mixed States
The above equation is an example of the quantum Liouville equation, which can be 
shown to be valid for any density operator. 
Now, let us consider an example of a mixed quantum state. Assume that we know 
the system is either in state |ψ1 or |ψ2, but do not know exactly which state the 
system is in. The only information available is that their respective probabilities are 
p1 and p2. This kind of situation is completely different from the case where the 
state is given by a linear combination of |ψ1 and |ψ2 that is still a pure state, and 
can be represented by the following density operator: 
ρˆ = p1|ψ1ψ1| + p2|ψ2ψ2|, (10.42) 
where it is assumed that |ψ1 and |ψ2 are normalized. In the above expression, 
p1 + p2 = 1, while p1, p2 ≥ 0. Note that the two states |ψ1 and |ψ2 do not have 
to be orthogonal to each other. Since the possibilities for the system to be in either 
of these two states are completely uncorrelated, the above density operator should 
at time t become 
ρ(t) ˆ = p1|ψ1;tψ1;t| + p2|ψ2;tψ2;t|
= p1UˆH (t)|ψ1ψ1|Uˆ †
H (t) + p2UˆH (t)|ψ2ψ2|Uˆ †
H (t)
= UˆH (t)ρˆUˆ †
H (t). (10.43) 
The above expression suggests that the manner of time evolution for the density 
operator is independent of whether it represents the pure or mixed state as long as 
the governing Hamiltonian is the same. 
Extending the concept of the mixed state illustrated above to more general cases 
that involve more than two states, we can now define a general density operator, 
ρˆ = 
j
pj |ψj ψj |, (10.44) 
where each |ψj  is normalized and pj ≥ 0 represents the probability for the system 
to be in state |ψj . Thus, 
j pj = 1. It is obvious that the density operator 
defined in this way is always Hermitian. In addition, for any state |ϕ, ϕ| ˆρ|ϕ is 
always nonnegative. This means that the diagonal elements of any density operator 
in any basis, which are probabilities to find the system in those states, are always 
nonnegative. 
For the density operator given by Eq. (10.44) at time t = 0, the density operator 
at time t becomes 
ρ(t) ˆ = UˆH (t)ρˆUˆ †
H (t), (10.45)10.2 Quantum Dynamics of Mixed Quantum States 343

∂t ρ(t) ˆ = − i
h¯

H , ˆ ρ(t) ˆ

≡ −iLˆ ρ(t). ˆ (10.46) 
The second equality in the above equation serves as the definition of Lˆ , a super￾operator3 called quantum Liouvillian. 
Given the mixture of states |ψj , each with probability pj , the expectation value 
of any physical observable Aˆ should be 
Aˆ = 
j
pj ψj |Aˆ|ψj . (10.47) 
It turns out that the above quantity can be calculated in terms of the density operator 
ρˆ given by Eq. (10.44) as follows: 
Aˆ = T r 

The necessity to introduce a mixed state goes beyond any experimental imper￾fection, but has also more fundamental quantum mechanical origin. Mixed states 
can emerge for any system that cannot be completely decoupled from the rest of 
the universe even though there is no direct coupling of the system Hamiltonian 
and that of the rest [56]. For this, let us consider the direct product space of the 
system, for which |φn’s form a complete basis, and the rest of the universe, for 
which we assume the existence of a complete orthonormal basis denoted as |Xγ ’s. 
Since the entire universe is closed, any state defined in the direct product space can 
be expressed as the following linear combination: 
| = 
n

γ
Cnγ |φn⊗|Xγ . (10.58)

which can be shown to be always less than or equal to one. 
Thus, ρˆ given by Eq. (10.60) in general represents a mixed state created due to 
an entanglement of the system with other environmental degrees freedom, for which 
no explicit control or specification through measurement is possible. On the other 
hand, it is straightforward to show that the average value given by Eq. (10.59) is 
indeed equal to T r 
Aˆρˆ

. In other words, the definition of average, Eq. (10.48), is 
general and can be used even when the average value cannot be expressed as an 
expectation value with respect to pure system states. 
An important class of density operators is called the canonical equilibrium 
density operator, which is defined as follows: 
ρˆβ = e−βHˆ
Zβ
, (10.63) 
where Hˆ is the Hamiltonian of the system, β = 1/(kBT ), with kB being the 
Boltzmann constant, and Zβ is the partition function of the canonical ensemble 
defined as 
Zβ = T r{e−βHˆ
} = 
j
e−βEj . (10.64) 
In the above expression, Ej ’s are eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian Hˆ . By definition, 
T r{ ˆρβ} = 1. In addition, it is stationary with respect to time since it commutes with 
the time evolution operator. For any physical observable, Aˆ, the equilibrium average 
over the canonical ensemble is given by 
Aˆβ = T r 

10.2.2 Time Dependent Perturbation Theory for Mixed 
Quantum States 
Let us consider again the case where the total Hamiltonian H (t) ˆ is given by the sum 
of the zeroth order and time dependent first order terms such as Eq. (10.13), and 
denote the time evolution operator for this time dependent Hamiltonian as UˆH (t). 
Given the density operator ρ(ˆ 0) at time t = 0, the density operator at time t becomes 
ρ(t) ˆ = UˆH (t)ρ(ˆ 0)Uˆ †
H (t). (10.66) 
On the other hand, the time dependent state at time t in the interaction picture with 
respect to Hˆ0 is 
|ψ;tI = Uˆ †
0 (t)|ψ;t = Uˆ †
0 (t)UˆH (t)|ψ; 0. (10.67) 
Let us combine this with Eq. (10.22) and note the fact that the initial state, |ψ; 0 =
|ψ; 0I , is general. Therefore, we obtain the following identity: 
UˆH (t) = Uˆ0(t) exp(+)

The subscript (+) in the above expression implies positive or chronological time

Employing the definition of Hˆ1,I (t) given by Eq. (10.19) in Eq. (10.68), we 
obtain the following expression for the time evolution operator:

at time t = 0 to the rightmost place within the trace. 
10.2.3 FGR for Mixed States 
As an application of Eq. (10.72), let us consider a simple but widely used model. 
Assume that there is a two-state system spanned completely by |1 and |2, which 
form an orthonormal basis for the system. This system is coupled to all other degrees 
of freedom denoted as “bath.” At the zeroth order level, this bath is independently 
coupled to each system state and does not couple them. Thus, the zeroth order 
Hamiltonian for the system plus bath is assumed to be 
Hˆ0 = (E1 + Bˆ1)|11| + (E2 + Bˆ2)|22| + Hˆb, (10.73) 
where Bˆ1 and Bˆ2 are bath operators representing the coupling of each state, |1 or 
|2, to the bath and Hˆb is the Hamiltonian for the bath only. 
Examples of the two system states are spin states of any spin 1/2 particle or two 
electronic states of interest in any molecular system. The total quantum state space 
is a direct product of the two system state space and that of the bath. Thus, the trace 
operation of an operator Oˆ that depends on both system and bath can be expressed 
as

Let us assume that a small time dependent perturbation coupling the two system 
states is turned on at time t = 0. Thus, for t ≥ 0, 
Hˆ1(t) = Jˆ
12(t)|12| + Jˆ†
12(t)|21|, (10.75)10.2 Quantum Dynamics of Mixed Quantum States 351
where J (t) ˆ is time dependent (in general) and can also depend on the bath degrees 
of freedom. Thus, J (t) ˆ is assumed to be an operator in the bath space. 
For t ≥ 0, the total Hamiltonian becomes H (t) ˆ = Hˆ0+Hˆ1(t). Let us assume that 
the total system plus the bath, before the perturbation Hamiltonian Hˆ1(t) is turned 
on, is represented by the following density operator. 
ρ(ˆ 0) = |11| ˆρb, (10.76) 
where ρˆb is a bath density operator that can be a canonical equilibrium density 
operator or any other nonequilibrium density operator. Thus, the above density 
operator represents the system prepared in the pure state |1 and the bath in some 
kind of mixed states as prescribed by ρˆb. 
Suppose that the major quantity of interest is the population of the state |2 of 
system at time t. This can be calculated, up to the second order of perturbation, 
by using Aˆ = |22| in Eq. (10.72). Although there are many terms in Eq. (10.72), 
for the model and process considered here, most of the terms disappear because 
2|e±iHˆ0t/h¯ |1=1|e±iHˆ0t/h¯ |2 = 0. Thus, Eq. (10.72) simplifies to

Since Hˆ0 given by Eq. (10.73) is diagonal with respect to the two state system

emission of photon with frequency −ω. Equation (10.86) can be used for the 
modeling of absorption and emission lineshapes of various electronic transitions 
and is reliable as long as the two states involved in the transition are well separated 
from others and assumptions of the model Hamiltonian are well justified.354 10 Quantum Dynamics of Pure and Mixed States

Various rate processes involving transitions of quantum states such as the transfer 
of electron, excitation energy, or proton can be described in terms of the above 
FGR rate expression. Indeed, well known Marcus rate [33, 34] expression for the 
electron transfer rate or the Förster rate [35] expression for excitation energy transfer 
can be derived [36, 37] from this FGR expression with further approximations and 
consideration of relevant physical conditions. 
10.3 Summary and Questions 
In the Schrödinger picture, the dynamics of a quantum system can be viewed as 
that due to the time evolution of states. On the other hand, physical observables are 
represented by time dependent operators unless explicit time dependence is needed 
due to external factors. In the Heisenberg picture, the view is opposite and the time 
dependence is carried through that of time dependent Heisenberg operators defined 
by Eq. (10.5). Interaction picture is in-between the two pictures and assumes that 
the operators evolve according to a zeroth or reference Hamiltonian while the states 
evolve according to the remaining part that represents the key interaction term of 
the Hamiltonian that is the major focus of the dynamics study. All of these pictures 
are equivalent because of the unitarity of a time evolution operator. 
Time dependent perturbation theory allows calculation of the effects of a 
perturbation Hamiltonian on the time evolution of states and physical observables 
and can be best expressed in the interaction picture where the state evolves in time 
only due to the perturbation Hamiltonian term. Considering only the first order 
term, one obtains a simple and general expression for the state in the interaction 
picture, Eq. (10.23), and that in the Schrödinger picture, Eq. (10.24). Use of this 
expression for the calculation of the transition probability between two states and 
calculation of the transition rate as its time derivative in the stead state limit leads to 
the FGR rate expression. This leads to the well-known expression for the intensity 
of spectroscopic transition, Eq. (10.34). For the case of transitions to a collection 
of final states with energy density ρf (E), averaging of the FGR rate expression, 
Eq. (10.35), leads to the final rate expression, Eq. (10.38). 
A broad class of physical systems requires introduction of mixed states that 
cannot be represented by a single ket (bra). This is because the system under study 
is a collection or ensemble of states due to experimental limitations in creating 
pure quantum states. More fundamentally, this can be due to the entanglement of 
the system under study with other environmental degrees of freedom. This requires 
introduction of a density operator, which can be expressed in general as Eq. (10.44),Appendix: Interaction Hamiltonian in the Presence of Radiation 355
for which time evolution in both ket and bra space becomes necessary. The resulting 
time evolution equation, Eq. (10.46), is known as quantum Liouville equation. The 
average of any physical observable for the density operator is given by Eq. (10.48), 
and any density operator is Hermitian and satisfies Eqs. (10.54) and (10.55). 
Time dependent perturbation theory can be extended to the time evolution of 
the density operator by employing perturbation expansions for both time dependent 
kets and bras constituting the density operator. The resulting lowest order terms 
representing transitions between states now become second order with respect to 
the perturbation. Calculation of the time derivative of the probability for the system 
to be in a certain final state of interest and consideration of its steady state limit, 
results in a general expression for the FGR rate, Eq. (10.85). This expression is valid 
for a general mixed state given by Eq. (10.76) as the initial condition. The lineshape 
expression, Eq. (10.86), and a well-known FGR rate expression, Eq. (10.87), can 
then be obtained with additional assumptions and approximations.

Appendix: Interaction Hamiltonian in the Presence 
of Radiation 
This section provides a brief overview of the classical theory of electromagnetic 
fields [38] and then outlines how the interaction between molecules and the 
classical radiation field can be treated. Thus, the approach being described here 
is semiclassical because only molecules are considered quantum mechanically356 10 Quantum Dynamics of Pure and Mixed States
while the electromagnetic field is simply viewed as time dependent classical 
external potential. This approach is valid and practical for the description of simple 
spectroscopic experiments. 
Classically, the Hamiltonian for a particle with mass m and charge q and its 
interaction with electric and magnetic fields, E(r,t) and B(r,t), in Gaussian units, 
can be expressed as [37, 38] 
H = 1
2m
	
p − q
c
A(r,t)
2
+ q(r,t) + V (r), (10.88) 
where V (r) is the potential applied to the particle in the absence of the electromag￾netic radiation and A(r,t) and (r,t) are vector and scalar potentials that are related 
to the electric and magnetic fields, E(r,t) and B(r,t), as follows: 
E(r,t) +
1
c
∂A(r,t)
∂t = −∇(r, t). (10.89) 
B(r,t) = ∇ × A(r, t). (10.90) 
It is straightforward to show through vector calculus that Eq. (10.88) results in the 
following equation of motion [37, 38]:

dt2 = q

dr
dt × {∇ × A(r,t)}

Inserting Eqs. (10.89) and (10.90) into the above equation, one can show that it is 
equivalent to the following equation of motion that is more well-known:

The definitions of electric and magnetic fields, Eqs. (10.89) and (10.90), leave 
great degree of flexibility in choosing the vector and scalar potentials because, for an 
arbitrary function f (r,t), the following replacement does not cause any difference 
in the electric and magnetic fields.

Equations (10.93) and (10.94) are called gauge transformation, and provide ways to 
choose appropriate vector and scalar potentials that are easy to work with while not 
changing the electric and magnetic fields. One important gauge is called Coulomb 
gauge, which is characterized by the following condition: 
∇ · A(r,t) = 0. (10.97) 
The gauge transformation, Eqs. (10.93) and (10.94), makes it always possible to 
find a vector potential satisfying the above property. Let us assume that we happen 
to know a pair of A and  corresponding to given electric and magnetic fields, 
but that ∇ · A = 0. Then, we can choose a function f in Eq. (10.93) such that 
∇ · A = ∇2f . The resulting A satisfies the Coulomb gauge condition, Eq. (10.97). 
In a continuous medium satisfying linear constitutive relations with dielectric 
constant  and magnetic permeability μ, Maxwell’s equations can be shown to be 
equivalent to the following partial differential equations for the vector and scalar 
potentials:

where ρ(r,t) and J(r,t) are charge and current densities. In Coulomb gauge where 
Eq. (10.97) is satisfied, the above equations are simplified further to 
−∇2(r,t) = 4πρ(r,t)

∇(r,t) = 4πμ
c J(r, t). (10.101) 
Let us now consider the simplest case where there are no sources of charge and 
current. Then, ρ(r,t) = 0 and J(r,t) = 0, and Eq. (10.100) reduces to 
∇2(r,t) = 0. (10.102)358 10 Quantum Dynamics of Pure and Mixed States
A solution of this, which satisfies the boundary condition of the infinite space, is 
that  = 0. That is, in free space, the scalar potential can be assumed to be zero (in 
the Coulomb gauge). With this assumption, Eq. (10.101) now simplifies to 
∇2A(r,t) − μ
c2
∂2A(r,t)
∂t2 = 0. (10.103) 
Many solutions are possible for this partial differential equation. One of the simplest 
solutions is the following plane wave solution: 
A(r,t) = A0ue cos(k · r − ωt), (10.104) 
where 
k2 = |k|
2 = μ
c2 ω2, (10.105) 
Assuming that both  and μ are real and positive (non-absorptive medium), the 
refractive index is defined as 
n = √μ. (10.106) 
Thus, in a medium with refractive index n, the plane wave solution travels with a 
speed v = ω/k = c/n. 
Inserting Eq. (10.104) into the condition Eq. (10.97), one can find that 
k · ue = 0. (10.107) 
That is, ue is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the vector potential. 
Inserting Eq. (10.104) into Eq. (10.90), 
B(r,t) = A0(k × ue)sin(ωt − k · r) = A0kub sin(ωt − k · r), (10.108) 
where ub = k×ue/k, the direction of the magnetic field. Inserting Eq. (10.104) into 
Eq. (10.96) with  = 0, 
E = A0ω
c ue sin(ωt − k · r) = A0k
n ue sin(ωt − k · r). (10.109) 
For the case of a a quantum mechanical particle with mass m and charge q in the 
presence of an electromagnetic field, which is still treated as a classical wave, the 
Hamiltonian operator is obtained by simply replacing the physical observables in 
Eq. (10.88) with quantum operators as follows: 
Hˆ = 1

c
pˆ · A(rˆ,t) − q
c
A(rˆ,t) · pˆ + q2

Employing the following identity: 
pˆ · A(rˆ,t) = A(rˆ,t) · pˆ +
h¯
i
∇ · A(rˆ, t), (10.112) 
the Hamiltonian of Eq. (10.110) can be expressed as 
Hˆ = pˆ 2

mc A(rˆ,t) · pˆ − hq¯
ic
∇ · A(rˆ,t) + q2
2mc2 A(rˆ,t)2 .
(10.113) 
In Coulomb gauge, ∇ · A(rˆ,t) = 0. In addition, assuming weak enough field, 
the quadratic term A(rˆ,t)2 can be neglected. As a result, Eq. (10.110) can be 
approximated as 
H (t) ˆ = Hˆ0 + q(rˆ,t) − q
mc A(rˆ,t) · pˆ, (10.114) 
where Hˆ0 is the Hamiltonian in the absence of the electromagnetic radiation and is 
given by 
Hˆ0 = pˆ 2
2m + V (rˆ) . (10.115) 
Let us consider the case where the particle is subject to a monochromatic 
radiation of frequency ω. Then, using the fact (rˆ,t) = 0 and inserting Eq. (10.104) 
into Eq. (10.114), we find the following time dependent Hamiltonian: 
H (t) ˆ = Hˆ0 + Hˆ1(t), (10.116) 
where 
Hˆ1(t) = − q
2mc A0
	
eik·rˆ−iωt + e−ik·rˆ+iωt

ue · pˆ. (10.117) 
In a typical molecular spectroscopy, the wavelength of the radiation is much larger 
than the molecular length scale. Therefore, one can make an approximation that 
k · rˆ ≈ 0, which is referred to as dipole approximation for a reason to be clear below. 
Then, the matter radiation interaction can be approximated as360 10 Quantum Dynamics of Pure and Mixed States
Hˆ1(t) ≈ − q
2mc A0

pˆ = im

 H0, ue · Dˆ

where Dˆ = qrˆ, the dipole operator. That is, the radiation interacts with the dipole 
operator and this is the reason why the approximation of k · rˆ ≈ 0 is called dipole 
approximation. 
Let us consider the matrix element of Hˆ1(t) between two orthonormal eigenstates 
of Hˆ0 with eigenvalues Ej and Ek as follows:

where Djk is the transition dipole vector between states |Ej  and |Ek. The above 
expression has two time dependent terms, one of which becomes almost non￾oscillatory when resonant with the energy difference between the final and initial 
states. On the other hand, the other becomes highly oscillatory. Ignoring this 
highly oscillatory term and keeping only the resonant term is called rotating wave 
approximation. 
All the expressions derived above can easily be extended to molecular or many 
particle systems, and the resulting expressions similar to Eq. (10.121), along with 
the rotating wave approximation, leads to the interaction Hamiltonian such as 
Eq. (10.33). 
The description of molecule-radiation interaction presented here is limited to lin￾ear interactions and semiclassical in nature since the electromagnetic wave is treated 
classically. There are well-established theories of higher order molecule-radiation 
interactions [39, 40] or fully quantum mechanical treatment of radiation [20, 41], 
which can provide more modern perspective of molecule-radiation interactions.Exercise Problems with Solutions 361

Calculation of Polyatomic Molecules 
It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in 
science are not found because they are useful; they are found 
because it was possible to find them. 
– J. Robert Oppenheimer 
Abstract This chapter presents more detailed theoretical account of methods used 
for the calculation of electronic states of polyatomic molecules. The main focus 
is the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation and its implementation employing finite 
basis as formulated by Roothaan. Brief accounts of more advanced methods that 
go beyond the HF approximation are provided. The basic principles underlying the 
Density Functional Theory (DFT) for the calculation of the ground electronic state 
of adiabatic electronic states are also explained. 
In this chapter, we will go through in more detail how to find approximate solutions 
for the electronic Schrödinger equation, Eq. ( 99), or its equivalent. For this, let us 
rewrite the electronic HamiltonianHˆel given by Eq. (9.8) as follows:

11.1 Hartree-Fock Approximation and Roothaan Equation 
A simple but limited derivation of the HF energy, for the case of atomic orbitals, 
was provided in Chap.8. This chapter provides a more detailed derivation for more 
general cases [14, 42]. 
11.1.1 General Single Determinant State 
Let us assume that the electronic state for the Ne electrons can be expressed as a 
single Slater determinant as follows: 
|Ne  =
1
√Ne!

, (11.4) 
where |ψk(μ) is the kth single electron spin-orbit state for electron μ = 1, ··· , Ne, 
and Pˆ represents all distinct permutations of the Ne electrons, with NP being the 
number of pairwise permutations equivalent to each permutation. It is assumed that 
all |ψk(μ)’s are orthogonal. If not, it should be possible to find a transformation 
that makes them orthogonal since the starting spin-orbit states should be linearly 
independent [42]. Such a transformation only results in the difference in the 
prefactor of the Slater determinant. On the other hand, since the starting basis 
states for molecular electronic states are nonorthogonal in general, it is important 
to specify the condition for orthogonality in more detail as will become clear later. 
First, let us calculate the expectation value of Hˆel with respect to |Ne  as

Major steps leading to the final expression above are summarized below. 
• The first equality results from the fact that there are Ne different ways to assign 
single electron state for the electron with index μ by the permutationPˆ. 
• The single electron interaction term survives only when each realization of the 
permutation Pˆ is exactly the same as that of Pˆ. Otherwise, there are at least one 
spin-orbital states that are orthogonal for those electrons with indices different 
from μ. 
• The (Ne − 1)! factor results from counting all possible ways of permuting the 
(Ne − 1) electrons except for theμ electron. 
• The second equality above results from the fact that the single electron term is 
independent ofμ and can be replaced with 1. 
• After this replacement, the summation over μ results in a factor of Ne, which is 
divided by the same factor in the remaining denominator.

. (11.8) 
The final expression above is obtained through a procedure described below. 
• In the first equality of the above identities, the summation over j and k represent 
all distinct single electron spin-orbital states assigned to μ and ν electrons out of 
the permutation Pˆ. There are (Ne − 2)! ways of permuting electrons other than 
these two. These, when divided with the denominator, result in (Ne − 2)!/Ne! =
1/Ne(Ne − 1). 
• Out of all realizations of the permutation Pˆ
, only those that are exactly the same 
as those fromPˆ and those for which the spin-orbital states for μ and ν electrons 
are interchanged survive because, for other permutations, there are at least one 
electron (other than μ and ν) that involves overlap of two orthogonal spin-orbit 
states. 
• The permutation of Pˆ
, which differs from Pˆ only by the exchange of two 
spin-orbit states involves one additional exchange compared to Pˆ. Therefore, 
(−1)NP +NP = −1 for this case, which explains the negative sign of the second 
term. 
• The second equality results from the fact that the indices μ and ν, being dummy 
indices, can be replaced with 1 and 2 without affecting the final outcome. The 
summation over μ and ν thus results in Ne(Ne − 1) factor, which is divided by 
exactly the same factor in the remaining denominator. 
• In the second equality, the case with j = k was added since the two-electron 
terms in this case cancel out and do not contribute to the summation. 
For more compact expression of the two-electron interaction terms, let us use 
simpler notations that are consistent with conventional definitions used in electronic 
structure theory as described below. 
Notations for Two Electron Terms 
Since the two electron interaction terms commonly involve the same Coulomb 
operator and electron indices 1 and 2 are dummy variables, we can express all 
the two-electron interaction terms as follows: 
(continued)11.1 Hartree-Fock Approximation and Roothaan Equation 367
ψjψk|ψj ψk=ψj (1)|ψk(2)|
1
rˆ12
|ψj (1)|ψk(2)
= (ψjψj |ψkψk). (11.9) 
Note thatψjψk|ψj ψk=ψkψj |ψkψj  since the exchange of 1 and 2 for 
both ket and bra does not cause any difference. The second equality above 
introduces so called chemist’s notation, and is intuitively useful because bra 
and kets for the same electron are placed together. Note that (ψjψj |ψkψk) =
(ψkψk|ψjψj ) for this case. 
Let us also define the following difference term: 
ψjψk||ψj ψk=ψjψk|ψj ψk−ψjψk|ψkψj 
= ψjψk|ψj ψk−ψkψj |ψj ψk
= ψkψj |ψkψj −ψkψj |ψj ψk
= ψkψj |ψkψj −ψjψk|ψkψj . (11.10) 
Combining Eqs. (11.7) and (11.8) and employing the two-electron integrals 
introduced above, we find that Eq. ( 11.5) can be expressed as

The above expression has been derived under the assumption that all the single

ensured. 
ψj |ψk = δjk. (11.12) 
Thus, employing the Lagrange multiplier method [ 19, 43] to incorporate the above 
constraint, we can find out the best approximation for the energy with this constraint 
employing a LagrangianL defined as follows:

Comparing this with Eq. (11.23), we find thatλ∗
jk = λkj . Thus,λjk’s are components 
of a Hermitian matrix, which has real eigenvalues. Thus, solving Eq. ( 11.22) is 
sufficient for finding the solution of the HF approximation. 
Equation (11.22) is similar to an eigenvalue problem, but is not yet in a 
conventional form because λjk’s form a non-diagonal matrix. However, since this 
matrix is Hermitian, it is possible to find a unitary transformation such that it 
becomes diagonal. For this, let us introduce the following Fock operator : 
Fˆ 1[ψ] = hˆ1 +
Ne
k=1

Jˆ 1[ψk] − Kˆ 1[ψk]

. (11.25) 
Thus, Eq. (11.22) can be expressed as 
Fˆ 1[ψ]|ψj (1) = 
Ne
k=1
λjk|ψk(1), for j = 1, ··· , Ne (11.26) 
Since the matrix consisting of theλjk as its elements, which we denote here as , is 
Hermitian, there always exist normalized eigenvectors u1, ··· , uNe with eigenvalues 
E1, ··· , ENe such that 
uk = Ekuk, for k = 1, ··· , Ne (11.27) 
Let us define a transformation matrix U = (u1, ··· , uNe ), for which Ujk = (uk)j . 
Then, U†U = I , where I is the identity matrix with dimension Ne, and transforms 
 to diagonal form as follows: 
U†U = U†UE = E, (11.28) 
where E is the diagonal matrix with theEk as its diagonal elements. It is also possible 
to prove thatUU† = I . Thus,U is a unitary matrix. 
Now, let us consider the following vector notation for Eq.( 11.26).

Note that we have used the fact that Fˆ 1[ψ] and U† commute with each other, since 
the former is a quantum mechanical operator whereas the latter is a matrix being 
applied to the vector of states. The identity of Eq. ( 11.28) has also been used. 
Let us now define,

In the above expression, note that Fˆ 1 is defined in terms of untransformed states. 
However, it turns out that it is equivalent to one expressed in terms of transformed 
states. This can be shown using the definition of Fˆ 1 directly. Sincehˆ1 is independent

where the fact that|ψk(1) =

j (1) and the unitarity ofU have been used. 
Therefore, Fˆ 1[ψ] in Eq. (11.26) can be replaced withFˆ 1[ψ
]. 
Note that the transformation from |ψj (1) to |ψ
j (1) by the unitary transforma￾tion changes the Slater determinant state, Eq. ( 11.4), only by a complex factor of unit 
magnitude since the determinant of U is a complex number with unit magnitude. 
Therefore, the transformation does not affect the actual many electron states either 
[14, 42]. Therefore, without losing generality, we can replace |ψ
j (1) in Eq. (11.26) 
with |ψj (1). The resulting equation is known as the canonical form of the HF 
equation and is summarized below. 
Canonical Form of the HF Equation 
The slater determinant state for many electrons, Eq. ( 114), which minimizes the 
total electronic energy, consists of the |ψj  that satisfy the following canonical 
HF equation: 
Fˆ 1[ψ]|ψj (1) = (hˆ1 +

k=1
(Jˆ 1[ψk] − Kˆ 1[ψk])|ψj (1) = Ej |ψj (1),
(11.34) 
where j = 1, ··· , Ne. Note that all the states are orthogonal and satisfy the 
condition of Eq. (11.12). 
Taking inner product of Eq. ( 11.34) with ψj (1)|, we obtain the following 
expression for the energy of the state Ej : 
Ej = ψj (1)|Fˆ 1[ψ]|ψj (1)

1. Assume a set of trial |ψj . 
2. Calculate Fˆ 1[ψ] for the trial|ψj . 
3. Determine the new|ψj  and Ej satisfying Eq. (11.34). 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the HF energy, Eq. ( 11.36), has converged sufficiently. 
11.1.2 Restricted HF Equation for Doubly Filled Orbital States 
Let us now consider the simplest case where there are Ne = 2Nr electrons doubly 
occupying Nr orbitals. Thus, for p = 1, ··· , Nr, the spin-orbit states are expressed 
as 
|ψ2p−1(1)=|φp(1)|α(1), (11.37) 
|ψ2p(1)=|φp(1)|β(1), (11.38) 
where |φp(1) represents the spatial-orbital state |α(1) for electron labeled 1. On 
the other hand, |α(1) and |β(1) represent spin up and down states, respectively, 
also for electron 1. Then, the two electron interaction operators can be expressed 
in terms of orbital states. First, the Coulomb interaction terms can be expressed as

Kˆ 1[ψ2q−1]|φp(1)|β(1) = 0. (11.46)

Taking inner products of the above expressions with either α(1)| or β(1)| results 
in the same expression for two electron operations involving spatial orbitals. Thus, 
combining this with the remaining one electron term, one can obtain the canonical 
HF equation for spatial orbitals as summarized below.11.1 Hartree-Fock Approximation and Roothaan Equation 375

States 
Employing Eq. (11.47) (or Eq. (11.48)) in Eq. (11.34) and taking inner-product

Taking inner product of Eq. ( 11.49) with φp(1)|, we obtain the following

1. Assume a set of trial |φp. 
2. Calculate Fˆ[φ] for the trial|φp.376 11 Theories for Electronic Structure Calculation of Polyatomic Molecules
3. Determine new the|φp and Ep satisfying the restricted HF equation, Eq. ( 11.49). 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the HF energy, Eq. ( 11.52), has converged sufficiently. 
11.1.3 Linear Combination of Basis States 
The self-consistent procedure described in previous subsections for determining 
spin orbital or orbital states is simple in principle, but actual implementation in its 
most general form is a numerically challenging task. In order to address this issue, 
Roothaan [42] employed an approximation for the states as linear combinations of 
pre-defined basis states. The resulting equation, often called HF-Roothaan equation, 
amounts to solving matrix equation, and is more amenable for computation. Here, 
this approach is described for the case of doubly filled orbital states. 
Let us assume that each orbital state can be approximated as a linear combination 
of Ns basis states|ϕj (1), which are not necessarily orthogonal but are independent 
of each other. Then, we can in general create Ns orbital states out of them as follows: 
|φp(1) = 
Ns
k=1
Ckp|ϕk(1), p = 1, ··· , Ns. (11.53) 
However, note that onlyNr lowest energy orbital states will be used for calculating 
the Fock operator. Employing the above expression in Eq. ( 11.49), we obtain 
Fˆ
1[φ]|φp(1) = 
Ns
k=1
CkpFˆ
1[φ]|ϕk(1) = Ep

Ns
k=1
Ckp|ϕk(1), (11.54) 
where Ep is now one ofNs possible orbital energies. This is due to the use of a finite 
basis and is in contrast to the fact that the number of orbital energies for the original 
HF equation can be infinite. 
Taking inner product of Eq. ( 11.54) withϕj (1)|, we obtain 
ϕj (1)|Fˆ

Let us define 
Fjk = ϕj (1)|Fˆ
1[φ]|ϕk(1), (11.56) 
Sjk = ϕj (1)|ϕk(1). (11.57)11.1 Hartree-Fock Approximation and Roothaan Equation 377
Then, Eq. (11.55) can be expressed as follows: 

Ns

FjkCkp − SjkCkpEp

where j,p = 1, ··· , Ns. The above equation is called HF-Roothaan equation and 
has to be solved self consistently because the Fjk’s depend on theCkp’s. The above 
equation can be written compactly in terms of a matrix equation as follows: 
FC − SCE = 0, (11.59) 
where E is aNs × Ns diagonal matrix with its elementsEp’s. 
The matrix elements of the Fock operator, defined by Eq. ( 11.56), can be

the fact that ϕjϕj |ϕkϕk = (ϕjϕk|ϕj ϕk) and ϕjϕj |ϕkϕk = (ϕjϕk|ϕj ϕk). Then,

. (11.65) 
Thus, Eq. (11.59), along with Eq. (11.65), and Eq. (11.52), expressed in terms of 
the same basis orbital states, can be solved together in the following self-consistent 
manner: 
1. Assume a set of trial Ckp. 
2. Calculate Fˆ
1 for the trialCkp. 
3. Determine the newCkp and Ep satisfying the restricted HF equation, Eq. ( 11.59). 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the HF energy, Eq. ( 11.52), has converged sufficiently. 
Note that, among the Ns orbitals obtained, only the Nr lowest orbitals need to 
be occupied for the calculation of the ground electronic state within the HF 
approximation. Other Ns − Nr orbitals are called virtual orbitals. The secular 
equations are then solved and iteration continues until satisfactory convergence is 
achieved. 
11.1.4 Choice of Basis Functions 
The choice of the best possible basis set is a key issue in actual numerical 
implementation of the HF method. This is because the computational cost of the HF 
method calculation increases as the fourth power of the number of basis functions 
in general. Thus, unless judicious choice of basis functions is made, numerical 
implementation of the HF method can become unwieldy quite easily. Decades of 
theoretical and computational research have been made for identifying efficient and 
accurate enough basis functions and for numerical verification of their accuracies 
[2, 14, 15, 44–46]. A comprehensive presentation of this topic goes beyond the scope 
of this book. Thus, only a few key points concerning the choice of basis functions 
are summarized below. 
• Although using a set of orthogonal basis functions is mathematically convenient 
and is possible to some extent, using atom-centered orbital functions that are 
non-orthogonal in general turned out to be much more convenient and reliable
1 The matrix of Pjk ’s is known as the charge density matrix and plays an essential role in 
determining various chemical properties such as bond order, partial charges, and dipole moments, 
etc. 11.1 Hartree-Fock Approximation and Roothaan Equation 379
choice. For this, the approach of using the LCAO-MO approximation serves as 
an important starting point except that the primitive basis functions used for the 
linear combination are not necessarily the actual atomic orbital functions but 
rather are viewed as closely related to them. 
• For qualitatively correct description of short and long range Coulomb inter￾actions, using Slater-type basis functions , rn−1Ylm(θ , φ)e−ζ r, which decay 
exponentially with r, is the best choice in reproducing qualitatively correct 
behavior for large r. However, numerical evaluation of Coulomb interactions 
using Slater-type orbitals is costly due to slow convergence. 
• Using Gaussian type basis functions , xpyq zr e−αr2
, is much more efficient for the 
evaluation of Coulomb interactions in particular because the actual integrations 
can be done by utilizing analytic expressions in most cases. However, using a 
single Gaussian type function as a basis is not a good choice because it does 
not reproduce appropriate limiting behavior. As a solution for this, the idea of 
contraction was developed. 
• A contracted Gaussian basis function is a linear combination of Gaussian-type 
functions with different exponents so as to best mimic a Slater type orbital. It 
turned out that combination of a few primitive Gaussian functions serves as a 
reasonable representation for a Slater-type orbital as far as the calculation of 
important physical quantities including the energy is concerned. The coefficients 
for forming a contracted Gaussian function are predetermined so as to best 
approximate a Slater-type orbital and remain fixed during a HF calculation. 
• A typical and most widely used HF method is to approximate the MO as a linear 
combination of primitive and contracted Gaussian functions and to determine the 
coefficients of the linear combination for the determination of minimum energy. 
• Application of the HF method is not limited to only calculation of the electronic 
state and its energy but is in fact used for identifying the structure of the 
molecules in the ground electronic state. This is because it is possible to include 
the variation of the molecular structure in the HF calculation so that the lowest 
possible energy can be obtained varying the structure of a molecule. This is 
typically known as geometry optimization. 
• Although not necessary for the geometry optimization calculation of the ground 
state, second derivatives of the potential energy surface, which form the Hessian 
matrix (see Eq. (4.89)), around the determined structure serve as important 
verification of the validity of the calculation result. This is because existence 
of negative eigenvalues for the Hessian matrix indicates that the determined 
structure does not even correspond to a local minimum energy, let alone the 
global energy minimum2 . Eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix for the optimized 
structure also provide key information on vibrational states of the molecule.
2 We describe here only the ground state, but geometry optimization is also used for determining 
transition states, for which the Hessian matrix has negative eigenvalues, and for excited states as 
well. 380 11 Theories for Electronic Structure Calculation of Polyatomic Molecules
11.1.5 Methods Beyond HF Approximation 
Configuration interaction (CI) [2, 14, 15, 47] goes beyond the HF approximation 
by adding new excited state Slater determinants (configurations) where some of the 
virtual orbitals in the HF determinant have replaced lower occupied orbitals. The 
simplest of this is called CI singles (CIS), where only single occupation of only 
one virtual orbitals is considered. CI singles and doubles (CISD) on the other hand 
include all the slater determinants where one or two virtual orbitals are occupied. 
It is known that the CI method can account for electronic correlation effects that 
are missing in HF reasonably well when their contributions are relatively small. 
However, for strongly correlated systems, convergence becomes slower and the 
calculation becomes unmanageable. Another fundamental issue of the CI methods 
is that it is not size consistent unless full contributions of CI are included. There are 
alternative approaches that are generally called many-body perturbation theories, 
the description of which requires more advanced formulations [ 2, 14, 15, 48]. 
It is also possible to use more than one determinants as the starting point for HF￾like calculations, which is in general called multi-configuration (MC) SCF method. 
Any method that uses MC-SCF solution as the starting reference state, instead of a 
single determinant HF state, is called multi-reference method [ 15]. 
The CI methods and multi-reference methods based on MC-SCF can also be 
used for the calculation of excited electronic states. In addition, it is also possible 
to conduct further SCF procedure for the excited states as well. A well-known 
method is called complete active space SCF (CAS-SCF) [ 15], which focuses on 
active regions of orbitals. CAS perturbation theory (CAS-PT) conducts additional 
perturbation correction for CAS-SCF and can improve the accuracy significantly as 
well. 
Among various electronic structure calculation methods that build on the HF 
approximation, the best but the most demanding method is called coupled cluster 
(CC) method [15, 48], which accounts for important many-electron interactions up 
to the infinite order based on theorems of diagrammatic expansion. The CC method 
can be based on either single or multi-reference. The CC method is often referred 
to as the gold standard and its full implementation employing multi-references is 
typically used for benchmarking other lower level approximations. 
11.2 Density Functional Theory 
Let us define|r;μ as the state where the position of electron μ is atr. Then, 
#
dr|r;μr;μ| = 1ˆμ, (11.66)11.2 Density Functional Theory 381
where 1ˆμ is the identity operator in the Hilbert space of the spatial orbital states 
for electron μ. Here, we assume a little more general case where there can be

It is straightforward to find position representations of the terms constituting the 
electronic Hamiltonian, Eq. (11.1), with the electron-nuclei potential replaced with 
the above single electron potential. First, the single electron term can be expressed

In above expressions, ρ1(r) is the density to find an electron (one-electron density) 
at positionr and ρ2(r, r

electron at r

It is clear thatρ1(r) = γ1(r; r) and ρ2(r, r

that γ1(r; r

to a single electron position space and that γ2(r, r

which appears to be much simpler than the original expression. The above expres￾sion shows that the information on γ1(r; r
), ρ1(r), ρ2(r, r
) and V (r) completely11.2 Density Functional Theory 383
determines the energy. Since all the three densities are completely determined from 
|e’s, which are in turn fully determined once V (r) is known because all other 
terms are intrinsic properties of the many electron system, all possible values of Eel
and corresponding states can be considered as different functionals of V (r). 
For the ground electronic state|e,g or its energyEel,g, which can be viewed as 
a unique functional of V (r), stronger statement is in fact possible. It turns out that 
the ground electronic state or energy can be viewed as a unique functional of ρ1(r). 
An elegant proof for this was first demonstrated by Hohenberg and Kohn [ 49]. 
Theorem 11.1 For any system with fixed number of electrons, the potential energy 
V (r) is a unique functional of the one-particle electron density, ρ1,g(r), for the ground 
electronic state |e,g. 
Proof If V (r) is not a unique functional of ρ1,g(r), the former cannot be determined 
even if the latter is known. This means that there can be multiple V (r)’s for the same 
ρ1,g(r). Thus, let us take two potentials V (r) and V 
(r), which differ by more than a 
constant but correspond to the same ρ1,g(r). Let us denote the electronic Hamiltonian 
for the two potentials asHˆel and Hˆ 
el. Note that the following relationship between these 
two Hamiltonians holds: 
Hˆel − Hˆ 
el = V (rˆ) − V 
(rˆ). (11.78) 
Let us also denote the ground electronic states for the two Hamiltonians respectively 
as |e,g and |
e,g, which however corresponds to the same ρ1,g(r). Since the two 
potentials differ by more than a constant, |e,g and |
e,g should be different. 
Let us first consider the fact that E
el,g is the eigenvalue of the ground electronic state 
|
e,g for Hˆ 
el. As shown in Chap. 7, this means the following inequality: 
E
el,g = 
e,g|Hˆ 

e,g
< e,g|Hˆ 
|e,g=e,g|(Hˆ + Vˆ  − V )ˆ |e,g
= Eel,g +
#
dr ρ1,g(r)(V 
(r) − V (r)), (11.79) 
where the fact that the effect of the potential can be fully accounted for by the single 
electron density has been used. Similarly, switching between the two states above, we 
also find that 
Eel,g = e,g|Hˆ |e,g
< 
e,g|Hˆ |
e,g=
e,g|(Hˆ  − Vˆ  + V )ˆ |

= E
el,g −
#
dr ρ1,g(r)(V 
(r) − V (r)). (11.80)384 11 Theories for Electronic Structure Calculation of Polyatomic Molecules
Adding the above two quantities, we find that 
E
el,g + Eel,g < Eel,g + E
el,g, (11.81) 
which is contradictory. This means that V (r) is uniquely determined up to an additive 
constant factor onceρ1,g(r) is known. Thus,V (r) is a unique functional ofρ1,g(r). 
Since |e,g or Eel,g is a unique functional of V (r), the above theorem implies 
that it is also a unique functional of the ground state single electron density. This 
theorem leads to the density functional theory (DFT) [ 50] as summarized below. 
Density Functional Theory (DFT) 
• According to Hohenberg and Kohn [ 49], for a given system of fixed number of 
electrons, the ground state energy (up to an additive constant factor) is a unique 
functional of the single electron density. This implies that, if the exact form of 
the functional is known, only the information on the density is sufficient to 
determine the energy. However, this theorem is limited to the case where the 
energy can be represented as a unique functional of an external potential V (r), 
which does not necessarily account for all possible electron densities. 
• Mel Levy developed a general theorem [ 51], which overcame the limitation 
of the theorem by Hohenberg and Kohn and proved the existence of a 
universal functional for the ground state energy as a constrained minimum. 
This extended the applicability of DFT significantly. 
• Kohn and Sham [52] used the variational theorem and derived the following 
effective one-electron equation:

(11.82) 
where atomic units were used and n(r) = Ne

2, and Exc(n(r)) is 
the functional of exchange interaction. The above equation can be solved 
iteratively as long as the form of Exc(n(r)) is known. This approach is known 
as Kohn-Sham DFT and has served as the major approach in the application of 
DFT. 
DFT as stated above is a powerful theory that allows calculation of almost infinite 
number of many electron systems by a simple set of equations if the exact functional 
form is known. This is a beautiful theoretical statement, but the exact form of the 
functional is impossible to know in practice. Over many decades, great advances 
have been made in devising approximate but fairly accurate forms of functional, 
which have established the DFT method as one of the most efficient and reliable 
electronic structure calculation methods [ 50, 53, 54].11.3 Summary and Questions 385
Later, further extension of the above proof for the cases of time dependent 
potential was established, leading to time dependent DFT (TD-DFT) theory [ 55].
This theory states that any time dependent potential energy that can be expanded as 
polynomials of time variable can be shown to be a functional of the single electron 
density, which in turn allows calculation of the excited state properties in terms of 
the single electron density as well. Actual proof of TD-DFT is more involved and 
the implementation of the resulting TD-DFT method also requires additional set 
of new assumptions and approximations. As yet, this method has also made great 
progress and is now considered as one of the leading computational methods for the 
calculation of excited state properties. 
11.3 Summary and Questions 
For a many-electron state given by a Slater determinant of orthogonal single 
electron spin-orbit states such as Eq. ( 11.4), the expectation value of the electronic 
Hamiltonian, Eq. (11.11), is expressed as a sum of single electron and two electron 
terms. The latter two electron terms in turn consist of Coulomb interactions between 
electrons, which have classical analogues, and exchange interaction terms that have 
negative sign originating from the Pauli exclusion principle. Thus, these exchange 
interaction terms have purely quantum mechanical origin and are responsible for 
unique quantum mechanical properties of many-electron systems. 
The simplification of the total electronic energy for many electron states, even 
though the Slater determinant involves all electronic states, reflects that the potential 
energy of the Hamiltonian has only one and two electron interactions. It is also 
an outcome of the orthogonality of single electron states, which changes only 
the coefficient of the Slater determinant and does not restrict the nature of many 
electron Slater determinant state. On the other hand, it is important that the condition 
of orthogonality has to be actually incorporated as constraints in applying the 
variational principle. 
Application of the Lagrange multiplier method to combine the minimum energy 
requirement and the orthogonality condition, leads to a general form of the HF 
equation, Eq. (11.26). Further simplification of this equation into a canonical form, 
Eq. (11.34), can be made using the fact the a unitary transformation diagonalizing 
the Lagrange multiplier matrix  can be applied to single electron states, which 
does not alter the Slater determinant except for a numerical factor of unit magnitude. 
The canonical HF equation has the appearance of standard eigenvalue problem, but 
it in fact needs to be determined self consistently because both the Coulomb and 
exchange interaction operators are functionals of one-electron spin-orbit states yet 
to be determined. 
Considering the types of spin states more explicitly, it is possible to reduce the 
canonical HF into a form that involves only spatial orbitals. For the case of singlet 
many-electron states where all the spatial orbitals are doubly occupied, the resulting 
expression is given by Eq. ( 11.49). In this expression, Coulomb terms have a factor386 11 Theories for Electronic Structure Calculation of Polyatomic Molecules
of 2 multiplied, which reflect two possible cases of single electron spins up and 
down that do not affect the spatial integral of the Coulomb potential energy. On the 
other hand, the exchange interaction terms do not have that factor. This is because 
the exchange interaction terms become zero when the two spin-orbit states being 
exchanged have opposite, thus orthogonal, spin states. 
For developing efficient and general methods for solving the HF equation, it is 
convenient to introduce basis states that can represent single electron orbital states 
as their linear combinations. For a general nonorthogonal basis, the HF equation 
can thus be converted into a HF-Roothaan equation, Eq. ( 11.58), which are more 
amenable for numerical iterative procedures. In combination with the development 
of practical and efficient ways to construct a general class of basis functions, the 
HF method has been established as one of the most successful approaches for 
calculating the ground electronic state energy and determining the structure of 
polyatomic molecules. The HF method also serves as the starting point for more 
advanced calculations for general electronic states. 
Alternatively, it is possible to express the electronic energy in terms of single 
and two electron densities as in Eq. ( 11.77). According to the proof by Hohenberg 
and Kohn, the ground electronic state energy can in fact be defined as a unique 
functional of a single electron density. This reduces calculating the ground state 
energy of many-electron system into determining the universal functional and the 
electron density that minimizes the energy for a given system, leading to the DFT 
method that serve as an important alternative to the direct wavefunction formulation. 
Extension of this perspective to the case of time dependent external potential led to 
the TD-DFT method, which now serves as one of the most widely approaches used 
for calculating the excited states of many polyatomic molecules.

Special Topics 
No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do 
something about it. 
– Richard P. Feynman 
Abstract This chapter introduces three special topics as follows: (i) path integral 
representation of quantum dynamics and equilibrium properties; (ii) open system 
quantum dynamics and quantum master equation approaches; (iii) Green’s function 
approach. These topics have played important roles in theoretical and computational 
investigation of quantum processes in complex environments. Some of the core 
concepts and relations will be derived and explained. 
Three special topics being introduced in this chapter serve as important theoretical 
tools for investigating quantum processes in complex environments and for manipu￾lating quantum effects beyond simple measurement processes. Each of these topics 
has a long history of its own and has been developed for decades. Thus, even a 
reasonable overview of these topics requires substantial effort that goes beyond the 
scope of this book. Rather, a few key concepts, identities, and relations that can help 
readers gain better understanding and develop reasonable perspective of these topics 
will be presented. Due to informative nature and incompleteness of presentations 
here, no summary or problems are provided in this chapter. 
12.1 Path Integral Representation 
Both the time evolution operator of a quantum system and the density operator of 
a canonical ensemble can in general be expressed in forms of path integrals [16, 
17, 56, 57]. This is because the latter can be obtained from the former by using 
t = −iβh¯. Although development of a path integral expression is possible with 
respect to any complete basis [17, 57], the most well-known and powerful basis is

that of position states. Thus, we will consider here only conventional path integrals 
in position basis. 
12.1.1 Real Time Propagator 
Take for example the time evolution operator for a time independent Hamiltonian, 
given by Eq. (2.47), in one dimension. For the corresponding time evolution operator 
UˆH (t) defined by Eq. (2.82), let us introduce the following real time propagator 
between xi and xf : 
P (xf , t; xi, 0) ≡ xf |UˆH (t)|xi=xf |e−itH /ˆ h¯ |xi. (12.1) 
The time evolution operator shown above can be expressed as a product of Np
propagators for smaller time steps. Thus, 
e−itH /ˆ h¯ = e−iδtH /ˆ h¯ ··· e−iδtH /ˆ h¯ , (12.2) 
where δt = t/Np. Inserting the identity resolution in position space, Eq. (2.25), 
Np − 1 times in between each time evolution operator for δt, we can express 
Eq. (12.1) as 
P (xf , t; xi, 0) =

dx1 ··· 
dxNP −1

Np
k=1
P (xk, tk; xk−1, tk−1), (12.3) 
where xNp = xf , x0 = xi, and tk = tδt for k = 0, ··· , Np. 
For small enough δt, one can make the following Trotter factorization [58] 
approximation for each time evolution operator for δt. 
e−iδtH /ˆ h¯ = e−iδtV /( ˆ 2h)¯ e−iδtT /ˆ h¯ e−iδtV /( ˆ 2h)¯ + O(δt3), (12.4) 
where O(δt3) implies that the error for the above Trotter factorization is of order 
δt3. Within this approximation, the corresponding propagator can be calculated 
employing the identity resolution in the momentum space, Eq. (2.34), as follows:

In the above expression, x(·) represents a given function x(τ ) as a whole defined for 
the entire domain of time, τ . The dot · is used as an argument here to distinguish it 
from a particular value of the function at a certain time t.

where dots within parentheses imply any functional that is well defined and remains 
integrable as the discrete trajectory becomes continuous. Whether this limit of path 
integration is well defined is a nontrivial mathematical issue and also has practical 
significance. For example, for a free particle or a particle subject to a potential 
bounded from below, it is generally accepted that the path integral is well-defined as 
the limit of the multidimensional integration. However, for singular potentials such 
as Coulomb potential, it is not the case and more careful definition of the measure 
of integration1 becomes necessary [17]. 
Since t3/N2
P becomes zero in the limit of NP → ∞ for any finite value of t, the 
error term in Eq. (12.8) becomes zero in that limit. Thus, we obtain the following 
path integral expression for the propagator: 
P (xf , t; xi, 0) =
 x(t)=xf
x(0)=xi
Dx(·)eiA[x(·);t]/h¯ . (12.12)

measure produces convergent result. 12.1 Path Integral Representation 395

Extension of expressions derived here to general multidimensional Cartesian 
coordinates is straightforward [17, 57]. However, for curvilinear coordinates or 
for cases with cyclic coordinates such as angles, care should be taken for proper 
definition of path measures [17]. 
12.1.2 Imaginary Time Propagator 
Let us consider the canonical equilibrium density operator, Eq. (10.63), which can 
also be expressed as 
ρˆβ = e−i(−ihβ) ¯ H /ˆ h¯
T r 
e−i(−ihβ) ¯ H /ˆ h¯
. (12.16) 
Thus, the path integral expression for the canonical equilibrium density operator can 
be obtained by simply replacing t with −ihβ¯ . Let us introduce an imaginary time tI
such that396 12 Special Topics
t = −itI , 0 ≤ tI ≤ hβ¯ (12.17) 
Then, the definition of the real time propagator, Eq. (12.1), can be extended to an 
imaginary time propagator as follows: 
xf |e−βHˆ
|xi = P (xf , −iβh¯; xi, 0) = xf |e−i(−iβh)¯ H /ˆ h¯ |xi. (12.18) 
Thus, the action given by Eq. (12.9) can be extended to the imaginary time at 
tI = βh¯, by simply replacing the time integration variable τ with −iτ and also 
introducing xe(τ ) ≡ x(−iτ), as follows:

(12.19) 
where E[xe(·); βh¯] is called Euclidean action and is equal to the average energy 
along the path time leading to βh¯. Note that xe(τ ) and x(−iτ) are the same except 
that the former is viewed as a function of a real valued parameter τ whereas the latter 
is viewed as that of an imaginary time −iτ . Thus, the imaginary time propagator 
defined by Eq. (12.18) can be expressed by the following path integral form:

Equations (12.20) and (12.21) complete the derivation of the path integral repre￾sentation for the imaginary time propagator. Alternatively, these expressions can be 
obtained directly by expressing e−βHˆ as a product of those for higher temperature, 
e−Hˆ
, where  = β/NP = 1/(kBT NP ). Application of the Trotter factorization for 
each of e−Hˆ as in Eq. (12.4), conducting Gaussian integration as in Eq. (12.6), but 
for δt = −iβh/N ¯ P , and sending the limit of NP → ∞ directly leads to Eqs. (12.20) 
and (12.21).12.2 Quantum Master Equation for Open System Quantum Dynamics 397

where the path integration in the last line represents sum over all the cyclic paths that 
end at the same position as the starting point. Combining Eqs. (12.22) and (12.23), 
we thus obtain the following path integral expression for the canonical equilibrium

Extension of the expressions derived above to the case of multidimensional 
Cartesian coordinate system is straightforward [17, 57]. As is the case with the 
time evolution operator, mathematical difficulty arises in identifying correct path 
measure for curvilinear or cyclic coordinates [17]. 
12.2 Quantum Master Equation for Open System Quantum 
Dynamics 
Consider a quantum system interacting with its environment. Assume that we are 
interested only in the net effects of the environment on the system and are not 
concerned about details of the environment. For these cases, it may be possible398 12 Special Topics
to develop ways to consider a reduced quantum dynamics for the system only 
while only accounting for the net effects of the environment on the system. To 
what extent is this approach feasible? How can one identify the whole environment 
and its interaction with the system of interest? These are some of difficult and 
fundamental questions that still remain active issues of research in open system 
quantum dynamics. However, in this section, we will bypass asking such questions 
and simply assume that it is possible to identify the environment, which will be 
called bath, and its interaction with the system of interest. 
To be more specific, let us assume that it is possible to identify a well-defined 
system Hamiltonian Hˆs, a bath Hamiltonian Hˆb, and a system-bath interaction 
Hamiltonian Hˆsb, which are all defined in the direct product space of the system 
and the bath and can be added together to define a total Hamiltonian as follows: 
Hˆ = Hˆs + Hˆsb + Hˆb = Hˆ0 + Hˆ1, (12.26) 
where, in the second equality, we have also introduced the zeroth order reference 
Hamiltonian, Hˆ0, and the first order term Hˆ1 that is assumed to be small2 compared 
to Hˆ0. Definitions of these can vary depending on the nature of the problem. If Hˆsb
is small, defining Hˆ0 = Hˆs + Hˆb and Hˆ1 = Hˆsb is a natural choice. However, an 
alternative choice is possible if Hˆsb is not small enough. 
Given that the system and bath as a whole is completely isolated from the rest 
of the universe, the time evolution of the total density operator representing the 
sum of system and bath at time t is determined according to the following quantum 
Liouville equation: 
d
dt ρ(t) ˆ = −iLρ(t) ˆ
= −i (Ls + Lsb + Lb) ρ(t) ˆ
= −i (L0 + L1) ρ(t). ˆ (12.27) 
In the above expression, L(···) = [H,( ˆ ···)]/h¯ and Lα(···) = [Hˆα, (···)]/h¯, for 
each of α = s, sb, b, and 0, respectively. 
There are two major approaches to reduce the dynamics of the total density 
operator represented by Eq. (12.27) into that involving only the system degree 
of freedom. One is to use the path integral influence functional approach, which 
accounts for the net effect of the bath on the system dynamics in the path integral 
representation of the density operator. This is a powerful approach that has widely 
been used in the condensed matter physics and remains a promising approach for 
simulating molecular systems, but is not described here. Readers can refer to an 
excellent monograph [59] and a review paper [60] on this approach. The other
2 The meaning of “small" here is the extension of the concept used in the perturbation theory in 
that the effects of Hˆ1 on the eigenstates of Hˆ0 are small. 12.2 Quantum Master Equation for Open System Quantum Dynamics 399
approach is to use a quantum master equation (QME) [37, 61–64], which has longer 
history and has been well-established as one of the most general approaches for 
investigating open system quantum dynamics. 
One of the most systematic approaches to derive QMEs is to employ a projection 
super-operator in the interaction picture with respect to the zeroth order Hamilto￾nian. For this, let us first introduce the density operator in the interaction picture 
with respect to Hˆ0 as follows: 
ρˆI (t) = eiHˆ0t/h¯ ρ(t)e ˆ −iHˆ0t/h¯ . (12.28) 
The dynamics of this is governed by the following interaction picture quantum 
Liouville equation: 
d
dt ρˆI (t) = iL0ρˆI (t) − eiHˆ0t/h¯ (iL0 + iL1) ρ(t)e ˆ −iHˆ0t/h¯
= −eiHˆ0t/h¯ iL1ρ(t)e ˆ −iHˆ0t/h¯
= − i
h¯
[Hˆ1,I (t), ρI (t)]≡−iL1,I (t)ρˆI (t), (12.29) 
where Hˆ1,I (t) = eiHˆ0t/h¯Hˆ1e−iHˆ0t/h¯ . 
12.2.1 Projection Operator Formalism and Exact Time 
Evolution Equations for a Projected Density Operator 
If only a partial information on the density operator is needed, a projection super￾operator P, which is assumed to be time independent, can be introduced such that 
PρˆI (t) contains all such information. The complement of the projection super￾operator is denoted as Q = 1 − P. So, let us call PρˆI (t) the projected part of the 
density operator and QρˆI (t) the unprojected part of the density operator. First, we 
will show that a general exact time evolution equation involving only the projected 
part of the density operator can be derived without detailed specification of the form 
of the projection super-operator. In deriving this, it is convenient to assume that the 
following identity holds: 
PL1,I (t)P = 0. (12.30) 
It is important to note that the above condition is not so restrictive and can always 
be satisfied by an appropriate definition of Hˆ1. As will be clear, this identity helps to 
simplify final expression for the formal solution and its perturbative approximations.400 12 Special Topics
Applying P on the left-hand side of Eq. (12.29), inserting the identity P+Q = 1ˆ
between L1,I (t) and ρˆI (t), and employing the identity of Eq. (12.30), we obtain 
d
dt PρˆI (t) = −iPL1,I (t)QρˆI (t). (12.31) 
Similarly, applying Q on the left-hand side of Eq. (12.29) and inserting the identity 
of P + Q = 1ˆ, we also obtain 
d
dt QρˆI (t) = −iQL1,I (t)QρˆI (t) − iQL1,I (t)PρˆI (t). (12.32) 
A formal solution of the above equation can be found easily. For this, it is convenient 
to introduce time ordered exponential super-operators as described below.

The validity of Eq. (12.40) as the solution of Eq. (12.32) can also be proven by direct 
substitution. 
Note that Eq. (12.40) expresses QρˆI (t) in terms of PρˆI (τ ) for 0 ≤ τ ≤ t and the 
initial value of the unprojected part of the density operator at t = 0. Thus, when this 
expression is used in Eq. (12.31), we obtain a closed form of differential equation 
for PρˆI (t) as summarized below. 
Exact Time-Nonlocal Evolution Equation for the Projected Part of the 
Density Operator 
Using Eq. (12.40) in Eq. (12.31), we obtain the following time evolution 
equation for the projected part of the density operator:

where the inhomogeneous term (the second term) retains the information on 
the initial preparation of the system and the bath at t = 0. Note that the 
above expression involves only the positively time ordered exponential super￾operator involving QL1,I (t). Thus, as long as this is well defined, the above 
solution is also well-defined and valid. 
The time evolution equation, Eq. (12.42), is non-local in time and shows that 
even calculating the time derivative of PρˆI (t) requires full information on its past. 
This is not unexpected since the effect of the bath on the dynamics of the system 
builds up over the history of its time evolution. However, it turns out that it is also 
possible to account for such memory effect employing a fully time local form. This 
is because the full dynamics for ρˆI (t) is unitary and can be reversed backward. That 
is, one can always find a formally exact solution for Eq. (12.29), which can relate 
ρˆI (t) to ρˆI (τ ) for τ ≤ t as follows:

Note that the righthand side of the above equation involves the information 
on PρˆI (t) only at the same time as that for the lefthand side. This is achieved 
by expressing the information on ρˆI (τ ) for τ ≤ t in terms of ρˆI (t) by 
evolving backward in time and then dividing their effects on projected and 
unprojected parts again. As a result, the final forms of super-operators in the 
above expression is more complicated than those in Eq. (12.42). 
Equations (12.42) and (12.48) are both exact and general for any form of 
the Liouville and projection super-operators. Alternative methods to derive these 
equations exist as well. For example, one can employ the generalized cumulant 
expansion method [66] for the total density operator and then apply chronological 
time ordering or partial time ordering prescription [67, 68]. 
12.2.2 Quantum Master Equations for a Reduced System 
Density Operator 
If we are interested in finding out the general information on the system of interest, 
we need to be able to determine at least the reduced system density operator defined 
as 
ρˆs,I (t) ≡ T rb{ ˆρI (t)}. (12.49) 
For this, we can introduce the following projection super-operator [37, 62–64]: 
P(·) ≡ ˆρb ⊗ T rb {(·)} = ˆρbT rb {(·)}, (12.50) 
where ρˆb is a bath density operator, which is commonly assumed to be an 
equilibrium density operator, and the second equality is a short notation for the 
direct product form. In addition, let us define the zeroth order and the first order 
Hamiltonians as follows: 
Hˆ0 = Hˆs + Hˆb, (12.51) 
Hˆ1 = Hˆsb. (12.52) 
Then, the time evolution operator for Hˆ0 can be expressed as 
Uˆ0(t) = e−iHˆs/h¯ e−iHˆbt/h¯ . (12.53)12.2 Quantum Master Equation for Open System Quantum Dynamics 405
Therefore, 
Hˆ1,I (t) = Hˆsb,I (t) = eiHˆst/h¯ eiHˆbt/h¯Hˆsbe−iHˆbt/h¯ e−iHˆst/h¯ . (12.54) 
For the above case, the condition of Eq. (12.30) implies that, for any operator Oˆ that 
depends on both system and bath degrees of freedom, the following identity holds.

12.2.2.2 Second Order QMEs 
The kernel in time-nonlocal QME, the relaxation super-operator in time-local 
QME, and the inhomogeneous terms in both equations can be expanded in terms 
of Hˆsb,I (t). The lowest order approximations with respect to Hˆsb,I (t) for both 
equations in the interaction picture are of second order. 
Let us first consider the time-nonlocal QME, Eq. (12.60). Keeping only terms 
up to the second order of Lsb,I (t) in Eqs. (12.61) and (12.62), and employing the 
identity of Eq. (12.30), we obtain the following second order approximations for the 
terms involved in the time-nonlocal QME,

For the time-local QME, Eq. (12.65), similar 2nd order approximations can be 
made in Eqs. (12.66) and (12.67) as follows:

Thus, the relaxation super-operator for the 2nd order time-local QME is equal 
to the integration of the kernel of the 2nd order time-nonlocal QME, while the 
inhomogeneous terms for both equations are the same. 
In the Schrödinger picture, the corresponding second order equations can 
be obtained by using the above second order approximations in Eqs. (12.63)12.2 Quantum Master Equation for Open System Quantum Dynamics 409
and (12.68). Before presenting these equations, it is instructive to consider a generic 
form of the system-bath interaction Hamiltonian given by 
Hˆsb = 	
n
Sˆ
nBˆn, (12.74) 
where Sˆ
n and Bˆn are not necessarily Hermitian. Since Hˆsb is Hermitian, this means 
that the sum should also includes those for Hermitian conjugates of Sˆ
n and Bˆn in 
such cases. With this convention, Hˆsb given by Eq. (12.74) can now represent a wide 
range of system-bath interactions. 
In the interaction picture, 
Hˆsb,I (t) = 	
n
Sˆ
n,I (t)Bˆn,I (t). (12.75) 
where 
Sˆ
n,I (t) = eiHˆst/h¯ Sˆ
ne−iHˆst/h¯ , (12.76) 
Bˆn,I (t) = eiHˆbt/h¯Bˆne−iHˆbt/h¯ . (12.77)

simply the integration of Kˆ (2)

The approach of deriving second order approximations described above can be 
extended further to derive higher order perturbative approximations in both time￾nonlocal and time-local forms [37, 69, 70]. However, such perturbative expansions 
result in much more complicated expressions in general while they may not lead to 
significant improvements. Rather, approaches to account for terms up to the infinite 
order (in principle) through hierarchy of equations of motion approach [71–74] or an 
approach to solve unprojected part through numerical solution of integral equation, 
which is called generalized QME [75, 76], have been more successful. Alternatively, 
it is possible to account for some higher order terms through unitary transformation 
that effectively reduces the system-bath interaction, while still using the second 
order approximation [77, 78]. 
12.3 Green’s Function Approach 
Mathematically, Green’s function is an inverse of a differential operator and 
enables finding the solution of an inhomogeneous differential equation employing 
those for the homogeneous equation [30, 79, 80]. Let us consider the following 
inhomogeneous differential equation, 
L(ξ )f (ξ ) ˆ = S(ξ ), (12.89) 
where L(ξ ) ˆ is a differential operator with ξ as a variable and S(ξ ) is the source 
term. Although one dimensional notation is used here, ξ can be multidimensional in 
general. For example, ξ can represent either the time or spatial coordinates, or both12.3 Green’s Function Approach 413
of them. Green function for the above differential equation is defined as the solution 
of the following equation with a delta function source term. 
L(ξ )G(ξ , ξ ˆ 
) = δ(ξ − ξ 
). (12.90) 
Then, the general solution of Eq. (12.89) can be expressed as follows: 
f (ξ ) = fh(ξ ) +

dξ 
G(ξ , ξ 
)S(ξ 
), (12.91) 
where fh(ξ ) is the homogeneous solution of the differential equation such that 
L(ξ )f ˆ h(ξ ) = 0. The fact that f (ξ ) given above indeed is a solution of Eq. (12.89) 
is shown below.

δ(ξ − ξ 

) = S(ξ ).
(12.92) 
Employing Green’s function is convenient because it can incorporate boundary 
conditions within its form. In addition, solutions involving Green’s functions are 
easier to develop systematic approximations. 
Green’s function can also be used for obtaining (or approximating) the homoge￾nous solution of a complicated differential operator in terms of those for simpler 
ones. For example, assume that the differential operator L(ξ ) ˆ can be divided into 
two terms, 
L(ξ ) ˆ = Lˆ 0(ξ ) + Lˆ 1(ξ ), (12.93) 
and that the Green function for Lˆ 0(ξ ), which is denoted as G0(ξ , ξ 
), can be 
obtained easily. Then, the differential equation for the homogeneous solution for 
L(ξ ) ˆ can be expressed as 
Lˆ 0(ξ )f (ξ ) = −Lˆ 1(ξ )f (ξ ). (12.94) 
Treating the righthand side of the above equation as a source term, we can express 
the solution f (ξ ) in term of G0(ξ , ξ 
) as 
f (ξ ) = f0(ξ ) −

ds
G0(ξ , ξ 
)Lˆ 1(ξ 
)f (ξ 
). (12.95) 
Although the above equation still involves unknown f (ξ 
) on the righthand side, a 
formal solution can be obtained by iterating the righthand side as follows:414 12 Special Topics
f (ξ ) = f0(ξ ) −

dξn G0(ξ , ξ1)Lˆ 1(ξ1)··· G0(ξn−1, ξn)Lˆ 1(ξn)f0(ξn)
+··· . (12.96) 
Given that the above series converge quickly, one can truncate the above expansion 
at finite order, obtaining a perturbative approximation. More advanced approaches 
are to employ integral transformation and/or diagrammatic techniques [18] to 
account for major terms up to an infinite order. 
The standard Green’s function in quantum mechanics refers to that for the 
Schrödinger equation and has played an important role in scattering and dynamics 
problems [3, 17, 81]. In fact, the real and imaginary time propagators defined in the 
path integral representation can also be viewed as examples of Green’s function. 
However, more generally, Green’s function approach in quantum mechanics 
often refers to a general class of powerful technique to solve quantum many 
body problems in combination with quantum field theory [18, 81]. Operational 
definitions of Green’s functions in this approach are correlation functions of field 
operators, which retain all the major spatiotemporal dynamics of quantum particles 
in interacting environments and can be used for the calculation of all the relevant 
physical properties. The remainder of this section will provide a very brief account 
of this approach, starting from the definition of field operators. For comprehensive 
accounts of theoretical basis and important technical details of the Green’s function 
approach, readers are strongly recommended to refer to more advanced references 
[18, 82]. 
12.3.1 Second Quantization and Field Operators 
Let us consider the lowering and raising operators bˆ and bˆ† for a harmonic 
oscillator as defined by Eqs. (3.51) and (3.52) in Chap. 3. The two operators satisfy 
Eqs. (3.53)–(3.55) and can be used to express the Hamiltonian as Eq. (3.57). For a 
given eigenstate |v of the harmonic oscillator, application of bˆ† produces |v + 1
according to Eq. (3.67) and application of bˆ to |v produces |v − 1 according to 
Eq. (3.70). 
In the second quantization formulation of quantum mechanics, each eigenstate 
|v of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian can be viewed as a state with v number 
of phonons. Then, the ground vibrational state |0 can be defined as the “vacuum" 
state of phonons and bˆ† and bˆ now become creation and annihilation operators 
of phonons. This view of quantum harmonic oscillator is equivalent to the one12.3 Green’s Function Approach 415
described in Chap. 3 and allows expressing all physical observables and states only 
in terms of products of bˆ’s and bˆ†’s applied to the vacuum state. 
The second quantization formulation is particularly useful when there are many 
(possibly infinite number of) harmonic oscillator normal modes because there is 
no need to introduce eigenstates with many (possibly infinite number of) indices. 
Instead, for a system of Ns independent harmonic oscillator normal modes, we can 
define bˆ†
j and bˆ
j , with j = 1, ··· , Ns, as the creation and annihilation operators of 
a phonon for each mode. 
Phonons for each mode are identical particles satisfying boson statistics. In fact, 
the definition of creation and annihilation operators for phonons can be extended to 
other types of bosons as well. For this, it is first necessary to define the occupation 
number space of bosons. Let us introduce a state in the occupation number space, 
|n1, ··· , nk, ··· , nNs  : A quantum state where there are n1 particles
in state 1, ··· , nk particles in state k, ···
and nNs particles in state Ns (12.97) 
Then, the creation and annihilation operators for bosons in the kth state, which are 
in general denoted as bˆ†
k and bˆ
k, can be defined as described below. 
Creation and Annihilation Operators for Bosons 
For the state in the occupation number space defined by Eq. (12.97), creation 
and annihilation operators for bosons in the kth state are defined by 
bˆ†
k |n1, ··· , nk, ··· , nNs  = 
nk + 1|n1, ··· , nk + 1, ··· , nNs , (12.98) 
bˆ
k|n1, ··· , nk, ··· , nNs  = √nk|n1, ··· , nk − 1, ··· , nNs , (12.99) 
and satisfy the following commutator identities: 
[bˆ
j , bˆ†
k ] = δjk, (12.100) 
[bˆ† 
j , bˆ† 
k ]=[bˆ
j , bˆ
k] = 0. (12.101) 
Then, the state in the occupation number space, Eq. (12.97), can be expressed 
as 
|n1, ··· , nk, ··· , nNs  = 
Ns
k=1
1
√nk!

bˆ†
k
nk
|vac, (12.102) 
where |vac is the vacuum state without any boson particles occupying the 
states. Note that the above definition is independent of the order of creation 
operators for different indices because they commute with each other.416 12 Special Topics
The creation and annihilation operators introduced above define a number 
operator nˆk = ˆa†
kaˆk for bosons in the state k as follows: 
bˆ†
kbˆ
k|n1, ··· , nk, ··· , nNs  = nk|n1, ··· , nk, ··· , nNs , (12.103) 
which can be shown directly by consecutive applications of Eqs. (12.98) 
and (12.99). 
The creation and annihilation operators defined above can also be used for 
photons, which are bosons, for each frequency and polarization direction. If photons 
are confined in a small volume, only certain frequencies satisfying the boundary 
conditions are allowed. Thus, the states of photons in such case are discrete. 
However, as the volume becomes infinite, the spectrum of photon frequencies 
becomes continuous and the corresponding Hamiltonian of light involves integration 
over the entire frequency range. 
For fermions such as electrons, the occupation number state such as Eq. (12.97) 
can still be used. However, the number of particles in each state can be only either 
0 or 1. In addition, exchange of the states of two particles should result in change 
of the sign of the state. All of these properties can be naturally encoded by defining 
creation and annihilation operators satisfying different identities as described below. 
Creation and Annihilation Operators for Fermions 
Creation and annihilation operators for states r and s of fermions, aˆ
†
r and aˆs, 
satisfy the following anti-commutation relationship: 
{ ˆa†
r , aˆs}≡ ˆa†
r aˆs + ˆasaˆ †
r = δrs. (12.104) 
On the other hand, between annihilation or creation operators, the following 
anti-commutation identities hold. 
{ ˆar, aˆs} = {ˆa†
r , aˆ †
s } = 0. (12.105) 
Then, the state, Eq. (12.97), can be expressed as 
|n1, ··· , nr, ··· , nNs  = (aˆ
†
1 )
n1 (aˆ
†
2 )
n2 ···(aˆ †
s )
ns ···(aˆ †
Ns
)
nNs |vac,
(12.106) 
where |vac is the vacuum state without any fermion particles occupying the 
states and each nr = 0 or 1.12.3 Green’s Function Approach 417
Equation (12.105) for r = s implies that aˆ 2
s = ˆa†2
s = 0 for each s. On the other 
hand, Eq. (12.104) for r = s implies that aˆ
†
s aˆs = 1− ˆasaˆ
†
s . Thus, combining the two 
cases, we find that 
(aˆ †
s aˆs)
2 = ˆa†
s aˆs − ˆa†
s aˆ 2
s aˆ †
s = ˆa†
s aˆs. (12.107) 
The above identity is true only if the eigenvalue of aˆ
†
s aˆs is either 0 or 1. Thus, the 
number operator for each state s in this case is given by nˆs = ˆa†
s aˆs as well. On the 
other hand, the number operators for different states (r = s) commute with each 
other as shown below. 
[ ˆnr, nˆs]= ˆa†
r aˆraˆ †
s aˆs − ˆa†
s aˆsaˆ †
r aˆr = −ˆa†
r aˆ †
s aˆraˆs − ˆa†
s aˆsaˆ †
r aˆr
= ˆa†
r aˆ †
s aˆsaˆr − ˆa†
s aˆsaˆ †
r aˆr = −ˆa†
s aˆ †
r aˆsaˆr − ˆa†
s aˆsaˆ †
r aˆr
= ˆa†
s aˆsaˆ †
r aˆr − ˆa†
s aˆsaˆ †
r aˆr = 0. (12.108) 
This means that simultaneous diagonalization of any set of the nˆr is possible, which 
validates the occupation number state defined by Eq. (12.106). 
In general, creation of a single boson or fermion particle does not have to be 
limited to a specific state but can be any linear superposition of those for different 
states. In addition, it is often useful to have a definite spatial information on 
the created particle because interactions between particles are local in space, in 
particular, for actual particles such as electrons. For this reason, it is useful to 
consider a general linear combination of creation or annihilation operators projected 
onto the position space. These are called field operators and are defined below. 
Field Operators 
Field operators are linear combinations of creation or annihilation operators 
defined as 
ψ(ˆ r) = 	
k
ψk(r)cˆk, (12.109) 
ψˆ †(r) = 	
k
ψ† 
k (r)cˆ
† 
k , (12.110) 
where cˆk and cˆ
†
k are annihilation and creation operators for either bosons 
or fermions, and ψk(r) is the wavefunction (or vector of wavefunctions for 
particles with nonzero spins) for the state k. it is assumed that the summation 
index k runs over a complete set of single-particle quantum states.418 12 Special Topics
For the case of bosons, the field operators defined above satisfy the following 
commutator identity: 
[ψ(ˆ r), ψˆ †(r
)] = 	
k

ψk(r)ψ∗

On the other hand, for fermions with spin half such as electrons, the field operator 
defined above satisfy the following anti-commutator identity: 

ψˆ γ (r), ψˆ †
γ (r

 = δγ γ δ(r − r
), (12.112) 
where γ , γ  represent either spin up or down. 
The field operators defined above can be used to represent physical observables. 
For example, the operator for any one-body function given by a sum of all the 
particles, A = 
j A(rj ), can be expressed as 
Aˆ =

dr ψˆ †(r)A(r)ψ(ˆ r). (12.113) 
It is also possible to prove that the Hamiltonian operator for identical particles of 
mass m subject to external potential vext(r) and with pair-wise interaction potential 
Vint(r, r
) can be expressed as 
Hˆ =

dr

12.3.2 Ground State (Zero Temperature) Green’s Functions 
For the total Hamiltonian Hˆ of an interacting many particle system, let us define 
time dependent field operators in the Heisenberg picture, 
ψˆH γ (rt) = eiHt/ ˆ h¯ ψˆ γ (r)e−iHt/ ˆ h¯ , (12.115) 
ψˆ † 
H γ (rt) = eiHt/ ˆ h¯ ψˆ † 
γ (r)e−iHt/ ˆ h¯ . (12.116)12.3 Green’s Function Approach 419
Then, the single particle Green’s function with respect to the normalized ground 
state |0 is defined as 
Gγ γ (rt, r
t

) ≡ −i0|T

ψˆH γ (r,t)ψˆ †
H γ (r
, t
)

|0, (12.117) 
where T is the chronological time ordering super-operator. Thus, the above Green’s 
functions can be expressed as 
Gγ γ (rt, r
t

) =

−i0|ψˆH γ (rt)ψˆ †
H γ (r
, t
)|0 ,t >t
∓i0|ψˆ †
H γ (r
, t
)ψˆH γ (rt)|0 , t > t
(12.118) 
In the second row on the righthand side of the above equation, the − sign is for 
bosons and the + sign is for fermions. This sign convention makes the above 
definition of Green’s function consistent with the commutator and anti-commutator 
identities of bosons and fermions, respectively. Green’s functions for two particle 
field operators can be defined in a similar manner. 
The Green’s function defined above provides direct information on the excitation 
properties. For example, in the Fourier transforms of this Green’s function with 
respect to time and position, the location and strength of poles respectively give 
direct information on excitation energies and strengths. Thus, in combination with 
powerful diagrammatic techniques [18] and more recently with direct numerical 
iteration techniques, which allow calculation of Green’s functions for interacting 
many-particle systems from those for simple reference systems, one can calculate 
the key properties related to ionizations or excitations without going through 
calculation of many-body wavefunctions. 
12.3.3 Nonequilibrium Green’s Functions 
Nonequilibrium Green’s functions serve as important tools for calculating transport 
properties [83, 84] in open environments including the case where there is particle 
exchange with reservoir. Within the Keldysh formalism [85], this can be done by 
defining contour ordered correlation functions of field operators. For this, let us 
omit writing explicitly the spatial coordinates and denote each operator in terms of 
time. Let us also drop the subscript H denoting the Heisenberg picture. 
For any nonequilibrium process that can be defined to have evolved from an 
equilibrium grand canonical distribution in the infinite past, one can define the 
following contour ordered Green’s function : 
G(τ, τ 
) = −iTc

ψ(τ ) ˆ ψˆ †(τ 
)

, (12.119) 
where · · ·  means trace over the grand canonical density operator at infinite past 
(t = −∞) and Tc is the normal time ordering operator along the closed time contour 
that starts from −∞ to ∞ and then comes back to −∞. In case τ comes later than 
τ  along the contour, G(τ, τ 
) becomes the following greater Green’s function:420 12 Special Topics
G>(τ, τ 
) = −iψ(τ ) ˆ ψˆ †(τ 
). (12.120) 
On the other hand, in case τ  comes later than τ along the contour, G(τ, τ 
) becomes 
the following lesser Green’s function: 
G<(τ, τ 
) = ∓iψˆ †(τ 
)ψ(τ ) ˆ . (12.121) 
where the − sign is for bosons and + sign is for fermions. Note that these greater 
and lesser Green’s functions are well defined even when the averaging is over the 
ground state. In fact, the two cases of Eq. (12.118) correspond to these greater and 
lesser Green’s functions. 
It is also useful to define retarded and advanced Green’s functions as follows: 
Gr
(τ, τ 
) = −i(τ − τ 
)ψ(τ ) ˆ ψˆ †(τ 
) + ψˆ †(τ 
)ψ(τ ) ˆ 
= (τ − τ 
)

G>(τ, τ 
) − G<(τ, τ 
)
 
, (12.122) 
Ga(τ, τ 
) = i(τ  − τ )ψ(τ ) ˆ ψˆ †(τ 
) + ψˆ †(τ 
)ψ(τ ) ˆ 
= (τ  − τ ) 
G<(τ, τ 
) − G>(τ, τ 
)
 
. (12.123) 
Finally, let us also define two regular time ordered Green functions defined along 
a straight real time line as follows: 
G(+)
(τ, τ 
) = −iT

ψ(τ ) ˆ ψˆ †(τ 
)

, (12.124) 
G(−)
(τ, τ 
) = −iT˜

ψ(τ ) ˆ ψˆ †(τ 
)

, (12.125) 
where T is the chronological time ordering super-operator and T˜ is the anti￾chronological time ordering super-operator. Then, we can show that 
G(+)
(τ, τ 
) = (τ − τ 
)G>(τ, τ 
) + (τ  − τ )G<(τ, τ 
),
(12.126) 
G(−)
(τ, τ 
) = (τ  − τ )G>(τ, τ 
) + (τ − τ 
)G<(τ, τ 
).
(12.127) 
Combining Eqs. (12.122), (12.123), (12.126), and (12.127), we can also establish 
the following identities: 
G<(τ, τ 
) = G(+)
(τ, τ 
) − Gr
(τ, τ 
)
= G(−)
(τ, τ 
) + Ga(τ, τ 
), (12.128) 
G>(τ, τ 
) = G(+)
(τ, τ 
) − Ga(τ, τ 
)
= G(−)
(τ, τ 
) + Gr
(τ, τ 
). (12.129)12.3 Green’s Function Approach 421
A great deal of dynamical properties in nonequilibrium processes can be 
expressed in terms of the following convolution of contour-order Green’s functions: 
A(τ, τ 
) =

c
dτ1B(τ, τ1)C(τ1, τ 
). (12.130) 
Langreth [86] showed that the above convolution can be related to those for standard 
types of Green functions employing a two-looped contour which passes through ∞
twice with t and t on each loop. Important examples of these are 
A<(t, t
) =
 ∞
−∞

(t, t1)C<(t1, t

) =
 ∞
−∞

B>(t, t1)Ca(t1, t
) + Br
(t, t1)C>(t1, t

Ar
(t, t

dt1Br
(t, t1)Cr
(t1, t
), (12.133) 
Aa(t, t

) =
 ∞
−∞
dt1Ba(t, t1)Ca(t1, t
). (12.134) 
Application of the above identities makes it possible to reduce expressions for 
nonequilibrium transport properties to those involving standard Green’s functions 
that have clear analogues in the equilibrium case and thus can be calculated 
extending well established techniques for equilibrium Green’s functions.References
