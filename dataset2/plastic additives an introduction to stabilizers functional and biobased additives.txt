https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110986358-2031 Introduction and a brief history of plastic
additives
Plastics, one of the most universal material classes, have outstanding properties
owing to their low weight, resulting in energy and CO2 saving in many industrial ap￾plications. They can be transformed into any desired shapes by various processes in a
low-cost, energy- and resource-saving manner. The synthesis of polymers can be done
from different sources such as oil and gas, as well as from renewable plant materials
and industrial or natural waste products. There are multiple recycling options to ful￾fill the requirements of a circular economy. The basis of plastics is polymers, high￾molecular-weight materials with linear, branched or cross-linked molecular struc￾tures mainly consisting of C, H, N and O elements, sometimes along with halogens (Cl,
Br, F) and other elements (Si, P, S, etc.). Nearly all polymers are formulated with suit￾able additives to allow thermal processing, maintain the properties over the use time,
adjust polymer properties for the intended application(s) and, therefore, open new
markets for plastics.
The term “additive” is used here for any ingredient added on purpose to the base
polymer (or the polymer blend), which is, in most cases, the major component of the
plastic formulation. Additives and their effects on polymer properties are as manifold
as the polymers. The main functionalities include maintaining polymer properties, ad￾justing polymer properties for processing through rheological modifications, modify￾ing mechanical properties and extending the properties’ range to fulfill the intended
requirements of an application. The possibility to have tailor-made properties through
additives has played a substantial role in the growth of plastics, and many polymer
applications are possible only in the presence of several ingredients, often in small
quantities, in addition to the polymer itself. As real new polymer structures of stan￾dard plastics or engineering plastics are not introduced anymore, additives drive in￾novation in the plastics area to design properties and functions of polymers, together
with adjusting the polymer microstructures at the manufacturing stage by sophisti￾cated catalysts.
The history of additives starts at the earliest days of plastics when vulcanization
was invented by adding an “additive,” i.e., sulfur, to an unsaturated polyisoprene chain
as present in caoutchouc, achieving cross-linking and thus the elastomeric character of
rubber [1]. A process that is still in use in the industry, however, in combination with
many other additives [2]. Another early success story of additives is celluloid, the first
thermoformable thermoplastic material realized by adding the additive “camphor.”
Camphor as a plasticizer facilitates thermal processing of the intractable cellulose ni￾trate in any required shape [3–5]. Dialkylphthalates were key additives to develop plas￾ticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the 1930s of the last century [6]. Processing of rigid
PVC was made feasible by the development of heat stabilizers such as metal soaps, lead
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110986358-001salts and organotin compounds. In these cases, contrary to plasticizers, small quantities
were sufficient to provide the required processing performance.
Light stabilizers were first used in cellulose nitrate coatings on packaging to protect
packaged oil and food [7]. This was soon followed by the use of phenyl salicylate [8] and
more efficient UV absorbers based on benzophenones [9] or benzotriazoles [10] to
protect plastics from weathering. The growth of polyolefins such as polyethylene or
polypropylene and hydrocarbon elastomers was only possible by the development
of efficient antioxidants based on thermally stable, sterically hindered phenols with
low volatility around 1960 [11], improving earlier developments [12, 13]. Stabilization
efficiency was further enhanced by synergistic blend systems of phenols and phos￾phites and more complex antioxidant mixtures in the 1970s and 1980s of the last
century [14, 15].
Furthermore, efficient light or UV stabilizer formulations were developed parallel
to antioxidant systems to allow outdoor applications of polyolefins [16]. Especially hin￾dered amine light stabilizers (HALS) opened a new area of polymer stabilization [17]
by a radical protection mechanism, which combines light and long-term thermal sta￾bilization. To cope with volatility and migration, HALS polymeric derivatives followed
[18], and based on the HALS protection mechanism, HALS derivatives like alkoxy￾amines were introduced [19, 20].
Fire retardancy of flammable plastics was addressed early in plastic production
by adding halogenated compounds [21]. Fillers, reinforcement agents and pigments
have been used since the earliest times of plastic applications. However, some spe￾cialty additives were commercialized only in the last few decades, e.g., clarifiers, com￾patibilizers or oxygen scavengers. The future may see more plastic additives based on
natural resources and for supporting the circular economy of plastics. It can be ex￾pected that with the growth of additives there will be growth of plastics, as shown,
with antioxidants and light stabilizers [22].

Plastic additives have distinct functions and are composed of many chemical structures
and classes. A potential way to classify the plastic additives is based on the following
functions:

– Long-term thermal stabilizers
– Antiozonants
– Heat stabilizers
– UV/light stabilizers
– Acid scavengers
– Recycling additives

– Antifogging agents
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110986358-002– Gloss improvers

– Aldehyde scavengers
– Foaming agents
– Antifoaming agents
– Repellants
– Markers
– Prodegradants
– Antiodorants/odor improvers
– Electrical conductive additives
– Thermal conductive additives
– Smart additives
In general, maintaining, adjusting and extending the polymer properties can be the
norms. However, in many cases, not only a function but also many targets are ad￾dressed. For example, a sterically hindered phenolic antioxidant will act as a processing
as well as a long-term thermal stabilizer. The individual book chapters follow the pro￾posed classification, wherein the individual additive is associated with the main or
most important effect. The chapters give information regarding the purpose of the addi￾tive, the selection criteria, the properties and the main polymers where the additive is
incorporated, as well as the usual loadings. Furthermore, commercially available repre￾sentative chemical structures, mechanisms, test methods and uses for selected polymers
are given. Current trends and upcoming developments are also explained.
The required quantities of additives to achieve a specific effect vary. For example,
fillers such as mineral fillers, reinforcement agents, plasticizers and flame retardants are
used in high loadings (up to 80 wt% of the polymer), while other additives such as antiox￾idants or nucleating agents show results even at concentrations below 0.1%. In addition,
some additives are incorporated into polymers not to impact the polymer itself but to
protect goods through the addidivated polymer. Examples of such additives are UV ab￾sorbers, oxygen scavengers and other smart additives used to protect packaged food.
There are different types of additive classes (antioxidants, UV/light stabilizers,
flame retardants, lubricants, fibers and fillers) that are used in many polymers, from
thermoplastics to elastomers and thermosets. Other classes are specific only to a sin￾gle polymer (e.g., PVC heat stabilizers) or to a substantial extent to a selected polymer
(e.g., plasticizers in PVC).
2 Overview of additives and the global additives market 5For the selection of suitable additives in the polymer formulation, many criteria
need to be considered in addition to the purpose and the performance, e.g., thermal
stability at the processing temperature, volatility, compatibility with the polymer,
media solubility, product form (liquid, solid, emulsion, suspension, powder, com￾pacted, granulated) and the way of incorporating the additive into the polymer, inter￾actions with the polymer and with other additives (synergistic or antagonistic effects),
and last but not the least cost. The additional formulation cost of adding additives to a
polymer varies and depends primarily on the loading. Natural fillers are often less
expensive than the polymer itself and can reduce the overall cost of the formulation.
Extensive addition of functional additives, e.g., flame retardants, impact modifiers
and specialty additives such as thermally conductive additives may substantially in￾crease the cost of standard polymer formulations or even of engineering plastics. Ad￾ditives in low percentages, such as antioxidants, UV stabilizers, lubricants, processing
aids and many specialty additives, can increase the overall formulation cost by sev￾eral cents per kg. The per kilogram cost of additives starts from well below $1/kg for
fillers to a few $/kg up to $30/kg for many standard additives and can reach up
to $100/kg for some specialty additives.
The global market for plastic additives (without fillers and fibers), as evaluated
by current market studies, was at US$58 billion in 2023 and will reach about US$80
billion in 2030 at an annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 5%, which is above the esti￾mated growth rate of plastics [1, 2, 3].
For the most important additive classes, the market value (Figure 2.1) and corre￾sponding volumes (Figure 2.2) are estimated for 2025, although some uncertainties re￾main. Larger additives in the “others” group are antimicrobials, antistatic agents and
cross-linking agents. Assigning individual number to pure plastic applications is some￾times difficult, as several additive classes, namely UV-stabilizers, pigments and anti￾microbials, are used in other applications, e.g., coatings or textiles, for the same
purpose in equally large quantities. In addition, some important impact modifiers,
such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymers (ABS), are mainly used directly for
plastic applications. Mineral fillers are raw materials in many industries, like paper
manufacturing, and despite their large volumes, plastic applications are of secondary
importance.
From the polymer perspective, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), with a volume of about
12% of all plastics is the main consumer of additives. A large part of plasticizers, heat
stabilizers and impact modifiers, representing together more than one-third of the ad￾ditives’ value, are used there. Polyolefins, i.e., polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene
(PP), as well as polyolefin-based elastomers are the second most important consumers
of additives. Forty percent of the antioxidants and forty-five percent of the light stabil￾izers are used in polypropylene applications [4]. Fillers, fibers and plasticizers domi￾nate the volume market; however, the kilogram value is low. The fastest-growing
market segment of large-value additives is flame retardants, where an annual growth
rate of up to 7% is forecasted [5].
6 2 Overview of additives and the global additives marketUnder “plastic additives initiative,” the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) has com￾piled a list of more than 400 plastic additives registered in REACH (Registration, Eval￾uation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) with production of more than 100
tons annually [6]. Moreover, many applications, such as packaging, require food con￾tact approval, which is based on toxicity data and migration data under defined con￾Billion $

during production, use and end-of-life have to be considered. Thus, the trend toward
more environmental-friendly products or “bio”-products, e.g., additives based on re￾newable resources, is obvious. For example, the so-called GRAS list compiles a list of
additives seen as harmless when used in plastics in contact with food [7].

8 2 Overview of additives and the global additives market3 Additives to maintain properties of polymers
3.1 Antioxidants
Polymers are usually processed in the presence of air, and most plastic applications
are in contact with air. Organic materials, including polymers, are sensitive to oxidation.
Oxidation can occur at any time during the lifetime of the polymer, whether during any
thermal transformation process like compounding, extrusion, granulation or injection
molding, during storage of the polymer or in its final application where it is called “aging”
(together with other aging processes like fatigue). The oxidation process depends on the
oxygen concentration, time and temperature. The polymer structure and other formula￾tion ingredients define the sensitivity to oxidation. Polyolefins, such as polyethylene and
polypropylene, elastomers and all polymers containing double bonds are very sensitive to
oxidation (therefore consuming a large share of antioxidants), whereas engineering plas￾tics like polyamides or polyesters, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyvinylchloride
(PVC) and high-performance plastics are less influenced by oxygen (Figure 3.1).
Excluding air or oxygen in manufacturing processes or the application will, of course,
eliminate this form of degradation. The combined action of light and oxygen results

atmospheric pollutants such as NOx or acids, humidity, extractive media and microbi￾ological attack. Degradation of the polymer and irreversible changes to the polymer
structure are the consequences of any oxidation process, resulting in insufficient me￾chanical properties, cracking, failure of the part, changes in visual appearance (e.g.,
discoloration) and other issues.
The so-called autoxidation of polymers starts with an initiation step forming poly￾mer radicals during thermal processing and shear or through UV-light, e.g., from defect
structures in the polymer chain (Figure 3.2). Ideal polymer structures, for example,
polyethylene, are thermally quite stable; however, defect structures like double bonds
are present in commercial polyethylenes depending on the manufacturing process. Cat￾alyst residues from polymer synthesis, impurities in the polymer and formulation ingre￾dients can also initiate or accelerate the radical formation process. The reaction of the
generated radicals in the presence of molecular oxygen results in peroxy radicals, fol￾lowed by hydroperoxide formation through H abstraction. Hydroperoxides again show
only low thermal stability and decompose into alkoxy and hydroxyl radicals, which are
both highly reactive and abstract hydrogen from the polymer while forming new radi￾cals. If this autoxidation process is not interrupted, there is exponential polymer degra￾dation. Within the oxidative degradation process, the polymer chain is modified by
forming oxygen-containing structures (carbonyl-, alcohol-, carboxyl-groups) and unsatu￾rated groups (vinyl-, vinylidene-, allylic-groups). Disproportionation and depolymeriza￾tion reactions result in low-molecular-weight products. Cross-linked polymer chains are
formed through radical recombination.

10 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymersSuitable stabilizers, so-called antioxidants interrupt the autoxidation cycle by chemi￾cal reactions with the formed intermediates and transform thermally unstable inter￾mediates into thermally more stable reaction products. Thus, they inhibit or reduce
the thermo-oxidative degradation in polymers and maintain the properties during
processing, acting as processing stabilizers, as well as during the product life cycle in
the intended application, acting as long-term thermal stabilizers.
Antioxidants are grouped into primary and secondary antioxidants. Primary anti￾oxidants are radical scavengers, either chain-breaking acceptors or chain-breaking
donors, reacting with radicals by forming thermally stable reaction products. Second￾ary antioxidants are hydroperoxide decomposers, transforming hydroperoxides into
thermally stable products. Primary antioxidants comprise mainly sterically hindered
phenols and (semi-)aromatic amines and to a lesser lactones (benzofuranones) and
hydroxylamines. Secondary antioxidants are mainly phosphites (or phosphonites)
and sulfur-containing species like thioethers or disulfides. Hydroxylamines also act as
secondary antioxidants through the intermediate formation of nitrones. All these anti￾oxidants are consumed while protecting the polymer from oxidation (“sacrificial sta￾bilizers”). Moreover, sterically hindered amines (HALS, see light stabilizers) can act as
alkyl radical scavengers after an oxidation step to the nitroxyl radical.
Although not all pathways of polymer degradation and the corresponding stabiliza￾tion mechanisms are clarified and some aspects are still under discussion [1, 2], the main
reaction pathway of sterically hindered phenols (general structure and typical commercial
representatives, Figure 3.3) is a reaction with O-centered (and less significantly with C￾centered) radicals through H abstraction from the phenol group (H donor), forming a phe￾noxyl radical. This is often followed by a disproportionation reaction to the parent com￾pound and the quinone methide, which is an important active intermediate and reacts
with alkyl, alkoxy and peroxy radicals to form thermally and chemically stable products.
With increasing steric hindrance (e.g., tert-butyl groups vicinal to the phenol group), the
stability of the formed phenoxyl radical is increased; however, with less steric hindrance
(e.g., methyl groups), the efficiency is higher. Furthermore, the quinone methide reaction
products may cause some discoloration [3], which can be reduced, for example, through
the addition of phosphites [4]. There is a strong synergism between phenolic antioxi￾dants and phosphites, as well as between phenolic antioxidants and sulfur-containing
secondary antioxidants. A natural antioxidant is tocopherol (Vitamin E, (1406-18-4)),
which is an excellent processing stabilizer of plastics and is mainly used as a booster in
antioxidant blends or to stabilize polymers in health-sensitive applications [5].
Aromatic amines (Figure 3.4) act as H-donors by forming aminyl radicals, fol￾lowed by coupling reactions or nitroxide or nitrone formation, which can scavenge O￾and C-centered radicals. The final transformation products are often quinone dii￾mines, which are heavily discolored, as are other amine transformation products like
quinone monoimines and N-heterocyclic polynuclear molecules [6]. Therefore, aro￾matic amine stabilizers are mainly used in black applications and preferably in elas￾tomers, as they also act as antiozonants and antifatigue agents.
3.1 Antioxidants 11Lactones or benzofuranones (Figure 3.5) react with O- and C-centered radicals after
transferring the benzylic hydrogen. Hydroxylamines act as H-donors by intermedi￾ary-formed nitrones, primarily as O-centered radical scavengers [7]. Hydroxylamines
or nitrones are often used in color-critical phenol-free applications. Other efficient C￾radical scavengers are acryloyl-modified phenols, whereas an intermolecular complex
is said to be responsible for high-temperature efficiency [8].
The main action of phosphites and phosphonites (Figure 3.6) is the oxidation to
the corresponding phosphates by reacting with hydroperoxides. In contrast to the
complex reaction mechanisms of phenolic and aminic antioxidants, the phosphite hy￾droperoxide reaction is well defined and mainly related to the processing step of plas￾OH

12 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymerstics. Therefore, analysis of the ratio of phosphite to phosphate can be used to analyze
the impact of an individual plastic transformation process. Other phosphorus species
beyond the different phosphite structures and the phosphonite used as stabilizers are
rare. For example, sodium phosphonate is used to prevent discoloration of polyamides,
and 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide is a flame retardant that also
prevents discoloration in polyolefins. Sulfur compounds (Figure 3.7) also act as hydro￾peroxide decomposers by sulfur oxide and sulfenic acid formation. Sulfur compounds
are preferably used in combination with phenolic antioxidants to improve the long￾term thermal stability of polymers at temperature ranges between 100 and 150 °C.
Exceptionally, aliphatic polyamides are stabilized in noncolor-critical applications
with small amounts (20–50 ppm) of copper in the form of halides, e.g., CuBr (7787-70-
4), CuI (7681-65-4) or copper complexes, acting as hydroperoxide decomposers [9].

3.1 Antioxidants 13As primary and secondary antioxidants address different intermediates of the degra￾dation process, synergistic combinations of both product classes are often used, i.e.,
combinations of phenolic antioxidants and phosphites. Moreover, combinations of dif￾ferent antioxidant functions in one molecule are available to benefit from functional
groups very close by. Examples (Figure 3.8) are phenol and sulfur, phenol and phos￾phite, phenol and lactone, lactone and phosphite, phenol and HALS. In general, the
blend combination is often less expensive than the one-molecule approach; further￾more, the blend combination allows different ratios, whereas in the other case, the
ratio is fixed. However, the functional one-molecule approach can benefit from an ad￾ditional synergistic effect through intramolecular interactions, as proven, e.g., for phe￾nolic antioxidants with sulfur-containing side groups [10, 11].

14 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymersCriteria to select suitable stabilizers are the efficiency (maintenance of melt flow, molec￾ular weight, color, mechanical properties), the product form (liquid, solid, compacted,
granulated, masterbatch), volatility, thermal and hydrolytic stability, discoloration in
use and compatibility with the polymer (e.g., avoiding migration and blooming). Other
formulation ingredients need to be considered, as interactions of the stabilizer with the
polymer matrix and with the other ingredients may influence the overall stability in
synergistic or antagonistic effects. Fillers, pigments, carbon black and reinforcement
agents are known to interact considerably with the stabilizers and show a tendency to
reduce stability. Moreover, food contact approval is often decisive, as a large portion of
plastics is used in packaging applications.
Antioxidants are applied in most polymer classes and are essential in the processing
and use of all polyolefins, including polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) types such
as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density
polyethylene (LLDPE), elastomers of any kind as well as styrenics and engineering plas￾tics like polyamides and polyesters. The latter are mainly stabilized for long-term perfor￾mance. Concentrations of antioxidants can be as low as 0.02% for base stabilization after
synthesis but usually range between 0.05% and 0.5%, depending on the short- and long￾term use and the oxidative stability of the polymer to be protected. In elastomers, concen￾trations up to 3% are not unusual. Thermosets are often free from antioxidants as oxida￾tive degradation in cross-linked structures is of less importance.
Standard test methods to evaluate the performance of antioxidants analyze the
thermal stability of polymers and the efficiency of stabilizers and stabilizer systems
by simulating different processing steps by multiple extrusions and long-term aging
by accelerated heat aging. In multiple extrusion experiments, the melt properties are
usually characterized by melt mass flow rate (MFR) or melt volume flow rate (MVR)
according to ISO 1133. The target is that the change in melt flow is minimized by the
applied stabilizers. Melt flow corresponds to the polymer molecular weight (however
influenced by molecular weight distribution) and is related to mechanical properties.
The melt flow change during multiple extrusion depends on the polymer: polypropyl￾ene, some polyethylenes (often Ziegler-Natta type), polyamides, polyesters and poly￾styrene show molecular weight degradation, e.g., melt-flow increase, whereas Phillips
and metallocene type HDPE, LDPE and LLDPE and polymers containing double bonds
like styrene–butadiene–styrene copolymers or elastomers show melt flow decrease,
i.e., molecular weight increase by branching and finally cross-linking. Furthermore,
discoloration is often considered by yellowness index (ISO 17223) measurement. The
development of mechanical properties about the number of extrusions can also be
evaluated, e.g., from pressed or extruded films or injection molding parts. The molec￾ular weight (and molecular weight distribution) can also be determined by more
sophisticated analytical methods, e.g., size exclusion chromatography (SEC), oxidation
of the polymer chain, e.g., through carbonyl index by IR spectroscopy (mainly polyole￾fins), and consumption of stabilizers or residual stabilizers by extraction from the
polymer and chromatographic separation. An example of processing stability and the
3.1 Antioxidants 15synergy between phenolic antioxidants and phosphites is shown for polypropylene
(Figure 3.9): unstabilized polypropylene does not survive a single processing step
without deterioration of the properties. On the other hand, small concentrations of
phosphite or phenolic antioxidant can provide sufficient stability for several transfor￾mation steps, e.g., extrusion and injection molding, depending on the processing con￾ditions (temperature, shear, etc.). The synergy between primary antioxidant (phenol)
and secondary antioxidant (phosphite) is obvious in improved processing stability.
Accelerated heat aging is performed in forced air ovens at elevated temperatures, and
the change of selected properties (in the solid state) similar to multiple extrusion
(changes through the melt status) is recorded over aging time, e.g., visual appearance,
color, mechanical values and molecular weight. In many examples, only the time
until embrittlement, i.e., the time until complete mechanical decay, is taken as a crite￾rion. Many polymers survive without added antioxidants for only a short time at ele￾vated temperatures; however, rather small quantities of added stabilizers can extend
the lifetime considerably (Figure 3.10). The achievable long-term performance de￾pends on the polymer grade, the selection of the type of antioxidant, the dimension of
the test specimens and the testing procedure. Therefore, the shown values can be
taken only as a rough long-term performance indication, although the improvements
by small amounts of antioxidants are impressive.
A simple version of long-term stability for quality control purposes is to deter￾mine the oxidation induction time (OIT, ISO 11357), whereas with DSC or DTA, the in￾duction time for the onset of the oxidation process is measured. The accelerated heat
aging data can be extrapolated by the Arrhenius equation to the use temperature;
however, sample thickness and geometry, environmental conditions and morphologi￾0

Moreover, a nonlinear behavior is often found [12, 13].
Most antioxidants were developed starting in the 1960s up to the 1990s of the last
century. Today, standard antioxidants are available on a global basis from many differ￾ent producers, and the market introduction of antioxidants is focused on combinations
and optimization of standard products for specific applications. Novel antioxidant struc￾tures have been commercialized in very few cases in recent years. Some established
antioxidants have been replaced due to environmental and toxicological concerns, e.g.,
tris(nonylphenyl)phosphite, widely used in polyethylene packaging applications. In
such cases, new liquid phosphites are available as alternatives [14, 15]. Some aromatic
amines may come under scrutiny due to environmental concerns about degradation
products, e.g., from car tire stabilizers [16]. Research trends in antioxidants address re￾duced migration, blooming and extraction through macromolecular structures, grafting
processes or immobilization on fillers and growing use of products from natural resour￾ces. Beyond tocopherols (vitamin E), extracts from plants [17] or antioxidants based on
eugenol, ferulic or sinapic acid [18, 19] have shown adequate performance to petro￾chemical standards. With the progress of the circular economy, specific stabilizers for
recycled plastics will gain growing importance (see Section 3.7).

18 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymers3.2 UV/light stabilizers
Exposure of polymers to sunlight and, to a lesser extent, to artificial light causes the for￾mation of radicals and in combination with ubiquitous oxygen photo-oxidation. Through
reactions by peroxyradicals, hydroperoxides are formed and the autoxidation cycle is ini￾tiated (see Figure 3.2). The structural damage generated by light depends on the polymer
structure (units that can absorb light) and the light energy, which means that primarily
UV light is crucial. Polyolefins such as PP, PE, polymers with double bonds or elastomers
are more sensitive to photooxidation, resulting in fast degradation such as chalking (e.g.,
PP) or crack formation (e.g., PE), discoloration (yellowing, fading) and often a gradual loss
of mechanical properties. On the other hand, polystyrene (general-purpose polystyrene
or GPPS), styrene acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN), antioxidant-stabilized polyamide, polyes￾ter, heat-stabilized PVC and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) are comparatively stable,
and the only negative effect is a certain discoloration (yellowing). Polymers containing
double bonds, e.g., from butadiene or isoprene polymerization, are very sensitive to pho￾tooxidation; therefore, many elastomers are black colored for UV light protection. Logi￾cally, photooxidation starts (contrary to thermal aging) from the surface; therefore, part
design and dimensions (thickness) have a strong influence. Beyond the polymer, light sta￾bility is further affected by other formulation ingredients such as light-absorbing pig￾ments like titanium oxide or carbon black, fillers or photosensitive substances and
environmental conditions, atmospheric pollutants or contact media. Additive strategies
to protect the polymer from the harmful influence of light and to maintain properties
comprise ultraviolet (UV) absorbers, quenchers and specific free radical scavengers,
namely, hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS). UV/light stabilizers are used in the
range of 0.1–1% depending on the formulation, use area (global solar radiation energy)
and requested lifetime.
The protection mechanism of UV absorbers primarily involves the absorption of
UV radiation and its dissipation as heat to prevent the photosensitization of the pro￾tected polymer. The UV absorber of choice should have high absorption coefficients
and inherent light stability to avoid premature degradation. Depending on the struc￾ture, polymers exhibit different absorption maxima in the UV range; therefore, the
UV absorber of choice should correspond to these maxima or cover a broad UV range
as far as possible, whereas combinations of different UV absorbers can act synergisti￾cally [1]. As UV absorber efficiency depends on the part thickness (Lambert–Beer
law), thin sections like films and fibers result only in limited protection or require
high concentrations, which may cause compatibility issues with the polymer. Combin￾ing UV absorbers with other light stabilizers (HALS) that have different protection
mechanisms can be a potential solution.
UV absorbers comprise a number of chemical structures, mainly benzophenones,
benzotriazoles, hydroxyphenyltriazines, cinnamates, diphenylcyanoacrylates, benzox￾azinones and oxanilides (Figure 3.11). Structural variations are related to compatibil￾ity with the substrate to be protected and the molecular weight to reduce volatility
3.2 UV/light stabilizers 19and migration and increase thermal stability as shown for benzotriazoles (Table 3.1),
in addition to spectral UV coverage. However, carbon black and many colored sub￾stances act as UV absorbers.
Hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) or hindered amine stabilizers (HAS) pro￾vide, in addition to light stability, long-term thermal stability. They hardly absorb UV
light but mainly act as radical scavengers. Their chemical structures are based on ste￾rically hindered piperidines and their derivatives. A second class based on sterically
hindered piperazinones is no longer available on the market [2]. As HALS have been
proven to be very efficient light stabilizers and long-term heat stabilizers, many struc￾tures have been made available at the commercial stage, comprising low- and high￾molecular oligomeric and polymeric compounds (Figure 3.12). Low-molecular-weight
HALS are more efficient; however, property loss through migration and volatility can
be an issue. The polymeric HALS are mainly oligomers with molecular weights below
10,000 g/mol to provide sufficient mobility in the polymer matrix. Secondary amines
(–NH) are the most common structures. Tertiary amines (N-alkyl, mainly methyl), hy￾droxylamines (N–OH) and alkoxyamines (N-O-alkyl, Figure 3.13) are derivatives of the
basic structure following the protection mechanism of HALS. In a simplified form, the
cyclic mechanism of stabilization through HALS starts with the oxidation to the ni￾troxyl radical, scavenging of an alkyl radical, reaction of the resulting alkoxyamine
with a peroxyradical and reformation of the nitroxyl radical (the so-called Denisov
cycle (Figure 3.14) [3, 4]). Other potential contributions to the stabilization mechanism
may include transition metal complexation (thus eliminating the catalytic activity in
the oxidation of transition metals), quenching of excited oxygen polymer charge
transfer complexes and, to a lesser extent, hydroperoxide decomposition. As with

3.2 UV/light stabilizers 23Combinations of HALS and phenols can result in an antagonistic effect because of the
interaction of the phenol H-donor with the nitroxide radical. Therefore, low concen￾trations of phenols are preferred in this case. Sulfur stabilizers are known for antago￾nisms due to salt formation with the basic piperidine structure, similar to reaction
products of pesticides and halogenated flame retardants. Combinations of HALS struc￾tures and other stabilizer moieties in one molecule are known as well, e.g., HALS￾phenol. HALS phosphite combinations seem especially efficient but are not commer￾cially available currently [7, 8].
The third group of potential light stabilizers are quenchers. Quenchers absorb the
energy taken in by the photosensitive groups of the polymer or from singlet oxygen
and dissipate it by heat, fluorescence or phosphorescence, thus protecting the poly￾mer from degradation. The activity of quenchers is independent of the thickness of
the article. Therefore, quenchers were used in the past in agricultural films. However,
because the molecules contain nickel as a toxic metal (Figure 3.15), they were phased
out in many countries for environmental reasons.
Many standard UV absorbers and HALS stabilizers are available globally from differ￾ent companies. Because of the required inherent photostability of the UV absorbers,
some structures are under discussion due to their persistence in the environment and
the risk of bioaccumulation [9]. Innovation of light stabilizers is mainly focused on
additive blends for the optimized requirements of specific applications, e.g., roofing,

24 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymersphotovoltaics, greenhouse or agricultural films. Within the field of HALS, there is on￾going research mainly in the area of structural variations of alkoxyamines [10–14].
Photooxidation is tested by UV exposure, by either artificial or natural weather￾ing. Natural or outdoor weathering is carried out in high-radiation areas to get an ac￾celerated effect (e.g., Florida, humid, or Arizona, dry). There is a seasonal influence,
and humidity plays a role. Artificial weathering is carried out in suitable devices,
where a light source close to the sunlight spectrum or lamps with high UV intensity
are used (e.g., according to ISO 4582). An acceleration factor of 4–10 can be achieved
compared to natural weathering. In addition to light energy, temperature and dry/wet
conditions through water spraying can be varied. Independent of natural or artificial
conditions, change in the plastic’s properties, such as visual appearance (e.g., chalk￾ing, crazes, loss of gloss) and mechanical properties (e.g., tensile strength, elongation,
impact strength) is recorded about the exposure time or radiation energy.
UV light-stabilized samples consistently show improvements in maintaining plastic
properties compared to unstabilized ones. The effect depends on the polymer structure
and all formulation ingredients; some indications are given in Figures 3.16 and 3.17 to
show the stabilizer effect in artificial weathering experiments. However, the given val￾ues can only be taken as rough estimations as many factors such as the polymer grade,
the stabilizer structure, other additives, the size of the plastic part, the testing condi￾tions and the failure criteria influence the results. Regardless of any influence, there is
usually a definite relationship between the stabilizer concentration and the extended
lifetime. The combination of different light stabilizers often results in a synergistic im￾provement [15], as shown for different polymeric HALS (Figure 3.18).

3.3 Heat stabilizers
The expression “heat stabilizers” or “thermal stabilizers” is used in the context of the
stabilizing halogenated polymers, mainly PVC, polyvinylidenechloride (PVDC) or chlo￾rinated PE, where the primary degradation pathway occurs via dehydrochlorination,
i.e., the elimination of HCl during thermal processing steps. Another application area
is the stabilization of brominated flame retardants against premature decomposition
during processing steps. Most product developments and scientific investigations
about the mechanisms of heat stabilizers have been conducted for PVC, as it repre￾sents the largest market.
The dehydrochlorination reaction starts from polymer chain defect structures, e.g.,
tertiary chlorine, vicinal chlorine, unsaturated end groups or β-chloroallyl groups.
Some oxidized structures, such as oxovinylene groups, may play a role as well [1]. The
elimination of HCl and autocatalytic acceleration of the elimination process result in
3.3 Heat stabilizers 27polyene sequences and the formation of carbenium salts. Both structures are responsi￾ble for strong discoloration, from yellow to finally black.
Stabilization strategies for PVC include additives that can absorb, react with or
neutralize HCl, stabilize defect structures of the polymer chain, react with polyene se￾quences and decompose carbenium salts to maintain the initial color and prevent dis￾coloration. The chemical classes in use are organic or inorganic lead compounds,
synergistic mixed metal soaps based on zinc, calcium, barium, cadmium, organo-tin
compounds and more recently metal-free organic-based systems. In addition, numer￾ous costabilizers are combined with the primary heat stabilizers, e.g., organic phos￾phites, polyols, epoxides, β-diketones, zeolites and hydrotalcites either to improve the
initial color or to extend stability. Therefore, commercial products are often complex
packages of heat stabilizers and costabilizers. PVC heat stabilizers are used in concen￾trations below 1% (tin) up to 5% (mixed metal), depending on the formulation, lubri￾cants, plasticizers, costabilizers, processing method and final application.
Although lead compounds are phased out in many countries such as in the EU
and replaced with mixed metal salts mainly based on calcium/zinc, lead salts such as
tribasic lead sulfate, dibasic lead phosphite and dibasic lead stearate are still in use to
a large extent despite severe environmental and toxicity risks [2]. These stabilizers
provide good efficiency and lubrication at low cost. Mechanistically, lead carboxylates
trap chlorine radicals, forming lead chlorides that do not trigger further PVC decom￾position. The carboxylate radical reacts with the remaining macroradical after chlo￾rine elimination, interrupting the degradation reaction [3].
Mixed metal salts are the stabilizers of choice today for nontransparent PVC appli￾cations such as pipes, window profiles, cables manufactured by extrusion, with a trend
toward calcium/zinc-based combinations, e.g., calcium stearate (1592-23-0) and zinc stea￾rate (557-05-1) as the simplest example. Zinc carboxylates are capable of substituting la￾bile chlorine atoms by forming ZnCl2 and providing a particularly good initial PVC
color. However, the formed ZnCl2 catalyzes the dehydrochlorination reaction, known as
“zinc burning.” Through the reaction with calcium carboxylates, zinc carboxylates are
reformed. The resulting CaCl2 is inert. Therefore, the synergistic combination of calcium
and zinc compounds provides particularly good initial color (from Zn) and extended
thermal stability (from Ca, Figure 3.19). Contrary to tin and lead systems, mixed metal
stabilizers based on Ca/Zn are usually complex mixtures of compounds contributing to
heat stability and optimized lubrication to provide smooth processing. The addition of
costabilizers, e.g., in the form of metal acetylacetonates and hydrotalcites, leads to ex￾ceptionally low initial color and delayed degradation [4]. Apart from Ca/Zn-mixed metal
salts, Mg/Zn salts and liquid barium/zinc stabilizers are in use, the latter mainly for plas￾tisol processing in flooring or wallpaper manufacturing. Some zinc or zinc/potassium
laurates or octoates are applied in foaming processes where they function as activators
(the so-called kicker) for blowing agents.
28 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymersTin stabilizers are still the additives of choice for highly transparent PVC applications,
especially for calandering, due to their low contribution to lubrication and their stabi￾lization power under demanding processing conditions like injection molding of PVC
(Figure 3.20). Organo tin mercaptides, e.g., dioctyltin-dithioglycolate (15571-58-1, 27107-
89-7, 15535-79-2) or organo tin carboxylates, e.g., dioctyltin maleate (16091-18-2), are
mainly used for outdoor applications due to their high light stability. These com￾pounds react with HCl to form alkyl-substituted tin chlorides. Furthermore, there is a
direct reaction with labile chlorine atoms by a substitution reaction with the mer￾capto group, resulting in tin chloride formation. Moreover, mercaptides can add to
polyene sequences and thus interrupt the conjugation. Maleic acid derivatives may

3.3 Heat stabilizers 29act similarly through a Diels–Alder mechanism. However, tin compounds can be seen
as an environmental risk [5]. Therefore, certain structures, such as those based on
butyl compounds, have been phased out in Europe.
Metal-free heat stabilizers have been an area of research parallel to the develop￾ment of metal-based products. Although the consumption of metal-free PVC heat stabil￾izers is still at a low level, environmental concerns regarding traditional lead and tin
stabilizers may lead to an increase in their use in the future, e.g., in water pipe applica￾tions [6, 7]. Key structures of metal-free stabilizer systems are nitrogen-containing mole￾cules such as β-aminocrotonates, dihydropyrimidines (uracils) [8], trialkanolamines
and their reaction products and salts, e.g., the perchlorate salt (3648-18-8 [9]) and others
(Figure 3.21), where HCl scavenging capacity seems to be of high importance. Uracil de￾rivatives, e.g., 1,3-dimethyl-6-amino-uracil [6642-31-5], are today the established stabi￾lizer components and the preferred research areas to identify improved versions, e.g.,
combinations with metal complexes [10] or using bis-uracils or uracil oligomers [11, 12].
Because of good compatibility with other stabilizers, organic-based stabilizers are suit￾able for PVC recycling, in case restabilization is needed [13].
The most important costabilizers in PVC formulations, mainly in combination with
mixed metal salts, are alkyl-aryl-phosphites, which improve early color. Polyols like
pentaerythritol or dipentaerythritol and β-diketones function as complexing agents
and deactivate the negative effects of formed zinc chloride. Epoxy compounds, such
as epoxidized fatty esters like epoxidized soybean oil (8013-07-8) or epoxidized linseed
oil (8016-11-3), react directly with HCl or substitute labile chlorine atoms, e.g., in the
presence of zinc ions. Furthermore, the epoxidized fatty esters function as plasticizers.
Hydrotalcites and zeolites scavenge HCl and considerably extend thermal stability [14].
Acetylacetonates increase initial color stability by metal complexation.

30 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymersApart from the shift to calcium–zinc-based formulations and the development of
metal-free stabilizers, intensive development and market introduction of new heat sta￾bilizer molecules for the mature PVC business cannot be expected. The developmental
focus of stabilizer suppliers is the improvement of application-specific formulations.
PVC stabilizers are selected according to processing (e.g., calandering, extrusion),
product form (e.g., liquid for plasticized PVC), compatibility with formulations con￾taining, e.g., lubricants, stability about blooming (e.g., plate-out), initial color and
color stability.
The properties and stability of PVC formulations are assessed through fusion
characteristics by rheometer measurements to obtain information about PVC pro￾cessability. Heat stability is evaluated according to ISO 305 by static heat tests, where
test specimens are aged at a constant temperature and primarily color changes (e.g.,
yellowness index) are recorded. Alternatively, to assess the performance of heat sta￾bilizers, the time until the dehydrochlorination reaction occurs can be measured, e.g.,
through pH change (ISO 182) or more simply through the so-called Congo red test.
Combined thermal and shear stress are analyzed by dynamic tests such as two-roll
mill processing or multiple extrusion. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for heat sta￾bility, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to analyze glass transition and fusion,
transmission, heat distortion temperature and mechanical properties may be addi￾tional evaluation criteria.
PVDC and its copolymers are thermally less stable than PVC; therefore, these prod￾ucts are mainly processed from aqueous dispersions as barrier coatings. For thermal
processing and stabilization, PVDC formulations comprise plasticizers, epoxidized soy￾bean oil (8013-07-8) and tetrasodium pyrophosphate (7722-88-5) [15]. However, tin stabil￾izers, hydrotalcites, metal soaps and metal oxides also contribute to stabilization [16].
Because of its lower chlorine content, chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) is thermally
more stable than PVC, and the degradation process is slower compared to PVC. It
seems that calcium–zinc metal soaps are not efficient and can even accelerate the
degradation process [17]. As potential heat stabilizers, magnesium oxide (1309-48-4) or
magnesium hydroxide (1309-42-8) are mentioned, combined with antioxidants [18].

3.4 Metal deactivators
Transition metals from catalyst residues, impurities (e.g., from carbon black), metal￾containing pigments or contact with metals can catalyze the accelerated oxidative
degradation of polymers. Potential mechanisms of this catalytic activity include accel￾erated decomposition of hydroperoxides, activation of oxygen, direct radical reaction
with the polymer or a photosensitizing effect [1]. Transition metals with a pronounced
catalytic effect are Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Fe. A higher oxidation state of ions seems more
32 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymerscritical, as shown for Co(III) [1]. Wire and cable are the most important applications to
protect the substrate from premature degradation through contact with metals by
adding the so-called metal deactivators. These additives are chelating agents that
form stable complexes with transition metals, thereby eliminating the influence of
ions catalyzing oxidation reactions (Figure 3.22).
Chemical structures of metal deactivators are mainly hydrazides or triazine deriva￾tives, whereas the multifunctional combination of a hydrazide group and sterically
hindered phenol groups (32687-78-8) is one of the standard metal deactivators. In ad￾dition, phenolic structures with sulfur groups (36339-47-6) are claimed to function as
metal deactivators. More recently, it was shown that selected alditols in combination
with simple phenolic antioxidants can fulfill a similar role [2]. Furthermore, the bene￾fits of metal deactivators were reported in recycled plastics for cable-containing
blends [3] and ABS postconsumer recyclates from automotive applications [4].

3.5 Acid scavengers
Acid scavengers or antiacids are often used in base stabilization packages of polyole￾fins to neutralize acidic by-products from polymerization catalyst residues, namely,
HCl. These by-products may cause corrosion on processing equipment and reduce the
overall thermal stability of the polymer. Furthermore, acid scavengers can help to
prevent acid-catalyzed reactions, such as the hydrolytic cleavage of polycondensation
polymers, e.g., polyesters and polyamides. The influence of acidic additives or acidic
degradation products from, e.g., flame retardants, may be reduced.
In principle, any additive to neutralize acids or to function as an acceptor for H +
may be useful. In reality, representative acid scavengers for polyolefins are acid salts
from long-chain aliphatic acids such as calcium stearate (1592-23-0) or zinc stearate
(557-05-1), metal oxides, e.g., zinc oxide (1314-13-2) and calcium oxide (1305-78-8). Hy￾drotalcites, e.g., synthetic magnesium aluminum hydrotalcites (11097-59-9), are often
preferred for color-critical formulations. More sophisticated structures are lactic acid
derivatives like the calcium salt of stearoyl lactylate (5793-94-2) [1, 2]. The acid scaven￾ger of choice depends on the quantity of catalytic residues, i.e., the polymerization
process, acceptance of discoloration and requested processing stability. Concentra￾tions of antiacids mostly range between 0.05% and 1%, with the lower end of 0.05–
0.2% for polyolefins.

3.6 Antiozonants
Antiozonants are a special class of antioxidants that are of primary importance for
elastomers. The polymer chains of aliphatic elastomers, synthesized from butadiene,
isoprene and other dienes, contain even after cross-linking a substantial concentra￾tion of unreacted double bonds. These double bonds are not only essential for the
34 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymerselastomeric properties but also represent the weak part of the polymer about oxida￾tion. In addition to weakening the C–H bond in the alpha position, the double bond
itself is prone to react with atmospheric ozone, forming an unstable ozonide through
a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition in the first step, followed by rearrangement and degrada￾tion reactions [1]. The ozone reaction takes place at the surface of the elastomer arti￾cle and leads to small, deep cracks (“ozone cracking”) [2]. Therefore, for all long-term
elastomeric applications, such as tires, antiozonants are essential components.
As efficient antiozonants (and antioxidants), N,N′-substituted p-phenylenediamine
(PPDs) derivatives are the products of choice, such as 6PPD (Figure 3.23). The reaction
of the p-phenylenediamines with ozone is faster than the reaction with the double
bonds. The PPDs are oxidized by ozone to a radical cation, forming an O3
− radical. The
cation is then further oxidized to the nitroxyl radical, leading to the formation of a
hydroperoxide radical [3]. As the reaction takes place at the surface of the elastomer
article, the PPDs must migrate to the surface for protection. However, PPDs tend to
cause discoloration and staining, restricting their use to black formulations. The con￾centrations of antiozonants can range up to several percent.
An alternative antiozonant method is the incorporation of microcrystalline paraffin
wax, which migrates to the surface and forms a barrier layer. However, it is less effi￾cient and is usually applied with PPDs.
Accelerated testing of antiozonants is performed in the laboratory by storing test
bars at elevated ozone concentrations and slightly increased temperatures. The deter￾mination of mechanical properties and the analysis of crack formation and surface
changes, e.g., through spectroscopy are then conducted.
PPDs and their degradation products are now considered as environmental
risk [4–6], with PPD degradation products, such as 6-PPD-quinone, appearing to be
more critical than PPDs themselves. Replacing them with other antioxidant classes will
be difficult due to the mechanism that requires a fast reaction with ozone. Unfortu￾nately, ozone concentration is increasing globally; therefore, the need for antiozonants
will persist. One potential approach to address the disadvantages of typical PPDs, such
as migration, extractability and staining, is to combine the active amine molecule with
a grafting function. During vulcanization, the molecule is chemically bonded to the elas￾tomer network [7].

3.7 Recycling additives
Recycled plastics differ from virgin polymers due to changes at the molecular level
caused by autoxidation and aging processes. These changes depend on the use time,
environment, previous stabilization, formulation with additives, purification and sep￾aration processes. Even well-separated single plastic streams are mixtures of different
manufacturers, synthetic processes and formulations. Moreover, the presence of im￾purities from other polymers, residues from printing inks, labels, adhesives, contact
media (e.g., food and food ingredients) and their degradation products is often an
issue [1]. Metal impurities from transition metals, such as iron and copper, may func￾tion as oxidation catalysts and accelerate oxidative processes. Essential additives to
improve the quality of recycled plastics include stabilizers and antioxidants (see Sec￾tion 3.1), repair additives in the form of chain extenders (see Section 5.3), compatibil￾izers (see Section 4.6) and antiodorants or odor-neutralizing agents (see Chapter 8).
Predamage of recycled plastics through oxidation from the first service life results
in increased carbonyl, acidic group and hydroperoxide content compared to virgin
material, in addition to molecular weight changes. The quantity of oxidized structures
can be orders of magnitude higher when compared to virgin polymers (Table 3.2).
These oxidized molecular structures act as initiator sites and prodegradants accelerat￾ing further degradation, as shown for polyolefins [2–5]. Heavily degraded recyclate
may even affect in blends virgin polymers, leading to accelerated degradation [6]. Re￾cyclate stabilizers fulfill the same function as in virgin material, namely to protect the
polymer from oxidative degradation during processing and to maintain the properties
36 3 Additives to maintain properties of polymersduring use. In general, a well-stabilized virgin material is a good prerequisite for suc￾cessful high-quality recycling as the degradation might be only at a low level. Never￾theless, consumed stabilizers from the first application must be replaced or adjusted
to the requirements of the second application. For example, recyclate from a short￾term packaging application is not sufficiently stabilized for a long-term service life in
a subsequent application.
Adjusted recyclate stabilizers combine phenolic antioxidants, phosphites/phosphonites
and antiacids in optimized ratios. The best cost/performance stabilizer combination for
recyclates is often different from that for virgin material. The classical stabilizer sys￾tems, consisting of phenolic antioxidants and phosphites, mainly interrupt the autoxida￾tion cycle of polymers. Selected antiacids, e.g., metal oxides such as CaO (1305-78-8), ZnO
(1314-13-2), MgO (1309-48-4), metal soaps, epoxides or hydrotalcites, neutralize the in￾creased number of acidic groups and reduce their negative influence on the aging of
recyclates. Benefits of restabilization include smooth, consistent processing with fewer
process interruptions, fewer material defects, fewer discoloration, improved mechani￾cal properties, the possibility to use higher concentrations of recycled plastics in virgin
blends and extended long-term stability [7–9]. Adding stabilizers at each recycling step
is preferred over high additive concentrations at the first step, as the latter may result
in discoloration, incompatibility and blooming. Increased multiple recycling may cause
similar compatibility challenges through increased loading of additives. For example,
restabilization maintains the melt flow of recycled PE film blends at a higher level,

A more recent restabilization system uses selected alditols as costabilizers together
with phenolic antioxidants. Alditols (and other functional chemical compounds like
cyclitols, amines, hydroxylamines and others) can interact directly with carbonyl
groups and thus provide improved recyclate protection [10, 11]. As a recyclate stabi￾lizer system component, these additives may further fulfill the function of hydroper￾oxide decomposers and metal deactivators, resulting in improved efficiency, excellent
processing and long-term thermal stability of recycled plastics. Because of the com￾paratively low concentrations needed, these systems are the materials of choice for
multiple recycling steps. As alditols are based on natural resources, fully bio-based
stabilizer systems are accessible [1].
All other additives can be used in applications of recycled plastics similar to vir￾gin polymers, e.g., light/UV stabilizers for outdoor applications. As mechanical recy￾cling of plastics is predicted to grow substantially within the next years, it is expected
that the portfolio of specific recyclate stabilizer systems will increase equally.

4.1 Fillers
Fillers added to a polymer fundamentally change the properties of the formulation.
As with other reinforcement agents (fibers), the stiffness, tensile strength and E￾modulus are significantly increased, while toughness, elongation at break and impact
resistance are reduced. Fillers increase the thermal stability (heat distortion tempera￾ture) and reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion. In the thermal transformation
process of shaping plastic parts, fillers increase the melt viscosity, but shrinkage as a
consequence of the crystallization process is decreased compared to an unfilled part.
Moreover, fillers can function as nucleating agents in semicrystalline polymers (poly￾esters, polyamides). The hardness of fillers can lead to increased corrosion and abra￾sion of the processing equipment. The filler type (chemical composition, polarity,
shape, surface), size (micro or nano, particle size distribution), compatibility with the
polymer matrix (polarity, functional groups, dispersion) and loading will influence
the final properties of the composite. The density of the final part is usually increased
compared to an unfilled one. Water uptake of the formulation can be higher depend￾ing on the hydrophilicity of the filler. Creep of the final part is reduced. To cope with
incompatibilities, often other additives, e.g., coupling agents, dispersants, lubricants
and filler deactivators are recommended. Another simple reason to add fillers is the
cost reduction of a formulation, as natural mineral fillers are always of lower cost
than the polymer itself. However, the quality of mineral fillers and their impurities
(e.g., transition metals) often require strategies to compensate for inferior long-term
properties.
Fillers can be of inorganic or organic, natural or synthetic origin, with natural min￾erals as the dominant share [1]. Chemical composition, shape and specific properties
vary broadly (Table 4.1); many naturally available minerals have been tested in poly￾mers. The most widely used is calcium carbonate (chalk, marble (471-34-1)), which, to￾gether with silicon dioxide (silica, quartz (14808-60-7, 7631-86-9)) or aluminum silicate
(kaolin (1332-58-7)), is an example of round-shaped materials. Talc (magnesium silicate
(14807-96-6)), graphite (7782-42-5) or glimmer (potassium aluminum silicates (12001-26-2))
are examples of platy structures. Examples of fibrous structures are wollastonite (cal￾cium silicate (13983-17-0)) or whiskers (silicon dioxide (409-21-2), boron carbide (12069-
32-8)). In addition to natural origins, some fillers are manufactured synthetically to
guarantee high purity or specific sizes and surfaces (e.g., precipitated calcium carbon￾ate). Platy and fibrous minerals may result in anisotropic properties through induced
orientation in the production process.
Glass hollow spheres and other hollow spheres are used to reduce the specific
density of a formulation and to allow lightweight constructions [2]. Inorganic fillers
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110986358-004are often surface modified, e.g., through long-chain fatty acids (e.g., stearic acid or
stearates) to improve dispersion, processing and compatibility with the polymer ma￾trix. Nanocomposites based on organically modified montmorillonite (nanoclays, so￾dium aluminum silicate (1318-93-0)) as a representative can combine low loading with
a disproportionate enhancement of mechanical properties. In this case, the organic
modification, e.g., by long-chain ammonium molecules, is essential to allow exfolia￾tion of the platy structures, i.e., to achieve single (or stacks of a few) platelets [3–5]. In
recent years, many other mineral compositions in nanodimensions, have been evalu￾ated as a potential strategy to adjust polymer properties, e.g., graphene (7782-42-5) or
carbon nanotubes (308068-56-6), but also oxides and layered double hydroxides to im￾prove mechanical properties and/or flame retardancy [6].
Organic filler materials are as numerous as inorganic minerals and range from
wood flour, cork flour, milled cellulose and fibers from cotton, flax or hemp to starch [7],
while contributing to a green image [8]. Recently, sugar-type synthetic polymers manu￾Table 4.1: Examples of mineral fillers used in plastic applications.

4.1 Fillers 41factured through enzymatic polymerization were proposed as novel biodegradable filler
materials [9].
Fillers are applied in all standard polymers such as PE, PP, PS, PVC and also in
engineering plastics, such as PBT, PA or acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer
(ABS). Typical filler loadings are 10–40 wt% but may exceptionally go up to 80 wt%.
Filler deactivators, e.g., siloxane or epoxide oligomers and polymers, are added to
the formulation to chemically block the surface to reduce the adsorption capability of
the filler, e.g., toward stabilizers (antioxidants, light stabilizers) and in general to
avoid efficiency reduction of additives in the formulation.

4.2 Fibers
The addition of fibers, whether inorganic ones such as glass, organic polymeric or nat￾ural fibers, will fundamentally change the mechanical properties of polymers similar
to fillers [1, 2]. The resulting reinforced plastic composites show high stiffness, tensile
strength and E-modulus, whereas elongation at break is reduced to the elongation at
break of the fiber. Impact resistance is usually lower compared to the unreinforced
polymer. Thermal stability (heat distortion temperature) is enhanced, and the coeffi￾cient of thermal expansion is reduced. During processing, melt viscosity is increased
compared to the polymer itself. Contrary to most fillers, fibers exhibit a distinctive
aspect ratio (fiber length to fiber diameter), resulting in fiber orientation in the
42 4 Additives to adjust mechanical properties of polymersmanufacturing process and anisotropy of the mechanical properties of the shaped
part. The surface quality of the parts is often negatively influenced by the reinforce￾ment. The abrasiveness of fibers may cause wear and tear to the machinery.
Among the many different fibers, glass fibers are by far in the largest volume [3, 4].
Mainly, E- (electrical grade) glass in the form of chopped short fibers in various dimen￾sions is used, with standard grades being about 4.5 mm in length and 10–15 µm in diam￾eter. In addition, long glass fiber reinforcement, e.g., manufactured through pultrusion,
shows additional market growth [5]. In such cases, the fiber length in the final part is
about 10 mm. Glass fiber mats and nonwovens are used for manufacturing light-weight
composite structures with, e.g., unsaturated polyesters or epoxides as a thermoset poly￾mer matrix, or with thermoplastic polymers. The main market for short glass fibers is
engineering plastics, namely polyamides (PA), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polycar￾bonate (PC) or polyacetals (POM), with automotive, building and construction, electrical
and electronics, aerospace, wind energy as the main branches.
Besides glass basalt fibers [6], boron (12069-32-8) and silicon carbide (409-21-2) fi￾bers are other examples of inorganic fibers used in specific plastic applications to
combine high stiffness and high strength in composites.
Carbon fibers represent a high-performance area of reinforcement where ex￾treme E-modulus and tensile strength values for composites can be achieved, replac￾ing traditional metal applications [7, 8]. High wear resistance, low coefficient of
friction and high thermal and electrical conductivity are other advantages. Carbon fi￾bers are manufactured mainly from polyacrylonitrile by several thermal treatment
steps; further treatment of the fibers to increase compatibility with the polymer ma￾trix is mandatory [9].
Metal fibers made from stainless steel, copper, aluminum and other materials in￾crease electrical conductivity and provide electromagnetic interference (EMI) shield￾ing and antistatic properties [10].
In addition, synthetic polymer fibers are used as reinforcement agents, ranging
from polypropylene and polyester fibers to polyaramides. In a specific embodiment,
the matrix and the reinforcement fiber are from the same polymer (so-called self￾reinforced polymer composites) [11–13]. Although these composites maximize compat￾ibility between the matrix and fibers and facilitate mechanical recycling, production
processes are more challenging. Examples include PP homopolymer fibers in a poly￾olefin matrix or polylactic acid (PLA) stereo complex fibers in a PLA matrix.
In recent years, natural plant fiber composites have been developed to replace
traditional glass fiber applications. These composites are based on cotton, jute, hemp,
flax, kenaf, sisal, coir and other fibers [14–16]. Natural plant fibers have a lower
weight (specific density) than glass fibers and can contribute to sound and vibration
damping [17]. Another main reason to use natural fibers is the reduction of the carbon
footprint of plastic applications [18]. The composites of polymers from renewable re￾sources as matrix reinforced with natural fibers would be particularly attractive.
4.2 Fibers 43However, processing of natural fibers is more challenging compared to glass fibers.
Despite the economic and ecological advantages of natural fibers, their hydrophobic
behavior presents a deficit, making pretreatment or the use of additives like coupling
agents mandatory.
Fibers are applied in concentrations of 10–50 wt%, whereas most formulations
contain between 20% and 30% glass fibers.
In many cases, additional reactive additives have to be applied in fiber compo￾sites to improve the compatibility and adhesion between the fiber and polymer ma￾trix. Glass fibers are usually surface modified by sizing agents, such as epoxy silanes
or amino silanes, which have an affinity/reactivity both toward glass and the matrix
resin. Polymeric coupling agents such as PP-graft-maleic anhydride increase adhesion
between a nonpolar matrix and polar natural fibers.

4.3 Nucleating agents
Nucleating agents enhance the number of crystallization nuclei in polymers during
the thermal manufacturing process of plastic parts and can provide three potential
effects: acceleration of the crystallization rate, increased transparency of plastic parts
and modification of the crystal structure.
Acceleration of the crystallization rate is important for semicrystalline polymers,
where crystallization occurs slowly during usual manufacturing processes like injec￾tion molding or where the polymer melt tends to undercool, e.g., with PP, PET, PLA,
PA-6 or PA-6.6. By adding nucleating agents, crystallization starts at higher tempera￾tures and is accelerated, which offers cycle time reduction in manufacturing pro￾cesses. As a consequence of the formed crystals, the morphology (spherulite sizes),
mechanical and optical properties of the plastic parts are influenced. Standard nucleat￾ing agents often consist of alkali metal salts, mainly sodium [1], e.g., sodium benzoate
(532-32-1), sodium bicyclo[2.2.1] heptane dicarboxylate (351870-33-2) or phosphates, e.g.,
sodium 2,2′-methylene-bis-(4,6-di-tert-butyl-phenyl)phosphate (106396-29-6) (Figure 4.1).
However, many substances not soluble in the polymer melt may act as heterogeneous
crystallization nuclei, such as ionomers, talc (14807-96-6), nanoclays, other fillers or car￾bon black. For example, the addition of 0.7% sodium benzoate to PET increases the crys￾tallization temperature from 202–205 °C (not nucleated PET) to 226.2 °C [2]. The main
active nucleating agents are, after chain scission (and therefore molecular weight de￾crease), the ionic sodium carboxylic acid end groups of PET [3].
Fast-crystallizing polymers, such as PE or PBT, are generally less impacted by nu￾cleating agents. However, HDPE is an area of research aimed at improving cycle time,
e.g., of blow-molding applications or enhancing clarity. In this context, calcium hexa￾hydrophthalate (491589-22-1) is reported to be an efficient nucleating agent [4].
A specific class of nucleating agents, which induces low haze, clarity and high
transparency, is called “clarifiers” and is mainly used in PP for transparent applica￾tions. Clarifiers are soluble in the polymer at the processing temperature and crystallize
4.3 Nucleating agents 45from the polymer melt just before the polymer crystallizes, thus providing a high
nucleation density. Clarifiers for PP are usually based on dibenzylidene sorbitols
and their derivatives, e.g., bis(3,4-dimethyl-dibenzylidene) sorbitol (DMDBS, 135861-
56-2) or more recently on 1,2,3,-tridesoxy-4,6,5,7-bis-O-[(4-propylphenyl)methylene]noni￾tol (882073-43-0) [5, 6]. Nonsorbitol structures are, for example, composed of 1,3,5-
benzenetrisamides [7]. The loadings of trisamide structures can be below 0.05%, whereas
the typical sorbitol concentration is 0.2%.
Further specific nucleating agents are capable of generating specific morphologies
of the polymer, for example, polypropylene in the β-modification. Isotactic polypropyl￾ene crystallizes (with and without standard nucleating agents) in the thermodynami￾cally stable α-form. The metastable β-modification of polypropylene shows increased
impact strength and is used for the production of pipes. To obtain β-nucleated polypro￾pylene during manufacturing, the addition of selected β-nucleating agents is necessary.
The possibility of generating β-nucleated polypropylene was first realized by the addi￾tion of the pigment quinacridone (1047-16-1). Today, mainly (semi-)aromatic amides are
used, e.g., N,N′-dicyclohexyl-2–6-naphthalenedicarboxamide (153250-52-3) [8, 9].
In some other cases, the crystallization rate of polymers should be delayed or the
degree of crystallization should be reduced. This can be achieved by antinucleation
agents. For example, the addition of 1% styrene–acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN) or poly￾styrene to PET reduces haze during blow molding processes [10, 11]. In polyamides,
nigrosine (8005-03-6) is used as an antinucleation agent to enhance the surface quality

enhanced by blends with metal salts or ionic liquids [14, 15]. As nigrosine is a black
pigment, selected phosphonites are a colorless alternative to delay the crystallization
of polyamides [16].

References 474.4 Plasticizers
Plasticizers in the form of additives (so-called external plasticizers) modify polymer
properties in many aspects. At the processing stage, they function as processing aids,
reducing the melting and processing temperature of the polymer. In the solid phase, a
soft and flexible material is obtained with reduced elastic modulus, reduced tensile
strength and increased elongation and toughness. Glass transition temperature, heat
distortion temperature and hardness are lowered compared to the unplasticized par￾ent polymer. These kinds of plasticizers are also called “primary plasticizers.” Second￾ary plasticizers do not change the properties of the polymer when added alone;
however, when added in conjunction with the primary plasticizer, they enhance the
plasticizing performance of the latter and may reduce costs. PVC formulations con￾sume a large majority of plasticizers. Other polymers where plasticizers have some
importance are polyacrylates, polyvinyl butyral (PVB), cellulose esters, polyvinyl ace￾tate (PVAc), polylactic acid (PLA) and rubbers. Partially crystalline polymers such as
PET or polyamides are difficult to plasticize.
Plasticizers are, volume-wise, the largest class of plastic additives based on or￾ganic chemistry. Therefore, commercial products are numerous [1]. Plasticizers can
be considered chemically as (weak) solvents for the polymer to be plasticized. Nearly
all plasticizers are esters of aromatic, cycloaliphatic or aliphatic acids with long-chain
alcohols (Figure 4.2). Historically, despite environmental concerns and bans on some
applications such as children´s toys in Europe, phthalates still represent a substantial
part of plasticizers. Typical examples of phthalates include di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate
(DEHP, (117-81-7)), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP, (26761-40-0), (68515-49-1)) and diisononyl
phthalate (DINP, 28553-12-0). Other aromatic esters are derivatives of terephthalic
acid, e.g., di-2-hexylethyl terephthalate (DEHT, 6422-86-2) or of trimellitic acid, e.g., tri￾octyl trimellitate (L8TM, 3319-31-1). Aliphatic polyesters comprise, e.g., esters of adipic
acid or sebacic acid, e.g., diisononyl adipate (DINA, 33703-08-1) or diisodecyl sebacate
(DIDS, 28473-19-0) and more recently citric acid esters, e.g., tributyl citrate (TBC, 77-94-
1) or tributyl 2-acetylcitrate (ATBC, 77-90-7). Cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylates are exam￾ples of cycloaliphatic esters, e.g., diisononyl cyclohexanoate (DINCH, 166412-78-8).
Phosphate esters, e.g., tricresyl phosphate (TCP, 1330-78-5) or tri-2-ethylhexyl) phos￾phate (TOF, 78-42-2) contribute to the flame retardancy of the polymer in addition to
the plasticizing effect. Examples of secondary plasticizers (which are also called “ex￾tenders”) are chlorinated hydrocarbons, isobutyrate esters or epoxidized oils such as
epoxidized soybean oil (ESO, 8013-07-8) that simultaneously act as a stabilizer in PVC.
To cope with migration, leaching, emissions and toxicity issues, strategies include
using raw materials from natural resources [2–4] (e.g., citric acid esters, natural oil such
as cardanol or castor oil derivatives, or sugar-based products such as isosorbide esters
[5]). Other strategies involve oligomeric or polymeric plasticizers based on aliphatic di￾functional acids (e.g., poly(butylene)adipate (25103-87-1) [6] or palm oil derivatives [7])
and mixtures with inorganic additives [8]. For sensitive applications, such as medical
48 4 Additives to adjust mechanical properties of polymersapplications, toys or food packaging, citric acid esters are preferred [9]. The market
share of plasticizers based on renewable resources is already above 10%, making them,
along with lubricants, the leading bio-derived additive class. The ultimate solution and
a fundamental change would be to move from external plasticizers as additives to inter￾nal plasticizers by copolymers or grafting reactions [10].
The technical performance of plasticizers is related to gelation capacity, compati￾bility, volatility, extraction resistance, water solubility, aging resistance and weather￾ing/light stability. The efficiency of plastification is measured by the resulting glass
transition temperature and the achieved hardness (or softness) and the necessary
plasticizer concentration [11]. Torque rheometers are used to determine the compati￾bility and gelation of plasticized polymers. Gelation behavior (measured as the tem￾perature to fuse the plasticizer/PVC mixture) varies between 80 and 180 °C, depending
on the plasticizer activity. Furthermore, performance at high (processing) and low
temperature (application) is relevant. For example, adipate plasticizers allow use at
lower temperatures than phthalates. Even rather small concentration changes show a
considerable influence on properties, e.g., increasing the plasticizer concentration
from 37% to 42% decreases the glass transition temperature from −7.5 °C to −21.5 °C
(unplasticized PVC: 70–90 °C) [12]. Plasticizers are usually applied in comparatively
high concentrations between 10% and 40%.
Antiplasticization is a phenomenon that occurs in many polymers when plasticiz￾ers or small molecules are added in the percent range and at lower concentrations
than usually necessary for plasticization. Through antiplasticization, the mechanical
properties such as the flexural modulus or tensile strength are increased. The effect
depends on the molecular weight of the polymer and the interaction with end groups.

diphenylmethane (101-14-4) [14] or polyamide and various phenols [15]. Antiplasticiza￾tion could be of interest for PET where the addition of antiplasticizers (e.g., dimethyl
terephthalate (120-61-6)) may decrease the oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability of
films [16].

50 4 Additives to adjust mechanical properties of polymers4.5 Impact modifiers
Impact modifiers are incorporated in polymers to balance mechanical properties
and provide increased toughness. Some polymers, such as polystyrenes, rigid PVC or
polylactic acid (PLA), are brittle even at ambient temperature. Other polymers such
as polyamides, polyesters, polymethylmethacrylate or polypropylene tend to become
brittle at low temperatures below 0 °C. Another important application area of impact
modifiers or tougheners is thermoset composites [1, 2] as epoxy resins, especially for
aerospace applications or coatings.
Adding impact modifiers increases toughness, impact strength, elongation at break
and flexibility, whereas E-modulus, tensile strength and heat distortion temperature
are often reduced. Impact modifiers are mainly polymers with low glass transition tem￾peratures and elastomeric behavior. Distributed homogeneously in the polymer matrix
to be toughened, impact modifiers show two mechanisms: The elastomeric phase of the
impact modifier absorbs the energy and dissipates it by the formation of either crazes
or shear bands, thus preventing the propagation of cracks and protecting the matrix
polymer from macroscopic cracking [3]. To act according to the mechanism, a certain
concentration of the impact modifier, often between 3% and 25%, is used to provide a
substantial effect.
Impact modification can be achieved during polymer synthesis by copolymerization
with suitable monomers or polymers. For example, high-impact polystyrene is manufac￾tured in the presence of polybutadiene as an elastomeric component or impact polypro￾pylene in the presence of ethylene and dienes. Impact modifiers in the form of additives
are usually incorporated into the polymer by a compounding step. Suitable impact modi￾fiers have to be selected about the polymer to be toughened. Selection criteria include
compatibility with the host polymer, dispersibility in the polymer matrix, potential reac￾tivity with the polymer forming chemical bonds, attainable low-temperature perfor￾mance and the influence of the additive on processing steps, e.g., melt viscosity of the
formulation. Depending on the chemical structure and the size of the impact modifier in
the polymer, the visual properties (transparency, surface quality, gloss) may be nega￾tively influenced. Impact modifiers based on polybutadiene or other polymers with dou￾ble bonds may lower thermal stability during processing steps, long-term thermal
stability and UV/weathering resistance compared to the matrix polymer. Therefore, ad￾justment of stabilizer packages is necessary. Impact modifiers based on acrylates are
less influenced by UV radiation.
Impact modifier additives consist of a wide range of polymeric structures and are
used in various combinations with different polymer classes (Table 4.2). The main
consumer of impact modifiers is rigid PVC, which accounts for more than 80% of the
market [4].
Individual impact modifier classes include styrene copolymers such as acrylonitrile–
butadiene–styrene (ABS), methacrylate–acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (MABS),
methacrylate–butadiene–styrene (MBS), styrene–butadiene–styrene block copolymers
4.5 Impact modifiers 51(SBS), styrene–ethylene/butylene–styrene block copolymers (SEBS), styrene–isoprene–
styrene block copolymers (SIS) as well as SBS and SEBS maleic anhydride (MAH) graft
structures. Acrylate-based impact modifiers (AIM) are often n-butyl acrylate copolymers
with other acrylates or methacrylates. Typical polyolefin-based impact modifiers are not
only ethylene–propylene elastomers (EPM) or ethylene–propylene–diene elastomers
(EPDM) but also ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA). Chlorinated polyethylene (CPE)
is a well-known impact modifier for PVC. Acrylate impact modifiers are often manufac￾tured by core-shell technologies. Core-shell microspheres consist of an elastomeric core,
e.g., from poly-n-butyl acrylate, surrounded by a shell with a higher glass transition tem￾perature, e.g., polymethyl methacrylate. This approach allows convenient handling of the
toughening agent and improves dispersion and compatibility with the matrix.
As with other additive areas, renewable materials were also investigated for im￾pact modifiers, such as epoxidized natural rubber [5, 6] or bio-based polyesters [7].
Toughening biodegradable polymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA), may preferably re￾quire biodegradable impact modifiers [7, 8].
Mechanical tests, especially impact strength or notched impact strength (according to
Izod: ISO 180, Charpy: ISO 179) at ambient and low temperatures (−30 °C), are important
testing parameters. However, the influence of impact modifiers on other mechanical
properties, processing and interactions with other additives must also be considered.

4.6 Compatibilizers/coupling agents
Compatibilizers improve the mechanical properties of incompatible polymer blends
on a macroscopic level. Polymers of different structures are, with very few exceptions,
generally not miscible thermodynamically and, therefore, do not form homogeneous
blends. The polymer in the highest concentration generates a continuous phase, while
the polymer with the lower concentration is dispersed in this continuous matrix. The
resulting mechanical properties of the blend are usually inferior to those of the par￾ent polymers because the intermolecular adhesion between the continuous and dis￾persed phases is very weak. Compatibilizers modify polymer interphases by reducing
the interfacial tension in the melt, stabilizing the dispersed phase against growth dur￾ing annealing (“morphology stabilizers”) and increasing the adhesion at phase bound￾aries. In addition to the targeted improvement of mechanical properties, processing
may be ameliorated, and the surface quality of produced parts is improved. The size
of the dispersed phase is reduced significantly compared to an uncompatibilized
blend.
To function as compatibilizers, polymer structures and reactive functional units
are selected that are similar or reactive to the polymers to be compatibilized (1, 2).
Therefore, reactive and nonreactive compatibilizers are available depending on the
particular polymers. Reactive compatibilizers are, for example, applied for blends of
polyolefins with polyamides or polyesters. Typical structures include acrylic acid poly￾ethylene copolymers (9010-77-9) or maleic acid anhydride-grafted polyethylene (9006-

Nonreactive compatibilizers enhance, for example, the properties of polyethylene/
polypropylene blends or polystyrene/polyolefin blends. Therefore, examples include
polyethylene–polypropylene block copolymers (9010-79-1) or polystyrene (ethylene/
butylene) styrene triblock copolymers (66070-58-4). Compatibilizer concentrations in
the range of 5–15 w% are often needed to show the required improvements. Research
in complex compatibilizer structures is ongoing [3]; however, universal structures to
compatibilize all different polymers will be difficult to identify. Another possibility to
compatibilize polymer blends, especially recyclates, is the addition of surface-modified
fillers, where the functional modifier can react with the polymer [4].
Coupling agents are preferably used to improve the adhesion of fillers and rein￾forcements, e.g., glass fibers or carbon fibers, to any polymer matrix [5]. Like compati￾bilizers, coupling agents consist of a structural part that is compatible with the polymer
and another part that is reactive with the filler or reinforcement. Examples of simple
coupling agents for fillers are fatty acids, such as stearic acid (57-11-4), calcium stearate
(1592-23-0), zinc stearate (557-05-1) or magnesium stearate (557-04-0). Another important
class of coupling agents includes silanes with amino, epoxy or methacryloyl functional￾ity (Figure 4.4). More sophisticated coupling agents are based on complex titanates and
zirconates, e.g., isopropyltri(dioctylphosphate) titanate (65345-34-8) [6, 7]. Optimized con￾centrations of coupling agents depend on the individual filler or pigment and the filler/
reinforcement surface area and are found in the range of 0.2–5 wt%.

4.7 Dispersants
Dispersants are related to coupling agents and compatibilizers; however, their func￾tion is very similar. The expression “compatibilizer” is mainly used to describe agents
that improve the compatibility of polymers, while “coupling agents” enhance the ad￾hesion between fillers or reinforcing agents and the polymer. “Dispersants” are used
to reduce the particle size and distribute an insoluble additive homogeneously in the
polymer matrix, simultaneously improving compatibility with the matrix. Dispersants
are often used for pigments but can also improve the efficiency of other additives,
such as antioxidants or flame retardants [1]. Their structures include fatty acid salts,
such as calcium stearate (1592-23-0) or zinc stearate (557-05-1), acrylate polymers and
more sophisticated tailor-made block copolymers adjusted to the structures of pig-

56 4 Additives to adjust mechanical properties of polymers5 Additives to adjust rheological properties
of plastics
5.1 Lubricants
Lubricants (and processing aids, see section 5.2) are incorporated to decrease the high
melt viscosity of the polymer melt or to reduce internal and external friction, minimiz￾ing interactions of the polymer with the metal surfaces of the typical processing equip￾ment. By reducing viscosity, throughput can be increased, degradation of the polymer
by shear is reduced and sometimes mechanical properties and surface quality, e.g.,
gloss, are improved. Lubricants are among the class of additives applied in most poly￾mers. The main consumer of lubricants is rigid PVC, where these additives are essential
for the fusion process and for preventing thermal degradation in conjunction with heat
stabilizers [1, 2], followed by polyolefins, thermosets and some engineering plastics (pol￾yamides, polyesters and polyacetals). Other benefits of lubricants include their role as
dispersion agents for filled polymers or pigments and as carriers for masterbatches or
concentrates, compatibilizers, coupling agents, release agents and slip agents.
One may distinguish between internal and external lubricants, although most of
them will show both effects to different extents. Internal lubricants are soluble in the
polymer melt and can reduce the melt viscosity, while external lubricants are insolu￾ble, forming a film between the metal surfaces of the processing equipment and the
polymer melt, and thus reducing friction and often showing a slip effect. The selection
of suitable lubricants and their concentration depends on the polymer structure (e.g.,
polarity, processing temperature) and the compatibility of the lubricant with the poly￾mer. Compatibility and solubility are important parameters to avoid deposits or plate￾outs during manufacturing. For example, optimized waxes for PVC depend on the ap￾plication, the processing conditions and the stabilizer package [3].
The range of lubricants for plastics starts with low-molecular hydrocarbons, e.g.,
paraffin or mineral oil, polyethylene waxes and polypropylene waxes either produced
by Ziegler-Natta or metallocene polymerization, including oxidized versions, e.g., oxi￾dized polyethylene waxes. These waxes are often formulation ingredients as internal
lubricants in PVC and polyolefins. Another important class of lubricants includes
metal salts of long-chain acids, which may act as stabilizers, e.g., in PVC formulations
or as acid scavengers in polyolefins. Examples are calcium stearate (1592-23-0), alumi￾num stearate (637-12-7), zinc stearate (557-05-1) or salts of montan waxes, e.g., calcium
montanate (68308-22-5). The latter are mainly used in polyester and polyamide formu￾lations. Amide waxes, e.g., erucamide (112-84-5), oleic acid amide (301-02-0) or N,N′-
ethylene bis(stearamide) (110-30-5), provide internal and external lubrication of PVC
and polyolefins with slip and antiblocking efficiency in films (see section 7.3). Mix￾tures of long-chain aliphatic esters (e.g., myristate) of similar alcohols (e.g., cetylalco￾https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110986358-005hol) are claimed to improve the processing of polyesters (e.g., PET) [4]. As lubricants
are used for food packaging, bio-based materials from vegetable oils are in demand.
Combinations of different lubricant structures, i.e., internal and external efficiency,
are also usual, e.g., in PVC formulations.
The concentration of lubricants starts in the range of 0.1% (polyolefins, engineer￾ing plastics) up to several percent (PVC). Testing of lubricants is done using torque
rheometer to determine fusion time and torque, a capillary viscosimeter to analyze
the melt rheology or an injection mold to measure the spiral flow length.
The molecular weight and structure of the lubricant will influence its migration
behavior. Migration can affect the visual appearance of the plastic part, e.g., through
loss of gloss, deposits or even stickiness. For example, it was shown that magnesium
stearate migrates less than calcium stearate in polypropylene during heat aging [5].

5.2 Processing aids
Processing aids are related to lubricants, and they can improve the processability of
polymers. More specifically, these additives are used to avoid melt fracture, which re￾sults in a rough surface, commonly known as “shark-skin formation,” during extru￾sion at high shear rates or when producing thin articles such as polyethylene or
polypropylene films, primarily LLDPE and HDPE. Fluoropolymers are the most com￾mon (e.g., copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene), covering the
metal surfaces of the production equipment with a slippery coating. This reduces the
coefficient of friction, lowers extruder pressure and increases throughput [1]. Fluoro￾polymers are applied in concentrations between 0.01% and 0.1%.
As fluorinated additives are facing environmental pressure, fluorine-free alterna￾tives have been developed. On the basis of a similar mechanism of covering the metal
surface, polydimetylsiloxanes have been proposed [2]. Furthermore, polyethylene gly￾58 5 Additives to adjust rheological properties of plasticscol of specific molecular weight and combinations of polyethylene glycol with a sur￾factant, e.g., sorbitan ester, are known [3–5]. The necessary loadings are slightly
higher compared to fluoropolymers, and the additives have to be adjusted by molecu￾lar weight and end groups to the individual polyethylene grade. Fluoropolymers seem
to be more “universal.” All these “migrating” substances may cause deposits on the
metal surfaces, cross-contaminations and undesirable surface effects on the manufac￾tured polymer article.
Another class of additives to increase productivity consists of neoalkoxy titanates
and neoalkoxy zirconates, which are multifunctional processing aids, resulting in en￾ergy saving by reduced processing temperatures and reduced cycle time, e.g., in injec￾tion molding [7]. This class of processing aids is not only limited to polyolefins but is
also suitable for polystyrenics and engineering plastics, such as PBT.
A different approach to solving melt fracture issues in polyethylene (LLDPE) is
the addition of melt-compatible additives that crystallize above the melting tempera￾ture of the polymer in needle-like shapes, known otherwise as “nucleating agents,”
e.g., trisamides or sorbitols [8]. It seems that the needle-like calcium hexahydrophtha￾late [491589-22-1] may act analogously [9]. Moreover, for selected polyethylene grades,
combinations of talc as a nucleating agent and a slip agent, e.g., behenamide, reduce
the coefficient of friction [10].

Adding chain extenders results in a molecular weight increase of the polymer and
improvements in properties, such as mechanical properties of the achieved high￾molecular-weight grade. As chain extenders are often applied in the recycling of plas￾tics, they are also denoted as “repair additives.” The process involves the reaction of
functional groups of the chain extender with functional groups of the polymer. There￾fore, the polymers of choice are polycondensation polymers, mainly polyesters (–OH
and –COOH end groups) or polyamides (–NH2 and –COOH end groups), carrying func￾tional and reactive end groups. The reaction usually takes place during a compounding
step. There are two strategies: either to add a difunctional molecule to get a linear
chain extension or to add a multifunctional additive or functional polymer to get a star￾like or branched structure. For the linear chain extension, difunctional molecules are
based on diepoxides (e.g., bisphenol-A-diglycidylether ((1675-54-3)), bis-oxazolines (e.g.,
1,3-phenylene-bis-oxazoline (34052-90-9)), bis-oxazolinones, bis-oxazines, diisocyanates,
dianhydrides (e.g., pyromellitic dianhydride (89-32-7)), bis-acyllactams (19494-73-6), bis￾maleimides, dicyanates, (poly)carbodiimides (25215-75-2), diesters (Figure 5.1) and others
[1–3], sometimes combined with catalysts to accelerate the bond-forming reaction.
Depending on the reactivity of the end groups of the polymer, as well as the selection
and concentration of the chain extender, tailor-made products can be manufactured.
However, the reactive process must be carefully monitored to avoid production fluc￾tuations and to ensure a complete reaction without any remaining unreacted chain
extender. Some reactive components, e.g., pyromellitic dianhydride, will also induce
subsequent reactions like branching. Concentrations of the chain extender vary from
0.05% up to several percent. For example, production scrap from polyamide-6.6 is re￾paired or upcycled by adding diepoxides (and a phosphonate catalyst) in the range of

60 5 Additives to adjust rheological properties of plastics0.7%, and the mechanical properties are substantially enhanced [4]. Furthermore,
combinations of chain extenders and moderators can result in optimized processing
behavior [5, 6].
The addition of phosphites [7, 8] or polymers with reactive side groups [9–11],
such as glycidyl acrylate copolymers (51541-08-3), generates branching. However, at
higher additive concentrations, there is a risk of cross-linking, gel formation and non￾thermoplastic behavior. In general, concentrations of the nonlinear chain extenders
must be adjusted according to the molecular weight of the starting polymer, end
group concentrations and targeted molecular weight or properties, and are often
found between 0.2% and 2.0%.
Instead of reactive extrusion, the molecular weight build-up process can be per￾formed through solid-state polycondensation (SSP), wherein a crystallized polyester
(or polyamide) in the form of granules or flakes is treated at high temperatures, but
below the melting point, for several hours in a vacuum or through an inert gas flow [12].
Chain extenders can be used in combination with SSP to adjust polymer properties and
accelerate the solid-state reaction [13, 14].
Contrary to polycondensation polymers, the molecular weight build-up of poly￾merization polymers, such as polypropylene, polyethylene or polystyrene, is unattain￾able, as defined reactive end groups do not exist. In some cases, it is possible to use
the formed chemical groups from aging processes or chemical pretreatment to link
polymer chains. These groups include, for example, alcohol, acid, ketone or double
bond functions. Double bonds in smaller concentrations are nearly always available
in polyethylenes from side reactions during polymerization or from aging processes
that are suitable for branching or slight cross-linking. For example, greenhouse films
could be “repaired” by adding an ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate copolymer or a hy￾droxylamine radical generator [15, 16]. In addition, other radical generators are useful
to modify the rheology and the molecular weight of polymerization polymers by
branching reactions. However, there is a risk of cross-linking, and processing has to
be very carefully controlled [17]. Furthermore, long-chain branching of polypropylene
through radical reactions in reactive extrusion processes in the presence of styrene
was proposed for the upcycling of recyclates [18]. Moreover, a certain chain extension
of polypropylene can be achieved by combining radical generators and multifunc￾tional acrylates [19]. With certain titanates and zirconates, even the possibility of re￾polymerization is claimed [20].
The influence of chain extenders on polymer properties is evaluated by a de￾crease in the melt flow, increase in the molecular weight, e.g., measured by size exclu￾sion chromatography (SEC) and modification of rheological values, evaluated, e.g., by
capillary viscometry. Ideally, there is a direct relationship between chain-extender
concentration and melt flow or molecular weight of the polymer, as schematically
shown in Figure 5.2.

5.4 Additives for controlled degradation of polymers
Additives to reduce the molecular weight of polymers have several different applica￾tions, namely the manufacturing of low-molecular-weight polypropylene (e.g., for
fiber applications), molecular weight degradation of polycondensation polymers (e.g.,
polyesters or polyamides) and the accelerated degradation of polymers in outdoor ap￾plications or the environment.
Polypropylene for fibers, thin-wall injection molding and other easy-flowing
grades are manufactured through molecular weight degradation by adding radical
generators in extrusion processes. The radical generators cleave the polymer chain
and adjust, depending on the additive concentration and the process parameters, mo￾lecular weight and molecular weight distribution [1, 2]. This process is called “vis￾breaking.” Peroxides are mainly used as radical generators, for example, 2,5-dimethyl
-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy) hexane (78-63-7, Figure 5.3) or dicumylperoxide (80-43-3). Hy￾droxylamine esters (e.g., 376588-17-9) are available alternatives with easier handling and
result in improved mechanical properties of nonwovens produced by this process [3, 4].
The performance of hydroxylamine esters can be further enhanced by combinations
with sulfonamides [5]. Other potential radical generator chemistries include azoal￾kanes [6] and oxyimides [7]. The used concentrations of radical generators for con￾trolled degradation are in the range of up to 2%.
In the recycling processes of polyamides or polyesters (or other polycondensation
polymers), the need may arise to reduce the molecular weight to obtain a product with
5.4 Additives for controlled degradation of polymers 63higher melt flow, e.g., for injection molding applications from extrusion grades. As poly￾condensation polymers can be hydrolyzed, the addition of a small quantity of water is
already a potential method [8]. However, molecular weight reduction by water in an
extrusion process is difficult to control. Alternatively, the so-called chain-breaking
agents can be used to control the molecular weight degradation process, e.g., dicarbox￾ylic acids or anhydrides, which can be used as masterbatches. To optimize the process,
combinations of chain-breaking and chain-extending agents may be used [9]. The hy￾drolysis of biodegradable polyesters, such as polylactic acid (PLA), polybutylene succi￾nate (PBS) or polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) [10], can be accelerated in composting or
agricultural applications by the addition of aliphatic phosphites or phosphates. In the
first step, hydrolysis of the phosphate results in phosphoric acid, which catalyzes the
hydrolysis reaction of the polyester in the second step [11].
Contrary to polycondensation polymers, the degradation of polyolefins and other
polymerization polymers is comparatively slow in the environment, especially if
these polymers are well stabilized against aging and UV light. Therefore, additives
were developed mainly for agricultural and packaging applications to accelerate the
degradation by light and heat.
Ideally, the degradation time can be programmed. Increased photo-oxidative
degradation is achieved by adding photosensitizers, such as carbonyl-containing
species like diketones [12]. Additives for oxidative degradation are based on metal
salts, e.g., iron, cerium or cobalt fatty acid salts [13, 14]. However, the oxidation in
the absence of light seems to remain slow [15]. Moreover, the number of microplastics in
the environment will increase; therefore, the application of prodegradants in polyolefins,
for example, agricultural applications, might be questionable.

5.5 Additives for branching/grafting/cross-linking
Modifying polymers through reactive processes is an important way to adjust proper￾ties, introduce functionalization and manufacture novel materials. These processes
can be performed during the synthesis of polymers as well as during processing in
5.5 Additives for branching/grafting/cross-linking 65the compounding or form-giving step by additives. From an industrial point of view,
the modification of polyolefins is most important. However, many polymers and func￾tionalities, even for pharmaceutical applications, are accessible through grafting reac￾tions [1, 2].
To adjust the rheological behavior of polymers for specific transformation pro￾cesses and applications, the introduction of branches is a potential approach. Usually,
branching is accompanied by an increase in the molecular weight (see also Sec￾tion 5.2). Branches of polycondensation polymers (polyesters, polyamides) can be in￾troduced by multifunctional additives. Long-chain branching of polyamides is feasible
through carboxylic esters [3]. Polyols and/or dianhydrides provide branching by trans￾esterification reactions of polyesters, potentially in the presence of a catalyst [4, 5]. The
addition of dianhydrides (e.g., pyromellitic dianhydride (89-32-7)) in the range between
0.1% and 1% allows a considerable increase in melt strength and thus the production of
PET foams, films and the use of PET for thermoforming processes [6–8].
In polymerization polymers, branching can only take place by radical reactions
in a grafting reaction initiated by radical generators. Radical generators create macro￾radicals on the polymer backbone, while added monomers react with the created
macroradicals [6]. The main application of this process is the manufacturing of maleic
anhydride-modified polypropylene, polyethylene or styrene–butadiene–styrene block
copolymer (see Figure 4.5) and other polyolefin variations. Other graftable monomers
besides maleic anhydride include acrylic acid, itaconic acid or glycidyl(meth)acrylate [9].
The radical generators are usually organic peroxides such as alkyl/aryl peroxides (e.g.,
dicumylperoxide (80-43-3)), peroxyester (614-45-9) and diaroylperoxides (e.g., diben￾zoylperoxide (94-36-0)) (Figure 5.4). During the radical processes, the grafting reaction
is always in competition with side reactions, e.g., molecular weight degradation of
polypropylene and/or branching/cross-linking of polyethylene or polymerization of
the monomer to be grafted (which is not an issue with maleic anhydride as it does not
polymerize at the usual processing temperatures). Another issue in potential applica￾tions may be residual unreacted monomers, which should be minimized [10–12].
Therefore, many combinations to favor grafting versus side reactions have been eval￾uated to optimize the grafting processes. These modulators (mediators) include, for
example, 2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO (2564-83-2)) derivatives, alkyl￾thiuramdisulfides, dithiocarbamates, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, (128-08-5)) and others
(Figure 5.4). The ratio of radical generator, grafting monomer and modulator must be
carefully adjusted. In general, the monomer concentration is highest and the modula￾tor concentration is lowest. For example, by adding NBS (1.22%) to a peroxide (2%)
initiated grafting of maleic anhydride (5%), above 2.5% grafted MAH can be achieved
with a moderate molecular weight reduction [13]. The resulting modified polymers
are used as adhesion promoters and compatibilizers between polymers, polymer and
metal, polymer and fillers or polymer and reinforcement agents. Furthermore, long￾chain branching of polypropylene by radical reactions in reactive extrusion processes
in the presence of styrene was proposed for upcycling of recyclates [14], for grafting
66 5 Additives to adjust rheological properties of plasticsof multifunctional acrylates [15] and for a high number of functionalities with den￾drimers [16] to improve melt strength for thermoforming or blow molding processes.
Cross-linking of polymers results in a three-dimensional network and is common in ther￾mosetting resins (curing, hardening) and rubber processing (vulcanization). Cross￾linking of thermoplastic polymers, mainly polyethylene, is used in wire and cable insula￾tion, pipe and foam applications. To achieve cross-linking, radical generators (sometimes
in combination with graftable monomers) are added, such as the already mentioned per￾oxides. By cleavage of the peroxy group, free radicals are formed, abstracting hydrogen
from the polymer. The formed macroradical recombines with another one, finally form￾ing the three-dimensional network after several reaction steps. If reactive monomers
are present, the macroradical may react with the monomer in a grafting reaction, com￾peting with recombination. The latter is used, e.g., in wire and cable insulation, when
organofunctional silanes, e.g., vinyltrialkoxysilanes, are grafted onto polyethylene in the
presence of peroxides. The silane-functionalized polyethylene is cross-linked in a conse￾cutive step by water [17].
Alternatively to organic peroxides CC-initiators, e.g., 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-diphenylbutane
(1889-67-4), hydroxylamine esters [18], unsymmetric azo compounds [19] or oxyimides [20]
can be used for cross-linking reactions, especially at higher processing temperatures.
Concentrations of cross-linking agents depend on the required cross-linking density, the
application and the production process, and vary between 1% and 5%.

6.1 Flame retardants
Most standard (polyolefins, polystyrenics) and technical polymers (polyesters, polya￾mides) can be easily incinerated. Burning plastics show a high energy load and risk.
Only halogen-containing polymers (PVC, fluorinated polymers) and a few inherently
flame-retarded high-performance polymers (polyether ketones, polyether sulfones,
polyimides) are less sensitive to fire. Adding flame or fire retardants to polymers is
the method of choice to reduce the fire risk in the transport, electro/electronic, con￾struction, textile and furniture industries. Therefore, flame retardants are among the
most important additive classes, reflected in the annual consumption. Moreover, with
the trend to reduce fire risks and enhance safety, the importance of efficient flame
retardants and flame-retarded polymer formulations is increasing. Flame retardants
do not transform the polymer into a nonburning material but delay the time until in￾cineration and burning take place. The thermal decomposition pathway of the poly￾mer is often altered, resulting in less easily burning gases. Burning plastic drips need
to be avoided to hinder fire spreading, and smoke density is reduced. In the end, the
damage caused by the fire can be avoided or reduced by incorporating flame retard￾ants in the plastic formulation.
The chemical structures of flame or fire retardants in use are manifold and are
selected based on the polymer to be flame-retarded and the standards to be fulfilled
in the particular application.
Historically and still, the most universal flame retardants are halogen-containing ad￾ditives, mainly brominated compounds (Figure 6.1). However, because of environmental
reasons (toxicity, persistence [1]), several products have already been phased out in
some areas, e.g., in Europe, or have been replaced with less critical options, either halo￾gen-free or halogen-containing. For example, hexabromocyclododecane (3194-55-6) was
used for decades in polystyrene construction foam applications and was replaced with a
polymeric aliphatic brominated structure based on styrene–butadiene–styrene block co￾polymers (1439473-04-7) [2]. Overall, brominated flame retardants still claim a substantial
market share and provide flame retardancy for many engineering polymers, e.g., poly￾butylene terephthalate (PBT) or polyamides, polystyrenes, polyolefins, epoxy resins and
polyurethanes.
Bromo compounds are active during combustion in the gas phase, whereas HBr
reacts with OH and H radicals during thermal degradation processes, forming less re￾active halogen radicals (so-called flame poisoning). The flame retardancy of bromo
compounds is often synergistically improved by adding antimony oxide Sb2O3 (1309-
64-4). Antimony oxide reacts with the bromo groups, forming antimony bromide, and
the concentration of bromo radicals in the gas phase is increased. However, nowadays
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110986358-006antimony oxide is also seen as a critical additive. Therefore, alternatives based on
zinc stannates [3] or radical generators on nitrogen basis [4] have been proposed.
Another well-established class of flame retardants is inorganic materials, namely
aluminum trihydroxide ((21,645-51-2), ATH), aluminum oxihydroxide ((1318-23-6), boehm￾ite) and magnesium dihydroxide ((1309-42-8), MDH). Furthermore, mineral flame retard￾ants are huntite (Mg3Ca(CO3)4 (19569-21-2)) and hydromagnesite (Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2x4H2O
(12275-04-6, 12072-90-1)) or a natural mixture of both. At elevated temperatures, these hy￾droxides decompose endothermically (“heat sink”) with the formation of water and the
corresponding metal oxides. Therefore, these flame retardants act in the condensed
phase by eliminating heat and diluting the burning gases. A disadvantage of the inor￾ganic flame retardants is the high loading of more than 50 wt% needed to generate suffi￾cient water for the fire protection mechanism. Large quantities of metal hydroxides are
used, e.g., in polyethylene wire and cable applications.
Flame retardant synergists for metal hydroxides include calcium borate (13840-
55-6) on a silica carrier [5], zinc borate [1332-07-6], zinc (hydroxy) stannate (21172-59-8)
[6], nanoclays [7–9] and many other components [10] to stabilize the formed oxide layer.
For example, by adding 5% of organically modified clay (montmorillonite (1318-93-0)),
the loading of ATH in EVA cable materials can be decreased from 65% to 45%, without
losing the low heat release rate [11]. The search for novel inorganic flame retardants is
ongoing. For example, carbon nanotubes [12], graphene [13] and other carbon com￾pounds have been proposed as flame retardant components acting through the barrier
formation at the surface and thus insulating the polymer from the flame source.
The class of phosphorus-based flame retardants represents, on the one hand, tra￾ditional phosphates and, on the other hand, efficient alternatives to halogenated
flame retardants (Figure 6.2). Red phosphorus can be used as an efficient flame re￾tardant, e.g., in polyamides. Phosphates, e.g., ammonium polyphosphate (68333-79-9),

70 6 Additives to extend plastic propertiesbisphenol-A-diphenyl phosphate (5945-33-5) or resorcinol bis(di-2,6-xylyl phosphate)
(139189-30-3), are well established in polyolefins or styrenics. Besides the classical
phosphates, the aluminum salt of diethylphosphinate (225789-38-8) is used, e.g., in
polyamides, and 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO, 35948-25-
5) is an alternative to, e.g., tetrabromo-bisphenol A (79-94-7) in epoxy resins. Research
on DOPO derivatives [14] and other phosphorus-based flame retardants is extensive.
Even phosphorus-based flame retardants based on natural resources, where phythic
acid (83-86-3) is a key element, are known [15]. Phosphorus-containing flame retard￾ants often function by the formation of a barrier layer in the condensed phase and/
or by PO radical species in the gas phase.
Similar to phosphorus flame retardants, nitrogen-based materials consist of traditional
products such as melamine (108-78-1) and melamine derivatives, such as melamine cya￾nurate (37640-57-6) or melamine polyphosphate (41583-09-9), other triazines [16], and
more recently, products generating radicals (Figure 6.3). Melamine is an inert diluent
and removes heat by decomposition. Melamine polyphosphate provides an isolating
barrier by an intumescent mechanism and can be used, e.g., in polyamides. Melamine
cyanurate is mainly used in polyamide-6, where a melt degradation and nonburning
dripping mechanism is responsible for providing flame retardancy. The chemistry of
radical generators is based on alkoxyamines [17], azo compounds [18], oxyimides [19] or
sulfenamides [20]. These flame retardants act during incineration during fast degradation
of the polymer (mainly of polyolefins) and a “run-away” mechanism with nonburning
dripping, thus removing the polymer from the flame. Furthermore, as radical reactions
in the gas phase take place and the burning temperature is reduced, flame retardancy is
achieved at comparatively low loadings compared to other flame retardants. In many
cases, radical generators can be combined synergistically with phosphorus-containing
flame retardants, such as with a spirophosphonate (3001-98-7).

6.1 Flame retardants 71Likewise, with other additive classes, flame retardants based on natural resources are
a research topic of considerable interest [21–23].
Closely related to flame retardants are smoke suppressants added to the polymer
to reduce the generation of smoke in case of fire. Typical examples are molybdenum
trioxide (MoO3, (1313-27-5)) and ammonium octamolybdate (AOM, (NH4)4Mo8O26, (12411-
64-2)), mainly used in PVC formulations [24]. Other additives that can reduce smoke are
zinc borates and stannates.
Flame-retarded plastic formulations, e.g., polycarbonates or polyesters, may con￾tain additional antidripping agents. The standard antidripping agent for many years
has been polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) powder or copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene,
where the antidripping effect is achieved by fibrillation during the burning process [25].
As alternative antidripping agents, polysiloxanes [26] or phosphorus-containing acryl￾ates [27] are known.
The performance of flame-retarded formulations is evaluated by different applica￾tions and country-specific standards. As a developmental tool, often limiting oxygen
index (LOI, e.g., according to ISO 4589) and Underwriter Laboratory UL 94 (or DIN EN
IEC 60,695) tests are used. In the LOI evaluation, a standardized specimen is burned in
a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. The higher the oxygen content required to support
burning, the more resistant to burning is the material. LOI values range from 15%
(POM) to 95% (PTFE); most commodity polymers range between 17% and 25%. Above
27%, self-extinguishing behavior can often be expected [28]. The UL 94 test ignites a de￾fined sample at the bottom, burned vertically and according to flame time, dripping
and ignition of underlying cotton; it is classified according to V-0 (best classification),
V-1, V-2 and NC (not classified). For example, unreinforced polyamide-6 is easily
flame-retarded by adding 8–12% of melamine cyanurate (37640-57-6) to achieve a UL 94 V-0

72 6 Additives to extend plastic propertiesrating. Glass fiber-reinforced polyamide-6 achieves only a V-2 rating at 20% of mela￾mine cyanurate (37640-57-6), whereas 25% of melamine polyphosphate (41583-09-9) may
result in V-0. However, often synergistic combinations between different flame retard￾ants are used for cost-performance reasons, e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus compounds
together. For instance, the combination of diethylaluminum phosphinate (225789-38-8)
and melamine polyphosphate (41583-09-9) results in a V-0 classification of glass fiber￾reinforced polyamide 6.6 at a total concentration of 12–15% [29]. Although many appli￾cation-specific formulations dominate flame-retarded polymers, some general combina￾tions and loadings can be exemplified (Table 6.1).

6.2 Pigments
An attractive or particular color is an important feature of plastic applications and
branding. Pigments are the most important representatives of coloring agents for
plastics. Contrary to the textile market, dyes hold a very minor share in the plastics
market. Pigments are usually dispersed solid particles insoluble in the polymer ma￾trix, whereas dyes are soluble and, therefore, can maintain the transparency of a plas￾tic article. The addition of pigments to the polymer can provide any required color
shade, from brilliant white to dark black and all colors of the spectrum including blue
to green, yellow, red and violet. The so-called color index (CI) is assigned to all com￾mercial pigments (and other colorants) and describes the colorant class (pigment),
color and serial number. Furthermore, the so-called constitution number provides in￾formation about the chemical structure of a colorant. About 27,000 individual prod￾ucts are listed today [1].
Pigments can be based on inorganic or organic chemistry [2]. Representatives of
inorganic pigments include titanium dioxide (white), zinc sulfide (white), ultramarine
(blue), chromium oxide (green), cobalt titanate (green), iron oxides (yellow, red,
brown, black), cerium sulfide (red), lead molybdate (orange), bismuth vanadate (yel￾low) or cobalt-spinel (blue). Titanium dioxide (TiO2) accounts for the largest volume of
pigments, with about a 60% market share. The high refractive index of TiO2 provides
6.2 Pigments 75high light reflection, a high degree of whiteness and opacity. TiO2 exists in the poly￾morphic forms of rutile and anatase; the rutile form protects the polymer from UV
degradation to a higher degree than anatase. Another UV-protecting pigment for poly￾mers is carbon black, which often provides grey and black shades at comparatively
lower cost.
Many different chemical structures are used in the field of organic pigments. Im￾portant classes suitable for plastics processing include structures from Azo pigments
(yellow, orange, red, brown); Benzimidazolone (yellow, red, violet); Phthalocyanine
(green, blue); Quinacridone (red, violet); Perinone (orange, red); Perylene (red, or￾ange); Pyranthrone (orange, red); Indanthrone (blue); Anthanthrone (red); Dioxazine
(violet); Diketopyrrolopyrrole (red, orange) and Chinophthalone (yellow) (Figure 6.4).
In the group of organic pigments, the same chemical class can provide distinct colors
owing to a modified substitution pattern of the basic molecular core element. Al￾though there are many different chemical structures for yellow, orange, red, brown
or even violet colors, the chemistries for green or blue colors are very limited. Com￾pared to inorganic pigments, the temperature stability of organic pigments is often
lower and has to be taken into consideration during plastic processing.
Another class of organic dyes and pigments are fluorescent substances that emit
part of the absorbed light in the UV and visible spectrum and provide very brilliant
colors (see also optical brighteners, Section 6.3) [3, 4]. Phosphorescent additives provide
time-extended light emission (“afterglow”); for example, rare earth doped strontium
aluminate shows phosphorescence with high intensities and extended afterglow dura￾tion, e.g., used in safety signalization [5]. In addition to standard organic or inorganic
pigments, the so-called effect pigments based on, e.g., aluminum platelets, interference
pigments or pearlescent pigments formulated on metal oxides are increasingly used to
add color effects that are not accessible through simple pigments [6]. Examples of sol￾vent dyes used in plastics are azo compounds, anthraquinones and nigrosine blacks. In
addition, colorants from natural resources, e.g., dyes from plants or pigments from min￾erals, may be of future importance [7].
Selection criteria for suitable pigments independent of the color include dispersi￾bility, particle size, particle size distribution, surface area, hardness, abrasiveness, sta￾bility to heat, light and weathering. Standard pigment performance tests include, for
example, pigment discoloration under heat (EN 12877), light fastness (ISO 105) and ar￾tificial weathering (ISO 4892).
Dispersing pigments in the polymer matrix is supported by adding dispersion
agents, which increase color yield while reducing cost. Moreover, pigment formula￾tions are distributed as masterbatches or concentrates, and predispersion facilitates
the dispersion process in the final application. Pigments may influence the rheological
properties of the polymer melt similar to fillers and the crystallization behavior of
partially crystalline polymers by nucleation, which can result, e.g., in the warping of
injection-molded parts. In addition, interactions of pigments with other additives, e.g.,

6.3 Optical brighteners
Although the main application fields of optical brighteners (or fluorescent whitening
agents) are detergents, paper making and textiles, the potential of improving and re￾freshing color is also important for plastics [1, 2]. The inherent yellowness of some poly￾mers or discoloration through aging is masked by adding optical brighteners. Optical
brighteners are often used in combination with dyes or pigments to create a more bril￾liant appearance and to increase reflectance. Light in the UV-A range is absorbed, rais￾ing the energy level from the ground state to the excited state. By returning to the
ground state, energy is released as fluorescence in the blue region. Chemical structures
must withstand polymer processing temperatures up to 300 °C, e.g., for polyester fibers,
which limits the choice mainly to benzoxazole (e.g., 1533-45-5) and stilbene derivatives
(e.g., 40470-68-6). Coumarone derivatives (e.g., 91-44-1) have also been proposed (Fig￾ure 6.5). Polymers where optical brighteners are used include polyesters, polyamides,
PP, PE and PVC.
The performance of optical brighteners is determined by color measurements, e.g.,
the yellowness index (ASTM E 313). The concentration of optical brighteners in plastic
products is between 50 and 200 ppm; therefore, the masterbatches are the preferred
method of addition. For plasticized PVC, the optical brightener (e.g., bis-benzoxazolyl
thiophene (7128-64-5)) may be solved in the plasticizer. As optical brighteners are used
in packaging films, migration into the packaged goods might be an area of concern, de￾pending on the structure [3].

of polymers
7.1 Hydrophobization/hydrophilization
There are a number of additives that modify the surface characteristics of shaped
plastic parts, and they range from lubricants, processing aids and plasticizers to anti￾static, slip and antifogging agents. Surface-active additives are also capable of chang￾ing the polarity of a polymer; for example, a hydrophilic surface-active agent can
generate a hydrophilic surface on a hydrophobic polymer like a polyolefin. However,
additives are only a small part of surface modifications of plastics [1].
The reasons to make a polymer hydrophobic include providing water repellency,
reducing degradation initiated by water, enabling easy or self-cleaning and reducing
the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi or algae. Other aspects include
antigraffiti properties and increasing resistance to oil, solvents and chemicals.
By adding hydrophobic additives, the surface energy of the polymer decreases,
which is measured, by the water contact angle. To make a nonpolar hydrophobic poly￾mer even more hydrophobic, silicone and/or fluorine chemistry can be used. Fluorine￾containing waxes [2] and oligo- and polymeric polycarbonates (PCs) with siloxane [3] or
fluorocarbon [4] end-functionalized groups or polystyrene with fluorocarbon groups [5]
have been proposed for this purpose. As fluorine-containing materials are scrutinized,
there is a trend toward silicones. For example, the hydrophobicity of polybutylene tere￾phthalate (PBT) [6] and polylactic acid (PLA) [7] can be improved by using alkoxysilanes
by end group coupling in a reactive extrusion process.
A polymer needs to be hydrophilic (increased surface energy) so as to increase
the water uptake in the area of synthetic fibers, textiles and nonwovens. Another ap￾plication includes improved adhesion to polar substrates. The strategy for achieving
hydrophilicity is to incorporate polar molecules or hydrophilic oligomers or polymers.
For example, the hydrophilicity of polyesters (PET) is enhanced by adding polyethylene
glycol [8], whereas the surface effect is increased by further adding polystyrene. Other
additives claiming improved wettability of polyesters include alkyloxalkyl sulfonates
[9]. To increase water uptake of polyolefins PP or PE, as required in wipes and hygiene
applications, the strategy involves combining polar blocks with olefin units, e.g., amphi￾philic reaction products of polyethylene glycol with long-chain alcohols or acids [10–12].
Hydroxy-terminated dendrimers have been proposed to increase the surface energy of
PCs [13]. By adding additives in the range 1–5%, water absorption can take place within
seconds, where the water uptake capacity is a multiple of the added weight [14].
All surface effects depend on the structure of the additive (hydrophilic/hydropho￾bic ratio), the durability of the effect and the processing conditions such as shear dur￾ing melt extrusion, as surface enrichment is essential. At the same time, migration to
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110986358-007the surface involves the risk of environmental contamination. Furthermore, all sur￾face-active additives may influence other properties, such as weldability.

References 817.2 Antifogging agents
Similar to hydrophilic surface modifiers, antifogging agents target specific application
areas such as greenhouse films and food packaging. However, additives play a small
function when compared to antifog activities in coatings and technical applications
such as aerospace [1]. These additives help to avoid the formation of water droplets
on polymer films resulting due to the temperature difference. In greenhouse/agricul￾ture films, water droplets reduce light transmission, cause water drops on the plants
and burn leaves owing to the lens effect. In food packaging, water droplets influence
the esthetics of packaged food. The surface-migrating antifogging agent provides hy￾drophilicity to the polymer and also increases the surface energy. Instead of water
droplets, a continuous transparent water film is formed. Antifogging additives are
often based on glycerol esters such as glycerol monosterate (123-84-4) or glycerol
monooleate (25496-72-4); sorbitan esters such as sorbitan monooleate (1338-43-8) or
sorbitan monopalmitate (5050-91-9); fatty esters of amino alcohols such as 2-[(2-
hydroxyethyl)octadecylamino]ethyl stearate (52497-24-2); polyethylene glycol deriva￾tives such as polyethylene glycol monostearate (9004-99-3) and ethoxylated alcohol es￾ters of natural oils such as castor oil or coconut oil (Figure 7.1). Commercial products
are often mixtures of different substitution patterns [2]. Concentrations range be￾tween 0.5% and 4%. As surface migration is essential for the mechanism, environmen￾tal contamination is a potential risk, although largely products of natural origin are
used. Products with higher molecular weight show more durability; however, migra￾tion will be slower and the antifog properties can be delayed. Other approaches
achieve a more permanent effect by grafting reactions and chemical bonding to PE [3]
or silica particles [4].

7.3 Antiblock/slip agents
Often, polymer films show a tendency to stick together, which makes it difficult to
separate individual films during processing steps, such as for packaging applications.
Slip agents are related to lubricants and are represented by amide waxes. Eruca￾mide (112-84-5), oleic acid amide (301-02-0) and behenamide (3061-75-4) are typical
products (Figure 7.2). Through the migration of the slip agent to the film surface, a
lubricating layer is formed that facilitates the separation of adjacent films. The func￾tion as a slip agent is evaluated by measuring the coefficient of friction while separat￾ing the two polymer films from each other (ASTM D-1894).
Antiblocking agents achieve a similar target; however, they are based on inorganic
materials, e.g., silica, talc and zeolites. Concentrations of slip or antiblocking agents
are in the range of 0.1–0.3%.

Most polymers are insulators with high surface resistivity (>1014 Ohms); however,
they can build-up high electrostatic charges. Static electricity may cause the risk of
electrical discharges during handling processes, e.g., through friction and dust con￾tamination. Antistatic agents dissipate electrostatic charges and thus increase safety
and esthetics. Antistatic agents include surface-active molecules that promote the hy￾drophilization of the surface of a plastic part and are therefore related to hydrophili￾zation and antifogging agents. Examples of suitable antistatic agents are glycerol
monostearate (31566-31-1, Figure 7.1), ethoxylated alkylamines, ethoxylated alcohols,
alcohol amides such as N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) dodecanamide (120-40-1), alkyl phos￾phates, ammonium salts (3758-54-1) or alkyl sulfonates (68037-49-0) (Figure 7.3). Ionic
liquids are a more recently investigated additive class, providing antistatic properties
in polymers [1]. The surface-active organic antistats migrate to the surface of the plas￾tic part and pick-up water from the surrounding environment, thus creating a con￾ductive pathway that lowers the surface resistivity by several orders of magnitude
(1010–1012 Ohms). However, the achieved effect depends on the relative humidity and
may not be permanent, as a loss of the active substance from the surface cannot be
excluded.
Alternatively, the entire plastic part can be made more conductive. Examples are
block copolymer elastomers such as poly(ether-block-amides) [2] or polymers with ion
conductivity [3], where functional groups such as quaternary amines [4] or borate
complexes [5] are incorporated. These additives form a permanent conductive inter￾penetrating network in the host polymer matrix, thus dissipating electrical charges
independently of water uptake and achieving a volume resistivity below 1010 Ohms.
Finally, electrically conductive fillers provide a permanent antistatic finish. Typi￾cal representatives include carbon black (1333-86-4), graphene (7782-42-5), carbon
nanotubes (308068-56-6), carbon nanofibers (308063-67-4) [6, 7], metal powders such
as copper and conductive polymers, e.g., polyaniline (25233-30-1), polypyrrole (30604-
81-0) and polythiophene (25233-34-5). Resistivities of 101 Ohms or even lower can be
achieved. In addition to their activity as antistatic agents, these molecules can be used
as components for electromagnetic shielding (EMI). Despite their high efficiency,

color is of importance.
Antistatic agents are used in packaging applications such as for electronic materials
to avoid electrical discharge and in appliances to avoid dust uptake. Common antistatic
polymer classes are polyolefins, polystyrenics such as ABS, as well as PC and polymethyl
methacrylate. Concentrations of antistatic agents vary from 0.1% to 15% depending on
the chemistry used, the required performance and the required permanency.

7.5 Matting and gloss agents
Matt or glossy visual impressions depend on the surface of the plastic article either
through reflectance of light or through light diffusion. Reflectance and gloss are in￾creased by a mirror-like surface without any defects. On the other hand, the matting
is caused by surface roughness. Additives that provide a matt surface are mainly used
in coatings and fibers, and they are called “delustering agents”. In PET and PA fibers,
titanium dioxide is used, where the degree of matting depends on the concentration
and can be above 1% loading [1]. Matting or antigloss agents reported for plastic parts
consist of a wide range of chemistries as the target is to generate surface defects and
increase surface roughness. Therefore, it ranges from the incorporation of fillers to
incompatible rubbers and polymers. For example, functionalized polyolefins, e.g.,
7.5 Matting and gloss agents 85maleic anhydride-grafted polyethylene or polypropylene, can reduce gloss in polyole￾fins [2]. Other additives proposed to achieve a matt plastic surface are surface￾modified silica [3] and melamine derivatives [4]. Especially for automotive applica￾tions or fibers, a mat surface is preferred.
The gloss of the plastic part is often determined by the polymer itself, its micro￾structure, processing equipment and reflecting pigments. Apart from the latter, specific
additives to enhance the gloss of plastics are hardly known, and only combinations of
epoxides and substituted imidazolidinones in PVC or recycled polyolefins [5] were de￾scribed. In polyamides, antinucleating agents, e.g., nigrosine (8005-03-6) or nigrosine
combinations with metal salts, delay the crystallization rate and thus improve surface
gloss [6, 7].

7.6 Antiscratch additives
To maintain the visual appearance, surface durability and value of plastic parts, the im￾pact of scratches should be minimized. To make the surface more resistant to scratches,
hard coatings are a potential solution. To achieve a harder surface through additives,
high loadings of fillers, such as silica (7631-86-9), are required (>10%) preferably in
nanoscale dimensions [1]. Another way to reduce the visibility of small scratches is the
addition of surface-active molecules (“antiscratch additives”). Applications include
molded-in-color interior automotive parts, such as instrument panels or appliances. Ef￾ficient additives for polyolefins consist of fatty acid amides, such as stearyl erucamide
86 7 Additives to adjust surface properties of polymers(96810-35-4) or oleyl palmitamide (96674-02-1), often in combination with maleic acid
ester-modified polyolefins to avoid stickiness (Figure 7.4) [2, 3].
Another class of antiscratch additives is poly(organo) siloxanes, e.g., polydimethyl
siloxanes, with long-chain side groups [4, 5]. Permanence, nonstick surface, no bloom￾ing, low volatiles and no change in surface gloss over time are important criteria. The
concentration range of antiscratch additives is between 1% and 5% for polyolefins.
Maintaining transparency is another criterion in PMMA and PC, whereas polysilox￾anes or anhydrous borax (1330-86-2) perform well [6]. Scratch resistance of PET can
be improved by using internal lubricants such as long-chain esters of long-chain
acids, e.g., palmityl palmitate (540-10-3) [7]. The scratch resistance is determined, for
example, by the resulting damage to a plastic surface when a scratch tip with a spe￾cific load and speed is moved over the plastic part (ISO 19252).

References 878 Specialty additives
The chapter on specialty additives combines low-volume additives that are used only
for a few polymer classes (e.g., aldehyde or formaldehyde scavengers) or particular
applications such as foams, smart additives incorporated in plastics to influence pack￾aged goods, plant growth or heat management.
8.1 Acetaldehyde scavengers
One of the more exclusive application fields of aldehyde scavengers is polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), specifically in water bottles manufactured from PET. During any
thermal processing step of PET, acetaldehyde is formed by an elimination reaction
from the ethylene glycol end groups of the polymer. Although the concentrations are
extremely low, the taste of bottled water will be influenced. The formation of acetalde￾hyde can hardly be suppressed at the polyester manufacturing stage by additives or en￾gineering at the bottle manufacturing site. Therefore, acetaldehyde scavengers are
added to the resin. Acetaldehyde scavengers may react with the formed acetaldehyde
to create nonvolatile products or bind acetaldehyde in a cage structure [1]. Nitrogen￾containing compounds such as amines (e.g., m-xylylene diamine (1477-55-0), Figure 8.1)),
anthranilamide (88-68-6), hydroxylamines or nitrones [2], polyols including polyvinyl al￾cohol [3] as well as polyamides and polyacrylamides (9003-05-8) have been reported to
function as active acetaldehyde scavengers. Zeolites and cyclodextrins are representa￾tives of the second class, forming a cage. Anthranilamide seems to be one of the pre￾ferred molecules; however, the migration of low-molecular-weight scavengers can be
an issue [4]; thus, concentrations are of only 0.05%.

8.2 Formaldehyde scavengers
Thermal degradation of polyoxymethylene and polyacetals results in the formation of
formaldehyde, which is further catalyzed by the oxidation of formaldehyde to form
formic acid. Thermosets based on formaldehyde, such as phenol-formaldehyde or
melamine-formaldehyde resins, may also release traces of formaldehyde. To reduce
formaldehyde formation during the processing of polyacetals, antioxidants and acid
scavengers are helpful [1]. Formaldehyde scavengers are nitrogen compounds, e.g.,
melamine derivatives such as benzoguanamine ((91-76-9), Figure 8.2), urea derivatives
such as allantoin (97-59-6), acetoacetamide (5977-14-0) and its derivatives, guanidines,
hydrazides, sulfonamides and others. Sodium sulfite was found to be efficient in phe￾nol-formaldehyde resins [2]; concentrations have to be in the percentage range.

8.3 Odor scavenging and reduction of volatiles
Volatiles and odor formation limit the potential applications of plastics and are a rea￾son for undesirable emissions. Volatiles may arise from polymer synthesis through
by-products, solvent residues, low-molecular-weight oligomers or degradation prod￾ucts from thermal processing. Recycled plastics often suffer from contaminations, e.g.,
oils and fats from packaged goods, printing inks, detergents, perfumes and other sub￾stances as well as their degradation products. Clean synthesis of virgin polymers and
sufficient purification steps of recyclates are prerequisites for odor and volatile reduc￾tion. Degassing processes during compounding contribute to low volatile and odor
values [1, 2]. In addition, the selected additives reduce volatile and odor, potentially in
a permanent manner. In general, processing stabilizers are needed to avoid degrada￾tion. Functional molecules react with volatile or odorous substances, forming chemi￾cal bonds or strong complexes. Thus, the critical molecules are transferred into a
nonvolatile product of higher molecular weight remaining in the polymer. Examples
of such additives include the zinc salt of ricinoleic acid ((13040-19-2), Figure 8.3) [3],
metal ionomers [4] and epoxides [5]. An alternative method to reduce odors or vola￾tiles in polymers is the addition of inorganic or organic adsorbents. Examples of ad￾sorbents are silicates such as zeolites [6] or cyclodextrins [7]. Adsorbents do not form

occur again under heat or by extraction. A combination of both approaches, function￾ality and adsorption, is followed by using amine-functionalized silica [8]. In general,
there is no universal process or additive to manage all kinds of odors and volatiles,
and the best method has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
Instead of being scavenged, odor may be masked by fragrance-releasing agents,
e.g., with fruit or flower scent.

8.4 Thermally conductive additives
Thermally conductive compounds are mainly used in the electronics industry to dissi￾pate heat, i.e., to remove heat from electronic components. Commercial additive clas￾ses used in plastics in the form of fillers are ceramics, carbon-based materials or
metals [1, 2]. Carbon-based additives include graphite (7782-42-5), carbon fibers (7440-
44-0), carbon nanotubes (308068-56-6) or graphene (7782-42-5). Metals in the form of
fibers or powder are based on copper, aluminum or silver. However, carbon and
metal components simultaneously increase electrical conductivity, which may not be
desired. Therefore, the fillers of choice are often ceramics, e.g., aluminum nitride
(24304-00-5), boron nitride (10043-11-5) or silicon carbide (409-21-2), where the low
8.4 Thermally conductive additives 91thermal conductivity of thermoplastics about 0.1–0.3 W/mK is increased by a factor of
10–100. Some minerals, such as alumosilicates or aluminum oxides result, in a slightly
smaller increase in heat conductivity. To obtain a thermally conductive pathway in
the composite, high concentrations are required and can be in the 50% weight range,
where all challenges of highly filled composites are important, such as processability,
filler dispersion, filler surface modification and inferior mechanical properties. Be￾cause of the increasing miniaturization of electronic parts, a larger range of thermally
conductive compounds and new developments can be expected.

8.5 Color-changing additives
Stimuli-responsive additives that change color due to an external trigger cover thermo￾chromic (temperature influence), photochromic (light influence) and mechanochromic
(mechanical or impact influence) elements. The color change can be permanent or re￾versible. A permanent change is, e.g., required in laser-marking processes or as time
temperature indicators. In laser-marking additives, inorganic oxides are used, such as
on the basis of tin oxides or iron oxides [1]. Thermochromic and photochromic materials
are often dyes [2, 3], e.g., derivatives of Rhodamine B ((81-88-9), Figure 8.4). Irreversible
mechanochromic additives to indicate part damage can be realized by encapsulated
dyes where the dye is freed by the mechanical impact [4].

8.6 Biocides/antimicrobials
Although most polymers are slowly attacked by microorganisms like bacteria, fungi,
yeasts, mold and algae, there are application areas where antimicrobials or biocides
must protect the plastics for hygienic reasons. Staining, unpleasant odor and loss of es￾thetics can be consequences of microorganisms on the surface of a plastic part. Poten￾tial fields include outdoor applications in public areas (e.g., wood-plastic composites,
liners for pools, bath mats and appliances) and household and consumer applications
such as kitchen utensils, textiles and medical devices [1, 2]. Biocides must act at the plas￾tic surface and comprise organic surface-migrating molecules or inorganic material￾releasing metal ions from silver, copper or zinc. Examples of organic biocides are 10,10′-
oxybisphenoxarsine ((58-36-6), Figure 8.5), 2 n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (26530-20-1) and
zinc pyrithione (13463-41-7), which are used in plasticized PVC, polyurethane foam and
thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO). Other organic additives include 2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-
hydroxy-diphenylether ((3380-34-5) Triclosan [3]) and quaternary ammonium salts, e.g.,
polysiloxanes with functional ammonium groups [4].

8.6 Biocides/antimicrobials 93Because of environmental concerns with organic antimicrobials, silver-based prod￾ucts have become increasingly preferred. Silver ion-releasing antimicrobial com￾pounds cover silver salts, colloidal silver, nanosilver and silver complexes, such as Ag
zeolite, sometimes in combination with Zn, and silver glasses [5]. Moreover, there is a
trend to use nanoparticles of silver and other metals for enhanced antimicrobial ac￾tivity [6]. Another approach to cope with environmental risks is to use the biocidal
effect of plant extracts [7, 8] or natural polymers like chitosan (9012-76-4) [9], espe￾cially in food packaging. Controlled release to maintain the concentration of the addi￾tive at a certain efficiency level, to extend the use time and to ensure permanency is
another developmental topic for antimicrobials. Use concentrations of antimicrobials
are in the range of 0.2–2%.

8.7 Infrared-active additives
Infrared absorbers and reflectors are used to limit heat development in buildings and
therefore contribute to energy savings. In greenhouses, infrared-active additives are
incorporated into agricultural films or glazing to control heat. Typical materials range
from metal oxides, e.g., titanium dioxide (13463-67-7), kaolinite (aluminum silicate,
(1318-74-7)) or other silicates and hydrotalcites [1] in agricultural films to dyes, e.g.,
phthalocyanines [2] or anthraquinones. The color range of infrared reflectors is from
94 8 Specialty additiveswhite, e.g., titanium dioxide (13463-67-7) or zinc oxide (1314-13-2), to black [3], and the
effect varies from light scattering up to total reflectance. Furthermore, dyes with
near-infrared absorption are added to enhance the laser welding of polymers.

8.8 Adhesion promoters
Adhesion promoters are primarily used in coatings (in the form of solutions or suspen￾sions) to achieve good adhesion of the coating to substrates, such as metals. Although
surface treatments of plastics through flame, plasma, chemical treatment or primers to
generate chemical groups to enhance adhesion, such as paints, are quite common, func￾tional additives incorporated in the polymer are an alternative. However, migration of
the additive to the surface to provide sufficient functionality is a prerequisite. Chemical
structures consist of block copolymers with functional groups and chain structures sim￾ilar to the polymer of choice [1]. The polymer structures of adhesion promoters are re￾lated to compatibilizers and coupling agents. Functional groups of the polymer are, for
example, maleic anhydride or methacrylic acid type [2].

8.9 Blowing/foaming/antifoaming agents
Blowing agents are essential compounds in the manufacture of polymer foams [1, 2].
Physical blowing agents are gases injected during the foaming, such as CO2 or low￾8.9 Blowing/foaming/antifoaming agents 95boiling alkanes (e.g., pentane). The latter is used, for example, in expanded polysty￾rene (EPS) production. Chemical blowing agents, which decompose thermally in the
foam production process, release gases and create the foamed structure. The decom￾position temperature of the blowing agent determines the polymer application, as it
must be within the processing range of the individual polymer. Chemical blowing
agents can be of an inorganic or organic nature. An example of an inorganic blowing
agent is the system monosodium citrate (18996-35-5) and sodium hydrogen carbonate
(144-55-8), which decomposes at 150–200 °C and forms CO2 and water.
Organic blowing agents comprise azo compounds, such as azodicarbonamide
((123-77-3), decomposition at 205–215 °C, Figure 8.6), which form N2 and CO. Hydra￾zides such as trihydrazino triazine ((10105-42-7), decomposition at 275 °C, formation of
N2 and NH3) or 4,4ʹ-oxybis (benzenesulfonyl hydrazide ((80-51-3), decomposition at
150–160 °C, formation of N2), azides such as p-toluenesulfonyl semicarbazide ((10396-
10-8) decomposition at 190–220 °C, formation mainly of N2 and CO2) or tetrazoles such
as 5-phenyltetrazole ((18039-42-4), decomposition at 240–280 °C, formation of N2) are
also used. The reaction of isocyanates and water, resulting in CO2 formation, is used
in the manufacturing of polyurethane foams. There have been toxicological concerns
with the most commonly used organic blowing agent, azodicarbonamide; however, a
potent replacement has not been introduced so far [3].
Selection criteria, besides the decomposition temperature – which has to be within
the processing range of the polymer – include the compatibility and dispersion of the
foaming agent in the polymer matrix as well as access to selected foam structures
(closed, open cells, porous, cell size). The foam structure is further influenced by the
foaming process, cell-nucleating agents, surfactants, foam stabilizers (e.g., chain ex￾tenders) and cross-linking agents. To manufacture microcellular foams with small cell
sizes and high cell density, nucleating agents such as talc or nanoclays have been pro￾posed [4]. As foams are a way to create lightweight structures and provide thermal

8.10 Animal repellents
When plastic applications such as cables or pipes are installed openly, there is a risk
of damage from animals (e.g., rodents or insects). Therefore, additives may be incor￾porated to eliminate or reduce potential deterioration of the plastic applications. Ad￾ditives of choice to repel rodents are substances with a bitter taste, e.g., denatonium
benzoate ((3734-33-6), Figure 8.7) and/or a spicy taste, e.g., capsaicin ((404-86-4), hot
pepper), and/or an unpleasant odor for animals [1]. Other substances that repel rodents,
cats, dogs and birds include natural oils like menthol (2216-51-5) or methyl salicylate
(119-36-8) [2, 3].

8.11 Electrically conductive additives
Electrically conductive additives for polymers comprise a broad range of filler-type ma￾terials, starting from providing antistatic behavior (see Section 7.4) and comparatively
low conductivity (1010–1012 Ohms/cm) up to electrically conductive polymers with elec￾trical conductivity close to metals, used, e.g., for electromagnetic shielding (101
–104
Ohms/cm) [1]. Polymer composites of high conductivity can be achieved not only by
high loadings of carbon black (>30%) but also by carbon fibers (7440-44-0), carbon nano￾tubes (308068-56-6) or graphene (7782-42-5), metal fibers and metal-coated fibers. The
preparation challenge is the dispersion of the additives to achieve a conductive path￾way at optimized loadings and acceptable auxiliary properties. Nickel-coated carbon
and stainless-steel fibers are used for EMI shielding [2]. Electrically conductive poly￾mers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) ((126213-51-2), PEDOT, Figure 8.8), poly￾pyrrole (30604-81-0) and polyaniline (25233-30-1) may gain importance in the future by
production methods like additive manufacturing [3].

8.13 Oxygen scavengers
As packaged foods like meat and cheese as well as liquids like oils and juices are sen￾sitive to oxygen, oxygen scavengers are introduced into plastic packaging to remove
oxygen residues, extend shelf life, freshness and prevent vitamin losses. The packaged
goods are protected from oxidation and undesirable taste, odor or appearance caused
by oxidation. Oxygen scavengers comprise systems based on iron, dienes or photosen￾sitive dyes [1, 2]. Iron-containing oxygen scavengers react with oxygen in moisture to
form iron oxide (Fe2O3). This process can be additionally catalyzed, e.g., with sodium
chloride (7647-14-5) or combined with reducing agents such as ascorbic acid (50-81-7) [3].
Nanosized iron particles seem to be beneficial for efficiency. Alternative oxygen scaven￾ger products include polybutadiene or its copolymers with cyclohexene or with allylic
groups in combination with transition metal catalysts based on cobalt or zinc, e.g., cobalt
acetate (71-48-7), zinc acetate (557-34-6) or photocatalytic initiation [4]. Photosensitive
dyes such as eosin (17372-87-1) or curcumin (458-37-7) activate oxygen to the singlet state
through UV light, which then reacts with an oxidizable substance [5].

8.14 Smart food packaging additives (content protection)
In addition to commonly used oxygen scavengers, further additives are applied in plastic
packaging to protect the quality of packaged food and extend shelf-life. These so-called
active packaging systems include UV absorbers, antioxidants, moisture absorbers, car￾bon dioxide emitters/absorbers, ethylene absorbers, ethanol emitters, flavor releasing/
absorbing systems, barrier materials as well as time–temperature indicators and even
antimicrobials [1–4].
UV absorbers protect food from discoloration and prevent the degradation of food
ingredients, e.g., vitamins, thereby extending shelf life. These UV absorbers are based on
the same chemical classes used for protecting plastics, as described earlier (Section 3.2).
Antioxidants are incorporated to be slowly released into the food to avoid, for ex￾ample, the oxidation of oils and fats. Natural antioxidants, such as vitamin E ((10191-
41-0) Tocopherol), Thymol (89-83-8), Eugenol (97-53-0), Carvacrol (499-75-2) [5], or ex￾tracts from green tea or rosemary are proposed. Essential oils containing antioxidants
also show antimicrobial activity. Other antimicrobial active packaging ingredients in￾clude chitosan (9012-76-4), nanoclays, enzymes and organic acids. Ethanol-releasing
agents can be used for the same purpose.
Ethylene accelerates the ripening of fruits if it accumulates inside the plastic
packaging, thus decreasing shelf life. A potential solution is the incorporation of potas￾sium permanganate silica, where silica absorbs ethylene and permanganate oxidizes
it finally to CO2 and H2O [6]. Alternative technologies are based on minerals such as
zeolites or clays.
Carbon dioxide may be produced inside a package through food degradation and
may influence the quality of fruits and vegetables. Carbon dioxide scavengers, e.g.,
calcium hydroxide (1305-62-0), reacting to form calcium carbonate (471-34-1) are po￾tential solutions. On the other hand, CO2 reduces bacterial growth in the packaging.
100 8 Specialty additivesTherefore, CO2-generating additives, e.g., ferrous carbonate (463-79-6), or the system
of sodium bicarbonate (144-55-8) and citric acid (77-92-9) are used. The combination of
sodium bicarbonate and ascorbic acid (50-81-7) shows a dual activity as a CO2 emitter
and oxygen scavenger.
Moisture absorbers are used, for example, in the packaging of dried food to control
humidity. Desiccants such as silica, clays and zeolites are commonly used, primarily as
sachets. Nanoclays may combine moisture barrier properties and can be combined
with releasing agents [7].
Another class of additives in food packaging includes color indicators, such as
time–temperature indicators, to guarantee freshness, ensure an unbroken seal or
prove sterilization.

8.15 Smart additives to enhance productivity of plants
The productivity of greenhouses by accelerating the growth of plants while suppressing
some potential plant diseases caused by pests and fungi may be enhanced through
greenhouse films with adjusted additives. These additives modify the spectrum of out￾side solar radiation and convert UV light into red or blue light. Blue light (400–500 nm)
is important for early growth, whereas red light (600–700 nm) is essential for photosyn￾thesis [1]. The solar spectrum can be controlled by the incorporation of fluorescent dyes
or pigments in the typical greenhouse or agricultural film based on polyethylene or
8.15 Smart additives to enhance productivity of plants 101multilayers. For example, the condensation product of dialkylamine benzaldehyde and
barbituric acid [2] absorbs in the near UV range and shows a reddish color with maxi￾mum emission at 635 nm. Other photoluminescent pigments include rare earth ele￾ments, such as europium [3]. The changes in the radiation transmission can result in
significant modification of plant architecture and shape, e.g., yields of tomato fruits and
the number of flowers, like roses, were significantly increased when a film with a red
fluorescent dye was used in the greenhouse [4]. To improve the long-term and UV sta￾bility of the incorporated dye, protection through efficient UV absorbers [2] or encapsu￾lation [5] is beneficial.

8.16 Markers
Identifying and tracing the origin of a polymer (and also of additives) has been a
point of interest for polymer manufacturers to differentiate their products from those
of other suppliers, e.g., in the case of identifying the cause of damage or for counter￾feiting purposes. In the growing area of recycling, identification to separate different
polymers is of increasing importance. Easily detectable markers or tracers are incor￾porated into the polymer in the ppm range to fulfill these requirements. Additives of
choice may be fluorescent dyes [1, 2], combinations of rare earth metals [3] or even
hapten compounds [4]. More recently, inorganic fluorescents based on oxides with
rare earth dopants have been introduced [5, 6]. With marker concentrations in the
range of 10 ppm, individual polymers and sources can be identified by fluorescence
spectroscopy. Standard black materials containing, e.g., carbon black as nonreflecting
parts are still challenging to identify in the presence of markers. Therefore, for im￾proved sorting of black plastics, reflecting black pigments based on copper aluminum
oxides [7] or vanadates [8] can be a solution.
