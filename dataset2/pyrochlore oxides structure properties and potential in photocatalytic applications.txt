Complex metal oxides as a class of inorganic compounds are of great interest for 
research due to their various practically important properties: piezoelectric, catalytic, 
optical, ionic and electronic conductivity, which makes them promising materials 
for use as capacitors, superconductors, semiconductors, in piezoelectric devices, etc. 
[1–3]. Among such complex oxides are distinguished several most representative 
series of compounds based on stable structural types of minerals: perovskite, fluorite, 
pyrochlore, corundum, rutile, etc. The crystal structure of such compounds is built 
from a polyhedral metal-oxygen framework, in the cavities of which low-charge 
cations are located. Thus, researchers, by changing the elemental composition while 
maintaining the general crystal structure, control various useful physical properties 
of compounds. 
There are a significant number of review works on compounds of the listed struc￾tural types; however, the majority of them are devoted to a perovskite structure. At the 
same time, no less scientific interest is represented by the structural type of the mineral 
pyrochlore (Ca,Na)2Nb2O6F [4]. The structure of the ideal α-pyrochlore has stoi￾chiometry AM2X6X’ (A—large low-charge cation, M—small high-charge cation, 
X—ions O2– and OH–, F–, or H2O molecules, X’—weakly bound ions). When the 
number of X’ anions decreases, defective α-pyrochlores are formed with the general 
formula A2–xB2X6X’1–y. The last member of this series is called β-pyrochlore with 
the general formula AB2X6. 
Active research of these compounds began around the 1970s. In a review paper [5] 
from 1983, the structure and properties of α-pyrochlores A 2 
3+M2 
4+O7, A2 
2+M2 
5+O7 
and A2M2O6 are discussed in detail, while there is almost no information about a 
series of structures AM2O6, although the question related to their symmetry features 
remains open. It is generally considered that the structure of oxygen-containing β￾pyrochlore is mainly characterized by cubic symmetry, but recently there have been 
studies showing the possibility of their crystallization in other symmetries. 
In modern review papers, there is also almost no information about the synthesis 
and structural features of β-pyrochlores, and the topics of discussion are magnetic￾spin effects and photocatalytic properties [6–8], changes in the structure A 2M2O7 
under high pressure and radiation conditions [9], the possibility of using compounds
vvi Preface
A2M2O7 for immobilization of actinides [10], as well as structural interrelationships 
between fluorite and pyrochlore types [11]. It is partly due to the fact that the M 
position can be occupied by transition metals with a variable oxidation state, and in the 
A position can be rare earth elements (Ln) or elements with lone electron pair. Thus, 
the electrical properties of pyrochlores vary widely from dielectric to semiconductor 
and even metallic conductivity, in addition, in some cases, superconductivity has 
been found. 
Many pyrochlore compounds, which contain elements A and M in the highest 
oxidation state, show interesting dielectric, piezo- and ferroelectric properties. In 
cases where a 3d-transition element is presented in the M position and/or a rare 
earth element is in the A position, magnetic properties are observed ranging from 
simple paramagnetic to ferro- or antiferromagnetic (at 77 K and below). Many of 
the pyrochlores oxide (where X = O2–) are excellent refractory materials. Some 
pyrochlores containing Ln demonstrate fluorescent and phosphorescent properties 
and can be considered as materials for lasers. 
Currently, the topic of photocatalytic water splitting to produce environmentally 
friendly fuel—hydrogen, as well as the decomposition of organic pollutants that 
enter the environment with wastewater or emissions into the atmosphere—attracting 
the attention of scientists around the world. As research shows, some compounds 
with pyrochlore structure exhibit photocatalytic activity and even act as promising 
objects for photocatalysis. For example, the authors [12] showed that water decom￾position is more efficient using cubic pyrochlore AgSbO 3, compared to WO3. In a 
series of complex oxides with various crystal structures from perovskite KTaO 3 to 
pyrochlore K2Ta2O6, the best photocatalytic ability to decompose water is shown by 
the pyrochlore phase due to its optimal electronic structure and particle size. Among 
the phases with the β-pyrochlore structure, photocatalytic water splitting can be 
caused by compounds AI
MVWO6 (AI = K, Rb, Cs; MV = Nb, Ta) [13], and the 
organic compounds decomposition –CsTeMoO6, RbTe1.5W0.5O6, (Rb/Cs)NbTeO6 
[14, 15]. 
In addition, the use of photocatalysis appears attractive for obtaining biomedical 
materials based on natural polymers [16]. The main advantage of such materials is 
the unique combination of properties of their components, assembled into a certain 
structure. One of the most important consumers of such materials is regenerative 
medicine, associated with stimulating cellular/tissue regeneration. It represents a 
new stage in the evolutionary development of medical technologies, emerged at the 
intersection of medicine, biology, physics, chemistry. It allows us to call this branch 
of medicine an interdisciplinary type of scientific-practical activity, using modern 
achievements of each scientific branch. 
The use of the active hydroxyl radical, formed during photocatalysis, for obtaining 
new polymeric materials attracts attention for a number of reasons: the possibility 
of carrying out the process at room temperature, the absence of organic initiators 
fragments and so on. It is well known, that radical polymerization is the most 
convenient way to obtain polymeric materials. Photocatalytic radical polymeriza￾tion at low temperatures with the participation of the active hydroxyl radical is 
best known for titanium oxide [17, 18]. Number of works are devoted to similarPreface vii
studies of obtaining composites for 3D printing of biomedical materials [19], or 
along with controlled copolymerization by the mechanism of reversible chain transfer 
attachment-fragmentation for synthesis of block copolymers of acrylic monomers 
with a certain composition [20]. Despite this, there are not so many works on complex 
oxides compared to research on binary oxides and compositions based on them. 
Another application of photocatalytic materials is related to their antimicrobial and 
antifungal properties. It is known that various industrial materials and products made 
from them under operating conditions and long-term storage can undergo microbi￾ological damage and destruction. The main agents of biodamage are mycelial fungi 
and to a lesser extent bacteria [21–23]. Traditionally in most cases for protection of 
various industrial materials and products made from them (paints, varnishes, poly￾mers, etc.) organic origin biocides are used (aldehydes, alcohols, phenols, nitrogen 
heterocycles, guanidine, etc.) [24, 25]. 
Considering the high adaptive capabilities of microorganisms to the impact of 
various chemical factors, researchers to increase the bio-protection effectiveness of 
industrial materials require to carry out search and implementation of new biocidal 
compounds. It usually entails an increase in economic costs, or the concentrations 
of existing protective means, which can negatively affect the deterioration of tech￾nological characteristics of materials, as well as increase the environmental load on 
the environment during their disposal [26, 27]. 
Recently in the literature metal oxides (such as ZnO, TiO 2, WO3 and others) in the 
form of nano- and microparticles are considered as protection from biodamage due to 
exhibiting antimicrobial properties [28]. Interest in the application of such oxides and 
their modifications is that they destroy biological membranes, disrupt the structure 
and functioning of proteins, DNA, ATP, etc., and can possess photocatalytic activity, 
which enhances their antimicrobial effect. The most widely studied among them 
are nanoparticles of binary oxides WO3, TiO2, Al2O3, ZnO. Their action is based 
on the ability to generate active forms of oxygen (AFO) under the light irradiation, 
which can inhibit the activity of microorganisms [29–31]. The antimicrobial action 
of photocatalytically active microparticles depends on a number of factors: particle 
size, their concentration and morphology, band gap, light source intensity, nature 
of the metals, and type of biological object. According to [32, 33], nanoparticles of 
TiO2, ZnO and other binary oxides, and their photocatalytically active modifications 
are only active in the UV range or close to the visible light. The UV range accounts 
for only about 5–9% in the sunlight spectrum (100–400 nm), while the main intensity 
corresponds to 350–400 nm. Compounds that absorb light with a wavelength of less 
than 400 nm work inefficiently under the sunlight and require a separate radiation 
source at the absorption wavelength. In this regard, it is relevant to search for new 
oxides that exhibit photocatalytic activity under visible light radiation, thus complex 
oxides attract the most attention.viii Preface
Over the past years, a lot of experimental material about preparation conditions 
and the crystal structure of pyrochlore compounds have been obtained. In partic￾ular, the authors of the monograph began studying pyrochlores in 1985, and partic￾ular interest has been attracted to β-pyrochlores. Thus, the authors accumulated the 
extensive material. New representatives of this series have been obtained, their crystal 
structure has been determined, their optical properties have been studied by experi￾mental and quantum-chemical methods, and the results have been published in arti￾cles in leading scientific journals. In addition, the team of authors has been studying 
the photocatalytic activity of synthesized pyrochlore compounds for several years, 
so new results have also been obtained in this direction. The combination of the 
obtained results with known literature data allows a systematic presentation of the 
current state of this topic. Thus, the monograph reviews the current state of available 
information about the compositions, structural features, properties and application 
of compounds—analogs of the mineral pyrochlore, as well as the criteria for the 
stability of this structural type. In addition, the investigations of compounds with a 
β-pyrochlore structure for carrying out radical processes to obtain composites based 
on natural and synthetic polymers, which are of interest for regenerative medicine, 
as well as antimicrobial and antifungal materials, are presented. 
The authors express deep gratitude to the laboratories of high-purity substances 
technology, inorganic materials, petrochemistry and microbiological analysis of the 
Institute of Chemistry, Lobachevsky State University, for their assistance in carrying 
out and writing the works, which allowed a systematic analysis of knowledge about 
pyrochlore compounds and their photocatalytic properties. A number of studies were 
carried out with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education 
of the Russian Federation (state task FSWR-2023-0024) and using the equipment 
of the Collective Usage Center “New Materials and Resource-saving Technologies” 
(Lobachevsky State University, Nizhny Novgorod). The XPS studies were conducted 
at the Resource and Educational Center “Physics of Solid State Nanostructures” 
(Lobachevsky State University, Nizhny Novgorod) and the Resource Center “Phys￾ical Methods of Surface Investigation” (Saint-Petersburg State University). The X￾ray single crystal diffraction analysis was conducted at the Collective Usage Center 
of the Razuvaev Institute of Organometallic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences (Nizhny Novgorod). 
All the editors of this book are earnestly thankful to all our contributors who have 
given their valuable time to write the Chapters of their expertise. Without their contri￾bution, it would have been difficult to accomplish the book, and we are also thankful 
to all the scientists, researchers, students, and teachers who have made significant 
contribution to the development of new materials for photocatalytic applications. We 
would also like to express our deepest gratitude to the Springer Nature editorial team,Preface ix

Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides

1.1 General Characteristics and Features of the Crystal 
Structure 
The structure of the ideal α-pyrochlore with stoichiometry A2M2X6X' (A—large 
low-charge cation of alkali, alkaline earth, or rare earth elements), M—a small high￾charge cation capable of octahedral coordination (p- or d-elements), X—ions O2– 
and OH–, F–, or molecules H2O, X'
—ions weakly bound to M) has a cubic symmetry 
with the space group Fd3m (Z = 8). Due to the wide variety of elemental compo￾sitions of compounds of this structural type, the main objects of description in the 
monograph are oxygen-containing pyrochlores with the general formula A2M2O6O'
. 
The structure contains two types of coordination polyhedra—around atoms in posi￾tions A and M. The cation A is usually characterized by an ionic radius of about 1 Å 
and has eight O atoms in the near environment. Such an environment has the form of 
a scalenohedron (distorted cube). The cation in position M has a smaller size (ionic 
radius about 0.6 Å) and six O atoms in the near coordination sphere, which forms 
a trigonal antiprism (distorted octahedron). Fulfillment conditions for simultaneous 
realization in the structure of pyrochlore of the correct octahedral and cubic envi￾ronment for atoms M and A, respectively, is impossible (Fig. 1.1). In real structures, 
either distortion of one polyhedra or both is observed.
Since there are four non-equivalent atoms in the structure of α-pyrochlore, four 
crystallographic settings are possible for describing coordinates. The most common 
is the description in which the cation M is located at the origin of coordinates. Such 
a structure of α-pyrochlore has only one variable parameter—the coordinate x of the 
O atom, which is refined by X-ray or neutron diffraction methods (Table 1.1). In the

Fig. 1.1 A and M positions in α-pyrochlore structure at x = 0.3125 ([MO6]—ideal octahedron) 
(a) and x = 0.375 ([AO8]—ideal cube) (b)
case of forming a correct octahedral environment for M x equals 0.3125, and in the 
case of cubic for A − x = 0.375. 
There are several approaches to describing the structure of α-pyrochlore, which 
arise due to changes in the shape of coordination polyhedra around cations A and M 
depending on the value of the oxygen parameter x: 
1. Representation based on comparison with the fluorite structure (AO2, cubic, 3m) 
[2, 3]: cations A and M form a face-centered cubic packing, and anions are located 
in the tetrahedral voids of the cationic sublattice (Fig. 1.2).
In the fluorite (CaF2) structure the sublattice of Ca atoms is characterized by face￾centered cubic symmetry, and fluorine atoms are located in tetrahedral positions. 
Cations A and M are ordered in alternating rows [110] in each plane [001]. It leads 
to three types of tetrahedral interstices for anions: positions 48f with two nearest 
neighbors A and two neighbors M, positions 8a with four close neighbors M and 
positions 8b with four close neighbors A. In the α-pyrochlore structure, positions 8a 
are vacant, because the formula unit of α-pyrochlore A2M2O7 corresponds to four 
CaF2. 
The four M atoms adjacent to this anionic vacancy tend to electrostatic shielding 
from each other due to displacements of each anion in position 48f from the center 
of its tetrahedral interstice towards the two neighboring cations M [3]. Anions 48f,

initially located at x = 0.375, shift to position x = 0.3125, where ions M are in 
octahedra sharing vertices along the [110] direction. It increases the M–M–M angle 
along these rows from 109°28' to approximately 132°. Anions 8b (X'
) remain equidis￾tant from the four nearest A cations. These 8b anions together with the 16d cations 
form a sublattice, isostructural to one of the two interpenetrating networks of the 
anticristobalite structure (Cu2O). 
The above description applies only to α-pyrochlores with a value of x around 
0.375 or with a high x value, characterized by compounds having a cation with a 
large ionic radius in the M position (for example, Zr4+). Some of these compounds 
undergo “α-pyrochlore-defective fluorite” phase transition. This type of transition 
never occurs in the α-pyrochlore structure, containing smaller M cations. However, 
for most compounds the value of x lies significantly below this area [5]. 
2. Representation as linked tetrahedra M4 and A4O' (anticristobalite type) [5, 6]: the 
structure consists of two interpenetrating networks of tetrahedra. Four M cations 
occupy the corners of a regular tetrahedron with a void in the center (Fig. 1.3), 
oxygen atoms are outside the M4 tetrahedra, which form a three-dimensional 
sequence, observed in the cristobalite structure SiO2 (space group Fd3m). The 
network formed by the tetrahedra can be designated as M4/2O6; it is pierced by 
a network of A2O'
, resembling the anticristobalite structure Cu2O.
The M cations are located at the intersection of two tetrahedra and are located in 
the center of distorted O octahedra (3m or d3d symmetry). The deformation of the 
octahedra depends on the 48f parameter x: at x = 0.3125 the octahedra are regular, 
while at x /= 0.3125 the octahedra are compressed or stretched along the 3rd order 
axis. 
The above description explains the high symmetry (Fd3m) of the α-pyrochlore 
structure. The rigidity of the structure framework is due to the interpenetration of 
two tetrahedral networks, formed by A and M cations. The A–A and M–M distances, 
equal and constant throughout the structure, do not depend on the parameter x of 
oxygen in 48f. The authors previously [6] listed the advantages of such a description 
of the α-pyrochlore structure: 
(1) The model gives more importance to the 8b position, containing the anion O'
, 
which undergoes sp3-hybridization, and the coordination is a regular tetrahedron 
A4O'
. 
(2) It can be expected that distortions of the general cubic symmetry in the α￾pyrochlore structure will be similar to those observed in various polymorphic 
modifications of SiO2. 
(3) When the 16d position (A cation) is occupied by d10-ions, such as Hg2+, Cd2+, 
Ag+, which often undergo sp3-hybridization, the A–OX' bond is stronger than 
the A–O bond, and an increase in the A–O distance is observed, which gives low 
x values (x ~ 0.3125). If the strength of the A–O' bond is even higher, then the 
regular octahedral environment can expand along the 3rd axis, which will lead 
to a decrease in the x value (x < 0.3125). For instance, in the case of Cd2Re2O7 
[7] x is 0.309, which is lower than for the regular octahedra.1 Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides 5

However, this description is associated with a difficulty, in that it inadequately 
explains the formation of defective pyrochlores of the general formulas of AM2O6 
and A2M2O7–x (is a vacancy). Calculations of the energy structure depending on 
x-parameter of oxygen 48f were carried out in the works [8, 9] in order to obtain a 
general idea of the α-pyrochlore structure stability. These results of semi-quantitative 
calculations generally agree well with experimental observations:6 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
(1) The electrostatic energy of the M2O6 network is always more negative than that 
of the A2O' network, indicating that the former is more stable. 
(2) The interaction energy between grids is only 2–3% of the total electrostatic 
energy of the system. 
(3) For all values of x, the electrostatic energy of pyrochlores with A1+ and M6+ 
is more negative than that of other types with Am+ and Mn+. However, α￾pyrochlores with A1+ and M6+ do not exist due to the absence of cations with 
suitable ionic radii. For values of x close to 0.3125, pyrochlores with A2+ and 
M5+ should be more stable than those with A3+ and M4+ or A4+ and M3+, which, 
indeed, has been established experimentally. 
(4) In the case of α-pyrochlores with A3+ and M4+ the structure is definitely more 
stable at x < 0.36 compared to the defective fluorite structure. For x = 0.36, the 
α-pyrochlore structure can also exist, but it can easily be transformed into the 
defective fluorite structure. For instance, there is a transition from pyrochlore to 
defective fluorite in Ln2Zr2O7, where x increases from La to Gd. The transition 
of α-pyrochlore to defective fluorite in some of these zirconates (La–Gd) also 
occurs depending on the temperature. In the case of α-pyrochlores with A4+ and 
M3+ calculations show that the structure can be stable at x > 0.35 [10]. 
3. Representation of the α-pyrochlore structure as linked structural units M2O6 and 
A2O' (the most commonly used interpretation of the structure) (Fig. 1.4) [6]: in 
the structure of each α-pyrochlore, the M atom is surrounded by six O anions, 
which form an octahedral environment. The MO6 octahedra are connected to 
each other through vertices. Each A cation is surrounded by six O atoms and 
two O' atoms, with the A–O' bond length usually significantly less than A– 
O. Therefore, it is customary to consider the structure as a three-dimensional 
octahedral M2O6 framework, through which the A2O' channels pass. The A 
atoms form a tetrahedron, the center of which is occupied by O' atoms, and the 
A–O'
–A angle is 109°28'
.
In the (MO3)2 network, M is located in a distorted octahedral coordination, while 
the O anion is in a linear coordination. The octahedra become more regular when x 
approaches 0.3125, and any deviation from this value is a measure of distortion in the 
octahedral network. The closest contact between the two networks occurs between 
the A cations of A2O' network and the oxygen atoms of the M2O6 network. However, 
these inter-network distances are always significantly larger than any intra-network 
distances. 
The two-network representation of the α-pyrochlore structure is more appropriate 
compared to the others, as it agrees with the presence of AM2O6 and A2M2O7–xx 
(is vacancy) “defective pyrochlores”, since here the octahedral network MO6 forms 
the “skeleton” of the structure and is preserved when vacancies occur. Given that, 
most x values of α-pyrochlores are close to the limit value of 0.3125, this description 
may well be suitable for most compounds. The main disadvantage of this model is 
that it apparently does not take into account the importance of the A and O' ion’s 
nature. It predicts the formation of the α-pyrochlore structure regardless of the A ion1 Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides 7

A2O'
nature, which is incorrect, for example, Cd2Nb2O7 crystallizes in the α-pyrochlore 
structure, while Ca2Nb2O7 and Sr2Nb2O7 do not. 
Many compounds with the α-pyrochlore structure undergo phase transitions, 
during which the structural type is preserved. However, various distortions of struc￾tural blocks occur, leading to a decrease in symmetry from the classical cubic 
centrosymmetric with the space group Fd3m. With certain combinations of cations 
in A and M positions, only such distorted α-pyrochlore structures can be observed. 
Among the most common types of distortions, one can distinguish tetragonal, 
rhombohedral and monoclinic. 
In the tetragonal distortion (Fig. 1.5), the typical grouping of the α-pyrochlore 
structure (a ring of six [MO6] octahedra) is no longer observed within one unit cell, 
but several. This building block is found in four unit cells during the Fd3m → I 4m2 
transition in Cd2Re2O7 [11, 12].
In this case, the decrease in symmetry is associated with the disordering of oxygen 
atoms and their displacement from their "ideal" positions 48f and 8b, while the metal 
atoms do not shift. It leads to a distortion of the octahedral environment of the M8 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov

atom: the lower the symmetry of the space group within the tetragonal system, the 
more pronounced such distortion (Fig. 1.5: Cd2Re2O7 Fd3m ↔ I 4m2 ↔ I 4122). 
As it can be seen from Fig. 1.6, monoclinic and orthorhombic distortion of the 
α-pyrochlore structure can be observed by the example of phase transitions in the 
Bi2Sn2O7 compound: Cc(α-form, monoclinic) → Aba2(β-form, orthorhombic) →
Fd3m (γ-form, cubic) (Fig. 1.6) [13]. In this case, not only the distortion of the 
octahedral environment around the Sn atom in the M position is observed, but also 
its displacement relative to its “ideal” position 16c, which leads to the appearance of 
Sn atoms of different types. 
In some cases, instead of the α-pyrochlore phase, when the distortion of structural 
blocks is large and there is a mismatch in the values of the radii of cations in the A 
and M positions, a related weberite phase is formed [14]. For instance, antimonates 
A2Sb2O7 (A = Ca, Pb, Sr) belong to this structural type [15]. The weberite structural 
type has the general formula of A2M2O7 and a structural motif similar to α-pyrochlore 
(Fig. 1.7); it crystallizes in the orthorhombic system with the space group Imma.
The main difference between the structures is that in the case of weberite not 
all octahedra [MO6] are connected to each other, meaning a full three-dimensional 
framework like in α-pyrochlore is not formed. In the weberite structure, there are 
several nonequivalent cation M positions (4b, 4c), and the octahedral environment is 
distorted, as the oxygen atoms are also shifted relative to positions in α-pyrochlore

transitions (a) and the X-ray diffraction patterns of each modifications (b) [13]1 Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides 11

(4e, 8h, 16j). Cations in the A position in the weberite structure are also in two 
nonequivalent positions, with one of them forming a highly distorted oxygen cubic 
environment (4a), and the second position and its environment fully correspond to 
the similar in α-pyrochlore (4b). 
X-ray diffraction patterns of distorted types of α-pyrochlore structure (Fig. 1.5b, 
1.6, 1.7b) become more complex as the symmetry of the structure decreases, which 
is associated with an increase in nonequivalent positions of atoms A and M and,12 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov

accordingly, crystallographic reflection planes. Whereas with a slight decrease in 
symmetry (as in the case of Cd2Re2O7, I 4m2) to the series of reflections of the 
space group Fd3m a small number of low-intensity additional peaks are added, 
which complicates the indexing procedure and requires thorough X-ray studies. 
1.2 Series of α-Pyrochlores with Composition A2 3+M2 4+O7 
A large number of known oxides with the α-pyrochlore structure belong to the type 
A2 
3+M2 
4+O7. It is due to the fact that many cations A3+ and M4+ have a suitable ionic 
radius for the formation of an octahedral framework. Ion A3+ can be represented by 
a rare earth element, Sc, Y, Bi, Tl or In, while M4+ can be a transition metal or any 
of the elements of group IVa of the Mendeleev table. 
Table 1.2 shows a stability field diagram for A2 
3+M2 
4+O7 α-pyrochlores, obtained 
by plotting the radius of the atom in position A (eightfold coordination) against the 
radius of the cation in position M (sixfold coordination) based on Shannon’s data for 
ionic radii [17].
It is known that the relative ionic radii or their rA3+/rM4+ ratio and the oxygen 
parameter (x) define the area of formation and stability of α-pyrochlore oxide. Such 
compounds can be formed in the rA3+/rM4+ area from 1.46 to 1.80 (rGd/rZr =
1.46, rSm/rTl = 1.78) at normal pressure. It was shown [18, 19] that the parameter 
rA3+/rM4+ can be increased up to 2.3 for α-pyrochlores of germanates and silicates 
under high pressure and temperature conditions. However, it should be noted that in 
some cases for the synthesis of some A2 
3+M2 
4+O7 α-pyrochlores might require high 
pressures, even if rA3+/rM4+ is in the range of 1.40–1.55. It can be explained by 
differences in compressibility between oxygen ions and atoms in A and M positions, 
i.e., it may require the application of pressure to force the smaller M ion into the 
structure with sixfold coordination or the larger A ion into eightfold coordination 
(for example, In3+ in In2Ge2O7). In some cases, redox thermodynamic parameters 
determine the formation of A2 
3+M2 
4+O7 α-pyrochlores, as evidenced by the absence 
of α-pyrochlores Ln2M2O7 with M = W4+ and Re4+ [20, 21], despite the fact that the 
criteria of ionic size, rA3+/rM4+ and charge neutrality criteria are satisfied to form 
these structures at normal pressure. 
The Ce role in the formation of the α-pyrochlore structure can be emphasized. The 
only α-pyrochlores, where cerium is in A position, are Ce2M2O7 (M = Ti, Zr and 
Sn) [22, 23]. Despite this, cerium in the oxidation state Ce4+ is capable of occupying 
the M position in A2M2O7, for example in Sm2Ce2O7–δ [24]. However, not for all Ln 
will the conditions of ion size ratio with Ce4+ for forming the α-pyrochlore structure 
be met and, for example La2Ce2O7, crystallizes in the structural type of defective 
fluorite [25]. 
All possible compositions of α-pyrochlores A2 
3+M2 
4+O7 are conveniently divided 
into groups by which element occupies the M position:14 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov Table 1.2 The formation field of α-pyrochlores in the series A2 3+

1. Metals of group IVb (Ti, Zr, Hf) 
The most studied and stable compounds with the classic cubic structure of α￾pyrochlore A2 
3+M2 
4+O7 are phases where the M position is occupied by metals from 
group IVb (Ti, Zr, Hf). Titanate compounds are known for almost all Ln3+ Ln2Ti2O7 
(Ln = Sm–Lu and Y) [26–28]. The parameters of the unit cell in the Ln2Ti2O7 series 
systematically decrease with the decrease in the Ln3+ ion radius. However, when Ln 
= La, Ce, Pr, and Nd, crystallization in the α-pyrochlore structure does not occur, as 
the values of rA3+/rM4+ exclude their formation. Solid solutions (Lu1– xScx)2Ti2O7, 
(Y1–xBi)2Ti2O7 and Ln2(Ti1–xMx)2O7 with M = Ge and Zr crystallize in the α￾pyrochlore structure when the rA3+/rM4+ values are satisfied for a particular x [27]. 
Neutron diffraction study of Sc2Ti2O7 showed that the compound has a defective 
fluorite structure [29], and Bi2Ti2O7 is a defective α-pyrochlore, which is isostruc￾tural with Bi2Sn2O7 [27]. Compounds with the α-pyrochlore structure A2Ti2O7,A 
= In, Cr, and Mn were not obtained, as the atoms of Cr and Mn are too small to 
occupy the A position [27]. The existence of an ordered orthorhombic structure of 
In2Ti2O7 α-pyrochlore is predicted by theoretical calculation. 
Zirconate α-pyrochlores Ln2Zr2O7 (Ln = La–Gd) are easily obtained and have 
a classic cubic structure [30, 31]. They are stable at room temperature, but at 
high temperature (>1500 °C) an order–disorder type phase transition is observed: 
α-pyrochlore-defective fluorite structure [32, 33]. 
Compounds Ln2Hf2O7 (Ln = La–Dy) are easily formed and have an ordered α￾pyrochlore structure, and when Ln = Dy–Lu and Y, the compounds have a disordered 
fluorite structure [34, 35]. Moreover, for all Ln = La–Dy, a “pyrochlore-fluorite” 
phase transition is observed. 
2. Group Vb metals (V, Nb, Ta) 
When the M position is occupied by atoms from group Vb (V, Nb, Ta), the possibilities 
for phase formation of α-pyrochlore structure decrease. Among α-pyrochlores based 
on vanadium, Ln2V2O7 (Ln = Tm, Yb, Lu and their solid solutions), their physical 
properties have been studied in the works [36, 37]. Unsuccessful attempts to obtain 
α-pyrochlores with Ln = Tb–Er, Y are likely related to the greater stability of their 
compounds with V3+ and V5+ with the perovskite LnVO3 and zircon LnVO4 structure 
[38, 39]. All obtained vanadate powders of α-pyrochlores have a black color and are 
stable under normal conditions (25°C), but decompose at 350–400 °C. In the works 
[40, 41] the possibility of the presence of V3+ in some compounds (Lu1–xAx)2V2O7 
with A = Sc, Y is emphasized. 
Compounds with the α-pyrochlore structure based on Nb can be obtained only 
under harsh conditions, Ln2Nb2O7 compounds (Ln = Er, Tm, and Lu) were synthe￾sized from Ln2O3 and NbO2 by arc melting [1]. However, it was always found that 
LnNbO4 is present as a second phase in significant amounts. Annealing at 1000 °C 
for a week in vacuum only led to an increase in the LnNbO4 impurity content. Thus, it 
turns out that the phases Ln2Nb2O7 form in a narrow (high) temperature range and are16 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
metastable. In the case of an octahedral framework based on tantalum, compounds 
with the α-pyrochlore structure form and are stable only at high pressures and have a 
complex composition with oxygen defects (K, Ln)2Ta2O7–y (Ln = Gd, Y, Lu), which 
ensures the formation of the phase [42, 43]. 
3. Group VIb metals (Cr, Mo, W) 
The most numerous family of compounds with the α-pyrochlore structure is formed 
in the case of M = Mo, while in the case of Cr the α-pyrochlore phase is found 
only for A = Tl, Y under conditions of high oxygen pressure and high temperature 
(>1100 °C) [44]. All compounds, except Y2Cr2O7, were obtained in pure form. The 
thallium analogue of dichromate thallium has the formula Tl2 
+Cr2 
6+O7 and is not 
α-pyrochlore. Also, in the case of M = W, α-pyrochlores were not obtained. 
Molybdate α-pyrochlores are formed for a wide range of A cations - Ln2Mo2O7 
(Ln = Sm–Lu, Y), and their physical properties have been particularly investigated 
[45, 46]. Compounds with Ln = La–Pr do not exist, and Nd2Mo2O7 were obtained 
only as an impurity phase. However, it has been shown that (Nd1–xLnx)2Mo2O7 (Ln 
= Er and Yb; x = 0.4–0.05) solid solutions have been synthesized, and already 10 
mol. % Yb can stabilize the cubic α-pyrochlore with Ln = Nd. The powders of the 
compounds are black in color and are stable in air and to moisture, but decompose 
when heated to T > 500 °C. 
Among these compounds, Ln2Mo2O7 attracts the greatest interest due to their 
magnetic properties. It can be explained on the basis of the one-electron energy 
band diagram proposed in the work [45]. Considering the α-pyrochlore structure 
as interpenetrating networks, where a strong bond between the M2O6 and A2O'
networks is observed, it can be seen that the hybridized orbitals eg, s and p of the metal 
in the M position will combine with O6 s- and p-orbitals, forming bonding (valence 
zone) and loosening (conduction zone) states (σ and σ*). Since atom A is linearly 
coordinated with two nearby oxygen atoms (O'
), an s–p-bonding is assumed, which 
will also lead to the corresponding σ and σ* states. Orbitals t2g of the M metal will 
form corresponding π- and π*-states. The π* states in most cases remain localized, 
but can form a narrow conduction zone, when M is a 4d- or 5d-transition metal. 
Spin–orbital interaction or trigonal distortion can lift the degeneracy of π*-states 
and give two sublevels or bands (π*a and π*b). The remaining two p-orbitals of A 
atom will combine with O6 s- and p-orbitals, giving A-Oσ and σ* levels, where each 
of them can contain eight (2 × 4) electrons (including spin). 
In Ln2Mo2O7 compounds, the Ln–O σ* level is empty and a total of 60 electrons 
are distributed in the valence band and localized levels [(2 × 3) + (2 × 6) + (7 × 6)]. 
Two Mo-4d electrons at the M–O π*a level generate pure spin magnetic moments 
(for example, Y2Mo2O7) and thermal excitation of these electrons to the Ln–Oσ* 
level (or to the M–O π*b level) leads to semiconducting behavior, which is indeed 
observed experimentally. In addition, the activation energy should be a measure of 
the “band gap” (Δ) and should increase as the size of the unit cell and the Ln–Mo 
distance in Ln2Mo2O7 decrease. The “band gap” decreases to zero for Ln = Sm 
or Nd, which leads to semi-metallic or metallic behavior. Similarly, the observed 
properties of Ln2V2O7 can be explained. In cases where A = Bi, the “lone pair”1 Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides 17
will occupy the Bi–Oσ* level, leading to a half-filled conduction band and metallic 
behavior. It is indeed observed in the phases Bi2Ru2O7 and Bi2Os2O7. However, 
it should be noted that the one-electron band model is empirical and explains the 
observed physical properties of α-pyrochlores qualitatively. 
4. Group VIIb metals (Mn, Tc, Re) 
A rather limited number of compounds lead to the formation of the α-pyrochlore 
structure when the M position is occupied by atoms of group VIIb. α-Pyrochlores 
A2M2O7 based on Mn were obtained only for A = Tl, In, Y, Ho, Yb [47, 48]. 
Such compounds are characterized by classic cubic symmetry, however, the authors 
observed ferroelectric ordering in the structure at high temperatures due to the 
presence of a small amount of Mn3+ and spin interaction between Mn3+ and Mn4+. 
Compounds with the α-pyrochlore structure based on Tc were obtained for compo￾sitions Ln2Tc2O7 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Er, Lu) and were studied in detail as 
matrices for the immobilization of radioactive waste for 99Tc [49] A detailed study 
of the electronic structure, as well as the prediction of the compound formation with 
A = Ce–Pm, Tb, Ho, Tm is described in the work [50]. For rhenium, the composition 
(Pr, Nd)2Re2O7(OH) is known, which, however, does not belong to the pyrochlore 
structural type [51]. 
5. Group VIIIb metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt) 
In the case of metals from group VIIIb, rather wide conditions of α-pyrochlore 
phase formation are observed for Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt. α-Pyrochlores based on 
ruthenium are characterized by classical cubic symmetry for compositions A2Ru2O7 
with A = Pr–Lu, Y, Bi, and Tl, whereas for A = Ln a perovskite structure with 
orthorhombic symmetry is formed [52–57]. Ln2Ru2O7 and some solid solutions 
by position A (Nd, Bi, Gd, Bi, etc.) are stoichiometric, whereas in pure Bi- and 
Tl-containing α-pyrochlores, slight non-stoichiometry by oxygen can be observed 
at low temperatures, which leads to the ordering of the structure and changes in 
electronic behavior [58]. 
The observed electrical and magnetic properties of α-pyrochlores based on ruthe￾nium are well explained using the one-electron MO energy band diagram. The semi￾conductor behavior of Ln2Ru2O7 and Tl2Ru2O7 can be easily predicted, as the Ln–O 
σ* level is empty. In Bi2Ru2O7 this level (Bi–O σ*) is half-filled (with a pair of 6s2 
electrons), which leads to metallic behavior. 
Stoichiometric α-pyrochlores based on Rh were only obtained for (Y, Lu)2Rh2O7 
under high pressure and high temperature conditions and are characterized by cubic 
symmetry [59, 60]. The classical α-pyrochlore Bi2Rh2O7 is characterized by oxygen 
deficiency (δ = 0.2), however, when the synthesis conditions are changed (under 
high pressure), the perovskite BiRhO3 is formed [61]. Similar to α-pyrochlores with 
Rh, compounds with palladium Ln2Pd2O7 (Ln = Sm, Gd–Yb, Y, Sc, and In) can 
only be obtained under high pressure and temperature conditions (65 kbar, 1000 °C) 
[62].18 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
Compounds with the cubic α-pyrochlore structure in the case of Os are formed 
quite easily and are stable Ln2Os2O7 (Ln = Pr–Lu, Y, Bi, and Tl) [63, 64]. α￾Pyrochlores Ln2Ir2O7 (Ln = Pr–Lu, Y, Bi, and Tl) are characterized by classical 
symmetry and undergo a phase transition “metal–insulator” at T < 150 K [65, 66]. 
Compounds A2Pt2O7 (A = Pr–Lu, Y, Sc, In, Tl and Bi) are obtained under high 
temperature and pressure (700 °C; 3 kbar; presence of KClO 3 at 1100 °C). They 
exhibit magnetic properties at low temperatures, for example, when Ln = Dy the 
compound is a spin ice [62, 67, 68]. Powders of compounds A2Pt2O7 are stable up 
to 1000 °C when heated in air, except for A = In (decomposition at 860 °C) or Tl 
(decomposition at 1025 °C), as shown by DTA and TGA studies. 
6. Metals of IVa, Va, VIa, VIIa and VIIIa groups 
In the case of main subgroup metals of groups IV, V, VI, VII and VIII, the formation 
of compounds with the structure of α-pyrochlore is possible only for IVa (Si, Ge, 
Sn and Pb). Moreover, such phases tend to form various polymorphic modifications, 
among which the classical cubic is the least stable under normal conditions. 
Silicon-based α-pyrochlores were obtained only for compositions A2Si2O7 with 
A = In, Sc and are stable under high pressure of 120 kbar [19]. Sc2Si2O7 has the 
smallest value of the unit cell parameter among compounds with the α-pyrochlore 
structure. For A = Ln, disilicates Ln2Si2O7 (Ln = Er, Ho, Tm, Yb) are known [69], 
however, they have monoclinic symmetry. 
Cubic germanate α-pyrochlores A2Ge2O7 (A = Gd–Lu, Y, Sc, In and Tl) were 
obtained using high pressure methods (65 kbar, up to 1200 °C) [18]. Phases with 
Ln = Gd, Ho and Dy attract attention due to their magnetic properties [70–73]. 
In the case of A = In, two polymorphic modifications may exist: monoclinic and 
cubic, however, quantum-chemical calculation method shows that the first one is 
more stable [74]. 
Compounds A2Sn2O7 (Ln = La–Lu, Y) have a cubic α-pyrochlore structure and 
are well studied in the literature [75, 76]. Phases with A =Sc and Tl were not obtained, 
and in the case of In, monoclinic and cubic modifications were found, however, 
the monoclinic structure is more stable under normal conditions [74]. The cubic 
structure of α-pyrochlore Bi2Sn2O7 is formed, but at room temperature the compound 
is characterized by monoclinic symmetry (α-form) and during phase transformations 
upon heating it changes to orthorhombic (β-form above 100 °C) and cubic (γ-form 
above 680 °C) [13]. The phase transition α–β is the first order, and the transition β–γ— 
the second order. Impurities and partial replacement of Bi in position A always lead 
to the stabilization of the β-form at room temperature [77]. Bi2Sn2O7 decomposes 
at T > 1200 °C. 
The crystal chemical data for Ln2Sn2O7 show that the shape of the oxygen octa￾hedron is determined by the x-parameter of oxygen (48f), which has a value of 
5/16 (0.3125) for a regular octahedron. As the size of the Ln ion increases, the 
ionic environment of Sn4+ becomes more symmetrical (i.e., approaches the regular 
coordination, as the x parameter decreases) [78]. 
All known phases with Pb crystallize in the classic cubic symmetry of α￾pyrochlore. The formation of La2Pb2O7 is possible at a pressure of 1 atm [29], and1 Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides 19
for a series of Ln2Pb2O7 (Ln = La–Gd)—at high pressures (3 kbar, 700 °C) [79], 
while Bi2Pb2O7 forms under mild hydrothermal conditions [80]. In the case of Ln 
= Tb–Er, Y, phases with a defective fluorite structure are formed [81]. Compounds 
of α-pyrochlores are not stable above 300 °C and lose oxygen. 
For several decades, the study of compounds with the α-pyrochlore structure have 
been carried out by not only using X-ray analysis but also the IR spectroscopy. It 
can be noted that their main feature is the presence of a broad band with a maximum 
absorption in the range of 600–400 cm–1, on which a fine structure is observed 
in the areas of 350–200 and 200–100 cm–1. The observed infrared bands of all α￾pyrochlores are characterized by similar features: the band at 500–600 cm–1 is the 
most intense, followed by ~450 cm–1 and ~400 cm–1 with slightly less or equal 
intensity. The intensity of all other peaks does not exceed 30% of the intensity of the 
main three bands. Apparently, the position of the band maxima is influenced by the 
radius of the A3+ ion, the mass of the A element, and the presence of the A element 
in group IIIa or IIIb (Ln). 
Vibrational spectra are used to demonstrate that compounds have a cubic α￾pyrochlore structure and to establish the boundary of existence of this structural 
type. For example, the IR spectra of Ln2Ti2O7 for Ln = La–Nd, which do not crys￾tallize in the α-pyrochlore structure, differ significantly in the number and position of 
bands and general features from the IR spectra of the α-pyrochlores [36, 40, 82]. For 
example, Fig. 1.8 shows the IR spectra of a series of solid solutions Y2Sn2−xZrxO7, 
where the α-pyrochlore structure is formed at x < 1.2, and the fluorite one is at x > 
1.2 [83]. 
For compounds Ln2Zr2O7 (Ln=La–Gd) the IR and Raman spectra (600–50 cm–1) 
are noticeably simplified due to the broadening of some peaks and the disappearance
Fig. 1.8 IR spectra of Y2Sn2−xZrxO7 solid solutions [83] 20 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
of weak bands from La to Gd [33, 82, 84, 85]. It is a direct consequence of the 
decrease in the stability of the α-pyrochlore structure, expressed in the reduction of 
their homogeneity area both in composition and in temperature. Since the spectral 
characteristics of the disordered fluorite phase differ from the α-pyrochlore phase, 
studies unequivocally indicate the boundary of existence of the α-pyrochlore phase 
in Ln2Zr2O7 for different Ln and depending on the temperature for Gd2Zr2O7. 
The IR spectra of Ln2Ru2O7 in the range of 700–50 cm–1 have the shape typical 
for α-pyrochlore. However, in some cases, there are nine observed bands instead of 
the predicted seven. A noticeable increase in the splitting of absorption bands may 
indicate some local distortion of the oxygen polyhedron around the A3+ ion in the 
structure [86]. 
7. Solid solutions A2 
3+M2 
4+O7 with substitution at positions A and M 
According to the unit cell electroneutrality, there is a possibility of replacing the 
A cation in α-pyrochlore A2 
3+M2 
4+O7 with ion pairs (A3 
+, A1 
3+), (A2+, A4+) or 
(A+, A5+). Suitable combinations are (alkali element, rare earth element), (alka￾line earth element, group IVa, b element) or (alkali element, group V element), 
which also satisfy the criteria of the ionic radius ratio. However, it should be 
noted that the alkali metal (Li, Na) tends to volatilize under high-temperature reac￾tion conditions and can stabilize phases with a deficit of metals and anions under 
these conditions. As examples of the cubic α-pyrochlores formation with substi￾tutions at position A, a large number of different bismuth-containing compounds 
can be presented (Bi1−xLix)2−dTi2O7−3d/2 [87], Bi1.6Mg0.2Ti2O6.6, Bi1.6Sc0.4Ti2O7, 
Bi1.6Cu0.2Ti2O6.6 [88], Bi2Ti1.5M0.5O7 (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) [89], Ln2−xBixTi2O7 Ln 
= La–Lu and Y [90], Bi1.6CrxTi2O6.4+1.5x (0.016 ≤ x ≤ 0.16) [91], Bi1.6Zn0.2Ti2O7−δ , 
Bi1.6Co0.23Ti2O7−δ and Bi1.6Mg0.4Cu0.4Nb1.6O7−δ [92]. However, there are cases of 
lowering the symmetry of the structure, for example (Bi1–xGax)2–dTi2O7−3d/2 (cubic, 
F4132) [93]. 
The synthesis of such mixed α-pyrochlores by the solid-state method has shown 
the possibility of phase formation in some cases, as in addition to the criterion of ionic 
radius, differences in charge, electronic configuration, and polarizability of cations 
play a role in stabilizing the cubic α-pyrochlore structure. 
The substitution of an atom in the M position is possible within a wide range of 
different atoms, which leads to the formation of a large number of new compounds. 
For the structural series A2 
3+M2 
4+O7, it is known that pairs of ions such as (M3+M'5+), 
(M2/3 
2+M'
4/3 
5+) and (M4/3 
5+W2/3 
6+) can be placed in the M position. Many new phases 
retain the classical cubic symmetry: Bi1.4(Mg1−xNix)0.7Ta1.4O6.3, Bi2(Zn1/3Ta2/3)2O7, 
(Bi3/2Zn1/2)(Zn1/2Ta3/2)O7 [94, 95], Bi2(MM'
)O7,M = Cr, Fe, Sc, In; M' = Nb, Ta 
and Sb [96–98], Ln'
2(Ln'
Sb)O7 (Ln = or /= Ln' = La–Lu, Y) [99, 100], Ln2(ScNb)O7 
(Ln = La, Nd, Sm [101]), Bi2(M2/3 
2+M'
4/3 
5+)O7,M = Mg, Ni, M' = Nb, Ta [97, 98] 
and Ln2(V4/3W2/3)O7, Ln = Gd–Lu, Y [102]. However, phases the Ln2(Ln'
M)O7 (M 
= Nb, Ta) and Ln2(Fe4/3W2/3)O7, Ln = Gd–Yb, Y, crystallize in an orthorhombic 
or defective fluorite structure [101]. Solid solutions of the Er2(V1−xFex)4/3W2/3O7 
are easily formed at all x, and at x > 0.2 a transition from cubic to orthorhombic 
symmetry occurs [103].1 Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides 21
In addition, there is information about mixed α-pyrochlores with the compo￾sition of (A2+A'3+)(M4+M'5+)O7 (A2+ = Ca, Sr, Ba, Cd, Pb; A'3+ = La, Sm, Bi; 
M4+ = Tl, Zr, Hf, Sn; M'5+ = Nb, Ta) [104–106]. However, the α-pyrochlore 
phase is almost not observed for cations A2+ = Ba and M5+ = Ta, as they are 
more likely to lead to the fluorite structure formation. In addition, phases with a 
cubic α-pyrochlore structure were found among the compositions (CdLn)(TiNb)O7 
(Ln = La–Lu) [1], (A2+A'3+)(TiSb)O7 (A2+ = Zn, Cd, Pb; A'3+ = La–Eu, Bi) [1], 
(A1+Ln3+)(Zr4+Mo6+)O7 (A = Li, Na; Ln = La, Sm) [97], (Cd2+Ln3+)(M3+W6+)O7 
(Ln = Gd–Lu, Y, Bi; M = V, Cr, Mn and Fe) [1, 102]. 
It can be seen that the possibilities for the formation of α-pyrochlores are very 
extensive, which is associated with high stability and elemental capacity of the struc￾tural type. However, it should be taken into account that during the synthesis of 
α-pyrochlores, the presence of volatile elements (Li, Na, Cd, Pb, Mo) can lead to 
non-stoichiometry between the cation and anion, and the presence of polyvalent 
elements (Fe, Mn, Mo and Nb) can change the charge balance and lead either to 
non-stoichiometry, or to distortion of the cubic structure of α-pyrochlore. In this 
regard, for clear determination of the features of the α-pyrochlore crystal structure, 
growing single crystals and refining the structure by X-ray diffraction analysis should 
be implemented. 
1.2.1 Series of α-Pyrochlores with Composition A2 
2+M2 
5+O7 
The α-pyrochlore crystal structure can also be formed in a series of compositions with 
the general formula A2 
2+M2 
5+O7, however, there are much fewer such compounds 
compared to A2 
3+M2 
4+O7. It is due to the fact that there are fewer cations A2+ and 
M5+ suitable in size and characteristics for the corresponding coordination than A3+ 
and M4+ cations. In all known α-pyrochlores A2 
2+M2 
5+O7 the cation A2+ is Cd, Hg, 
Ca, Pb, Sn or Mn, and M5+ is V, Nb, Ru, Rh, Ta, Re, Os, Ir, U or Sb. In addition, V5+ 
hardly forms the α-pyrochlore structure under normal conditions, as it rarely has a 
coordination higher than five in oxide compounds. For stabilizing it in an octahedral 
environment, synthesis methods at high pressure are used, as a result it was possible 
to obtain A2V2O7 phases with A = Cd, Hg. In many cases, when M is a noble metal, 
non-stoichiometric (oxygen-deficient) phases are obtained. Studies show that in Sn￾containing compounds, in addition to Sn2+ in the A-position, Sn4+ can be present in 
the M-position. 
Table 1.3 presents a stability field diagram for a series of compounds A2 
3+M2 
4+O7 
[107]. The largest and smallest ions in the A2+ position are Pb2+ (r(VIII) = 1.29 Å) 
and Mn2+ (r(VIII) = 0.96 Å), respectively, while in the M5+ position, the ion size 
range is from U5+ (0.76 Å) to V5+ (0.54 Å). The ratio of ionic radii r(A2+)/r(M5+) 
ranges from 1.4 to 2.2. The dependence of the A2+ ionic radius (r (VIII)) on the lattice 
parameter or the unit cell volume shows linear behavior for this M5+ ion (for example, 
Nb, Ta, and Sb), indicating the predominant effect of ion size in the α-pyrochlores 
formation.22 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov

When position A is occupied by metals of group IIa, b, the greatest stability and 
diversity of A–M cations combinations is observed for Cd and Ca. 
The compositions Ca2Nb2O7 and Ca2Ta2O7 form with the classic cubic α￾pyrochlore structure [107, 108], while Ca2Sb2O7 can exist in modifications of α￾pyrochlore and weberite. The high-temperature solid-phase reaction always gives 
the weberite phase (or their mixture), while the low-temperature reaction (<700 °C) 
in a mixture of hydrated metal salt with formic acid (Baccaredda method) gives the 
cubic α-pyrochlore [16, 107]. The transformation of α-pyrochlore into weberite for 
the structure Ca2Sb2O7, apparently, occurs at > 700°C. According to the authors 
[109] small amounts of F, replacing O, can stabilize the structure of α-pyrochlore. 
The compounds Ca2Sb2O6.5F and Ca1.56Sb2O6.37F0.44 are stable up to 1000°C, and no 
phase transition is detected. Analogues with the cubic α-pyrochlore structure based 
on Sr were obtained only for the mixed composition (SrLi)Ta2O6F [1], while the 
compound Sr2Sb2O7 crystallizes in the structure of weberite and does not transform 
into α-pyrochlore. 
Os-based α-pyrochlores are well studied, ant it has shown the formation possibility 
of both stoichiometric cubic α-pyrochlore Ca2Os2O7 by a direct reaction from oxides 
and the orthorhombic phase Ca2Os2O7 obtained by decomposition of perovskite 
CaOsO3 [110–112]. Such a non-cubic α-pyrochlore, when heated above 855 °C, 
loses oxygen from the lattice, forming a non-stoichiometric phase Ca2Os2O7−δ (0.1 
< δ < 0.6) with a cubic α-pyrochlore structure. Moreover, under high-pressure condi￾tions, non-stoichiometric cubic α-pyrochlore Ca1.7Os2O7 is formed from oxides 
[113]. In the case of Sr, only an oxygen-deficient α-pyrochlore structure is observed 
Sr2Os2O6.4, which is stable up to 1070 °C [114]. Based on DTA, TGA, and other 
studies, it is suggested that Os does not exist in the oxidation state 5 + in the 
compound, and the compound formula can be written as Sr2Os4+ 
2−δOs6+ 
δO6.0+δ1 Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides 23
at 0.2 < δ < 0.6. Moreover, Ca-contaning cubic α-pyrochlore with composition of 
Ca2Ir2O7 is also known [113]. 
In contrast to phases with A = Ca and Sr, when the position is occupied by 
Cd and Hg atoms, the formation of α-pyrochlores based on vanadium Cd2V2O7 
and Hg2V2O7, as well as the solid solutions Cd2–xAxV2O7 (A = In, Tl) and 
Cd2V2–xNbxO7, become possible [115–117]. The α-pyrochlore structure for the 
compositions Cd2V2O7 and Hg2V2O7 has a monoclinic distortion. The compound 
is likely non-stoichiometric or contains V4+. When heated in air at 400 °C for 2 h, it 
transitions to a more stable modification, which does not have the pyrochlore struc￾ture, with a decrease in density by 18.5%. Despite this Cd2–xAxV2O7 (A = In, Tl) 
and Cd2V2–xNbxO7 solid solutions show an increase in symmetry from monoclinic 
to tetragonal or cubic upon heating. 
Cadmium niobate Cd2Nb2O7 has a classic cubic structure and is the most studied 
compound of A2 
2+M2 
5+O7 α-pyrochlores [118, 119], as it exhibits ferroelectric 
properties at low temperatures [120] and undergoes a ferroelectric phase transition 
[121, 122]. 
Replacing Cd into Pb, Ca, Sr, (Na1/2Bi1/2) [118] leads to the solid solutions’ 
formation in a limited range of compositions (20% for Ca and 90% for Pb). Using high 
pressure of 58 kbar and 1100 °C during synthesis [123, 124] it is possible to increase 
the proportion of Cd substitution with Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn to ~ 0.5, 
while at atmospheric pressure the degree of substitution is less than 2 atom. %. Since 
these elements have an ionic radius smaller than Cd2+, α-pyrochlores are formed 
with orthorhombic or triclinic symmetry rather than cubic. The Cd2Nb2–xMxO7 solid 
solutions with M = V, Ta, Sb, or Ti4+ (and Bi3+ for Cd) [118, 123, 124] are formed 
over the entire x range for Ta, while other elements lead to the α-pyrochlore only 
in a limited range. The work [125] showed the possibility of replacing part of the 
oxygen with sulfur in Cd2Nb2O7 while maintaining the α-pyrochlore phase. The 
area of formation of solid solutions Cd2Nb2O7–xSx is wide 0 < x < 1, it was also 
possible to obtain a series of solutions Cd2–xZnxNb2O6S for x < 1.60 in the case 
of A = Zn and for x < 0.4 in the case of A = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu [126]. 
Detailed structural, dielectric, DTA, dilatometric, and SHG studies of Cd2Nb2O6S 
[96] showed that the phase at room temperature is tetragonal. However, after heating, 
it undergoes orthorhombic distortion at 379 K and becomes a ferroelectric (γ-phase), 
which transforms to tetragonal at 457 K (β-phase), but retains ferroelectric properties. 
At 555 K, a cubic α-pyrochlore (α) phase is obtained, which is paraelectric. The δ →
γ transition is accompanied by a rather large change in enthalpy, while for the other 
two transitions (γ → β, β → α) the thermal effect is an order of magnitude smaller. 
Phases of F-substituted α-pyrochlores Cd2Nb2O7 are also stabilized Cd2NbMO6F 
(M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Ge, Sn), Cd2(Nb/Ta)MO5F2 (M3+ = A1, Cr, Ga, Fe and Sc) [1] and 
Cd2Ti2O5F2 [127], except for the composition with M = Zr or Hf, which possesses 
a deformed orthorhombic structure. In the Cd2Nb2–2xM4+ 
2xO7–xF2x (M4+ = Ge, Sn, 
Ti, and Zr) the formation of solid solutions was found for Ge and Sn in the range 0 
< x < 0.5, and for Zr at 0 < x < 0.875. In the region 0.25 < x < 0.55 orthorhombic 
distortion of cubic α-pyrochlore is observed due to the ordered distribution of Nb 
and Zr in the (111) planes of the unit cell [128].24 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
The structural analogue of Cd2Nb2O7 with Ta also forms with cubic symmetry, a 
complete series of solid solutions Cd2(NbxTa1–x)2O7 and is characterized by similar 
physical properties [129–131]. 
The Cd2Ru2O7, Cd2Re2O7, Cd2Ir2O7 and Cd2Os2O7 phases also crystallize with 
the classic cubic α-pyrochlore structure, and only the Os-containing compound is 
characterized by a small oxygen non-stoichiometry [113, 132, 133]. The compound 
Cd2Re2O7 undergoes a phase transition below 200 K (Fd3m → I 4m2), with the 
low-temperature modification exhibiting superconductivity [134–137]. The osmium￾containing phase also has a low-temperature “conductor–insulator” phase transition 
below 227 K and has a mercury-containing analogue Hg2Os2O7 [138–140]. 
The compound Cd2Sb2O7 can exist in two crystallographic modifications: cubic 
α-pyrochlore and orthorhombic weberite. The structure of weberite is less dense, so 
the application of pressure (65 kbar, 700°C) causes the transformation of weberite 
into α-pyrochlore [107, 141, 142]. However, both forms can be realized at atmo￾spheric pressure and are thermally stable. The α-pyrochlore phase Cd1.9Sb2O6.9 is 
non-stoichiometric and contains some amount of Sb3+. It decomposes around 1100°C 
into stoichiometric weberite Cd2Sb2O7. In the series of compounds A2Sb2O7 [107] 
the stability region of the α-pyrochlore phase has been studied and it has been found 
that this is influenced by the effective size of the A ion and the covalency of the A-O 
bond. Large cations (or mixed cations, Ca, Sr, (NaLa) etc.) and small values of elec￾tronegativity favor the weberite structure, while the opposite leads to the α-pyrochlore 
structure. 
Substituted phases of the Cd2–xBix(Sb2–xTix)O7 type, 0.50 < x < 1.55, 
Cd2Sb2–2xM2xO7–2xF2x with M = Ti (x < 1.0), Sn (x < 0.55), Ge (x < 0.4), and Zr ( 
x < 0.6) and Cd2SbHfO6F were also obtained with the cubic α-pyrochlore structure 
[1]. 
Hg-containing analogs Hg2M2O7 with M = Nb, Ta and Sb crystallize with the 
classic cubic α-pyrochlore structure [5]. A slight non-stoichiometry appears in all 
compounds, which is confirmed by differences in color and cell sizes for a given 
composition. Fluorine-substituted Hg-containing α-pyrochlores, Hg2M2+F6(O/S) 
with M = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, have cubic symmetry, are stable in air, non￾hygroscopic, but decompose at 800 °C [143]. Structural refinement according to 
XRD data of compounds showed that O or S occupy the O' position in the A2M2O6O'
lattice. 
In addition, the position A in A2 
2+M2 
5+X7 can be occupied by atoms of Sn, Pb, Mn, 
Co, Ni. Sn-containing niobates and tantalates crystallize in the cubic α-pyrochlore 
structure and are characterized by compositional non-stoichiometry [107], while the 
compound Sn2Sb2O7 does not form the α-pyrochlore structure. Studies of compounds 
Sn2M2O7 (M = Nb, Ta) revealed several interesting aspects [144]. 
First, both cationic and anionic vacancies are usually formed in the unit cell, 
and Sn2+ is partially oxidized to Sn4+; the general formula can be written as 
Sn2+ 
2–x(M5+ 
2–ySn4+ 
y)O7–x–0.5y (M = Nb, Ta). The values of x and y may not coin￾cide and vary within 0.48–0.10. The case of ideal stoichiometry, when x and y are1 Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides 25
zero, is not realized in practice. It is likely related to the Sn2+ oxidation under high￾temperature synthesis conditions (~ 900 °C), and after the Sn4+ formation, it includes 
Nb or Ta, and does not occupy Sn2+ position because of the ions’ size. 
Secondly, the determined structure by X-ray diffraction analysis showed that for 
the composition (M = Ta, x = 0.24, y = 0.44) Sn2+ is displaced from the position 
3m (center of inversion) by 0.38 ± 0.24 Å. Thus, these phases do not belong to the 
centrosymmetric space group Fd3m of the ideal α-pyrochlore structure. Confirma￾tory data were obtained by detecting SHG signals for many phases containing Nb 
and Ta. 
It is now known that, Pb compounds, as well as Sn-containing α-pyrochlores, are 
non-stoichiometric, can contain a significant amount of Pb4+ ions in the structure, 
however they are characterized by cubic symmetry [107, 145]. The general formula 
can be written as Pb2+ 
2(Pb4+ xM5+ 
2–x)O7–0.5x or Pb2+ 
2–xM2O7–x (M = Nb, Ta, Sb) [1]. 
For Pb in the A position stoichiometric phases Pb2M2O7 (M = Nb, Sb, and U) 
can be formed [1, 118], however, all of them demonstrate orthorhombic distortion 
(except M = U, which has a cubic structure). It can be expected, as Pb2+ has lone 
electron pair, which can lead to a significant deviation from the centrosymmetric 
space group Fd3m. 
Most α-pyrochlores of metals M = Tc, Ru, Rh, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt are characterized 
by non-stoichiometry and the presence of Pb in two oxidation states (Pb4+ and Pb2+). 
Pb2Rh2O7 is stoichiometric, however it is an α-pyrochlore of another Pb4+ 
2Rh3+ 
2O7 
composition. In the phases Pb2M2O7–δ (δ < 1.0, M – noble metal) with O deficiency, 
the defect phase of α-pyrochlore is stabilized to a greater extent than the perovskite 
structure due to the lone electron pair Pb [3]. It is possible that the M site may 
contain some amount of Pb4+, and the phases may possess vacancies in the A and O'
positions, similarly to the case of Sn2+-containing α-pyrochlores. 
Compounds with the α-pyrochlore structure Pb2M2O7–δ (M = Tc, δ = 1.0 [20]; 
M = Ir, Ru, and Re, δ < 1.0 [3]; M = Os, δ < 1.0 [112]) were obtained under normal 
pressure, and many of them, including substances with M = Rh and Pt, are formed 
under high pressure conditions. 
The Mn2Sb2O7 phase, depending on the synthesis, can be formed with the classic 
cubic α-pyrochlore structure or the monoclinic one [107, 146, 147]. As in the case 
with Ca2Sb2O7, the inclusion of F stabilizes the structure in Mn2Sb2O7 [109]. 
Structural analogs for A = Co and Ni have also been obtained in cubic symmetry 
[148]. 
In the structure of α-pyrochlore A2 
2+M2 
5+O7, pairs of ions (A2+A2+'
) and (A+A3+) 
can occupy the position A. However, among such compounds (Na+, Ln3+)Sb2O7, Ln 
= La–Dy, and (A2+A'2+)Sb2O7 with (CaCd), (SrCd), (CaPb), and (CaSr), many form 
the weberite structure [1]. 
Although such pairs of ions (M4+M6+'
), (M3+ 
2/3M6+ 
1/3'
) and (M2+ 
1/2M6+ 
3/2'
) can 
be placed in the M position, among the compositions Cd2(M4+W6+)O7 (M = Ti, Zr, 
Sn), Cd2(M3+ 
2/3W6+ 
1/3)O7 (M = Al, Sc, Y, Mn, Fe), Cd2(M2+ 
1/2W6+ 
3/2)O7 (M =
Mg, Zn, Cd, Ni) are formed, only A2(TiW)O7 with A = Cd, Sn and Pb possess cubic 
α-pyrochlore structure [1].26 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
1.2.2 Compounds A2M2O6 with Defect α-Pyrochlore 
Structure 
As mentioned earlier, the structure of α-pyrochlore A2M2O6O' allows for vacancies 
in the A and O' positions with the formation of A2M2O6 (AMO3) and AM2O6
'
or A2M2O5O' (AM2O6) phases. Moreover, compounds with the general formula 
A2M2O6 are classified as defective α-pyrochlore, and those with the formula AM2O6 
are assigned to the β-pyrochlore. In the A2M2O6 structure (Fig. 1.9), A can be any 
element in oxidation states 1+, 2+ or 3+ (including Tl+ and Ag+), and M can be an 
element in oxidation state 3+, 4+ or 5+, and the O' position is vacant.
In addition, substitution in the M and O positions can give compounds of the 
A2(MM'
)O6 and (AxM2OxF1–x)2 types. The M2O6 network, formed by common 
angles of MO6 octahedra, is quite rigid and stable. However, due to the atypical 
stereochemical relationship between positions 16d and 8b in the structure of α￾pyrochlore, and also because the number of A ions is less than the number of available 
sites for filling in A2M2O6, A ions are highly mobile, despite the large ionic radius 
(especially in the case of monovalent elements Cs, Tl, Ag). Thus, H2O molecules 
or H3O+ and NH4+ ions can be placed in A position with the α-pyrochlore structure 
preserved. 
Also, the structure of defective α-pyrochlore can be characterized by reduced 
symmetry. However, the reduction is often observed within the framework of cubic 
symmetry (mainly up to the space group F43m). Comparison of the X-ray diffraction 
patterns (Fig. 1.9b) of α-pyrochlore and defective α-pyrochlore with Fd3m shows 
that the last one exhibits all the same reflections and only their relative intensity 
changes. 
A relatively small number of A2M2O6 compounds form the α-pyrochlore structure 
instead of the usual perovskite structure. It occurs when A and M ions are highly 
polarized, and A-O and/or M–O bonds are strongly covalent [8]. Crystal data for 
known phases are given in Table 1.4.
Stoichiometric compositions A2M2O6 with the α-pyrochlore structure have 
Tl2M2O6 (M = Nb, Ta and U), Pb2Tc2O6, Bi2M2O6 (M = Sc, Ni, Co, Y) [20, 
149–151]. In antimonates A2Sb2O6 (A = Ag, Tl, K) Sb is simultaneously in oxida￾tion states 3 + and 5 + [141, 151, 152]. Detailed structural analysis of antimonates 
containing Tl and K [153, 154] showed that while A ions occupy positions 32e, Sb3+ 
ions occupy the 96g positions rather than the 16d positions. 
The compositions A2Ta2O6 (A = Na, K) are of great interest due to the formation 
possibility of both the defective α-pyrochlore structure and the perovskite structure 
(ATaO3), depending on the synthesis conditions [155]. 
Defective α-pyrochlores with cubic symmetry Pb2GaNbO6, Pb2CrTaO6, 
Cd2ScTaO6, Cd2MnTaO6, Cd2CrNbO6, Cd2SbNbO6 etc., substituted at the M posi￾tion, are also known. Although in the case of most other atom’s combinations in the 
A and M positions, perovskite structure is formed [149, 156–158].1 Structural Type of α-Pyrochlore Oxides 27

2.1 General Characteristics and Features of the Crystal 
Structure 
When the α-pyrochlore structure loses weakly bound anions O’, a series of defective 
pyrochlores with the general formula A2-xM2O6O’1–y with ionic vacancies in A and 
X’ positions are formed. The last member of this defective pyrochlores is called β￾pyrochlore with the general formula AM2O6. It loses all X’ ions and half of A ions, so 
its formula can be represented as AM2O6 relative to the α-pyrochlore structure. The 
A position in this case is occupied by monovalent cations, therefore to maintain the 
electroneutrality of the unit cell of A+M2O6, the M position is occupied by atoms with 
different valence, for example, Nb5+/Ta5+/Sb5+ and W6+/Mo6+/Te6+. If their physical 
characteristics, such as ionic radius and electronegativity, are close, then β-pyrochlore 
AM2O6 retains the ideal β-pyrochlore structure—a cubic centrosymmetric structure 
with Fd3m. In addition, atoms in the A position also determine the stability of the 
β-pyrochlore structure type. Thus, in the series of alkali elements, the ability to form 
a β-pyrochlore structure decreases with a decrease in the cation radius. In some 
cases, for atoms Na or Li, β-pyrochlore can only be obtained by using ion exchange 
reactions [1]. 
For both α- and β-pyrochlore structures, all atoms are in general positions, except 
for the oxygen atom in position 48f. Figure 2.1 shows a displacement of atoms in 
crystallographic positions with the loss of all O(1) atoms (in position 8a) and half of 
the A cations in the structure A2M2O7.
Thus, the remaining half of the A cations move from position 16c to position 
8b, which is empty in the structure A2M2O7, and the M cations shift from 16d 
to 16c. Therefore, in the structure AM2O6 positions 16d and 8a become vacant.

Phases AI
M2O6 with a β-pyrochlore structure are traditionally represented analo￾gously to the α-pyrochlore structure as a three-dimensional framework, constructed 
from octahedra [MO6], where A+ cations are located in the cavities (Fig. 2.2). The 
classical ideal β-pyrochlore structure is described within the cubic symmetry Fd3m,2 Structural Type of β-Pyrochlore Oxides AM2O6 39

and the classical stoichiometry is the ratio of cations MV and MVI equal to 1:1, which 
is associated with the most extensive group of obtained compounds. 
However, the occupation of the M position by atoms, which have significantly 
different physical characteristics, leads not only to distortions of octahedral groups 
[MO6], but also to a decrease in the structure symmetry. Often, the decrease in 
symmetry is associated only with minor movements of atoms, and only X-ray 
singe-crystal diffraction analysis in combination with the measurement of second 
harmonic generation (SHG) allows to define the crystal structure and the space 
group of the compound. Crystallization of β-pyrochlores in low-symmetry modi￾fications in most cases is accompanied by the disappearance of the inversion center, 
which leads to the emergence of symmetry-dependent physical properties, such

octahedral framework [M2O6] 40 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
as ferroelectric and nonlinear-optical. At the same time, the loss of the inversion 
center can occur with the preservation of the cubic structure (transition to the 
subgroups (F23, F4132, Fd3, F43m [3]) of the Fd3m group): Pb2Ir2O7–x (cubic 
symmetry, F43m) [4], KOs2O6 (cubic symmetry, F43m) [5], NH4NbWO6 (cubic 
symmetry, F43m) [6]); or with a change in symmetry to tetragonal: CsCuCuF6 
(I41/amd) [7], Rb0.91Nb0.96W1.04O5.98 (I 42d) [8], orthorhombic: CsNiNiF6 (Imma) 
[9], NH4CoAlF6 (Pnma) [10], Rb0.95Nb1.375Mo0.625O5.79 (Pnma) [11] or monoclinic 
symmetry: KCuCrF6 (P21/c) [12]. Oxygen-containing β-pyrochlores are less often 
characterized by symmetry below tetragonal and there are only a few such exam￾ples. In the series of β-pyrochlores CsTe2O6–x [13–15] depending on the value x the 
symmetry of the compound changes, including to orthorhombic and trigonal. 
The compound CsTaWO6 with the structure of β-pyrochlore undergoes a phase 
transition Fd3m → Pnma (cubic → orthorhombic) under increasing pressure 
[16]. Also, our research group previously obtained a series of solid solutions 
Rb0.95NbxMo2–xO6.475–0.5x (x = 1.31–1.625) with orthorhombic symmetry [11]. 
It should be noted that in addition to lowering symmetry, some phases with the β￾pyrochlore structure are characterized by a more complex elemental composition in 
the M position. Using the commonly accepted model for describing the β-pyrochlore 
structure, it is difficult to identify the reasons leading to non-standard stoichiometry in 
the M position (Rb8Nb11Mo5O46.5 [11]), the formation of oxygen defects (CsTe2O5.8 
[15]) or changes in the symmetry of the unit cell, which can be described by not only 
to cubic, but also to tetragonal, orthorhombic, trigonal and monoclinic symmetry. 
Therefore, to formalize changings of symmetry and stoichiometry, it is convenient 
to divide the unit cell of the A+M2O6 β-pyrochlore structure into two segments— 
layered and interlayer (Fig. 2.3 a). In this case, among the 16 M atoms in one unit 
cell, 12 will belong to the layer, and 4 will have an interlayer position, while one 
standard unit cell of β-pyrochlore with cubic symmetry Fd3m,Z = 8 corresponds 
to only 16 atoms (A8M16O48).
In general, the structure will consist of layers, perpendicular to the [111] direc￾tion, constructed from Z octahedra, which are connected into a three-dimensional 
framework through the vertices of X octahedra. These layers are shifted from each 
other by the vector −→N , which is determined by the dimensions of the “interlayer” 
octahedron (Fig. 2.3b). 
Therefore, the general formula can be written as A+ 
8X4Z12O48, where X and Z 
are different crystallographic positions (interlayer and layered, respectively), which 
can be occupied by different or the same atoms. Since atoms in positions X and Z can 
have different oxidation states, the electroneutrality of the elementary cell is achieved 
by changing the content of oxygen atoms (appearance of oxygen vacancies). Thus, 
one formula unit of the β-pyrochlore structure can be written as A+X0.5Z1.5O6–y. 
A similar model of describing β-pyrochlore within the framework of comparison 
with the layered structure of tungsten bronze was first presented in 1971 [18], but 
did not develop further (Fig. 2.4).
Similarly to the tungsten bronze structure, β-pyrochlore consists of layers, formed 
by six octahedra [MO6], arranged perpendicular to the [111] axis. In the case of the2 Structural Type of β-Pyrochlore Oxides AM2O6 41
Fig. 2.3 The unit cell of cubic β-pyrochlore A2M2O6 represented as a layered structure (a) [17]. 
Displacement vector −→N of layers relative to each other in the β-pyrochlore layer model for different 
projections (interlayer octahedral are highlighted) (b)
tungsten bronze structure, the layers are connected to each other through the vertices 
of the octahedra and are not shifted from each other. In the case of the β-pyrochlore 
structure, additional octahedra [MO6] are located between the layers. Such octahedra 
are connected through three vertices with each layer, between which they are located. 
Thus, it leads to the formation of the structural unit [M2O6]n. Layers of connected 
rings of 6 octahedra are displaced from each other by the vector −→V (Fig. 2.4a, b). The 
X-ray powder diffraction patterns of related structures of β-pyrochlore CsNbWO6 [2] 
and tungsten bronze CsCr1/3W8/3O9 [19] also have a common similarity (Fig. 2.4c). 
In summary, it can be said that the layered model allows us to consider the struc￾ture of β-pyrochlore as non-cubic with non-standard stoichiometry. This model as 
a special case also describes the cubic β-pyrochlore, where positions X and Z will 
be crystallographically indistinguishable. For example, the formula A+M5+M6+O6 
can be represented as A+(M5+ 
0.25M6+ 
0.25)(M5+ 
0.75M6+ 
0.75)O6, where ordering of M5+ 
and M6+ atoms in different positions does not occur, they can equally likely occupy 
both layers and interlayer space. It is typical for structures, where both atoms M5+ 
and M6+ are capable of forming a stable octahedral environment.42 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov

This method of redistributing positions 4–12 in the structure of β￾pyrochlore explains the emergence of complex stoichiometry in the pyrochlore￾like structures previously obtained in the world and in our scientific 
group: Rb0.95NbxMo2–xO6.475–0.5x (x = 1.31–1.625), Rb0.75Ta1.375Mo0.625O5.69, 
K8V6Te10O49, Rb8V7Te9O48.5, Cs8V6Te10O49 (formulas are given for the unit cell, 
Z = 8) [20], CsTe2O6 and CsTe2O5.75 [15]. 
Thus, the change in stoichiometry of compounds with the β-pyrochlore structure 
is associated with the inequivalent M positions in A+M2O6, and the decrease in 
symmetry begins with the selective occupation of X and Z positions of the model 
A+X0.5Z1.5O6–y (or A8X4Z12O48–y for the unit cell, Z = 8). To maintain the three￾dimensional framework of the structure, the position M (A+M2O6) must be fully 
or almost fully occupied by atoms capable of stable octahedral coordination (Nb5+, 
Ta5+, W6+, Te6+). The remaining part is occupied by atoms, prone to the formation 
of distorted octahedral coordination or to a smaller coordination number (Mo6+, 
V5+). It explains not only the presence of non-stoichiometry, but also its quantitative 
characteristics. The number of Mo6+, V5+ and Te4+ atoms in the above structures 
β-pyrochlore changes near 4, which corresponds to the number of X positions in the 
unit cell. 
At this point, a large number of phases with the β-pyrochlore structure have been 
obtained and studied (Table 2.2).
If you calculate the average radius ravg of the cation in the position M of β￾pyrochlore AM2O6, taking into account the stoichiometry of cations occupying this 
position, and arrange the existing phases in descending order of ravg, then the phases 
of β-pyrochlore can be conditionally divided into several areas: 
1. the range of values ravg ~ 0.58–0.6 Å, where β-pyrochlore phases for cations 
from Cs to Na have been prepared by solid-state synthesis; 
2. the range ravg < 0.58 Å, where β-pyrochlore phases predominantly for cations 
from Cs to K have been prepared by solid-state synthesis; 
3. the range ravg > 0.6 Å, where β-pyrochlore phases predominantly for cations 
from Cs to K(Rb) have been prepared by solid-state synthesis. 
It should be noted that the area of the structural type stability depends not only 
on cations in the M position, but also on cations in the A position. Thus, the solid￾state synthesis mainly allows to prepare β-pyrochlore structures for K, Rb, and Cs￾containing compounds, whereas a lot of structures containing Li and Na, as well 
as K, are obtained by the hydrothermal synthesis method. Moreover, in most cases, 
β-pyrochlore structure compounds containing Li and Na do not form.44 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov

2.2 Series of β-Pyrochlores with Composition 
A+M5+ xM6+ 
2–xO6 
The most studied β-pyrochlores is a group of compounds with the general formula 
A+M5+M6+O6, which belongs to the central area of Table 6 with raverage ~ 0.58–0.6 
Å. It is known, the most stable combination of atoms in M position of AM2O6 is 
cations in oxidation states 5+ (V5+, Nb5+, Ta5+, Sb5+) and 6+ (Mo6+, W6+, Te6+) with 
similar ionic radii and electronegativities. Thus, it leads to the formation of a large 
number of compounds with the structure of defective β-pyrochlore AM2O6. 
Such compounds occupy the most studied area of Table 6 and are characterized 
by cubic symmetry with space group Fd3m. They include well-studied compounds 
A+M5+WO6 (A+ = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; M5+ = Nb, Ta, Sb), A+M5+TeO6 (A+ = Na, K, 
Rb, Cs; M5+ = Nb, Ta, Sb) [18, 21, 22], where the hexavalent cation is represented2 Structural Type of β-Pyrochlore Oxides AM2O6 45
by ions W6+ (r = 0.6 Å) or Te6+ (r = 0.56 Å), which are capable of forming a stable 
octahedral environment. 
In addition, this area includes the combination of Sb–Mo atoms. The authors [23] 
report on the synthesis of compounds with the structure of β-pyrochlore ASbMoO6 
(A+ = Rb, Cs). However, according to the indicated synthesis scheme, we were 
unable to reproduce the samples. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the calcination 
product of a mixture of antimony (V), molybdenum (VI) and alkali metal nitrates 
contain characteristic for the structure of β-pyrochlore. However, the presence of 
impurity peaks was detected and not indicated in possible symmetry settings of 
pyrochlore. Also, the maximum intensity of the “β-pyrochlore” lines was achieved at 
the composition of the sample A+ 
2O·2Sb2O5, that is, in the absence of molybdenum. 
Although the average radius of the Sb–Mo pair corresponds raverage = 0.58–0.6 Å, 
in Table 6 the area of the β-pyrochlore structure formation for this combination is 
only noted formally. 
Above and below the area with an average radius ravg of the cation in position M ~ 
0.6 Å, there are phases that have been studied significantly less. The deviation of cubic 
symmetry is observed among them. Moreover, in some cases, such β-pyrochlores 
are characterized by a stoichiometry of the cation in position M, different from the 
classical one. 
Thus, most molybdenum-containing β-pyrochlores are located in areas with 
altered symmetry and stoichiometry. It is due to the fact that a more typical coordi￾nation environment for the Mo6+ cation r = 0.59 Å compared to W6+ is the square 
pyramid [MoO5] and tetrahedron [MoO4] [24]. Currently, several molybdenum￾containing phases A+M5+MoO6 (A+ =Rb, Cs; M5+ =Sb, Nb, Ta) with a β-pyrochlore 
structure are known [11, 20, 23]. The authors [25] mention the production of ceramics 
based on β-pyrochlores AI
MVMoO6 (AI = Na, K, Cs; MV = Nb, Ta), however, not 
all phases could be reproduced using the described synthesis methods. 
The structure study of the single crystals CsM5+MoO6 (M5+ = Nb, Ta) showed 
that the compounds belong to the structural type of defective β-pyrochlore and 
can be determined in two cubic space groups—centrosymmetric Fd3m and non￾centrosymmetric F43m with relatively low R-factor values, which is slightly less for 
F43m. Thus, to clarify the space group of CsM5+MoO6 (M5+ = Nb, Ta), an additional 
investigation was carried out in order to check the presence of an inversion center 
in the structure by studying nonlinear optical properties. It was established [26–28], 
that CsM5+MoO6 (M5+ = Nb, Ta) has the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal, 
and therefore belongs to the non-centrosymmetric F43m. The decrease in symmetry 
is associated only with the partly disordering of the oxygen environment of Nb and 
Mo atoms, while the metal atoms themselves practically do not shift from their ideal 
positions. 
These substances undergo phase transition F43m ↔ Fd3m above 400 °C. 
Several low-intensity reflections, belonged to F43m hk0 (h, k = 2n) and h00 (h 
= 2n) disappear, and the remaining reflections on the X-ray diffraction pattern 
are indexed in Fd3m [29]. Figure 2.5 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the 
compound CsNbMoO6. It can be seen that only the presence of a weak reflection46 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
Fig. 2.5 The X-ray diffraction patterns of CsNbMoO6 β-pyrochlore at room temperature (a) and 
change of reflections (133) and (420) intensities during heating up to phase transition (b) [11] 
(420) indicates its belonging to F43m, whereas other intense reflections are indexed 
in Fd3m. 
The authors [11] have shown that many β-pyrochlores undergo a similar phase 
transition, where the non-centrosymmetric space group changes to a centrosymmetric 
one upon heating the crystals. 
Based on the transition temperature, the compounds can be divided into two 
groups. The first includes β-pyrochlores with a phase transition temperature below 
room temperature, and at 25 °C they exist as centrosymmetric phases. These include 
tungstates AI
NbWO6 (AI = NH4, Rb, Cs, Tl) and AI
TaWO6 (AI = Tl, Rb). The 
second group of compounds undergoes a phase transition at heating above 100 °C, and 
at room temperature they exist as non-centrosymmetric phases. Such compounds are 
of great interest because the absence of an inversion center is a factor determining the 
presence of some useful physical properties: ferroelectric (KOs2O6 [5]), nonlinear￾optical (NH4NbWO6 [6], CsM5+MoO6 (M5+ = Nb, Ta) [26, 27]). 
Also, previously in our research group [11, 20, 28] it was shown that rubidium￾containing phases of β-pyrochlore based on the octahedral framework [(Nb/ 
Ta)MoO6] possess altered stoichiometry and orthorhombic symmetry (space group 
Pnma): Rb0.95NbxMo2–xO6.475–0.5x (x =1.31–1.625), Rb0.75Ta1.375Mo0.625O5.69. Such 
structures are oxygen-deficient, that is stabilized by Mo6+ atoms, which lose oxygen 
in the environment and form a more stable configuration for them [Mo6+O5] 
(Fig. 2.6a).
On the X-ray diffraction pattern of the orthorhombic β-pyrochlore phase, split￾ting of the (022), (113), (115), and (044) reflections is observed compared to cubic 
symmetry and space group Fd3m (Fig. 2.6b). 
The chemical formulas of the obtained solid solutions Rb0.95NbxMo2–xO6.475–0.5x 
(x = 1.31–1.625) with orthorhombic symmetry can be written as 
AX0.5Z1.5O6–y: Rb(Mo0.375Nb0.125)Nb1.5O5.66, Rb(Mo0.438Nb0.062)Nb1.501O5.70,

Rb0.95NbxMo2–xO6.475–0.5x (x = 1.31–1.625) solid solutions [11] 
the range x = 1.31–1.44 the amount of molybdenum is greater than the number of 
interlayer positions. Therefore, it is partially located in the layers of the structure. 
Such statistical occupancy by Nb and Mo atoms of the same position approaches 
the symmetry of the structure to cubic and can cause difficulties in indexing the 
X-ray diffraction pattern. Also, the point x = 1.5 has the number of molybdenum 
and niobium atoms, which match the number of non-equivalent positions, and can 
cause an increase in symmetry to tetragonal or pseudotetragonal. In the area of solid 
solutions around x = 1.5, indeed, there is a convergence of the unit cell parameters 
a and b, as well as a decrease in the value of the parameter c (Fig. 2.7). 
Thus, the disorder of M5+ and M6+ atoms in positions X and Z is preserved, when 
the symmetry reduction occurs only within cubic symmetry. For example, in the case 
of the Cs(Nb/Ta)MoO6 octahedral framework [(Nb5+/Ta5+)/Mo6+] is characterized 
by the presence of geometric distortions, however, Nb and Mo atoms do not order 
in the X and Z positions, as in the case of Rb0.95NbxMo2–xO6.475–0.5x (x = 1.31– 
1.625). Large Cs atoms stabilize the crystal structure, and the symmetry reduction 
occurs only within the cubic symmetry to the space group F43m, associated with 
the displacement of O atoms from the 48f position (space group Fd3m). 
In the series A+VM6+O6 (A+ = K, Rb, Cs; M6+ = W, Mo, Te) only the structures 
of compounds A+VTeO6–x (A+ = K, Rb, Cs) have been investigated. The unit cell 
parameters of the CsVTeO6 were established by the X-ray single crystal diffrac￾tion analysis [30], while K and Rb-containing analogs have altered stoichiometry 
K8V6Te10O49 and Rb8V7Te9O48.5 and were studied by the X-ray powder diffraction 
analysis [20]. It should be noted that in the case of β-pyrochlores K8V6Te10O49, 
Rb8V7Te9O48.5, and Cs8V6Te10O49 [20] the oxygen content is calculated taking into 
account the highest oxidation states of the elements. However, as our research shows, 
the formation of oxygen vacancies is likely both due to the transition of Te6+ →
Te4+ with the formation of polyhedra [Te4+O5], and due to the formation by V5+ 
atoms of more stable coordination polyhedra [V5+O5]. In addition, our research 
group has obtained phases of cubic β-pyrochlore (Fd3m) with compositions (Rb/ 
Cs)V3+ 
0.125V5+ 
0.625Te6+ 
1.25O6, where the valence states of atoms were determined 
by the method of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [31]. Apparently, Te6+ forms a2 Structural Type of β-Pyrochlore Oxides AM2O6 49
more stable octahedral environment, which allow the structure preservation, while 
part of the vanadium is reduced. Moreover, oxygen vacancies with such a ratio of V 
and Te atoms in the structure will no longer be observed. 
Also in the Te–V system, compounds (Na, K)VTeO5 (orthorhombic Pnma) are 
known, however they do not belong to the β-pyrochlore structure [32]. 
The greater stability of the pairs V5+–Te6+ compared to V5+–W6+ and V5+–Mo6+, is 
probably related to the proximity of their ionic radii, which determines the possibility 
of forming an octahedral framework. In the case of the combination V5+–W6+ at the 
moment only one representative of β-pyrochlore CsVWO6 is known, and the structure 
was refined by the X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis [2]. 
Despite the fact that the combination of cations V5+–Mo6+ in the M position gives 
an average radius, falling within the above ranges, β-pyrochlore phases were not 
detected [33]. Probably, this combination is unstable due to a greater tendency to 
form a square-pyramidal or tetrahedral coordination environment, which leads to the 
destabilization of the octahedral framework of the β-pyrochlore structure. 
2.3 Series of β-Pyrochlores with Composition 
A+M0.5 4+M1.5 6+O6 
A combination of +4 and +6 cations in the M position of the AM2O6 β-pyrochlore 
structure rarely realizes, because the physical parameters of such atoms usually differ 
more than for M5+ and M6+. Thus, it leads to more noticeable and serious distortions 
of the crystal structure. In such compounds, the ratio of cations in the M position 
often deviates from 1:1 due to retaining the unit cell electroneutrality. For example, 
previously the structures of such β-pyrochlores AM4+ 
0.5M6+ 
1.5O6 (A = K, Rb, Cs, 
Tl; M4+ = Ti, Zr, Hf, Ge, Rh; M6+ = W, Te) were obtained and studied in [34–36]. 
These compounds have cubic symmetry with Fd3m, probably because the cations 
W6+/Te6+ (r(W6+) = 0.6 Å, r(Te6+) = 0.56) and Ti4+/Zr4+/Hf4+ (r(Ti4+) = 0.605 
Å, r(Zr4+) = 0.72 Å, r(Hf4+) = 0.71 Å, r(Ge4+) = 0.53 Å, r(Rh4+) = 0.6 Å) have 
close ionic radii and form a stable octahedral environment. Thus, the β-pyrochlore 
structure is stabilized, and there is no ordering by X and Z positions. 
A particular case of such cation distribution is the occupation of the M position 
with the same element, but in different oxidation states (+4 and +6). For example, 
Te4+ and Te6+ cations can simultaneously occupy the M position in A+M2O6, as 
shown in the β-pyrochlores CsTe2O6–x (x = 0–1.5) [14, 15]. The β-pyrochlore 
CsTe0.5 
4+Te1.5 
6+O6 with trigonal symmetry and space group R3m [15] is formed 
at x = 0. The tellurium atoms Te(1) and Te(2) are ordered in different crystallo￾graphic positions 9e and 18g in the structure. Analysis of bond lengths shows that 
position 18g is occupied by Te6+ atoms (Te(2)-O 1.890(3)–1.9370(14) Å), and posi￾tion 9e—by Te4+ (Te(1)-O 2.107(4) Å). The ratio of Te6+:Te4+ = 3:1 corresponds 
to the ratio of layered and interlayer positions of tellurium atoms in the unit cell. 
Thus, tellurium Te6+ atoms in position 18g form layers, and tellurium Te4+ atoms50 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
in position 9e are located between the layers as octahedra [Te4+O6] and connect the 
layers into a three-dimensional framework (Fig. 2.8a).
At x = 0.2, the compound becomes CsTe0.5 
4+(Te1.3 
6+Te0.2 
4+)O5.8, and the 
symmetry changes to the classical for β-pyrochlore—cubic with space group Fd3m 
[13]. There is only one crystallographic position for Te atoms—octahedral position 
16c (Fig. 2.8a). Thus, a decrease in the occupancy of the oxygen atom position in 
the trigonal structure CsTe2O6-x leads to an increase in the symmetry of the structure 
to cubic and disordering of Te6+ and Te4+ atoms. At the same time, part of Te6+ 
reduces to Te4+ due to the appearance of oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies 
stabilize the β-pyrochlore structure, as Te4+ has a lone electron pair and forms more 
stable defective octahedra [Te4+O5]. The oxygen atom vacancy most likely occurs 
between a pair of bonded Te4+ atoms, which, losing one common oxygen, form 
groups [Te4O10] (Fig. 2.8a). 
Further reduction of oxygen content to x = 0.25 leads to a change in symmetry 
to orthorhombic and ordering of Te(1) and Te(2)/Te(3) atoms at positions 4a and 4c, 
as well as an increase in the number of Te4+ atoms: CsTe0.5 
4+(Te1.25 
6+Te0.25 
4+)O5.75 
(Pnma) [13]. It leads to the formation of ordered chains of octahedra [Te4+O6] and 
defective octahedra [Te4+O5], passing through the layers (Fig. 2.8a). 
The CsTe0.5 
4+(Te0.35 
6+Te1.15 
4+)O4.85 structure retains orthorhombic symmetry at x 
= 1.15, but the Te4+ content increases and the symmetry of the space group decreases 
to Pna21 (Fig. 2.8a) [15]. Despite the preservation of the general motif of the β￾pyrochlore structure, the tellurium Te4+ atoms amount becomes significant and leads 
to a significant loss of some oxygen. The ordering of Te6+ and Te4+ atoms in layers 
and chains disappears, and 8 non-equivalent positions of tellurium atoms appear. 
The tendency to form oxygen vacancies in the β-pyrochlore structure continues 
up to x = 1.5: CsTe2 
4+O4.5 (tetragonal symmetry, space group I 42d) [14], where all 
tellurium atoms have an oxidation state of Te4+ and the framework consists of linked 
tetrahedra [TeO4] (Fig. 2.8b). Further, the formation of the β-pyrochlore structure 
becomes unfavorable, as the number of oxygen atoms becomes insufficient to build 
a stable polyhedral three-dimensional framework. 
In the case of replacing Cs with Rb, a single pyrochlore-like structure Rb4Te8O23 
(orthorhombic symmetry, space group Pna21) [37], fully isostructural to Cs4Te8O23 
[14], forms. The size of rubidium atoms is smaller and the octahedral framework 
of the β-pyrochlore structure, built on Te atoms in two oxidation states, becomes 
unstable, so some of octahedra [TeO6] are replaced by square pyramids [TeO5]. 
Therefore, the phase Rb4Te8O23 was synthesized earlier only by the hydrothermal 
method, which allows obtaining the compound under mild conditions. It was not 
possible to obtain this compound by the solid-state method in either the cubic or 
rhombohedral form. 
When in the crystal structure of β-pyrochlore CsTe0.5 
4+Te1.5 
6+O6 with trigonal 
symmetry, part of Te6+ is replaced by atoms W6+, structural changes occur similar to 
the loss of part of oxygen atoms (x = 0.2) [17, 38, 39]. When 0 < x < 0.125 the struc￾ture of β-pyrochlore, apparently, is not stable and a mixture of phases CsTe2O4.5 
and CsTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Wx)O6 is formed. In the range x = 0.13–0.55 compounds

by X-ray diffraction analysis. The replacement of Te part with W leads to the disorder 
of atoms Te6+, W6+ and Te4+ in the 16c position of cubic Fd3m, which is the similar 
to the loss of oxygen atoms with the formation of cubic β-pyrochlore CsTe2O5.8. 
However, the W presence does not lead to oxygen vacancies appearance and redis￾tribution oxidation states between Te4+ and Te6+. Probably, it is due to the larger size 
of atoms W6+ compared to Te6+, which form stronger chemical bonds with oxygen 
atoms. 
In the range of x = 0.55–1.5 (CsTe0.5 
4+(Te0.95 
6+W0.55 
6+)O6) a mixture of β￾pyrochlore phase and compound Cs2TeW3O12 is formed [40]. The formula of the 
additional phase can be written as CsTe0.5 
4+W1.5 
6+O6. It can be seen that this 
compound is formally a point of the series CsTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5-x 
6+Wx)O6 at x = 1.5, when 
all Te6+ is replaced by W6+. The crystal structure Cs2TeW3O12 does not belong to the 
β-pyrochlore structure type, however, it has similarity with it (Fig. 2.9). The structure 
of Cs2TeW3O12 is layered, each layer consists of rings of 6 octahedra [W6+O6] and 
has a form similar to the layer structure of β-pyrochlore. Each ring on one side is 
connected to 3 blocks [Te4+O3], which represent a tetrahedron, where one oxygen 
position is occupied by lone electron pair of Te4+. In the interlayer space, only atoms 
Cs+, connecting the layers together, are located.
Probably, the increase in the number of large atoms W6+ in the rings of octa￾hedra [W6+/Te6+O6] in the β-pyrochlore CsTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Wx)O6 leads to geometric 
changes and an increase in the distance between layers. At a critical amount of tung￾sten, the distance between these layers becomes large enough, and atoms Te4+ in the 
interlayer space move away from one of the layers at a distance, where formation of 
chemical bonds becomes impossible (~3 Å). Since atoms Te4+ are capable of stable 
tetrahedral coordination, the structure does not destroy, but transitions to a more 
stable configuration. Thus, the octahedra [Te4+O6], which connected the layers into 
a three-dimensional framework of β-pyrochlore, are destroyed. A structure similar 
to the tungsten bronze arises, however, its layers are shifted relative to each other by 
the vector −→N , as in the case of the β-pyrochlore structure. 
In the case when atoms Te6+ are replaced by Mo6+, a similar disordering of 
atoms Te4+, Te6+ and Mo6+ in one position in the structure of CsTe2O6 occurs. 
Atoms Mo6+ also stabilize the oxygen environment, and oxygen vacancies do not2 Structural Type of β-Pyrochlore Oxides AM2O6 53

arise. Solid solutions of β-pyrochlores with cubic symmetry and space group Fd3m 
CsTe 0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Mox)O6 (x = 0.875–1.06) is formed. However the range of x is 
narrower, than for W-containing analogies, which, probably, is related to less stability 
of Mo6+ octahedra compared to W6+. At x < 0.875 the formation of the β-pyrochlore 
structure does not occur [17]. 
At x > 1.06 a series of solid solutions CsTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Mox)O6 is also inter￾rupted. However, at x ~ 1.5 the phase of Cs2TeMo3O12 (hexagonal, P63) is formed, 
that is isostructural to the compound Cs2TeW3O12, and corresponds to the composi￾tion of solid solutions at x = 1.5: CsTe0.5 
4+Mo1.5 
6+O6 [41]. Thus, at a certain amount 
of molybdenum atoms in the structure, the presence of Te6+ atoms in layers becomes 
a destabilizing factor. The structure preservation is possible only with the complete 
replacement of Te6+ with Mo6+, which leads to geometric changes and the destruction 
of interlayer octahedra [Te4+O6] with the formation of pyramids [Te4+O3], connected 
only with one layer. 
Structural changes in the solid solutions RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Wx)O6 (x = 0.25– 
0.63) and RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Mox)O6 (x = 0.5–0.75) have a similar nature, however, 
they are significantly influenced by the nature of the cation A+. Since the β-pyrochlore 
structure can be considered as layered, the more evenly the positive charge is 
distributed in the “interlayer” space (ions A+ polarize the layers weakly), the more 
stable structure should be formed. When transitioning from Cs+ to Rb+, the atom size 
decreases while maintaining the charge, therefore, Cs+ ions polarize “layers” less, 
than Rb+. At the same time, Li+, Na+ and K+ ions polarize “layers” more strongly 
than Cs+ and Rb+, therefore compounds with a β-pyrochlore structure in their case54 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
are rarely formed by the solid-state reaction, and sometimes they can be obtained 
only by ion exchange. 
The octahedral framework [Te4+/Te6+O6/5] of the compound 
RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.25 
6+Te0.25 
4+)O5.75 [37] is not stable enough due to the loss of 
some oxygen atoms and a high content of large atoms Te4+. However, the replace￾ment of some Te6+ with W6+ or Mo6+ stabilizes the oxygen environment of the 
octahedral framework, compensates for the polarizing ability of Rb+, and leads 
to the Te4+/Te6+/W6+ or Te4+/Te6+/Mo6+ atoms disorder in one crystallographic 
position. Thus, the solid solutions RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Wx)O6 (x = 0.25–0.63) and 
RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Mox)O6 (x = 0.5–0.75) crystallize in the cubic symmetry with 
space group Fd3m, as shown by X-ray diffraction analysis. When x < 0.25 and x < 
0.5 for RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Wx)O6 and RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Mox)O6, respectively, the 
β-pyrochlore structure does not form [17]. 
In the case of x > 0.625, the solid solutions RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Wx)O6 (x = 0.25– 
0.63) also terminates. At x ~ 1.5 a ternary compound Rb2TeW3O12 (trigonal, space 
group P31c) forms [40], which corresponds to the point x = 1.5 of the solid solu￾tions RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Wx)O6 (x = 0.25–0.63), and is also a structural analogue of 
CsTe0.5 
4+(W/Mo)1.5 
6+O6. In the case of RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Mox)O6 (x = 0.5–0.75) 
a similar compound at x = 1.5 does not form. Apparently, the size of the rubidium 
atoms and their polarizing ability in combination with a less stable octahedral frame￾work of [Mo6+O6] destabilizes the structure. It explains the fact that at x > 0.75 in 
solid solutions RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Mox)O6 (x = 0.5–0.75) an amorphous phase is 
formed [17]. 
By the hydrothermal synthesis method, the authors [42] obtained a ternary 
compound Rb4Mo6Te2O24·6H2O (monoclinic, P21/c), which has the stoichiometry 
at x = 1.5. However, its crystal structure significantly differs from the β-pyrochlore 
and the analogue CsTe0.5 
4+Mo1.5 
6+O6. 
Figure 2.10 summarizes and clearly presents the changes in the crystal structure 
that occur with the variating of the W/Mo content in the obtained solid solutions 
RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Wx)O6 (x = 0.25–0.63), CsTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Wx)O6 (x = 0.13– 
0.55), RbTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Mox)O6 (x = 0.5–0.75) and CsTe0.5 
4+(Te1.5–x 
6+Mox)O6 (x 
= 0.875–1.06). When changing x in these systems, the number of Te4+ atoms remains 
the same and corresponds to the number of interlayer positions of the β-pyrochlore 
structure. Therefore, it can be assumed that the Te4+ atoms in the cubic β-pyrochlores 
we obtained also selectively occupy the interlayer position.
Considering the structural transformations on the example of systems CsTe2O6–x 
(x = 0–1.5) and CsTe4+ 
0.5(MVI xTe6+ 
1.5–x)O6 (x = 0–1.5, MVI = Mo, W), using the 
layered model A+X0.5Z1.5O6–y (X—layer positions, Z—interlayer positions), allows 
to represent the chain of transformations of the β-pyrochlore crystal structure and the 
ordering of atoms by positions, as well as to explain the violation of stoichiometry 
even in cubic Te-containing β-pyrochlores withFd3m. 
Thus, the crystallochemical analysis of compounds showed that the structural type 
of β-pyrochlore is stable within a wide range of composition changes in positions 
A and M (AM2O6). The occupation of the octahedral framework by atoms with2 Structural Type of β-Pyrochlore Oxides AM2O6 55

different size and physical characteristics gradually leads to a series of sequential 
distortions of the crystal structure of the ideal β-pyrochlore: 
(1) displacement of oxygen atoms from the general position 48f to the special 192i, 
96h, 96g, and 32e; 
(2) the symmetry reduction of the space group within the cubic system; 
(3) change of the cubic system to less symmetrical ones, accompanied by the 
appearance of ordered chains of octahedra built by the atoms of different types. 
At any stage of distortion, serious changes in the stoichiometric composition and 
the appearance of oxygen vacancies can be observed, if this is required for the stabi￾lization of the β-pyrochlore structure. This type of distortion is most characteristic 
for structures, which contain atoms capable of square-pyramidal or tetrahedral coor￾dination, as this compensates for the stress due to the formation of oxygen defects. 
Using the layered representation AI
X0.5Z1.5O6–y, changes in the symmetry of the 
β-pyrochlore structure can be represented as AI
(X + Z)O6-y (cubic, where positions 
X and Z are crystallographically indistinguishable) → AI
X0.5Z1.5O6–y (non-cubic). 
2.4 Series of β-Pyrochlores with Composition 
A+M0.33 3+M1.67 6+O6, A+M0.25 2+M1.75 6+O6 
and CsLi0.2W1.8O6 
Information about such β-pyrochlores is relatively scarce. The largest family of 
compounds among them is the series A+M0.33 
3+M1.67 
6+O6, where the M position 
is partially occupied by atoms in oxidation states 3+ and 6+. Known representatives 
of this series crystallize in the classical cubic symmetry with Fd3m, they include56 D. G. Fukina and E. V. Suleimanov
Fig. 2.11 Schematic 
diagram of 5s state in 
electron structure of Cs 
M0.33 3+Te1.67O6 [44] 
a large group CsM0.33 
3+Te1.67O6 (M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ga, Sc, In, Tl, Lu, Yb, 
Tm, Er, Ho), CsM0.33W1.67O6 (M = Cr, Fe, Sc, Y, G) [43, 44]. It can be noted that 
the unit cell parameters of such compounds are noticeably smaller than those of the 
classical β-pyrochlores. 
The presence in the β-pyrochlore structure of elements in the oxidation state 
3+ strongly affects the electronic structure due to the increase of occupied 5s 
states, change of their energy relative to the conduction band, and increase of elec￾tron mobility on these 5s levels. The authors [43, 44] found that the compounds 
CsM0.33 
3+Te1.67O6 (M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ga, Sc, In, Tl, Lu, Yb, Tm, 
Er, Ho) exhibit electrical conductivity at room temperature. The conductivity in 
such compounds compared to β-pyrochlores AM5+M6+O6 and AM0.5 
4+M1.5 
6+O6, 
increases due to the reduction in the unit cell size and the mixing of the M3+ 5s state 
with Te 5s (Fig. 2.11). The smaller size of the unit cell decreases the stabilization of 
5s electrons, captured by the conduction band. Whereas the size of the crystal lattice 
increases, they fall into a deep "trap" and conductivity at room temperature is no 
longer observed. 
When the M position is occupied by atoms with an oxidation state of 2+, the 
β-pyrochlore structure can also form, but only a few compositions are known in the 
literature CsM0.25 
2+Te1.75O6 (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Mn, Co, Cu) [45, 46]. All of them are 
characterized by a classic cubic symmetry with space group Fd3m. As in the case 
of A+M0.33 
3+M1.67 
6+O6, the main interest in their production was associated with the 
possibility of the electronic structure control. It has been shown that the presence in 
the crystal structure of cations with partially filled d-sublevels (Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+, 
Cu2+) allows reducing the width of the band gap to ~2 eV, that is, shifting it from 
UV to the visible range of light. 
Nowadays only one compound with β-pyrochlore structure AM2O6, where the 
M position is occupied by a monovalent cation—Cs(Li0.2Te1.8)O6, was found [45, 
46]. This compound is formed under solid-state synthesis conditions above 800 °C2 Structural Type of β-Pyrochlore Oxides AM2O6 57
and is characterized by classic cubic symmetry with space group Fd3m. At lower 
temperatures, the CsLiWO4 phase is more stable.

3.1 General Remarks on Photocatalysis 
The technological progress of the twentieth-twenty-first centuries has caused serious 
problems: the depletion of traditional non-renewable sources (oil, gas, coal) as well as 
environmental problems, primarily related to the greenhouse effect. These problems 
need to be solved by developing new renewable raw materials and energy sources, 
developing waste-free technologies, and using environmentally friendly types of 
fuels [1]. One of the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry, which was formulated 
in 1998 by P. T. Anastas and J. C. Warner in the book “Green Chemistry: Theory 
and Practice” [2], declares: “catalytic reagents (as selective as possible) are supe￾rior to stoichiometric reagent.” This approach to the implementation of chemical 
transformations includes the use of a full range of catalytic materials, reducing the 
energy barrier of the reaction [3]. At the same time, one of the most promising areas 
of research nowadays is the development of highly active heterogeneous photocat￾alysts for industrially important processes: water and air purification from organic 
substances; hydrogen evolution; oxidation of organic substrates (hydrocarbons and 
alcohols); reduction of CO2 with the production of methane, methanol, formic acid; 
biomass conversion; polymerization, etc. The study of the photocatalysis and the 
development of new effective photocatalytic systems can lead to solving problems 
associated with the need to replace non-renewable raw materials and energy sources 
with renewable ones, as well as significantly advance in reducing the concentration 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by capturing and further transforming it into 
value-added products. 
From a practical point of view, the most important aspect in the development of 
heterogeneous photocatalysts is their ability to effectively absorb solar irradiation.

At present, titanium dioxide is the most studied and popular photocatalytic material 
for many industrially important processes. Despite the fact that titanium dioxide 
has found practical application in water [4, 5] and air [6] purification, as well as 
for creating self-cleaning coatings [7], it belongs to wide-band-gap semiconductors 
(WBGSs) with the band gap (Eg) of 3.0–3.4 eV, which makes it possible to use only 
the ultraviolet (UV) region to initiate photocatalytic processes. solar energy that 
reaches the ground has around 5% UV light; the remaining energy is almost evenly 
divided between the visible and infrared light [8, 9]. Thus, for effective use of solar 
energy, the development of new active photocatalysts capable to absorb visible light 
irradiation as well as methods for shifting the photosensitivity of catalysts into the 
visible region are important directions in the theory and practice of heterogeneous 
photocatalysis. It is important to note that significant progress in photocatalysis is 
accompanied by the emergence of new and new scientific schools, the geography 
of which is the entire civilized world. An aspiration to comprehend the problem of 
photocatalytic action of solid materials reflects humanity’s desire for more rational 
use of those natural resources that it possesses. 
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an interdisciplinary field of science, arising at the 
intersection of photochemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, as well as, to a large extent, 
physics, and solid state chemistry. At the current stage of science development, 
photocatalysis is defined as “a change in the rate of chemical reactions or their 
generating under the action of light in the presence of the substances (photocatalysts) 
that absorb light quanta and are involved in the chemical transformations of the 
reaction participants, repeatedly coming with them into intermediate interactions 
and regenerating their chemical composition after each cycle of such interactions” 
[10, 11]. 
A photocatalytic process in general form can be written as follows: 
A + K + hν → B + K (3.1) 
A necessary condition for attributing a process to photocatalyzed is the unchanged 
chemical composition of the catalyst K at the end of the cycle of transformations, 
which distinguishes photocatalytic reactions from photochemical ones. The need for 
a clear distinction between the concepts of “photocatalysis” and “photochemistry” 
is due to the fact that light quanta are irreversibly consumed during the reaction, i.e., 
light cannot be considered as a catalyst/photocatalyst [12]. 
3.2 Historical Background of Photocatalysis 
The term “photocatalysis” first appeared in the scientific community in several publi￾cations in 1911. For instance, Eibner described a method for decolorizing solutions 
containing Prussian blue under the light in the presence of zinc oxide [13]. Simulta￾neously, it was established that uranyl salts UO2 
2+ are capable to photocatalyze the3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 63
decomposition of oxalic acid [14, 15], and later in 1921, the synthesis of formalde￾hyde from CO2 and H2O catalyzed by uranium salts and iron hydroxides was inves￾tigated [16]. The discovery of the photosensitivity of ZnO led to further research 
into the activity of this semiconductor material in various reactions, including the 
reduction of Ag+ to Ag0 [17]. In 1929, Kaidel first reported on the photocatalytic 
decomposition of aniline dyes in the presence of titanium dioxide [18]. Later, it was 
suggested that the presence of oxygen and UV irradiation could lead to the formation 
of active particles on the surface, which take direct part in the dyes decomposition 
[19]. In the 1930s, it was established that not only ZnO can photocatalyze the reduc￾tion of Ag+ to Ag0, but also other oxides and hydroxides, such as Al2O3, Al(OH)3, 
Y2O3, La2O3, Sm2O3, Er2 O3, CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, Ti(OH)4, Nb2O5, Bi2O3, WO3, 
CdO [20]. However, the lack of practical application of the results was the main factor 
that led to a loss of interest in this topic for several decades. Only in the 1960s, V. N. 
Filimonov presented the results of the photocatalytic oxidation of isopropanol over 
ZnO and TiO2 [21]. It was shown that isopropanol is oxidized to acetone by molecular 
oxygen under UV irradiation. Similar results were obtained in parallel by Japanese 
researchers [22, 23]. In the 1970s, researchers’ attention to the search for new alter￾native sources of raw materials and energy, including their production and processing 
using photocatalysis, increased significantly. The reason for this interest was the oil 
crisis of 1973, when all Arab members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC), as well as Egypt and Syria, announced that they would not supply 
oil to certain countries (UK, Canada, Netherlands, USA, Japan) for political reasons 
[24]. During such a complex economic and political situation in the world, Japanese 
scientists Fujishima and Honda published a paper [25], in which they reported the 
production of hydrogen by water splitting on a TiO2 photoelectrode. This research, 
which has more than 25,000 citations as of 2023, is rightfully considered the most 
important in the theory and practice of heterogeneous photocatalysis, as it showed 
not only the possibility of obtaining energy resources from cheap and environmen￾tally friendly raw materials, but also established the possibility of using sunlight to 
initiate water splitting, and also led to the emergence of numerous developments 
in the field of water and air purification, hydrogen evolution, and organics trans￾formation. Later, it was found that the incorporation of Pt atoms in the structure of 
semiconductors favorably affects their photocatalytic activity in water splitting [26]. 
Pt/TiO2 materials were also studied in the following decade as photocatalysts for 
hydrogen evolution from ethanol aqueous solutions [27]. It was shown that the main 
products of the reaction were methane and acetaldehyde in addition to H2. Moreover, 
in the 1980s, it was reported that perovskites (e.g., strontium titanate SrTiO3) with 
impregnated Pt also have the ability to act as photocatalysts for water splitting [28]. 
Thus, photocatalysis science, which has a history of more than a century, has 
accumulated a huge amount of knowledge over this period due to several equiva￾lent aspects. Firstly, humanity has been continuously striving to find new renewable 
energy sources since the beginning of the XX century, which can replace traditional 
ones based on fossil kysources. In this regard, the use of solar energy to stimulate 
chemical processes appears to be one of the most promising approaches. As early 
as 1912, it was predicted that methods using available and renewable solar energy64 A. S. Belousov
instead of harmful reagents would rapidly develop [29]. Research dedicated to the 
development of photocatalytic materials for the effective degradation of pollutants 
and the synthesis of important chemical products is at the forefront of chemical 
science today. Secondly, the study of photocatalysis is interdisciplinary, so the laws 
valid for each of the above-mentioned disciplines are also valid for photocatalytic 
transformations, thereby forming an understanding of the phenomena considered in 
this book. 
3.3 Fundamentals of Photocatalysis 
The mechanism of reactions involving a solid photocatalytic material includes several 
important stages, which are represented by Eqs. (3.2)–(3.4) and shown in Fig. 3.1. 
The energy spectrum of electrons in a solid consists of separate allowed energy 
bands—conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), which are separated by “for￾bidden energy” zones also known as band gap [32, 33]. Thus, the band gap of a 
material is defined as the difference in energy of the bottom of the conduction band 
and the top of the valence band (Fig. 3.1). 
When light is absorbed, the energy of which exceeds the width of the band gap of 
a photosensitive material (semiconductor, SC), an electron (e–) may pass from the 
VB to the CB, thereby generating a hole (vacancy, h+) in the VB (Eq. 3.2). Since in an 
ideal SC all states of the valence band are filled, and all states of the conduction band 
are free, the transfer occurs exactly in the direction shown in Fig. 3.1. The electron, 
after entering the excitation zone, becomes mobile and has significant reduction 
potential. In general, the electron can be considered as a strong reducing agent. The 
resulting hole is also quite mobile and is an oxidant [33]. After the separation of
Fig. 3.1 Simplified 
mechanism of heterogeneous 
photocatalysis [30] 3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 65
the electron and hole, either the electron is transferred back to the VB, leading to 
the regeneration of the semiconductor (Eq. 3.3), or the electron–hole pair enters into 
redox reactions with molecules adsorbed on the surface (Eq. 3.4): 
SC + hν → SC ∗

CB) → SC + hν/heat (3.3) 
SC ∗
(
h+
VB + e−
CB)
+ A + C → SC +• A− +• C+ (3.4) 
The possibility of reactions (3.2)–(3.4) being carried out is determined by the 
mutual arrangement of the corresponding redox potentials and the boundaries of the 
forbidden zone [34]. The photocatalytic process can only occur when the electron 
acceptor (A/•
A–) has a reduction potential lower than the lower boundary of the 
conduction band, and the electron donor (C/•
C+), oxidized by the excited photocata￾lyst, must have energy higher than the upper boundary of the valence band as shown 
in Fig. 3.2 using CO2 reduction as an example. 
In addition to the mutual arrangement of the corresponding redox potentials and 
the boundaries of the forbidden zone, a critically important factor is the wavelength 
(Fig. 3.3). The wavelength should be such that the energy of the photon exceeds the 
band gap (h is Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of the photon, c is the speed of 
light): 
hν = hc 
λ
> Eg (3.5)

(redox potentials are indicated according to [35–37] 66 A. S. Belousov
Fig. 3.3 Comparison of light intensity and wavelength of different light sources 
Currently, the development of highly active photocatalytic materials capable of 
effectively absorbing visible radiation is one of the most complex, but no less impor￾tant and relevant tasks in the theory and practice of heterogeneous photocatalysis. 
It should be noted that the influence of the forbidden zone width on the photocat￾alytic activity of the material is not unambiguous. Thus, the width of the forbidden 
zone determines the action spectrum of the sensitizer: the smaller the value of Eg 
the longer the wavelength it is capable of absorbing, as shown in Fig. 3.3. It can be 
seen that materials with Eg <3.0 eV are needed to absorb visible light, and wider￾zone photocatalysts show activity only in the presence of UV light [1]. On the other 
hand, an increase in E g usually leads to an increase in quantum efficiency, which is 
expressed in an increase in the rate of the photocatalytic reaction while maintaining 
the condition hν >Eg [38]. 
The third aspect, determining the planning of synthesis using a heterogeneous 
semiconductor photocatalyst, is considered to be the conversion of temporary charge 
separation into an irreversible and selective chemical reaction. The desired course of 
the photocatalytic process is to prevent the recombination of the electron–hole pair 
and the transfer of the electron (hole) across the solid–liquid or solid–gas interface 
and subsequent redox reactions.3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 67
3.4 Parameters for Evaluating Photocatalytic Activity 
The main parameter for evaluation of the activity of photocatalysts in various 
processes is considered to be the specific activity ((mol of product)·h–1·gcat –1): 
A = n 
t · mcat 
, (3.6) 
where n is the amount of product formed, mol; t is the reaction time, h; mcat is the 
photocatalyst amount. 
However, due to the dependence of the product formation rate on the light nature 
and intensity supplied to the system, the use of this parameter is not entirely correct. It 
seems appropriate to compare the specific activity of photocatalysts, which are tested 
under the same conditions. The problem of a correct quantitative description of the 
action of photocatalytic material is described in detail in the IUPAC recommendations 
[39], where it is indicated that special attention should be paid to such parameters as 
the turnover number (TON), quantum yield, and action spectrum. 
The turnover number of the catalyst is determined by the Eq. (3.7): 
TON = number of reacted molecules 
number of active catalyst centers (3.7) 
However, it is often unknown what the active centers of the photocatalyst repre￾sent, so the total number of atoms in the photocatalyst is used in the denominator of 
Eq. (3.7). 
The quantum yield, which is found using the number of photons falling on the 
system, in accordance with the IUPAC recommendations, is commonly referred to 
as quantum efficiency (QE) [39] and is calculated by the following Equation: 
QE = number of reacted (or released) molecules 
number of photons that fell on the system . (3.8) 
The action spectrum of the photocatalyst is the dependence of the chemical 
photoresponse (quantum yield) on the wavelength or energy. Analysis of this param￾eter is necessary to assess the photosensitivity of the material to different wavelength 
ranges, especially to visible light. However, it is known that many processes can 
occur in the presence (and even without) catalysts and in the dark, so to distinguish 
between dark and light stages when studying photocatalytic reactions, it is necessary 
to conduct “blank” experiments, i.e., without a photocatalyst and light.68 A. S. Belousov
3.5 Reactive Oxygen Species Formed During Photocatalysis 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) include oxygen ions, free radicals (small molecules 
with exceptional reactivity due to the presence of an unpaired electron) and perox￾ides of both inorganic and organic nature [31, 40]. Four main ROS are distin￾guished, which can form and undergo further transformations during the photo￾catalytic process: superoxide radical •
O2 
–, hydrogen peroxide H2O2, singlet oxygen 
1O2 and hydroxyl radical •
OH. It should be noted that the reaction mixture may also 
contain and generate organic peroxide radicals ROO•
, nitrosyl radical •
NO and ozone 
O3. The formation and detection of the last three ROS mainly depend on the type of 
photocatalytic reaction and its conditions. 
Superoxide radical •
O2 
–. It is formed by the reduction of molecular oxygen by 
conduction-band electrons: 
O2 + e− →• O−
2 (3.9) 
The amount of superoxide radical formed is linearly dependent on the number of 
generated electrons, which was confirmed by the electron paramagnetic resonance 
(EPR) method at 77 K for various TiO2 powders [41]. Moreover, the rate of •
O2 
– 
formation significantly varies for different phases of titanium dioxide. Thus, it was 
shown that the use of rutile leads to the formation of superoxide as the main product 
in an aqueous medium containing 2-propanol [42]. On the contrary, in the presence of 
anatase the main ROS is hydrogen peroxide, which is explained by the higher photo￾catalytic activity of anatase powders. In turn, the higher activity of TiO2 (anatase) 
may be due to a higher density of surface defects, which depends on the powder 
preparation method. Another important factor affecting the rate of •
O2 
– formation is 
the size of the powder particles, with an increase in the number of which the amount 
of generated superoxide radical increases [43]. The formation of superoxide was also 
noted in the presence of other semiconductors [44, 45]. 
Another route of the •
O2 
– formation is the disproportionation of hydrogen 
peroxide: 
H2O2 + h+ →• O−
2 + 2H+ (3.10) 
Further transformation involving superoxide radical includes its disproportiona￾tion with the formation of H2O2. 
The hydroperoxyl radical •
O2H, the protonated form of •
O2 
–, is formed as a result 
of reaction (3.12): 
•
O−
2 + H+ →• O2H (3.11) 
The superoxide radical exhibits relatively low activity when interacting with 
organic or inorganic molecules in an aqueous environment. However, •
O2 
– is char￾acterized by strong nucleophilic properties in aprotic organic solvents. Thus, it is3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 69
capable of actively interacting with alkyl halides to form dialkyl peroxides by the 
nucleophilic bimolecular substitution SN2 mechanism [46]:

Hydrogen peroxide H2O2. Among the detected ROS, hydrogen peroxide is the 
most stable compound. There are two ways of accumulating H2O2 in the reaction 
mixture. The first route involves the two-electron reduction of O2 with the inter￾mediate formation of superoxide radical by reaction (3.9). At this point, the further 
transformation of •
O2 
– can proceed either due to its disproportionation by reaction 
(3.11) or by reaction (3.16): 
•
O−
2 + 2H+ + e− → H2O2 (3.15) 
Another mechanism for the formation of hydrogen peroxide under photocatalytic 
conditions involves the oxidation of water by valence-band holes to hydroxyl radicals 
•
OH (3.17) with their subsequent dimerization (3.18): 
H2O + h+ →• OH + H+; (3.16) 
2•
OH → H2O2 (3.17) 
The process of hydrogen peroxide formation by the dimerization of hydroxyl 
radicals was experimentally confirmed by adding an •
OH absorber under anaerobic 
conditions, which led to a decrease in the amount of generated H2O2 [47]. 
The formed hydrogen peroxide can then be disproportionate with the formation 
of molecular oxygen and water: 
2H2O2 → O2 + 2H2O (3.18) 
Moreover, despite the relative stability of H2O2, it can be oxidized under photo￾catalytic conditions according to reaction (3.10) with the generation of •
O2 
–, signif￾icantly increasing with the increase in hydrogen peroxide concentration in the reac￾tion mass for both anatase and rutile [48, 49]. However, for reaction (3.20) involving 
hydrogen peroxide, the amount of generated hydroxyl radicals in the presence of 
TiO 2 depends on its phase: 
H2O2 + e− →• OH + OH− (3.19)70 A. S. Belousov
Thus, in the presence of anatase, a decrease in the amount of •
OH was noted with 
an increase in the concentration of H2O2, while for rutile, the trend of increasing 
accumulation of hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic process was maintained 
[49]. The formed hydroxyl radicals can interact with hydrogen peroxide according 
to reaction (3.21): 
H2O2 +• OH →• O−
2 + H2O + H+ (3.20) 
Further transformation of hydrogen peroxide occurs according to the Haber–Weiss 
reaction (3.22), where hydroxyl radical is generated: 
H2O2 +• O−
2 →• OH + O2 + OH− (3.21) 
This reaction proceeds quite slowly, but is catalyzed by iron ions: in the first stage, 
Fe3+ is reduced by the superoxide radical to form Fe2+, which then interacts with 
H2O2 in the Fenton reaction, generating •
OH [50]. 
Singlet oxygen 1O2. Apparently, singlet oxygen was first detected under heteroge￾neous photocatalysis conditions in [51] using 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane as a chemical 
trap when irradiating powders of silicon, aluminum, and magnesium oxides. Later, 
singlet oxygen was detected based on the observation of oxygen phosphorescence at 
a wavelength of 1270 nm when irradiating TiO2 in an aqueous suspension [52]. The 
authors also put forward the assumption that this active form of oxygen is formed 
during the oxidation of superoxide radical by valence-band holes: 
•
O−
2 + h+ →1 O2 (3.22) 
This mechanism was subsequently confirmed using various titanium dioxide 
powders, with no observed dependence of the singlet oxygen formation rate during 
photocatalysis on the crystalline phase of TiO2: anatase and rutile provided compa￾rable efficiency of 1O2 production [53]. It was also noted that singlet oxygen exhibits 
high reactivity toward some organic compounds, for example, olefins and amines 
[54]. 
Hydroxyl radical •
OH. It is characterized by the highest reactivity of all ROS, 
capable of interacting with most organic molecules and is considered the most effec￾tive oxidant not only for the degradation of organic compounds [40], but also for 
other photocatalytic processes [55]. 
The hydroxyl radicals can be formed on the surface of a metal oxide by 
photocatalytic oxidation of H2O by valence-band holes: 
OH− + h+ →• OH (3.23) 
Moreover, according to modern concepts, on the surface of metal oxides, including 
TiO2, there are two types of hydroxyl groups: terminal, coordinated with one Ti atom 
(Fig. 3.4, marked in blue), and bridging, coordinated with two Ti atoms (Fig. 3.4, 
marked in red) [56].3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 71
Fig. 3.4 Surface structure of 
titanium dioxide [57] 
Terminal OH groups have basic (electron-donating) properties, and bridging 
hydroxyl groups have acidic (electron-accepting) properties [58]. For terminal and 
bridging hydroxyl groups, the equilibria described by reactions (3.25) and (3.26) are 
valid: 
≡ Ti−OH + H+⇌ ≡ Ti−OH+
2 ; (3.24) 
Ti−O−−Ti + H+⇌[Ti−OH−Ti] (3.25) 
At the same time, reaction (3.25) can be written in another form, when there is a 
dissociation of adsorbed water on the surface of titanium dioxide: 
≡ Ti−OH ⇌ ≡ Ti+ + OH− (3.26) 
Other ROS involved in photocatalytic processes (ROO•

NO and O3). The ROO• 
radicals are formed during the photocatalytic organic transformations. Examples of 
these radicals are •
CH2OH, •
CH(OH)CH3, •
C(CH3)2OH, •
CH3 and •
CH2COOH, 
which are formed during the oxidation of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and acetic 
acid, respectively [59]. In the first stage of the ROO• formation, the oxidation of the 
organic molecule RH occurs by valence-band holes followed by the interaction of 
the formed radicals with oxygen: 
RH + h+ → R• + H+; (3.27) 
R• + O2 → ROO• (3.28) 
The nitrosyl radical •
NO along with nitrogen dioxide (IV), volatile organic 
compounds, surface ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides and dust particles 
are among harmful emissions. In the air, it slowly oxidizes to NO2:72 A. S. Belousov
2•
NO + O2 → 2NO2 (3.29) 
Removal of •
NO from the air using photocatalysis is one of the most important 
methods of purification. This reaction is used as a standard ISO 22197 test method 
[60]. In the process of removing nitric oxide (II) it is sequentially oxidized to HNO2, 
NO2 and HNO3, for instance, according to the following scheme [61]: 
•
NO +• OH → HNO2; (3.30) 
HNO2 +• OH → NO2 + H2O; (3.31) 
NO2 +• OH → HNO3⇌ NO−

Ozone O 3 is a strong oxidant, much more reactive than molecular oxygen. In the 
oxidation reactions of organic compounds involving ozone, organic and hydroxyl 
radicals are formed [55]: 
RH + O3 → R• +• OH + O2 (3.33) 
Ozone is more prone to reduction by conduction-band electrons compared to 
molecular oxygen, and the product of its reduction can undergo rapid decomposition 
to form •

3.6 The Most Common Photocatalysts 
Over the century-long history of photocatalysis, a vast number of diverse photocat￾alytic systems have been proposed. Nowadays, a research trend is the development 
of visible light-responsive photocatalysts. 
Titanium dioxide. Currently, the most common type of semiconductor photocat￾alysts are inexpensive transition metal oxides, among which titanium dioxide is the 
most studied. The widespread use of this material is also associated with its low 
toxicity, high efficiency, and stability [63, 64]. It is well known that in its pure 
form in nature, TiO2 occurs as rutile, anatase, and brookite minerals (the first two 
have a tetragonal structure, and the latter has a rhombic symmetry). Despite obvious 
achievements in the field of photocatalysis using titanium dioxide, the most signif￾icant limitation of TiO2 is its large band gap value for different crystalline phases3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 73
(anatase—3.2 eV, rutile—3.0 eV, brookite—3.4 eV), which makes it possible to use 
only the UV region to initiate photocatalytic processes [65–67]. 
One of the most interesting ways to increase the sensitivity of TiO2 to visible light 
is its surface modification by doping with metals such as Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd [68]; Au, 
Ag [69]; Ce [70]. Despite a significant increase in the activity of titanium dioxide 
in visible light, this procedure often leads to the leaching of the metal from the 
TiO2 surface and, as a result, deactivation of the photocatalyst. Deactivation in the 
case of using doped titanium dioxide can also be associated with the phenomenon 
of photocorrosion [71]. In addition, these photocatalytic materials are much more 
expensive compared to pure titanium dioxide due to the use of noble metals in some 
cases. To address issues related to the sensitivity of TiO2 to visible light, as well as 
to obtain cost-effective materials, an interesting method is doping with non-metals 
[72, 73]. 
Other metal oxides. In addition to TiO2, there is great interest in photocatalysis in 
using such oxides as ZnO [74], CeO2 [75], CuO [76], SnO2 [77], WO3 [78], Al2O3 
[79], Fe2O3 [80]. Typically, metal oxides, by analogy with titanium dioxide, can be 
classified as wide-band-gap semiconductors, which makes them mostly ineffective 
for absorbing visible light. However, there are methods for their modification (e.g., 
doping), the development and optimization of which can lead to the use of solar 
energy to initiate chemical transformations. The main advantages of photocatalysts 
based on metal oxides are their relatively low cost, ease of production, and stability 
[81]. 
Chalcogenides. Transition metal sulfides, especially CdS and ZnS, have been used 
for photocatalytic transformations for several decades [82]. Thus, cadmium sulfide is 
characterized by a band gap of 2.45 eV and, accordingly, is capable to absorb visible 
light with a wavelength of up to 520 nm [83]. This value of Eg, in turn, makes CdS 
one of the most commonly used semiconductor photocatalysts. 
Graphitic carbon nitride. This material, possessing semiconductor properties (Eg 
= 2.7 eV), attracts researchers’ attention due to its pronounced photocatalytic and 
luminescent properties, which may be promising for practical use [84]. Like graphite, 
g-C3N4 consists of layers of multi-atomic thickness, held together by van der Waals 
forces (Fig. 3.5).
Significant interest in the material is also due to the simplicity of its synthesis 
by thermal treatment of organic compounds with a high nitrogen content: melamine 
[86], cyanamide [87], dicyandiamide [88], urea [89] and other precursors [90]. 
Graphitic carbon nitride was first described and studied as a photocatalyst in 2009 
in water splitting [91]. Since then, a significant number of applications of this material 
in photocatalysis have been proposed, in particular for the degradation of organic 
pollutants in water [92], reduction of CO2 [93] and aromatic nitro compounds [94], 
oxidation of alcohols [95] and hydrocarbons [96]. 
However, unmodified g-C3N4 is characterized by a number of disadvantages that 
limit its application in photocatalytic processes, namely relatively low sensitivity to 
visible light and rapid recombination of electron–hole pairs, reducing its activity. The 
photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride can be improved by doping with 
metals (Fe, Ag, Co, Mn) or non-metals (O, B, S, P, F). Another important approach to74 A. S. Belousov

permission from Ref. [85]. Copyright 2020 Elsevier
modify g-C3N4 is to obtain hybrids with other semiconductors (TiO2, CdS, Bi2WO6) 
[97]. 
Metal–organic frameworks. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a rela￾tively new class of porous materials and have a modular structure, which results in 
a huge variety of possible structures [98, 99]. 
According to IUPAC terminology [100], MOFs are a coordination network with 
organic ligands, containing voids (pores). Due to the similarity of some textural 
and adsorption characteristics (three-dimensional framework, high degrees of crys￾tallinity and porosity) of zeolites and MOFs, the latter are often referred to as 
zeolite-like materials [101]. The composition of MOFs can be divided into two main 
components: secondary structural components (clusters or metal ions) and organic 
molecules that connect them to each other, forming porous structures. The combina￾tion of organic and inorganic structural elements in the MOF molecule allows for the 
creation of materials with unique properties. The ability to vary the porosity of the 
structure, topology, and elemental composition has made MOFs promising materials 
in recent years for: 
(a) the separation and purification of gases [102, 103]; 
(b) the adsorption and storage of various gases [101, 104]; 
(c) targeted drug delivery, including for cancer therapy [105, 106]; 
(d) creating a variety of catalysts, including photocatalysts, as they have the band 
gap value from 1.0 to 5.5 eV due to the structural nature of metal clusters and 
organic linkers [107]. 
Currently, a whole range of different methods for obtaining metal–organic 
frameworks is described, including traditional solvothermal and non-solvothermal 
synthesis, as well as microwave, electrochemical, mechanochemical, and sonochem￾ical methods. For the application of synthesized materials in heterogeneous catalysis 
and photocatalysis, the post-synthetic purification stage is a critically important step, 
as impurities can mimic the activity of the structure and significantly reduce adsorp￾tion capacity. The purification of the obtained structures is usually carried out by3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 75
treating them with a solvent. The choice of the solvent also greatly influences the 
formation of MOFs. During the synthesis of MOF-5, it was noted that the addition 
of triethylamine accelerates the reaction of terephthalic acid (organic linker) with 
zinc nitrate due to an increase in pH, which promotes the deprotonation of the acid 
[108]. In addition, the sources of active metallic centers also have a decisive influence 
during the solvothermal synthesis of MOF-5 and HKUST-1 [109]. It was found that 
the use of zinc and copper acetates leads to the formation of smaller crystals, which 
can be explained by changes in the rate of nucleation during crystallization. 
In general, the most common method of synthesis of MOFs is the traditional 
method. Non-solvothermal synthesis occurs below the boiling point of the solvent 
in open vessels at atmospheric pressure and does not require complex and expensive 
equipment. The classic scheme of this method includes the choice of salt (source of 
metal), organic linker, and solvent, selection of pH and temperature values, which 
allow to achieve the maximum yield of MOFs. This method has been used to synthe￾size many structures, including MOF-5 [108] and MOF-177 [110]. However, in most 
cases non-solvothermal synthesis does not provide high yields of MOFs, which leads 
to the widespread use of the solvothermal method, which occurs at the boiling point 
of the solvent or above it in autoclaves at elevated pressure. Solvothermal synthesis 
allows to achieve higher yields of MOFs and better crystallinity of the product. The 
advantages of this method also include the ability to fully control the synthesis condi￾tions over a long period, which ultimately leads to the reproducibility of the chosen 
methodology [98]. For instance, the most thermally stable MOF UiO-67 (decompo￾sition temperature—540 °C) is successfully synthesized by the solvothermal method 
using a solution of ZrCl4 and terephthalic acid in N,N-dimethylformamide [111]. 
The main disadvantage of MOFs is their relatively low thermal stability compared 
to other known catalytic systems [98], although there are materials stable at temper￾atures up to 500 °C [112]. On the other hand, this disadvantage is not critical for 
photocatalytic processes, since they can occur under mild conditions (temperature 
up to 30 °C, atmospheric pressure). During photocatalysis, each metallic cluster in 
MOF can act as a quantum dot, where electrons and holes are generated, and the 
organic linker plays the role of a light-harvesting “antenna”. This effect has led 
to a rapid increase in publications dedicated to the application of MOFs in photo￾catalysis (water splitting, water purification from pollutants and synthesis of organic 
substances). 
A key driver of researchers’ interest in these materials is also the launch of 
their mass production by MOF Technologies and Numat Technologies in 2013– 
2016 [113, 114]. At present, the number of MOF manufacturers has significantly 
increased (Table 3.1). In addition, many MOFs are characterized by a smaller band 
gap compared to classic semiconductors (Table 3.2), and the creation of hybrid 
materials allows to obtain a narrow-band-gap material or provides effective charge 
separation [114].
Complex oxides. Among complex oxides, perovskite oxides and pyrochlore oxides 
have gained the most commonly used as photocatalysts. The classification, structure, 
and properties of pyrochlore oxides are described in detail in Chaps. 1 and 2.76 A. S. Belousov

The active use of perovskites in photocatalysis began in the late 1980s when 
the ability of niobate K4Nb6O17 to decompose water under UV light with a quantum 
efficiency of 3.5%, surpassing all known analogs at that time [130]. The high activity 
of this complex oxide was explained by the layered structure, which subsequently 
became a driver for active research of photocatalytic properties of other layered 
perovskite oxides [1, 131]. 
Among the main disadvantages of both pyrochlores and perovskites, the following 
can be highlighted: 
1. Many synthesized materials have the wide band gap (Table 3.3), which causes 
them to absorb light only in the ultraviolet region.3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 77

of pyrochlores and perovskites to visible light, as well as their photocatalytic activity, 
remains one of the main tasks at the present time.78 A. S. Belousov

3.7 Strategies for Enhancing Photocatalytic Activity 
Among the known methods used to improve the activity of semiconductors in visible 
light, the following should be highlighted: optimization of the synthesis method; 
photosensitization using metal nanoparticles; creation of heterojunctions, promoting 
spatial charge separation; band gap engineering, in particular non-metal doping. In 
the case of perovskites and pyrochlores band gap engineering, i.e., its control and 
modification, can be performed not only by introducing non-metal atoms into their 
structure, but also by replacing cations with other metals. 
Optimization of the synthesis method. From the point of view of industrial applica￾tion of any photocatalyst, a critically important aspect is the simplicity of its produc￾tion method, ensuring low energy and capital costs. On the other hand, the photo￾catalyst should provide excellent performances (conversion and yield of the target 
product), in connection with which special attention is currently paid to the produc￾tion of nanosized porous materials. These materials are characterized by a larger 
surface area and, accordingly, the number of active sites where the photocatalytic 
reaction can occur. Moreover, the use of nanosized semiconductors is characterized 
by more efficient transfer of photoinduced charges from the bulk to the material 
surface in a shorter time, thereby reducing the possibility of electron–hole pairs 
recombination [133–135]. Recent studies have shown that reducing the particle sizes 
of α-pyrochlore powders Bi2Ti2O7 [136] and Sn2Ta2O7 [137], as well as perovskites 
LaFeO3 [138] and SrTiO3 [139], leads to an increase in their photocatalytic activity 
in the degradation of methylene blue and hydrogen evolution. The reduction in the 
particle size can be achieved by increasing the grinding time in a ball mill. This 
method has also demonstrated its effectiveness in increasing the rate of degradation 
of organic dyes [139].3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 79
Fig. 3.6 Band structure of the Schottky barrier between metal nanoparticles and semiconductors: 
EF is the Fermi level; SC is a semiconductor; Me is a metal nanoparticle 
Photosensitization using metal nanoparticles. The deposition of metal nanopar￾ticles (NPs), particularly gold, silver, and platinum, is widely used for modifying 
various semiconductors, namely TiO2 [140–142], ZnO [143], g-C3N4 [144], CdS 
[145] and others. In the presence of contact with NPs, the charge distribution in 
composite materials will be determined by the position of the Fermi level of the 
metal relative to the band edges in the semiconductor (Fig. 3.6). 
Fermi levels in contacting metal and semiconductor particles are aligned due to 
thermoelectron emission currents caused by differences in work functions, leading 
to the formation of a charge at the metal–semiconductor contact. If the work function 
of the metal is higher than the Fermi level of the semiconductor, the Schottky barrier 
is formed. In this case, the positive charge (h+) is localized on the semiconductor 
particle, and the negative (e–) is on the metallic one. With this spatial separation 
of electrons and holes, the probability of recombination of the electron–hole pair 
decreases, leading to an increase in the photocatalytic activity [146]. 
Metal NPs also introduce changes in the absorption spectrum of hybrid materials 
due to the effect of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), i.e., collective 
oscillation of free charge carriers [147]. 
Three possible mechanisms of the influence of surface plasmon oscillations of 
metal nanoparticles on the semiconductor are possible [146, 148]: 
– transition of one of the excited electrons from the metal NPs to the semiconductor 
(Fig. 3.7b); 
– there may be greater light scattering due to LSPR on the metal nanoparticle, as a 
result of which the probability of its absorption by the semiconductor increases 
(Fig. 3.7c); 
– plasmon-induced resonant energy transfer occurs, i.e., the energy of plasmon exci￾tation decay is transferred to an electron in the valence band of the semiconductor, 
leading to the excitation of an electron–hole pair.80 A. S. Belousov

The incorporation of noble metal nanoparticles also has a positive effect on the 
photocatalytic properties of perovskites [149, 150] and pyrochlores [151, 152]. The 
main disadvantage of noble metals as co-catalysts is their high cost. Thus, for modi￾fying semiconductors, including perovskites and pyrochlores, it is advisable to use 
cheaper materials with a high density of free charge carriers. The introduction of these 
materials also causes the appearance of the LSPR effect [153]. Recently, it has been 
shown that the incorporation of copper [154], aluminum [155], and bismuth [156], as 
well as non-stoichiometric tungsten oxide (WO3–x) [157] leads to the emergence of 
LSPR and, accordingly, an increase in the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors. 
Creation of heterojunction photocatalysts. Low photocatalytic activity of semi￾conductors in many cases is explained by the rapid recombination of electron–hole 
pairs. One of the most common methods of spatial separation of electrons and holes 
is the creation of SC1/SC2 composites, which significantly increases the quantum 
efficiency of photocatalytic processes. An example of these hybrid systems is a semi￾conductor containing nanoparticles of noble metals, when electron transfer from the 
semiconductor to the metal (Schottky junction) is carried out. 
There are three conventional types of heterojunction photocatalysts (Fig. 3.8), 
namely with a straddling gap (type-I), with a staggered gap (type-II), and with a 
broken gap (type-III). In this case, local electric fields are formed, leading to the 
bending of the Fermi level of both semiconductors, which contributes to the spatial3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 81
separation of photogenerated charges and an increase in the quantum efficiency of 
subsequent chemical processes [158]. Despite the fact that type-II hybrids are the 
most efficient of those presented in Fig. 3.8 heterojunctions, their main disadvantage 
is that the oxidation and reduction abilities of migrated electrons and holes decrease, 
as electrons are localized in the CB of the semiconductor with a lower reduction 
potential, and holes accumulate in the VB of the semiconductor with a lower oxida￾tion potential [159, 160]. Therefore, at this stage of the development of photocatalysis 
science, the most effective composite materials are considered to be those in which 
the so-called “Z-scheme” of charge transfer is implemented [161]. Describing the 
mechanism of action of these heterojunctions (Fig. 3.9), it is assumed that photo￾generated electrons can migrate from the CB of the semiconductor with a lower 
reduction potential to the VB of the material with a lower oxidation potential due to 
the presence of electrostatic attraction between electrons and holes. At the same time, 
electrons and holes are spatially separated on semiconductors with higher reduction 
potential and oxidation potential, respectively, as a result of which a higher ability 
for reduction and oxidation in a photocatalyst is achieved simultaneously [162]. 
It can be assumed that the creation of hybrid photocatalysts based on complex 
oxides with Eg < 3.0 is the most promising way to increase their activity under visible 
light irradiation. This assumption is explained by the following observations:
1. For the creation of heterojunctions, there is a wide range of semiconductors, 
including TiO2 [163, 164], other metal oxides [165], chalcogenides [166], g-C3N4

[167–171], MOFs [172, 173] etc. With the correct selection of components, a 
photocatalyst can be developed that provides a high value of quantum efficiency.
2. This approach allows to combine the advantages of each component, expands the 
range of light absorption, reduces the recombination of photogenerated charge 
carriers and increases resistance to photocorrosion [174]. 
Band gap engineering. Band gap engineering has a great importance for creating 
materials sensitive to visible light, and their subsequent application to solve current 
environmental and energy problems. Three methods of band gap engineering are 
mostly investigated (Fig. 3.10): shifting the lower boundary of the CB, shifting the 
upper boundary of the VB, and introducing impurity levels into the band gap [175]. 
The most common method is doping into anionic positions with nitrogen, carbon, 
sulfur, and phosphorus, which leads to the formation of a new isolated impurity level, 
the energy of which is higher than that of the valence band. As a result, the band 
gap value decreases. Nitrogen (Fig. 3.11) is currently considered the most promising 
dopant [176]. At the same time, materials doped with carbon and phosphorus show 
relatively low efficiency. Doping with these elements turned out to be quite deep, the 
output of photogenerated charge carriers to the surface and surface transfer in this 
case is quite difficult. Doping with sulfur proceeds with less efficiency compared

to nitrogen due to the large ionic radius of the S atom, which makes it difficult to 
include it into the crystal lattice [175, 177]. 
The method of anionic doping is also actively used for modifying complex oxides, 
namely perovskites [178–180] and pyrochlores [181–183]. However, a more rele￾vant way of regulating their activity in visible light is the replacement of cations in 
positions A and M with other elements (cationic doping) [132, 135]. Doping with 
heterovalent cations of a different chemical nature in A and M positions leads to 
the emergence of defects in the structure of the complex oxide, changes the textural, 
optical, redox properties and, therefore, to an increase in their photocatalytic activity. 
The potential stability of synthesized A and B substituted materials is of great impor￾tance. For a quantitative assessment of the perovskites stability the Goldschmidt 
factor or tolerance factor (t) is used: t = (rA + rO)/√2(rM + rO), where rA, rM and 
rO are the ionic radii of A, M and O, respectively [184, 185]. The tolerance factor 
value can vary in the range of t = 0.76–1.13 depending on the degree of oxidation of 
cations in A and M positions, as well as the size of their ionic radii. For perovskites 
with cubic symmetry, the Goldschmidt factor is close to one, and with deviations 
from t = 1 it is possible to lower the symmetry to hexagonal (t > 1) or rhombohedral 
and orthorhombic (t < 1) [132, 186]. 
At the same time, for pyrochlore oxides, there is no single empirical relationship, 
similar to the Goldschmidt factor, for calculating their stability, since they have a 
strong tendency to disorder [187]. The absence of this criterion complicates the 
task of developing substituted pyrochlores, since it becomes difficult to predict their 
stability during cationic doping. On the other hand, several attempts have been made 
to develop an equation for calculating the tolerance factor of pyrochlores. One of 
such models was proposed by Isupov in 1958 based on the assumption that MO6-
octahedra in the pyrochlore structure have a regular shape [188]. The equation for 
calculating the empirical factor in this case is as follows: t = 0.866(r A + rO)/(rB +
rO). As it turned out a few years later, Isupov’s formula is valid only for a small part 
of compounds with the pyrochlore structure. Therefore, later new data on tolerance 
factors began to appear. It was proposed t-factors for compounds with A2M2O7 
structures [189, 190], Ln2−xCaxScMO7−δ (Ln = La, Sm, Ho, Yb; M = Nb, Ta; x =
0, 0.05, 0.1) [191] and Ln2– xDxM2O7–δ (Ln = La–Lu; M = Sn, Ti, Zr, Hf; D = Sr, 
Ca, Mg; x = 0, 0.1) [192]. Despite the uncertainty with the formula for establishing84 A. S. Belousov
the tolerance factor of pyrochlores, in recent years, A- and M-substituted compounds 
with both A2M2O7 and AM2O6 structures have been successfully synthesized, which 
showed higher efficiency in various photocatalytic reactions than their unsubstituted 
analogs. 
As a rule, substitution into the A position for complex oxides proceeds much easier 
than into the M position, which is located in a stable MO6 octahedron. Doping with 
heterovalent cations in the A position, similar to anionic doping, contributes to the 
shift of the edge of the photocatalyst’s absorption from the UV region to the visible 
region due to the formation of new energy levels. Waehayee et al. [193] studied the 
electronic structure and photocatalytic properties of a KNbTeO6 β-pyrochlore (Eg 
= 3.38 eV) doped with tin, silver and copper in the A position (partial replacement 
of K+ cations with Sn2+, Ag+ and Cu2+). The introduction of heterovalent cations 
into the KNbTeO6 structure was carried out by ion exchange and led to a reduction 
in the band gap of the material, and the chemical composition of the synthesized 
pyrochlores was as follows: K0.6Sn0.2NbTeO6 (Eg = 2.51 eV), K0.8Ag0.2NbTeO6 
(Eg = 2.76 eV) and K0.8Cu0.1NbTeO6 (Eg = 3.21 eV). The investigation of the 
role of Ag in reducing the band gap showed that the hybridization of the Ag 4d 
and O 2p states increases the VB maximum, thus reducing the band gap to 2.78 eV 
[194]. Similar changes in the electronic structure are also observed when doping the 
complex oxide with tin cations. However, after the incorporation of copper in the 
structure, a new gap state is formed in the material, which is formed as a result of 
the overlap of empty 3d orbitals of Cu and 2p orbitals of O. In addition to the fact 
that K0.8Cu0.1NbTeO6 is characterized by a larger band gap value compared to other 
substituted pyrochlores and, accordingly, less sensitivity to the visible light, the gap 
state can act as a recombination center for photogenerated charges [195]. The shift 
of energy bands in the semiconductor, leading to a reduction in the band gap, was 
also observed when doping in the A position of perovskites LaTiO3.5–δ [196] and 
SrTiO3 [197] with Ba, Sr, Ca and La, Fe cations, respectively. 
The photocatalytic activity of complex oxides can be enhanced by heterovalent 
doping into the B position, which also reduces band gap by forming new energy 
zones [198, 199]. Moreover, for some perovskites, it has been found that the cation 
in the M position plays a more important role than in the A position, as it serves as the 
catalytic center where redox reactions occur during photocatalysis [135, 200]. The 
application of this method also promotes the appearance of oxygen defects, causing 
relaxation phenomena in AM1– xM’xO3 structures and enhances their photocatalytic 
activity [201]. Thus, the replacement of Fe3+ cations (rB = 0.064 nm) with larger 
Cu2+ (rB = 0.072 nm) not only led to the distortion of a LaFeO3 perovskite crystal 
lattice due to the appearance of oxygen vacancies, but also suppressed the formation 
of large crystallites [202]. Another important aspect of heterovalent doping into 
the B position is the possibility of inhibiting charge recombination by capturing 
photogenerated electrons by transition metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, V) in higher oxidation 
states [203–205]. It was also shown that the presence of Fe2+/Fe3+ and Cu+/Cu2+ 
redox pairs favorably affects the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the system and 
contributes to the effective degradation of organic pollutants [206, 207].3 Theoretical Foundations of Photocatalysis 85
It should be noted that due to their structural flexibility, complex oxides can 
undergo simultaneous replacement in positions A and M. For instance, simultaneous 
doping of LaCoO3 with barium cations into the A position and manganese into 
the M position allowed to obtain a perovskite, characterized by higher structural 
stability to metal leaching compared to the pure compound, as well as activity in 
water purification from organic pollutants [208]. The main reason for the increased 
catalytic activity of the material is the formation of Co–O–Mn bonds in the substituted 
material, which facilitate electron transfer between Co2+/Co3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ redox 
pairs. 
Thus, cationic doping of complex oxides is one of the most common and relevant 
ways to increase the photocatalysts’ sensitivity to the visible light. This method 
allows not only to regulate the band gap of materials, but also facilitates in some 
cases easier electron transfer due to the formation of redox pairs, thereby inhibiting 
the regeneration of photogenerated charge carriers.

4.1 Photocatalytic Degradation of Organics Substances 
in the Presence of Pyrochlores 
Currently, the activity of various photocatalytic systems in the degradation processes 
is studied using a large number of diverse organic substances as model pollu￾tants (synthetic dyes, antibiotics, alcohols, aldehydes, aromatic compounds, etc.). 
However, organic dyes (methylene blue, methyl orange, rhodamine B, etc.) are most 
often used for photocatalytic experiments, which is due not only to the simplicity 
of the experiment, but also to the real problem of environmental pollution by these 
compounds. 
Synthetic dyes, the assortment of which on the world market comprises over 
100,000 items, play a crucial role in the paint and varnish, textile and chemical 
industries. The annual production of synthetic dyes amounts to about 800,000 tons, 
most of which is consumed by the textile industry [1, 2]. At the same time, the 
total losses of dyes at all stages of the textile process are estimated at 10–15%. 
A significant part of synthetic dyes enters wastewater and is discharged into water 
bodies, disrupting their ecological integrity. 
According to experts, synthetic dyes represent a large group of pollutants char￾acterized by high toxicity [3]. The Ecological and Toxicological Association of the 
Dyestuffs Manufacturing Industry (ETAD) reported that among 4,000 studied dyes, 
about 90% are characterized by a medial lethal dose (LD50) value greater than 2·103 
mg kg–1, and the most dangerous are diazo and basic dyes [4]. 
Synthetic dyes are difficult to purify using modern methods of wastewater disin￾fection, such as biological treatment. Thus, in recent years, much attention has been

paid to the development of alternative ways to remove synthetic dyes from wastew￾ater. Some of the most attractive methods of removing synthetic dyes are advanced 
oxidation processes (ozonation, Fenton reaction, ultrasonic, electrochemical and 
photocatalytic oxidation, etc.) [5]. 
Among the listed methods, the photocatalytic process deserves special atten￾tion, since its main advantage is the possibility of using an inexhaustible source 
of energy—sunlight. Other advantages of photocatalysis are environmental friend￾liness, economy (no need for expensive equipment), the possibility of conducting 
the reaction under ambient conditions, and in some cases, rapid decomposition of 
organic compounds to CO2 and H2O (mineralization) without the formation of inter￾mediate toxic compounds [6]. It should be noted that the latter advantage is not 
always realized in the course of laboratory studies when examining the activity of 
various types of photocatalysts. In some cases, photocatalytic degradation of dyes 
leads to the formation of intermediate products, whose toxicity can exceed the orig￾inal compounds and calls into question the feasibility of practical application of the 
studied reaction [7]. 
In the photocatalytic decomposition of dyes in an aqueous solution, two main 
mechanisms can be implemented: indirect and direct oxidation [1, 8]. In the first case, 
the adsorbed substrate (D) is subjected to the reaction by ROS (Eq. 4.9) generated 
via the oxidation of water (Eqs. 4.2 and 4.3) and/or reduction of molecular oxygen 
(Eqs. 4.4–4.8):

The mechanism of direct oxidation includes the formation of the dyes triplet state 
to light absorption (Eqs. 4.10 and 4.11), its further interaction with the photocatalyst 
(Eq. 4.12) and active radicals (Eq. 4.13) [9, 10]:

The degradation of dyes in aqueous solutions can also occur without the participa￾tion of a photocatalyst. In this case, the process is no longer related to photocatalytic 
and does not provide information about the activity of a material. It should also be 
noted that the contribution of indirect oxidation to the substrate conversion is usually 
much more pronounced compared to direct oxidation. 
4.1.1 Effect of Operational Parameters on Photocatalytic 
Degradation of Organics in the Presence of Complex 
Oxides 
In addition to the photocatalyst nature and its basic properties (band gap, specific 
surface area, particle size, presence of co-catalyst or other additives, etc.), the degra￾dation efficiency of an aqueous environment is significantly influenced by the factors 
described below. 
1. pH of the reaction mixture, which determines the charge of the photocatalyst 
surface and, accordingly, the adsorption capacity [11]. It has been shown that 
the effect of varying the pH of the environment is related to the properties of the 
semiconductor surface charge and can be explained based on the concept of the 
point of zero charge (pHPZC), i.e., the pH at which the net charge of total particle 
surface (i.e. absorbent’s surface) is equal to zero (Table 4.1) [2, 12]. For instance, 
for TiO2 pHPZC = 6.8 [13], i.e., at pH values lower than 6.8, the surface of the 
photocatalyst is protonated and has a positive charge and vice versa: 
TiOH(surf.) + H+ → TiOH+

ThO2 8.5–11.0 BiFeO3 5.6 
The variation of pH also significantly affects the mechanism of photodegrada￾tion of organic compounds in aqueous solutions. For TiO2 it was found that at low 
pH values, the degradation reaction occurs with the participation of photogenerated 
holes, while at pH ≥ 7, the active particles are hydroxyl radicals [14]. It is also 
believed that •
OH radicals are most effective in decomposing azo dyes characterized 
by the mandatory presence of one or several azo groups –N = N– [15]. 
2. The amount of the organic compound adsorption. In heterogeneous photo￾catalysis, there is competitive adsorption between water molecules and target 
substance molecules, and the patterns of the effect of compound adsorption on 
the degree of its decomposition are contradictory [16]. Stronger adsorption of the 
substrate on the photocatalyst surface often leads to high photocatalytic activity 
of the material [17]. This pattern is associated with the fact that photogenerated 
active particles are not able to migrate far from their formation centers, which 
results in a low rate of the decomposition of organic substances in the bulk. On 
the other hand, if we are talking about organic dyes, they can act as catalyst 
poisons, which in the case of high adsorption capacity causes a low degree of 
their degradation on some photocatalysts. Another reason for a decrease in the 
photocatalytic activity with strong dye adsorption is the formation of several 
molecular layers on the material surface, which limit the interaction between the 
excited dye molecule and the photocatalyst in the case of direct oxidation and, 
secondly, prevent effective light penetration and its absorption by the material in 
the implementation of the indirect mechanism [18]. 
3. Light intensity. The photocatalytic activity of simple and complex oxides signif￾icantly depends on the intensity of the light (I). The study of the activity of TiO2 
in the UV light in the degradation of organic compounds showed that the degree 
of chloroform degradation is proportional to the light intensity and increases in4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 101
the range from 0 to 35 mW/cm2 [19]. However, at I > 35 mW/cm2 there was 
no increase in the conversion of chloroform, which is explained by a notice￾able increase in the rate of electron–hole pairs formation and, accordingly, their 
recombination. In addition, the catalyst surface in this case is occupied by a large 
number of charges, which limits mass transfer during adsorption and desorption. 
Similar patterns were observed in the photocatalytic decomposition of dyes on 
complex oxides [20]. 
4. Photocatalyst concentration. The amount of catalyst used and its ability to regen￾erate its properties play a crucial role from a practical point of view. The photo￾catalyst concentration, ensuring complete degradation of organic compounds, 
depends on many factors: reactor design, light intensity, nature of the decom￾posed substance, morphology, particle size of the catalyst, etc. As a rule, with 
an increase in the photocatalyst concentration to a certain optimal value, the 
conversion of dyes increases [21–23]. A further increase in material loading 
usually does not lead to an increase in dye conversion, which can be explained 
by the following [24, 25]: 
– any photocatalyst has a maximum adsorption capacity for a given pollutant, 
i.e., adding an excessive amount of it will not have a positive effect on the 
photocatalytic reaction; 
– with a high concentration of the catalyst, light penetration is hindered; 
– excessive concentration of photosensitive material leads to the generation of 
a larger number of active radicals, the rate of their formation is significantly 
higher than the rate of their consumption by the organic compound, as a result 
of which their recombination increases. 
4.1.2 α-Pyrochlore Oxides with A2M2O7 Composition 
for Degradation of Organic Pollutants 
It is necessary to highlight titanates (Bi2Ti2O7 [26], Sm2Ti2O7 [27]), zirconates 
(Bi2Zr2O7 [28], Sm2Zr2O7 [29]) and stannates (Bi2Sn2O7 [30], A2Sn2O7 [31]) as 
promising photocatalysts for the complete conversion of organic substances in water. 
Titanates. The most active research in the field of developing titanates for the decom￾position of organic compounds is dedicated to the creation of bismuth-based mate￾rials. In 2004, it was first reported about the photocatalytic activity of Bi2Ti2O7 in 
the degradation of methyl orange under UV light [32]. The authors also suggested 
that the Bi2Ti2O7 pyrochlore could show activity in the visible light, since its band 
gap is 2.95 eV. This assumption was confirmed by calculations using density func￾tional theory (DFT) for three Bi-containing complex oxides (Bi12TiO20, Bi2Ti2O7 
and Bi4Ti3O12) [33]. 
It was also found that the band gap engineering, namely doping into anionic 
positions with nitrogen and carbon, may be a promising route for expanding the102 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina
visible light absorption range by these materials. Subsequently, the Bi2Ti2O7 α￾pyrochlore began to be widely used for the degradation of organic dyes under visible 
light irradiation: rhodamine B (RhB) [26], methyl orange (MO) [34] and methylene 
blue (MB) [35]. 
It should be noted that contradictory data were obtained about the band gap of 
bismuth titanate (Eg = 2.6–3.3 eV) [26, 34, 35]. Apparently, a significant discrep￾ancy in the results should be explained by the preparation method. As an example, 
comparing the Pechini and co-precipitation methods for preparing Bi2Ti2O7 demon￾strated that the use of the former allows for a higher conversion of organic compounds 
due to the formation of the material with a larger specific surface area [35]. 
The main disadvantages of Bi2Ti2O7 are considered to be its low thermal stability 
and photocatalytic activity in the visible light. One of the most attractive ways to 
increase its thermal stability is the creation of a defective structure. It was established 
that a Bi1.5Ti2O6.25 defect pyrochlore is more stable compared to the stoichiometric 
Bi2Ti2O7 [36]. However, the implementation of this method led to a decrease in the 
photodegradation efficiency due to the presence of oxygen vacancies in Bi1.5Ti2O6.25, 
which can act as traps for photogenerated electrons and holes. Another interesting 
approach to improving the thermal stability of Bi2Ti2O7 is doping into the A-position 
with chromium cations [37]. 
In recent years, a large number of works have been published on improving 
the photocatalytic activity of the Bi2Ti2O7 α-pyrochlore. Doping bismuth titanate 
with nitrogen into anionic positions led to a significant increase in the conversion 
of organic compounds [38], and the subsequent introduction of Fe atoms into the 
structure of the complex oxide allows to a further increase in the photocatalytic 
activity as well as leads to the formation of a new phase, namely a Bi4Ti3O12 layered 
perovskite. The main explanation for the improved photocatalytic characteristics of 
the material, where along with Bi2Ti2O7 is present Bi4Ti3O12, is the possible forma￾tion of a Bi2Ti2O7/Bi4Ti3O12 heterojunction, which provides spatial separation of the 
photogenerated electrons and holes. It is important to note that the efficiency of the 
Bi2Ti2O7/Bi4Ti3O12 hybrid photocatalyst in the degradation of organic dyes was also 
proven in other studies [39]. Another reason for enhancing the photocatalytic activity 
of the Fe-Bi2Ti2O7 material may be a significant reduction in the band gap value after 
doping with Fe atoms (Eg = 2.89 eV and 2.22 eV forBi2Ti2O7 and Fe0.5Bi1.5Ti2O7, 
respectively) [40]. In addition to simple and complex oxides, bismuth oxychloride 
BiOCl, which has recently found wide application in photocatalysis due to its high 
activity, ease of synthesis and non-toxicity [41, 42], is actively used for construction 
heterojunctions with bismuth titanate. It was found that BiOCl/Bi2Ti2O7 heterojunc￾tions exhibit relatively high efficiency in the degradation of dyes under visible light 
irradiation [43, 44]. 
The photocatalytic activity of Bi2Ti2O7 can also be increased by creating hybrid 
systems containing noble metal NPs. The presence of noble metal NPs leads to the 
transfer of excited electrons from the metal nanoparticle to the semiconductor. For 
instance, Zhong and co-authors [45] synthesized a Ag@AgCl/Bi2Ti2O7 photocata￾lyst and showed that its use significantly increases the degree of RhB decomposition 
compared to unmodified AgCl and Bi2Ti2O7. The authors suggested that in this4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 103

composite, a sequential transfer of electrons from the CB of Ag0 to AgCl, and then 
to Bi2Ti2O7 (Fig. 4.1) is possible, leading to spatial separation of photogenerated 
charge carriers. In addition, the formation of the chlorine radicals Cl•
, which have 
strong oxidation ability, is possible in the reaction mixture. Despite the high activity 
and stability of the developed photocatalyst, the main disadvantage of noble metals 
is their high cost. To modify complex oxides, it is more advisable to use cheap mate￾rials with a high density of free charge carriers, such as copper, aluminum, bismuth, 
as well as WO3–x. The use of these dopants causes the LSPR effect and, accordingly, 
increases the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors. 
In addition to Bi2Ti2O7, other titanates with the pyrochlore structure were also 
used for the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds: Gd2Ti2O7 [46, 47], 
Sm2Ti2O7 [27, 48] and Tm2Ti2O7 [49, 50]. The use of some of the synthesized 
pyrochlores allows to achieve high conversions (94% after 80 min) [27]. However, 
it is not economical due to the high cost of rare-earth metals (Gd, Sm, Tm). In 
addition, the extraction and processing of rare-earth metals are often associated with 
significant environmental risks, namely air and water pollution and the formation of 
hazardous wastes [51]. 
Stannates. A2Sn2O7 compounds with the pyrochlore structure have been investigated 
in terms of their potential use as photocatalytic materials due to their environmental 
friendliness and stability. Among such materials, bismuth stannate Bi2Sn2O7 (Eg 
= 2.5–2.8 eV), which has been used in gas sensors as a detector for determining 
carbon monoxide [52], is the most studied photocatalyst. A distinctive feature of 
bismuth stannate is the existence of three crystallographic phases: tetragonal α￾Bi2Sn2O7, stable up to 120 °C; cubic β-Bi2Sn2O7, stable between 120 and 630 °C; 
cubic face-centered γ-Bi2Sn2O7, stable above 630 °C [53–55]. 
Recent studies have shown that unmodified Bi2Sn2O7 exhibits low activity in the 
photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds due to the rapid recombination of 
electron–hole pairs. As a result, a number of methods to increase its efficiency have104 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina
been proposed: optimization of the synthesis method, creation of heterojunctions 
and doping. Thus, the use of 3D-structured Bi2Sn2O7 allows to increase the quantum 
efficiency of the tetracycline degradation compared to 2D material due to an increase 
in the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers from 1.88 to 3.26 ns [30]. 
However, as for other pyrochlore oxides, the most common method of increasing the 
photocatalytic activity of Bi2Sn2O7 is the creation of heterojunctions with various 
semiconductors: ZnO [56], g-C3N4 [57], Ag2CrO4 [58], AgHal [59], Ag@AgHal 
[60], Ag–Ag2CO3 [61]. 
In the photocatalytic decomposition of synthetic dyes, stannates with the 
pyrochlore structure containing lanthanides in position A and characterized by high 
thermal stability have also been used. The effect of the lanthanide nature on the 
activity of Ln2Sn2O7 (Ln = Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Er, Yb) in the degradation of MO under 
UV light (λ = 254 nm) was described [31]. It was found that with a decrease in the 
ion radius from Nd3+ (1.109 Å) to Yb3+ (0.985 Å) a significant red shift (shift of the 
absorption edge to the visible region) and an increase in the specific surface area due 
to the reduction in the crystallites size are observed. This led to a significant increase 
in the MO conversion in the presence of Yb2Sn2O7 (99% after 120 min) compared to 
Nd2Sn2O7 (45% after 150 min). However, the synthesized α-pyrochlores were less 
effective compared to TiO2 (P25, Degussa), in the presence of which a 100% conver￾sion of MO was observed within 30 min. The activity of the Ln2Sn2O7 pyrochlores 
can be increased by creating heterojunction photocatalysts, e.g., with CdZnS solid 
solutions [62]. 
Zirconates. A2Zr2O7 compounds with the pyrochlore structure are promising mate￾rials for creating various functional ceramics, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), refracto￾ries and thermal barrier coatings capable to operate at high temperatures, and also for 
immobilization of high-level nuclear wastes. In recent years, they have also attracted 
attention as highly active photocatalytic systems for the degradation of various pollu￾tants. Particular interest among researchers is aroused by lanthanide zirconates with 
the first half of the La–Gd series having the Fd3m pyrochlore structure, and the 
second half (Tb–Lu) with the Fm3m fluorite structure and the coordination number 
of zirconium from 4 to 6 [63]. It was also noted that when obtaining the Sm2Zr2O7 
compound by the hydrothermal method, the pH of the initial solution, temperature 
and holding time play an important role [29]. At pH = 5.0 Sm2Zr2O7 has the fluo￾rite structure with the particle size of 10 nm, and at pH ≥ 5.5 the pyrochlore-like 
zirconate is formed with the particle size of 15–18 nm. In this case, Sm2Zr2O7 with 
the pyrochlore structure has Eg = 3.85 eV, and its use in the photocatalytic degrada￾tion of Congo red under UV light allows about 75% of the dye to be removed after 
30 min. 
The photocatalytic activity of LaCeZr2O7–SnSe composites was examined in the 
decomposition of Indigo blue under visible light [64]. The Tauc method established 
that the components of the heterojunction have the band gap of 2.84 eV (LaCeZr2O7) 
and 1.55 eV (SnSe). The use of components of the heterojunction for the degradation 
of Indigo blue allowed to achieve a conversion of 89% and 92% in the presence of4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 105
LaCeZr2O7 and SnSe, respectively. At the same time, the synthesized LaCeZr2O7– 
SnSe nanocomposite decomposed about 97% of the dye within 20 min and demon￾strated relatively high stability over 5 consecutive cycles. A Ce2Zr2O7@RGO (RGO 
is reduced graphene oxide) hybrid material also showed high stability in the degra￾dation of ciprofloxacin [65]. This heterojunction not only exhibited activity in the 
degradation reactions, but also catalyzed the reduction of 4-nitrophenol under visible 
light irradiation, which may be important for the development of green processes for 
obtaining amino-substituted organic compounds. A g-C3N4/Ce2Zr2O7 photocatalyst 
[66] demonstrated slightly less stability and reusability for the degradation, as the 
conversion was 99% and 93% after 1 and 4 cycles, respectively.

One of the first attempts to assess the photocatalytic activity of pyrochlore oxides 
in the degradation reaction was made by He and co-workers [67], who found that 
K2Ta2O6 (Eg = 4.0–4.5 eV) is capable to decompose RhB under UV irradiation. 
The activity of this material in the ultraviolet region, including in water decomposi￾tion, was subsequently confirmed by other authors [68–70]. Further research using 
K2Ta2O6 as a photocatalyst for various processes was aimed at shifting its sensitivity 
to the visible region. Using anionic doping, a series of K2Ta2O6–xNx photocatalysts 
was developed and then tested in the degradation of formaldehyde (λ > 400 nm) [71]. 
It was established that nitrogen-doped photocatalysts are characterized by a narrow 
band gap (for compounds with x = 0.256, 0.348 and 0.453 Eg was 2.43, 2.31 and 2.25 
eV, respectively) compared to the pure pyrochlore (Eg = 4.43 eV), which resulted 
in high activity of N-substituted complex oxides in photocatalysis. Similar results 
were obtained in the investigation of photocatalytic activity of N-doped KSbWO6 
[72] and KM0.33W1.67O6 (M = Al, Cr) [73] pyrochlores in the degradation of MB. 
It should be noted that some AB2O6 compounds with the β-pyrochlore structure 
demonstrate a relatively good activity in the photocatalytic degradation of organic 
dyes in visible light without modification. We studied the activity of CsTeMoO6, 
RbTe1.25Mo0.75O6, CsTe1.625W0.375O6 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 β-pyrochlores in the 
photooxidation of MB and MO (a 30 W LED lamp as a visible light source, λ
= 420–600 nm) [74, 75]. It was established that the degree of MB decomposition 
was 15% for CsTeMoO6 and 10% for RbTe1.5W0.5O6, while RbTe1.25Mo0.75O6 and 
CsTe1.625W0.375O6 did not show significant photocatalytic activity. In addition, it 
was found that the CsTeMoO6 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 compounds exhibit an increased 
adsorption capacity towards MB (cationic dye) compared to MO (anionic dye). Inves￾tigation of the adsorption kinetics and the surface chemical composition allowed to 
explain this effect. The surface of these compounds is enriched with alkali metals, 
which have a partially positive charge and in an aqueous environment tend to adsorb 
OH– groups forming the –Cs–O–H group. When adding the cationic dye to the106 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina

medium, which dissociates into an organic cation and chloride anions, the replacing 
of H+ with MC+ occurs, forming the –Cs–O–MB surface group. More complete 
adsorption of MB on the surface of these compounds leads to their more effective 
photooxidation compared to MO, in the case of which abnormally high adsorption 
on the surface of CsTeMoO6 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 was not observed (Fig. 4.2) [76]. 
It should be noted that the photocatalytic activity of CsTeMoO6 and 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 is significantly influenced by the particles size. Decreasing the 
CsTeMoO6 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 particles size from 700 to 300 nm leads to an increase 
in the MB conversion from 15 to 35% and from 10 to 25%, respectively, after 6 h 
of photocatalysis (excluding dye adsorption on the surface) and almost complete 
suppression of electron–hole pairs recombination [77]. 
It was also found that the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 β-pyrochlore can act as a photo-initiator 
of the radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate [78, 79]. In this case, the 
monomer interacts with the complex oxide and forms a coordination complex due 
to the double bonds of the monomer and the vacant orbitals of the metal. In addi￾tion, on the surface of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 O-centered radicals are formed, which graft 
polymer macromolecules onto the surface of the photocatalyst due to the interaction 
of hydroxyl radicals with OH groups. The obtained results have important practical 
significance, since the photopolymerization process for obtaining various polymer 
materials is attracting attention [80, 81].4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 107
Other interesting objects of study from the point of view of their use as photocat￾alysts sensitive to visible light are ANbTeO6 (A = K, Rb, Cs) β-pyrochlores with Eg 
= 3.4 eV. It was recently shown [82] that these complex oxides are capable to absorb 
not only UV irradiation, but also visible light due to their defect structure. However, 
experiments on water splitting showed the advisability of using only UV light to 
initiate the process in the presence of ANbTeO 6, as the authors did not observe H2 
generation when irradiating the solution with visible light. 
The authors [83] developed a type-II CdS/SnNb2O6 heterojunction with the 
cadmium sulfide content of 40 wt.%. The photocatalytic activity of prepared 
composite in the degradation of RhB is approximately 3 and 28 times higher than that 
of unmodified CdS and SnNb2O6, respectively. The heterojunction photocatalyst was 
obtained by growing CdS crystals onto the surface of SnNb2O6 under hydrothermal 
conditions. The use of the CdS/SnNb2O6 hybrid significantly reduced the rate of 
recombination of photogenerated charges (Fig. 4.3). In this case, photogenerated 
electrons are localized in the CB of CdS with a lower reduction potential (–0.43 eV), 
while holes accumulate in the VB of SnNb2O6 with a lower oxidation potential (1.60 
eV). Migrating electrons can react with free oxygen dissolved in water, forming the 
superoxide radicals that cause RhB oxidation. A similar mechanism of electron and 
hole transfer, as well as the oxidation of organic substances by •
O2 
– is observed in 
BiMSbO6(M = Ti, Sn)/BiOBr hybrid materials [84]. 
Despite the high efficiency of type-II heterojunctions in photocatalytic reactions 
compared to unmodified components, in the last decade there has been a trend 
toward the creation of Z-scheme hybrid materials. In this area of research, AB2O6 
compounds with the pyrochlore structure have also found application. 
For instance, a dual ZnMoO4/BiFeWO6/RGO heterojunction demonstrated high 
efficiency in the degradation of Acid Blue 25. In this composite, the reduced graphene 
oxide is located between ZnMoO4 and BiFeWO6, serving as an intermediate point in 
the migration of photogenerated electrons [85]. The authors found that the developed

photocatalyst also has high stability because the dye conversion after 1, 2, 3 and 4 
cycles was 97, 96, 94 and 89%, respectively. 
Zheng and co-authors [86] studied the activity of a Ag1.69Sb2.27O6.25/g-C3N4 
heterojunction photocatalyst, which was formed by the growth of silver antimonate 
crystals onto the surface of graphitic carbon nitride during hydrothermal synthesis. 
The use of the obtained photocatalyst significantly increased the conversion of 
organic compounds, which is approximately 15 and 10 times higher compared to 
unmodified Ag1.69Sb2.27O6.25 when using isopropanol and MB as model pollutants, 
respectively. However, the Ag1.69Sb2.27O6.25/g-C3N4 composite demonstrated low 
stability: if after the first cycle the MB conversion was 98%, then after the third it 
decreased to 68%, despite the fact that according to XRD analysis the structure was 
preserved. 
4.1.4 Mechanism of Photocatalytic Degradation of Organics 
in the Presence of Pyrochlore Oxides 
In the photocatalytic oxidation, active radicals that directly interact with organic 
molecules or water and lead to their decomposition play a crucial role. The electronic 
structure of the catalyst, i.e., the position of the VB and CB relative to the redox 
potentials of water splitting and the formation of various radicals as well as the band 
gap, is a fundamental aspect. 
One of the most accessible methods for determining the band gap is the optical 
method. Since photocatalytic materials are predominantly polycrystalline powders 
with a grain size of several microns, for optical studies it is necessary to use 
methods developed for scattering media. Therefore, to determine the band gap, 
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is used. The most general theory of diffuse 
reflection and transmission of layers scattering and absorbing light was presented 
by Kubelka and Munk (K–M) [87, 88]. This theory is standardly used to determine 
the absorption coefficient of a substance (α) by analyzing its spectral dependence 
using the Tauc method [89]. Conclusions are made about the band gap of bulk and 
nanostructured materials. 
It is known that the effectiveness of photocatalysis is affected not only by the 
fundamental quantity characterizing the material (the band gap), but also by charac￾teristics related to impurities and defects of the crystal structure, which depend on the 
preparation method [87, 89, 90]. Defects can decrease or increase the photocatalytic 
activity of a substance. For instance, it was indicated that an increase in the concentra￾tion of Ti-related defects on the surface of TiO2 improves the photocatalytic activity, 
since it promotes the capture of photoexcited carriers on the surface [91]. Impurities 
are used to expand the spectral range of photosensitivity, which also positively affects 
the efficiency of photocatalysis (e.g., KNbWO6, CsTeMoO6, RbTe1.5W0.5O6) [77]. 
The negative role of defects is associated with the emergence of an additional 
recombination channel, which reduces the concentration of the photogenerated4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 109
Fig. 4.4 Optical schemes: a diffuse reflection, b diffuse transmission at 45° and c transmission 
charge carriers [93]. Information about additional impurity absorption levels within 
the band gap can be obtained from the diffuse transmittance spectroscopy. 
In the DRS method (Fig. 4.4a), the detector receives light reflected and scattered 
from the thin surface layer of the sample, therefore, due to the small length at which 
light interacts with the sample, the spectrum may reveal features associated only with 
strong interband absorption, and weak impurity absorption under these conditions 
will not be able to noticeably reduce the intensity of the light hitting the detector. 
In the transmittance spectroscopy (Fig. 4.4b, c), light, before reaching the detector, 
passes through a layer of material of sufficient thickness, so that absorption in the 
impurity region of the spectrum has high intensity. 
The absorption coefficient is determined from DRS according to the K-M theory 
for a sample of infinite thickness by the following Equation: 
F(R) = α
s = (1 − R)
2 
2R (4.16) 
where F(R) is the K-M function, α is the absorption coefficient, s is the scattering 
coefficient, R is the diffuse reflection. Assuming that the scattering coefficient does 
not depend on the wavelength, the K-M function is proportional to the absorption 
coefficient. The band gap was determined by the Tauc method at the edge of the 
semiconductor absorption: 
(αhν)
n = k
(
hν − Eg
) (4.17) 
where hν is the energy of photons, k is a constant, n = 2 and ½ for direct and indirect 
semiconductors, respectively. 
The significant effect of impurity levels on the determination of the band 
from transmission spectra was shown using the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and CsTeMoO6 β￾pyrochlores (Fig. 4.5) [77]. It can be seen that the absorption by RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
and CsTeMoO6 corresponds to a shorter wavelength region at ~3.4 eV and ~3.1 eV, 
respectively, whereas the values of absorption bands are around ~2.5 and ~2 eV, 
respectively, from the transmission spectra. Thus, it is assumed that the band gap 
of the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and CsTeMoO6 β-pyrochlores contains a defect level with110 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina
Fig. 4.5 a Transmission spectra [74], b reflection spectra and c K–M function [15, 77] for 
CsTeMoO6 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
absorption in the visible light. In addition, in the case of CsTeMoO6 the diffuse 
reflectance spectrum has an additional absorption band at ~2.6 eV, which also relates 
to the visible light. 
The position of the obtained absorption bands cannot be found from absorption 
spectra; they can be located at a depth of 2 and 2.6 eV relative to the bottom of the 
CB or the top of the VB. 
The position of the VB edges and CB relative to the levels of the redox potential 
of water significantly depends both on a material, its crystal structure, and surface 
characteristics, as well as on an environment. In the process of equilibrating the 
electrochemical potential between the photocatalyst and the adjacent environment 
(e.g., an electrolyte) electrons are transferred through the interface “photocatalyst/ 
environment”. The direction of electron transfer is determined by the relative elec￾trochemical potentials of the photocatalyst and the medium (i.e., the Fermi level in 
the solid and the medium). Electrons will be transferred across the “semiconductor/ 
electrolyte” phase boundary until the chemical potentials (Fermi levels) in the solid 
and the solution are equalized [94]. Despite the fact that deionized water is a dielectric 
with a bandgap of ~9 eV [95], it also acts as a weak electrolyte. 
As a result of the electron transfer on the photocatalyst surface, a depleted layer is 
formed, over which the bending of electron levels occurs, determining the alignment 
of band edges to the redox potential levels of water [96].4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 111
Therefore, to properly understand the photocatalytic water splitting in an environ￾ment, it is necessary to consider that the positions of the electron levels of compounds 
determined experimentally by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) method in 
vacuum and the Mott-Schottky method in aqueous solution (flat band potential) will 
differ. For instance, changes in the case of CoO oxides (Ev(vac) = –5.1 eV, Ev(water) 
= –8 eV, relative to the vacuum level), WO3 (Ev(vac) = –9.7 eV, Ev(water) = –7.2 
eV, relative to the vacuum level), V2O5 (Ev(vac) = –9.4 eV, Ev(water) = –8.1 eV, 
relative to the vacuum level) are significant [97, 98]. 
A possible alternative to these rather laborious experimental methods are computa￾tional techniques for assessing electronic structure. Quantum chemical calculations, 
which can be quite lengthy and complex for inorganic crystals, are traditionally 
used to study the electronic structure of materials in vacuum. Also, since the main 
working environment of photocatalysts is water and various aqueous solutions, a 
simplified semi-empirical methodology can be used to calculate the band structure 
of an undoped semiconductor. It was shown that there is a linear correlation between 
the Pearson electronegativity of atoms (the electrochemical potential of atoms, χ), 
constituting oxide compounds, and the electron affinity of the compound (EA) [99– 
101]. If we assume that the position of the Fermi level of the compound will be 
located halfway between the VB and CB, then the electron affinity value will be [94, 
101]: 
EA = χ−1/2Eg or EC = −EA = −χ + 1/2Eg (4.18) 
The electronegativity of the compound in this case is calculated by Equation: 
χ =
(
∏
P
k=1 
χk
)1 
p 
(4.19) 
where p is the number of atoms and k = 1, 2, 3…k, χk is the electronegativity of an 
atom [99]. 
Since the flat band potential of the semiconductor Ufb (reflecting the properties of 
the phase boundary surface) and its electron affinity EA are measures of the position 
of the intrinsic conduction band relative to different standards (standard electrode 
potential and vacuum level, respectively), they are linked by Equation [101]: 
EA = E0 + Ufb + Δfc + ΔpH (4.20) 
where E0 is the constant linking the reference electrode and the vacuum level (E0 
= –4.5 V for standard hydrogen electrode), Δfc is a correction coefficient between 
the Fermi level of the doped semiconductor and the bottom of the CB (~0.1 eV for 
metal oxides doped more than 10%), ΔpH is the potential drop across the Helmholtz 
layer due to specific adsorption of OH– and H+ ions. 
For each semiconductor, there is a certain unique point at which the number of 
positively and negatively charged ions at the phase boundary is equal. At this point,112 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina
the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer due to adsorbed ions is equal to zero,
ΔpH is also ~0. This point is called the point of zero zeta potential (pzzp), and the 
flat band potential is determined experimentally. 
It was shown that measured flat band potentials Ufb within the error of ~0.2 V 
correspond to the values of electron affinity EA calculated by Eq. (4.20) [99]. At 
the same time, even without a clear account of the values and (Δfc + ΔpH) ~ 0, the 
predicted flat band potentials Ufb are close enough to experimental ones to serve as 
a guide for evaluating the properties of a compound. 
Thus, the flat band potential can be theoretically estimated as [101]: 
Ufb = EA = χ−1/2Eg−E0 (4.21) 
The position od VB and CB of semiconductors in solution will be equal, 
respectively [94, 102]: 
ECB = χ−1/2Eg−E0 (4.22) 
EVB = ECB−Eg (4.23) 
Thus, using Eqs. (4.22) and (4.23) and calculated values of electronegativity 
(RbTe1.5W0.5O6) = 6.1 and χ(CsTeMoO6) = 5.89 [], the band structure of 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and CsTeMoO6 was schematically represented (Fig. 4.6), where two 
variants of the arrangement of defect absorption levels are indicated.
The Tauc method for determining the band gap value is graphical and gives some 
error. For most semiconductors, the error is insignificant, which is explained by the 
sharp slope of the K-M function in the absorption area, which allows the band gap 
value to be calculated unambiguously. The clearer and steeper the change in height 
on the function graph (F(R)
2), the smaller the error. 
In the case of oxides, many researchers face a gentle slope on the Tauc graph, 
which should lead to an increase in the error. The error estimate of the graphical 
determination of the band gap value for RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and CsTeMoO6 is 3.4 ± 0.3 
eV and 3.1 ± 0.3 eV, respectively. Using the maximum and minimum band gap for 
each material, the error range for the values of EVB and ECB can also be obtained. 
Figure 4.6 shows the positions of EVB and ECB as shaded rectangles with a width 
that takes into account the determination errors. 
The energies of the electron and hole, which are generated on the semiconductor 
surface under the light with energy greater than Eg, theoretically suffice to initiate 
oxidation or reduction processes in those reactions that are located within the band 
gap. The processes that are closer to the top of VB and the bottom of the CB are 
most likely to occur. 
Thus, if we take into account the error of the estimated calculation of the band 
structure, its accuracy may not be enough for a definitive answer as to which radicals 
in the system will be formed and participate in the degradation of organic substances.4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 113

To study the mechanism of photooxidation in more detail and to establish the 
active radicals formed on the surface during photocatalytic oxidation, additional 
experiments with radical scavengers are required. Special components capable of 
selectively interacting with various active particles are introduced into the photocat￾alytic system, in addition to the catalyst and the model organic substance. Acrylamide 
(AA) reacts with superoxide radicals (•
O2 
–), EDTA with holes (h+), and isopropyl 
alcohol (IPA) with hydroxyl radicals (•
OH) [103]. When the scavenger removes 
active radicals directly involved in the reaction, the photocatalytic degradation is not114 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina
Fig. 4.7 Photoluminescence spectra of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid, which was formed by the inter￾action of terephthalic acid and hydroxyl radicals for Rb0.9Nb1.625Mo0.375O5.62 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
observed. If the scavenger reacts with radicals that are not formed in the system or 
do not affect the process, no changes in the conversion will be detected. 
An additional experiment to detect hydroxyl radicals using terephthalic acid (TA) 
is often used. When TA and •
OH interact, 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid is formed, 
which is capable of fluorescing at a wavelength of ~425 nm when excited at a 
wavelength of 280 nm [104]. In this case, terephthalic acid acts as a model organic 
compound in the photocatalytic experiment. 
With such experiments, it was established which active radicals are formed during 
the photocatalytic process on the surface of a number of β-pyrochlores. The formation 
of the hydroxyl radicals in the photocatalytic system was directly established for 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and Rb0.9Nb1.625Mo0.375O5.62 (Fig. 4.7) [75, 105]. 
However, after the addition of IPA during photocatalytic degradation 
of MB using RbTe1.5W0.5O6, the conversion decreased slightly, while for 
Rb0.9Nb1.625Mo0.375O5.62 it decreased noticeably compared to the control experi￾ment (Table 4.2). This means that although both catalysts lead to the formation of 
hydroxyl radicals in the reaction system, which react with organic pollutants, in the 
case of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 they are not the main active radicals.
Also, it can be noted that when adding isopropyl alcohol during photocatalytic 
degradation of MO using Rb0.9Nb1.625Mo0.375O5.62, the dye conversion was almost 
not observed. This indicates that •
OH are the main active radicals involved in the 
reaction. 
On the other hand, in the case of CsTeMoO6 as a photocatalyst, an abnormal 
increase in the conversion of methyl orange was observed after the addition of the
•
OH radical scavenger (Table 4.2) []. However, an experiment with terephthalic 
acid showed the absence of photoluminescence of the solution after irradiation and, 
therefore, the absence of •
OH radicals. 
Thus, the results of the CsTeMoO6 experiment with IPA may be explained by 
the fact that in some cases the added scavenger can act as a co-catalyst. Probably, 
IPA complicates the reaction system and accelerates the degradation of MO, as the4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 115

CH3CH(OH)CH3 + e− + O2 + H+ → CH3COCH3 +• OH + H2O (4.24) 
The generated hydroxyl radicals act as additional oxidation agents and lead to an 
increase in the conversion of MO. To test the hypothesis, a photooxidation experiment 
of IPA using the CsTeMoO6 catalyst was conducted. The results showed that a 
small amount of acetone is present in the reaction solution after irradiation for 2 
h, while the initial IPA does not contain acetone impurities []. Thus, when using 
scavengers to clarify the mechanism of the photocatalytic decomposition reaction, 
control experiments on the interaction of the model organic substance and scavengers 
as well as the interaction of the catalyst and scavengers also play an important role. 
When adding the hole scavenger, the photocatalytic process for the β-pyrochlores 
listed in Table 4.2 also changes in different ways. An interesting observation is an 
increase in the conversion of MB for RbTe1.5W0.5O6 after the addition of EDTA. 
Since holes participate in the formation of hydroxyl radicals, the same behavior of 
the reaction system was expected as in the experiment with the addition of IPA, 
however, after the addition of EDTA, the conversion of MB increased almost 2 
times. Thus, removing holes from the reaction system is favorable for photooxidation 
compared to the control experiment. This can be explained by the apparent tendency 
for the recombination of the electron–hole pairs on the surface of RbTe1.5W0.5O6. 
The recombination of photogenerated charge carrier is one of the common prob￾lems of photocatalytic materials, leading to low conversion. On the one hand, the 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 particles are quite large (~700 nm), which increases the probability116 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina
of electron–hole recombination at defects in the crystal structure during their migra￾tion from the bulk to the surface. On the other hand, the catalyst surface may have 
specific states that can act as traps for charge carriers, or this may be a conse￾quence of the presence of an additional absorption band in the visible light. The 
addition of the hole scavenger leads to a decrease in the recombination on the cata￾lyst surface and, accordingly, better charge separation. As a result, the generated 
electrons effectively interact with dissolved oxygen to form the superoxide radicals. 
In the case of adding EDTA to the reaction mixture using CsTeMoO6, no signif￾icant changes in the photodegradation process occurred. This means that holes do 
not participate in photooxidation of the dye. However, a slight effect associated 
with a decrease in concentration on the photocatalytic decomposition of both MB 
and MO was observed for the system with the Rb0.9Nb1.625Mo0.375O5.62 photocata￾lyst. When AA is added to the system, the photocatalytic oxidation of MB and MO 
almost stopped both for RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and CsTeMoO6, and noticeably decreased 
for Rb0.9Nb1.625Mo0.375O5.62. Thus, in all systems, the •
O2 
– radicals were definitely 
formed, and for RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and CsTeMoO6 they are the main reactive species that 
lead to the degradation of organic dyes. Based on experiments with scavengers, the 
reactions on the surface of RbTe1.5W0.5O6, CsTeMoO6, and Rb0.9Nb1.625Mo0.375O5.62 
can be written as follows (Table 4.3). In the case of CsTeMoO6, the reactions with 
scavengers did not determine which reactions involve holes that automatically form 
when electron–hole pairs are formed under the visible light. However, in the literature 
for rutile TiO2 [107], a specific surface reaction of hole interaction was previously 
described, which leads to them not having time to react with adsorbed molecules 
of the scavenger from the solution. The authors [107] suggested that the bridging 
Ti–O–Ti bonds are located on the oxide surface close enough to cause interaction 
between oxygen atoms due to the specific crystal structure. These bonds sequen￾tially react with holes in water and form peroxide groups Ti–O–O–Ti. These groups 
further interact with holes and water molecules, resulting in the generation of •
O2 
– 
and the restoration of the original Ti–O–Ti surface structure. Thus, on the surface of 
CsTeMoO6, most likely, a similar path of hole interaction without the formation of 
the hydroxyl radicals is observed. According to the scheme in Fig. 4.8, the H+ ions 
are formed during surface hole reactions, and a weakly acidic environment should 
form near the surface of the catalyst, leading to the conversion of the •
O2 
– radicals 
into the protonated form •
O2H.
Thus, the CsTeMoO6 photocatalyst is capable to generate the •
O2 
– radicals as a 
result of electron and hole reactions. Electrons can generate these radicals only in the 
presence of dissolved oxygen, and constant interaction between the reaction solution 
and the air is necessary. The •
O2 
– radicals are formed near the catalyst surface, as 
well as in the solution, and can oxidize dye molecules that are adsorbed or located 
in the solution. 
The study of solution composition after the photocatalytic degradation of organic 
substances using UV–Vis spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC–MS), and mass spectrometry allowed to analyze the reaction products. This 
issue is related to the fact that the goal of the photocatalytic degradation is not just 
to reduce the concentration of the initial organic pollutant, but to decompose it into4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 117

H2O and CO2, which do not require special disposal. A small depth of conversion of 
complex organic molecules can lead to the formation of a larger number of various 
harmful organic substances. 
Thus, the investigation of the MB and MO decomposition products on 
the RbTe1.5W0.5O6, CsTeMoO6 and Rb0.9Nb1.625Mo0.375O5.62 catalysts with β￾pyrochlore structure showed approximately the same dye conversion with the forma￾tion of similar low molecular weight compounds. For instance, the description below 
is given for the Rb0.9Nb1.625Mo0.375O5.62 material. 
Methyl orange and methylene blue have a chromophore group by color (azo- and 
thiazine-, respectively). Absorption spectra of the initial solution and the solution 
after 8 h of photocatalysis showed a decrease in peak intensity at 465.6 nm for the 
MO azo group and at 664 nm for the MB thiazine group (Fig. 4.9). This indicates 
the decomposition of chromophore groups and decolorization of the solution. The 
appearance of a peak for the MO spectrum at ~235 nm indicates the formation of 
aromatic products. The MB spectrum already has this peak, which can be explained 
by the partially oxidized initial MB solution and is confirmed by HPLC–MS analysis.
Mass spectra of solutions (Fig. 4.10) showed a decrease in the concentration of MB 
(m/z = 284). However, a peak with m/z = 285 is observed after degradation, which 
is associated with the colorless leuco form of methylene blue (LMB), which usually118 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina

forms in an acidic environment [108]. An increased acidic environment during photo￾catalysis is most likely associated with the formation of a large number of hydroxyl 
radicals by the reaction H2O + h+ → H+ + •
OH.
A peak with m/z = 270 corresponds to the azure B dye, which is formed as a 
result of partial demethylation of MB [109, 110]. Although it is present in the initial 
solution, its concentration after photodecomposition increased. The N–CH3 bonds 
in methylene blue have the lowest energy (70.8 kcal mol–1), and they are degraded 
by the •
OH radicals first [111]. Therefore, the degradation of MB always begins with 
demethylation to form azure B or azure A (m/z = 256). 
The hydroxyl radicals also attack the –C–S+ = C functional group of methylene 
blue. The bond energy of this group is ~76 kcal mol–1 [111]. This interaction leads 
to the opening of the aromatic ring of the dye. 
The main low molecular weight product in the MB degradation on pyrochlores 
is m/z = 126. This molecular mass can describe both aromatic compounds, e.g., 
hydroxythiophenol, and non-aromatic compounds. However, according to UV–Vis 
spectroscopy results, the probability of hydroxythiophenol formation is higher. It 
should be emphasized that aminothiophenol was not formed due to the high concen￾tration of hydroxyl radicals, which led to the oxidation of the amino group to the 
hydroxyl. In addition, there are no peaks between m/z = 256 and 126, which may 
be associated with the rapid decomposition of intermediate compounds, while the 
oxidation of azure A and B and hydroxythiophenol are the rate-determining steps of 
the process. 
In the mass spectra of the initial MO, there an oxidized (m/z = 306) and non￾dissociated (m/z = 328) forms of the dye, which may be associated with electrospray 
ionization (Fig. 4.11) [112]. After photodegradation of the dye, only its oxidized form 
remains, and the main decomposition products are compounds with m/z = 285, 283 
(demethylation products of MO) m/z = 126 (hydroxythiophenol). Thus, the hydroxyl 
radicals primarily attack the N–CH3 and N = N bonds.4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 119

An analysis of oxidation products for the MB and MO using RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
and CsTeMoO6 showed similar patterns of the decomposition reaction, which is 
likely related to both similar active radicals and the mechanism of the dye molecule 
adsorption on the catalysts surface [15, 77].120 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina

The detected degradation products of dyes confirm the ability of photocatalysts 
with the pyrochlore structure to break N=N, C–C, C–N and S–C bonds. In addition, 
there is a slight methylation of the initial MB molecules, which can be explained by 
the catalytic properties of transition metals in the composition of compounds. 
4.1.5 A Short Overview 
Compounds with the pyrochlore structure have found wide application for the degra￾dation of organic compounds in water (Table 4.4). Among the compounds with the 
A2M2O7 structure, titanates, stannates and zirconates have been extensively used. 
The application of some A2M2O6 and AM2O6 pyrochlores allows to increase the 
degradarion rate, but it still remains low. The most attractive way to improve the 
photocatalytic activity of the A2M2O6 and AM2O6 compounds with pyrochlore 
structure is the creation of heterojunctions, especially those in which the Z-scheme 
of photogenerated charge transfer is realized. Moreover, it was recently shown that4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 121
the development of heterojunction photocatalysts is relevant for compounds with the 
A2M2O7 structure [113].
Another interesting approach to enhance the photocatalytic activity is band gap 
engineering, namely doping with heterovalent cations of a different chemical nature 
(e.g., Mn, Sr, Fe, Ag, Cu and Sn) into the A- and M-positions. At present, this method 
is most often implemented for compounds with the A2M2O7 structure. Substituted 
Bi1.65Fe1.16Nb1.12O7 [114], Bi1.33Fe0.052Nb1.24Fe1.04O7 [115], (Sr0.6Bi0.305)2Bi2O7 
[116, 117] and Bi1.5Nb1.5CuO7 [118] pyrochlores have been recently synthesized. 
Some of these compounds were tested as photocatalysts for the degradation of 
organic compounds. It was found that the (Sr0.6Bi0.305)2Bi2O7 material is more active 
compared to the unmodified Bi2Sn2O7 [116]. Considering this, heterovalent doping 
with cations may be a promising route to improve activity for compounds with the 
AM2O6 and A2M2O6 structure. 
It should be noted that comparing the activity of photocatalysts obtained in 
different studies (Table 4.4) is often a complex task, considering that the decom￾position of organic compounds is carried out under various conditions (visible light 
source, photocatalyst amount, nature and concentration of the pollutant, etc.). 
4.2 Photocatalytic Water Splitting on Pyrochlore Oxides 
Currently, investigations in this field are mainly focused on two directions: 
– creation of solar cells that allow to convert solar energy into electrical energy; 
– development of direct conversion of solar energy into the chemical energy using 
thermochemical or quantum systems. 
The advantage of the second method of solar energy conversion is the absence of 
the need to build an electrical circuit [121, 122]. In the case of quantum converters of 
solar energy into chemical energy, the most interesting is the production of hydrogen 
by the photocatalytic processes, imitating the function of photosynthesis of green 
plants or cyanobacteria [123]. 
Active research on the photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production 
has been actively conducted since the 1980s (Fig. 4.12a), when a pioneering work 
was published [124]. At the same time, about 4–5 times more works are published 
annually on the topic related to the decomposition of various organic pollutants 
(Fig. 4.12b), which may be associated with the simplicity of the photocatalytic 
experiment. Nevertheless, both graphs presented in Fig. 4.12 have an exponential 
view, which indicates the growing interest in the photocatalytic water splitting and 
decomposition of organic compounds.
The main reasons necessitating the development of photocatalytic systems for 
hydrogen evolution are:
1. The use of solar light as a renewable energy source to produce hydrogen is 
a promising approach to solving issues related to the global energy crisis.122 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina Table 4.4 Recent results on the use of photocatalytic systems based on pyrochlores for the degradation of organic compounds Photocatalyst (loading) Preparation method

According to experts’ forecasts, world energy consumption will double by 2050 
and triple by the end of the century compared to current consumption, which 
is associated with the exponential growth of the world economy and population 
[125]. Hydrogen is a carbon-free energy source and is characterized by excep￾tional energy density (33 kW h kg–1) and a calorific value (120 MJ kg–1), which 
makes it an attractive raw material for replacing traditional fossil sources [126].
2. Hydrogen is a valuable raw material for heavy organic and petrochemical 
industry. According to Rystad forecasts, a noticeable increase in hydrogen 
consumption is expected in the 2030s, by 2050 consumption will increase 5 times: 
from the current level of 70 million tons per year to almost 350 million tons per 
year. In addition, hydrogen can serve as a raw material for CO2 reduction into 
value-added chemicals, such as methanol, which is considered an eco-friendly 
fuel and is compatible with internal combustion engines [127]. 
4.2.1 Fundamentals of Water Splitting 
The reaction of full water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen (4.25) is described by 
two redox reactions: oxygen formation due to four-electron oxidation of water (4.26) 
and hydrogen formation due to two-electron reduction of protons (4.27): 
2H2O + hν → 2H2 + O2; (4.25) 
2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−; (4.26) 
2H+ + 2e− → H2. (4.27)126 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina
Fig. 4.13 Schematic representation of water splitting on semiconductor photocatalysts [130] 
From a thermodynamic point of view, the reaction of full water splitting under 
normal conditions is thermodynamically unfavorable, since the change in the Gibbs 
energy (ΔG°) in the reaction (4.25) per one molecule of hydrogen is very large and 
amounts to 237.2 kJ mol–1 (1.23 eV) [128]. Thus, for effective photocatalytic water 
splitting under visible light, the band gap of a semiconductor should be within 1.23 
eV (λ = 1000 nm) < Eg < 3.0 eV (λ = 420 nm) [129]. At the same time, as shown in 
Fig. 4.13, the electrode potential of the CB edge should exceed the potential of H2O 
oxidation (E(O2/H2O) = +1.23 V relative to SHE at pH = 0) for oxygen formation 
(4.26), and the electrode potential of the VB edge should be more negative than the 
H+ reduction potential (E(H+/H2) = 0 V relative to SHE at pH = 0) (4.27) [130]. 
To photocatalytic water splitting, organic and inorganic electron donors are used. 
Electron donors (or sacrificial agents) in this case perform the function of hole 
absorbers, significantly reducing the recombination of electron–hole pairs. The use of 
organic compounds has a practical character, since water is most often contaminated 
with organic substances, i.e., realization of this approach can provide simultaneous 
water purification and hydrogen evolution. Methanol [131], ethanol [132], glycerol 
[133, 134], and triethanolamine (TEA) [135] are used as organic compounds. Inor￾ganic electron donors have also found application, among which the most commonly 
used are hydrogen sulfide or water-soluble sulfides [136, 137]. A detailed description 
of the processes, occurring in aqueous solutions of electron donors during photo￾catalytic water splitting, is outlined in a review by researchers from the Boreskov 
Institute of Catalysis SB RAS [128]. 
The literature analysis showed that a wide range of semiconductor materials based 
on simple oxides [138], chalcogenides [139], perovskites [140], graphitic carbon4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 127
nitride [141], MOFs [142] are proposed for photocatalytic water splitting. In recent 
years, photocatalysts based on compounds with pyrochlore structure are attracting 
more and more attention as effective systems for hydrogen evolution. The first report 
on the use of pyrochlores in water splitting dates back to 2004, studied the production 
of hydrogen from an aqueous methanol solution on SnNb2O6, Sn2Nb2O7, SnTa2O6 
and Sn2Ta2O7 compounds was investigated [143]. The photocatalytic activity of 
NiOx/AMWO6 (A = Rb, Cs; M = Nb, Ta) composites under UV light irradia￾tion was studied simultaneously [144]. The highest rate of hydrogen (W(H2) =
69.7 μmol h–1) and oxygen (34.5 μmol h–1) production was achieved on the NiOx/ 
RbTaWO6 photocatalyst. Since then, there have been a sufficient number of reports 
on the use of photocatalytic systems based on pyrochlores for water splitting. The 
most widespread are studies related to increasing the activity of complex oxides in 
visible light: band gap engineering and creation of heterojunctions. 
4.2.2 α-Pyrochlore Oxides with A2M2O7 Composition 
for Water Splitting 
In the scientific literature, there are several reports on the use of unmodified 
A2M2O7 compounds in water splitting [90, 145–147]. However, their activity remains 
extremely low. As an example, a slight rate of hydrogen formation (W(H2) =
3.7 μmol h–1 gcat –1) can be achieved on tin tantalate Sn2Ta2O7 with an average 
particle size of about 40 nm [145]. The photocatalytic performances of Sn2Ta2O7 
can be improved by Pt photodeposition. In this case, the rate of hydrogen production 
increases approximately 2.5 times. Similar patterns were obtained in the presence 
of tin niobate, but the rate of hydrogen formation on Pt/Sn2Nb2O7 was higher and 
amounted to 82 μmol h–1 gcat –1. 
The use of an Y2Ti2O7 α-pyrochlore synthesized by the solid-state method did not 
lead to the formation of hydrogen and oxygen under visible light irradiation [147]. 
Meanwhile, a low rate of O2 formation (7.3 μmol h–1) in the absence of H2 release 
was observed when the photocatalyst was modified with rhodium into position B to 
obtain a Y2Ti1.94Rh0.06O7 compound. 
Manganese can also serve as a dopant that significantly improves the photocat￾alytic activity in hydrogen evolution. It was shown that the incorporation of 1 wt.% 
of Mn in the structure of Bi2Ti2O7 allows to double the rate of hydrogen formation 
compared to unmodified pyrochlore from a methanol aqueous solution [148]. 
Other examples of pyrochlore modification with metals not related to the platinum 
group include the replacement of two B4+ cations with M3+ and M5+ cations to form 
compounds A2 
3+M3+M’5+O7 [149, 150]. For instance, for Sm2MTaO7 pyrochlores 
(M = Y, In, Fe, Ga) it was found that the nature of the B3+ cation significantly 
affects the electronic structure and band gap, which was 4.3, 3.7, 2.0, and 4.1 eV 
for Sm2YTaO7, Sm2InTaO7, Sm2FeTaO7, and Sm2GaTaO7, respectively (Fig. 4.14) 
[150]. The authors concluded that the VB for each pyrochlore in the series is formed128 A. S. Belousov and D. G. Fukina
due to the hybridization of 4f orbitals of Sm and 2p orbitals of O, and the CB consists 
of 5d orbitals of Ta and orbitals of the M3+ cation (4d Y, 5s5p In, 3d Fe, and 4s4p 
Ga). Moreover, as can be seen from Fig. 4.14, it is precisely the pyrochlores with 
the wide band gap (M3+ = Y, In, Ga) that should be active in hydrogen evolution, 
since the electrode potential of the bottom of the CB is more negative than the proton 
reduction potential. This was confirmed by photocatalytic experiments, where the 
activity of the compounds in water splitting depending on the nature of the M3+ 
cation was arranged in the following order: Sm2YTaO7 > Sm2GaTaO7 > Sm2InTaO7 
> Sm2FeTaO7. 
Fig. 4.14 Electronic structure of Sm2MTaO7 (M = Y, In, Fe, Ga) compounds with α-pyrochlore 
structure [150]4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 129
It was recently demonstrated that the protonated form of tin niobate (H4Nb2O7) 
is characterized by greater activity in water splitting compared to Sn2Nb2O7 under 
UV irradiation, which is explained by the hierarchical porous structure of H4Nb2O7 
[151]. The rate of hydrogen formation on H4Nb2O7 and Sn2Nb2O7 was 240 and 20 
μmol h–1 gcat –1, respectively. 
The analysis of the latest achievements in the development of photocatalytic 
systems based on pyrochlores shows that hybrid materials containing A2M2O7 
compounds have also found application in water splitting. As an example, the use 
of a (Sr0.6Bi0.305)2Bi2O7/TiO2 type-I heterojunction with the band gap of 2.95 eV 
allowed to increase the hydrogen yield approximately 7 times compared to unmodi￾fied titanium dioxide [117]. The rate of hydrogen formation can be further improved 
by creating dual heterojunctions, e.g., Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 [152]. The rate of 
hydrogen formation from a methanol aqueous solution on Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/ 
TiO2, Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 and TiO2 was about 587, 217 and 83 μmol h–1 g cat –1, 
respectively. 
Promising materials for the development of composites are also MXenes, which 
are two-dimensional carbides and nitrides of transition metals [153, 154]. One of 
the most demanded MXenes in photocatalysis is Ti3C2. Based on this material, 
heterojunctions with TiO2 [155], g-C3N4 [156], Bi2WO6 [157] and MOFs [158] 
show improved activity in various photocatalytic applications. Wang et al. [159] 
studied the activity of a La2Ti2O7/Ti3C2 composite in photocatalytic water splitting 
and demonstrated that the use of this hybrid allows to increase the H2 evolution rate 
16 times compared to the La2Ti2O7 α-pyrochlore. The authors suggested that during 
the synthesis of the heterojunction, quantum dots of Ti3C2 may form, which is the 
main reason for the improved activity. 
4.2.3 Defect α- and β-Pyrochlore Oxides for Water Splitting 
Many AM2O6 and A2M2O6 compounds currently used for hydrogen evolution 
are characterized by a wide band gap. For instance, for CsTaWO6, K2Ta2O6 and 
ANbTeO6 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) complex oxides the band gap is 3.6 [160–162], 4.5 
[163] and 3.4 eV [82], respectively, thus these materials only exhibit activity under 
UV irradiation. The optimization of the preparation method, namely the replace￾ment of traditional solid-state reaction with hydrothermal approach [163], led to 
an increase in photocatalytic activity in UV light, but did not solve the problem of 
their sensitivity to visible light. Meanwhile, doping CsTaWO6 into anionic positions 
with nitrogen and sulfur allowed to shift the absorption of the defect pyrochlore 
into the visible region [164, 165]. A relatively high rate of hydrogen formation (210 
μmol h–1 gcat –1) in visible light was achieved on a CsTaWO6–x–ySxNy pyrochlore 
(Eg = 2.06 eV) [164]. It has been established that some defect pyrochlores demon￾strate activity comparable to classical semiconductors in water splitting under visible 
light irradiation. Ravi and co-workers [166] found that photocatalytic water splitting

tin to obtain a Sn0.5Fe0.33W1.67O6 compound allowed to further improve the mate￾rial performances (W(H2) = 1624 μmol h–1 gcat –1). It was also noted that in the 
case of doped with Sn2+cations pyrochlores, the nature of the tin precursor (SnSO4, 
Sn(OAc)2, SnC2O4, SnCl2·2H2O, SnBr2, SnI2) and solvent (water, methanol, acetic 
acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, acetone, chloroform, toluene) play an important 
role [167]. Photocatalysts obtained by ion exchange reaction between KTaWO6 (Eg 
=3.6 eV) and precursors with a high tin content (SnSO4 and Sn(OAc)2) in an aqueous 
medium are characterized by a narrow band gap (Eg < 3.0 eV) and greater activity. It 
is also known that a number of CsMxW2–xO6 β-pyrochlores, where the M position is 
partially occupied by cations in the oxidation state 3+ and 2+ with partially filled d 
sub-levels (Mn2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+), are characterized by a smaller band 
gap value (up to ~2 eV), shifted into the visible light region, compared to classical 
pyrochlores. However, experiments on photocatalytic water splitting showed that 
these phases, on the contrary, do not have the ability to generate hydrogen, appar￾ently due to the active electron–hole pair recombination. Whereas their analogs with 
M = Al3+, Mg2+, Ti4+, Ta5+, Li+ with Eg > 3.0 eV conversely demonstrated the ability 
to decompose water (with the generation rate up to 450 μmol h–1) [168, 169]. 
4.2.4 A Short Overview 
Compounds with pyrochlore structure, especially A2B2O7, have been attracting 
researchers’ attention for water splitting in recent years. However, the rate of H2 
formation on these materials is very low in most cases, and to improve the photo￾catalytic activity, cationic doping and creation of heterojunctions are most studied 
strategies (Table 4.5).
4.3 Perspectives of Pyrochlore Oxides for Photocatalytic 
CO2 Reduction 
The relevance of this research topic in the field of photocatalysis is explained by the 
fact that CO2 significantly contributes to global climate change, being one of the 
main greenhouse gases. Over the last 300 years, the concentration of carbon dioxide 
in the Earth’s atmosphere has increased by 50% and is currently about 420 ppm [170, 
171]. A further increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere may lead to 
an increase in average temperature. The international community has developed and 
signed documents (The Paris Agreement and The Kyoto Protocol), providing for the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, technologies aimed at reducing 
the content of carbon dioxide are actively being developed, among which carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) technologies have gained the most popularity. The main4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 131 Table 4.5 Different photocatalytic systems based on pyrochlores reported for water splitting Photocatalyst (loading) Preparation method

disadvantages of this technology are high energy costs, as well as environmental 
risks associated with the possibility of CO2 leakage. Therefore, in recent years, 
interest in chemical methods of processing carbon dioxide into valuable products 
has increased. Among these methods, the photocatalytic process, where solar energy 
can be used, appears to be one of the most attractive, along with electrochemical 
reduction (Table 4.6) [172, 173]. 
The main obstacle for the industrial implementation of photocatalytic CO2 reduc￾tion remains the low product yield. Nevertheless, interest in this research topic, as 
well as in the development of other methods of processing carbon dioxide, is steadily 
growing (Fig. 4.15), which is also due to the possibility of obtaining a wide range 
of chemical products (Table 4.7) [174]. An important aspect in the implementation 
of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is the choice of reductant (H2O or H2) [175]. From 
an economic point of view, the use of water is most preferable, but in this case the 
water decomposition reaction may occur competitively, which in most cases reduces 
the yield of reduction products. 
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation has been studied using 
a large number of simple and complex oxides, including TiO2 [176], Ga2O3 [177], 
In2O3 [178], Ta2O5 [179], Bi2MoO6 [180], BiVO4 [181] and others. 
It was recently shown that Bi-containing α-pyrochlores (Bi2Ti2O7, Bi2Zr2O7 and 
Bi2Hf2O7) characterized by cubic symmetry have high chemisorption capacity for

CO2 due to their high surface basicity [182]. The authors suggested that these mate￾rials may exhibit activity in the catalytic, photocatalytic and electrochemical reduc￾tion of CO2. Indeed, some pyrochlores can act as catalysts for the photoreduction of 
CO2. It was shown that the use of pyrochlore-like oxynitride Y2Ta2O5N2 (Eg = 2.1 
eV) doped with silver in combination with ruthenium complexes allows to obtain 
formic acid from carbon dioxide with a selectivity of about 99% [183]. However, the 
rate of HCOOH formation was low and about 3 μmol h–1 gcat –1. Similar results were 
obtained on LnTaOxNy (Ln = Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho) oxynitrides [184]. Higher 
yields were observed using KNbWO6·H2O:xSn2+ (x = 0, 0.163, 0.174, 0.208) [185]. 
The highest rates of CH4 (7.5 μmol h–1 gcat –1), CO (12.5 μmol h–1 gcat –1) and O2 
(20.0 μmol h–1 gcat –1) were achieved using KNbWO6·H2O:0.208Sn2+ (Eg = 2.37 
eV). 
The activity of pyrochlore oxides in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction was also 
studied under UV light [186, 187]. Shao and co-workers [187] found that the 
rate of methanol formation on a NiO/K2Ta2O6 Z-scheme heterojunction can reach 
1815 μmol h–1 gcat –1. Interestingly, a comparison of the activity of NiO/K2Ta2O6 
(pyrochlore) and NiO/KTaO3 (perovskite) showed that the composite based on 
K2Ta2O6 has greater activity, apparently due to a larger specific surface area. It 
should be noted that under visible light irradiation, the activity of hybrids based 
on pyrochlore oxides, e.g., LaDySn2O7/SnSe [188], remains low compared to other 
composites (Table 4.8). Thus, further research in this direction should be focused on 
finding components for creating highly active heterojunction photocatalysts for CO2 
reduction.4 Application of Compounds with Pyrochlore Structure in Photocatalysis 135 Table 4.8 Comparison of the photocatalytic activity of pyrochlores with other semiconductors in CO2 reduction Photocatalyst (loading)

5.1 Natural Polymers for Composites Synthesis 
with Synthetic Polymers for the Production 
of Biomedical Materials 
The need to develop bioartificial organs for replacement or restoration of damaged 
and deformed organs is due to a number of reasons. First, it should be noted that 
for the restoration of affected organs, donor tissues are most often used, which are 
increasingly lacking to meet growing needs. Along with this, there are known side 
effects of transplant rejection. Undoubtedly, the extremely high cost of transplanting 
donor organs is also significant [1–6]. 
All the reasons listed, as well as a number of other problems, have led to the active 
development of numerous strategies for the production of tissue equivalent materials 
and intensive development of research for regenerative medicine. Natural polymers, 
such as collagen (gelatin), polysaccharides, fibrinogen, hyaluronic acid, etc., are 
the basis for hydrogels, since they have very important properties: biocompatibility, 
biodegradability, and water solubility. However, their use as scaffolds is difficult 
without the use of additional techniques for the formation of cross-linked structures. 
In addition, their rapid degradation after the formation of a tissue equivalent material 
based on stem cells is also undesirable. 
In this regard, composite materials based on natural polymers have become widely 
used. Different techniques are exhibited to modify natural polymers, and one of them 
is the grafting of synthetic fragments onto biomacromolecules. As a result of this 
modification, it is possible to improve the physical parameters of materials.

Most of the research on biomaterials for regenerative medicine has been conducted 
suing proteins and polysaccharides. The presented materials of research provide 
results for collagen (gelatin) and pectin. The properties of these natural polymers 
seem necessary to consider in more detail. 
5.1.1 Collagen as a Component of New Composite Materials 
Composite materials obtained from proteins are widely used in obtaining tissue 
equivalent materials, drug delivery, and artificial implants due to their good biocom￾patibility, which indicates a promising prospect in regenerative medicine. Proteins 
are the most physiological and plastic material and most often use collagen (gelatin), 
fibrin, and fibroin [7]. 
Collagen is unique in properties and structure fibrillar protein, which predomi￾nantly prevails in the humans, animals, and fish body. It is present in many tissues 
of the body, but most of all it is found in connective tissues [8]. Collagen is a 
macromolecular particle, which aggregates into three spirally left-handed polypep￾tide chains (Fig. 5.1). In each chain there are 1000–1040 amino acid residues. Amino 
acid composition of collagen is ~30% glycine, ~20% proline, ~10% alanine, and 
~15% hydroxyproline, the rest of the content is represented by other amino acids. 
Among all known proteins, collagen is the only protein containing hydroxyproline. 
The peptide chain of collagen is a spiral, three spirals are twisted together and form 
a dense bundle [9]. This structure is implemented mainly due to hydrogen bonds, 
which are formed as a result of the interaction of oxylisine residues. The tendency 
to spiral twisting of fibrils in the fiber, sometimes fibers in a bundle, is noted in 
many organs and tissues [10]. A characteristic feature of collagen formations is the 
formation of a spiral literally at all levels of organization: a spiral polypeptide chain, 
three-chain superhelix of the collagen molecule, spiral twisting of molecules in the 
primary filament, as well as filaments and subfibrils in the fibril and, finally, frequent 
twisting of fibrils in the fiber and fibers in the bundle [11–13].
It is known that the spiral is one of the most important forms of structural orga￾nization of living matter at the molecular level. And only collagen is characterized 
by a tendency toward spiralization at higher levels. As some scientists believe [14], 
the basis of the “complex range” of biomechanical properties of collagen fibrils 
and filaments lies in a high degree of structural orderliness at the molecular and 
supramolecular levels. 
Many authors [15–19] have repeatedly noted that the existence of a complex 
multi-level network of cross-links of different chemical nature at all structural levels 
of collagen [20] is evidenced by: high tensile strength, stiffness, small amounts 
of relative elongation when stretching tissues, the architecture of which is mainly 
represented by supramolecular collagen formations. 
The process of stabilizing the structure of the collagen molecule during fibril￾logenesis is carried out in a manner typical for all proteins, and with the help of 
specific reactions of the collagen group, which lead to the formation of inter- and5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 149
Fig. 5.1 Structure of collagen fibrils
intramolecular cross-covalent bonds [9, 14, 20]. The bonds that ensure the stable 
configuration of collagen molecules and their aggregates include non-covalent and 
covalent inter-chain bonds [21–23]. Non-covalent bonds include van der Waals forces 
and hydrogen bonds, which ensure the stability of the structure of fibrillar proteins 
[20–22]. There are researchers [16], who note the special role of inter-chain of the 
–CO–HN– bonds formed by carbonyl oxygen and the NH group of the peptide bond. 
Non-covalent bonds that stabilize the structure of collagen also include ionic bonds, 
which are formed when positively and negatively charged ionized groups of basic 
and acidic nature interact. The strong swelling of collagen in solutions of acids and 
alkalis can be explained by the fact that electrostatic bonds are easily broken under 
the influence of substances capable of interacting with ionic groups. 
Intermolecular interaction at the tissue level is due to the presence of cross-links 
between structural elements not only of a non-covalent, but also of a covalent type, 
but their number is very small [24–26]. In collagen, complex ester, aldehyde, ε￾aminolysine, phosphate and other types of bonds have been found. However, this 
does not mean that all the bonds and groups mentioned participate in the stabilization 
of the collagen molecule. 
To date, a number of approaches to the extraction of collagen substances from 
secondary protein-containing raw materials are known [27–29]. 
Fish waste makes up a significant part of secondary resources. The main part of 
proteins containing collagen is concentrated in the cover tissues of fish [30]. Fish 
collagen has a number of advantages compared to animal-derived collagen. Firstly, 
collagen obtained from fish has a greater structural similarity to human collagen, 
which ensures a higher level of biocompatibility [31]. 
Fish and, in general, marine collagen are increasingly replacing collagen from 
terrestrial animals every year. It is 96% similar to human protein, therefore it has 
hypoallergenic properties, as well as transdermal properties. Also, fish collagen mate￾rials are favorably different from similar animal materials in terms of the content of 
chemical elements [32, 33].150 L. L. Semenycheva et al.
Important advantages of collagen are the absence of toxicity and carcinogenicity, 
high mechanical strength, the ability to bind water, the ability to form complexes 
with biologically active substances, stimulation of the regeneration of the body’s 
own tissues [34]. In combination, these properties allow us to count on the extreme 
perspective [30] of using collagen-containing products as components of functional 
food products, biologically active additives, cosmetic and medicine preparation. 
Collagen is a vitally necessary fibrillar protein. It is also the most common protein 
in mammals and makes up 25–35% of proteins throughout the body. The formation 
of cross-covalent bonds provides the mechanical strength of collagen fibers, which 
is one of the most important properties [35]. 
Collagen has already proven itself as a dietary supplement for overall strength￾ening of the human body [31], in pharmacology for the production of medicinal 
forms [36], in cosmetology for increasing the elasticity and resilience of the skin 
[37], in medicine for the development of implants [38] and tissue engineering for 
scaffold construction [39]. 
5.1.2 Polysaccharides as Components of Polymer Composites 
From the point of view of composite properties for regenerative medicine, polysac￾charides (cellulose, hyaluronic acid, starch, alginate, agarose, chitosan, dextran, 
pectin) are among the promising candidates. These materials have excellent biocom￾patibility, anti-inflammatory activity and other important properties for the stated 
purpose [40]. Research on pectin in this direction is also described in the literature 
[40–44]. 
Pectic polysaccharides (pectin) are acidic plant polysaccharides, the main carbo￾hydrate chain of which consists of 1,4-linked residues α-D-galactopyranosyluronic 
acid [39] (Fig. 5.2). 
The acid groups of polygalacturonic acid are partially esterified with methyl 
alcohol. The degree of esterification divides all industrial types of pectins into two 
groups: high-esterified (apple, citrus) and low-esterified (beet). Pectins with a degree 
of esterification equal to or more than 50% are considered high-esterified. The degree 
of esterification affects the resistance to hydrolysis, solubility, jelly formation, and 
other physicochemical properties of the jelly. In addition, low-esterified pectins are 
good absorbents, which are capable of forming complexes with radionuclides with 
subsequent excretion from the body [45–47].
Fig. 5.2 Fragment of the pectin molecule 5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 151
Fig. 5.3 Plant cell wall structure 
Pectins are a part of the structural elements of the cell tissue of higher plants 
(Fig. 5.3). Pectins perform the functions of binding and strengthening components 
of the cell wall, as well as regulate the water exchange of fruits [48]. 
On average, the content of pectic substances in the cell wall of plants is 2–35% 
[49, 50], but its content and structural composition depend on species, parts and 
maturity of plants, growing conditions, and even extraction methods. Most often as 
a pectin-containing raw material they use citrus fruits, apples, sugar beet, Jerusalem 
artichoke, etc. The main components of pectic polysaccharides are polyuronic acids 
[51]. 
In general, pectin mainly consists of three domains: homogalacturonan (HG), 
rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I), and rhamnogalacturonan-II (RG-II), covalently 
linked. HG is a linear homopolymer, containing up to 200 units of α-(1 → 4)-linked 
D-galacturonic acid (GalpA). HG is the most common domain in pectin, making up 
60–65% of the total number of pectin domains. RG-I is called the “hairy” region 
because it contains the most branched and heterogeneous domain, making up about 
20–35% of the total pectin domain. The base of the RG-I domain consists of [→2)-α￾L-Rhap-(1 → 4)-α-D-GalpA-(1 → ] repeating disaccharide units. RG-II is the most 
conservative and complex domain in pectin, containing 12 different monosaccha￾rides and more than 20 types of bonds, making up about 10% of the total number of 
pectin domains. The base of RG-II consists of about nine α-(1 → 4)-linked residues 
of D-GalpA with four heteropolymeric side chains attached at positions C-2 and C-3 
[52]. 
Non-starch polysaccharides are usually divided into low molecular weight (molec￾ular weight less than 10 kDa), medium molecular weight (molecular weight 10–20 
kDa), and high molecular weight (molecular weight more than 20 kDa). Low molec￾ular weight and medium molecular weight polysaccharides, combined by a common152 L. L. Semenycheva et al.
term, oligogalucturonides, are obtained from high molecular weight polymers, using 
enzymatic [53], acidic [54] peroxide and alkaline hydrolysis [55]. 
Gelation is one of the most important properties of pectins, which is influenced by 
various factors, such as temperature, type of pectin, degree of esterification, degree 
of acylation, sugar and other soluble substances, interaction between calcium ions 
and non-esterified carboxyl groups of pectin [56]. High values of molecular weight 
(MW) and characteristic viscosity can significantly enhance the strength of the gel 
[57]. However, data linking MW with characteristic viscosity vary among themselves. 
This is largely due to the compositional heterogeneity of pectin substances, which 
complicates the obtaining of information about the molecular structure of pectin 
substances [58]. 
In low methoxyl pectin, gelation occurs as a result of ionic bonding through 
calcium bridges between two carboxyl groups belonging to two different chains 
in close contact with each other. In high methoxyl pectin, the cross-linking of 
pectin molecules occurs due to a combination of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic 
interactions between molecules [59]. 
Since the rheological properties of pectin are extremely important for determining 
its final application, pectin modifications have recently received a lot of attention. 
The main goal of pectin modification is to change the solubility, rheological, physico￾chemical, and bioactive characteristics. Several approaches, such as chemical, phys￾ical, and enzymatic methods, are used to improve the rheological and gelling prop￾erties of pectin. For example, enzymatic modification under ultrasound leads to the 
formation of pectin oligosaccharides with prebiotic activity. Chemical modification 
is usually preferred due to the simplicity of process control [60]. In addition, in the 
case of chemical modification, the effect of the proposed modification is known. 
Improvement in gel strength and thermal properties was noted when pectin was 
modified with gelatin [61]. Substitution, grafting, elongation, and depolymerization 
using chemical agents and enzymes are some examples of chemical modification 
[62]. Strong depolymerization caused by harsh processing conditions is a major 
drawback of chemical modification, so enzymatic and physical modifications have 
recently attracted more attention [63]. 
5.2 Promising Initiators for Radical Polymerization 
and Grafting onto Polymers 
5.2.1 Peroxides and Azo-Initiators 
Free radical polymerization has proven as one of the most universal and available 
methods for obtaining high molecular weight compounds. The basis for the devel￾opment of large-scale production of polymers by the radical polymerization were 
important achievements in the study of the features of the elementary stages of this 
process, methodological and technical simplicity of its implementation, including5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 153
good reproducibility, low sensitivity, a wide choice of initiators, as well as a wide 
range of monomers capable of polymerization by a radical mechanism [64]. The 
noted simplicity of obtaining polymers determines the low cost of the products 
obtained due to polymers have received widespread use in various spheres of human 
activity. Initiators of radical polymerization usually do not differ in selective action 
in relation to different monomers, therefore the choice of initiator is most often deter￾mined by the conditions of the process: the temperature at which the desired rate of 
free radical generation can be achieved in each specific case, the presence of addi￾tional reagents, requirements for the properties of target products. Peroxide initiators 
(benzoyl peroxide, percarbonates, peresters), and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) are 
used at temperatures above 50 °C. Among the listed initiators, AIBN is the safest 
classic radical initiator, and, in this regard, is widely used in both research work 
and industry. AIBN is soluble in organic solvents, including vinyl monomers, and 
poorly soluble in water. At temperatures above 50 °C, it decomposes into free radicals 
according to Scheme 5.1. Initiation by AIBN, unlike peroxides, is not accompanied 
by side oxidation reactions [64]. 
(5.1) 
There are known works in which AIBN is used to obtain grafted copolymers to 
polymers, for instance, to polypropylene [65] and to natural polymers chitosan [66], 
collagen [67]. 
5.2.2 Redox Systems for Grafting onto Polymers 
Effective initiators of polymerization are various redox systems, the feature of which 
is the low energy of activation of radical formation [68]. 
Initiators based on trialkylboranes are effective and have been studied in detail 
in many polymerization transformations. The presence of a vacant orbital in 
organic boron compounds (OBC) allows them to be agents of complex-radical 
(co)polymerization, a characteristic feature of which is a sharp change in the kinetics 
of the process and the properties of the resulting polymers, while neither the radical 
nature of the active centers nor the chain nature of the process is violated [69–72]. 
The guiding idea for controlling the formation of the polymer chain during complex￾radical polymerization is the use of the known fact of complex formation between 
electron acceptors, in this case the free orbital of boron, and molecules or radicals 
[69, 71–76]. 
Copolymerization of vinyl monomers in the presence of organoelement 
compounds (OEC) is a traditional direction of research by scientists of the Nizhny 
Novgorod State University, which was started under the guidance of Razuvayev G. 
A. and Dodonov V. A. [76–88].154 L. L. Semenycheva et al.
In the 1990s, this direction of regulating the growth of the macrochain was actively 
studied by a team of Nizhny Novgorod scientists, a number of works were carried 
out where the nature of the ongoing process was studied at a concentration of OBC, 
comparable to the concentration of traditional radical initiators. In this case, the 
formation of OEC complexes with radicals, in this case, with polymers, is likely. 
The boron atom, holding the growing macroradical in its coordination sphere, pulls 
the electron density onto itself and, thereby localizing the carbon–carbon bond, 
contributes to the formation of an energetically favorable six-electron system, and 
also facilitates the orientation of reaction centers [76–88]. 
For the first time, systems based on trialkylboranes (TABs) in the presence of 
oxygen air for conducting polymerization were used in 1957 independently by teams 
under the guidance of domestic (G. S. Kolesnikova and L. S. Fedorova) and foreign 
researchers (J. Furukawa and T. Tsuruta) [89–93]. The radical nature of the process 
was definitely proven after some time [94–97]. The peculiarities of the polymeriza￾tion process for a wide range of monomers are described in detail in a recent review 
of own and literature data by M. Yu. Zaremsky with colleagues [98]. 
At the end of the twentieth century, on the wave of general interest in pseudo-living 
processes, T. C. M. Chung and co-workers first noted the features of pseudo-living 
processes in the case of polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) under the 
action of TAB+O2 systems [99–101]. As a reversible termination agent, according to 
the authors, boroxyl radicals act. They are formed according to Schemes (5.2–5.11). 
The schemes described below are confirmed by EPR and NMR and are generally 
accepted today [98]. 
Initiation: 
R3B + O2 −→ R2BOO• + R• (5.2) 
Subsequent reactions: 
R• + O2 −→ ROO• (5.3) 
ROO• + R3B −→ (ROO)BR2 + R• (5.4) 
(ROO)BR2 + R3B −→ R2BOR + R2BO• + R• (5.5) 
(ROO)BR2 + R3B −→ R2BOBR2 + RO• + R• (5.6) 
(ROO)BR2 + O2 −→ (ROO)2BR (5.7) 
(ROO)BR2 + R3B −→ 2(RO)BR2 (5.8) 
(RO)BR2 + O2 −→ (RO)(ROO)BR −→ (RO)3B (5.9)5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 155
(ROO)BR2 −→ R2BO• + RO• (5.10) 
RO• + R3B −→ R2BOR + R• (5.11) 
where R is an alkyl radical. 
The polymerization reaction is initiated by alkyl R• and alkoxy RO• radicals, 
which are formed during the oxidation of TAB [98]. 
The polymerization process on TAB + O2 systems has a number of advantages, 
which make it important from a practical point of view. Firstly, polymerization does 
not require energy expenditure, the reaction proceeds with good yield at room temper￾ature, and in the case of vinyl chloride at a temperature significantly below room 
temperature [98]. Secondly, the process is not afraid of oxygen, and it can be carried 
out in the air. For instance, TAB as a part of amine complexes is used in acrylate 
adhesive compositions, characterized by high adhesion ability to various surfaces 
and high curing speed in the air, together with acrylates they are introduced into 
cement compositions to reduce the time of formwork removal, the initiating system 
tributylborane (TBB) + O2 is used in polymerization filling of PVC with mineral 
fillers [102–104] and others. 
An important property of systems based on trialkylboranes is the possibility 
of macromolecular design, i.e., the synthesis of block, grafted, and functional 
(co)polymers using labile terminal boroxyl groups. The labile boroxyl group in 
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) allows to obtain functionalized and various 
grafted and block copolymers based on it [98, 105, 106]. In the presence of trialkylb￾oranes, grafting is possible due to boronation of collagen by amino acid residues 
according to Scheme 5.12. 
(5.12) 
In this case, as well as when the growing radical of the macromolecule interacts 
with the boroxyl radical, which is formed during the oxidation of trialkylboranes, 
a labile bond is formed and polymerization takes place according to the scheme of 
reversible inhibition (Scheme 5.13) with a significantly lower speed than according 
to Schemes 5.2–5.11. Nevertheless, the contribution of a process needs to be taken 
into account when interpreting the results of syntheses.156 L. L. Semenycheva et al.

5.3 Synthesis of Medical Materials Based on Natural 
Polymers by Grafting Synthetic Polymers 
in the Presence of β-Pyrochlore Oxides 
The search for effective photocatalysts among individual compounds with the absorp￾tion in the visible light is promising, as already noted, for a number of reasons. 
Complex oxides with a β-pyrochlore structure are interesting materials for creating 
various functional materials due to their new unique properties acquired in the 
synthesis process. 
When irradiating a complex oxide, electron–hole pairs are formed, which can lead 
to a series of transformations according to schemes 1–7 in Fig. 5.4 [107]. 
Fig. 5.4 Transformations during photocatalysis5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 157
It is obvious that several chemical reactions can occur simultaneously in the 
reaction mixture of the photocatalyst, monomer and collagen, and the implemen￾tation of one or another chemical reaction is determined by its kinetic parameters 
and the concentration of reacting particles. Studies have been conducted on the 
oxidative polymerization of polyaniline [108, 109] and polypyrrole [110] using 
perovskite oxides, which allowed the creation of original composite materials. 
However, research on radical photo-initiated polymerization and grafting synthetic 
fragments onto natural polymers was virtually absent before our studies, despite 
experimental confirmations of the formation of an active hydroxyl radical in the 
reaction system using radical absorbers, e.g., in the case of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 [111]. 
Alkyl(meth)acrylates (AMA) were chosen as the subjects. 
The reason for this choice was the well-known data on the use of AMA copolymers 
in medical practice. Composite materials including AMA are already widely used in 
medicine, particularly in dentistry for artificial jaws and teeth, for fillings [112], the 
manufacture of prosthetics and contact lenses, and artificial lenses [113]. Copolymers 
of natural polymers with AMA (hyaluronic acid, collagen [114–116] have been used 
as fillers in cosmetology for decades. In recent years, there have been publications 
about the production of materials for regenerative medicine based on copolymers of 
AMA of various nature and natural polymers [117, 118]. 
Before discussing the results of grafting synthetic polymers onto natural polymers 
in the presence of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 it makes sense to present the results of radical poly￾merization of vinyl monomers under these conditions. The research was conducted 
using methyl methacrylate (MMA) as an example. 
5.3.1 Photocatalytic Radical Polymerization of MMA 
in the Presence RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
The process of MMA polymerization was carried out in an aqueous dispersion 
medium at a temperature of 20–25 °C, mixing RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and liquid compo￾nents: water, monomer in a 3:1 ratio. After the process was completed and the solvent 
was added, water, organic phases, and catalyst were analyzed separately [119]. 
From the organic phase, the polymer (5–10% based on the original MMA) was 
precipitated with petroleum ether. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) estab￾lished that the MW values and the polydispersity index (PDI) are of the same order 
as in the photopolymerization of MMA on titanium dioxide powder (Table 5.1) [120, 
121].
However, a feature of the MMA polymerization under these conditions is the 
following. Analysis of the catalyst powder by SEM and EDX showed the presence 
on the surface of a significant amount of polymer fibers (Fig. 5.5b).
For a deeper analysis of the nature of the polymer’s bond with the catalyst powder 
and to isolate the polymer, the powder from the reaction mixture was heated at 50 °C 
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution for 3 h. No significant changes on the catalyst158 L. L. Semenycheva et al.

surface occurred after this operation: polymer fibers were still observed (Fig. 5.5c), 
and no polymer was detected in the THF solution by GPC. 
With a similar purpose, the catalyst after synthesis was subjected to extraction 
with chloroform (temperature of 61 °C) in a Soxhlet extractor for 15 h. However, 
visualization of the catalyst surface even after extraction with chloroform showed 
the presence of polymer fibers (Fig. 5.5d). The polymer was completely removed 
from the catalyst surface by treating the powder with ultrasound for 40 min in the 
presence of water at 20 °C.5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 159
Thus, part of the polymer is not washed off the surface of the complex oxide with 
organic solvents, but is only removed by ultrasonic treatment, i.e., when polymer 
macromolecules are destroyed [122–124]. This indicates that the macromolecules 
are covalently bonded to the surface of RbTe1.5W0.5O6, i.e., the polymer is grafted 
onto the oxide surface according to Scheme 5.14. 
(5.14) 
After extracting the catalyst powder in a Soxhlet extractor, a solid polymer was 
isolated. It was studied by GPC, NMR, and IR spectroscopy. High molecular weight 
products were detected by GPC (see Table 5.1, row 2) with comparable but slightly 
larger polymer MW values compared to the polymer isolated from the organic phase; 
Mn was 140–145 kDa and 200–210 kDa, respectively. According to NMR spec￾troscopy for the polymer, two main signals were observed in the 1H NMR spec￾trum (Fig. 5.6a): singlets at 4.69 and 8.10 ppm with an intensity ratio of 1:1. These 
signals can be attributed to the –OCH2OC(O)– groups and geminal protons at the 
C=C double bond, respectively. In addition, weak signals were detected in the range 
of 0.95–2.50 ppm and 3.65 ppm, which are attributed to the MMA polymer. The 
PMMA content according to these data does not exceed 10% of the main product 
content. In the 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. 5.6b), the main substance has 4 signals: 
62.7 ppm –OCH2O–; 129.7 ppm H2C=C; 133.8 ppm C=C and 165.3 ppm –C(O)O–. 
The two-dimensional C–H correlation spectrum (Fig. 5.6c) confirms that the carbon 
atoms with chemical shifts of 62.7 and 129.7 ppm are directly connected to hydrogen 
atoms. This indicates that the product isolated from chloroform contains compounds 
different from PMMA, which are the result of the polymerization of the MMA oxida￾tion product on the photocatalyst. When analyzing these same chloroform solutions 
by MALDI, organic products were detected. The MW difference of the observed 
reaction products when analyzing it by MALDI is multiple of ~200 (Fig. 5.7) and 
corresponds to the product of oxidative dimerization of MMA on the surface of 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 (Scheme 5.15), which is capable of forming a macromolecular chain 
due to carbon–carbon multiple bonds. 
(5.15)
In the IR spectrum of both PMMA and the product isolated from chloroform 
(Fig. 5.8a), characteristic absorption bands are observed in the range of 1720–1730 
cm–1, corresponding to the valence vibrations of the carboxyl group C=O. This 
confirms both the structure of the MMA polymer present there and the structure of 
the compound obtained as a result of the polymerization of the oxidative dimerization 
product of MMA (Scheme 5.15).
The obtained experimental data allow us to conclude that the transformations of 
MMA in the reaction mixture apparently proceed in several directions:160 L. L. Semenycheva et al.

• With the formation of PMMA in the emulsion due to the initiation of polymer￾ization by the hydroxyl radicals, in this case, regular PMMA with Mn ~140–145 
is formed. 
• With the formation of PMMA by grafting onto the surface of RbTe1.5W0.5O6. This 
happens, apparently, for the following reasons. It is well known [125–127] that 
metal oxides always have the OH groups on the surface, accordingly, the properties 
of the OH groups, depending on the nature of the metal, can significantly differ. In 
this case, the hydroxyl radicals formed during photo-initiation can interact with the 
surface OH group, as a result of which a significantly more stable oxygen-centered 
radical appears on the surface of the oxide, which can also initiate polymerization. 
The lifetime of the hydroxyl radical is very short, the path of polymer formation 
by grafting onto the oxide surface becomes more likely. The polymer formed on 
the surface prevents migration of radicals from the surface of the powder into the 
reaction mixture. 
• The monomer interacts with RbTe1.5W0.5O6 forming a coordination complex due 
to the double bonds of the monomer and vacant metal orbitals. Coordination to 
the carbonyl group and the double bond of the monomer is considered equally 
likely [128–130], in this case, its oxidation to the dimer (Scheme 5.15) by the 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 photocatalyst can be assumed. 
The schematic reactions in the mixture of the catalyst with the monomer, including 
in the presence of a natural polymer, are shown in Fig. 5.9.
The products of MMA transformations during the irradiation of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
were partially isolated during extraction with chloroform in a Soxhlet extractor.162 L. L. Semenycheva et al.
Fig. 5.8 IR spectra: a product from synthesis (1), PMMA (2); b pectin (1), PMMA (2) and pectin– 
PMMA graft copolymer (3)
According to GPC, NMR, and MALDI, this is a mixture of PMMA and the polymer 
product of oxidative dimerization of MMA. 
The presented data confirm the known views that the hydroxyl radicals are very 
active in reactions of hydrogen atom abstraction from the C–H and O–H bonds. 
Accordingly, they should show high activity in relation to all similar bonds, e.g., in 
natural polymers, proteins, and polysaccharides. As already noted, the production 
of grafted copolymers of natural polymers with synthetic polymers is especially 
promising for obtaining new materials for medicine, including tissue engineering.5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 163

5.3.2 Radical Graft Copolymerization of Alkyl Methacrylates 
with Fish Collagen in the Presence 
of the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 Photocatalyst 
As already noted earlier, for the production of medical polymers, AMAs of various 
nature are grafted onto natural polymers. In this case, as model objects, MMA and 
butyl acrylate (BA) were used. The photocatalytic graft copolymerization of MMA 
onto fish collagen in the presence of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 was conducted at a temperature 
of 20–25 °C. Collagen dissolved in water is a nonionic emulsifier and at the same 
time a reagent that should interact with initiating radicals [131]. Under the chosen 
conditions, the grafting of MMA onto fish collagen should be carried out due to the 
reaction of radical substitution by the hydroxyl radicals, formed under visible light 
(λ = 400–700 nm) [107], with a hydrogen atom from collagen macromolecules. This 
interaction is possible with the hydroxyl group of the amino acid residue according 
to Scheme (5.15) (using hydroxyproline as an example) or with the hydrogen atom of 
the hydrocarbon chain of the amino acid residue molecule according to Scheme 5.16 
(using serine as an example), which will lead to the formation of a more stable than 
the hydroxyl radical oxygen- or carbon-centered radical, respectively. 
It is known that the structural elements of collagen are amino acid residues 
with hydrocarbon fragments, as well as containing a hydroxyl group (hydroxypro￾line (~15%), serine (~4%), hydroxylysine (~1%) [132]. As a result of interaction164 L. L. Semenycheva et al.
according to Schemes 5.16 and 5.17, radicals are formed on the surface of the protein, 
through which the grafting of PMMA onto collagen can occur: 
The analysis of the polymer product extracted from the aqueous phase of the 
synthesis indicates the formation of a grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer. The 
molecular weight of the original sample was noticeably increased: from Mn 240 to 
270 kDa, while the polydispersity index was not changed (Table 5.2). In Fig. 5.10a, 
a shift of the molecular weight distribution (MWD) curve toward the high molec￾ular weight region is evident. This is clear evidence of the grafting of MMA onto 
collagen. Moreover, the nitrogen content in the grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer 
after synthesis was noticeably decreased compared to the original collagen sample 
(Table 5.2) and is ~70%. 
It is quite possible that if small amounts of PMMA are formed in the emulsion 
during synthesis along with the grafting of MMA to collagen, they may remain in 
the sample of the grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer due to intermolecular inter￾action. However, prolonged extraction of the grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer 
with chloroform in a Soxhlet extractor did not lead to a noticeable change in mass

or a change in nitrogen content (Table 5.2), indicating the absence of non-covalently 
bound PMMA in the polymer product. 
This fact is supplemented by evidence of the absence of PMMA in the chloroform 
extract by GPC and MALDI. In the case of the latter study, in the chloroform extract 
of the polymer product (Fig. 5.11a), as in the extract of the organic phase of synthesis 
with toluene (Fig. 5.11b), organic derivatives different from MMA were found. 
The difference in MW of the observed reaction products is approximately ~200 
and corresponds to the product of oxidative dimerization of MMA on the surface 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 oxide (Scheme 5.15). 
By GPC method, MMA (product of thermal destruction of PMMA [124] was 
not found in the chloroform extract, but compounds with a molecular weight greater 
than 100 are present. The listed data of the analysis of the organic phase of synthesis 
and extracts of the graft product indicate the formation of MMA transformations 
products not according to the usual scheme of its radical polymerization, but appar￾ently according to Scheme 5.15, part of which is adsorbed on the grafted PMMA￾collagen copolymer. These data indicate a difference in the process of formation of 
polymer products, occurring under visible light irradiation (λ = 400–700 nm) of 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6, from syntheses in the presence of traditional radical initiators and 
tributylborane with an oxidizer, when PMMA is always formed in the organic phase 
[68, 134, 135]. 
In order to confirm the presence in the grafted collagen–PMMA copolymer of 
fragments of natural and synthetic polymer, films of original collagen, PMMA, and 
grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer were obtained, for which IR spectroscopy was 
carried out (Fig. 5.10b).
The IR spectrum of the collagen film had characteristic protein absorption bands 
in the regions, each of which corresponds to vibrations: 1600–1700 cm–1 for the 
NH– and C=O– bonds; 1510–1570 cm–1 for plane deformation vibrations of the NH– 
bonds; 1200–1350 cm–1 for deformation vibrations of the C–N, NH– bonds; 1720– 
1730 cm–1 for valence vibrations of the C=O group. The IR spectrum of PMMA also 
had a characteristic absorption band in the region of 1720–1730 cm–1, corresponding 
to the valence vibrations of the carboxyl group. Comparing the IR spectrum of the 
grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer with the IR spectra of collagen and PMMA 
shows that all bands characteristic of collagen and PMMA are observed for the 
grafted copolymer. 
SEM analysis allowed to establish morphological differences between the original 
collagen and the grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer, indicating the inclusion of 
synthetic polymer fragments in the fibrillar organization of collagen. Thus, if a clearly 
expressed fibrous structure is visible on the collagen film (Fig. 5.12a), then the film of 
the grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer has a more complex surface (Fig. 5.12b). The 
collagen sponge has clear outlines of collagen fibers and formed pores (Fig. 5.12b), 
while in the micrograph of the grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer, a denser structure 
of collagen fibers with grafted synthetic polymer is clearly visible (Fig. 5.12c).
The revealed morphological features of the grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer 
serve as a basis for conducting research on it as a material for scaffolds. The absence166 L. L. Semenycheva et al.

5.3.2.1 Features of MMA Copolymers on Fish Collagen Under 
Photocatalysis in the Presence of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 in Relation 
to the Impact of Fungi 
SEM analysis of the grafted PMMA-collagen copolymer allowed to establish not 
only the morphological differences of the original collagen, but also to detect in the 
polymer microparticles of the catalyst, which are clearly visible at high magnification 
of the copolymer film surface (Fig. 5.13).
Apparently, during the synthesis of the grafted collagen copolymer with MMA, 
the solid catalyst in nano-quantities is adsorbed by the synthesized copolymer and 
does not separate from it during centrifugation. It turned out that as a result of the 
photocatalyst adsorption, the collagen-PMMA copolymer acquires fungus-resistant 
properties [136]. The polymer film was tested for fungus resistance according to5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 167

The results of the study of collagen-PMMA copolymer films, confirming its 
fungus resistance, are of undoubted practical interest. It is known that the devel￾opment of materials with fungicidal properties is of enduring importance. Prod￾ucts made of polymer materials, especially with the incorporation of natural high￾molecular compounds, are subject to serious damage or even almost complete 
destruction by fungi, which can use them as sources of nutrition. Microorganisms 
actively interact with plastic materials, while the manifestations of this can vary, 
namely: pigmentation, surface change, change in physical and chemical properties, 
etc. To prevent material damage, fungicidal additives are most often introduced. 
The main task of these additives is to suppress the growth of fungi and prevent 
the destruction of plastics. Fungicidal additives give plastics the ability to maintain 
surface sterility for a long time and prevent the process of bio-damage. Among the 
first additives to polymers were compounds, including metals and metalloids: arsenic, 
sulfur, mercury, or copper, e.g., Bordeaux liquid. Then, research was started that led 
to the production of organic fungicides. Usually, these are organic low-molecular, 
easily migrating compounds, sometimes containing a metal ion. Among the main 
organic compounds can be named: 10-oxibisphenoxiarsin (OBRA); trichlorohydrox￾ydiphenylether (Triclosan); n-octylisothiazolinone (OIT); 4,5-dichlor-2-n-octyl-4-
isothiazolin-3-one (DCOIT); mercaptopyridine oxide (Pyrithione) [137]. The use of 
8-hydroxyquinolinate zinc for obtaining an agricultural bactericide is disclosed in 
the patent [138]. The agricultural bactericide obtained using 8-hydroxyquinolinate 
zinc as an active ingredient has a broad bactericidal spectrum and can be used 
not only to combat fungal diseases. There are known polymers with antimicro￾bial properties (polyphosphonates, poly-N-halogenpyridine, poly(styrene–divinyl￾benzene)sulfamide, etc.) [137, 139]. In addition, inventions [140, 141] reveal the 
antifungal activity of carboxylic acid compounds. 
Currently, inorganic additives, i.e., metal compounds, most often silver oxides, 
zinc in micro- and even nanoconcentrations [142], metal-containing tin silver 
compounds [137] are widely used. 
The authors [142] noted that nanoparticles of metals and metal oxides are 
promising antibacterial agents. They have broad antimicrobial activity against 
bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, and also help to avoid the development of 
microbial resistance. In addition, there are examples of forming double and triple 
nanocomposites based on oxides: CuO, ZnO, Fe3O4, Ag2O, MnO2, and a number of 
others, including those doped with various metals/non-metals: Ag, Ce, Cr, Mn, Nd, 
Co, Sn, Fe, N, F, etc. The results of research on multicomponent systems demonstrate 
their more pronounced antibacterial activity and synergistic effect compared to the 
activity of individual oxides. For instance, triple nanocomposites ZnO–MnO2–Cu2O 
or ZnO–Ag2O–Ag2S showed an increase in the zone of inhibition of growth of test 
strains of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms by 100% compared to 
ZnO. The same doubled antibacterial effect was observed for ZnO nanoparticles 
doped with Ce or for CuO, doped with Zn. Most often, the considered nanocompos￾ites and their combinations have a pronounced prolonged antimicrobial effect, have 
low toxicity in relation to eukaryotic cells, in compositions with polymers (sodium 
alginate, collagen, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc.) demonstrate anti-inflammatory and170 L. L. Semenycheva et al.
wound healing properties. The use of nanoscale systems can solve several important 
practical tasks at once, such as maintaining high prolonged antimicrobial activity 
while reducing the number of used compounds, creating new antimicrobial drugs 
with low toxicity and reduced environmental load on the environment, develop￾ment of new biocidal materials, including new coatings for effective antimicrobial 
protection of medical devices. 
To ensure fungicidal properties, specially selected concentrations of biocides are 
introduced into polymer enamels [143]. However, almost any additives assume an 
additional stage in the material manufacturing technology, providing a uniform distri￾bution of a special antifungal additive. There is a method of applying an antifungal 
drug to the surface of a polymer product. A multilayer polymer material is treated 
with a fluorocarbon surface composition to provide water-repellent properties, and 
resistance to ultraviolet irradiation and mold [144]. The disadvantages of this method 
are the presence of an additional stage in the technology of obtaining the material, 
and the unevenness of the coating. 
When obtaining a biocidal food film with silver nanolayers, the additive was 
applied to the surface by magnetron sputtering [145]. The disadvantages of this 
method are the presence of an additional stage in the preparation technology, the use 
of expensive equipment for sputtering, and unevenness of the coating. 
A method was proposed to prevent mold by not only adding to the composition 
of the material, but also periodic treatment of the surface of the product with this 
composition [146], or only applying to the outer surface [147]. The disadvantages of 
these methods are the presence of an additional stage in the preparation technology 
and unevenness of the coating. More known technologies introduce an antimicrobial 
additive during the manufacturing process of the material [148, 149]. In addition, 
the modifying bactericidal composition (an aqueous solution of triclosan) in biocidal 
polyethylene terephthalate films is introduced into the composition at the stage film 
formation [150]. The disadvantage of this method is the presence of an additional 
stage in the preparation technology and changing some properties of the final product. 
Propylene threads were obtained with modified nanosized Cu-containing powders, 
introducing a bacterial additive at the stage of molding [151]. A method is described 
[152] after preliminary ultrasonic treatment with the aim of activating the surface 
of the material, it is immersed in a solution or sprayed with a solution containing 
pre-prepared nanosized colloidal particles of metals or oxides with a concentration 
of 0.1–5% by weight of the material, followed by drying the material at a temperature 
from 60 to 100 °C until constant weight. The solution, which is sprayed or in which 
the material is immersed, is a water or water-alcohol dispersion containing colloidal 
particles (nanoparticles of copper, iron, tantalum, silver, zinc oxide, titanium, and 
vanadium with a mass fraction from 0.1 to 5%). The synthesis of nanoparticles in the 
solution occurs as a result of melting, evaporation of the surface of metal electrodes 
under the action of an electric arc discharge, which occurs when creating variable 
pulse potential differences from 5 to 9 kW and subsequent condensation in a liquid 
condensed phase. A distinctive feature of the nanoparticles obtained in the water or 
water-alcohol phase is that the sizes of nanoparticles are in the range from 1 to 20 
nm.5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 171
The cited literature data underline the originality of the new fungus-resistant 
material—a grafted copolymer of methyl methacrylate on collagen with fungicidal 
properties by using RbTe1.5W0.5O6, which performs simultaneously the functions 
of a catalyst of the process, and nano-quantities of it with particle sizes ≤2 nm, 
adsorbed by the polymer after separation from the catalyst, perform the functions of 
an antifungal additive. 
5.3.2.2 Changes in the Surface of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 after Catalyzing 
Copolymerization of Methyl Methacrylate with Collagen 
Special attention in the development of new methods of obtaining polymeric mate￾rials deserves the stability and reusability of a catalyst. These studies have been 
conducted for many catalysts that have a practical orientation of research. For 
instance, the reusability of catalysts Ag3PO4–Guar gum [153], Fe3O4/CeO2/g–C3N4 
[154], SiO2/WO3–TiO2@RGO [128] is possible for several cycles with a small loss 
of activity after solvent treatment and calcination. Accordingly, the study of the 
possibility of reusing the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 complex oxide is relevant. 
To solve this issue, reusability experiments using RbTe1.5W0.5O6 in the polymer￾ization of MMA were conducted [155]. For a deeper analysis of the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
surface and studying the adsorption of organic substrates during photocatalytic poly￾merization in a heterogeneous mixture of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and MMA emulsion in 
water under visible light (λ = 400–700 nm) at a temperature of 20–25 °C, X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used, which allows to qualitatively and quan￾titatively determine the chemical composition of compounds on the near-surface 
layer with a thickness of 1–2 nm [107]. 
As noted earlier (Sect. 5.3.1), analysis of the catalyst powder after the MMA 
polymerization reaction by SEM demonstrated the presence on the surface of a 
significant amount of polymer fibers with a length of up to 200–700 μm, as well as 
smaller organic particles with a size of 5–10 μm (Fig. 5.5b–d). 
The study of the catalyst powder surface by SEM after washing in THF and 
chloroform, as already noted [87, 119], showed the presence of polymer fibers and 
organics (Fig. 5.5c, d). However, after washing in water using ultrasound and subse￾quent drying in vacuum, polymer fibers on the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 surface were not 
identified by SEM. Nevertheless, this powder when reused demonstrated a signifi￾cant decrease in its efficiency in the synthesis of a polymer based on MMA. When 
reused catalyst powder after treating with ultrasound for 40 min in the presence of 
water at 20 °C and drying in a vacuum, PMMA was obtained with a conversion of less 
than 5% (when using fresh powder, it is possible to obtain ~5–10% of the polymer) 
[156]. Obviously, the change in the efficiency of the photocatalyst is associated with 
changes in the surface of RbTe1.5W0.5O6, which are not identified by SEM. 
A deeper XPS study of the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 surface after all listed treating methods 
showed that in the case of all RbTe1.5W0.5O6 samples there is a shift of the photoelec￾tron lines of Rb, Te, W metals toward higher binding energies relative to the freshly 
obtained compound [153, 157]. This shift can characterize their surface bonds as172 L. L. Semenycheva et al.
predominantly connected with oxygen, i.e., all atoms on the surface after the poly￾merization and treating carried out are in an oxidized state in the form of “M–O–”. 
The photoelectron lines C 1s and O 1s for the original catalyst powder show the pres￾ence on the surface of a characteristic small amount of adsorbed organic contaminants 
and CO2. 
Deconvolution of the photoelectron lines of carbon C 1s and oxygen O 1s demon￾strated that on the surface of the powder washed in an ultrasonic bath chemically 
adsorbed MMA and its oligomers are present [153]: contributions of C–C (285 eV), 
C–C=O (285.75 eV), C–O (286.7 eV), O–C=O (289.1 eV) bonds correspond as 
2.4:1:0.7:0.4 (Fig. 5.14, Table 5.3).
A slight change in the ratio of peaks compared to pure PMMA (2:1:1:1) in the 
C 1s line occurs due to the influence of the metals of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 connected 
through oxygen with the carbon of the MMA molecule on the distribution of electron 
density along its bonds. In addition to the chemical bonds of MMA, on the surface 
of the photocatalyst there is a small excess of C=O bonds (ether group), as well 
as at the impurity level, potassium (in the form of a doublet), which got on the 
surface of the catalyst from the emulsifier, and C–F bonds, associated with storing 
samples in polyethylene bags. Thus, although treatment of the powder in an ultrasonic 
disperser leads to the destruction of large, catalyst-bound macromolecules, observed 
by the SEM method, the monomer and oligomers, formed during the destruction of 
macromolecules by ultrasound, form chemical bonds with the catalyst and remain 
on its surface. At the same time, polymer macromolecules are not identified, as in 
the analysis by SEM. 
After prolonged extraction with chloroform, a part of the MMA and OMMA 
(oligomeric particles) macromolecules, formed in the reaction mixture, migrates into 
the chloroform solution. It was noted that MMA and OMMA polymers were also 
identified by 13C NMR and MALDI in chloroform after washing the photocatalyst 
powder [119]. However, a significant part of these molecules remains on the surface 
of the catalyst and is detected by SEM (Fig. 5.5d). Despite this, the analysis of 
the photocatalyst powder, washed in chloroform at the boiling temperature (61 °C) 
immediately after the synthesis of the polymer, by XPS method showed the absence of 
PMMA and MMA molecules on the surface. In this case, the photoelectron carbon 
line gives a distribution of intensities of bond contributions, not corresponding to 
MMA. There is a significant increase in the contribution of the C=O bonds to the ether 
group and C–O–R and the appearance of the CO3 
2– groups on the surface (Fig. 5.14, 
Table 5.3), which can be attributed to the oxidation products of polymer molecules 
and monomers. Although large macromolecules remain bound to the photocatalyst 
powder after chloroform treatment, the surface layer of adsorbed MMA is noticeably 
oxidized. 
After washing the powder with THF solution, polymer molecules (Fig. 5.5c) 
are visible on SEM images, however, they are not identified on the surface of the 
catalyst by the XPS method. Potassium from the emulsifier (Fig. 5.14, Table 5.3) is 
also present on the surface. The proportion of the C–C and C–H bonds on the surface 
of the photocatalyst increases significantly compared to other two samples. Probably,5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 173

excess of THF is adsorbed on the catalyst surface with ring opening according to the 
scheme in Fig. 5.15 [154].
The study of the catalyst samples composition in depth during ion profiling showed 
that after 2–4 nm adsorbed monomers and oligomers in the C 1s line are absent. In 
the photoelectron line O 1s, contributions of the C–O and C=O bonds are also absent. 
This indicates that MMA molecules and oligomers are adsorbed only on the catalyst 
surface and form a layer no more than 1–2 nm thick. 
In general, the following features of changes on the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 surface after 
photocatalysis of methyl methacrylate polymerization should be highlighted: from 
the previous study of the surface and photocatalytic properties of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
it is known that the surface of the compound is enriched with Rb atoms due to 
their migration from the bulk to the surface along the channels of the crystal lattice. 
This leads to the emergence of a small positive charge on the surface of the powder 
particles, which in aqueous solution adsorbs water and OH–. Thus, the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
surface in solution has a partially negative charge, which is confirmed by the increased 
adsorption of cationic dyes by the catalyst surface (Fig. 5.16). In addition, Te and 
W atoms are present on the surface, which are also capable of adsorbing water to5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 175
Fig. 5.15 Mechanism of adsorption of the THF molecule on the catalyst surface
form –(Te/W)–OH and –(Te/W)–O–, however, their contribution to the surface state 
is less due to the smaller number of atoms on the surface. 
After the polymerization reaction, the metal atoms on the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 surface 
are in an oxidized state. This means that the –M–O• active centers, from which the 
process of radical polymerization began, are occupied. After treating the powder 
with ultrasound, polymer macromolecules are destroyed, while oligomers can still 
occupy the –M–O• active centers. In addition, due to multiple bonds in the monomer 
and polymer, there is an interaction of organic substrates with RbTe1.5W0.5O6 to 
form coordination complexes [128–130], which prevent the release of the hydroxyl 
radicals into the monomer solution. These features in the reaction mixture explain 
the small yield of PMMA (5–10%) in the solution after the reaction. Probably, when
Fig. 5.16 Types of adsorbed particles on the catalyst surface in an aqueous solution 176 L. L. Semenycheva et al.
forming and growing the chain of MMA and OMMA oligomers on the catalyst 
surface, the process of interaction of electron–hole pairs with water becomes ster￾ically difficult, and reactions (2), (4)–(7) (Fig. 5.4) practically stop. On the other 
hand, increasing the path of electron migration along the PMMA molecule chain 
from the catalyst to the radical center in the solution increases the probability of the 
electron–hole pair recombination. This leads to a sharp decrease in the number of 
active particles and formed radicals, and therefore, to a slowdown and stop of the 
polymerization reaction on the surface and in the solution. 
Thus, for the regeneration of the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 photocatalyst treating its aqueous 
solution with ultrasound is not sufficient. This was shown by XPS studies, as well as 
a decrease in the efficiency of MMA polymerization processes and grafting MMA 
onto collagen and pectin. 
To remove organic molecules from the catalyst surface, RbTe1.5W0.5O6 was 
calcined at a temperature of 300–400 °C after ultrasonic treatment. After the treat￾ment, the process of MMA polymerization leads to the release of polymer with a 
conversion of ~5%, i.e., practically the same as with a fresh catalyst. This is associated 
with the restoration of the chemical state of metals and their quantitative distribution 
on the surface. Also, the surface is treated from organic compounds (reagents and 
products of the polymerization), which is evident from the restoration of deconvolu￾tion of photoelectron lines C 1s and O 1s for the annealed sample to a state close to 
the original, except for the presence of a small amount of C=C bonds (~284.2 eV). 
5.3.2.3 Fish Gelatin as an Alternative to Fish Collagen in Hybrid 
Materials for Regenerative Medicine 
The previously presented results on the synthesis of grafted copolymers of MMA with 
fish collagen have significant potential for practical development of new materials for 
regenerative medicine. However, it should be emphasized that collagen is a thermally 
unstable polymer: at temperatures above 30–40 °C, its denaturation begins with the 
formation of gelatin [132, 158–162]. 
Comparison of the characteristics of cod collagen (CC) and gelatin (G) in the 
presence of the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 photocatalyst are presented in this Sub-section. In the 
aqueous phase after synthesis with the participation of gelatin, a polymer was found. 
The mass of the polymer increased compared to the initial by 10–15%, while the 
MW increased compared to the original sample by 12–13%, and the polydispersity 
index did not change. In addition, the nitrogen content in the grafted copolymer 
PMMA-G after synthesis significantly decreased compared to the original gelatin 
sample. Figure 5.17 shows comparative data of these characteristics in comparison 
with the grafted polymer onto CC.
The visualized morphology of the lyophilically dried sponge sample of the 
aqueous phase of the grafted copolymer PMMA-G is presented in comparison with 
the same for the grafted copolymer PMMA-CC in Fig. 5.18.
When considering the microstructure of lyophilically dried samples of copoly￾mers, it can be noted that they have a three-dimensional network structure, typical5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 177

for scaffolds. Sponges have clear outlines of protein fibers and formed pores and 
have the prospect of testing in scaffold technologies. At the same time, the absence 
of fragments of the organic nature initiator, characteristic of grafted copolymers with 
traditional initiators, is important. 
Overall, based on the results, it should be concluded that the properties of cod 
gelatin compared to collagen in catalytic processes: enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins178 L. L. Semenycheva et al.
and photocatalytic synthesis and properties of their grafted copolymers with PMMA 
differ insignificantly. 
5.3.2.4 Synthesis of Grafted Copolymers of BA onto Fish Collagen 
in the Presence of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
BA grafting onto fish collagen was carried out under the same conditions as in the 
case of MMA [119]: at a temperature of 20–25 °C under visible light irradiation (λ
= 400–700 nm) in a dispersion of BA and collagen in the presence of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
in an argon flow with intensive stirring. 
It is obvious that several chemical reactions can occur simultaneously in the 
reaction mixture of the photocatalyst, monomer and collagen, and the implementation 
of one or another chemical reaction is determined by its kinetic parameters and the 
concentration of reacting particles [163]. 
Despite the fact that the hydroxyl radicals have a high reactivity, as in the case of 
MMA [119], the radical polymerization with the formation of a grafted copolymer 
of BA does not proceed quantitatively: only a portion of the synthetic monomer is 
grafted onto collagen. As a result, the mass of the grafted copolymer after extrac￾tion from the reaction mixture is 25–30% greater than the original collagen, which 
indicates the grafting of BA onto collagen. Unlike the synthesis processes of grafted 
BA copolymers onto collagen, previously conducted with AIBN and triethylborane￾oxygen, when along with the grafted copolymer, the formation of significant amounts 
of BA homopolymer took place [164], when using RbTe1.5W0.5O6 it was not possible 
to extract and characterize significant amounts of PBA from the organic phase. BA 
remains in the organic phase unreacted. 
The formation of the grafted copolymer is confirmed by the molecular weight 
characteristics (Fig. 5.19, Table 5.4) of the obtained grafted BA copolymer onto 
collagen compared to the original collagen: there is an increase in the MW of the 
obtained material. According to the elemental analysis of samples of the grafted BA 
copolymer (Table 5.4), the nitrogen content of amino acid residues in them due to 
the grafting of BA is noticeably less than in collagen.
In Table 5.4, the MW values and elemental analysis of samples of the grafted 
MMA polymer onto collagen from Sect. 5.3.2.1 are given for comparison. It can 
be seen that under comparable conditions of photocatalysis in the presence of 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 the proportion of grafted acrylate is comparable for MMA and BA, 
although the activity of these monomers and their radicals are noticeably different 
[98]. When comparing the microstructure of films and sponges of the original 
collagen, respectively (Fig. 5.20a, c), and the obtained grafted BA copolymer onto 
collagen (Fig. 5.20b, d) it can be seen that the copolymer extracted from the emulsion 
has a more complex structural-relief organization. 
As in the case of the synthesis of the grafted PMMA copolymer onto collagen, the 
analysis of the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 surface after the synthesis of the grafted PBA-collagen 
copolymer by electron microscopy allowed to detect on its surface fragments of5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 179

5.3.2.5 Radical Graft Copolymerization of Alkyl Methacrylates 
with Pectin in the Presence of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
Previously, the radical graft copolymerization of alkyl methacrylates under photocat￾alytic conditions in the presence of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with fish collagen was described. 
As already noted earlier, in composite materials for regenerative medicine, polysac￾charides are successfully used [40–42]. This sub-section presents data on the activity 
of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 in the graft copolymerization of MMA on the example of the 
polysaccharide pectin. 
The grafting of MMA onto pectin was carried out under conditions similar to the 
copolymerization of MMA with collagen at 20–25 °C. The analysis of the polymer 
product extracted from the aqueous phase of the synthesis indicates the formation 
of the grafted PMMA-pectin copolymer. The mass of the product from the aqueous180 L. L. Semenycheva et al.

phase of synthesis compared to the mass of the original pectin increased by 15–20%. 
Significant changes occurred in the molecular weight parameters of the copolymer 
compared to the original pectin (Table 5.5).
The content of the low molecular weight fraction with Mn = 0.3 kDa decreased 
by 10%, while the content of the fraction with MW of about 11–12 kDa increased 
by 7%, and with MW of about 20–21 kDa—by 3%. Obviously, this happened due to5 Synthesis of Composites Based on Natural and Synthetic Polymers … 181

the grafting of MMA to pectin due to the removal of hydrogen atoms from the C–H 
and O–H bonds. 
For analysis by IR spectroscopy, films of the original pectin, PMMA, and the 
grafted copolymer pectin-PMMA were obtained. Figure 5.8b shows the obtained IR 
spectra. The IR spectrum of the pectin film has characteristic absorption bands in the 
areas: 3000–3600 cm–1 corresponding to OH oscillations; 1750–1400 (1750–1730) 
cm−1 corresponding to valence oscillations of the carboxyl group; 0.1250–1400 cm–1 
corresponding to OH oscillations; 1000–1200 and 400–850 cm–1 corresponding to 
pulsating oscillations of pyranose rings. In the IR spectrum of PMMA, the absorption 
band in the region of 1720–1730 cm–1, corresponding to valence oscillations of the 
carboxyl group, is also characteristic. Comparing the IR spectrum of the grafted 
copolymer PMMA-pectin with the IR spectra of pectin and PMMA indicates that all 
the bands characteristic of pectin and PMMA are observed for it, which is additional 
confirmation of the formation of the grafted copolymer. 
SEM analysis allowed to establish the morphological differences of the original 
pectin and the grafted copolymer pectin-PMMA, indicating the incorporation of frag￾ments of synthetic polymer in the fibrillar organization of pectin. The pectin sponge 
has clear outlines of fibrils and formed pores (Fig. 5.21a), while a more complex 
structural-relief organization between the pectin fibers with noticeably denser fibers 
of the grafted copolymer is clearly visible for the grafted copolymer PMMA-pectin 
(Fig. 5.21b).
5.3.3 A Short Overview 
Thus, as a result of photocatalysis under visible light irradiation in the presence 
of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 it was possible to obtain grafted copolymers of alkyl methacry￾lates with fish collagen and pectin. Copolymers were isolated and characterized by 
physicochemical methods. These composite materials based on natural and synthetic 
polymers due to their structure, composition, and other characteristics are particularly 
promising for application in regenerative medicine.182 L. L. Semenycheva et al.

Antimicrobial Effect of Nano￾and Sub-micron Particles of Metal 
Oxides with β-Pyrochlore Structure 
V. F. Smirnov , O. N. Smirnova , N. A. Anikina , and A. Yu. Shishkin 
6.1 Antimicrobial Activity of Nano- and Sub-micron 
Particles of Metal Oxides 
Among biocidal preparations, substances based on metal oxides (ZnO, TiO2, CuO, 
etc.) are widely used. These compounds are capable of suppressing the vital activity 
of bacteria, fungi, algae and are used in medicine, veterinary medicine, agriculture, 
as well as protecting industrial materials from bio-damage and biofouling [1, 2]. 
Among such antimicrobial preparations, more and more attention is paid to finely 
dispersed micro- and nanosized particles of metal oxides [3, 4]. Some of these 
compounds possess photocatalytic activity, i.e., when light is applied to them in 
various spectral regions, an increase in antimicrobial effect takes place [3, 5, 6]. 
According to the nomenclature of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chem￾istry (IUPAC), a microparticle is a particle ranging in size from 1 × 10–7 to 10–4 m. 
The size range of microparticles specified in the definition is usually expressed in μm 
(in other words, from 0.1 μm to 100 μm) [7]. At such particle size, physicochemical 
properties significantly change or new unique qualities are acquired [8, 9]. 
The biocidal action of photocatalytically active microparticles of metal oxides 
depends on a number of factors: particle size, their concentration and morphology, 
band gap, light source intensity, nature of the metal, and type of biological object [3, 
10, 11]. The presence of photocatalytic activity allows the creation of a new genera￾tion of biocidal and disinfecting agents with controlled antimicrobial effect both in 
terms of the intensity of biocidal action, and in terms of selectivity toward types of 
microorganisms [3]. Such oxide nanoparticles are recognized as effective antimicro￾bial agents due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and nano-sized structure, which 
allow them to cause damage of microbial cells.

Comparative analysis of the antimicrobial activity of various oxide microparticles 
is quite difficult due to different types of used materials. For example, titanium 
oxide in the literature is presented in the form of spherical particles, nanotubes, 
nanobelts, nanorods, and nanofibers; silver oxide—in the form of nanospheres, disks, 
and triangles. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of metal nanoparticles is greatly 
affected by the phenomenon of aggregation, which reduces the surface interaction 
between nanoparticles and the bacterial membranes. Metal oxide nanoparticles tend 
to turn into larger aggregates in the absence of stabilizing agents. 
Light irradiation of photoactive metal oxide nanoparticles significantly enhances 
their antibacterial effect, although inhibition of microorganisms growth is observed 
even in dark conditions. Increasing the intensity of illumination enhances the antibac￾terial effect, but depending on the type of organism, the degree of toxicity varies under 
different conditions [11]. Thus, in the study [12] it was shown that the illumination 
of tungsten oxide nanoparticles (WO3) significantly increases their toxicity towards 
bacterial cells and mammalian cells, while fungi under the same conditions were less 
sensitive to the action of tungsten oxide nanoparticles. In addition, a dependence of 
the toxic effect on the time and dose of radiation was shown. 
It is important that the photocatalytic reaction rate is proportional to the intensity 
of radiation only up to a certain value. Thus, the authors [13] demonstrated that 
the reaction rate is proportional to the radiation flux up to a value of 25 mW/cm2, 
but above this value it changes proportionally to the intensity to the power of 1/ 
2. Therefore, the use of high-power lamps is not productive, which can often be 
described in the literature. 
It is known that TiO2, ZnO and many other binary oxides and their modifications 
[14, 15] are photocatalytically active only in the UV range or close to it. The UV 
range corresponds to only about 5–9% of the solar light spectrum (100–400 nm), 
while the distribution of intensity between these wavelengths is not the same and the 
main part is 350–400 nm. Compounds that absorb light with a wavelength of less 
than 400 nm, work inefficiently under solar light and require a separate radiation 
source. In this regard, the search for new compounds, which show photocatalytic 
activity in the visible range, is relevant. 
6.2 Mechanism of Biocidal Action of Metal Oxide 
Microparticles 
6.2.1 Mechanism of Action in Dark Conditions 
Nano- and microparticles of metal oxides can have antimicrobial properties and 
damage to microorganisms by interacting with cellular walls or membranes and/ 
or by penetrating inside the cell and affecting cell components (organelles, DNA, 
proteins, enzymes, ATP, etc., Fig. 6.1).6 Antimicrobial Effect of Nano- and Sub-micron Particles of Metal … 193
Fig. 6.1 Mechanism of antifungal action of oxide particle on the cell of filamentous fungi 
Metal oxide particles can exhibit their toxicity as a result of electrostatic interac￾tion, caused by a mismatch of charge between them and the cell. The attraction that 
arises due to this charge difference leads to the accumulation of particles on the cell 
surface, and further their penetration into the cell membrane and structural damage 
to it. For example, it can lead to the rupture of the cell wall, increased permeability 
of the plasmalemma, leaks in the cytoplasm, and cell death. 
Using ZnO as an example, it was shown that particles are capable of interacting 
with membrane lipids and thiol (–SH) groups of proteins, which are also important 
for transmembrane and intracellular transport. Penetrating inside the bacterial cell, 
ZnO particles can inactivate DNA and their enzymes, inhibit the level of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP), and cause a decrease in the number of the bacterial 16S rDNA 
gene copies. Mitochondrial function is disrupted, lactate dehydrogenase leakage 
occurs, and cell morphology changes under the influence of particles. 
Particles deform the growth structure of the fungus, and noticeable thinning and 
thickening of hyphae fibers, liquefaction of cytoplasmic content, reduction of its 
electron density with the presence of vacuoles and significant detachment of the cell 
wall are observed (Figs. 6.2 and 6.3) [3].194 V. F. Smirnov et al.
Fig. 6.2 SEM photo of Botrytis cinerea: a and b control and c, and d after ZnO treatment [4]
6.2.2 Mechanism of Action under Light Irradiation 
(Antimicrobial Effect of Particles as a Result 
of Photocatalysis) 
The formation of active oxygen forms (AFO) by metal oxide particles under the light 
radiation is one of the ways they interact with microorganisms. 
The ZnO compound has high photocatalytic efficiency [3]. Under the UV action 
electrons in ZnO are excited from the valence edge to the conduction band, and elec￾tron–hole pairs (e–h+) appear. These pairs move to the oxide surface where oxida￾tion/reduction reactions occur with water and oxygen, leading to the AFO formation. 
Photogenerated holes (h+) split water molecules contained in the suspension with zinc 
oxide into hydroxyl radicals and protons. Electrons react with dissolved oxygen to 
form superoxide radical, which, interacting with H+, turns into hydroperoxyl radical. 
Then, hydrogen peroxide is formed from this radical in a reaction with a proton and 
an electron. 
Hydroxyl and superoxide radicals are unable to penetrate inside the cell, while 
the resulting H2O2 is capable of doing so. It was also found that superoxide anion6 Antimicrobial Effect of Nano- and Sub-micron Particles of Metal … 195
Fig. 6.3 SEM photo of Penicillium expansum: a and b control and c and d after ZnO treatment [4]
radicals and hydroxyl radicals formed interact with the cell wall, destroy the plasma 
membrane, thereby causing the loss of intracellular material, disruption of osmotic 
balance and cell homeostasis. 
It is known that AFOs at physiological concentrations play an important role in the 
metabolism of a living cell. It was shown that AFOs, generated by NADPH oxidases, 
function as signaling molecules and are necessary for many differentiation processes. 
AFOs are important for many aspects of fungal life, including vegetative growth of 
hyphae, differentiation of conidial anastomosis tubes, formation of fruiting bodies 
and infectious structures, as well as for the induction of apoptosis [16]. The key 
role in protecting living organisms from the damaging effects of AFOs is played by 
the antioxidant system, which includes enzymes involved in the AFOs metabolism 
(primarily, catalases, peroxidases and phenoloxidases) and low molecular weight 
compounds (for example, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, flavonoids, etc.), interacting 
with active radicals. The functioning of this system neutralizes the excess of AFOs 
and provides protection of the cell’s biological structures [17]. Peroxisomes and 
mitochondria are organelles where AFOs are actively produced. Also, a number of 
cytochrome-dependent oxygenases, producing superoxide radical, are localized in 
the smooth endoplasmic reticulum [18].196 V. F. Smirnov et al.
Excessive production of AFOs causes oxidative stress. It is known that at the 
initial stage of oxidative stress development, the enzymes of the fungus’s antioxidant 
defense can undergo inactivation (or degradation) by highly toxic oxygen radicals, 
primarily peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical. These radicals can form when super￾oxide interacts with nitric oxide, synthesized by mitochondrial NO synthase, and 
trivalent iron of ferritin and iron–sulfur complexes of electron transfer chains [17]. 
Also, the inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activity is facilitated by the action of 
cationic nanoparticles of metal oxides. An imbalance between the ROS production 
and their removal leads to oxidative damage to lipids in membranes. It is well known 
that unsaturated fatty acids of biomembranes are the main target of radical attack. 
They initiate a chain reaction of fatty acid radical formation, causing membrane 
damage through lipid peroxidation. 
The interaction of free radicals and the resulting products with proteins leads to 
their polymerization and loss of biological activity, disruption of permeability for H+, 
OH− and Ca2+ ions. For example, O2
− oxidizes SH− groups in protein compounds, 
causes depolymerization of glycosaminoglycans and acidic polysaccharides, inac￾tivates catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, and suppresses calcium ion transport. 
Acceleration of lipid peroxidation in membranes causes a depletion of the protein 
microenvironment with unsaturated lipids. 
The relative resistance of fungi to photocatalytic oxidation may be associated 
with the protective action of polysaccharides, and enzymes (catalase, superoxide 
dismutase and others) in the cell wall, and the low efficiency of these mechanisms 
relative to bacteria may be associated with the increased resistance of bacteria to 
broad-spectrum agents [3]. 
An analysis of various articles showed that most studies are devoted to studying 
the antimicrobial activity of metal oxides, which exhibit a photocatalytic effect in 
the UV range. And very few studies related to the regulation of antimicrobial activity 
in the visible spectrum. Such studies will significantly expand the possibilities for 
practical application of metal oxides with photocatalytic activity as antimicrobial 
agents. In this regard, complex metal oxides with a β-pyrochlore structure developed 
at the Institute of Chemistry of Lobachevsky State University are very promising:
• RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with an average particle diameter of 4658 nm (2) and 736 nm (3);
• CsTeMoO6 with an average particle diameter of 670 nm (4). 
For comparison, a similar study of tungsten oxide (WO3 (1) with an average 
particle size of 674 nm) was conducted. 
Previous studies of the electronic structure of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and CsTeMoO6 
[19–21] showed that the Rb and Cs-containing phases have additional absorption 
bands at ~2.51 eV and at ~2, 2.6 eV in the band gap, respectively, which corresponds 
to the visible light range. From the electron diagram for the compounds, it follows 
that when photons with an energy of ~2.51 eV for RbTe 1.5 W 0.5 O 6 and ~2 eV for 
CsTeMoO 6 are absorbed, formed electron–hole pairs can lead to the decomposition 
of organic substances, which was confirmed by the methylene blue photodegradation. 
Tungsten oxide (WO3) has a relatively small band gap (~2.8 eV) without any 
additional absorbance, which leads to the absorption of blue light (462 nm). It is6 Antimicrobial Effect of Nano- and Sub-micron Particles of Metal … 197
known that WO3 is capable of photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds under 
the action of visible light. 
The particle size distribution of powders was calculated according to the 
Fraunhofer theory (Fig. 6.4). 
From the figures, it can be seen that the maximum particle distribution for 
compound (2) is at 7 μm, and for compound (3)—at 470 nm. However, the distri￾bution for both samples is not unimodal. The powder sample of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
(2), dispersed in an agate mortar, possesses a significant contribution of particles 
with sizes in the range from tens of nanometers to several microns, leading to the 
determination of the average particle size of 4658 nm. Compound (3) was ground 
in a planetary mill, thus the presence of particles in the region up to 10 microns is 
observed, which are stable agglomerates, therefore the average particle size turns out 
to be larger than the maximum distribution—736 nm. The study of the morphology 
of the samples shows that long grinding leads to a decrease in the number of agglom￾erates and the general averaging of particles in size and shape. From the SEM data, 
it can be seen that WO3 is a finely dispersed powder and has an average particle size 
of 674 nm. The size particle distribution showed that in addition to the maximum,

c WO3 and d CsTeMoO6 198 V. F. Smirnov et al.
Fig. 6.5 Spectrum of lamp PFL-C3 
corresponding to 422 nm, there is a small maximum around 6 microns. It is probably 
due to the formation of quite stable agglomerates. 
The average particle size of the CsTeMoO6 powder, dispersed in a planetary mill, 
is 670 nm, while the maximum size particle distribution corresponds to 300 nm. 
The particle size distribution is unimodal, and SEM results show that the powder is 
predominantly represented by small agglomerates. 
Below, the authors of this monograph present their own experimental studies in 
terms of assessing the antimicrobial activity of these newly synthesized compounds. 
As a light source, they used LED lamp and moisture protected projectors JAZZWAY 
PFL-C3 with a power of 30 and 50 W. The surface density of the radiation flux from 
LED projectors, affecting the surface of the samples of chemical compounds, was 
325.5 W/m2 (for a 30 W source) and 524 W/m2 (for a 50 W source). These light 
sources have the same wave spectrum and differ only in intensity (Fig. 6.5). 
6.3 Antifungal Activity of Compounds with β-Pyrochlore 
Structure 
As test cultures of microscopic fungi, strains were used, obtained from the Russian 
collection of microorganisms (Institute of Biochemistry and Physiology of Microor￾ganisms by Scriabin of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino): Aspergillus 
niger van Tieghen № 1119, Penicillium chrysogenum Thom № F-245. These 
micromycetes are active biodestructors of various industrial materials.6 Antimicrobial Effect of Nano- and Sub-micron Particles of Metal … 199
To assess the light effect on the antifungal activity of compounds a suspension of 
fungal spores in sterile water was prepared. Compounds were added in 10 ml of spore 
suspension of fungi (with a titer of 104 CFU/ml) so that their final concentration was 2 
mg/ml. Experimental variants were subjected to light exposure (30 and 50 W) for 60, 
120 and 180 min. Other experiment variants were kept in dark conditions for the same 
time periods. Controls were variants with fungal spores without the compounds under 
study. All variants were placed on orbital shakers at 150 rpm. After that, the change 
in the titer of fungal cultures was determined by the cup method (Koch’s method) by 
sowing fungi on agarized medium of Czapek-Dox (NaNO3—2.0 g/l, KH2PO4—0.74 
g/l, K2HPO4—0.3 g/l, KCl—0.5 g/l, MgSO4·7H2O—0.5 g/l, FeSO4·7H2O—0.01 g/ 
l, agar–agar—20.0 g/l, sucrose—30.0 g/l) with subsequent counting of the number 
of grown fungi colonies. Petri dishes with fungal cultures were placed in a thermostat 
at 28 ± 2°C for 72 h. The antifungal action of the preparations was assessed by the 
degree of survival microorganisms, which was determined by the change in the titer 
of fungal culture spores. 
When studying the action of compounds on the vegetative mycelium, fungi were 
grown on liquid (without agar) nutrient medium of Czapek-Dox on shakers (150 
rpm) in Erlenmeyer flasks with a volume of 500 ml at a temperature of 27 ± 2 
°C for 7 days. The compounds with a concentration of 2 mg/ml were resuspended 
in a sterile nutrient medium with a volume of 10 ml in sterile beakers, then fungi 
mycelium (50–100 mg) was added. Fungal mycelium without the compounds was 
used as control. All variants were placed on orbital shakers at 150 rpm for 120 and 
240 min in dark conditions and under light irradiation (30 and 50 W). Then the 
mycelium (in all variants) from the beakers was transferred to 100 ml Erlenmeyer 
flasks in liquid medium of Czapek-Dox and cultivated for another 7 days under the 
same conditions. After the cultivation period, the inhibitory action was determined 
by the growth of the mycelium biomass. 
All experimental results were processed using the non-parametric U (Mann– 
Whitney) criterion with Holm’s correction. The results were obtained in three inde￾pendent experiments. Each variant in the experiment was represented in five repeti￾tions. From each repetition, three microbiological samples were taken for analysis. 
Thus, the number of independent experimental repetitions for each variant of the 
experiment was 15. 
As the authors have previously noted, binary and complex oxides find wide 
application in medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture, including as means 
of protecting industrial materials from bio-damage. It is known that the main agents 
of bio-damage to industrial materials are mycelial fungi [22]. Therefore, it was of 
interest to investigate various oxides, which exhibit antimicrobial activity due to 
photocatalytic properties under visible light irradiation. The results of our research 
are presented in Figs. 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15.
Figure 6.6 shows the effect of WO3 on the survival of the fungi spores of Peni￾cillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus niger under conditions of darkness and light 
exposure (30 W). 
The duration of exposures under light and dark conditions without the compounds 
did not affect the survival of fungal spores, so the survival of fungal spores in the200 V. F. Smirnov et al.

absence of the compounds was used as a control. The results show that there was a 
decrease in the survival of spores of the fungi A. niger and P. chrysogenum under 
the WO3 action both with irradiation (30 W lamp) and in darkness. The action of 
light enhanced the antifungal effect with respect to A. niger in all variants of the 
experiment, and with respect to P. chrysogenum only under conditions of exposure 
for 180 min. 
Figure 6.7 shows the effect of the compound RbTe1.5W0.5O6 on the fungi spores 
under irradiation (30 W lamp).6 Antimicrobial Effect of Nano- and Sub-micron Particles of Metal … 201

Fig. 6.9 Fungal spores survival ratio reduction of P. chrysogenum i A. niger in RbTe1.5W0.5O6 
presence under dark and light (50 W) conditions
Here, as in the case of the WO3 compound, a decrease in spore survival was 
observed both under light and in conditions of darkness. The inhibitory effect of 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with respect to P. chrysogenum is observed already at 60 min expo￾sure, unlike WO3. In the case of A. niger under the action of 30 W lamp the spores 
survival was lower than in conditions of darkness for both WO3 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6. 
Note that RbTe1.5W0.5O6 in conditions of darkness had a more pronounced antifungal 
effect with respect to A. niger compared to WO3.202 V. F. Smirnov et al.

dark and light (30 W) conditions
The antimicrobial activity of nano- and submicron particles of oxides can vary 
depending on the light source power, so experiments were also conducted with source 
of 50 W (Figs. 6.8 and 6.9). 
As in the previous experiments, in the presence of the WO3 compound, there 
was a decrease in the survival of the fungi spores of P. chrysogenum and A. niger, 
and the light irradiation enhanced the observed effect. It was especially noticeable 
with respect to the fungus A. niger at 120 min and 180 min exposures. The inhibitory 
effect of WO3 under the light source with 50 W on the spores survival of A. niger was6 Antimicrobial Effect of Nano- and Sub-micron Particles of Metal … 203

higher than under 30 W lamp. Note that a more significant change in the survival of 
A. niger spores was detected. It was observed in the case of the light source’s impact 
on WO3 compared to RbTe1.5W0.5O 6 (Fig. 6.9). 
The RbTe1.5W0.5O6 compound had a more pronounced antifungal effect against 
the spores of the fungus P. chrysogenum compared to WO3. The greatest effect was 
observed at an exposure of 180 min. 
Many antifungal drugs show varying biocidal effects on spores and vegetative 
fungi mycelium. In this regard, the authors conducted experiments to evaluate204 V. F. Smirnov et al.

Fig. 6.15 Inhibitory effect of CsTeMoO6 on biomass yield P. chrysogenum and A. niger under 
dark and light (50 W) conditions
the WO3 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 action on the exogenous mycelium of A. niger and 
P. chrysogenum both under light irradiation and in dark conditions (Figs. 6.10, 6.11, 
6.12, and 6.13). The antifungal action of the compounds was evaluated by the changes 
in biomass growth. These experiments were also conducted with light sources of 30 
and 50 W with a flux density of 325.5 and 524 W/m2, respectively. 
The duration of exposure in light and dark conditions without the compounds 
did not affect the growth of fungal biomass, so the graphs used the growth of 
fungal biomass in the absence of the studied compounds as a control. The WO36 Antimicrobial Effect of Nano- and Sub-micron Particles of Metal … 205
and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 compounds reduced the biomass growth of fungi A. niger and 
P. chrysogenum both under light exposure and in dark conditions compared to the 
control, indicating their antifungal activity. 
The effect of 30 W light on WO3 increased its antifungal activity at an exposure 
of 120 min against P. chrysogenum, and against A. niger—at exposures of 120 and 
240 min compared to the dark experiment variants (Fig. 6.10). 
At the same time, the antifungal activity of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 under the 30 W lamp 
changed more significantly against P. chrysogenum at 240 min exposure, and against 
A. niger—at an exposure of 120 min (Fig. 6.11). 
When studying the WO3 action on P. chrysogenum using a 50 W light source, no 
prevailing antifungal activity was observed compared to darkness. On the contrary, 
the growth of A. niger biomass under these lighting conditions significantly decreased 
at an exposure of 240 min (Fig. 6.12). 
When using a 50 W light source, there was an increase in the antifungal activity 
of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 compared to the dark experiment variant. This effect is more 
pronounced for the fungus P. chrysogenum, than for A. niger. 
We also investigated the antifungal action of another complex oxide—CsTeMoO6. 
The results of these studies are presented in Figs. 6.14 and 6.15. 
In the case of the CsTeMoO6 action on fungal spores, suppression of their activity 
was observed both in dark conditions and under light irradiation. The antimicrobial 
effect under light exposure was enhanced, which, apparently, is associated with the 
photocatalytic activity (Fig. 6.15). 
In the case of experiments with vegetative mycelium (Fig. 6.17), a decrease in the 
growth of fungal biomass was observed under the action of the compound in the dark 
and in the light. The fungicidal effect of CsTeMoO6 increased under light exposure 
compared to the dark experiment variants. It should be noted that in the case of A. 
niger with an increase in exposure time, the inhibitory effect both in the dark and in the 
light also increased. In the variants with P. chrysogenum the inhibitory effect on the 
survival of vegetative cells decreased under the light influence as the exposure time 
increased. Thus, it can be said that the effect of exposure duration on antimicrobial 
activity was ambiguous. Studying the compound action on vegetative mycelium of 
A. niger, there was an increase in the biocidal effect with an increase in exposure 
time, while in the case of fungal spores and mycelial cells of P. chrysogenum, there 
was a decrease or absence of statistically significant changes. 
Comparison of the action of the CsTeMoO6 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 compounds on 
the survival of the same microorganisms shows that the latter has a stronger antimi￾crobial effect. The suppression degree of the activity of individual cultures by these 
compounds is also different, which confirms the dependence of the antimicrobial 
effect on the nature of the metals in these compounds.206 V. F. Smirnov et al.
6.4 Antibacterial Activity of Compounds with β-Pyrochlore 
Structure 
As already noted by the authors, the leading role in the emergence of the process of 
biodeterioration belongs to mycelial fungi. However, certain industrial materials can 
also be affected by bacteria. It is known that the bacterial damage accounts for 20% 
of all types of biodeterioration. 
As bacteria test cultures, strains of E. coli ATCC 25922 (Gram-negative) and S. 
aureus ATCC 6538 P (Gram-positive) (American Type Culture Collection, USA) 
were used. These strains are used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of various 
chemical compounds. For experiments, 24-h cultures of bacteria were used, which 
were resuspended in sterile water. The initial titer of the cultures was 1 × 106 cells/ml. 
The test substances were introduced into the experimental variants at a concentration 
of 2 mg/ml. The exposure (action time of the compounds on bacteria) was 30 and 120 
min. Some samples were exposed to light sources (30 and 50 W), and other variants 
remained in the dark. Both types of variants were placed on shakers (150 rpm). As 
a control, variants with bacterial cultures were used under the action of light and 
darkness, but without the presence of the studied compounds. After this, the change 
in the titer of bacterial cultures was determined by the cup method (Koch’s principle) 
by sowing bacteria on an agarized medium with subsequent counting of the grown 
colonies number. Petri dishes with bacterial cultures were placed in a thermostat at 
37°C for 24 h. The antimicrobial action of the preparations was evaluated by the 
degree of microorganisms survival, which was calculated based on the change in the 
titer of bacterial cultures [22]. The results are presented in Figs. 6.16, 6.17, 6.18, and 
6.19. 
The action of 30 and 50 W light enhanced the WO3 activity against both cultures 
of bacteria. For E. coli, survival decreased at exposures of 30 and 120 min, and for S. 
aureus—120 min. It was noted that the use of a 30 W light source to a greater extent

Fig. 6.18 Bacteria survival ratio reduction in RbTe1.5W0.5O6 (736 nm) presence under dark and 
light (30 and 50 W) conditions
reduced the survival of bacteria test cultures (compared to 50 W), which indicates a 
greater antimicrobial activity in this variant of the experiment. 
When studying WO3, a stronger suppression of culture survival occurs for S. 
aureus. The light action enhanced the inhibitory effect of this compound, especially at 
an exposure of 120 min (survival was 1–5%). Thus, the bactericidal activity presence 
of this compound has been detected (Fig. 6.18), while in other cases the survival of 
the studied bacteria cultures in the presence of WO3 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 can be 
considered as a bacteriostatic action. As in the experiments with WO3, the influence 
of a 30 W light source was noted compared to a 50 W source. 
The particle size has significant importance for the antimicrobial activity of oxides 
(both in the dark and under the light). In this regard the antimicrobial activity of208 V. F. Smirnov et al.
Fig. 6.19 Bacteria survival ratio reduction in CsTeMoO6 presence under dark and light (50 W) 
conditions
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with particle sizes of 4658 nm and 736 nm compounds was compared. 
The results are presented in Fig. 6.19. It was found that the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 compound 
with a particle size of 736 nm exhibits a stronger antimicrobial effect on the bacteria 
test cultures both in the dark and under the light compared to the compound with a 
larger particle size. Moreover, the light irradiation significantly enhanced this effect 
for RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a particle size of 736 nm compared to RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with 
a particle size of 4658 nm. It was also observed that with an increase in exposure 
time, the antimicrobial effect of these compounds in the dark and light conditions 
increased. It was found that RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a particle size of 736 nm causes 
a stronger reduction in the survival of E. coli compared to S. aureus. The survival 
of E. coli was 1.0–2.0% in the dark and 0.1–1.0% in the light. It indicates that 
this complex oxide exhibits bactericidal activity, which is enhanced under the light 
influence. While the bactericidal effect of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a larger particle size 
for S. aureus is only manifested at 120 min of exposure, and this compound does 
not have a bactericidal effect on E. coli. It was found out that the compound with a 
smaller particle size had the opposite effect compared to bacteria in the presence of 
a compound with a larger particle size under the light sources with different power 
(30 and 50 W). In this case, RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a particle size of 736 nm using a 
30 W light source caused a strong reduction in the survival of S. aureus, while the 
action of the same source (30 W) in the presence of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a particle 
size of 4658 nm resulted in a greater reduction in E. coli survival. 
Next, we investigated the antibacterial activity of the CsTeMoO6 complex oxide 
on the survival of bacteria E. coli and S. aureus in the dark and under the light. The 
results are presented in Fig. 6.19.6 Antimicrobial Effect of Nano- and Sub-micron Particles of Metal … 209
It was found that the compound is capable of inhibiting the life activity of these 
microorganisms both in the dark and under the light. A more pronounced antimicro￾bial effect was observed for E. coli. The light action led to a decrease in the bacteria 
survival compared to the experimental variants with introduced CsTeMoO6, which 
were kept in the dark. 
6.5 Effect of Different Factors on the Antimicrobial 
Activity of Metal Oxides 
As we have already noted above, the antimicrobial activity of oxides, which have 
photocatalytic activity, depends on many factors, such as particle size and shape, 
their concentration, illumination, band gap, exposure time, nature of the metals, 
type of bioagent, and others. Based on the experimental data presented in Figs. 6.6, 
6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, 6.17, 6.18, and 6.19, certain 
generalizations can be made. In our experiments, when comparing the antimicrobial 
activity of the compound RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with particle sizes of 4658 nm and 736 nm, 
it was found that the particle size has a significant effect on the test culture survival 
of bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus both in the dark and under 
the light. It was noted that the bactericidal effect on microorganisms becomes more 
noticeable for the compound RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a particle size of 736 nm compared 
to the compound RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a particle size of 4658 nm. 
Comparing the light effect on the WO3 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 compounds with a 
particle size of 736 nm, it can be noted that the compound RbTe1.5W0.5O6 under 
light source 30 W and 50 W with a radiation flux density of 325.5 and 524 W/m2, 
respectively, showed stronger antimicrobial activity against the spores and vegetative 
mycelium of the studied fungi P. chrysogenum and A. niger compared to WO3. The 
ambiguous effect of different light sources (30 and 50 W) on the antimicrobial activity 
of RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a particle size of 736 nm compared to RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a 
particle size of 4658 nm was noted. 
It was found that the light action significantly enhanced the antibacterial effect 
against E. coli and S. aureus of the RbTe1.5W0.5O6 compound with a particle size 
of 736 nm compared to the compound RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a particle size of 4658 
nm. In experiments with RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with a particle size of 736 nm and WO3,a 
stronger influence of a 30 W light source was noted compared to a 50 W source. 
The nature of the metal also affects the antimicrobial activity of the oxides. In the 
study of RbTe1.5W0.5O6, a stronger antimicrobial effect was also found against E. 
coli and S. aureus compared to WO3. 
Comparing the action of the CsTeMoO6 and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 compounds on the 
survival of the same studied microorganisms, it can be noted that the latter has a 
stronger antimicrobial effect. The suppression degree of the activity of individual 
cultures by these compounds is also different, which confirms the validity of the210 V. F. Smirnov et al.
statement about the dependence of the antimicrobial effect on the metals nature in 
these compounds. 
In the study of the compound RbTe1.5W0.5O6, a stronger antimicrobial effect was 
found against E. coli and S. aureus compared to WO3, which was manifested in all 
exposure variants. 
It was found that the complex oxide CsTeMoO6 is capable of exhibiting an antimi￾crobial effect both in the dark and under light conditions against the bacteria E. coli 
and S. aureus, as well as against the spores and vegetative mycelium of the fungi P. 
chrysogenum and A. niger. The greatest inhibitory action of submicron particles of 
this compound was noted for E. coli. 
The WO3 compound in the dark to the greatest extent reduced the viability of 
spores P. chrysogenum, and the compound RbTe1.5W0.5O6—the survival of spores 
A. niger. Also, RbTe1.5W0.5O6 significantly inhibited the growth of the vegetative 
mycelium of these fungi compared to WO3. 
The difference in the survival rate of microorganisms under the influence of 
CsTeMoO6, WO3, and RbTe1.5W0.5O6 both in dark conditions and under the light 
may be associated with the presence of physiological and biochemical features in the 
studied cultures, namely, possibly different resistance mechanisms to this complex 
oxide. 
It was noted that the light action enhanced the inhibitory effect of both 
RbTe1.5W0.5O6 and WO3, especially with an exposure of 120 min (the survival rate 
of E. coli and S. aureus was 1–5%), in this case, we can talk about the bactericidal 
activity of these compounds, while in other cases the survival of the studied bacterial 
cultures in the presence of these compounds can be considered as a bacteriostatic 
effect. 
The duration of exposure had an ambiguous effect on the CsTeMoO6 antimicrobial 
effect. In some cases, with an increase in the exposure time of this compound under 
light and dark conditions, there was a decrease in the survival of microorganisms 
(test cultures of fungi and bacteria), while in others it remained unchanged or even 
increased. 
It was observed that with an increase in exposure time, the antimicrobial effect on 
E. coli and S. aureus of the compounds RbTe1.5W0.5O6 with different particle size 
increased.

Methods for Preparation of Pyrochlore 
Oxides and Their Effect 
on the Photocatalytic Activity 
A. S. Belousov 
For the future commercialization of pyrochlore oxides, it is crucial to simplify their 
preparation method to make them cost-efficient and “green” with maintaining high 
photocatalytic performances. Several preparation methods for pyrochlore fabrica￾tion have been developed. Table 7.1 highlights the main preparation techniques for 
pyrochlore oxides with their advantages and disadvantages.
Special attention in the theory and practice of preparing highly active heteroge￾neous photocatalysts, including complex oxides with pyrochlore structure, should 
be paid to obtain small-sized and hierarchically porous materials. Downsizing 
pyrochlore oxides to the nanoscale with desired morphologies and functional prop￾erties (high specific surface area and more accessible available sites) can become 
promising approaches to obtain active photocatalysts. Moreover, a well-designed 
structure allows the separation of photogenerated charges to be achieved. 
7.1 Solid-State Reaction (SSR) 
Solid-state reactions (SSRs) are simple and widely used synthetic methods for fabri￾cating inorganic solid materials [12]. The solid-state reaction route involves chemical 
decomposition reactions, in which a mixture of solid materials is heated to obtain 
a new solid. This method is commonly used for the production of complex oxides, 
such as perovskite [13–15], pyrochlore [16, 17], and spinel [18, 19], from simple 
oxides, carbonates, nitrates, hydroxides, oxalates, alkoxides, and other metal salts. 
The technique includes several annealing steps followed by milling steps to increase 
the homogeneity of the mixture and decrease the particle size of the obtained powder.

The solid-state route is relatively inexpensive, solvent-free, requires simple appa￾ratus, and produces materials with high purity. Moreover, large volumes of the desired 
material can be prepared in one-step procedure. However, compared to the wet 
powder preparation routes (sol–gel, hydrothermal, etc.), the obtained powder shows 
relatively high agglomeration, and, therefore, relatively large particle sizes. 
As mentioned above, mechanochemical treatment like ball milling is a major route 
to improve the surface properties of materials prepared by the solid-state synthesis. 
Mechanochemical synthesis by ball-milling technology is gaining attention because 
of its low-cost, eco-friendly nature and possibility to significantly increase surface 
area [20–22]. In this case, the effect of milling time, milling intensity, milling atmo￾sphere, the introduction of reducing agents on the particle size, surface area and the 
crystal structure of the products should be taken into account. 
For instance, ball milling of niobium tellurium oxides ANbTeO6 (A = Rb, Cs) 
with β-pyrochlore structure prepared via a solid-state reaction was significantly 
improved the photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MB [2]. It was shown that 
the bulk pyrochlores consist of highly agglomerated particles (Fig. 7.1a, b), while 
their grinding allowed the spherical nanosized particles to be obtained (70–150 nm 
according to SEM, Fig. 7.1c, d).
Similar observations were detected using the ball milling technique for other mate￾rials [23–25]. Abdolhoseinzadeh and Sheibani [23] prepared a ball-milled Cu2O– 
ZnO nano-photocatalyst with good performance under visible light irradiation. They 
found that ball milling of Cu2O and the presence of ZnO improves electron transfer7 Methods for Preparation of Pyrochlore Oxides and Their Effect … 215

before and after milling, respectively [2]
and suppresses the electron–hole recombination rate. As a result, ball-milled Cu2O– 
ZnO heterostructures showed higher photocatalytic activity among the prepared 
materials. Ye et al. [24] obtained CdS/TiO2 composite photocatalysts by the method 
of secondary ball milling at different ball milling speeds, milling time, and material 
ratios. The following conclusions were made from the experimental results: 
(1) The mechanochemical treatment can promote the dispersion of CdS on the 
surface of TiO2, forming an effective composite nanostructure with extended 
light absorption and narrow band gap, resulting in a significant improvement of 
the photodegradation efficiency. 
(2) The material ratio has an obvious influence on the photocatalytic degrada￾tion efficiency. When the ball milling speed, time, and material ratio were 
400 rpm, 10 h and 25:75, respectively, the CdS/TiO2 heterojunctions had better 
photocatalytic performances. 
However, one of the main limitations of ball milling is the possible contaminations 
during milling process. Thus, the control over ball milling process is important as 
several factors affect the end product. Another serious issue of combining solid-state 
reaction with ball milling is the long duration of the procedure to obtain nanoscale 
complex oxides with improved photocatalytic properties. Often, the SSR proceeds216 A. S. Belousov
within 20–24 h, while ball milling of materials requires about 10–20 h. For industrial 
prospects, it is necessary to choose a method that makes it possible to obtain nano￾sized materials with less time and energy. For the preparation of highly photoactive 
pyrochlores, it can be attractive to employ the sol–gel (SG) and hydrothermal (HT) 
methods instead of the conventional SSR. The SG and HT routes allow nanoma￾terials with smaller primary particle sizes and improved specific surface area to be 
obtained. The wet chemical routes have a major advantage over SSR, since they lead 
to drastic reduction in diffusion path lengths and, therefore, the reaction completes 
in much shorter time and requires less thermal energy [26]. 
7.2 Sol–Gel (SG) Method 
Sol–gel method is one of the well-established and simplest synthetic approaches 
to prepare high-quality nano- and microstructures [27, 28]. The SG route provides 
several advantages, such as control over the texture, size and surface properties of 
the materials, easy to implement, low cost, high quality, and production of materials 
with large surface area [29]. In general, the SG method can be described in five 
key steps [27, 30], including hydrolysis, condensation, aging, drying, and thermal 
decomposition (calcination) as described in Fig. 7.2. 
The first step includes hydrolysis of the precursors, such as metal alkoxides, 
in water or alcohols into a colloidal solution (sol). The polycondensation step is 
associated to the formation of a rigid and highly interconnected three-dimensional 
(3D) network (gel) comprising discrete particles or polymer chains due to the addition 
of a catalyst [30, 31]. These processes are affected by the number of experimental 
parameters, such as alkoxy functional group steric hindrance, temperature, pH of the 
solution, reactants concentration, the use of aqueous or non-aqueous media or organic 
solvents like alcohols and the use and concentration of catalysts (acid or base). During 
the aging step, polycondensation continues within the localized solution along with
Fig. 7.2 Schematic representation of step-by-step SG method [27] 7 Methods for Preparation of Pyrochlore Oxides and Their Effect … 217
precipitation of the gel network. Another important factor is the physical treatment 
of the sol or gel. If the structure is maintained, an aerogel is formed. On the contrary, 
if the structure collapses, a xerogel is formed. Cryogel is obtained if the liquid is 
removed at low temperatures. The aerogel provides high pore volume and surface 
area, while xerogel results in low surface area and pore volume. Heat treatment is also 
important for drying gels as well as removing surface hydroxyl groups [28, 29]. Thus, 
the SG route renders the possibility to control the physicochemical properties of the 
desired material by varying the synthesis parameters affecting the various preparation 
steps [32]. It should be noted that the Pechini method (Table 7.2), a process related 
to the SG route, offers an excellent control over complex oxide structure producing 
homogeneous solutions. 
The SG method has been widely utilized for the preparation of pyrochlore oxides 
[10, 33–36] as well as composites based on pyrochlores [37, 38]. Zhang and co￾workers [33] demonstrated that the use of PEG4000 as a template in the synthesis of 
porous Sm2Ti2O7 α-pyrochlore via the Pechini method is beneficial to the production 
of hydroxyl radicals under UV light irradiation. The optimum photocatalytic activity 
and the largest discoloration efficiency were for the sample using 1.5 g PEG4000. 
Similar patterns were detected using PEG1000 for the preparation of Gd2Ti2O7 
samples [35]. 
Ting et al. [36] investigated the effect of annealing temperatures on the phase 
development, layer morphology, and related optoelectronic properties of Y2Ti2O7 
pyrochlore thin layers. The authors found that Y2Ti2O7 thin layers have high average 
transmittance (73.8–75.1%), refractive index (1.931–1.954 at λ = 550 nm), and band 
gap energy (4.319–4.356 eV), which depends on the annealing temperature (400– 
750 °C). The optical band gap energy decreased from 4.356 to 4.319 eV when the 
Y2Ti2O7 thin layers annealing temperature increases from 400 to 700 °C, which 
could be associated with defects in the structure. In the Y2Ti2O7 lattice, enormous 
oxygen vacancies can exist because the large unit cell of Y2Ti2O7 allows some of 
the oxygen ions to move relatively freely [39]. After higher annealing temperature, 
the crystallization of amorphous Y2Ti2O7 was improved with the annihilation of 
oxygen vacancies, which is associated with the reduction in free charge carriers and 
the decrease in the optical band gap energy (Burstein–Moss (B–M) effect, Fig. 7.3).
It was recently shown that the use of the Pechini method is more preferable 
compared to co-precipitation to obtain highly active Bi2Ti2O7 pyrochlore photocat￾alyst (Fig. 7.4a) [11]. The higher activity of the pyrochlore nanopowder prepared by 
the Pechini method was attributed to the following factors:

Fig. 7.4 a Structure of Bi2Ti2O7; b degradation of MB photocatalyzed by the Bi2Ti2O7 pyrochlore 
nanopowders synthesized via Pechini (P) and co-precipitation (C) methods [11] 
(1) Distortion in lattice. The valence band of Bi2Ti2O7 constitutes a hybrid formed 
by the Bi 6s and O 2p orbitals, whereas the conduction band is predominantly 
constructed by Ti 3d orbitals. Overlapping of Bi 6s and O 2p takes place due to 
distortion in the crystal structure. The higher distortion in the crystal structure 
of the sample obtained via Pechini method, which was confirmed by XRD, 
Rietveld refinement, and Raman results, leads to a higher overlap of Bi 6s and 
O 2p orbitals, enhancing the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and 
leading to an increase in the photocatalytic activity. 
(2) Morphology of nanopowders. The average diameter of nanopowders in the 
sample prepared by Pechini method (47.17 nm) is observed small as compared 
to the sample obtained via co-precipitation route (70.36 nm). Though the sample 
obtained by Pechini method shows higher agglomerations, but due to higher7 Methods for Preparation of Pyrochlore Oxides and Their Effect … 219
porosity (confirmed by BET analysis), the specific surface area and, accordingly, 
the amount of active surface sites increase. The smaller particle size leads to a 
decrease in the electron–hole pairs recombination rate. 
Despite the obvious advantages of the SG route (easy to regulate physicochemical 
properties, nanometric particles, etc.), there are several limitations that should be 
addressed to optimize its efficiency and reproducibility [40]: 
(1) Achieving optimal dispersion and stability of nanoparticles in the liquid 
medium. Nanoparticles tend to agglomerate and settle due to their high surface 
energy and Van der Waals forces, which could lead to poor reproducibility. 
(2) The cost of the precursors may be high. For instance, MgO powder with a 
purity of 98% is available in small quantities for $30/kg. Magnesium ethoxide, 
a chemical source for making MgO by the SG method, costs about $200/kg. 
(3) There is often a large volume shrinkage and cracking during drying and 
removing the toxic organics. 
7.3 Hydrothermal (HT) Method 
The HT method is the most popular, powerful, and effective approach to fabricate 
nanomaterials with different morphologies, including hierarchical structures [41, 
42]. The term “hydrothermal” was first used by the British geologist Sir Roderick 
Murchison, where “hydro” meaning water and “thermal” meaning heat [41]. The 
hydrothermal synthesis is comparatively an ease and usually one-step involved 
process, cost-effective, eco-friendly, and tunable [43]. In this route, crystal growth of 
materials is carried out in highly corrosive reagents at high temperature and pressure. 
The process should be performed in a Teflon autoclave within a stainless-steel 
vessel (Fig. 7.5a) and kept in furnace at a temperature above 100 °C, which is more 
than the boiling point of water and pressure greater than 1 atm [44]. The phases 
of water at different temperatures and pressures are shown in Fig. 7.5b, where a 
critical point is a point above which fluid is converted into supercritical on condi￾tion of the critical temperature (TC) and critical pressure (PC). The characteristics 
of supercritical fluid are dependent on the temperature and pressure. When the crit￾ical temperature and critical pressure are reached, densities of both phases become 
equivalent. At supercritical pressure and temperature, solvent physical properties, 
such as dielectric constant and solubility, significantly change [41].
Regulating the reaction parameters, such as reaction time, temperature, reaction 
medium, pressure, pH, concentration of the reactants, and filled volume of auto￾clave, the nanomaterial properties like morphology, size, and structure may be easily 
tailored. This method is suitable for the preparation of nanomaterials, nanostructures, 
and nanocomposites of metal, alloys, ceramic, organic, and polymers with various 
morphologies [45]. To achieve simultaneous control over the crystalline phase, sizes, 
morphologies, and surface functional groups during the HT reaction, surfactants, 
such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) [46, 47], sodium dodecyl sulfate220 A. S. Belousov
Fig. 7.5 a Teflon autoclave within a stainless-steel vessel for the HT synthesis of materials; 
b graphical representations of different phases of water [41]
(SDS) [48, 49], polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) [50], etc., are often used. Solvothermal 
(ST) synthesis is very close in methodology to the HT method [51, 52], but the ST 
method requires the use of solvents (usually toxic) that makes it non-environment 
friendly and costly. 
Zeng and co-workers [53] found that the HT synthesis parameters, including alka￾line concentration, reaction time, and reaction temperature play a crucial role in the 
formation of La2Sn2O7 pyrochlore. For instance, the effect of reaction temperature 
on the morphology evolution of La2Sn2O7 is shown in Fig. 7.6. As can be seen from 
Fig. 7.6a, the morphology of the sample prepared at 120 °C is basically irregular. An 
increase in the reaction temperature to 160 °C resulted in the rod-like morphology 
among the irregular colloid (Fig. 7.6b). The La2Sn2O7 nanocubes were attained at 
180 °C for 12 h (Fig. 7.6c). At 200 °C for 12 h, well square-shaped products formed 
(Fig. 7.6d).
A similar picture is observed when changing the synthesis parameters of other 
complex oxides, e.g., Bi2WO6 with the perovskite structure [54, 55]. As can be seen 
from Fig. 7.7 [54], the sheet-like morphology is characteristic of all the samples 
prepared at 150–200 °C, while a homogenous sheet-like morphology formed only 
at 200 °C and 12–24 h, consisting of 10–20 nm thick and 200–400 nm wide angular 
forms. The morphology changes by decreasing the reaction time to 6 h with the 
appearance of curved discs and fibers. The pH value during the HT synthesis of 
Bi2WO6 (Fig. 7.7) also has great importance on the morphology (flakes, sheets, 
spherical figures, rods, flower, cubic and octahedral shapes or nest-like architec￾tures, etc.) and photocatalytic properties. It was found that an increase in the amount 
of acetic acid and, accordingly, a decrease in the pH results in the change of the 
Bi2WO6 morphology according to the following order: clew-like, clew-like and 
flower-like, flower-like, dish-like with crisscross, dish-like with incomplete criss￾cross and dish-like [56]. The experiment results showed that the hierarchical clew￾like sample with the largest specific surface area is characterized by the highest 
activity in the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.7 Methods for Preparation of Pyrochlore Oxides and Their Effect … 221

Wu et al. [57] demonstrated that a 3D flower-like hierarchical pyrochlore oxide 
Bi2Sn2O7, composed of 2D Bi2Sn2O7 nanosheets, exhibited higher activity compared 
to Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles in the degradation of TC. The unique structure of a hier￾archical sample (Fig. 7.8) had a larger interface, availability of tunnels, and more 
active sites [58], all of which helped in reducing the flow resistance and promoting 
the contact between the material and antibiotic. Also, large amounts of textural trans￾port pathways, which facilitate reactant molecules moving and getting to the reactive 
sites, are beneficial to various chemical reactions [59].
Thus, the HT method presents a feasible synthesis route to produce pyrochlore￾based photocatalysts with controllable surface and photocatalytic properties. 
Compared to other synthesis methods, it is easier to synthesize nanoscale mate￾rials using the HT route. The synthesized nanomaterials are uniformly distributed in222 A. S. Belousov

form and size and have larger specific surface area [60]. However, the disadvantages 
of this method include the high capital requirement for reactor due to harsh reaction 
conditions and the inability to monitor crystal growth. These limitations should be 
considered and taken into account before the possible practical application of the 
method.
