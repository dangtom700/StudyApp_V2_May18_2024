This book arises from the lecture notes of the course “Elements of Theoretical 
Physics,” part of the “Materials Science” degree at the University of Rome Tor 
Vergata, which I taught between the years 2017 and 2023. They contain an intro￾duction to quantum mechanics, surgically tailored to provide students with essential 
concepts and tools for subsequent courses without sacrificing the completeness of the 
treatment. At the end of each chapter, the reader can find a series of solved exercises 
and other exercises, useful both for absorbing theoretical concepts and for applying 
the mathematical tools explained. 
Understanding the content of this book, and more generally, quantum mechanics, 
requires some familiarity with certain mathematical concepts assimilated in previous 
courses. For accuracy, knowledge of
• limits, derivatives and integrals;
• Taylor series;
• vector spaces, linear operators and Dirac notation;
• hermitian and unitary operators, eigenvectors and eigenkets;
• function of operators—spectral representation. 
I would like to first thank Prof. Enrico Perfetto, with whom I have had several 
discussions, for conducting the exercises of the course and proposing some of the 
exercises included in this book. I also thank the students who have followed over the 
years for stimulating me to refine the presentation of various topics year after year.

The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum 
Mechanics 
1.1 The Need to Abandon Classical Physics 
To understand the problems of classical physics in describing the microscopic world, 
let’s start with a concrete example. Let’s consider the hydrogen molecule ion, H. 
+
2 . 
This ion consists of two protons, located at a distance of about .10−10 m, and one 
electron. The mass of the protons is.mp = 1.67 × 10−27 Kg, which is approximately 
1800 times greater than the mass of the electron, .me = 9.11 × 10−31 Kg. We can 
then treat the two protons as fixed in their equilibrium positions, denoted by . R1
and .R2, while the electron is free to move around them. The electron is, of course, 
attracted to the protons due to the Coulomb force, and if the electron is at position 
. r, its potential energy is 
.V(r) = − e2
|r − R1|
− e2
|r − R2| (1.1) 
with .e = 1.6 × 10−19C being the magnitude of the electric charge. Choosing the 
coordinate origin equidistant from both protons, the potential energy of Eq. (1.1) is 
illustrated in Fig. 1.1 and takes the form of a double well. 
Classically, if the electron is located at. r and has momentum. p, its energy. E is the 
sum of the kinetic and potential energies, namely.E = p2
2m + V(r). Thus, the lowest 
energy state corresponds to an electron with zero momentum (minimizing the kinetic 
energy.
p2
2m ) positioned at the center of either the first or second well (minimizing the 
potential energy). This is the classical prediction. However, to verify the correctness 
of this prediction, we must perform the experiment and measure the position and 
momentum of the electron. 
In the experiment, we first bring a gas of H. 
+
2 molecules into contact with a source 
at absolute zero temperature to minimize the energy of each molecule. We then 
proceed to measure the position . r and energy .E of the electron in each molecule

12 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
Fig. 1.1 Profile of the 
potential energy of an 
electron immersed in the 
electric field generated by 
two protons placed at 
.R1 and. R2
(from which we can extract the momentum as .p = √2m[E − V(r)]). As we see, 
the result of the experiment does not confirm the classical prediction. It is going to 
be a real puzzle, but we will find a way out. 
Let’s start by measuring the position of the electron for a large number of 
molecules. Clearly, it is not be possible to measure the position with infinite pre￾cision, but we can determine whether the electron is located in a small vicinity of 
.R1 or .R2. In fact, this is precisely what experimentally happens; the electron is 
always found in the vicinity of one of the two wells, in accordance with classical 
physics. Immediately after measuring the position, we proceed to measure the energy, 
molecule by molecule, once again. And here is where the puzzle begins. Regardless 
of the just-measured position, the energy always turns out to be higher than the mini￾mum predicted by classical physics. Even more surprisingly, although all molecules 
are in the same condition, for some of them, the measured energy is a certain value 
.Ea, while for others, it is a different value .Eb /= Ea. The probability of measuring 
.Ea is roughly the same as measuring.Eb, and both are slightly less than 0.5: 
.P(Ea) P(Eb) 0.5 (1.2) 
All other measured energy values are larger than both.Ea and.Eb and are neglected 
here since the probability of measuring them is extremely small. There are facts; 
nature indeed behave this way, take it or leave it. If we take it then fundamental 
questions inevitably arise: 
Why is the measured energy always greater than the minimum predicted by clas￾sical physics? And why is it not always the same? How do we know whether we will 
measure .Ea or .Eb? From these data, it seems impossible to simultaneously know 
the position and energy, or equivalently, the position and momentum. If we know the 
position, there is uncertainty in the energy, and therefore in the momentum. 
The peculiarities of the microscopic world do not end here. Let’s take all those 
molecules that provided us with energy .Ea and orient them in such a way that the 
previously measured position of the electron is to the left of the origin, thus in the1.1 The Need to Abandon Classical Physics 3
Fig. 1.2 An electron 
measured at.R1 has equal 
probabilities of having

measuring the energy, the

vicinity of .R1. Well, let’s now measure the position of the electron again. What we 
find is unbelievable. In half of these molecules, the electron is still in the vicinity 
of .R1, while in the other half, it is in the vicinity of .R2! So, now that we know 
the energy with certainty, we no longer know the position with certainty. If we had 
chosen the set of molecules with energy.Eb, we would have obtained the same result. 
We must conclude that if we know the energy, there is uncertainty in the position. In 
Fig. 1.2, we summarize graphically the results obtained experimentally. It is evident 
that classical physics cannot help us unravel this entanglement. 
As if that weren’t enough, there is another peculiarity. Let’s take the set of 
molecules on which we measured energy .Ea. For each of them, after the measure￾ment, we wait for a time . t and measure the energy again. What we find is that for 
all molecules, the energy is still .Ea. If we had performed the same experiment for 
the molecules with energy .Eb, we would have found the same result, i.e., after a 
time . t, we would always measure .Eb. However, things change when we measure 
the position twice at a time interval. Let’s take the set of molecules on which we 
measured the position and orient them so that, for all of them, the electron is located 
in the vicinity of .R1. If we now wait for a time . t and measure the position of the 
electron again, we find that the electron is in the vicinity of .R1 for some molecules 
and in the vicinity of.R2 for the remaining molecules! To be more precise, what we 
find is that the probability of remeasuring the electron in the vicinity of .R1 after a 
time. t oscillates over time as follows 
.P(R1) = 0.5 × [1 + cos(Ωt)] (1.3) 
where 
.Ω = Eb − Ea

it is the difference between the two possible energies divided by the so-called Planck 
constant . . The constant . was introduced by Planck to explain the blackbody 
spectrum, a topic we do not cover in this book, and it has the dimensions of energy 
times time or, equivalently, momentum times position: 
. = 1.055 × 10−34J · s. (1.5) 
As we see, all the equations of quantum mechanics contain this constant. We also 
observe that the electron can only be found in either .R1 or .R2, and thus the sum of 
the probabilities.P(R1) + P(R2) = 1. From Eq. (1.3), we can then deduce: 
.P(R2) = 0.5 × [1 − cos(Ωt)]. (1.6) 
In Fig. 1.3, we graphically summarize this experimental evidence. 
1.2 Quantum Solution—The First Five Postulates 
The solution to the experimental puzzle took years, and we present it in this section. 
As we see, it is necessary to abandon some familiar concepts to understand what 
happens when systems are on the nanoscale. Although the quantum view and the 
quantum rules may seem absurd, we anticipate that they have never been contradicted 
by experiments. 
Let’s begin with a completely general consideration. Physics is a science that uses 
mathematical laws primarily for two purposes:1.2 Quantum Solution—The First Five Postulates 5
(1) To relate the properties of a given system (for example, in the ideal gas law, 
pressure, volume, and temperature of the “ideal gas” system are related). 
(2) To predict how the properties of a given system change over time using time￾differential equations (for example, Newton’s law for the “particle” system or 
Maxwell’s equations for the “electromagnetic field” system). 
For physics to be a quantitative science, all properties must be measurable. In fact, a 
law of physics is valid if and only if it is experimentally verified. Let’s go back to the 
electron in the H. 
+
2 ion discussed in the previous section. We have learned that if we 
measure the position, the result of an energy measurement is not unique. And if we 
measure the energy, the result of a position measurement is not unique either. This 
means that we have no hope of writing equations in terms of position and momentum, 
such as Newton’s equation .
dp
dt = F(r), as these equations would predict a specific 
value of . r and . p, and therefore . r and . E, at every instant of time. The first two 
postulates of quantum mechanics arise from the following observation. Consider 
a measurable property, which we call observable, and take note of the possible 
values of the measurement result. In the case of the H. 
+
2 ion, the measurement of the 
observable position provided only two values, .R1 and .R2. Since it is not possible 
to know anything else with absolute certainty (remember that a subsequent energy 
measurement did not always yield the same value), we must conclude that the electron 
in a H. 
+
2 ion is entirely characterized by the position value alone. We then assign a ket 
.|R1⟩ to the electron when.R1 is measured, and a ket.|R2⟩ when.R2 is measured. These 
kets describe the state of the system. We assume that these kets form the orthonormal 
basis of a Hilbert space. H, thus the scalar product 
.⟨Ri|Rj⟩ = δi j, i, j = 1, 2. (1.7) 
If instead of the position, we had chosen to measure the energy, we could have 
followed the same reasoning. Since it is not possible to know anything else with 
absolute certainty (remember that a subsequent measurement of the position did not 
always provide the same value, see Fig. 1.2), then the electron in a H. 
+
2 ion is entirely 
characterized by the value of the energy. Let’s assign the ket .|Ea⟩ to the electron 
when the energy is measured to be.Ea and the ket.|Eb⟩ when the energy is measured 
to be .Eb. These kets form an orthonormal basis of the same Hilbert space .H (the 
observable has changed, but the system is the same): 
.⟨Ei|E j⟩ = δi j, i, j = a, b (1.8) 
As both.|R1⟩, |R2⟩ and.|Ea⟩, |Eb⟩ form a basis of. H, we can express one set in terms 
of the other as a linear combination: 
.|Ri⟩ = ∑
j=a,b
⟨E j|Ri⟩|E j⟩, |Ei⟩ = ∑
j=1,2
⟨Rj|Ei⟩|Rj⟩. (1.9)6 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
More generally, if we had chosen to measure a generic observable with possible 
values .Oα and .Oβ, we would have assigned the ket .|Oα⟩ to the electron in the first 
case and .|Oβ⟩ in the second case. Furthermore, .|Oα⟩, |Oβ⟩ would have formed an 
orthonormal basis of the same Hilbert space. H. This way of describing the electron 
is at the core of the 
FIRST POSTULATE: 
A system (the electron in a H. 
+
2 in our example) is described by a ket.|ψ⟩ that belongs 
to a Hilbert space. H. 
To determine the ket .|ψ⟩ ∈ H, a measurement is necessary. Let’s suppose we 
want to measure a certain observable (like position or energy in our example of the 
ion H. 
+
2 ), and we indicate the possible values of the measurement as .{Oj}. In our 
example,.{Oj} = (R1, R2) if the observable is the position, and.{Oj} = (Ea, Eb) if 
the observable is the energy. The second postulate states that 
SECOND POSTULATE: 
The system immediately after measuring. Oj is described by the ket.|Oj⟩, regardless 
of the system’s state before the measurement. 
Henceforth we interchangably say that “a system is described by a ket .|ψ⟩” or 
that “the state of the system is the ket .|ψ⟩”. The second postulate is also known 
as the collapse postulate, as if the system is in a general ket .|ψ⟩ just before the 
measurement, it collapses into.|Oj⟩ immediately after the measurement. 
The third postulate of quantum mechanics concerns observables: 
THIRD POSTULATE: 
For every observable that can yield values .Oj upon measurement, the following 
Hermitian operator is associated: 
.Oˆ = ∑
j
Oj|Oj⟩⟨Oj|, (1.10) 
where the.{|Oj⟩} form an orthonormal basis of. H. 
From now on, we put a hat, represented by the symbol “ˆ. ”, above a letter to denote 
an operator. Therefore, if.O is an observable, then.Oˆ is the associated operator,. Oj
are the eigenvalues of. Oˆ, and.|Oj⟩ are the eigenvectors (or better eigenkets) of.Oˆ with 
eigenvalue.Oj . In our example of the electron in the H. 
+
2 ion, the position observable 
and the energy observable are associated with the operators: 
.Rˆ = ∑
j=1,2
Rj|Rj⟩⟨Rj|, Eˆ = ∑
j=a,b
E j|E j⟩⟨E j|. (1.11)1.2 Quantum Solution—The First Five Postulates 7
The first three postulates essentially lay down the mathematical apparatus, and 
by themselves, they do not allow us to compute anything. For this, it is necessary 
to introduce two additional postulates. Thanks to the fourth postulate, we can calcu￾late the probability of measuring a certain value for a given observable. The fourth 
postulate states that 
FOURTH POSTULATE: 
If the system is described by the ket .|ψ⟩ ∈ H with normalization .⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1, then 
the probability.P(Oj) of measuring the value. Oj for the observable. Oˆ is given by 
.P(Oj) = |⟨Oj|ψ⟩|2
. (1.12) 
With the fourth postulate, we can begin to test the mathematical apparatus that 
we are setting up. Let’s consider Fig. 1.2. According to the second postulate, right 
after measuring.R1, the state of the system is.|ψ⟩=|R1⟩. From the fourth postulate, 
the probability of measuring energy.E j is then: 
.P(E j) = |⟨E j|R1⟩|2 0.5 = 1
2
. (1.13) 
In the last identity, we used the experimental data provided by Eq. (1.2). From 
Eq. (1.13), it follows that .⟨E j|R1⟩ = eiθ j /
√2, where .θj are phases that we cannot 
determine at the moment. Taking this result into account in the first of Eq. (1.9), we 
find: 
.|R1⟩ = eiθa
√2
|Ea⟩ + eiθb
√2
|Eb⟩. (1.14) 
The Eq. (1.14) allows us to express the ket.|R2⟩ as a linear combination of.|Ea⟩ and 
.|Eb⟩ since we know that .⟨R2|R2⟩ = 1 and .⟨R1|R2⟩ = 0 (see third postulate). Using 
the first of Eq. (1.9), from.⟨R2|R2⟩ = 1, we find: 
.|⟨Ea|R2⟩|2 + |⟨Eb|R2⟩|2 = 1, (1.15) 
and from.⟨R1|R2⟩ = 0, we find: 
.
e−iθa
√2 ⟨Ea|R2⟩ + e−iθb
√2 ⟨Eb|R2⟩ = 0. (1.16) 
From these last two equations, it is straightforward to derive.⟨Ea|R2⟩ = eiθa /
√2 and 
.⟨Eb|R2⟩=−eiθb /
√2. The reader can independently check that by substituing these 
results into (1.15) and (1.16) we obtain an identity. Thus, 
.|R2⟩ = eiθa
√2
|Ea⟩ − eiθb
√2
|Eb⟩. (1.17)8 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
Well, now we are ready to make some predictions. Let’s assume we have measured 
energy.Ea and, therefore, the system is described by the ket.|Ea⟩. According to the 
fourth postulate, the probability of measuring the position.Ri is: 
.P(Ri) = |⟨Ri|Ea⟩|2 = 1/2, (1.18) 
In the last step, we use Eqs. (1.14) and (1.17). The result we just obtain is in excellent 
agreement with the experiment, see Fig. 1.2. Therefore, from knowing the probabil￾ities of measuring energy after measuring the position, we deduced the probabilities 
of measuring the positions after measuring the energy, and obtained the experimen￾tally correct result. We can also deduce another result. If we measure the position and 
find.R1, then right after the measurement,.|ψ⟩=|R1⟩ (second postulate). According 
to the fourth postulate, the probability of measuring.R1 immediately after is: 
.P(R1) = |⟨R1|R1⟩|2 = 1 (1.19) 
while the probability of measuring.R2 is.P(R2) = |⟨R2|R1⟩|2 = 0. This is precisely 
what is found experimentally. In fact, the experimental probabilities of measuring. R1
and.R2 after a time. t are given by Eqs. (1.3) and (1.6). So, to know the experimental 
probabilities right after the measurement, we need to evaluate Eqs. (1.3) and (1.6) at 
time.t = 0. The experimental result is precisely what the theory predicts. 
The fifth postulate is undoubtedly the most important as it represents the analogue 
of Newton’s equation in classical mechanics. It allows us to calculate the temporal 
evolution of the system’s state. Let’s denote by .|ψ(t)⟩ ∈ H the ket that describes 
the system at time . t. The fifth postulate, also known as the Schrödinger equation, 
states that: 
FIFTH POSTULATE: 
.|ψ(t)⟩ satisfies the following first-order differential equation in time: 
.i d
dt |ψ(t)⟩ = Eˆ|ψ(t)⟩, (1.20) 
where. Eˆ is the energy operator. 
In the case of the electron in the H. 
+
2 ion, the energy operator is given by the second 
equation in Eq. (1.11). In reality, the fifth postulate is slightly more general, but for 
now, we don’t need its full generality. We will come back to it later. 
The Schrödinger equation allows us to calculate the probability of the outcome 
of a measurement at time . t and, therefore, verify the correctness of the theory by 
comparing it with the experiments shown in Fig. 1.3. Let’s start by finding the most 
general solution of the Schrödinger equation in the case of the electron in the H. 
+
2
ion. We expand the generic ket.|ψ(t)⟩ in the basis of eigenkets of. Eˆ:1.2 Quantum Solution—The First Five Postulates 9
.|ψ(t)⟩ = ∑
j=a,b
c j(t)|E j⟩. (1.21) 
The coefficients .c j(t) = ⟨E j|ψ(t)⟩ depend on time because .|ψ(t)⟩ is a function of 
time. The Schrödinger equation provides: 
. i d
dt |ψ(t)⟩ = i 
∑
j=a,b
dc j(t)
dt |E j⟩,
Eˆ|ψ(t)⟩ = ∑
j=a,b
c j(t)Eˆ|E j⟩ = ∑
j=a,b
E j c j(t)|E j⟩. (1.22) 
In the last identity, we use that .Eˆ|E j⟩ = E j|E j⟩. By equating the right-hand sides, 
we find: 
.
∑
j=a,b
(
i 
dc j(t)
dt − E j c j(t)
)
|E j⟩ = 0. (1.23) 
This equation is satisfied if and only if, for each . j, the term in parentheses is zero, 
as the kets.|E j⟩ are mutually orthonormal and, therefore, independent. We therefore 
need to find the solution of the differential equation: 
.i 
dc j(t)
dt − E j c j(t) = 0. (1.24) 
This is a first-order differential equation with constant coefficients and is homoge￾neous. It is easy to verify that the solution is: 
.c j(t) = e−iE j t/ c j(0). (1.25) 
Evaluating this equation at.t = 0, we correctly find.c j(0) = c j(0). Alright, now let’s 
turn to the experiments in Fig. 1.3. 
In the first experiment, we perform a measurement of energy and find the value.Ea . 
Therefore, according to the second postulate, immediately after the measurement, 
the system is described by the ket.|Ea⟩. Let’s choose the time of measurement as the 
initial instant, that is,.t = 0, and write.|ψ(0)⟩=|Ea⟩. From Eq. (1.21) evaluated at 
.t = 0, we obtain the initial conditions for the coefficients:.ca(0) = 1 and.cb(0) = 0. 
Therefore, the ket at time. t is: 
.|ψ(t)⟩ = e−iEa t/ |Ea⟩. (1.26) 
According to the fourth postulate, the probability of measuring.Ea at time. t is: 
.P(Ea) = |⟨Ea|ψ(t)⟩|2 = 1, (1.27) 
which is in agreement with the experiment, see Fig. 1.3.10 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
Let’s now move to the second experiment. In this case, at time.t = 0, a measure￾ment of position is performed, and the result is .R1. Therefore, based on the second 
postulate, the state at time.t = 0 is.|ψ(0)⟩=|R1⟩. Using Eq. (1.14), it follows that: 
.|ψ(0)⟩ = ca(0)|Ea⟩ + cb(0)|Eb⟩=|R1⟩ = eiθa
√2
|Ea⟩ + eiθb
√2
|Eb⟩. (1.28) 
From this, we obtain the initial conditions for the coefficients: 
.ca(0) = eiθa
√2
, cb(0) = eiθb
√2
. (1.29) 
Therefore, in the second experiment, the ket at time. t is given by: 
.|ψ(t)⟩ = eiθa−iEa t/ 
√2 |Ea⟩ + eiθb−iEbt/ 
√2 |Eb⟩. (1.30) 
According to the fourth postulate, the probability of measuring.R1 at time. t is: 
.P(R1) = |⟨R1|ψ(t)⟩|

From Eq. (1.14), we have:

which is in perfect agreement with the experimental data in Eq. (1.3). 
1.3 Expectation Value, Variance, and General 
Considerations 
In the previous section, we have laid the foundations of quantum mechanics. In addi￾tion to the mathematical framework that we will explore further, we have introduced 
a completely new description of the world around us. To begin with, if we measure 
a certain observable on a large number of systems, all prepared in the same way, 
the result is not always the same! We can’t help it; that’s how the world works at1.4 Observables with Continuum Spectrum and Wavefunction 11
the nanoscale. The best we can predict is not the value of the measurement but the 
probability of obtaining that measurement. 
The results of measuring a given observable are the eigenvalues.Oj of the operator 
.Oˆ associated with that observable. The probability of measuring a certain.Oj is given 
by .P(Oj) = |⟨Oj|ψ⟩|2, where .|ψ⟩ is the ket that describes the state of the system 
at the instant the measurement is performed, and .|Oj⟩ is the eigenket of .Oˆ with 
eigenvalue.Oj . 
From the knowledge of probabilities, we can calculate the average value, also 
known as the expectation value, of an observable: 
.⟨Oˆ⟩ = ∑
j
P(Oj)Oj = ∑
j
⟨ψ|Oj⟩Oj⟨Oj|ψ⟩=⟨ψ|Oˆ|ψ⟩, (1.34) 
where, in the last step, we use Eq. (1.10) from the third postulate, which states that 
.
∑
j Oj|Oj⟩⟨Oj| = Oˆ. We can also get an idea of the probability distribution by 
calculating the variance, or standard deviation, defined as the square root of: 
.σ2
O = ∑
j
P(Oj)O2
j − ⟨Oˆ⟩
2 = ∑
j
P(Oj)(Oj − ⟨Oˆ⟩)
2 = ⟨(
Oˆ − ⟨Oˆ⟩
)2
⟩. (1.35) 
The smaller.σ2
O is, the larger the probabilities.P(Oj) are when.Oj ∼ ⟨Oˆ⟩, and they 
are small otherwise. In these cases, the measurement of the observable always gives a 
result very close to.⟨Oˆ⟩. At macroscopic scales, the variances are very small, and the 
average values of observables, such as position and momentum, satisfy the equations 
of Newton. Therefore, classical mechanics follows from quantum mechanics by 
identifying classical quantities with quantum average values. 
However, there are still several open questions to investigate before showing the 
transition from quantum mechanics to classical mechanics. For example: Why does 
the minimum of measurable energy in the H. 
+
2 ion not coincide with that of classical 
physics? How do we write the observables position and energy in systems other 
than the H. 
+
2 ion? To proceed, it is necessary to introduce one final postulate. Before 
doing so, however, we must discuss the concept of probability density and then the 
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism of classical physics. 
1.4 Observables with Continuum Spectrum 
and Wavefunction 
In nature, there exist many “one-dimensional” systems. These are systems that extend 
along one direction over nearly microscopic distances (of the order of.10−6–.10−7 m), 
while they are confined along the other two directions, extending over nanoscopic 
distances (of the order of.10−8–.10−9 m). Examples of such systems include carbon 
nanotubes, polymer chains, the so-called quantum wires, and more. Let’s consider12 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
Fig. 1.4 Probability histogram of measuring the electron in a vicinity of. xn
having one of these one-dimensional systems available, and we choose the coordinate 
system so that the .x-axis aligns with the longest direction, the microscopic one. 
Suppose we are interested in measuring the position of an electron within this system, 
and we set up detectors along the system. Detectors are devices that emit a “click” 
when an electron is in their vicinity. Let.∆ represent the extent of the detectors, and 
let’s arrange them next to each other at positions.x j = j∆, as illustrated in Fig. 1.4. 
Now, imagine preparing our electron in a certain state described by the ket.|ψ⟩ and 
immediately hearing a click. If the click comes from the .n-th detector, then right 
after the measurement, we know that the electron is within a vicinity of.∆ around. xn, 
and the state ket.|ψ⟩ collapses (according to the postulate) onto the ket that describes 
the electron within this vicinity of . xn. Let’s denote this ket as .|n⟩. By repeating the 
experiment a large number.K ≫ 1 of times (each time preparing the electron in the 
same state.|ψ⟩) and noting, for each detector, the number.kn of times the click comes 
from the. nth detector, we can construct the probability 
.P(n) = kn
K (1.36) 
of measuring the electron within a vicinity of. xn. An example of these probabilities is 
depicted in Fig. 1.4 as a histogram. According to the fourth postulate, this probability 
is identical to 
.P(n) = |⟨n|ψ⟩|
2 . (1.37) 
Immediately after the click of, let’s say, the detector at. xn, the electron is located 
within a vicinity of. xn, and thus the probability of finding it within a vicinity of. xn'
with .n' /= n is zero. According to the collapse postulate, right after the click, the 
electron is described by.|n⟩, and therefore the probability of finding it at.xn' is given1.4 Observables with Continuum Spectrum and Wavefunction 13
by .P(n'
) = |
|⟨n'
|n⟩
|
|
2
. Since this probability must be zero for .n' /= n and unity for 
.n' = n, we conclude that 
.⟨n'
|n⟩ = δnn'. (1.38) 
The experiment just conducted justifies the final part of the third postulate. In fact, 
the third postulate tells us that the position operator is given by 
.xˆ = ∑
n
(n∆)|n⟩⟨n| (1.39) 
and that the kets.|n⟩form an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space.H of our electron. 
As we have just seen from Eq. (1.38), the fact that the kets .|n⟩ are orthonormal 
expresses a natural physical conclusion arising from the collapse and the fourth 
postulate. The fact that they form a basis can be justified experimentally in the 
following manner. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that they are not a basis. 
Hence, there must exist a ket.|χ⟩ orthogonal to all the.|n⟩. If we were to prepare the 
initial state of the electron in .|ψ⟩=|χ⟩, then the probability that the .n-th detector 
clicks would be .|⟨n|χ⟩|
2 = 0 for all . n. But this would imply that the electron is 
nowhere, which is absurd. 
Having established that the.|n⟩ are an orthonormal basis, we can expand a general 
state ket .|ψ⟩ in this basis. For any general orthonormal basis, the completeness 
relation holds, also known as the resolution of the identity, 
.
∑

|n⟩⟨n| = 1ˆ (1.40) 
and therefore 
.|ψ⟩ = ∑
n
|n⟩⟨n|ψ⟩ = ∑
n
ψn|n⟩, with ψn = ⟨n|ψ⟩. (1.41) 
As seen from Eq. (1.37), the probability of finding the electron within a vicinity of. xn
is simply the square modulus of.⟨n|ψ⟩:.P(n) = |⟨n|ψ⟩|2. It’s important to note that 
these probabilities sum up to one, i.e.,.
∑
n P(n) = 1, only if the ket.|ψ⟩is normalized 
to one, i.e.,.⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1. In fact,

|ψ⟩ =
= ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ (1.42) 
So, if the ket.|ψ⟩ is not normalized to unity, the sum of the probabilities does not add 
up to unity. From an interpretational standpoint, nothing changes, of course, in the 
sense that the ket.|ψ⟩ and the ket.C|ψ⟩, with. C being an arbitrary complex number,14 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
describe the same physical state. However, the sum of probabilities in the second 
case is .|C|
2 times larger. To obtain probabilities normalized to unity, it is sufficient 
to divide by .|C|
2. It is also noteworthy that if .C = eiθ with . θ being real, then both 
.|ψ⟩ and .C|ψ⟩ = eiθ|ψ⟩ are normalized to unity. Therefore, normalization alone is 
not enough to uniquely determine the state ket. However, this arbitrariness doesn’t 
affect the physical results in any way, as the phase factor always cancels out. In other 
words, we are free to choose the phase. θ we want, as long as once the choice is made, 
we consistently use in all derivation the chosen phase. 
Let’s now suppose that we are able to construct increasingly precise detectors, 
thereby reducing the space.∆ they occupy. Ideally, we are interested in the limiting 
case of practically point-like detectors, which corresponds to the limit .∆ → 0. As 
.∆ approaches zero, the probability of measuring an electron within a vicinity .∆ of 
.xn tends to zero. It’s much more useful in this case to talk about the probability 
of finding the electron within a certain spatial interval. Therefore, we introduce the 
concept of probability density defined as, 
. P(xn) = lim
∆→0
P(n)
∆ = lim
∆→0
|ψn|
2
∆ (1.43) 
From this definition, it follows that if we wanted to know the probability of finding 
the electron between two points .xa and . xb, we would need to calculate the integral 
.
ʃ xb
xa dxP(x). Equation (1.43) also suggests defining what is known as the wavefunc￾tion, 
. ψ(xn) = lim
∆→0
ψn √∆
(1.44) 
so that we can rewrite the probability density directly as 
. P(x) = |ψ(x)|
2 (1.45) 
In the limit .∆ → 0, it is also convenient to define unnormalized kets. Nothing 
too complex, so don’t be alarmed. Let’s consider the expansion of the ket .|ψ⟩ in 
Eq. (1.41). It can be rewritten as, 
.|ψ⟩ = ∑
n
∆
ψn √∆
|n⟩
√∆ , (1.46) 
where we have simply multiplied and divided by. ∆. If we define the kets (remember 
that.xn = n∆) 
. |xn⟩ = lim
∆→0
|n⟩
√∆
(1.47)1.4 Observables with Continuum Spectrum and Wavefunction 15
then in the limit.∆ → 0, the expansion in Eq. (1.46) yields 
.|ψ⟩ = lim
∆→0
∑
n
∆ ψ(xn)|xn⟩ = ʃ
dx ψ(x)|x⟩, (1.48) 
where in the last step we used the definition of an integral. Note that the wave function 
can also be written as the inner product between.|xn⟩ and.|ψ⟩, as per Eq. (1.44), 
.ψ(xn) = lim
∆→0
⟨n|ψ⟩
√∆
= ⟨xn|ψ⟩. (1.49) 
The reason the kets.|xn⟩ are not normalized becomes evident. We find that 
.⟨xn'|xn⟩ = lim
∆→0
⟨n'
|n⟩
∆ = lim
∆→0
δnn'
∆ , (1.50) 
thus the normalization tends to infinity for .n = n'
. This fact is not problematic for 
two reasons. Firstly, as we have already pointed out, the physical state of a system is 
independent of the normalization of the ket, and therefore it remains well-defined. 
In our case, the ket.|x⟩ describes an electron exactly at. x (rather than in its vicinity as 
the kets .|n⟩ did). Secondly, in all mathematical expressions, the divergence caused 
by the .1/∆ factor is compensated by infinitesimals of order . ∆, as can be seen, for 
example, in Eq. (1.46), and ultimately, the results of calculations are always finite. 
Equation (1.50) can be rewritten in a more familiar form. Let’s consider the integral 
of a function. f (x) multiplied by the Dirac delta function 1 .δ(x − x'
): 
.
ʃ
dxf (x)δ(x − x'
) = f (x'
). (1.51) 
Dividing the .x-axis into intervals of length .∆ and defining as before .xn = n∆ and 
.xn' = n'
∆, we can approximate Eq. (1.51) as 
.
∑
n
∆f (xn)δ(xn − xn') f (xn'), (1.52) 
where the symbol . becomes an equality in the limit .∆ → 0. The equation above 
implies that .∆δ(xn − xn') δnn' or equivalently .δ(xn − xn') δnn'/∆. Taking the 
limit.∆ → 0, we then conclude that 
.δ(xn − xn') = lim
∆→0
δnn'
∆ . (1.53)
1 For the definition and properties of the Dirac delta function, please refer to Appendix A. 16 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
Therefore, Eq. (1.50) tells us that the inner product between two unnormalized kets 
.|x⟩ and.|x'
⟩ is equal to the Dirac delta function.δ(x − x'
): 
. ⟨x'
|x⟩ = δ(x − x'
) (1.54) 
There are two more important relations to derive in the limit.∆ → 0. The first one 
concerns the position operator in Eq. (1.39). Multiplying and dividing by. ∆, taking 
into account that.xn = n∆, and using the definition in Eq. (1.47), we find in the limit 
.∆ → 0: 
.xˆ = lim

√∆
⟨n|
√∆ = lim

∑

∆ xn|xn⟩⟨xn| = ʃ

The second one concerns the resolution of the identity in Eq. (1.40). Again, multi￾plying and dividing by. ∆, we find in the limit.∆ → 0: 
. lim

We can easily verify the correctness of this latter identity as follows: 
. |ψ⟩ = 1ˆ|ψ⟩ = ʃ
dx |x⟩⟨x|ψ⟩ = ʃ
dx ψ(x)|x⟩ (1.57) 
and the last expression matches that of Eq. (1.48). 
The position operator in Eq. (1.55) is an operator with continuum spectrum, 
meaning that its eigenvalues are all possible values of . x (a set isomorphic to the 
set of real numbers and therefore continuous). We will encounter other continuous 
spectrum operators such as momentum or energy. These operators have the form: 
.Oˆ =
ʃ
dO O|O⟩⟨O| (1.58) 
and the kets.|O⟩ have a scalar product: 
.⟨O'
|O⟩ = δ(O − O'
). (1.59) 
It’s straightforward to verify that the ket.|O⟩ is an eigenket of.Oˆ with eigenvalue. O: 
.Oˆ|O⟩ = ʃ

|O⟩ = ʃ

and the resolution of the identity becomes: 
.

d O|O⟩⟨O| = 1. (1.61) 
1.5 Langrangian and Hamiltonian Formalism 
To formulate the last postulate, we need to introduce the Lagrangian formalism first, 
followed by the Hamiltonian formalism 
1.5.1 Lagrangian Formalism—Euler-Lagrange Equations 
The Lagrangian formalism is particularly useful for solving classical mechanics 
problems where particles are subject to both external forces and constraint forces 
that limit their motion. Consider, for instance, a ball constrained to move inside a 
rigid tube shaped like a semicircle with radius. R, as illustrated in Fig. 1.5 (left). This 
ball will experience both gravitational forces and constraint forces that confine its 
motion along the tube. In the presence of constraints, it’s convenient to express the 
particle’s coordinate. r in terms of the degrees of freedom that we find most suitable. 
Let’s consider the example of Fig. 1.5 (left) again and choose a reference frame with 
the origin at the center of the circle, the.z-axis orthogonal to the circle, and the.x-axis 
passing through the endpoints of the semicircle along which the particle moves. The 
particle’s coordinates must then satisfy the constraints, 
.z = 0, y = √
R2 − x 2. (1.62) 
Fig. 1.5 Examples of constrained motion. Left: a particle is constrained to move along a semicircle. 
Right: a particle is constrained to move on the surface of a paraboloid18 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
So, the only degree of freedom is.x ∈ (−R, R), and the entire coordinate. r = (x, y,z)
can be expressed in terms of. x:.r = r(x) = (x,
√R2 − x 2, 0). Alternatively, we could 
have expressed the constraint in terms of the angle. θ that the vector. r forms with the 
.x-axis: 
.z = 0, x = R cos θ, y = R sin θ. (1.63) 
In this case, the only degree of freedom is .θ ∈ (0, π), and the entire coordinate 
.r = (x, y,z) can be expressed in terms of. θ:.r = r(θ) = (R cos θ, R sin θ, 0). 
The number.M of degrees of freedom depends on the constraints; a particle in 3 
dimensions subject to.K ≤ 3 constraints has.M = 3 − K degrees of freedom. In our 
example, we have .K = 2 constraints (one enforcing.z = 0, and the other relating. x
and . y), so the number of degrees of freedom is .M = 3 − 2 = 1. An example of a 
particle subjected to a single constraint is illustrated in Fig. 1.5 (right). In this case, 
the particle is confined to move on the surface of a paraboloid, so the coordinates. x
and . y can vary between .−∞ and .∞, and for a certain combination of . x and . y, the 
coordinate. z is given by 
.z = x 2 + y2
. (1.64) 
We therefore have a single constraint (.K = 1) and.M = 3 − K = 2 degrees of free￾dom, namely. x and. y. The entire coordinate.r = (x, y,z) can be expressed in terms of 
. x and. y in this case:.r = r(x, y) = (x, y, x 2 + y2). Even in the case of the paraboloid, 
the choice of degrees of freedom is not unique. For instance, we could express the 
particle’s coordinates as 
.x = cos θ, y = sin θ, z = 2
, (1.65) 
and let the angle. θ vary in the interval.(0, 2π) and the length. range from. 0 to.∞. In 
this case, the degrees of freedom are. θ and. , and the entire coordinate. r = (x, y,z)
can be expressed in terms of them:.r = r(θ, ) = ( cos θ, sin θ, 2). 
We denote by.q = (q1,..., qM ) the set of degrees of freedom that we choose to 
use. In the example of the tube, we could choose.q = (q1) = (x) or.q = (q1) = (θ), 
while in the case of the paraboloid, we could choose .q = (q1, q2) = (x, y) or . q =
(q1, q2) = (θ, ). As we have seen, the coordinate. r can be expressed in terms of the 
degrees of freedom . q: .r = r(q). Denoting the mass of the particle as . m, Newton’s 
equations tell us that 
.m d2r
dt 2 = F + Fconstr (1.66) 
where . F is the active force (gravitational, electromagnetic, etc.), while .Fconstr is the 
force due to constraints. Constraint forces are always orthogonal to the infinitesimal 
displacements.δr that the particle can undergo, and therefore they are orthogonal to 
its velocity.v = dr/dt. It follows that1.5 Langrangian and Hamiltonian Formalism 19

where we have defined the square of the velocity vector as.v2 = v · v. 
Now let’s move on to the active forces. In general,. F depends not only explicitly 
on time . t but also on both the particle’s position and velocity: .F = F(r, v, t). Let 
.(Fx , Fy , Fz
) be the three components of the force acting on the particle, and let 
.r = (x, y,z) and.v = (vx , vy , vz
) be the components of its position and velocity. In 
what follows, we assume that forces can be written as

where .U = U(r, v, t) is a function that can depend on time and the position and

includes not only gravitational and elastic forces but also the Lorentz force. Let’s 
manipulate the second term of Eq. (1.67)20 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics

The quantity

is called Lagrangian of the system. Since Eq. (1.76) must hold for all physical 
trajectories, and the degrees of freedom. q are independent of each other, it follows that 
each term in the sum must be zero. This leads us to the Euler-Lagrange equations

The advantage of these equations is that they are equations for the degrees of free￾dom, so we don’t need to worry about including additional equations to describe the 
constraints. Moreover, the Euler-Lagrange equations are relatively straightforward 
to derive once .L = L(q, q˙, t) is known. To obtain the latter, it suffices to express 
.T and .U in terms of . r and . v and then express the latter in terms of . q and . q˙ using 
Eq. (1.68). 
1.5.2 Classical Particle in an Electromagnetic Field

where the right hand side is the Lorentz force with electric field .E(r, t) and mag￾netic field .B(r, t). Since there are no constraints, we can choose the degrees of 
freedom .{q} = (x, y,z) to be precisely the coordinates of the particle, and thus 
.{ ˙q} = (vx , vy , vz

1.5.3 Hamiltonian Formalism—Legendre 
Transform—Hamilton’s Equations 
The Lagrangian formalism leads to .M second-order differential equations in time 
for the.M degrees of freedom.{q}, which are precisely the Euler-Lagrange equations.1.5 Langrangian and Hamiltonian Formalism 23
In contrast, the Hamiltonian formalism allows us to have only first-order differential 
equations in time. The price to pay, as we see, is that the number of equations doubles. 
Before introducing the Hamiltonian formalism, let’s take a brief digression into 
what is known as the Legendre transform. Consider a function . f (x, y) and write 
its variation due to a change in the independent variables. x and. y
.d f = ∂ f
∂x dx +
∂ f
∂y
dy. (1.90) 
The functions.u = ∂ f
∂x and.v = ∂ f
∂y
are also functions of. x and. y. By inverting.u = ∂ f
∂x , 
we can express. x in terms of. u and. y:.x = x(u, y). The Legendre transform involves 
constructing a function.g(u, y) based on the function. f : 
.g(u, y) = ux(u, y) − f (x(u, y), y). (1.91) 
The function . g is called the Legendre transform of the function . f . What is special 
about. g is that its variation due to changes in. u and. y can be expressed as follows: 
.dg = udx + xdu − d f (1.92) 
and taking into account that.d f = udx + vdy we find 
.dg = xdu − vdy. (1.93) 
Therefore.x(u, y) and.v(u, y) can be obtained from 
.x = ∂g
∂u
, v = −∂g
∂y
. (1.94) 
Let’s return to our Lagrangian. From a mathematical perspective, the function 
.L({q},{ ˙q}, t) can be seen as a function of the independent variables.{q},.{ ˙q}, and. t. 
If these variables undergo an infinitesimal variation, the Lagrangian varies according 
to the chain rule: 
.dL = ∑
α
( ∂L
∂qα
dqα +
∂L
∂q˙α
dq˙α
)
+
∂L
∂t
dt. (1.95) 
We define the conjugate momentum to the variable.qα as 
. pα = ∂L
∂q˙α
(1.96) 
We thus have.M conjugate momenta, each a function of.{q},.{ ˙q}, and. t. Taking into 
account the Euler-Lagrange equations, we can rewrite Eq. (1.95) as24 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
.dL = ∑
α
(p˙αdqα + pαdq˙α) +
∂L
∂t
dt. (1.97) 
Now, we use the definition of the conjugate momenta to express the .q˙α in terms of 
.{q},.{p}, and. t, and we construct the following Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, 
known as the Hamiltonian, 
. H({q},{p}, t) = ∑
α
q˙α pα − L({q},{ ˙q}, t) (1.98) 
The variation of.H due to an infinitesimal variation of.{q},.{p} and. t is 
.d H = ∑
α
(q˙αdpα + pαdq˙α) − dL = ∑
α
(q˙αdpα − ˙pαdqα) − ∂L
∂t
dt (1.99) 
where in the last step we use Eq. (1.97). Moreover, the following relation holds as

.d H = ∑

(∂H

By equating the differentials, we obtain the Hamilton’s equations 
. p˙α = − ∂H
∂qα
, q˙α = ∂H
∂ pα
, ∂H
∂t = −∂L
∂t (1.101) 
These are first-order differential equations in time for .2M functions, namely the 
set of degrees of freedom .{q} and their conjugate momenta .{p}. Therefore, to use 
this formulation, one needs to (1) write the Lagrangian, (2) calculate the conjugate 
momenta and express the velocities .{ ˙q} in terms of .{q} and .{p}, (3) perform the 
Legendre transform of .L to obtain . H, and finally (4) use .H to write down the 
Hamilton’s equations. 
The Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics is particularly useful for 
generalizing the fifth postulate of quantum mechanics. However, before doing so, 
we want to demonstrate that the Hamiltonian is, under certain conditions, indeed the 
energy of the system. The Lagrangian. L is the difference between the kinetic energy 
and the function. U. If the latter does not depend on velocities, then it coincides with 
the potential energy.V of the system: 
.
∂U
∂q˙α
= 0 ⇒ U = V({q}). (1.102) 
In fact, from Eq. (1.72), we have .F = −∇U, and therefore the work done to move 
the particle from one point . r to another point . r' does not depend on the path. Now1.5 Langrangian and Hamiltonian Formalism 25
let’s turn to the kinetic energy . T . Since .v = ∑

have

So, to summarize, the Hamiltonian coincides with the energy of the system if the 
forces are conservative. 
It’s easy to show that if the potential energy.V doesn’t explicitly depend on time, 
then, as it should, the energy is conserved. Indeed,

where in the last step we use the Hamilton’s equations. 
1.5.4 Symmetries and Conservation Laws—Poisson Bracket 
In physics, there exists a close connection between the symmetries of the Hamil￾tonian and conservation laws. What is meant by symmetry? We have seen that the 
Hamiltonian, denoted as .H = H({p},{q}, t), is a function of the system’s degrees 
of freedom and their conjugate momenta. Under an infinitesimal variation of both, 
i.e.,.pα → pα + δ pα and.qα → qα + δqα, the Hamiltonian changes by the amount 
.δH = ∑
α
(∂H
∂qα
δqα +
∂H
∂ pα
δ pα
)
. (1.107) 
The changes for which.δH = 0 are referred to as a symmetry of. H. For instance, in 
the case of a free particle (thus in the absence of an external potential),.H = p2
2m and 
therefore the variations .δ p = 0 and .δq = ϵ (with . ϵ infinitesimal) form a symmetry 
because in this case, .δH = 0. Any infinitesimal variation of .{p} and .{q} can be26 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
expressed in terms of an infinitesimal parameter . ϵ and a function .G({p},{q}, t), 
known as the generating function, in the following way 
.δ pα = −ϵ
∂G
∂qα
, δqα = ϵ
∂G
∂ pα
. (1.108) 
For the previous example with.δ p = 0 and.δq = ϵ, the function.G = p. Substituting 
Eq. (1.108) into Eq. (1.107), we find 
.δH = ϵ
∑
α
(∂H
∂qα
∂G
∂ pα
− ∂H
∂ pα
∂G
∂qα
)
≡ ϵ{H, G}, (1.109) 
where we have defined the Poisson bracket for two arbitrary functions. f1({p},{q}, t)
and. f2({p},{q}, t) as 
. { f1, f2} ≡ ∑
α
(∂ f1
∂qα
∂ f2
∂ pα
− ∂ f1
∂ pα
∂ f2
∂qα
)
= −{ f2, f1} (1.110) 
We can then say that if the generating function .G has a zero Poisson bracket with 
the Hamiltonian. H, then the variation generated by.G is a symmetry since.δH = 0. 
Now, let’s assume we calculate the generating function. G along a physical trajectory, 
meaning for values of.{p} and.{q} that satisfy the Hamilton’s equations. We have 
. 
dG
dt = ∑

− ∂G
∂ pα
∂H
∂qα
)
+
∂G
∂t
= −{H, G} + ∂G
∂t (1.111) 
We can conclude that if .G generates a symmetry (thus .{H, G} = 0) and if .G does 
not explicitly depend on time (hence .
∂G
∂t = 0), then .G does not change over time, 
or in other words, the quantity .G is conserved: .
dG
dt = 0. In the example of a free 
particle,.G = p is a symmetry, and thus momentum is a conserved quantity. This is 
a beautiful property of all the laws of physics: if a quantity is conserved over time, 
then the system is invariant under a certain transformation. 
Poisson brackets are particularly simple when we choose the functions. f1 and. f2
to be one a degree of freedom, i.e., . f1 = qμ, and the other a conjugate momentum, 
i.e.,. f2 = pν . In this case, we have 
.{qμ, pν } = ∑

If, on the other hand, both functions are either both degrees of freedom or both 
conjugate momenta, we have 
.{qμ, qν }={pμ, pν } = 0. (1.113) 
1.6 The Sixth Postulate 
The sixth and final postulate of quantum mechanics is known as the Dirac postulate, 
which allows us to calculate scalar products between eigenstates of one observable 
and those of another. As seen, based on the third postulate, to each observable, a 
Hermitian operator is associated. Consider a system characterized by the degrees 
of freedom.{q}, and let.{p} be their conjugate momenta. In quantum mechanics, we 
associate each.qα with a Hermitian operator.qˆα and each.pβ with a Hermitian operator 
.pˆβ. According to the sixth postulate, these operators must satisfy the following 
commutation rules: 
SIXTH POSTULATE: 
. qˆα pˆβ − ˆpβqˆα = [ˆqα, pˆβ] = i δαβ (1.114) 
. [ ˆqα, qˆβ]=[ˆpα, pˆβ] = 0 (1.115) 
with . being the Planck constant. In other words, the Poisson brackets of classical 
mechanics are replaced by a commutator, and the Kronecker delta is multiplied by 
the factor. i . Degrees of freedom commute with their conjugate momenta only when 
the Planck constant . is zero. As we see, the results of quantum mechanics reduce 
to those of classical mechanics in the limit. → 0. 
Thanks to the sixth postulate, we can practically compute everything. Let’s start 
with an example. Consider a particle in one dimension, and denote by. x its coordinate 
and by . p its conjugate momentum. The quantum operators associated with these 
observables are the position operator and the momentum operator, see Eqs. (1.58) 
and (1.59), 
. xˆ =

dx x|x⟩⟨x|, pˆ =

dp p|p⟩⟨p| (1.116) 
with scalar product.⟨x|x'
⟩ = δ(x − x'
) and.⟨p|p'
⟩ = δ(p − p'
). We are here assum￾ing that the spectrum, that is, the possible measurable values, is continuous for both 
cases. This assumption is supported by numerous experimental pieces of evidence. 
Now, since both .{|x⟩} and .{|p⟩} form a basis for the same Hilbert space . H, we can 
expand one in terms of the other. From Eq. (1.61)28 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
.|p⟩ = ʃ
dx ⟨x|p⟩|x⟩, |x⟩ = ʃ
dp ⟨p|x⟩|p⟩. (1.117) 
But what is the value of the scalar product.⟨x|p⟩? Clearly, without this information, 
we cannot perform either the change of basis or calculate many quantities of interest. 
For example, let’s suppose we measure the momentum and obtain the value . p. 
The particle then collapses into the state .|p⟩. If we are interested in the probability 
density of finding the particle at position . x immediately after the measurement, 
according to the fourth postulate, we should calculate .|⟨x|p⟩|2. The knowledge of 
these scalar products is thus fundamental; without them, quantum mechanics would 
be an incomplete theory. The sixth postulate precisely serves to fill this gap. Let’s 
see how to proceed. 
We define the commutator 
.Qˆ n = [ˆx, pˆ
n]. (1.118) 
Using the identity .[Aˆ, BˆCˆ]=[Aˆ, Bˆ]Cˆ + Bˆ[Aˆ,Cˆ] with .Aˆ = ˆx, .Bˆ = ˆp and . Cˆ =
pˆn−1 we find

The ket .e− ia pˆ
 |x⟩ is therefore proportional to the eigenket of the position operator 
with eigenvalue.(x + a), namely 
.e− ia pˆ
 |x⟩ = C|x + a⟩. (1.121) 
It is immediately apparent that .C = 1 because, as the operator . pˆ is Hermitian, the 
operator.e− ia pˆ
 is unitary and thus does not affect the normalization. Indeed, by taking 
the scalar product of both sides of the equation above with themselves, we find

Therefore

For a system with .M degrees of freedom, a possible basis for the Hilbert space 
.H is formed by the set of kets.|{q}⟩ = |q1 ... qM ⟩, which are simultaneous eigenkets 
of all the operators.qˆα with eigenvalue. qα: 
.qˆα|q1 ... qM ⟩ = qα|q1 ... qM ⟩. (1.129) 
Indeed, all the operators.qˆα commute with each other, see Eq. (1.115), and therefore 
they are simultaneously diagonalizable on an orthonormal basis

2)... δ(qM − q'
M ). (1.130)30 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
It’s important to appreciate the physics hidden behind this scalar product. If we had 
detectors to measure the observables . qˆ1, ...., .qˆM , then the ket .|q1 ... qM ⟩ ∈ H cor￾responds to the system’s state when all these detectors simultaneously measure and 
yield the values.q1 ... qM . If the system is described by the ket.|ψ⟩ ∈ H, according 
to the fourth postulate, the probability for this measurement to occur is 
.P(q1,..., qM ) = |⟨q1 ... qM |ψ⟩|2
. (1.131) 
It follows that the probability for the system to have degrees of freedom. q'
1,..., q'
M
immediately after the measurement is zero unless.q'
1 = q1,....,.q'
M = qM . The Dirac 
deltas in Eq. (1.130) precisely express this fact. The reason why Dirac deltas appear 
and not Kronecker deltas is connected to the fact that the spectra of the operators. qˆ1, 
....,.qˆM are continuous, as discussed in Sect. 1.4. As in the case of a single degree of 
freedom, Eq. (1.130) also tells us how to generalize the resolution of the identity: 
.1ˆ =
ʃ
dq1 ... dqM |q1 ... qM ⟩⟨q1 ... qM |. (1.132) 
One can easily convince oneself of the correctness of this equation by multiplying 
both sides by.|q'
1 ... q'
M ⟩ and using Eq. (1.130). 
Alternatively, instead of the basis.|q1 ... qM ⟩, we could choose as a basis the set of 
kets.|{p}⟩ = |p1 ... pM ⟩ ∈ H, which are simultaneous eigenkets of all the operators 
.pˆα with eigenvalue.pα: 
.pˆα|p1 ... pM ⟩ = pα|p1 ... pM ⟩. (1.133) 
Indeed, the operators.pˆα also commute with each other, and therefore they are simul￾taneously diagonalizable on an orthonormal basis 
.⟨p1 ... pM |p'
1 ... p'
M ⟩ = δ(p1 − p'
1)δ(p2 − p'
2)... δ(pM − p'
M ), (1.134) 
from which follows the resolution of the identity in the momentum basis 
.1ˆ =
ʃ
dp1 ... dpM |p1 ... pM ⟩⟨p1 ... pM |. (1.135) 
More generally, we can construct a basis from the simultaneous eigenkets 
.|O1 ... OM ⟩ ∈ H of .M independent observables .Oˆα that all commute with each 
other. For example, if we have a system with three degrees of freedom, the observ￾ables.qˆ1, pˆ2, qˆ3 all commute with each other, and therefore a possible basis is the set 
of kets.|q1 p2q3⟩. 
The calculation of the scalar product between a ket .|q1 ... qM ⟩ (eigenket of the 
operators . qˆα) and a ket .|p1 ... pM ⟩ (eigenket of the operators .pˆα) is carried out in 
the same way as we did for the case of a single degree of freedom. Using the same 
manipulations, we have1.7 Generalization of the Fifth Postulate: Schrödinger Equation 31

1.7 Generalization of the Fifth Postulate: Schrödinger 
Equation 
The fifth postulate was stated in Sect. 1.2, essentially consisting of the Schrödinger 
equation. However, when it was introduced, we didn’t yet have the tools to construct 
the energy operator for a general system with.M degrees of freedom. Now we have 
all the tools. Let .H({q},{p}, t) be the Hamiltonian of a system with .M degrees of 
freedom. Given.|ψ0⟩ ∈ H as the ket describing the system at time zero, the evolution 
of this ket is governed by the Schrödinger equation32 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
. i d
dt |ψ(t)⟩ = H({ ˆq},{ ˆp}, t)|ψ(t)⟩ ≡ Hˆ(t)|ψ(t)⟩ (1.142) 
with the initial condition.|ψ(0)⟩=|ψ0⟩. Note that.Hˆ(t) ≡ H({ ˆq},{ ˆp}, t)is an oper￾ator since the function.H is a function of operators. In the case of conservative forces, 
like the Coulomb force,.H is indeed the energy of the system. As we see, the Hamil￾tonian is always a Hermitian operator. 
From the Schrödinger equation follows an important theorem concerning the time 
dependence of the expectation values of observables. Consider a general observable 
. Oˆ. If the system is described by the ket.|ψ(t)⟩ at time. t, its expectation value at this 
time is given by.⟨ψ(t)|Oˆ|ψ(t)⟩. Therefore, the temporal variation of the expectation 
value is 
.

meaning it is equal to.i/ times the expectation value of the commutator between the 
Hamiltonian and the operator itself. This result is known as the Ehrenfest theorem. 
Let’s now discuss a case that is encountered frequently, namely that of a time￾independent Hamiltonian. Let.Hˆ(t) = Hˆ and denote by.|E, k⟩the set of its eigenkets 
with eigenvalue. E: 
.Hˆ |E, k⟩ = E|E, k⟩. (1.144) 
In general, there can exist multiple eigenkets with the same eigenvalue, and conse￾quently, there can be multiple values for the index . k. Let’s delve deeper into this 
point. As a consequence of what has been mentioned below Eq. (1.135), if a sys￾tem has.M degrees of freedom, we can always find.M − 1 observables. Oˆ 2,..., Oˆ M
such that the.M observables.Hˆ , Oˆ 2,..., Oˆ M are all independent and mutually com￾muting. For instance, consider a free particle (thus potential energy .V = 0) with 
mass .m in three dimensions, so that .Hˆ = pˆ2
2m with .pˆ2 ≡ ˆp2
x + ˆp2
y + ˆp2
z . A possible 
choice for the observables.Oˆ 2, Oˆ 3 could be.pˆ y and. pˆz; indeed, the three observables 
.Hˆ , pˆ y , pˆz are mutually independent and commuting. Of course, the observable . pˆx
also commutes with . Hˆ , so we could equivalently choose the set .Hˆ , pˆx , pˆz or the 
set .Hˆ , pˆ y , pˆx . However, it’s not possible to have more than three observables with 
the desired characteristics. For example, the four observables.Hˆ , pˆx , pˆ y , pˆz, despite 
all commuting with each other, are not mutually independent as we can express 
.Hˆ in terms of .pˆx , pˆ y , pˆz. Let’s return to the general case. Since the observables 
.Hˆ , Oˆ 2,..., Oˆ M commute with each other, there must exist a common basis of eigen￾kets. Denote by.|E O2 ... OM ⟩the general common eigenket of.Hˆ , Oˆ 2,..., Oˆ M with 
eigenvalues .E, O2,..., OM . By virtue of the collapse postulate, we can also give 
a physical interpretation to this ket:.|E O2 ... OM ⟩ describes the state of the system1.7 Generalization of the Fifth Postulate: Schrödinger Equation 33
when a simultaneous measurement of the observables .Hˆ , Oˆ 2,..., Oˆ M yields the 
values.E, O2,..., OM . It’s evident that as.O2,..., OM vary, the ket. |E O2 ... OM ⟩
remains an eigenket of.Hˆ with eigenvalue. E. In this case, the index. k in Eq. (1.144) 
is a composite index: .k = (O2,..., OM ). In the previous example of a particle in 
three dimensions, the eigenvalues of .Hˆ are .E = p2
x + p2
y + p2
z and if we were to 
choose the observables.Oˆ 2, Oˆ 3 as.pˆ y and. pˆz, we can observe that as the eigenvalues 
.py and.pz change, the ket.|Epy pz⟩ remains an eigenket of.Hˆ with eigenvalue. E. 
We say that the eigenvalue .E is degenerate, and the degeneracy corresponds to 
the number of independent eigenstates having that eigenvalue. The state (or states in 
the case of a degeneracy greater than one) corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue is 
called the ground state. All other states are referred to as excited states. The set of 
eigenvalues of an observable is also known as the spectrum. The spectrum of.Hˆ can 
be discrete, continuous, or it can have both a discrete and a continuous part. The type 
of spectrum depends on the system. For simplicity, in what follows, we assume that 
the spectrum of.Hˆ is discrete. The continuous case doesn’t introduce any additional 
difficulties; the only difference is that sums become integrals, and Kronecker deltas 
become Dirac deltas. We have the opportunity to explore this more thoroughly later 
on. 
Just as the set of kets.|q1 ... qM ⟩ or.|p1 ... pM ⟩ forms an orthonormal basis for the 
Hilbert space . H, the set of kets .|E, k⟩ also forms, according to the third postulate, 
an orthonormal basis for the same Hilbert space. We have 
.⟨E, k|E'
, k'
⟩ = δE,E'δkk' (1.145) 
which implies 
.
∑
E,k
|E, k⟩⟨E, k| = 1. (1.146) 
Let us expand.|ψ(t)⟩ on the eigenkets of. Hˆ
.|ψ(t)⟩ = ∑
E,k
cE,k (t)|E, k⟩. (1.147) 
Given the orthonormality of the basis, the coefficients are given by . cE,k (t) =
⟨E, k|ψ(t)⟩. Therefore, according to the fourth postulate, their squared modulus 
correspond to the probability of measuring energy .E at time . t. Obviously, if for a 
certain energy, the index. k can take multiple values, the probability of measuring. E
is the sum of these probabilities:.P(E) = ∑
k |cE,k (t)|
2. It’s straightforward to ver￾ify that.|ψ(t)⟩ satisfies the Schrödinger equation if the coefficients of the expansion 
depend on time in the following way: 
.cE,k (t) = cE,k (0)e−i Et
 . (1.148)34 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
Indeed 
.i d
dt |ψ(t)⟩ = ∑
E,k
cE,k (0)e−i Et
 E|E, k⟩ (1.149) 
and 
.Hˆ |ψ(t)⟩ = ∑
E,k
cE,k (t)Hˆ |E, k⟩ = ∑
E,k
cE,k (0)e−i Et
 E|E, k⟩. (1.150) 
Therefore, the probability of measuring a certain energy is independent of time since 
.|cE,k (t)|
2 = |cE,k (0)|
2. The case of the H. 
+
2 ion analyzed in Sect. 1.2 is a very special 
case of the general theory just formulated. By using the experimental data that there 
was a non-zero probability only to measure the two lowest energies of . Hˆ , we can 
set all the coefficients.cE,k (t) to zero except for those associated with the two lowest 
energies. This way, we recover the expansion in Eq. (1.21) and recognize the solution 
in Eq. (1.25) as a particular case of Eq. (1.148). 
Now, let’s consider another generic observable.Oˆ with eigenvalues.O and eigen￾states.|O,i⟩ (these eigenstates also form an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space 
. H, the index. i accounts for the degeneracy of the eigenvalue. O). The probability of 
measuring.O at time. t is given by: 
.P(O) = ∑

(1.151) 
and, in general, it depends on time. Returning once again to the example of the H. 
+
2
ion, if .|O,i⟩=|R1⟩ is the (only) eigenstate that describes the electron in .R1 and 
if the only non-zero coefficients are .ca(0) = cb(0) = 1/
√2, then .P(R1) coincides 
with Eq. (1.33). 
The formal solution of the Schrödinger equation for a time-independent Hamil￾tonian can also be written as: 
. |ψ(t)⟩ = e−i Ht ˆ
 |ψ(0)⟩ (1.152) 
as can be immediately seen by taking the derivative with respect to time. Therefore, 
we can also write Eq. (1.151) as: 
.P(O) = ∑
i
|⟨O,i|e−i Ht ˆ
 |ψ(0)⟩|2
. (1.153) 
It’s straightforward to verify that this expression coincides with Eq. (1.151) by 
expanding.|ψ(0)⟩ as in Eq. (1.147). Two observations: 
1. If .Oˆ commutes with . Hˆ , then we can choose its eigenstates to also be eigen￾states of. Hˆ . Denoting the energy of the state.|O,i⟩ as.Ei , we have. ⟨O,i|e−i Ht ˆ
 =
⟨O,i|e−i
Ei t
 , and thus the probability.P(O) does not depend on time.1.7 Generalization of the Fifth Postulate: Schrödinger Equation 35
2. If the state .|ψ0⟩ is an eigenstate of .Hˆ with eigenvalue . E, then . e−i Ht ˆ
 |ψ0⟩ =
e−i Et
 |ψ0⟩, and therefore, even in this case, the probability.P(O) does not depend 
on time. This property holds for all eigenvalues of the operator. Oˆ, and thus even 
the expectation value of the operator, defined in Eq. (1.34), does not depend on 
time. 
We conclude this section with a generalization of the solution to the Schrödinger 
equation for piecewise constant Hamiltonians. Suppose that at time.t = t0 the system 
is described by the ket.|ψ(t0)⟩, and the Hamiltonian.Hˆ(t) = Hˆ0 for all times. t in the 
interval from. t0 to another time.t1 > t0. Then, if.t ∈ (t0, t1), the Schrödinger equation 
in Eq. (1.142) can be written as: 
.i d
dt |ψ(t)⟩ = Hˆ0|ψ(t)⟩ (1.154) 
which solved by 
.|ψ(t)⟩ = e−i
Hˆ
0(t−t
0)
 |ψ(t0)⟩, t ∈ (t0, t1). (1.155) 
Indeed, for.t = t0 the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side. Furthermore, if we 
take the derivative with respect to time, we find precisely Eq. (1.154). It is important 
to emphasize that Eq. (1.155) represents the state at time. t only if.t ∈ (t0, t1), given 
that only within this time interval is the Hamiltonian given by the operator.Hˆ0. Let us 
now suppose that at time . t1, the Hamiltonian suddenly changes from .Hˆ0 to another 
operator.Hˆ1, and it remains constant until time.t2 > t1. Then, within the time interval 
.(t1, t2), the Schrödinger equation in Eq. (1.142) can be written as: 
.i d
dt |ψ(t)⟩ = Hˆ1|ψ(t)⟩ (1.156) 
which is solved by 
.|ψ(t)⟩ = e−i
Hˆ
1(t−t

 |ψ(t1)⟩, t ∈ (t1, t2). (1.157) 
Indeed, for.t = t1 the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side. Furthermore, if we 
take the derivative with respect to time, we find precisely Eq. (1.156). Once again, let 
us emphasize that Eq. (1.157) represents the state at time. t only if.t ∈ (t1, t2), given 
that only within this time interval is the Hamiltonian given by the operator.Hˆ1. Now, 
the ket.|ψ(t1)⟩ can be calculated from Eq. (1.155) by setting.t = t1, and thus we can 
rewrite Eq. (1.157) as: 
.|ψ(t)⟩ = e−i

This procedure can be iterated once again, of course. If at time . t2 the Hamiltonian 
suddenly changes from .Hˆ1 to another operator .Hˆ2 and remains constant until time36 1 The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
.t3 > t2, then within the time interval.(t2, t3), the Schrödinger equation in Eq. (1.142) 
can be written as: 
.i d
dt |ψ(t)⟩ = Hˆ2|ψ(t)⟩ (1.159) 
which is solved by 
.|ψ(t)⟩ = e−i
Hˆ
2(t−t

 |ψ(t2)⟩, t ∈ (t2, t3). (1.160) 
The ket.|ψ(t2)⟩ can be computed from Eq. (1.158) by substituting.t = t2. This yields:

At this point, it should be clear how to write the general solution in case the Hamil￾tonian continues to change in the subsequent time intervals. 
1.8 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle 
In Sect. 1.1, we have observed that having a precise knowledge of the position of the 
electron in the H. 
+
2 ion leads to an uncertainty in the value of energy (and therefore 
momentum), and similarly, having a precise knowledge of the energy leads to an 
uncertainty in the value of position. In this section, we aim to demonstrate that these 
empirical observations are rooted in the fact that the position operator . xˆ and the 
momentum operator. pˆ do not commute with each other. 
Let us begin by recalling the Schwarz inequality. Consider two kets, .|A⟩ and 
.|B⟩, belonging to a certain Hilbert space. H. Then: 
. ⟨A|A⟩⟨B|B⟩ ≥ |⟨A|B⟩|2 (1.162) 
The proof is straightforward. Given the property of the scalar product: 
.
(
⟨A| + λ∗⟨B|
)
(|A⟩ + λ|B⟩) ≥ 0, ∀λ. (1.163) 
Setting.λ = −⟨B|A⟩/⟨B|B⟩ the Schwarz inequality is recovered. 
Now, let’s suppose that our system is described by a normalized ket.|ψ⟩, meaning 
.⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1. The expectation value of two general observables,.Oˆ 1 and.Oˆ 2, is given 
by, as seen in Eq. (1.34),.⟨Oˆ ξ ⟩=⟨ψ|Oˆ ξ |ψ⟩, where.ξ = 1, 2. Let’s construct two new 
observables: 
.σˆ Oξ ≡ Oˆ ξ − ⟨Oˆ ξ ⟩, ξ = 1, 2. (1.164)1.8 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle 37
The expectation value of their square is given by: 
.⟨ ˆσ2
Oξ
⟩=⟨Oˆ 2
ξ − 2Oˆ ξ ⟨Oˆ ξ ⟩+⟨Oˆ ξ ⟩
2
⟩=⟨Oˆ 2
ξ ⟩−⟨Oˆ ξ ⟩
2 (1.165) 
and it coincides precisely with the square of the variance defined in Eq. (1.35). 
The variance provides an indication of how uncertain the measured value is. Let’s 
assume that the system’s state is described by the ket .|ψ⟩=|O1⟩, meaning it is 
an eigenket of the operator .Oˆ 1 with eigenvalue .O1. In this case, the probability of 
measuring .O1 is equal to one, and the probability of measuring any other value . O'
1
is zero. In other words, there is no uncertainty about the measurement outcome. It 
is then immediately evident that if.|ψ⟩=|O1⟩, the variance.⟨ ˆσ2
O1
⟩ is zero. Thus, the 
more certain the measurement value, the smaller the variance; conversely, the more 
uncertain the value, the larger the variance. 
We define the kets 
.|A⟩= ˆσO1 |ψ⟩, |B⟩= ˆσO2 |ψ⟩. (1.166) 
From the Schwarz inequality, we find: 
.⟨ ˆσ2

⟩ ≥ |
|⟨ ˆσO1σˆ O2 ⟩

. (1.167) 
Let’s express the product of operators .σˆ O1σˆ O2 as the sum of a Hermitian operator 
and an anti-Hermitian operator: 
.σˆ O1σˆ O2 = 1
2
[
σˆ O1 , σˆ O2
]

σˆ O1 , σˆ O2
 
. (1.168) 
The first term is a commutator and therefore anti-Hermitian 
.[ ˆσO1 , σˆ O2 ]
† = (
σˆ O1σˆ O2 − ˆσO2σˆ O1
)† = −[ ˆσO1 , σˆ O2 ]. (1.169) 
The second term is an anticommutator and therefore Hermitian 
.{ ˆσO1 , σˆ O2 }
† = (
σˆ O1σˆ O2 + ˆσO2σˆ O1
)† = {ˆσO1 , σˆ O2 }. (1.170) 
Using the fact that the expectation value of a Hermitian operator is real, while the 
expectation value of an anti-Hermitian operator is purely imaginary, we can rewrite 
Eq. (1.167) as: 
. ⟨ ˆσ2

(1.172) 
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle translates into mathematical language the 
fact that if two observables do not commute, then the product of their variances can￾not be arbitrarily small, or equivalently, it is not possible to reduce the uncertainty 
of both measurements simultaneously without limit. Let’s consider the case of oper￾ators .Oˆ 1 = ˆx and .Oˆ 2 = ˆp. In this case, the commutator .[ ˆx, pˆ] = i , and thus the 
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle establishes that 
. ⟨ ˆσ2
x ⟩⟨ ˆσ2
p⟩ ≥
 2
4 (1.173) 
So, if we are certain about the position, and thus.⟨ ˆσ2
x ⟩ = 0, the uncertainty in momen￾tum is maximum, .⟨ ˆσ2
p⟩→∞. Conversely, if we are certain about the momentum, 
and thus.⟨ ˆσ2
p⟩ = 0, the uncertainty in position is maximum,.⟨ ˆσ2
x ⟩→∞. In the limit 
as. → 0, we recover the classical result that both can be known with certainty. 
In light of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we can also understand why the 
lowest measurable energy value for the electron in the H. 
+
2 ion is greater than the 
classical minimum value, as discussed in Sect. 1.1. The classical minimum value is 
obtained by placing the electron precisely at the bottom of one of the two potential 
wells with zero momentum. However, quantum mechanically, this situation is impos￾sible since it would imply having absolute certainty in both position and momentum. 
For such a state, the variances of . x and .p would be zero, which contradicts the 
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. 
1.9 Summary of What We Have Learned So Far 
With the previous section, we conclude the first part of the course. Let’s briefly 
summarize the main concepts we have learned so far: 
(1) A system with .M degrees of freedom is described by the ket .|q1 ... qM ⟩ if 
a simultaneous measurement of these degrees of freedom provides the values 
.q1 ... qM (collapse postulate). 
(2) The set of kets.|q1 ... qM ⟩ forms an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space. H. 
(3) The most general state .|ψ⟩ that the system can be in is described by a ket 
belonging to. H. 
(4) For every observable, there is an associated Hermitian operator, and the possible 
outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that operator.1.10 Exercises 39
(5) The operators .qˆα associated with the degrees of freedom and the operators 
.pˆα associated with their conjugate momenta satisfy the commutation rules 
.[ ˆqα, pˆβ] = i δαβ and .[ ˆqα, qˆβ]=[ˆpα, pˆβ] = 0 (Dirac’s postulate), from which 
it is possible to compute scalar products.⟨p1 ... pM |q1 ... qM ⟩. 
(6) Given .M independent observables .Oˆi = Oi({ ˆq},{ ˆp}) that mutually commute, 
and each with eigenvalues .Oi , the ket .|O1 ... OM ⟩ describes the system’s 
state when a simultaneous measurement of these observables yields the val￾ues.O1,... OM . Furthermore, the set of kets.|O1 ... OM ⟩ forms an orthonormal 
basis of. H. 
(7) If the system is described by the ket .|ψ⟩, then the probability of measuring 
.O1,..., OM for the observables .Oˆi is given by . P(O1,..., OM ) =
|⟨O1 ... OM |ψ⟩|2, see Eq. (1.131). 
(8) The temporal evolution of the ket that describes the system is governed by the 
Schrödinger equation .i d
dt |ψ(t)⟩ = Hˆ(t)|ψ(t)⟩, where . Hˆ(t) = H({ ˆq},{ ˆp}, t)
and.H is the Hamiltonian. 
In the remaining part of the book, we apply these principles to simple systems 
and highlight the differences between the quantum and classical descriptions.

. Bˆ Aˆ = −i|v1⟩⟨v1| − i|v1⟩⟨v3| + i|v3⟩⟨v1| + i|v3⟩⟨v3|
Therefore.[Aˆ, Bˆ] = 2i|v1⟩⟨v1| − 2i|v3⟩⟨v3|. 
ii. To calculate the variance we need to calculate the square of the operators. 
We have 
. Aˆ2 = |v1⟩⟨v1| + 2|v2⟩⟨v2|+|v3⟩⟨v3|+|v1⟩⟨v3|+|v3⟩⟨v1|
. Bˆ 2 = |v1⟩⟨v1| + 2|v2⟩⟨v2|+|v3⟩⟨v3|−|v1⟩⟨v3|−|v3⟩⟨v1|

that. Sˆ is Hermitian. 
iv. We have.Eˆ = Cˆ + iSˆ = cos(1)1ˆ + i sin(1)Aˆ. We also have. Eˆ † = cos(1)1ˆ −

Quantum Systems in Finite-Dimensional 
Hilbert Spaces 
It is much more common than one might imagine that, for a given problem concerning 
a system with.M degrees of freedom, the number of quantum states to consider is not 
the entire set.|q1 ... qM ⟩, but only a finite number of states.|ϕk ⟩ (each of which can 
obviously be expressed as a linear combination of the kets.|q1 ... qM ⟩). For example, 
in the case of an electron in the H. 
+
2 ion, the Hilbert space of the electron is given 
by the set of eigenkets.|x⟩ of the position operator. However, at zero temperature, a 
good description can be obtained by considering only the kets .|R1⟩ and .|R2⟩. The 
choice of the set of kets .|ϕk ⟩ is generally dictated by the system, the problem, and 
especially our physical intuition. In this chapter, we do not discuss how to choose 
the kets .|ϕk ⟩. Instead, we assume that someone else has done it for us and we here 
show how to simplify the equations of the previous chapter. 
2.1 From Operators to Matrices, from Kets to Column 
Vectors, from Bras to Row Vectors 
Let’s assume that the system can only be in a finite number of quantum states.|ϕk ⟩, 
where.k = 1,..., N. Without loss of generality, we also assume that these states are 
orthonormal to each other 
.⟨ϕk |ϕk/⟩ = δkk/. (2.1) 
If they are not orthonormal, we can indeed orthogonalize them using, for example, 
the Gram-Schmidt procedure. The set of these kets forms an orthonormal basis for 
a Hilbert space .H/
. From the original Hilbert space . H, we are then considering a 
subspace.H/ ⊂ H. The most general ket in.H/ can be written as follows: 
.|ψ⟩ = ∑
N
k=1
ψk |ϕk ⟩, ψk = ⟨ϕk |ψ⟩. (2.2)

4748 2 Quantum Systems in Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
From now on, unless specified otherwise, sums are always understood to range from 
1 to .N. A generic operator . Oˆ, defined in . H, when acting on .|ψ⟩ ∈ H/ ⊂ H may 
not necessarily generate a ket within.H/
. However, we are not interested in a generic 
operator. Our working assumptions only make sense for a given system and a specific 
problem. Therefore, we are interested in operators for which the components of. Oˆ|ψ⟩
outside of.H/ are very small, approaching negligibility in the limit. In such a case, 
.Oˆ|ψ⟩ = ∑
k
ψk Oˆ|ϕk ⟩ ∈ H/ (2.3) 
Of course, for this to happen independently of the coefficients .ψk , it is necessary 
that.Oˆ|ϕk ⟩ ∈ H/ for all. k. Knowing the action of.Oˆ on all the kets of the basis allows 
us to calculate the action of .Oˆ on a generic ket. What information do we need to 
determine the action of.Oˆ on the various.|ϕk ⟩? Considering that in.H/
, the resolution 
of the identity is written as follows 
.
∑
k
|ϕk ⟩⟨ϕk | = 1, (2.4) 
we have 
.Oˆ|ϕk ⟩ = ∑
k/
|ϕk/⟩⟨ϕk/|Oˆ|ϕk ⟩ = ∑
k/
Ok/
k |ϕk/⟩. (2.5) 
Therefore, knowledge of the matrix .O with elements .Ok/
k ≡ ⟨ϕk/|Oˆ|ϕk ⟩ is all that 
is needed. The matrix.O is called the representation of the operator.Oˆ in the basis 
of .|ϕk ⟩. Clearly, the matrix changes if we change the basis. However, since .Oˆ is a 
Hermitian operator, i.e.,.Oˆ † = Oˆ, the matrix.O is Hermitian regardless of the basis. 
In fact, 
.O∗
kk/ = ⟨ϕk |Oˆ|ϕk/⟩
∗ = ⟨ϕk/|Oˆ †
|ϕk ⟩=⟨ϕk/|Oˆ|ϕk ⟩ = Ok/
k . (2.6) 
Inserting Eq. (2.5) in Eq. (2.3) we find 
.Oˆ|ψ⟩ = ∑
kk/
Ok/
kψk |ϕk/⟩. (2.7) 
So the ket .|Φ⟩ ≡ Oˆ|ψ⟩ is also a linear combination of the .|ϕk ⟩, as it should be. 
Let’s define the vector .ψ with components .ψk and the vector .Φ with components 
.Φk = ⟨ϕk |Φ⟩. From now on, we use bold letters (both Greek and Latin) to represent 
vectors. These vectors are the representation of the kets .|ψ⟩ and .|Φ⟩ in the basis 
of.|ϕk ⟩. Clearly, the vectors change if we change the basis. Note that for a quantum 
system describing a particle in one dimension, as discussed in Sect. 1.4, the eigenkets 
.|x⟩ of the position operator form a basis of the Hilbert space. If we do not truncate 
the Hilbert space, i.e., if we take all .|x⟩, then the representation of the ket .|ψ⟩ in 
the basis of .|x⟩ is an infinite-dimensional vector with components .ψ(x) = ⟨x|ψ⟩.2.1 From Operators to Matrices, from Kets to Column Vectors … 49
In other words, the wave function is nothing but the representation of a ket in the 
position basis. But let’s get back to our discussion. We have 
.|Φ⟩ = ∑
k/
|ϕk/⟩⟨ϕk/|Φ⟩ = ∑
k/
Φk/|ϕk/⟩ = ∑
kk/
Ok/
kψk |ϕk/⟩ (2.8) 
From which it follows that, due to the linear independence of the kets .|ϕk ⟩, . Φk
∑ / =
k Ok/
kψk . Therefore, the.k/
-th component of the vector. Φ is obtained by taking the 
dot product between the.k/
-th row of the matrix.O and the vector. ψ. But this means 
that 
. Φ = Oψ (2.9) 
In other words, the vector . Φ, representing .|Φ⟩ = Oˆ|ψ⟩ in the basis .|ϕk ⟩, is the 
product of the matrix representing .Oˆ and the vector representing .|ψ⟩ in the same 
basis. 
With these premises, we can easily calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues 
of the Hamiltonian in the space .H/
. Let’s suppose we need to solve the problem 
.Hˆ |E⟩ = E|E⟩. Based on what we have just learned, the vector representing . Hˆ |E⟩
can be written as .HE, where .H is the matrix representing .Hˆ and .E is the vector 
representing.|E⟩. So, 
.Hˆ |E⟩ = E|E⟩ ⇒ HE = EE (2.10) 
Let’s denote by.E(n) the eigenvalues of. H and by.E(n) its eigenvectors. Since. H is an 
.N × N matrix, we have. N eigenvalues (not necessarily all distinct from each other) 
and. N eigenvectors: 
.HE(n) = E(n)
E(n)
, n = 1,..., N (2.11) 
The eigenkets.|E(n)
⟩ are simply given by 
.|E(n)
⟩ = ∑
k
E(n)
k |ϕk ⟩ (2.12) 
where.E(n)
k is the. kth component of the vector.E(n)
. 
Representing operators and kets in a certain basis can be very convenient for car￾rying out calculations. Often in quantum mechanics problems, the physical meaning 
of the basis.|ϕk ⟩ is omitted, and representations of operators or kets in a specific basis 
are written directly. As we have seen, once the basis is fixed, we can easily convert 
equations written in terms of matrices and vectors into equations written in terms of 
operators and kets. Conversely, an equation written in terms of operators and kets 
can be easily converted into an equation for matrices and vectors. But what do we do 
when we have an equation that contains the product of multiple operators? Or when 
the equation involves bras?50 2 Quantum Systems in Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Consider the product operator.Cˆ = Aˆ Bˆ. Its representation. C has matrix elements 
. Ckk/ = ⟨ϕk |Cˆ|ϕk/⟩=⟨ϕk |Aˆ Bˆ|ϕk/⟩ = ∑
p
⟨ϕk |Aˆ|ϕp⟩⟨ϕp|Bˆ|ϕk/⟩ = ∑
p
AkpBpk .
(2.13) 
So the matrix. C is simply the product of the matrix. A and the matrix. B
. C = AB (2.14) 
More generally, if we have a function of operators .F(Aˆ, Bˆ,Cˆ, . . .) = Fˆ, its repre￾sentation is simply given by the function of matrices 
. F = F(A,B, C, . . .) (2.15) 
Suppose instead we need to calculate the action of an operator on a bra,.⟨ψ|Oˆ = ⟨Φ|. 
Multiplying the equation by the ket.|ϕk ⟩, we find 
.⟨ψ|Oˆ|ϕk ⟩ = ∑
k/
⟨ψ|ϕk/⟩⟨ϕk/|Oˆ|ϕk ⟩=⟨Φ|ϕk ⟩. (2.16) 
Now, .⟨ψ|ϕk/⟩=⟨ϕk/|ψ⟩∗ = ψ∗
k/ and .⟨Φ|ϕk ⟩=⟨ϕk |Φ⟩∗ = Φ∗
k . So, the equation 
above can also be written as.
∑
k/ ψ∗
k/ Ok/
k = Φ∗
k . On the left-hand side of the equation, 
we recognize the dot product between a row vector with components .ψ∗
k/ and the 
column vector formed by column. k of the matrix. O. Since this relation must hold for 
every. k, it follows that 
.⟨ψ|Oˆ = ⟨Φ| ⇒ ψ†
O = Φ† (2.17) 
So, the representation of the bra.⟨ψ| is the dagger (conjugate transpose) of the vector 
representing the ket.|ψ⟩. 
In conclusion, the representation of an equation written in terms of bras, operators, 
and kets can be obtained by replacing bras with their representation in terms of row 
vectors, operators with their representation in terms of matrices, and kets with their 
representation in terms of column vectors. 
2.2 Quantum Systems with Two States—Pauli Matrices 
The simplest quantum system is the one for which it is possible to solve a given 
problem using only two kets, as in the example of the electron in the H. 
+
2 ion. In this 
case, all observables are represented by Hermitian.2 × 2 matrices. The most general 
Hermitian.2 × 2 matrix can be written as2.2 Quantum Systems with Two States—Pauli Matrices 51
Fig. 2.1 Polar 
representation of a unit 
vector 
.O =
( a0 + a3 a1 − ia2
a1 + ia2 a0 − a3
)
(2.18) 
where the constants .a0, a1, a2, a3 are all real. It is easy to verify that regardless of 
the values of these constants,.O = O†. Introducing the Pauli matrices 
.σ1 =
(0 1

, σ2 =
(0 −i

, (2.19) 
we can rewrite.O as 
.O = a011 + a1σ1 + a2σ2 + a3σ3 = a011 + a · σ (2.20) 
where. 11 is the.2 × 2 identity matrix,. a is the vector with components.(a1, a2, a3), and 
. σ is the vector of Hermitian matrices.(σ1, σ2, σ3). Let’s further manipulate Eq. (2.20). 
Let 
.a =
/
a2
1 + a2
2 + a2
3 (2.21) 
the magnitude of the vector . a. The vector .n = a/a is then a unit vector with a 
magnitude of. 1, as shown in Fig. 2.1, and as such, it can always be written as 
.n =
⎛
⎝
a1/a

⎞
⎠ =
⎛
⎝
sin θ cos ϕ
sin θ sin ϕ

⎞
⎠ (2.22)52 2 Quantum Systems in Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
The angles. θ and. φ can be expressed in terms of.a1, a2, a3 by equating the com￾ponents. For example, from the last component, we obtain that .θ = arccos(a3/a), 
while from the ratio between the second and first component, we obtain that 
.φ = arctan(a2/a1). Using the expression of . n in terms of the angles . θ and . φ, the 
matrix.O can be rewritten as: 
. O = a011 + an · σ (2.23) 
where 
. n · σ =
( cos θ sin θe−iϕ
sin θeiϕ − cos θ
)
(2.24) 
Now let’s study the matrix.n · σ. The eigenvalues of.n · σ are.λ+ = 1 and. λ− =
−1, and by using the trigonometric formulas 
. cos(α − β) = cos α cos β + sin α sin β
sin(α − β) = sin α cos β − cos α sin β (2.25) 
it is straightforward to verify that the eigenvectors associated with them are 
. ψ+ =
(e−iϕ/2 cos(θ/2)
eiϕ/2 sin(θ/2)
)
, ψ− =
(−e−iϕ/2 sin(θ/2)
eiϕ/2 cos(θ/2)
)
(2.26) 
The vectors.ψ+ and.ψ− are correctly orthogonal as they are associated with distinct 
eigenvalues of the same Hermitian operator.n · σ. In particular, both.ψ+ and.ψ− are 
normalized to 1, forming an orthonormal basis. Therefore, the kets associated with 
them,.|ψ±⟩, can be used to write the resolution of the identity as follows: 
.11ˆ = |ψ+⟩⟨ψ+|+|ψ−⟩⟨ψ−| (2.27) 
and based on what we have learned in the previous section, the representation of this 
equation is 
.11 = ψ+ψ†
+ + ψ−ψ†
− (2.28) 
since the representation of. 11ˆ is precisely the identity matrix. 11. Let’s emphasize that 
the vectors.ψ+ and.ψ− are two-component vectors as they are eigenvectors of. 2 × 2
matrices. They should be kept distinct from vectors like . a or . n which have three 
components and are used to represent the matrix. O. 
The eigenvalue equation .(n · σ)ψ± = ±ψ± implies that .a(n · σ)ψ± = ±aψ±. 
Therefore 
. O ψ± = a011ψ± + a(n · σ)ψ± = (a0 ± a)ψ± (2.29)2.2 Quantum Systems with Two States—Pauli Matrices 53
It follows that the vectors .ψ+ and .ψ− are also eigenvectors of the matrix .O with 
eigenvalues .(a0 + a) and .(a0 − a). Furthermore, for any generic matrix function 
.F(O), we have 
. F(O) ψ± = F(a0 ± a)ψ± (2.30) 
Particularly interesting is the evaluation of the unitary matrix.eiO. In fact, in the case 
where.O = −Ht/ , with.H being the Hamiltonian, the matrix in question becomes 
.e−iHt/ , and as we know, this matrix allows us to determine the temporal evolution. 
Using Eq. (2.28) and Eq. (2.30), we have 
.eiO = eiO11 = eiO (

Let us perform this calculation. We have

The Hamiltonian all has equal rows, so we have four zero eigenvalues and one 
non-zero eigenvalue. The latter must necessarily be . E0 whose eigenvector we 
have established previously to be. Φ. It follows that the probability of measuring

Therefore the probability of measuring energy .E = 0 is equal to.4/5. 
9. A two-level quantum system is described by a Hamiltonian.Hˆ that, in a certain 
orthonormal basis, is represented by the matrix. H. Determine the matrix. H given 
that: 
(1) The sum of its eigenvalues is zero, and the energy of the ground state is 
greater than.−2E0, where.E0 > 0; 
(2).H commutes with the Pauli matrix.σy ; 
(3) The average of.H over the state described by the vector. √

is positive. 
(4) If at time.t = 0 the system is in the state described by the vector. v, following 
the temporal evolution, the state returns to itself at time.t = 3 /E0. 
Solution The most general matrix representation we can write is a combina￾tion of the.2 × 2 identity matrix and the three Pauli matrices. From information 
(1), we deduce that the coefficient of the identity matrix must be zero. From 
information (2), it must be the case that .H = γσy with. γ real. The eigenvalues 
of .H are then .ϵ± = ±γ, with corresponding eigenvectors.ψ+ = √

and 
.ψ− = √

. From information (3), we deduce that .γ > 0.62 2 Quantum Systems in Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Let us now use information (4). The vector . v can be written as. v = α+ψ+ +
α−ψ−. Therefore, the temporal evolution of the state vector is 
. v(t) = α+e−iϵ+t/ ψ+ + α−e−iϵ−t/ ψ−
= α+e−iγt/ ψ+ + α−eiγt/ ψ−
= e−iγt/ [
α+ψ+ + α−e2iγt/ ψ−
]
. (2.45) 
Therefore, at time.t = 3 /E0, the vector.v(3 /E0) is (up to an irrelevant phase 
factor) identical to. v if .6γ = 2nπE0, where. n is a positive integer. Remembering 
that the energy of the ground state must be greater than .−2E0, it follows that 
.γ = πE0/3. In conclusion,.H = πE0

.a + b = 3, while from information (2) we immediately find that .a = 2, from 
which.b = 1 follows. The eigenvalues of the matrix.H =

are. λ± =

3.1 Momentum Operator and Hamiltonian

a momentum eigenket.|p⟩ is given by Eq. (1.128): 
.⟨x|p⟩ =

⟨x|p⟩ = p⟨x|p⟩ (3.2) 
Now, let’s consider a general ket.|ψ⟩ describing our particle in one dimension, and 
learn how to calculate .⟨x| ˆp|ψ⟩, where . pˆ is the momentum operator with eigenkets 
.|p⟩ having eigenvalue. p. By inserting the resolution of the identity

With these premises, we can tackle many problems in one dimension. If the particle 
is subject to a potential.V(x) that depends only on position, then its Lagrangian is 
.L = 1
2
mx˙2 − V(x). (3.6) 
The conjugate momentum is then 
.p = ∂L
∂x˙ = mx˙ (3.7) 
from which we find .x˙ = p/m. This allows us to obtain the Hamiltonian from the 
Legendre transform 
.H = px˙ − L = p2
2m + V(x). (3.8) 
Therefore, the Schrödinger equation for a particle in one dimension subjected to the 
potential.V(x) is written as follows 
.i ∂

|ψ(t)⟩ = Hˆ |ψ(t)⟩ = ( pˆ2
2m + V(xˆ)

|ψ(t)⟩. (3.9) 
In Eq. (3.9), the unknown object to determine is the ket .|ψ(t)⟩. To find it, it 
is often useful to transform the equation into an equation for the wave function 
.ψ(x, t) = ⟨x|ψ(t)⟩. Clearly, knowing the wave function is equivalent to knowing 
the ket, as.|ψ(t)⟩ = ʃ dxψ(x, t)|x⟩. Multiplying Eq. (3.9) by the bra.⟨x| we obtain

ψ(x, t) =

ψ(x, t) (3.10) 
where we use Eq. (3.4) and the fact that.⟨x|V (xˆ) = ⟨x|V(x).3.1 Momentum Operator and Hamiltonian 69
A common way to proceed at this point is to find the eigenfunctions . ψE,k (x) =
⟨x|E, k⟩ of the Hamiltonian: 
. (

)
|E, k⟩ = E|E, k⟩ ⇒ (

∂x2 + V(x)
)
ϕE,k (x) = EϕE,k (x).
(3.11) 
Indeed, the set of kets .|E, k⟩ forms a basis, and therefore, we can always expand 
.|ψ(t)⟩ on this basis. As seen in Sect. 1.7, the solution is given by 
. |ψ(t)⟩ = ∑
E,k
cE,k (0)e−i Et
 |E, k⟩ ⇒ ψ(x, t) = ∑
E,k
cE,k (0)e−i Et
 ϕE,k (x)
(3.12) 
where.cE,k (0) = ⟨E, k|ψ(0)⟩. 
The possible eigenvalues. E of the Hamiltonian.Hˆ = pˆ2
2m + V(xˆ)satisfy an impor￾tant inequality. Let .Vmin = minx V(x) be the minimum value of the function .V(x). 
Then 
.E ≥ Vmin. (3.13) 
The proof of this inequality is straightforward. Let’s assume, for the sake of contra￾diction, that there exists an eigenket .|E0⟩ with energy .E0 < Vmin. Without loss of 
generality, we normalize the ket to. 1,.⟨E0|E0⟩ = 1. We would then have: 
. E0 = ⟨E0|Hˆ |E0⟩=⟨E0|

in contradiction with the original assumption. 
One last important observation. Not all functions that satisfy Eq. (3.11) belong to 
the Hilbert space generated by physical kets. The Hilbert space for the eigenfunctions 
of the Hamiltonian operator is the space of continuous functions such that 
. lim

So, if for a certain energy. E we find a function.ϕ(x)that satisfies Eq. (3.11) but.ϕ(x)is 
not continuous or does not satisfy the condition in Eq. (3.15), then this function does 
not belong to the Hilbert space and therefore cannot be considered an eigenfunction.70 3 Quantum Particle in One Dimension

. J (x, t) =

The physical meaning of this equation is clear. The probability of finding the particle 
between two points.xa and.xb is obtained by integrating.P(x, t) between.xa and. xb. 
When we do this, the continuity equation tells us that this probability varies with 
time as follows 
.

dx P(x, t) = J (xa, t) − J (xb, t). (3.22)3.2 Piecewise Constant Potential 71
So, if the current entering at .xa is not balanced by the current exiting at . xb, the 
probability changes over time. Note that if the wave function is purely real, the 
current density is zero. 
3.2 Piecewise Constant Potential 
An important class of potentials for which it is possible to find all eigenfunctions 
analytically is the so-called piecewise constant potentials. They are characterized by 
a certain number of points .x1 < x2 < ··· < xN where they are discontinuous and 
are otherwise constant between two consecutive discontinuity points. So, 
.V(x) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
V0 x < x1
Vj x j < x < x j+1, j = 1,..., N − 1
VN x > xN
(3.23) 
An example of a piecewise constant potential is illustrated in Fig. 3.1 where there 
are only two discontinuity points. We denote the region of the real axis where 
.V(x) = Vj as .Rj , where . j = 0,..., N. Thus, .R0 = (−∞, x1), .Rj = (x j, x j+1) if 
. j = 1,..., N − 1, and .RN = (xN ,∞). The set of all regions .Rj is obviously the 
real axis itself. 
In the case of a piecewise constant potential, the eigenvalue equation, see 
Eq. (3.11), can be decomposed into.N + 1 equations, one for each region.

We observe that the eigenvalue .E is the same in all regions. At this moment, we 
omit the index . k in the eigenfunction since we do not yet know the degeneracy of 
the eigenvalue . E. We reintroduce it later if the degeneracy turns out to be greater 
than one. Since .Vj is constant, i.e., independent of . x, the most general solution of 
Eq. (3.24) is 
. ϕE (x) =

where

We observe that if.E > Vj , then.qj is real, and therefore, in region.Rj , the function 
.ϕE (x) is a linear combination of two purely imaginary exponentials. Conversely, if 
.E ≤ Vj , then.qj = i
/2m
 2 (Vj − E) ≡ ik j is imaginary, and in region.Rj , the function 
.ϕE (x) is a linear combination of two purely real exponentials if .k j > 0, while it is 
a linear function of. x if.k j = 0. In this case, a distinction is necessary. Indeed, if the 
region in question is region.R0, then for.x ∈ R0, Eq. (3.25) implies 
.ϕE (x) =
 A0e−k0 x + B0ek0 x E < V0
A0 + B0x E = V0
, x ∈ R0. (3.27) 
If the constant .A0 (for .E < V0) or the constant .B0 (for .E = V0) were nonzero, the 
eigenfunction could not satisfy the property in Eq. (3.15) because for.x → −∞, the 
function .ϕE (x) diverges exponentially in the first case and linearly in the second 
case. Therefore, for the solution to belong to the Hilbert space, it is necessary to set 
.A0 = 0 if.E < V0 or.B0 = 0 if.E = V0: 
.ϕE (x) =
 B0ek0 x E < V0
A0 E = V0
, x ∈ R0. (3.28) 
Similarly, for.x ∈ RN , Eq. (3.25) implies 
.ϕE (x) =
 AN e−kN x + BN ekN x E < VN
AN + BN x E = VN
, x ∈ RN (3.29) 
and if the constant.BN were nonzero, the eigenfunction could not satisfy the property 
in Eq. (3.15) as it would diverge exponentially (if.E < VN ) or linearly (if.E = VN ) 
for.x → ∞. Therefore, for the solution to belong to the Hilbert space, it is necessary 
to set.BN = 0: 
.ϕE (x) =
 AN e−kN x E < VN
AN E = VN
, x ∈ RN . (3.30)3.2 Piecewise Constant Potential 73
The regions.Rj in which the energy is less than the potential are called classically 
forbidden regions because classically the particle cannot be found in these regions. 
In quantum mechanics, however, there is a non-zero probability, proportional to 
.|ϕE (x)|
2, of finding the particle there. Once again, we notice that the classical limit 
is recovered when. → 0. In this case, indeed,.k j → ∞, and therefore, the condition 
in Eq. (3.15) imposes.Aj = 0 if.x < 0 and.Bj = 0 if.x > 0. Furthermore, if.x < 0, we 
have.Bj ek j x → 0 as.k j → ∞, while for.x > 0, we have.Aj e−k j x → 0 as.k j → ∞. 
In these regions, therefore, the probability of finding the particle is zero in the. → 0
limit. 
As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, for .ϕE (x) to be a valid eigenfunction, in addition to 
satisfying the property in Eq. (3.15), it must also be a continuous function. The func￾tion.ϕE (x) in Eq. (3.25) is certainly continuous at all points except for the potential 
discontinuity points, namely,.x1,..., xN . To ensure that.ϕE (x) is also continuous at 
those points, one must choose the constants.Aj and.Bj in such a way that they satisfy 
. lim
ϵ→0
ϕE (x j + ϵ) = lim
ϵ→0
ϕE (x j − ϵ), ∀x j . (3.31) 
From the Schrödinger equation, we can also deduce a condition on the first derivative 
.ϕ'
E (x) = d
dx ϕE (x). Integrating Eq. (3.11) between.(x j − ϵ) and.(x j + ϵ), we find 
.ϕ'
E (x j + ϵ) − ϕ'
E (x j − ϵ) = −2m
 2
x j+ϵ ʃ
x j−ϵ
dx [E − V(x)]ϕE (x). (3.32) 
In the limit.ϵ → 0, the integral tends to zero because the integrand is finite for every 
. x, and the integration domain tends to zero. Therefore, not only must the function 
itself be continuous, but also its first derivative 
. lim
ϵ→0
ϕ'
E (x j + ϵ) = lim
ϵ→0
ϕ'
E (x j − ϵ), ∀x j . (3.33) 
Using the explicit form of .ϕE (x) in Eq. (3.25), the continuity conditions for the 
function and its derivative allow us to generate a linear and homogeneous system of 
.2N equations for the.N + 1 unknown constants.A0,..., AN and the.N + 1 unknown 
constants.B0,..., BN , for a total of.2N + 2 unknowns. The coefficients of this linear 
system depend on the energy.E through the various. qj , as seen in Eq. (3.26). 
Let’s recall that an eigenket, and therefore an eigenfunction, is defined up to a 
multiplicative constant. This simply means that if.ϕE is an eigenfunction with energy 
. E, then.CϕE is also an eigenfunction with energy. E for any complex number. C. Of 
course, in order to construct a basis, we should only consider linearly independent 
eigenfunctions. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assign a certain value 
to one of the constants .Aj or .Bj . One possible choice could be .AN = 1, but any 
other choice at this level is equally valid. Fixing this constant uniquely determines 
the norm of the eigenfunction. For our purposes, we will refer to this “fixing” as 
the condition on the norm. The condition on the norm is equivalent to adding74 3 Quantum Particle in One Dimension
an additional equation, thus transforming the original homogeneous system of . 2N
equations for .2N + 2 unknowns into a non-homogeneous system (the condition on 
the norm gives rise to a non-zero right-hand side) of .2N + 1 equations for . 2N + 2
unknowns. Let’s discuss the possible solutions. 
To be concrete, let’s consider the potential in Fig. 3.1. In this case, there are. N = 2
discontinuity points, and the value of the potential in region.RN = R2 is greater than 
the value of the potential in region.R0:.VN = V2 > V0. 
(1) If the energy.E > V2, then. E is also greater than.V0 since.V2 > V0. In this case, 
we have no constraints on the unknown constants because neither the condition 
in Eq. (3.28) nor the condition in Eq. (3.30) is satisfied. We have a total of 
.2N + 2 = 6 unknowns: .A0, B0, A1, B1, A2, B2, and .2N = 4 equations for the 
continuity of the eigenfunction and its derivative, plus the condition on the norm, 
for a total of.2N + 1 = 5 equations. Therefore, the problem admits two linearly 
independent solutions that define two independent eigenfunctions with energy 
. E: .ϕE,1 and .ϕE,2. In this case, the eigenvalue .E is doubly degenerate. One 
way to ensure that we find two orthonormal solutions, and therefore linearly 
independent ones, is to solve the problem by choosing, first, the condition on the 
norm to be.A0 = 1 and imposing.BN = B2 = 0. Then, solve the problem again 
with the condition on the norm to be .BN = B2 = 1 and imposing .A0 = 0. So, 
in the first case, the eigenfunction in regions.R0 and.R2 takes the form: 
.ϕE,1(x) =
 
eiq0 x + B0e−iq0 x x ∈ R0
A2eiq2 x x ∈ R2
(3.34) 
whereas in the second case it takes the form 
.ϕE,2(x) =
 B0e−iq0 x x ∈ R0
A2eiq2 x + e−iq2 x x ∈ R2
. (3.35) 
Now let’s consider the continuity conditions for the function and its derivative. 
The continuity condition for the function at points.x1 and.x2 yields 
. A0eiq0 x1 + B0e−iq0 x1 = A1eiq1 x1 + B1e−iq1 x1
A1eiq1 x2 + B1e−iq1 x2 = A2eiq2 x2 + B2e−iq2 x2 (3.36) 
while the continuity condition for the derivative at points.x1 and.x2 yields 
. iq0
(
A0eiq0 x1 − B0e−iq0 x1
)
= iq1
(
A1eiq1 x1 + B1e−iq1 x1
)
iq1
(
A1eiq1 x2 + B1e−iq1 x2
)
= iq2
(
A2eiq2 x2 + B2e−iq2 x2
) (3.37) 
To find the eigenfunction .ϕE,1, we simply need to set .A0 = 1 and .B2 = 0 and 
use the four equations (3.36) and (3.37) to solve for.B0, A1, B1, A2. To find the 
eigenfunction .ϕE,2, we just need to set.A0 = 0 and.B2 = 1 and once again use 
the four equations (3.36) and (3.37) to solve for.B0, A1, B1, A2.3.2 Piecewise Constant Potential 75
If the potential had a generic number .N of discontinuity points, the procedure 
would be exactly the same. To find two mutually orthonormal solutions, we 
would need to set .A0 = 1 and .BN = 0 for the eigenfunction .ϕE,1 and . A0 = 0
and .BN = 1 for the eigenfunction .ϕE,2. This way, the number of unknowns 
reduces from.2N + 2 to.2N, and we can use the.2N equations for the continuity 
of the function and its derivative to determine them. 
If the value of the potential in region.R0 were greater than the value of the poten￾tial in region.RN , i.e.,.V0 > VN , the discussion remains entirely valid, but in that 
case, the energy.E must be greater than.V0. 
(2) If the energy is such that.VN = V2 ≥ E > V0, then, as discussed under Eq. (3.29), 
we must add the additional equation .BN = B2 = 0 to the system of equations; 
otherwise, the corresponding eigenfunction does not satisfy Eq. (3.15). In this 
case, the condition on the norm is chosen to be.A0 = 1, and thus, the eigenfunc￾tion in regions.R0 and.R2 takes the form 
.ϕE (x) =
 
eiq0 x + B0e−iq0 x x ∈ R0
A2e−k2 x x ∈ R2
(3.38) 
We then have only 4 unknowns to determine, namely, .B0, A1, B1, A2. To do 
this, we simply need to use the continuity conditions for the function and its 
derivative, which in this case provide: 
. eiq0 x1 + B0e−iq0 x1 = A1eiq1 x1 + B1e−iq1 x1
A1eiq1 x2 + B1e−iq1 x2 = A2e−k2 x2 (3.39) 
and 
. iq0
(
eiq0 x1 − B0e−iq0 x1
)
= iq1
(
A1eiq1 x1 + B1e−iq1 x1
)
iq1
(
A1eiq1 x2 + B1e−iq1 x2
)
= −k2 A2e−k2 x2 (3.40) 
This system of equations admits only one solution, and therefore, there exists 
only one eigenfunction .ϕE with energy . E; in other words, the eigenvalue .E is 
degenerate only once. 
If the potential had a generic number .N of discontinuity points, the procedure 
would be exactly the same. Simply impose the condition on the norm . A0 = 1
and the condition .BN = 0, which ensures that the eigenfunction belongs to the 
Hilbert space of physical solutions, see again Eq. (3.30). This way, the number 
of unknowns reduces from.2N + 2 to.2N, and we can use the.2N equations for 
the continuity of the function and its derivative to determine them. 
If the value of the potential in region .R0 were greater than the value of the 
potential in region .RN , i.e., .V0 > VN , the discussion we just had remains valid 
provided that we exchange region.R0 with region.RN . So, if the energy. E satisfies 
.V0 ≥ E > VN , the condition on the norm becomes.BN = 1, while the property76 3 Quantum Particle in One Dimension
in Eq. (3.15) implies that either.A0 = 0 if.E < V0 or.B0 = 0 if.E = V0, as seen 
again in Eq. (3.28). In any case, the number of unknowns reduces from. 2N + 2
to .2N, and we can use the .2N equations for the continuity of the function and 
its derivative to determine them. 
(3) If the energy .E ≤ V0, as seen in Eq. (3.13), there are no solutions with energy 
.E < V0 when.V0 = Vmin. However, we could have solutions with energy between 
.Vmin and .V0 if .V0 ≥ Vmin. This is precisely the case for the potential in Fig. 3.1 
because .V0 > V1 = Vmin. As discussed under Eqs. (3.27) and (3.29), for these 
energies, the physical eigenfunctions are characterized by the condition.A0 = 0 if 
.E < V0 or.B0 = 0 if.E = V0 for the region.R0 and by the condition. BN = B2 = 0
in the region .RN = R2. We also need to choose a condition for the norm; for 
example, let’s choose.A2 = 1. So, in the case of.E < V0, we have. A0 = B2 = 0
and.A2 = 1. This leaves us with only 3 unknowns:.B0, A1, B1 to satisfy the. 2N =
4 equations for the continuity of the function and its derivative. Similarly, if we 
consider the case of.E = V0, we have.B0 = B2 = 0 and.A2 = 1, and we still have 
only 3 unknowns:.A0, A1, B1 to satisfy the.2N = 4 equations for the continuity of 
the function and its derivative. Since the number of equations exceeds the number 
of unknowns, there are generally no solutions at these energies unless... one of the 
equations in the system is a linear combination of the others. This could happen 
for some special values of the energy. E. The set of special energies for which a 
solution still exists can be either empty (no eigenstates with energy.E < V0) or 
a set consisting of a finite number of energies or a set consisting of a countably 
infinite number of energies. The case of.E < V0 represents the first example of 
energy quantization. Unlike the classical case, not all energies between . Vmin
and .V0 are possible. Eigenfunctions with energies .E < V0 are called bound 
states. The term “bound states” comes from the fact that the eigenfunctions tend 
to zero exponentially as.x → ±∞, and therefore, the probability of finding the 
particle is maximum near the potential well. In other words, the potential well 
tends to bind the particle. 
Let’s see explicitly how to deal with the case of Fig. 3.1. For.E < V0, the continuity 
conditions for the function and its derivative yield: 
. B0ek0 x1 = A1eiq1 x1 + B1e−iq1 x1
A1eiq1 x2 + B1e−iq1 x2 = e−k2 x2 (3.41) 
and 
. k0B0ek0 x1 = iq1
(
A1eiq1 x1 − B1e−iq1 x1
)
iq1
(
A1eiq1 x2 − B1e−iq1 x2
)
= −k2e−k2 x2 (3.42) 
We can represent this system in matrix form as follows:3.2 Piecewise Constant Potential 77

The solutions to this equation provide the discrete energies at which bound states 
can exist. 
If the potential has a generic number of .N discontinuity points, the procedure 
would be exactly the same. By imposing.A0 = 0 for.E < V0 or.B0 = 0 for. E = V0
in region .R0, .BN = 0 in region .RN , and choosing the condition on the norm to 
be, for example,.AN = 1, the number of unknowns reduces from.2N + 2 to.2N − 1. 
Therefore, a solution to the system of.2N equations exists only if one of the equations 
can be written as a linear combination of the others. 
In Table 3.1, we summarize what has been discussed so far. This table shows the 
form of the eigenfunctions (last three columns) for different possible energies (first 
column) in various regions, for the case.VN ≥ V0.78 3 Quantum Particle in One Dimension
3.3 Piecewise Constant Potential with Dirac Deltas 
It is possible to calculate exactly the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian even when we 
add, in some places, Dirac delta functions to a constant potential. The procedure is 
indeed identical to that discussed in the previous section, except for a very small 
difference. Let’s see it. 
We denote by.x1 < x2 < ··· xN the points at which the potential.V(x) is discon￾tinuous or contains a Dirac delta, or both. This means that for.x j−1 < x < x j+1, the 
potential has the following form: 
.V(x) = aj δ(x − x j) +
 Vj−1 x < x j
Vj x > x j
(3.45) 
If .aj = 0 and .Vj−1 /= Vj , then at . x j , the potential is simply discontinuous, just as 
before. If.aj /= 0 and.Vj−1 = Vj , then the potential contains a Dirac delta at. x j , and 
its value is the same on both sides of . x j . Finally, if .aj /= 0 and .Vj−1 /= Vj , then 
the potential contains a Dirac delta at .x j and has different values on the left and 
right sides of . x j . In any case, the potential is a constant equal to .Vj in the region 
.Rj = (x j, x j+1). Therefore, in the region.Rj , the Schrödinger equation is once again 
given by Eq. (3.24), and the most general solution is exactly the same as before 
.ϕE (x) =
 Aj eiqj x + Bj e−iqj x E /= Vj
Aj + Bj x E = Vj
, x ∈ Rj (3.46) 
where 
.qj =
/2m
 2 (E − Vj). (3.47) 
To calculate the constants .Aj and .Bj, we can proceed in the same way as before, 
except for the fact that we need to modify the continuity condition for the derivative. 
Let us reconsider Eq. (3.32). Regardless of the value of. ϵ, we have 
.
x j+ϵ ʃ
x j−ϵ
aj δ(x − x j)ϕE (x) = ajϕE (x j) (3.48) 
and hence

ϵ→0
[ϕ'
E (x j + ϵ) − ϕ'
E (x j − ϵ)] =
2maj
 2 ϕE (x j) ∀x j . (3.49) 
If.aj = 0, which means in the absence of the Dirac delta, we recover the continuity 
condition for the first derivative. Conversely, we should impose the condition for 
the discontinuity of the first derivative, as given by Eq. (3.49). Since we have .N3.4 Reflection and Transmission Coefficients 79
points. x j , Eq. (3.49) provides.N equations, and we can proceed exactly as before to 
determine the eigenfunctions. 
One final observation. The value.ϕE (x j) of the eigenfunction at.x j is unique and 
well-defined because the eigenfunction is continuous. We can express this value using 
either the form of the eigenfunction in .Rj−1 = (x j−1, x j) and then setting . x = x j
or the form of the eigenfunction in .Rj = (x j, x j+1) and then setting .x = x j . The 
continuity condition at.x j ensures that the result remains unchanged. 
3.4 Reflection and Transmission Coefficients 
Let us consider a piecewise constant potential with or without Dirac deltas. We have 
seen that for energies. E greater than both.V0 and.VN , there exist two eigenfunctions 
of energy . E, and these eigenfunctions in the regions .R0 and .RN take the form in 
Eqs. (3.34) and (3.35). Let us focus on Eq. (3.34), as the same considerations apply 
to the other equation. It is very common to denote the coefficient .B0 with the letter 
.R and the coefficient.AN with the letter. T , so: 
.ϕE,1(x) =
 
eiq0 x + R e−iq0 x x ∈ R0
T eiqN x x ∈ RN
(3.50) 
As we know, the plane wave .eiq0 x is proportional to the scalar product between a 
position eigenket and a momentum eigenket with an eigenvalue of . q0. Therefore, 
we can interpret the state of the electron in region.R0 as an electron with momentum 
. q0 > 0 moving from left to right and, with a probability proportional to.|R|
2, being 
reflected as an electron with momentum.− q0 moving from right to left. Similarly, 
we can interpret the state of the electron in region.RN as an electron that, with a prob￾ability proportional to.|T |
2, is transmitted into this region with momentum. qN > 0
and thus moves from left to right. Due to this physical interpretation, the coeffi￾cients .R and .T are called the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient, 
respectively. 
We want to use the continuity equation to derive an exact relationship between 
the reflection and transmission coefficients. Since the eigenfunction does not depend 
on time, it follows that neither the probability density nor the probability current 
depends on time. Furthermore, from Eq. (3.21), we also deduce that .J (x) must be 
independent of. x. Calculating. J in the region.R0, we find 
.J = 
m q0(1 − |R|
2
), (3.51) 
whereas if. J is calculated in region.RN we find 
.J = 
m qN |T |
2
. (3.52)80 3 Quantum Particle in One Dimension
Equating these two results we obtain the sought relation 
. q0(1 − |R|
2
) = qN |T |
2 (3.53) 
It is interesting to note that if.V0 = VN , then.q0 = qN , as seen in Eq. (3.26), and the 
relationship above becomes: 
. |R|
2 + |T |
2 = 1 (3.54) 
The physical interpretation of this result is transparent. The probability that an inci￾dent electron may be reflected, when summed with the probability that it may be 
transmitted, equals 1. A similar reasoning can be applied to the eigenfunction . ϕE,2
by identifying the reflection coefficient with .AN and the transmission coefficient 
with.B0. 
3.5 Harmonic Potential 
Let us consider a quantum spring with spring constant . k, one end attached to the 
origin of coordinates, and the other end connected to a particle of mass .m free to 
move along the.x-axis. Denoting the position of the particle as. l and the rest length of 
the spring as. l0, the particle experiences a force given by.F(x) = − d
dx V(x), where 
the distance. x is defined as.x = l − l0, and 
.V(x) = 1

try to rewrite the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator using the non-Hermitian 
operators

Let us try to understand the possible values of. λ. It turns out that

and 
.aˆ †
aˆ aˆ|λ⟩ = [ˆa†
aˆ, aˆ]|λ⟩ + λaˆ|λ⟩ = (λ − 1)aˆ|λ⟩. (3.66) 
So, the ket.aˆ †|λ⟩ and the ket.aˆ|λ⟩ are eigenstates of.aˆ †aˆ with eigenvalues.λ + 1 and 
.λ − 1, respectively. For this reason, the operator .aˆ † is called the raising operator, 
and the operator . aˆ is called the lowering operator. Not yet knowing if these kets 
are normalized to unity, we can write: 
.aˆ †
|λ⟩ = αλ|λ + 1⟩ ˆa|λ⟩ = βλ|λ − 1⟩. (3.67) 
Calculating the proportionality coefficients is quickly done

Therefore 
. aˆ †
|λ⟩ = √
λ + 1|λ + 1⟩ ˆa|λ⟩ = √
λ|λ − 1⟩ (3.70) 
The second of these last two relationships is particularly important. Equation (3.69) 
holds for all eigenvalues. λ; therefore, all eigenvalues must be non-negative because 
the squared modulus of a complex number, such as .|βλ|
2, is greater than or equal 
to zero. Let .λmin ≥ 0 be the smallest eigenvalue. The second relation in Eq. (3.70) 
tells us that .aˆ|λmin⟩ is an eigenket with an eigenvalue of .λmin − 1, which is absurd, 
considering that.λmin is the smallest eigenvalue. The only way out from this contra￾diction is for .λmin = 0. In this case, indeed, .aˆ|0⟩ = √0| − 1⟩ = |∅⟩, which means 
the action of. aˆ on the ket.|0⟩ produces the null ket.|∅⟩, which is not a physical state 
as it has zero norm (the representation of the null ket is, regardless of the basis, a 
vector with all components equal to zero). 
We conclude that the lowest eigenvalue of.aˆ †aˆ is zero, and in accordance with the 
introduced notation, we denote the corresponding eigenket as.|0⟩. All other eigenkets 
and eigenvalues of.aˆ †aˆ can be obtained using the raising operator. From the first of 
Eq. (3.70), we have:

The kets.|n⟩ are also eigenkets of the Hamiltonian, as it follows from Eq. (3.64),

)|n⟩ (3.73) 
The possible eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian represent the possible measurements 
of energy, and from Eq. (3.73), we see that they do not form a continuous spectrum. 
The harmonic oscillator is the second example of a system where the energy is 
quantized. The ground state of the harmonic oscillator is the ket.|0⟩. It is indeed the 
eigenket with the lowest eigenvalue, which is . ω/2 > 0. Classically, the minimum 
energy is obtained when the particle is at rest (zero momentum) at the potential 
minimum (.x = 0). As we have seen in Sect. 1.8, such a state is not compatible with 
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, as both the position and momentum values would 
be simultaneously known without any uncertainty. The classical result is recovered 
if Planck’s constant were zero, i.e.,. = 0. 
We can easily verify that Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is satisfied for any 
eigenket of. Hˆ . Since eigenkets with different energies are orthogonal to each other, 
the mean values of. xˆ and. pˆ are zero. Indeed:

3.5.2 Eigenfunctions and Hermite Polynomials 
In this section, we want to explicitly calculate the form of the eigenfunctions. ψn(x) =
⟨x|n⟩ of the Hamiltonian, which is the inner product between a position bra and 
an eigenket of the Hamiltonian. This allows us to know the probability density of 
finding the particle at. x when it is prepared in an eigenket of the Hamiltonian. From

where .Hn(x¯) is a polynomial of degree . n in. x¯. In particular, .Hn contains only even 
powers if . n is even and only odd powers if . n is odd. These polynomials are called 
Hermite polynomials. In addition to the ones we have already found, here are some 
others:86 3 Quantum Particle in One Dimension

H5(x¯) = 32x¯5 − 160x¯3 + 120x¯
H6(x¯) = 64x¯6 − 480x¯4 + 720x¯2 − 120. (3.89) 
In Fig. 3.2, we show the behavior of the first three eigenfunctions of the harmonic 
oscillator. It can be observed that if the particle is in the ground state .ψ0, the prob￾ability density is maximum at the origin and then decreases as we move away from 
it. The particle in the first excited state has zero probability of being at the origin, 
consistent with the fact that the Hermite polynomial .H1 is an odd function. More 
generally, the wavefunction of the . nth excited state exhibits . n nodes, meaning . n
values of. x where the probability density is zero. 
3.5.3 Coherent States 
We have shown that the average value of position and momentum is zero if the particle 
is in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, see Eqs. (3.74) and (3.75). Furthermore, as3.5 Harmonic Potential 87
discussed below Eq. (1.153), the average value of an operator is time-independent if 
the initial state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, the average values of 
position and momentum continue to be zero if the initial state is one of the kets.|n⟩. 
However, classically, a particle attached to a spring is described by an oscillatory 
trajectory .x(t) = A cos(ωt − φ) and thus by an oscillating momentum .p = mx˙(t). 
This means that to recover the classical result, the initial state cannot be an eigenstate 
of. Hˆ . In this section, we find out how the initial state should be prepared so that the 
average values of position and momentum behave as in the classical case. 
Consider the lowering operator . aˆ and denote by .|Φγ⟩ one of its eigenkets with 
eigenvalue. γ, normalized to one: 
.aˆ|Φγ⟩ = γ|Φγ⟩, ⟨Φγ|Φγ⟩ = 1. (3.90) 
Since . aˆ is not Hermitian, the eigenvalue . γ can also be complex. We want to show 
that 
.|Φγ⟩ = C eγaˆ †
|0⟩ (3.91) 
where.C is a normalization constant that we determine later, and.|0⟩ is the eigenket 
with the lowest energy of the harmonic oscillator. The proof is quite simple. We 
define the commutator 
.Qˆ n = [ˆa, (aˆ †
)
n] (3.92) 
Using the identity .[Aˆ, BˆCˆ]=[Aˆ, Bˆ]Cˆ + Bˆ[Aˆ,Cˆ] with .Aˆ = ˆa, .Bˆ = ˆa†, and . Cˆ =
(aˆ †)n−1, we can proceed as we did in Eq. (1.119) and find

Varying. γ in the domain of complex numbers, these states are called coherent states. 
If the particle is in the coherent state .|Φγ⟩, the probability of measuring energy

.P(En) = |⟨n|Φγ⟩|2 = e−|γ|

This probability distribution is known as the Poisson distribution. In Fig. 3.3, the 
values of.P(En), with.n = 0,..., 30, are shown for three different values of. γ, and 
as can be seen, it is highest for.n ∼ γ. 
Let us now consider the average value of the position operator. We rewrite 
Eq. (3.58) using the definition of.x0 in Eq. (3.81) 
.xˆ = x0

So, the average value of the position operator is not zero if the particle is described by 
a coherent state. Let us study how the coherent state evolves in time. Without loss of 
generality, assume that.|Φγ⟩ describes the particle at time.t = 0, so.|ψ(0)⟩=|Φγ⟩, 
and denote by.|ψ(t)⟩ the ket describing the particle at time. t. Since the Hamiltonian 
is time-independent, Eq. (1.152) holds, and therefore

This result is extremely interesting. It tells us that if the initial state is a coherent state 
described by the complex number . γ, then the state at time . t is still a coherent state 
but it is described by the complex number .γe−iωt
. Using Eq. (3.100), we conclude 
that the average value of the position operator at time. t is given by 
.⟨ψ(t)| ˆx|ψ(t)⟩=⟨Φγe−iωt | ˆx|Φγe−iωt⟩ = √

replacing .γ → γe−iωt = |γ|e−iωt+iφ = |γ| cos(ωt − φ) − i|γ|sin(ωt − φ), as seen 
in Eq. (3.101). So, at time. t, we have.γ1 = |γ| cos(ωt − φ) and. γ2 = −|γ|sin(ωt −

expected, the center of the Gaussian coincides with the mean value of the position

with.a > 0 and.b > 0. Once the value of. a is fixed, we ask 
i. Determine for which values of. b there is at least one bound state. 
ii. There can be two or more bound states? 
Solution The value of the potential for .x → ∞ is zero while for .x → −∞ is 
.∞; therefore we must look for eigenfunctions of energy less than zero. Given the 
structure of the potential, the generic eigenfunction of energy .E less than zero 
can be written as

immediately .A = −B. By imposing the continuity condition in .x = b we find 
.A(e2kb − 1) = C. Finally, by imposing the condition on the discontinuity of the 
first derivative in .x = b is found .−Ck − Ak(e2kb + 1) = −2ma

in this last equation the value of .C obtained previously we obtain94 3 Quantum Particle in One Dimension

As can be seen from the graph, for there to exist a. k such that the two functions 
can be equal, the first derivative at .k = 0 of the function on the left must be less 
than the first derivative at.k = 0 of the function on the right side of the equation.

ii. Since.ϕ(x) is a linear combination of degenerate eigenfunctions the probabil￾ity density is independent of time and therefore the current must be independent

Since the potential is even, the eigenfunctions are either even or odd and in the 
range.(−L/2, L/2) they have the form 
. ODD : ψ(x) = A
 
sin k(x + L/2) , x < 0
sin k(x − L/2) , x > 0
. EVEN : ψ(x) = A
 
sin k(x + L/2) , x < 0
− sin k(x − L/2) , x > 0
Determine the possible values of. k in the even and odd cases. 
Solution In the case of odd parity, the continuity condition at .x = 0 is satis￾fied for .k = 2nπ/L, and for such values of . k, the discontinuity condition of 
the first derivative is automatically satisfied. A possible choice for . n to obtain 
independent eigenfunctions is. n = 1, 2, 3,...
In the case of even parity, the continuity condition at .x = 0 is always satisfied. 
However, the condition of discontinuity of the first derivative leads to

In this case, independent eigenfunctions are obtained, for example, by taking all 
positive solutions of the above equation for . k.

so, determine the eigenfunction, otherwise motivate why it’s not possible. 
Solution i. The eigenvalues .En of the Hamiltonian are the same as those of a 
single well with infinite walls since the eigenfunctions are those of the single 
well on the right, let’s denote them by .ϕ(+) n (x), or of the single well on the left, 
let’s indicate them with.ϕ(−) n (x). So.En = 2n2π2

ii. From point i. it follows that the degeneracy of each eigenvalue.En is equal to

Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions 
In this chapter, we address the quantum description of a particle with mass. m in three 
dimensions. 
4.1 Momentum Operator and Hamiltonian 
In three dimensions, the ket describing the particle at the point.r = (x, y,z)is denoted 
as.|r⟩=|xyz⟩, while the ket describing the particle with momentum. p = (px , py , pz)
is denoted as .|p⟩=|px py pz⟩. Sometimes, for notational simplicity, the position 
coordinates.(x, y,z) are also denoted as.(r1,r2,r3), and the momentum coordinates 
.(px , py , pz) are also denoted as .(p1, p2, p3). Similarly, we denote by .rˆi the i-th 
component of the position operator and by.pˆi the i-th component of the momentum 
operator. Therefore 
.rˆi|r⟩ = ri|r⟩, pˆi|p⟩ = pi|p⟩. (4.1) 
As we have already seen in Eqs. (1.130) and (1.134), the scalar product between two 
position eigenkets and two momentum eigenkets is 
.⟨r|r'
⟩ = δ(x − x'
)δ(y − y'

) = δ(r1 − r'

Let us consider a generic ket.|ψ⟩ that describes our particle in three dimensions, and 
let us learn how to calculate .⟨r| ˆpi|ψ⟩. By inserting the resolution of the identity in 
the momentum basis, as seen in Eq. (1.135), and setting.d3p ≡ dp1dp2dp3, we have

The scalar product .ψ(r) = ⟨r|ψ⟩ is the wave function, already encountered in 
Sect. 1.4, whose square modulus provides the probability density of finding the 
electron at. r.

Note that the potential energy is a function of the position operators . rˆi : . V(rˆ) =

position operator is also an eigenket of.V(rˆ) with eigenvalue. V(r) = V(r1,r2,r3) =
V(x, y,z). We can easily transform the Schrödinger equation into an equation for the 
wave function.ψ(r, t) = ⟨r|ψ(t)⟩ by multiplying on the left by the bra.⟨r|. Keeping 
in mind that.⟨r|V(rˆ) = ⟨r|V (r) and using Eq. (4.10) we find

As seen several times before, the knowledge of the eigenfunctions . ϕE,k (r) =

satisfy

(4.18)112 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions
where, as usual, . k is the index used to distinguish eigenfunctions corresponding to 
the same eigenvalue in case the latter is degenerate. The set of eigenfunctions forms 
a basis, so we can expand .|ψ(t)⟩ in this basis. In Sect. 1.7, we have shown that the 
solution is given by 
. |ψ(t)⟩ = ∑
E,k

h ϕE,k (r)
(4.19) 
where 
.cE,k (0) = ⟨E, k|ψ(0)⟩. (4.20) 
Note that, similarly to the case of one-dimensional systems, not all functions that 
satisfy Eq. (4.18) belong to the Hilbert space generated by the physical kets. The 
Hilbert space for the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian operator is the space of 
continuous functions such that 
. lim

So, if for a certain energy. E we find a function.ϕ(r)that satisfies Eq. (4.18) but.ϕ(r)is 
not continuous or does not satisfy the condition in Eq. (4.21), then this function does 
not belong to the Hilbert space and, therefore, cannot be considered an eigenfunction. 
4.2 Virial Theorem 
We want to demonstrate an important result that relates the mean value of the kinetic 
energy .Tˆ = pˆ2
2m and the mean value of the potential energy .Vˆ = V(rˆ) for a generic 
eigenket of the Hamiltonian.Hˆ = Tˆ + Vˆ . Consider a generic eigenket.|E, k⟩ of. Hˆ .

In the last step, we use the fact that the momentum operator commutes with the 
kinetic energy, and the position operator commutes with the potential energy. The 
second commutator is straightforward to calculate and gives

It’s important to emphasize that this identity between average values is satisfied only 
when the average value is taken over one of the eigenkets of. Hˆ . If we replaced. |E, k⟩
with a generic ket.|ψ⟩, the identity above would not be satisfied. 
Alright, now let us consider the case where.i = j and sum over all three compo￾nents. We obtain.

i = 2Tˆ where . Tˆ is the kinetic energy operator. From this, 
we conclude that 
.⟨E, k|rˆ · ∇V(rˆ)|E, k⟩ = 2⟨E, k|Tˆ|E, k⟩. (4.27) 
This result is known as the virial theorem. The proof presented here in three dimen￾sions is clearly entirely general, and therefore, the virial theorem can also be applied 
in one or two dimensions. In one dimension, the virial theorem is written as. 
.⟨E, k| ˆx ∂
∂x
V(xˆ)|E, k⟩ = 2⟨E, k|Tˆ|E, k⟩. (4.28) 
Let us examine in detail some simple cases. For the one-dimensional harmonic 
oscillator, we have.V(x) = 1
2mω2x 2, and therefore,.x dV(x)
dx = 2V(x). It follows that 
.⟨Vˆ⟩=⟨Tˆ⟩, (4.29) 
where the average is taken over a generic eigenket of the harmonic oscillator.114 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions
In one dimension, if the particle is subjected to the potential .V(x) = λx n, then 
.x dV (x)
dx = nV(x), and thus the virial theorem tells us thar 
.n⟨Vˆ⟩ = 2⟨Tˆ⟩, (4.30) 
where the average is taken over a generic eigenket of the Hamiltonian.Hˆ = Tˆ + λxˆn. 
Now, let us consider an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in three dimensions with 
the potential.V(r) = 1
2m(ω2

z z2). We have 
.r · ∇V(r) = x
∂V(r)
∂x + y

∂V(r)
∂z = 2V(r). (4.31) 
Therefore the relation 
.⟨Vˆ⟩=⟨Tˆ⟩, (4.32) 
is valid in three dimensions as well. As before, the average is taken over a generic 
eigenket of the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. 
Finally, let’s consider the case of a Coulomb potential.V(r) = −Ze2/r where. Ze
is the charge of the nucleus,. e is the charge of the electron, and. r = √
x 2 + y2 + z2
is the distance of the electron from the nucleus. We have 
.
∂V(r)

r 3 ri ⇒ r · ∇V(r) = −V(r), (4.33) 
and therefore the virial theorem reads 
.⟨Vˆ⟩=−2⟨Tˆ⟩, (4.34) 
where the average is taken over a generic eigenket of the Hamiltonian . Hˆ = Tˆ −
Ze2/rˆ. 
4.3 Separable Hamiltonians 
Consider the case in which the potential .V(r) can be expressed as the sum of three 
functions, one depending solely on. x, one depending solely on. y, and one depending 
solely on. z: 
.V(r) = V1(x) + V2(y) + V3(z). (4.35) 
Solving the eigenvalue problem in three dimensions, namely Eq. (4.18), reduces 
to solving three one-dimensional problems. Let us see how it works. Consider the 
following three one-dimensional eigenvalue problems:4.3 Separable Hamiltonians 115

(4.38) 
The operator.Hˆi acts only on the ith degree of freedom. Let us then consider the ket

In the first equality, we simply use the completeness relation .
ʃ d3r|r⟩⟨r| = 1. The 
second line “defines” the scalar product between a position eigenket and the ket in the 
left hand side, thus defining the ket itself. In the third line, we simply use Eq. (4.37). 
From the definition, it follows that the ket.|E1, k1; E2, k2; E3, k3⟩ describes a particle 
that, along the . x direction, is neither in a position eigenstate nor in an eigenstate of 
the conjugate momentum, but is in the. k1th eigenstate of.Hˆ1 with eigenvalue.E1. The 
same considerations apply to the. y and. z directions. Therefore, we have 
. ⟨r|Hˆi|E1, k1; E2, k2; E3, k3⟩ = (

= Ei ⟨r|E1, k1; E2, k2; E3, k3⟩ (4.40) 
Since this equation must hold for all. r, we obtain 
.Hˆi|E1, k1; E2, k2; E3, k3⟩ = Ei|E1, k1; E2, k2; E3, k3⟩, (4.41)116 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions
from which it follows that 
.Hˆ |E1, k1; E2, k2; E3, k3⟩ = (E1 + E2 + E3)|E1, k1; E2, k2; E3, k3⟩. (4.42) 
Thus, the ket in Eq. (4.39) is an eigenket of the total Hamiltonian with an eigenvalue 
of.E1 + E2 + E3. 
We observe that regardless of the choice of values for .k1, k2, k3, the energy of 
the eigenket is always the same. This implies that the energy . E = E1 + E2 + E3
is at least as degenerate as the product of the degeneracies of .E1, .E2, and .E3. The 
reason why the degeneracy of. E could be even greater is that there might be different 
values of .E1, .E2, and .E3 with the same sum. For example, let us suppose that 
the eigenvalues .E1 are all non-degenerate and given by .E1 = n1E with .n1 as a 
non-negative integer. The same holds for.E2 = n2E and.E3 = n3E. Despite the non￾degenerate eigenvalues.E1,.E2, and.E3 in their respective one-dimensional problems, 
the eigenvalue.E = E1 + E2 + E3 = (n1 + n2 + n3)E is, in general, degenerate. For 
example, the eigenvalue .E = E is three times degenerate because we can obtain it 
by choosing the triplet of integers.(n1, n2, n3) = (1, 0, 0) or.(0, 1, 0) or.(0, 0, 1). 
The discussion made so far is not limited to three-dimensional problems. Consider 
a system with .M degrees of freedom .q1,..., qM , and let .p1,..., pM denote the 
corresponding conjugate momenta. The Hamiltonian of the system is said to be 
separable if it can be written as 
.Hˆ = ∑
M
i=1
Hi(qˆi, pˆi). (4.43) 
In this case, we can obtain its eigenstates by separately solving.M eigenvalue prob￾lems 
.Hi(qˆi, pˆi)|Ei, ki⟩ = Ei|Ei, ki⟩, i = 1,..., M. (4.44) 
Using the same reasoning as before, we have 
. Hˆ |E1, k1;...; EM , kM ⟩ = H1(qˆ1, pˆ1)|E1, k1;...; EM , kM ⟩
+···
+ HM (qˆM , pˆM )|E1, k1;...; EM , kM ⟩
= (E1 +···+ EM )|E1, k1;...; EM , kM ⟩. (4.45) 
To summarize, we have found that if the Hamiltonian is separable, then its eigen￾functions are the product of the eigenfunctions of the individual subproblems, and 
the eigenvalues are the sum of the eigenvalues of the individual subproblems.4.4 Quantum Particle in an Electromagnetic Field 117
4.4 Quantum Particle in an Electromagnetic Field 
In the case of a particle with mass .m and charge .Q in three dimensions immersed

(4.49) 
Similarly to the case in the previous section, both the scalar and vector potentials are 
functions of the operators . rˆi . Therefore, any eigenket .|r⟩ of the three components 
of the position operator is also an eigenket of .φ(rˆ, t) with eigenvalue . φ(r, t) =
φ(r1,r2,r3, t) = φ(x, y,z, t) and of each component of the vector potential. Ai(rˆ, t)
with eigenvalue.Ai(r, t) = Ai(r1,r2,r3, t) = Ai(x, y,z, t). 
As usual, we can transform the Schrödinger equation into an equation for the 
wave function .ψ(r, t) = ⟨r|ψ(t)⟩ by bracketing on the left by the bra .⟨r|. Keeping 
in mind that.⟨r|φ(rˆ) = ⟨r|φ(r) and that.⟨r|Ai(rˆ) = ⟨r|Ai(r), and always keeping in 
mind Eq. (4.9), we have118 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions

In this equation, a very important operator in quantum mechanics has appeared, 
namely the angular momentum operator .rˆ × pˆ. In the next sections, we introduce 
the physical and mathematical framework necessary to deal with this operator. 
4.5 Angular Momentum 
The angular momentum operator is a vector of operators and is defined as in 
classical mechanics 
.Lˆ = rˆ × pˆ = −pˆ × rˆ. (4.61) 
Note that despite the non-commutation of the position operator and the momentum 
operator, the second identity in Eq. (4.61) holds because the vector product only 
contains combinations .rˆi pˆj with .i /= j, and we know that, according to the sixth 
postulate,.[ ˆri, pˆj] = ihδi j . We indeed have 
.Lˆ x = ˆy pˆz − ˆz pˆ y ; Lˆ y = ˆz pˆx − ˆx pˆz; Lˆ z = ˆx pˆ y
− ˆy pˆx . (4.62) 
It is easy to verify that all three components are Hermitian operators, i.e.,.Lˆi = Lˆ †
i . 
Equations (4.62) can be rewritten in a compact form using the Levi-Civita tensor 
.Lˆi = ∑
jk
εijkrˆj pˆk (4.63) 
where, as for the position and momentum operators, we use double notation 
.(Lˆ x , Lˆ y , Lˆ z) = (Lˆ 1, Lˆ 2, Lˆ 3). 
From the commutation rules .[ ˆri, pˆj] = ihδi j , it is easy to calculate the commu￾tation rules between the components of angular momentum. These, unlike the com￾mutation rules between the components of the position operator, .[ ˆri,rˆj] = 0, and 
between the components of the momentum operator,.[ ˆpi, pˆj] = 0, yield a non-zero 
result. In particular 
.[Lˆ x , Lˆ y ] = ihLˆ z; [Lˆ z, Lˆ x ] = ihLˆ y ; [Lˆ y , Lˆ z] = ihLˆ x . (4.64) 
Let us prove the first one as an example. The proof for the other two is entirely 
analogous. We have4.6 Simultaneous Eigenkets of Lˆ 2 and Lˆ z 121
. [Lˆ x , Lˆ y ] = [ˆy pˆz − ˆz pˆ y ,zˆ pˆx − ˆx pˆz]
= [ˆy pˆz,zˆ pˆx ]−[ˆy pˆz, xˆ pˆz] − [ˆz pˆ y ,zˆ pˆx ] + [ˆz pˆ y , xˆ pˆz]
= ˆy[ ˆpz,zˆ] ˆpx + ˆx[ˆz, pˆz] ˆpy
= −ihyˆ pˆx + ihxˆ pˆ y
= ihLˆ z. (4.65) 
Even the commutation rules in Eq. (4.64) can be rewritten in a compact form using 
the Levi-Civita tensor. In fact 
.[Lˆi, Lˆ j] = ih
∑
k
εijk Lˆ k . (4.66) 
Equation (4.66) is telling us that it is not possible to find simultaneous eigenkets of 
the three operators.(Lˆ x , Lˆ y , Lˆ z) since they do not commute. However, starting from 
them, it is possible to construct an operator that commutes with all three. This is the 
operator angular momentum squared 
.Lˆ 2 = Lˆ · Lˆ = Lˆ 2
x + Lˆ 2
y + Lˆ 2
z = ∑
i
Lˆ 2
i . (4.67) 
We have 
. [Lˆ 2

)
= ih
∑
ik
εijk (Lˆi Lˆ k + Lˆ k Lˆi). (4.68) 
Since, under the interchange of . i and . k, the Levi-Civita tensor is antisymmetric 
while the quantity in parentheses is symmetric, the result of the sum is zero, see 
Appendix B. In conclusion 
.[Lˆ 2
, Lˆ j] = 0. (4.69) 
Therefore, it is possible to find simultaneous eigenkets of .Lˆ 2 and one of the three 
components .Lˆ j . We follow the convention adopted by many and choose this com￾ponent to be.Lˆ z. 
4.6 Simultaneous Eigenkets of .Lˆ 2 and . Lˆ z
Since.Lˆ 2 and.Lˆ z commute and are Hermitian, they have real eigenvalues and admit 
a common basis of eigenvectors. We write the eigenvalues of .Lˆ 2 as .h2l(l + 1) and 
those of .Lˆ z as .hm. Note that the Planck constant has the dimensions of angular122 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions
momentum, so the unknown quantities.l(l + 1) and.m are dimensionless. Currently, 
we cannot say anything about . l and .m except that they are real numbers. Writing 
the eigenvalue of .Lˆ 2 as .h2l(l + 1) is a convenient choice for the presentation that 
follows. We could have written it as.h2√g, and nothing would have changed, except 
that we would have found less elegant conditions for. g than for. l. The possible values 
of.h2l(l + 1) and.h2√g would still be the same. 
We can obtain a first condition on. l by noting that the eigenvalues of.Lˆ 2 cannot be 
negative. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that.Lˆ 2 has an eigenvalue.h2w with 
.w < 0, and let .|w⟩ be the corresponding normalized eigenket: .Lˆ 2|w⟩ = h2w|w⟩. 
Multiplying this equation by the bra.⟨w| gives 
.⟨w|Lˆ 2
/h2
|w⟩ = ∑
i
⟨w|Lˆ 2
i /h2
|w⟩ = w < 0. (4.70) 
If we now define the kets.|vi⟩ = (Lˆi /h)|w⟩, since the operators.Lˆi are Hermitian, we 
have.⟨vi|=⟨w|(Lˆi/h). Therefore, the inequality in Eq. (4.70) can be rewritten as 
.
∑
i
⟨vi|vi⟩ = w < 0 (4.71) 
which is absurd, as the inner product between a bra and its ket cannot be negative. 
We conclude that.w ≥ 0. Any number greater than or equal to zero can be uniquely 
written as .l(l + 1) by choosing .l ≥ 0. Therefore, from now on, we consider . l as a 
non-negative real number. 
Let us also give a name to the simultaneous eigenket of.Lˆ 2 and.Lˆ z with eigenvalues 
.h2l(l + 1) and.hm, respectively. Since. l and. m uniquely identify the eigenvalues, we 
call.|l, m⟩ the corresponding normalized eigenket. Therefore 
.Lˆ 2
|l, m⟩ = h2
l(l + 1)|l, m⟩, Lˆ z|l, m⟩ = hm|l, m⟩, (4.72) 
and 
.⟨l, m|l, m⟩ = 1. (4.73) 
Now we demonstrate that, for a fixed . l, if .hm is a possible eigenvalue of .Lˆ z, then 
.h(m + 1) and .h(m − 1) are also eigenvalues of .Lˆ z. To do this, we construct the 
operators 
.Lˆ + = Lˆ x + iLˆ y , Lˆ − = Lˆ x − iLˆ y = (Lˆ +)

Using the commutation rules in Eq. (4.64) we find 
. [Lˆ z, Lˆ ±]=[Lˆ z, Lˆ x ± iLˆ y ] = ihLˆ y ± i(−ih)Lˆ x = ±h(Lˆ x ± iLˆ y ) = ±hLˆ ±,
(4.75)4.6 Simultaneous Eigenkets of Lˆ 2 and Lˆ z 123
and 
.[Lˆ +, L−]=[Lˆ x + iLˆ y , Lˆ x − iLˆ y ]=−i[Lˆ x , Lˆ y ] + i[Lˆ y , Lˆ x ] = 2hLˆ z. (4.76) 
Very well, let us now define the following ket 
.|ψ±⟩ ≡ Lˆ ±|l, m⟩. (4.77) 
Is this ket an eigenket of.Lˆ 2? If so, what is its eigenvalue? Let’s find out. 
. Lˆ 2
|ψ±⟩ = Lˆ 2Lˆ ±|l, m⟩ = Lˆ 2
(Lˆ x ± iLˆ y )|l, m⟩ = (Lˆ x ± iLˆ y )Lˆ 2
|l, m⟩
= h2
l(l + 1)Lˆ ±|l, m⟩
= h2
l(l + 1)|ψ±⟩. (4.78) 
So,.|ψ±⟩ is an eigenket of.Lˆ 2 with the same eigenvalue as the ket.|l, m⟩. What about 
.Lˆ z? Is .|ψ±⟩ also an eigenket of .Lˆ z? If so, what is its eigenvalue? Let us find out. 
Taking into account the commutation rule in Eq. (4.75), we have 
. Lˆ z|ψ±⟩ = Lˆ z Lˆ ±|l, m⟩ = (
[Lˆ z, Lˆ ±] + Lˆ ±Lˆ z
)
|l, m⟩ = (
±hLˆ ± + hmLˆ ±
)
|l, m⟩
= h(m ± 1)|ψ±⟩. (4.79) 
Therefore.|ψ±⟩ is an eigenket of.Lˆ z with eigenvalue.h(m ± 1). 
Since .|ψ±⟩ is a simultaneous eigenket of.Lˆ 2 and.Lˆ z with eigenvalues. h2l(l + 1)
and.h(m ± 1), respectively, we must conclude that this ket is proportional to the ket 
. |l, m ± 1⟩
.|ψ±⟩ = Lˆ ±|l, m⟩ = C±|l, m ± 1⟩. (4.80) 
To determine the normalization constant, we can use the normalization condition in 
Eq. (4.73), which holds for every. l and. m. We have 
.|C±|
2 = ⟨l, m|(Lˆ ±)
†Lˆ ±|l, m⟩=⟨l, m|Lˆ ∓Lˆ ±|l, m⟩. (4.81) 
We now observe that 
.Lˆ ∓Lˆ ± = (Lˆ x ∓ iLˆ y )(Lˆ x ± iLˆ y ) = Lˆ 2
x + Lˆ 2
y ± i[Lˆ x , Lˆ y ] = Lˆ 2 − Lˆ 2
z ∓ hLˆ z (4.82) 
where, in the last step, we rewrite.Lˆ 2
x + Lˆ 2
y as.Lˆ 2 − Lˆ 2
z and use the first commutation 
rule in Eq. (4.64). Substituting this result into Eq. (4.81), we find 
. |C±|
2 = ⟨l, m|Lˆ 2 − Lˆ 2
z ∓ hLˆ z|l, m⟩ = h2 [
l(l + 1) − m2 ∓ m
]
= h2 [l(l + 1) − m(m ± 1)] . (4.83)124 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions
Using this result in Eq. (4.80) we obtain the following important identity 
.Lˆ ±|l, m⟩ = h
√
l(l + 1) − m(m ± 1)|l, m ± 1⟩. (4.84) 
Equation (4.83) imposes constraints on the possible values of.m and. l. Indeed, if 
.m > l, the quantity 
.l(l + 1) − m(m + 1) < 0, (4.85) 
which is impossible since.|C+|
2 > 0. Similarly, if.m = −|m| < −l, the quantity 
.l(l + 1) − m(m − 1) = l(l + 1) − |m|(|m| + 1) < 0, (4.86) 
which is impossible since.|C−|
2 > 0. Therefore, for a fixed. l,. m must be between. −l
and. l. For.m = l, Eq. (4.84) implies that 
.Lˆ +|l,l⟩ = h
√
l(l + 1) − l(l + 1)|l,l + 1⟩ = |∅⟩. (4.87) 
So, the action of.Lˆ + on.|l,l⟩ does not generate another eigenket, which is consistent 
with the fact that.m cannot exceed. l. Similarly, for.m = −l, Eq. (4.84) implies that 
.Lˆ −|l, −l⟩ = h
√
l(l + 1) + l(−l − 1)|l, −l − 1⟩ = |∅⟩. (4.88) 
So, the action of.Lˆ − on.|l, −l⟩ does not generate another eigenket, which is consistent 
with the fact that. m cannot be less than.−l. Now, if.m = −l is a possible eigenvalue, 
then applying.Lˆ + to.|l, −l⟩ generates a ket proportional to.|l, −l + 1⟩, see Eq. (4.84). 
Applying .Lˆ + to .|l, −l + 1⟩ generates a ket proportional to .|l, −l + 2⟩. Continuing 
to apply.Lˆ +, we must necessarily arrive at the ket.|l,l⟩. Indeed, only in this way can 
the action of.Lˆ + stop, see Eq. (4.88), and thus only in this way can.m not exceed. l. 
This implies that the difference between. l and.−l must necessarily be an integer. k: 
.l − (−l) = 2l = k ⇒ l = k
2
. (4.89) 
We conclude that the possible simultaneous eigenkets of .Lˆ 2 and .Lˆ z are the kets 
.|l, m⟩ where . l is a half-integer, and.m = −l, −l + 1,...,l − 1,l. It is important to 
note that to reach this conclusion, we have exclusively used the commutation rules in 
Eq. (4.64) and not the explicit form of the angular momentum operators in Eq. (4.62). 
As we see in the next sections, in the case of the angular momentum operators in 
Eq. (4.62), we are forced to discard some of the possible eigenvalues found. However, 
the reader should keep in mind that there could be other operators that satisfy the 
same commutation rules in Eq. (4.64) but are not related to the angular momentum. 
If these operators exist (and they do exist) we already know the possible form of their 
eigenvalues and eigenkets.4.7 Angular Momentum in Polar Coordinates 125
4.7 Angular Momentum in Polar Coordinates 
The angular momentum operator is an observable, and like all observables, it acts 
on the Hilbert space.H to which the kets describing our particle in three dimensions 
belong. Given a generic ket .|ψ⟩ ∈ H, we want to learn how to calculate .Lˆi|ψ⟩. 
As done previously with the momentum operator, one possible way to perform this 
calculation is to work in the basis of the position eigenkets. Using Eq. (4.6) and the 
definition of the angular momentum operator.Lˆi in Eq. (4.63), we have

The calculation of the quantity on the right-hand side is particularly simple if we 
work in polar coordinates. These coordinates are particularly convenient when the 
potential energy.V depends only on the magnitude of the vector. r. In such cases, the 
Hamiltonian is invariant under rotations, meaning that.H is written in the same way 
whether we use the coordinates .x, y,z of our system . S or the coordinates . x'
, y'
,z'
of a system .S' arbitrarily rotated with respect to . S, as .|r|=|r'
| and .∇2 = ∇' · ∇'
. 
These types of potentials are called central potentials, and we delve into them later. 
In polar coordinates, every point in space is represented by a vector whose coor￾dinates are not the dot product of the vector with the Cartesian unit vector triad 
.ex , ey , ez but with the polar unit vector triad. er,. eθ, and. eφ. The polar unit vectors are 
mutually orthogonal, just like .ex , ey , ez, but their direction depends on the chosen 
origin, see Fig. 4.1. The radial unit vector .er has the following components in the 
Cartesian coordinate system.x, y,z: 
.er =
⎛
⎝
sin θ cos φ
sin θ sin φ

⎞
⎠ = sin θ cos φ ex + sin θ sin φ ey + cos θez. (4.92) 
The unit vector.eθ can be obtained from the unit vector. er by increasing the angle. θ by 
90. 
◦:.θ → θ + π
2 . The unit vector.eφ can be obtained from the unit vector.er by setting 
.θ = π
2 (the unit vector.eφ is independent of. θ) and then increasing the angle. φ by 90. 
◦: 
.φ → φ + π
2 . Taking into account that.sin (

we have126 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions

The convenience of this reference system is that a generic vector . r with magnitude 
. r can simply be expressed as 
.r = r er. (4.94) 
Now, let us consider the gradient. In Cartesian coordinates, it is 
.∇ = ex
∂
∂x + ey

. (4.95) 
In polar coordinates, we simply need to replace the unit vectors .ex , ey , ez with 
.er, eθ, eφ and then replace the infinitesimal increments .∂x, .∂y, .∂z along the direc￾tions.ex , ey , ez with the infinitesimal increments, which we determine shortly, along 
the directions.er, eθ, eφ. Let.r = rer represent a generic point in space. Following a 
change .∂r in the magnitude . r, a change .∂θ in the angle . θ, and a change .∂φ in the 
angle. φ, the new point, see Fig. 4.1, is located at 
.r' = r + er ∂r + eθ r∂θ + eφ r sin θ∂φ. (4.96) 
So, the infinitesimal increment along .er is .∂r, the infinitesimal increment along . eθ
is.r∂θ, and the infinitesimal increment along.eφ is.r sin θ∂φ. Therefore, the gradient 
in polar coordinates is written as follows:

The other operator whose action we are interested in evaluating is the operator

working in polar coordinates. Taking Eq. (4.91) into account, we have:

4.7.1 Spherical Harmonics 
The purpose of this section is to calculate the eigenfunctions of the angular momen￾tum, i.e., the bracket.⟨r|l, m⟩. Multiplying Eqs. (4.72) on the left by the bra .⟨r| and 
taking into account the previous results, we have

(4.112) 
From all these equations, we immediately see that the radial coordinate. r is a spectator 
variable since only the angles. θ e. φ appear in the differential operators. Let us look 
for a solution of the form: 
.⟨r|l, m⟩ = R(r)Yl,m(θ, φ). (4.113) 
Substituting this form of .⟨r|l, m⟩ into Eqs. (4.110), (4.111), and (4.112), the radial 
function .R(r) simplifies, and we obtain equations for the functions .Yl,m(θ, φ) that 
depend only on the angles:

l(l + 1) − m(m ± 1) Yl,m±1(θ, φ).
(4.116) 
We observe that if .Yl,m(θ, φ) satisfies these equations, then the function .⟨r|l, m⟩ in 
Eq. (4.113) satisfies Eqs. (4.110), (4.111), and (4.112) for any radial function . R. 
This means that there exist infinitely many eigenstates with the same eigenvalues of 
.Lˆ 2 and.Lˆ z in the Hilbert space.H of our particle in three dimensions. To distinguish 
them, we can add an additional index. R to the ket.|l, m⟩, specifying the form of the 
radial function: 
.|l, m⟩→|R,l, m⟩. (4.117) 
The bracket 
.⟨r|R,l, m⟩ = R(r)Yl,m(θ, φ) (4.118) 
yields a radial function characterized by the index . R. The most suitable choice of 
radial functions to form an orthonormal basis on which to expand any wave function 
.ψ(r) depends on the specific problem at hand, and at the moment, it is not of concern 
to us. Therefore, let us assume that we have fixed the radial part of all the brackets 
.⟨r|l, m⟩ and focus on the angular part. In the following we want to find the explicit 
form of the functions.Yl,m(θ, φ), also known as spherical harmonics.130 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions
The solution to Eq. (4.115) is straightforward since the differential operator does 
not depend on . θ, making . θ a spectator variable. Therefore, we seek a solution, as 
already done in Eq. (4.113), that is the product of a function depending on . θ and a 
function depending on. φ: 
.Yl,m(θ, φ) = Θl,m(θ) fm(φ). (4.119) 
Substituting into Eq. (4.115), we see that the function .Θl,m(θ) simplifies, and we 
obtain a differential equation for. fm: 
. − i ∂
∂φ fm(φ) = m fm(φ), (4.120) 
the most general solution of which is 
. fm(φ) = Bmeimφ, (4.121) 
where .Bm is an arbirary complex constant. Note that for . fm(φ) to satisfy . fm(φ) =
fm(φ + 2π), a necessary condition for the continuity of the wave function, the index 
.m cannot be a half-integer. Therefore, among all the possible eigenvalues of.Lˆ 2 and 
.Lˆ z discussed in Eq. (4.89), we must keep only those for which. l is an integer, ensuring 
that. m is automatically an integer. The integer. m of the spherical harmonics is called 
the azimuthal quantum number. 
Now that we have determined the form of. fm, let us move on to determining the 
form of.Θl,m. For.m = l, Eq. (4.116) with the plus sign tells us that: 
.eiφ

Yl,l(θ, φ) = 0. (4.122)

Once .Yl,l is known, we can generate all the other spherical harmonics using 
Eq. (4.116) with the minus sign. For example, we can generate .Y1,0 starting from

A final important observation. The normalization to unity of the spherical har￾monics.Yl,l allows us to derive a relationship of orthonormality among all spherical

4.7.2 Laplacian in Polar Coordinates 
As seen in Eq. (4.16), the Schrödinger equation for a particle in three dimensions 
contains the Laplacian operator. Here, we want to derive the expression of the Lapla￾cian.∇2 in polar coordinates and demonstrate an important relationship between. ∇2
and the differential operator representing .Lˆ 2, see Eq. (4.110). From the expression 
of the gradient in polar coordinates, see Eq. (4.97), we have:

The calculation we need to perform is very similar to the calculation we have already 
carried out to evaluate the action of .Lˆ 2 in Eq. (4.103). Since the polar unit vectors 
do not depend on . r, their derivative with respect to . r is zero. Therefore, using the 
orthogonality between the unit vectors, we obtain a first simplification:

Now let us calculate the derivatives of the radial unit vector with respect to the angles. 
From Eq. (4.92), we have:

4.8 Central Potential 
We consider the Schrödinger equation (4.18), in the case of a central potential. V (r) =

∂2(rϕ(r))
∂r 2 − h2
2mr 2 ∇2
Ωϕ(r) + V(r)ϕ(r) = Eϕ(r). (4.151) 
This is differential equation for an unknown function that depends on . r. We can 
simplify the problem by working in polar coordinates. Let us look for a solution of 
the form 
.ϕ(r) = ⟨r|R,l, m⟩ = R(r)Yl,m(θ, φ). (4.152) 
Taking into account Eq. (4.148), the equation reduces to a differential equation for 
the sole function.R(r):

R(r) = E R(r). (4.153) 
It is interesting to note that we have generated an effective potential 
.Veff(r) = h2l(l + 1)
2mr 2 + V(r) (4.154)4.9 Hydrogen Atom 135
given by the sum of the central potential .V(r) and the centrifugal potential. This 
result is not surprising at all. In fact, the wavefunction in Eq. (4.152) is an eigenfunc￾tion of the angular momentum and therefore describes a particle with a well-defined 
angular momentum. Classically, a particle with angular momentum.hl at a distance 
. r from the origin has a velocity.v = hl
mr and thus a kinetic energy.T = m
2 v2 = h2l
2
2mr 2 . 
Also classically, the centrifugal potential arises from the kinetic energy. The only dif￾ference compared to the classical case is that.l
2 → l(l + 1). However, this difference 
is negligible for very large values of. l, such as those of macroscopic objects. 
The solutions of Eq. (4.153) provide the eigenfunctions of the initial problem once 
the radial function is multiplied by the spherical harmonic.Yl,m. Let us then work on 
this equation. Multiplying it by. r and defining 
.χ(r) = r R(r) (4.155) 
we obtain 
. − h2

∂2χ(r)
∂r 2 +
(h2l(l + 1)

χ(r) = Eχ(r). (4.156) 
This equation needs to be solved for all integer values of . l, and for each . l we find 
a series of eigenvalues .En,l and corresponding eigenfunctions .χn,l . Both the eigen￾values and eigenfunctions depend, of course, on the nature of the central potential 
.V(r). In the next section, we consider the case of the Coulomb potential 
4.9 Hydrogen Atom 
Let us consider an electron with charge .−e immersed in the potential generated by 
a positive charge.Ze located at the origin of the coordinates. The potential energy is 
then the Coulombic one and is given by 
.V(r) = − Ze2
r . (4.157) 
Finding the eigenfunctions of Eq. (4.156) with the central potential in Eq. (4.157) 
means finding the eigenfunctions of an electron in a Hydrogen atom when.Z = 1, in 
a helium ion when .Z = 2, in a lithium dication when .Z = 3, etc. We are therefore 
about to solve a problem of utmost importance since atoms are the building blocks 
of matter, and the Hydrogen atom is the simplest among them. 
In the case of the Coulomb potential energy, the effective potential in Eq. (4.154) 
is given by 
.Veff(r) = h2l(l + 1)
2mer 2 − Ze2
r , (4.158)136 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions
where we denote the electron’s mass as.me. This potential starts from.+∞ at.r = 0, 
decreases as . r increases until it reaches a minimum value .Vmin = − Z2e4me
2h2l(l+1) < 0 at 
.r = h2 Ze2l(l+1)
me , then begins to increase again while remaining negative, and tends to 
zero as.r → ∞. Classically, the electron remains bound if its energy is less than zero. 
Quantum mechanically, if the energy is less than zero, we can have bound states, as 
discussed in Sect. 3.2. We are particularly interested in this occurrence because if the 
theory did not predict bound states, then we would not be able to explain the stability 
of the simplest atom that exists in nature, and all the effort made so far would be in 
vain. We therefore study whether there are solutions with energy.E = −|E| < 0. 
We divide Eq. (4.156) by.|E|: 
. − h2

χ(r) = −χ(r). (4.159) 
To avoid carrying too many constants with us, we define 
.κ2 ≡ 2me|E|
h2 > 0 (4.160) 
and the dimensionless coordinate 
.ρ ≡ κr. (4.161) 
Then Eq. (4.159) becomes 
.

.

χ = 0. (4.164) 
We have thus reduced the problem to finding the values of . α (and therefore of the 
energy) for which Eq. (4.164) admits a solution. χ different from zero. Let us begin by 
getting acquainted with this differential equation, studying how the solution behaves 
in the two limiting cases.ρ → 0 and.ρ → ∞. For.ρ → 0, the dominant contribution in 
parentheses is that of the centrifugal potential, and we can approximate the equation 
as 
.
∂2χ
∂ρ2 − l(l + 1)
ρ2 χ = 0. (4.165)4.9 Hydrogen Atom 137
This is a Euler’s differential equation since if .ρ → λρ, the equation remains 
unchanged. The solutions to the Euler’s equation are functions of the form.χ = ρq . 
It is straightforward to verify that if 
.q(q − 1) − l(l + 1) = 0, (4.166) 
and thus if .q = l + 1 or .q = −l, then .χ = ρq is a solution. Therefore, the most 
general solution as.ρ → 0 is 
.χ = a1ρl+1 + a2ρ−l
, (4.167) 
with.a1 and.a2 arbitrary constants. Remembering that the radial function is. R(r) =
χ/r, see Eq. (4.155), if .a2 were nonzero, then for small . r we would have . R(r) =
a2κ−l
r−l−1, which diverges at the origin for every.l ≥ 0. Divergent functions are not 
continuous; therefore, they do not belong to the Hilbert space and must be discarded. 
We conclude that for small. ρ
.χ = a1ρl+1
. (4.168) 
Now let us consider the other limiting case .ρ → ∞. In this case, the last two terms 
in the parentheses of Eq. (4.164) tend to zero, and the equation can be approximated 
as 
.
∂2χ
∂ρ2 − χ = 0. (4.169) 
whose most general solution is 
.χ = b1eρ + b2e−ρ
. (4.170) 
Again, it is necessary to restrict the generality of this solution because if .b1 were 
nonzero, the wave function would diverge exponentially, and the condition in 
Eq. (4.21) could not be satisfied. We conclude that for large. ρ
.χ = b2e−ρ
. (4.171) 
In light of the asymptotic behaviors just discussed, we look for solutions valid for 
all. ρ having the form

of the second derivative of. χ is easily done138 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions

For this equation to be satisfied, the coefficients of all powers of . ρ must be zero. 
Therefore 
. cq [2(q + l + 1) − α] = cq+1[(q + l + 2)(q + l + 1) − l(l + 1)]
= cq+1[(l + q + 1)(l + 1 + q + 1) − l(l + 1)]

.cq+1 = 2(q + l + 1) − α

which allows for determining all coefficients in terms of. c0. Indeed

c0 = 2(l + 1) − α

c1 = 2(l + 2) − α
2(2l + 3) × 2(l + 1) − α
2(l + 1) c0
... (4.180) 
and so on and so forth. Note that except for . c0, which we can fix later with an 
appropriate normalization, the other coefficients depend on. α, which in turn depends 
on the energy . E, see Eq. (4.163). So, for each energy . E, Eq. (4.179) generates 
coefficients.cq (E), which, when inserted into Eq. (4.172), give rise to a function. χE
and therefore to the radial eigenfunction.RE = χE /r. It remains to be seen whether 
we can accept all these solutions or if some of them should be discarded because 
they do not belong to the Hilbert space. One of the conditions for belonging to the 
Hilbert space is that Eq. (4.21) holds. Let us study the behavior of the function. χ in 
the limit of large. ρ. Let.Q ≫ 1 and separate the expansion in Eq. (4.172) into a sum

(4.183) 
So,. χ diverges exponentially. This means that the radial function.R = χ/r does not 
belong to the Hilbert space! The only way for . χ to belong to the Hilbert space is 
that for some. q the coefficient.cq is zero. In that case, all coefficients.cm with. m > q
would also be zero, and the sum in Eq. (4.172) would terminate at the power .ρq+l
. 
But what conditions must be satisfied for this to happen? From Eq. (4.179), this can 
only occur if. α is an even integer. Let us analyze this fact in detail. Suppose that 
.α = 2n. (4.184) 
In this case, the recursive system for the coefficients.cq becomes 
.cq+1 = 2(q + l + 1 − n)
(q + 1)(q + 2l + 2)
cq . (4.185) 
If the angula moment satisfies 
.l + 1 ≤ n, (4.186) 
we could generate a function. χ whose last coefficient is the one with.q = n − l − 1. 
Conversely, if. α were not an even integer or if.l + 1 were greater than. n, the recursive 
system would not terminate, and the function . χ would diverge exponentially. The 
integer. n is called the principal quantum number. 
In summary, the only radial eigenfunctions that belong to the Hilbert space have 
the form 
.Rn,l(r) = χn,l(r)
r (4.187)4.9 Hydrogen Atom 141
where 
• the principal quantum number .n can take all positive integer values: 
. n = 1, 2,...,∞
• At a fixed . n, the quantum number . l of the angular momentum can take values 
. l = 0, 1,..., n − 1
• .χn,l is the function in Eq. (4.172) whose coefficients satisfy the recursive system 
of Eq. (4.179) with .α = 2n (and therefore all coefficients .cq with . q > n − l − 1
are zero). 
The condition on. α is, in fact, a condition on the possible energies of the Hamiltonian. 
Indeed, imposing that.α = 2n implies, from Eq. (4.163), that only for energies. E =

.2n = 2meZe2

2n2h2 (4.188) 
the Schrödinger equation admits physical solutions .χn,l . The .En are precisely the 
energies of the bound states and are also called the energies of the atomic levels. 
The energy of the ground state is obtained by setting.n = 1 and is given by 
.E1 = −meZ2e4
2h2 = −Z2 × 13.6 eV. (4.189) 
The energies of the bound states .En = E1/n2 are all correctly negative and tend to 
accumulate as. n increases. Furthermore, as in the case of one-dimensional problems, 
they are quantized. In Fig. 4.2, we show the position of the quantized energies (blue 
lines) with respect to the Coulomb potential.−Ze/r (orange line). The eigenfunctions 
of the Hamiltonian with eigenvalue.En are, see Eq. (4.152), 
.ϕn,l,m(r) = Rn,l(r)Yl,m(θ, φ). (4.190) 
These functions are also called orbitals. Since the integer.m can take.2l + 1 values, 
and.l = 0, 1,..., n − 1, the degeneracy.Dn of the eigenvalue.En is 
.Dn = ∑n−1
l=0
(2l + 1) = 2
n(n − 1)
2 + n = n2
. (4.191) 
A note on nomenclature. For small values of the angular momentum. l, it is common 
to alternatively refer to orbitals as . s if .l = 0, . p if .l = 1, . d if .l = 2, and . f if .l = 3. 
Therefore, the ground state of the Hydrogen atom is also called the .1s state, the 
bound states of the second level are called.2s and.2p states, those of the third level 
are called. 3s,.3p, and.3d states, and so on. 
The results obtained in this section are of extraordinary importance. They demon￾strate that quantum mechanics is capable of explaining one of the greatest myster-142 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions

energy levels (eigenvalues) 
ies of the universe, namely the stability of matter. Before the advent of quantum 
mechanics, it was not possible to explain even the stability of a simple system like 
the Hydrogen atom. Classically, the electron could not orbit indefinitely around the 
nucleus. Being a charged particle, it would radiate light due to its accelerated motion. 
Radiating light, it would lose energy until collapsing onto the nucleus. The quantum 
view of the universe does not use position and momentum to describe particles but 
wavefunctions. And if the electron is in an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian, then 
the mean values of all observables are independent of time, see the discussion under 
Eq. (1.153). Therefore, everything is stationary, and there can be no radiation.

4.9.2 Radial Functions 
We now want to take a closer look at the radial functions of the first atomic levels.

Note that the coefficients .cq depend on . n and . l since they are determined by the 
recursive system in Eq. (4.185), where both. l and. n appear. Similarly, the coefficient 
. κ depends on. n as it is expressed in terms of.E = En, thus

Since . κ appears in the exponential of the radial function, the Bohr radius gives 
us an estimate of how extended the radial function is. It is also observed that as 
. n increases, and consequently, as the energy increases, the quantity . κ decreases. 
This means that with increasing energy, the radial functions become more and more 
extended. Particularly transparent is the expression of atomic levels’ energy in terms 
of the Bohr radius144 4 Quantum Particle in Three Dimensions

So, the radial function of the ground state is a simple exponential, see Fig. 4.3. 
We now consider the principal quantum number.n = 2. In this case, we can have 
.l = 0 or.l = 1. For.l = 0, the recursive system provides 
.c1 = 2 − 4

Note that this radial function has a zero at .r = 2aB/Z. This means that there is a 
special distance from the origin where the probability of finding the electron is zero, 
see Fig. 4.3. For.l = 1, the only nonzero coefficient is the first one, and therefore4.10 Exercises 145

most general solution is .vx (t) = α cos Ωt + β sin Ωt and taking account that 
.vx (0) = 0 it must be.α = 0. To calculate. β it is necessary to determine. v˙x (0) =
x¨(0) = ωB y˙(0) − ω2x(0) = −ω2

Since both the kinetic and potential parts commute with.Lˆ z we have.[Hˆ , Lˆ z] = 0.

In this section, we discover that elementary particles, such as electrons or quarks, 
possess internal degrees of freedom. In other words, a wavefunction alone is no 
longer sufficient to describe them. 
Let us consider again the hydrogen atom (.Z = 1) from the previous chapter and 
immerse it in a spatially uniform magnetic field. B. As we know, due to the presence 
of the magnetic field, the Hamiltonian changes. In Eq. (4.60), we precisely derived

E|E, k⟩ with.φ(r) = e/r being the Coulomb (central) potential,.Q = −e the charge 
of the electron, and .m = me the electron’s mass. For a sufficiently small magnetic

Let us choose the magnetic field oriented along the. z direction:.B = (0, 0, B). In this 
case, the dot product.Lˆ · B = BLˆ z. Multiplying Eq. (5.2) by the bra.⟨r| and expressing 
the Laplacian in polar coordinates, see Eq. (4.150), we obtain the eigenvalue equation 
for the wave function.ϕE,k (r) = ⟨r|E, k⟩:

ϕE,k (r) = EϕE,k (r). (5.4) 
In obtaining this equation, we also use Eq. (4.102). If the magnetic field were zero, 
this would be precisely the eigenvalue equation for the hydrogen atom, which, as 
we know from Sect. 4.9, has eigenvalues .En = −e2/(2aBn2) and eigenfunctions 
.ϕn,l,m(r):

ϕn,l,m(r) = Enϕn,l,m(r). (5.5) 
Now, the point is that the functions .ϕn,l,m(r) = Rn,l(r)Yl,m(θ, φ) continue to be 
eigenfunctions even in the presence of the magnetic field, as, according to Eq. (4.115),

Therefore, a weak uniform magnetic field does not change the eigenfunctions. ϕn,l,m
of the hydrogen atom but alters the associated eigenvalues. The new eigenvalues are, 
in fact, 
.E˜n,m = En + ehB

and depend not only on the principal quantum number . n but also on the azimuthal 
quantum number. m. This result can be derived in a couple of lines without resorting 
to the position representation. Let.|n,l, m⟩ be the ket whose inner product with the 
bra.⟨r| yields the eigenfunction of the hydrogen atom 
.ϕn,l,m(r) = ⟨r|n,l, m⟩. (5.9) 
The kets.|n,l, m⟩ are therefore the eigenkets of.Hˆ0 in Eq. (5.3) 
.Hˆ0|n,l, m⟩ = En|n,l, m⟩. (5.10)5.1 Spin 155
The reader can easily verify that by multiplying this equation by the bra .⟨r|, we 
recover Eq. (5.5). They are also eigenkets of.Lˆ z with eigenvalue.hm. Therefore

It is straightforward to verify that by multiplying this equation by the bra .⟨r|, we 
recover Eq. (5.7). 
The quantity 
.μB ≡ eh
2mec = 5.788 × 10−5 eV/T (5.12) 
is called the Bohr magneton and has the physical dimensions of a magnetic moment. 
The correction to the energies of the hydrogen atom is, therefore, very transparent. 
Classically, a magnetic moment .μ in a magnetic field .B has an energy equal to 
.−μ · B. If the magnetic moment is generated by a loop of radius. r located in the. xy
plane and carrying a current . I, then .μ = (0, 0, μ) is directed along the . z axis and, 
along this axis, has a projection 
.μ = Iπr 2
c . (5.13) 
If there is only one electron moving at a speed . v in the loop, then the current it 
generates is 
.I = − ev
2πr
. (5.14) 
Substituting this expression into Eq. (5.13), we find the magnetic moment associated 
with an electron moving in a circular trajectory 
.μ = −erv
2c = − eLz
2mec
, (5.15) 
where .Lz = merv is the angular momentum of the electron. If the value of this 
angular momentum is.Lz = hm, then the magnetic moment of the loop becomes 
.μ = − ehm
2mec = −μBm (5.16) 
and the classical energy.−μB precisely coincides with the second term of Eq. (5.8). 
The energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom can be experimentally measured. 
By conducting the experiment in the presence of a uniform magnetic field, we can 
verify whether the theoretical prediction is in agreement with the experiment. What 
happens is that there is a discrepancy. In particular, the theory predicts that if the 
electron is in the ground state .|1, 0, 0⟩ in the absence of a magnetic field, then as156 5 Spin and Addition of Angular Momenta

.B increases, its energy remains the same since, according to Eq. (5.8), . E˜1,0 = E1
is independent of . B. Experimentally, however, it is found that as .B increases, the 
energy level splits into two energy levels 
.E+ = E1 + μB B, E− = E1 − μB B (5.17) 
What is happening? It is happening that the quantum numbers . (n,l, m) = (1, 0, 0)
are not sufficient to uniquely determine the state in which the electron can be found. 
Indeed, let us recall that according to the second postulate, if we measured.E+ then 
the electron would collapse into a state which, according to the third postulate, is 
orthogonal to the state in which it would collapse if we measured.E− (the eigenkets 
of an observable, such as the Hamiltonian, are mutually orthogonal if the associated 
eigenvalues are distinct). As often happens in the quantum world, the strangeness 
does not end here. Suppose we orient the magnetic field along . x. Obviously, the 
. z direction is nothing special, so if we repeated the same experiment, we would 
still measure the energies.E+ and.E−. However, this time, the states into which the 
electron collapses are not the same as before! In fact, what is experimentally found 
is that if we measure, for example,.E+ and then suddenly change the orientation of 
the magnetic field from the. x axis to the. z axis, see Fig. 5.1, then a subsequent energy 
measurement would yield the value .E+ with a probability of.1/2 and the value . E−
with a probability of .1/2. From other experiments of this kind, it has been realized 
that the electron possesses, in addition to the “spatial” degrees of freedom, also an 
internal degree of freedom. Furthermore, it has been understood that all experimental 
results can be explained by adding, “by hand”, to the Hamiltonian .Hˆ0 an operator 
that acts exclusively on the internal degree of freedom. 1
The operator to be added “by hand” is the following
1 The term that we will add"by hand" actually comes from an even more fundamental equation than 
Schrödinger’s, which we do not have the opportunity to address in this book. 5.1 Spin 157

compare with Eq. (4.66). Moreover, the only possible eigenvalue of the square opera￾tor.Sˆ2 is.h23/4 = h2 1
2 ( 1
2 + 1). Therefore, the internal degree of freedom is quantized 
and exists in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. In fact, for eigenvalues of.Sˆ2 equal to 
.h23/4, we have denoted with.| 1

2 ⟩ and.| 1
2 , −1
2 ⟩ the only two simultaneous eigenkets 
of .Sˆ2 and . Sˆz, see Sect. 4.6. However, since the electron also has spatial degrees of 
freedom, we necessarily need to complicate the notation. For example, we can denote 
with 
.|r;

the state into which the electron collapses when a position measurement yields. r and 
a measurement of.Sˆz yields.hms. Similarly, we can indicate with 
.|n,l, m;

, ms⟩, (5.21) 
the state into which the electron collapses when an energy measurement yields.En, 
a measurement of.Lˆ 2 yields.h2l(l + 1), a measurement of.Lˆ z yields.hm, and a mea￾surement of.Sˆz yields.hms. The operators. Sˆ
i , called spin operators, act only on the 
index .ms, while the “spatial” operators such as . rˆ, . pˆ, . Lˆ act, as before, only on the 
indices.n,l, m. Particles with internal degrees of freedom like the electron are called 
particles with spin. s, where. s refers to the half-integer eigenvalue.h2s(s + 1) of. Sˆ2. 
In the case of the electron,.s = 1
2 , and thus, the electron is a spin-1/2 particle. 
Let us see how adding the term in Eq. (5.18) allows us to explain the experimental 
results. The new Hamiltonian is the sum of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (5.2) and the new 
term in Eq. (5.18): 
.Hˆ = Hˆ0 + e

B·Lˆ + e

Now let us consider the magnetic field directed along the. z axis. Then.B · Sˆ = BSˆz.

.Sˆz|1, 0, 0;

we see that the ket.|1, 0, 0; 1

.E1 + eh

ms B = E1 + 2μBms B. (5.25) 
So for .ms = 1
2 we find the eigenvalue .E+ = E1 + μB B while for .ms = −1
2 we 
find the eigenvalue .E− = E1 − μB B, in accordance with the experimental result. 
Now, let’s orient the magnetic field along the. x axis, so.B · Sˆ = BSˆx . For notational 
simplicity, we omit writing the triplet .1, 0, 0 since it plays no role in the following 
considerations. Therefore, we write .| 1
2 , ms⟩ but understand the ket .|1, 0, 0; 1
2 , ms⟩. 
It is easy to verify that the eigenkets.Sˆx are

The only measurable energies are then .E+ and .E−, again in accordance with the 
experiment. Suppose we have measured.E+ and that the electron has collapsed into 
the state .|ψx,+⟩. If we suddenly change the orientation of the magnetic field from 
the .x-axis to the .z-axis, then, according to the fourth postulate, the probability of

discussed below Eq. (5.25). Taking into account Eq. (5.26), one finds immediately

once again, in accordance with the experiment. We leave it to the reader to verify 
that the probability of measuring energy.E− is also the same as in the experiment. 
5.2 Matrix Representation of Spin Operators 
As mentioned in the previous section, elementary particles are characterized by 
degrees of freedom associated with spin. A basis for the Hilbert space for particles 
with spin . s could be the set of kets .|r;s, ms⟩ or the set of kets .|p;s, ms⟩. More 
generally, denoting.|bk ⟩ as the ket of a generic orthonormal basis for the spatial part, 
the set of kets .|bk ;s, ms⟩ forms a basis for our Hilbert space. The inner product 
between two kets in this basis is 
.⟨bk ;s, ms|bk';s, m'
s⟩=⟨bk |bk'⟩⟨s, ms|s, m'
s⟩ = δk,k'δms,m'
s . (5.31) 
It is also useful to define a partial inner product between a ket from the spatial or 
spin part and a ket from the new Hilbert space: 
.⟨bk |bk';s, m'
s⟩≡⟨bk |bk'⟩|s, m'
s⟩ = δk,k'|s, m'
s⟩⇒⟨bk';s, m'
s|bk ⟩ = δk,k'⟨s, m'
s| (5.32) 
. ⟨s, ms|bk';s, m'
s⟩≡⟨s, ms|s, m'
s⟩|bk'⟩ = δms,m'
s |bk'⟩⇒⟨bk';s, m'
s|s, ms⟩ = δms,m'
s ⟨bk'|
(5.33) 
So the partial scalar product does not return a complex number but a ket (or a bra) 
of the spatial or spin part. 
The spatial operators such as. rˆ or. pˆ or. Lˆ , or even more exotic ones like.rˆ, pˆ 3Lˆ 2, 
act only on.bk (with.ms being mere spectators). On the other hand, the spin operators 
such as.Sˆ
i or. Sˆ2, or even more exotic ones like.Sˆ2
x Sˆ3
z , act only on.ms (with.bk being 
mere spectators). Therefore, the action of a generic spatial operator.Oˆ (space) is given 
by

Since spatial operators and spin operators act on different degrees of freedom, they 
commute with each other 
.
[

We can easily verify this fact by taking the bracket between a generic bra. ⟨bk';s, m'

Since the matrix elements are simple complex numbers, the quantity in parentheses 
is zero. 
From Eq. (5.36), we see that to determine the action of a spin operator, we can 
ignore the spatial part of the ket since the matrix element.O(spin)
m'
sms is the same for all. bk . 
In the following, for notational convenience, we simply write .|s, ms⟩, but we mean 
.|bk ;s, ms⟩ with.bk fixed and.ms varying between.−s and. s. Our goal is to determine 
the matrix representation of spin operators in the .|s, ms⟩ basis, see Sect. 2.1. Since 
this is an orthonormal basis, from Eq. (4.72), it is immediately verified that the 
matrices.S2 and.Sz are diagonal 
.S2
m'
s,ms = δm'
s,msh2
s(s + 1), Sz,m'
s,ms = δm'

In particular, the matrix.S2 is proportional to the identity matrix with a proportionality 
coefficient of.h2s(s + 1). To obtain the representation.Sx and.Sy of the operators. Sˆx
and. Sˆy , we begin by observing that from Eq. (4.74), it follows that 
.Sˆx = 1

(5.46) 
The matrices.Sx and.Sy in the.|s, ms⟩ basis have non-zero elements only above and 
below the diagonal. Let us have a look at a couple of examples. 
5.2.1 Spin .1/2 and Spin . 1

So, the spin matrices for .s = 1/2 are proportional to the Pauli matrices introduced 
in Sect. 2.2: 
.Si = h

We can recycle some results. In particular, since the eigenvalues of. n · σ = nxσx +
nyσy + nzσz are .±1, then the eigenvalues of .nxSx + nySy + nzSz = h
2 (n · σ) are 
.±h/2 with eigenvectors given by Eq. (2.26). Setting .ϕ = 0 and .θ = π/2, we find,

5.3 Spin-Orbit Interaction 
Now that we understand that the electron is a particle with spin.s = 1/2, let us return 
once again to the hydrogen atom. Suppose the electron is at an average distance . r
from the proton with angular momentum directed along the.z-axis. In the electron’s 
reference frame, we would see the proton orbiting around the electron at an average 
distance . r with angular momentum directed along the .z-axis. Since the proton is 
a particle with charge . e, it generates a current and therefore a magnetic field that, 
according to what we have seen in Eq. (5.18), couples to the electron’s spin. Therefore, 
the Hamiltonian.Hˆ0 in Eq. (5.3) is incomplete because it does not take into account the 
fact that, even in the absence of external magnetic fields, there is still the magnetic 
field generated by the proton. To correct this deficiency, we need to evaluate the 
protonic magnetic field. It coincides with the field found at the center of a loop of 
radius . r lying in the .xy plane with a current flowing through it: .I = ev/(2πr), see 
Eq. (5.14) and Fig. 5.2. From the law of Laplace,

the form of the interaction between the electron’s spin and its angular momentum. It 
is sufficient to say here that the result of the correct derivation differs from ours only 
by a factor of.1/2. The correct operator to add to the Hamiltonian.Hˆ0 of Eq. (5.3) is

How to determine the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.Hˆ0 + HˆSO? The problem 
could easily reduce to a radial part problem only if the kets .|R,l, m; 1

radial part since the operator.Lˆ · Sˆ does not contain any dependence on. rˆ. If Eq. (5.61)

and any ket that is an eigenket of.Lˆ 2 and .Lˆ z, such as the ket .|R,l, m⟩, is the spher￾ical harmonic .Yl,m(θ, φ). In other words, .⟨r|R,l, m⟩ = R(r)Yl,m(θ, φ), as seen in 
Eq. (4.152). Taking into account that.⟨r|(1/rˆ3) = ⟨r|(1/r 3), we find

the radial part only, just like in the case analyzed in Sect. 4.9. Solving this equation 
would then be possible to obtain the eigenvalues.E in Eq. (5.63). 
Unfortunately, this entire story is to be discarded. Indeed, Eq. (5.61) is incorrect. 
Convincing ourselves of this is quite straightforward. Let us express the dot product

− results in a ket with .m increased by

2 , ms⟩ are only 
eigenkets of.Lˆ z Sˆz with eigenvalue.h2mms but not eigenkets of the dot product.Lˆ · Sˆ. 
So, who are the eigenkets of.Lˆ · Sˆ ?166 5 Spin and Addition of Angular Momenta
5.4 Addition of Angular Momenta 
In this section, we address the question posed at the end of the previous section. To 
simplify notation, we omit writing the radial index . n since it is a mere spectator, 
meaning it never changes under the action of angular momentum and spin operators. 
We write.|l, m;s, ms⟩ but understand it as.|n,l, m;s, ms⟩. Additionally, we solve the 
problem for a general. s since the form of the spin-orbit interaction often appears in 
physics and is not limited to particles with.s = 1/2. 
We begin by recalling that the ket .|l, m;s, ms⟩ is the state in which the electron 
collapses when a measurement of .Lˆ 2 yields the value .h2l(l + 1), a measurement 
of .Lˆ z yields the value .hm, a measurement of .Sˆ2 yields the value .h2s(s + 1), and 
a measurement of .Sˆz yields the value .hms. The operators .Lˆ 2, .Lˆ z, . Sˆ2, and .Sˆz all 
commute with each other, and the set of kets.|l, m;s, ms⟩ forms their common basis 
of eigenvectors, as discussed in point (6) of Sect. 1.9. Now, let us consider the total 
angular momentum operator: 
.Jˆ = Lˆ + Sˆ, (5.68) 
whose square is (remember that a spatial operator always commutes with a spin 
operator) 
.Jˆ2 = Lˆ 2 + Sˆ2 + 2Lˆ · Sˆ (5.69) 
It is straightforward to show that the components of. Jˆ satisfy the same commutation 
rules as the angular momentum: 
.[Jˆ
i, Jˆ
j]=[Lˆi, Lˆ j]+[Sˆ
i, Sˆj] = ih
∑
k
εijk (Lˆ k + Sˆ
k ) = ih
∑
k
εijk Jˆ
k . (5.70) 
Therefore, .Jˆ2 has eigenvalues .h2 j(j + 1) and .Jˆ
z has eigenvalues .hm j with . m j =
− j,..., j. Moreover, both .Lˆ 2 and .Sˆ2 commute, not only with each other but also 
with.Jˆ
z and.Jˆ2. We leave this simple verification to the reader. Thus, in addition to the 
basis.|l, m;s, ms⟩, we could consider the basis consisting of the common eigenkets 
of the operators .Jˆ2, . Jˆ
z, .Lˆ 2, and . Sˆ2. Let .| j, m j⟩ls denote the kets of this basis. We 
then have: 
. Jˆ2
| j, m j⟩ls = h2 j(j + 1)| j, m j⟩ls
Jˆ
z| j, m j⟩ls = hm j| j, m j⟩ls
Lˆ 2
| j, m j⟩ls = h2
l(l + 1)| j, m j⟩ls
Sˆ2
| j, m j⟩ls = h2
s(s + 1)| j, m j⟩ls (5.71) 
The advantage of working with this new basis is that the kets.| j, m j⟩ls are precisely 
the eigenkets of.Lˆ · Sˆ. In fact, from Eq. (5.69), we have5.4 Addition of Angular Momenta 167
.Lˆ · Sˆ = 1
2
(Jˆ2 − Lˆ 2 − Sˆ2
), (5.72) 
and hence 
.Lˆ · Sˆ| j, m j⟩ls = h2
2 (j(j + 1) − l(l + 1) − s(s + 1))| j, m j⟩ls. (5.73) 
The new kets.| j, m j⟩ls must be expressible as linear combinations of the old kets 
.|l, m;s, ms⟩ (forming the latter a basis). In the remainder of this section, we find the 
possible values of . j and how to express the new kets in terms of the old ones. We 
then learn about the addition of angular momenta. Let us start by noting that all 
kets in the old basis are eigenkets of.Lˆ 2 with the same eigenvalue.h2l(l + 1) and of 
.Sˆ2 with the same eigenvalue.h2s(s + 1). Therefore, any linear combination of them 
automatically satisfies the last two relations in Eq. (5.71). Furthermore, the old kets 
are also eigenkets of.Jˆ
z since 
.Jˆ
z|l, m;s, ms⟩ = (Lˆ z + Sˆz)|l, m;s, ms⟩ = h(m + ms)|l, m;s, ms⟩. (5.74) 
It follows that the kets of the new basis must be linear combinations of the kets of the 
old basis with the same value of the sum.m + ms. Indeed, if we were to mix kets from 
the old basis with different values of.m + ms, we could not generate an eigenket of 
. Jˆ
z. Having denoted.hm j as the eigenvalues of. Jˆ
z, we can then write: 
.| j, m j⟩ls = ∑
m,ms:m+ms=m j
C(j) m,ms
|l, m;s, ms⟩. (5.75) 
The reader can easily convince themselves that regardless of the coefficients.C(j) m,ms, 
this is an eigenket of .Jˆ
z with eigenvalue .hm j (and obviously also of .Lˆ 2 and . Sˆ2
with eigenvalues .h2l(l + 1) and .h2s(s + 1) respectively). It is necessary, therefore, 
to determine the coefficients .C(j) m,ms so that the ket in Eq. (5.75) is also an eigenket 
of .Jˆ2. To this end, we observe that the maximum possible value of .m j is the sum 
of the maximum possible values of .m and .ms, i.e., .m = l and .ms = s. Since there 
is only one ket in the old basis for which .m + ms = l + s, the linear combination 
in Eq. (5.75) consists of the sole ket .|l,l;s,s⟩. This must also be a ket in the new 
basis with .m j = l + s. But to which value of . j does it correspond? Since .m j can 
vary between.− j and. j, and it is not possible to construct kets with.m j greater than 
.l + s, we deduce that. j = l + s. This is also the maximum value that. j can assume, 
as if it were not the case, it would be possible to construct states with .m j > l + s, 
which is absurd. Thus, we have established that 
.|l + s,l + s⟩ls = |l,l;s,s⟩. (5.76)168 5 Spin and Addition of Angular Momenta
We can immediately generate a second eigenket of the new basis by applying the 
operator

√(l + s)(l + s + 1) − (l + s)(l + s − 1)
|l,l;s,s − 1⟩. (5.79) 
Correctly, the ket.|l + s,l + s − 1⟩ls in Eq. (5.79), which by construction is an eigen￾ket of .Jˆ
z with eigenvalue .h(l + s − 1), is a linear combination of the only two kets 
in the old basis for which .m + ms = l + s − 1, see Eq. (5.75). By applying the 
operator .Jˆ
− on the left and .Lˆ − + Sˆ
− on the right in Eq. (5.79), we obtain the ket 
.|l + s,l + s − 2⟩ls of the new basis written in terms of kets from the old basis. Contin￾uing to apply the operator.Jˆ
− on the left and.Lˆ − + Sˆ
− on the right generates kets of the 
new basis with decreasing values of.m j , that is, with.m j = l + s − 3,l + s − 4, etc., 
until reaching.m j = −l − s. At this point, as we know from the theory in Sect. 4.6, 
the application of .Jˆ
− to the ket .|l + s, −l − s⟩ls produces the null ket, and thus the 
algorithm terminates. 
We have thus found a total of .2(l + s) + 1 kets of the new basis with . j = l + s
and .m j = −l − s,...,l + s. We say that all these kets belong to the “chain” with 
. j = l + s, see Fig. 5.3. Obviously, there must be other kets in the new basis since 
the total number of kets in the old basis is.(2l + 1)(2s + 1) > 2(l + s) + 1. To find 
them, let us make the following consideration. Using the only two kets of the old basis 
with.m + ms = l + s − 1, we can only make an orthonormal linear combination to 
that in Eq. (5.79). It is obtained by exchanging the coefficients and changing the sign 
of one of the two coefficients. Indeed, if .|ψ1⟩ and .|ψ2⟩ are two orthonormal kets, 
which are the two kets of the linear combination in Eq. (5.79), and if we consider the 
linear combination.α|ψ1⟩ + β|ψ2⟩ with.|α|
2 + |β|
2 = 1, then the linear combination 
.β|ψ1⟩ − α|ψ2⟩ is orthogonal to the first one and normalized to one. The orthonormal 
linear combination to that of Eq. (5.79) must necessarily be a ket of the new basis 
because:5.4 Addition of Angular Momenta 169
(1) The kets of the new basis are orthonormal to each other, and 
(2) The kets of the new basis must have the fixed sum.m + ms. 
In general, these two conditions are necessary but not sufficient to ensure that a 
ket belongs to the new basis. However, in the case we are examining, they are also 
sufficient because there is only one linear combination of the kets of the old basis that 
is orthogonal to that of Eq. (5.79) and at the same time has.m j = m + ms = l + s − 1. 
To which value of. j does this new ket correspond? As we have said,. j can at most 
be .l + s, and since .m j = l + s − 1, it could be either . j = l + s or . j = l + s − 1
(remember once again that .m j cannot be greater than . j). If . j were equal to .l + s, 
it would be possible to generate, by applying .Jˆ
+ = Lˆ + + Sˆ
+, a second ket beyond 
the one in Eq. (5.76), with. j = l + s and.m j = l + s. However, this is absurd since 
there is only one ket with such quantum numbers. We conclude that. j = l + s − 1. 
Inverting the coefficients of the linear combination in Eq. (5.79) and changing the 
sign of one of them, we can then write that 
. |l + s − 1,l + s − 1⟩ls =
√s(s + 1) − s(s − 1)
√(l + s)(l + s + 1) − (l + s)(l + s − 1)

−
√l(l + 1) − l(l − 1)
√(l + s)(l + s + 1) − (l + s)(l + s − 1)
|l,l;s,s − 1⟩, (5.80) 
We can now proceed as before to recursively determine all the kets in the chain 
with . j = l + s − 1, see Fig. 5.3. It is sufficient to apply the operator .Jˆ
− on the 
left and .Lˆ − + Sˆ
− on the right to obtain all the kets .|l + s − 1, m j⟩ls with . m j =
l + s − 2,l + s − 3,..., −l − s + 1, for a total of.2(l + s − 1) + 1 kets. 
Now let us consider the kets .|l + s,l + s − 2⟩ls (the third ket in the chain with 
. j = l + s) and .|l + s − 1,l + s − 2⟩ls (the second ket in the chain with . j = l +
s − 1), see Fig. 5.3. They have the same .m j = l + s − 2, and therefore, they are 
linear combinations of the old kets with .m + ms = l + s − 2. Of these old kets, 
there can be at most three, as we can have.m = l and.ms = s − 2 or.m = l − 1 and 
.ms = s − 1 or.m = l − 2 and.ms = s. Therefore, the two new kets. |l + s,l + s − 2⟩ls
and .|l + s − 1,l + s − 2⟩ls are linear combinations of these three old kets. With 
these three old kets, we can then construct a single orthonormal linear combination 
of the new kets.|l + s,l + s − 2⟩ls and.|l + s − 1,l + s − 2⟩ls. For the same reasons 
as before, this linear combination must be a ket of the new basis, and since there 
cannot be more than two kets with.m j = l + s − 1, it must belong to the chain with 
. j = l + s − 2. Thus, we obtain the ket .|l + s − 2,l + s − 2⟩ls from which we can 
generate all the kets in the chain with. j = l + s − 2 by applying the operator.Jˆ
− on 
the right and.Lˆ − + Sˆ
− on the left. 
Continuing with the algorithm just described, it is possible to construct the ket 
.|l + s − 3,l + s − 3⟩ls, from which all the kets in the chain with. j = l + s − 3 can 
be generated. Then, the ket .|l + s − 4,l + s − 4⟩ls can be constructed, from which 
all the kets in the chain with. j = l + s − 4 can be generated, and so on. When does 
this procedure end? Finding the answer is rather straightforward. The chain with a 
certain . j contains .2 j + 1 kets, and the possible values of . j are, as we have seen,170 5 Spin and Addition of Angular Momenta
Fig. 5.3 Struttura degli autokets del momento angolare totale. Essi formano delle “catene” carat￾terizzate da valori diversi di. j. I valori di. j vanno da un massimo di.l + s a un minimo di. |l − s|
.l + s,l + s − 1,l + s − 2, etc. Since the number of kets in the old basis and the new 
basis is the same, there must necessarily exist a minimum value of . j, let us call it 
. jmin, that guarantees this. Remembering that the number of kets in the old basis is 
.(2l + 1)(2s + 1) and that a chain with a given. j consists of.(2 j + 1) kets, the value 
of. jmin must be such that

2 (5.83) 
and since. jmin ≥ 0, we conclude that 
. jmin = |l − s|. (5.84) 
In Fig. 5.3, we show the structure of the new basis. 
The result regarding the possible values of . j is quite intuitive to remember. The 
total angular momentum is the sum of two vectors. Classically, if we denote.hl and 
.hs as the lengths of these two vectors, then the maximum possible length of their sum 
is achieved when the two vectors are parallel, and it is.h(l + s), while the minimum 
possible length of the sum is achieved when the two vectors are antiparallel, and it 
is.h|l − s|. 
Finally, it is worth noting that the theory of addition of angular momenta is entirely 
general and not limited to cases involving the angular momentum operators . Lˆ and 
spin. Sˆ. For example, in systems with two particles, there might be a convenience in 
working in the basis of the total angular momentum.Lˆ tot = Lˆ 1 + Lˆ 2. All the previous 
results still apply; one just needs to identify. Jˆ with.Lˆ tot,. Lˆ with.Lˆ 1, and. Sˆ with.Lˆ 2. 
5.4.1 Hydrogen Atom with Spin-Orbit Interaction 
We can use what we have just learned to calculate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions 
of the Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom with spin-orbit interaction. It is possible 
to reduce the general problem to an eigenvalue equation for the radial part only. If 
we reintroduce the principal quantum number into the eigenkets.| j, m j⟩ls, we have, 
according to Eq. (5.73), 
.Lˆ · Sˆ|n, j, m j⟩ls = h2
2 (j(j + 1) − l(l + 1) − s(s + 1))|n, j, m j⟩ls . (5.85)

Let us show that it is possible to choose the kets.|R, j, m j⟩ls in such a way that they 
satisfy the eigenvalue equation 
.(Hˆ0 + HˆSO)|R, j, m j⟩ls = E|R, j, m j⟩ls. (5.88)

We have therefore reduced the original problem to an eigenvalue problem for the 
radial part only, to be solved for every possible value of . j, . l, and . s. In our case, 
.s = 1/2 is the only possible value, as the electron is a spin-.1/2 particle. So, for 
.l = 0, we can only have. j = 1/2, while for.l > 0, we can have both. j = l − 1/2 and 
. j = l + 1/2. The radial eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues depend 
on a principal quantum number, let us call it . Q, as well as .j and . l. Once the radial 
function .RQ,j,l(r) with eigenvalue .EQ,j,l is known, we can construct the eigenkets 
of the entire Hamiltonian .Hˆ0 + HˆSO. It is sufficient to calculate the coefficients . Rn
in Eq. (5.86). This means that we need to calculate5.4 Addition of Angular Momenta 173

5.4.2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian for Magnetic Systems 
Crystals are physical structures characterized by a unit cell that repeats periodically 
in space, and within which there is a finite number of atoms positioned in the same 
way. Crystals can be characterized based on their electronic properties, such as con￾ductivity, optical properties, such as their color, and magnetic properties. Regarding 
the latter, they emerge, for example, in crystals where the number of electrons in each 
cell is odd, and therefore, each cell has an effective spin different from zero. The 
magnetism in these materials is essentially due to the fact that the spin of one cell 
interacts with the spin of the neighboring cell, and the energy associated with this 
interaction is minimized when the spins are aligned. The Hamiltonian that governs 
the spins of the cells is called the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and it has the following 
mathematical form: 
.Hˆ = ∑
i j
Ji j Sˆi · Sˆ j (5.93) 
where .Sˆi is the spin operator of the .i-th cell, and .Ji j are coupling constants (they 
have nothing to do with the total angular momentum studied earlier). Let us see how 
the theory of addition of angular momenta helps us in understanding magnetism in 
materials. 
Suppose, for simplicity, that we have only two cells, and denote by.Sˆ 1 and.Sˆ 2 the 
spins of these cells. Then the Hamiltonian becomes: 
.Hˆ = J Sˆ 1 · Sˆ 1, (5.94) 
where we define the coupling constant.J ≡ J12. Introducing the operator of the total 
spin: 
.Sˆ = Sˆ 1 + Sˆ 1 (5.95) 
we can rewrite the Hamiltonian using Eq. (5.72) as follows: 
.Hˆ = J
2
(Sˆ2 − Sˆ2
1 − Sˆ2
2 ). (5.96) 
If the spins of both cells are 1/2, then the possible values of the total spin are. s = 1
or.s = 0, and the eigenvalues of.Hˆ are:174 5 Spin and Addition of Angular Momenta
.Es = Jh2

s(s + 1) − 3

)
. (5.97) 
In the case where .J < 0, we see that the lowest energy is achieved for .s = 1, and 
the corresponding eigenkets of the Hamiltonian are

how the Heisenberg interaction favors a certain alignment of spins and, therefore, 
magnetism.

eigenvalues.h2l(l + 1) and.hml , and of the spin operators.Sˆ2 and.Sˆz with eigen￾values.h2s(s + 1) and.hms (for the hypothesis.s = 1/2). Said.Jˆ = Lˆ + Sˆ is the

the value of . j can be obtained both with .l = 1 and with .l = 2. So the most

Approximation Methods 
The problems that can be exactly solved in quantum mechanics can be counted on 
the fingers of one hand. They include problems with piecewise constant potentials, 
the harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, and a few others. By “exactly solving a 
problem” here, we mean the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian operator, i.e., 
the calculation of its eigenvalues and eigenkets. In the vast majority of cases, exact 
diagonalization is extremely complicated. In this chapter, we see how to approach 
these cases using methods that allow us to approximate the exact solution. 
6.1 Perturbation Theory: Correction to Energy Levels 
Often, we encounter problems in which the Hamiltonian.Hˆ is the sum of an operator 
.Hˆ0 that we know how to exactly diagonalize and another operator . Pˆ, called the 
perturbation, which produces small corrections to the eigenvalues and eigenkets of 
.Hˆ0: 
.Hˆ = Hˆ0 + Pˆ. (6.1) 
In such cases, it is possible to develop a method that allows us to calculate perturba￾tively the corrections due to the operator. Pˆ. In this chapter, we focus on developing 
such a method. Although we work to correct the eigenvalues and eigenkets of .Hˆ0, 
the method is applicable in other contexts. If we are interested in diagonalizing the 
operator.Cˆ = Aˆ + Bˆ and know the eigenvalues and eigenkets of. Aˆ, we can calculate 
the corrections due to .Bˆ by simply replacing .Hˆ0 with .Aˆ and .Pˆ with .Bˆ in all the 
formulas that follow. 
The idea behind the perturbation method is as follows. Consider the Hamiltonian: 
.Hˆλ = Hˆ0 + λPˆ, (6.2)

with. λ a dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1. For.λ = 0, the above Hamiltonian 
reduces to .Hˆ0, while for .λ = 1, the above Hamiltonian reduces to the one we are 
interested in, i.e., that of Eq. (6.1). As. λ increases from.λ = 0, the eigenvalues. En(λ)
and eigenkets.|En(λ)⟩ of.Hˆλ start from those of the unperturbed.Hˆ0 and then deviate 
from them until becoming those of.Hˆ when.λ = 1. The perturbation method consists 
of expanding both the eigenvalues and eigenkets in power series of. λ. By truncating 
these expansions at a certain power of . λ and evaluating them at .λ = 1, we obtain 
approximate results for eigenvalues and eigenkets. 
6.1.1 Correction to Nondegenerate Levels 
We here develop the theory for a non-degenerate eigenvalue of .Hˆ0. Let us say that 
the relevant eigenvalue is that of the. nth level

where we have taken into account that .En(λ = 0) = E(0) n and therefore the power

the explicit form of.Hˆλ and Eq. (6.5)

.(E(0)

expand the ket.|En(λ)⟩ in this basis

We take care of normalizing it later. Substituting the expansion of Eq. (6.8) into the

Then Eq. (6.12) becomes

If now, in place of the ket .|En(λ)⟩ appearing on the right, we substitute the entire 
right-hand side (which is also equal to.|En(λ)⟩), we find 
.|En(λ)⟩=|E(0) n ⟩ + Iˆ n(λPˆ − ∆n)|E(0) n ⟩ + Iˆ n(λPˆ − ∆n)Iˆ n(λPˆ − ∆n)|En(λ)⟩ (6.15) 
We can now continue iteratively and replace each occurrence of the ket.|En(λ)⟩ on

. |En (λ)⟩=|E(0) n ⟩ + Iˆ n (λPˆ − ∆n )|En (λ)⟩

In this way, we obtain an expansion of the ket .|En(λ)⟩ in terms of the unperturbed

We have obtained expressions to correct the eigenket to a certain order in . λ. 
However, these expressions require knowledge of.∆(k)

simpler. Multiplying Eq. (6.7) by the bra.⟨E(0) n | we find 
. ⟨E(0) n |(E(0) n − Hˆ
0)|En(λ)⟩ = 0 = ⟨E(0) n |(λPˆ − ∆n)|En(λ)⟩ = λ⟨E(0) n |Pˆ|En(λ)⟩ − ∆n,
(6.19) 
where we take into account that, by virtue of Eq. (6.8), .⟨E(0) n |En(λ)⟩ = 1 for every 
. λ. Therefore, 
.∆n = λ⟨E(0)
n |Pˆ|En(λ)⟩. (6.20) 
Using the power series expansion of. λ for both.∆n (see Eq. (6.5)) and.|En(λ)⟩ (see 
Eq. (6.17)), and equating coefficients with the same powers, we find 
.∆(k)

and so on. Note that if the level in question is that of the ground state, then. E(0) n < E(0) m
for every .m /= n, and therefore .∆(2)
n < 0. Thus, the second-order correction to the 
energy of the ground state is always negative.6.1 Perturbation Theory: Correction to Energy Levels 193
6.1.2 Correction to Degenerate Levels 
We now consider the case where the level to be corrected is a degenerate level with 
degeneracy.d > 1. As usual, we denote by. n the level in question, by.E(0) n its energy, 
and by.|E(0) n,g⟩ the degenerate eigenkets. Therefore 
.Hˆ0|E(0)
n,g⟩ = E(0)
n |E(0)
n,g⟩, g = 1,..., d. (6.24) 
Our goal is to find the eigenvalues.En,v(λ) and the eigenkets.|En,v(λ)⟩ that satisfy 
.Hˆλ|En,v(λ)⟩ = En,v(λ)|En,v(λ)⟩, v = 1,..., d, (6.25) 
where the eigenvalues.En,v(λ) calculated at.λ = 0 all coincide with.E(0) n . In general, 
there is no reason to expect that the perturbation.λPˆ preserves the degeneracy of the 
level. n, so we must consider the possibility that the perturbed energies are different 
from each other. This is why we have introduced an index, the index . v specifically, 
to the energies. If the level no longer remains degenerate, and we anticipate that this 
happens in the majority of cases, we say that the level has undergone a splitting due 
to the perturbation. 
Let us expand the perturbed energies.En,v(λ) in a power series of. λ as we did in 
the non-degenerate case 
.En,v(λ) = E(0)
n + ∆n,v(λ) = E(0)

Proceeding as before, it is straightforward to verify that Eq. (6.25) implies 
.(E(0)
n − Hˆ0)|En,v(λ)⟩ = (λPˆ − ∆n,v)|En,v(λ)⟩. (6.27) 
Since the set of unperturbed eigenkets of .Hˆ0 forms an orthonormal basis, we can 
expand the kets.|En,v(λ)⟩ in this basis.

In this equation, the first sum is a linear combination of the degenerate kets, while 
the second sum is a combination of all the remaining kets. Substituting the expansion 
of Eq. (6.28) into the left-hand side of Eq. (6.27), we obtain 
.

(6.31) 
Unlike the non-degenerate case, if we knew.∆n,v, this recursive equation would not 
be sufficient to calculate.|En,v(λ)⟩. The reason is that we do not know the coefficients 
.cv,g. In the non-degenerate case, this problem did not arise because there was only 
one such coefficient, and we could choose its value to be 1 since normalization can 
always be fixed later. In the degenerate case, the condition of the normalization is 
not enough. It allows us to choose the value of one of the coefficients .cv,g, not all 
of them. Determining these coefficients (up to a multiplicative constant that can be 
fixed later with the normalization) is, however, rather simple. Multiplying Eq. (6.27) 
by the bra.⟨E(0)
n,g'|, we find 
.λ⟨E(0)
n,g'|Pˆ|En,v(λ)⟩ = ∆n,vcv,g' . (6.32) 
This equation, together with Eq. (6.31), allows us to determine both the coefficients 
.cv,g and the corrections.∆n,v at all orders in. λ. In the following, we explicitly work 
with the lowest order in. λ. 
The lowest order in. λ of the quantity.λ⟨E(0)
n,g'|Pˆ|En,v(λ)⟩ is the first order, and it 
is obtained by approximating.|En,v(λ)⟩ with its expression at zeroth order in. λ, i.e., 
with the first term on the right side of Eq. (6.31). Also, for the quantity .∆n,vcv,g' , 
the lowest order in. λ is the first order, and it is obtained by approximating.∆n,v with 
.λ∆(1)
n,v, see Eq. (6.26). Equating the first-order terms in. λ of Eq. (6.32), we find

6.2 Perturbation Theory: Time Evolution 
The perturbative method described in the previous section allows for the approximate 
calculation of eigenvalues and eigenkets of operators given by the sum of an operator 
for which everything is known and a small perturbation. In this section, we want to 
develop a perturbative method that allows for the calculation of the time evolution 
of a ket, independent of the ket, when the Hamiltonian has the form 
.Hˆ(t) = Hˆ0 + Pˆ(t), (6.37) 
where the perturbation.Pˆ(t) is an operator that can explicitly depend on time. As in 
the previous case, we assume that all the eigenvalues .E(0) n and eigenkets .|E(0) n ⟩ of 
.Hˆ0 are known. They can be either degenerate or non-degenerate; the derivation that 
follows does not depend on the degeneracy of the unperturbed levels. We introduce 
the operator 
.Hˆλ = Hˆ0 + λPˆ(t) (6.38) 
such that for.λ = 0 it yields the Hamiltonian.Hˆ0, while for.λ = 1 it yields the Hamil￾tonian in Eq. (6.37). We expand all quantities in power series of . λ. Approximate 
results are obtained by truncating these expansions at a certain order in. λ and eval￾uating everything at.λ = 1. 
Given the ket .|ψ0⟩ at time .t = 0, our intention is to approximately (or perturba￾tively in. λ) solve the Schrödinger equation 
.ih d
dt |ψ(t)⟩ = (
Hˆ0 + λPˆ(t)
(
|ψ(t)⟩. (6.39) 
To do this, we expand the ket.|ψ(t)⟩ in the basis of the eigenkets of.Hˆ0 as follows: 
.|ψ(t)⟩ = ∑
n
e− iE(0) n t
h cn(t)|E(0)
n ⟩. (6.40)196 6 Approximation Methods
The initial condition.|ψ(0)⟩=|ψ0⟩ implies that 
.cn(0) = ⟨E(0)
n |ψ0⟩. (6.41) 
The reason why we have written the expansion coefficients as an exponential times 
the coefficients.cn is easily explained. When.λ = 0, the ket.|ψ(t)⟩ with. cn(t) = cn(0)
constant in time solves the Schrödinger equation, see Eq. (1.148). Therefore, the time 
dependence of the .cn is due to the presence of the perturbation and provides infor￾mation about its nature and how relevant it is. Substituting Eq. (6.40) into Eq. (6.39) 
yields

Continuing to iterate, we generate the power series in . λ. It is important to realize 
that up to this point, no approximation has been made. In this book, we only study 
the first-order approximation in . λ. This means that we approximate .cm(t) with the 
first row of Eq. (6.47). 
The first-order formula is further simplified in the case where the ket at time. t = 0
is an eigenket of.Hˆ0, i.e.,.|ψ0⟩=|E(0)
i ⟩ for some. i. In this case, see Eq. (6.41),

The squared modulus .|⟨E(0) m |ψ(t)⟩|2 = |cm(t)|

i ⟩
evolves to the state .|E(0) m ⟩ at time . t. This probability is correctly zero for .t = 0, but 
it can become nonzero as . t increases. In this case, we can say that the perturbation 
.Pˆ(t) is responsible for inducing energy transitions from the initial level to another 
level. Note that for a transition to occur to a specific level . m, the matrix element 
.Pmi(t) must be nonzero. For example, if.Hˆ0 is the Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional 
harmonic oscillator and the initial state is the ground state of the harmonic oscillator, 
i.e., .|E(0)
i ⟩=|0⟩, then a perturbation of the form.Pˆ(t) = f (t)xˆ will never realize a 
transition to the levels .|m⟩ with .m > 1 because .Pmi(t) = f (t)⟨m| ˆx|0⟩ = 0 for all 
.m > 1.

Let us consider the special case of coherent and monochromatic perturbations, 
such as a laser. For these perturbations, the temporal dependence of the (Hermitian) 
operator.Pˆ(t) is of the form 
.Pˆ(t) = Aeˆ iω0t + Aˆ†
e−iω0t
, (6.52) 
where .Aˆ can be any operator, even non-Hermitian, and .ω0 is the frequency of the 
laser used to perturb the system. Without loss of generality, we assume that.ω0 > 0. 
From Eq. (6.45), we then have 
.Pmi(t) = Ami eiω0t + A∗

, (6.53) 
where we have defined the matrix elements of the operator. Aˆ as.Ami = ⟨E(0) m |Aˆ|E(0)

Let us study the coefficient.cm(t) in the limit of long times. At a certain fixed time. t, 
the function.

α is an oscillating function with a frequency of. t that tends to zero 
as.1/α. The absolute maximum occurs at.α = 0, where the function takes the value 
. lim

sin(αt)
α = t. (6.56) 
Therefore, in the limit.t → ∞, the dominating coefficients are those for which. Ωmi +
ω0 = 0 or.Ωmi − ω0 = 0. This implies that in calculating.|cm(t)|
2, we can ignore the 
mixed terms as they are subdominant in the limit .t → ∞. In fact, if .m is such that 
.Ωmi + ω0 = 0, then the dominant contribution comes from the first term in the square 
bracket, while if. m is such that.Ωmi − ω0 = 0, then the dominant contribution comes 
from the second term in the square bracket. We can then write

To proceed, we need to study the function.g(α, t) = sin2(αt)
α2 . In Fig. 6.1, we show 
the behavior of the function for increasing values of . t. It tends to zero as .1/α2 for 
.α → ∞ while it tends to the value .t 2 for .α → 0. Furthermore, as . t increases, it6.2 Perturbation Theory: Time Evolution 199

points .±π/t. Therefore, we have a curve that, as . t increases, is different from zero 
only near.α = 0 and for.α = 0 tends to infinity as. t 2. This is the classic behavior of 
a Dirac delta function. We can then write 
. lim

α2 = f (t)δ(α). (6.58)

Therefore, the probability .|cm(t)|
2 that, starting from the initial state .|E(0)
i ⟩, the 
system evolves to the state .|E(0) m ⟩ is different from zero only if .|Ami|
2 /= 0 and at 
the same time, the energy difference between the initial and final states is .±hω0. If 
the energy of the state .|E(0) m ⟩ is greater than the energy of the initial state .|E(0)
i ⟩ (so 
only the second Dirac delta contributes), the transition process is called absorption 
because the energy increases and the system absorbs energy. Conversely, if the energy 
of the state .|E(0) m ⟩ is less than the energy of the initial state .|E(0)
i ⟩ (so only the first 
Dirac delta contributes), the transition process is called stimulated emission because 
the energy decreases and the system emits energy. 
The Fermi golden rule is of fundamental importance for the manipulation of 
quantum systems. For example, if we wanted to transition the electron initially in the 
ground state.|1, 0, 0⟩ of the hydrogen atom to a generic level.|n,l, m⟩, we would need 
to use an electromagnetic field with frequency.ω0 > 0 such that. hω0 = En − E1 = e2

6.2.2 Radiation-Matter Interaction 
The electromagnetic fields are one of the most direct methods for transforming and 
manipulating quantum matter. They allow transforming an insulator into a metal, 
changing the color of a material, or transforming it from opaque to transparent and 
vice versa. In Sect. 4.4, we have seen that the Hamiltonian of a quantum particle in 
an electromagnetic field is given by Eq. (4.48). For low intensities, we can neglect 
the term proportional to.A2 and therefore rewrite Eq. (4.48) as 
.Hˆ = pˆ2
2m + Qφ(rˆ) − Q
2mc
(
pˆ · A(rˆ, t) + A(rˆ, t) · pˆ
(
. (6.62) 
Comparing this Hamiltonian with Eq. (6.37), we see that 
.Hˆ0 = pˆ2

.Pˆ(t) = Q
2mc
(
pˆ · A(rˆ, t) + A(rˆ, t) · pˆ

This perturbation is known as the radiation-matter interaction. 
If the electromagnetic field is monochromatic, then the vector potential has the 
form 
.A(r, t) = A0e−i(k·r−ω0t) + A∗
0ei(k·r−ω0t) (6.65) 
where.ω0 is the frequency of the monochromatic field, and. k is a vector with the direc￾tion of the field propagation and a magnitude of.|k| = ω0/c. For light with a frequency6.3 Variational Method 201
.ω0 ≤ ωXUV, where.ωXUV ≃ 2π × 3 × 107 GHz is the frequency of extreme ultravio￾let, we have.|k| < 2π × 0.1 nm. 
−1. Therefore, for atoms and molecules, whose dimen￾sions are at most a few nanometers, we can approximate the exponential.eik·r ≃ 1 for 
all frequencies below those of extreme ultraviolet. This approximation is called the 
dipole approximation. Considering that in a hydrogen atom, the ionization energy 
is .13.6 eV, see Eq. (4.189), we can reasonably expect that frequencies below . ωXUV
allow observing electronic transitions in many atomic and molecular systems. 
Comparing Eq. (6.65) with Eq. (6.52), we see that in the case of the radiation￾matter interaction, the matrix element .Ami that appears in the Fermi golden rule 
is

6.3 Variational Method 
Consider a time-independent Hamiltonian . Hˆ . The variational method is a non￾perturbative approach aimed at obtaining an approximation for the ground state 
of . Hˆ , let us call it .|ψ0⟩, and its energy .E0. It is based on the following simple 
consideration. For any normalized ket.|ψ⟩, the variational principle holds: 
.⟨ψ|Hˆ |ψ⟩ ≥ E0. (6.67) 
The proof of the inequality (6.67) is immediate. We denote by .|ψn⟩ and .En the 
eigenkets and eigenvalues of . Hˆ . Among these, there is obviously the ground state 
.|ψ0⟩ with energy.E0, and by definition.En ≥ E0. The kets.|ψn⟩ form an orthonormal 
basis on which we can expand.|ψ⟩: 
.|ψ⟩ = ∑
n
cn|ψn⟩, ∑
n
|cn|
2 = 1, (6.68) 
where the second equation expresses the normalization condition .⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1. It 
follows that 
.⟨ψ|Hˆ |ψ⟩ = ∑
n
|cn|
2En ≥ E0
∑
n
|cn|
2 = E0. (6.69) 
The variational principle expresses the fact that the mean value of the Hamiltonian 
operator on any normalized ket is always greater than (or at most equal to) the energy 
of the ground state. 
Let us now see how to use the variational principle to formulate the variational 
method. Suppose you have a certain physical intuition about the structure of the 
ground state. Consider, for example, a particle in one dimension subjected to the 
potential.V(x) shown in Fig. 6.2. If this potential admits a ground state with negative 
energy, it would be a bound state, and the corresponding wavefunction would be202 6 Approximation Methods
Fig. 6.2 Example of variational functions for the approximate calculation of the ground state of a 
particle subjected to the potential. V(x)
maximum at the minimum of the potential, approaching zero far from the minimum. 
We could then approximate the ground state with a normalized Gaussian function 
.ψα(x) = ⟨x|ψα⟩ = (α
π
(1/4
e−αx2/2
, (6.70) 
and, correspondingly, obtain an approximation to the energy of the ground state by 
calculating the mean value .E(α) = ⟨ψα|Hˆ |ψα⟩. But which value to choose for the 
parameter. α? In Fig. 6.2, we show three different functions.ψα(x) corresponding to 
three different values of . α. The inequality (6.67) implies that .E(α) is greater than 
.E0 for all . α. The best choice of . α, i.e., the one for which .E(α) is closest to .E0, 
corresponds to the value for which.E(α) is minimized. This leads us to compute the 
best value of. α by solving the stationarity equation 
.
d E(α)
dα = 0; (6.71) 
among all possible solutions of this equation, we select the one corresponding to the 
absolute minimum of.E(α). 
More generally, the variational method consists of writing a “variational” ket 
.|ψα,β,γ,...⟩, depending on parameters.α, β, γ,..., which we expect can well approx￾imate the ground state for a certain choice of parameters. Since the mean value 
.E(α, β, γ, . . .) = ⟨ψα,β,γ,...|Hˆ |ψα,β,γ,...⟩ ≥ E0, (6.72)6.4 Exercises 203
the best choice of parameters corresponds to the values at which the function 
.E(α, β, γ, . . .) is minimized.

1. Consider a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator of frequency . ω and 
let .|n⟩, with .n = 0, 1, 2,..., be the eigenstates of energy .En = hω(n + 1/2).

eigenkets of.Hˆ with eigenvalues. εn, equal to those of the normal harmonic oscil￾lator. Instead the kets.|0⟩ and.|1⟩ are no longer autokets as they are mixed by the

excited state. 
Solution The degenerate kets are.|2, 0, 0⟩|s, ms⟩ and.|2, 1, m⟩|s, ms⟩ where. s =
1/2, .ms = ±1/2 is the spin of the electron and .m = −1, 0, 1 is the quantum

perturbation as 
. Pˆ = λ

where.Jˆ = Lˆ + Sˆ is the total angular momentum. So the perturbation is diagonal

Solution The Hamiltonian .Hˆ is separable and therefore its eigenkets can be 
written as.|nx , ny ⟩=|nx ⟩|ny ⟩, where.|nx ⟩ and.|ny ⟩ are the eigenkets of.Hˆx and 
.Hˆ y respectively; the eigenvalues are instead .Enx ny = hω(nx + ny + 1) with. nx

which the system can transit and the corresponding probability per unit time for

Solution We define .|ψm⟩ and .Em eigenkets and eigenvalues of . Hˆ . Since . Hˆ2
involves only states with .n = 1 ed .n = 3, the kets .|φm⟩=|ψm⟩ with . m /= 1, 3

for any function . f . Let us divide the real axis into intervals of length .∆ and define 
the points .xn = n∆. As .∆ decreases, the points .xn become increasingly close to 
each other, and in the limit.∆ → 0, we obtain all points on the real axis. We use the

If we choose .N to be an even number, then all the exponentials multiplying the

and thus.∆ → 0, the sum becomes an integral over the continuous variable. q. Since 
the minimum value of .qk is .−1/2 and the maximum value is .1/2, the integration

Levi-Civita Tensor: Definition and Properties 
The Levi-Civita tensor .εijk is a three-index object where each index can take the 
integer values 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, in total, we have.33 possible combinations such 
as.ε111,.ε112,.ε113,.ε121,.ε122,.ε123, etc. The value of.εijk can be 0, 1, or.−1 according 
to the following rule 
.εijk =
⎧
⎨
⎩
0 if two or more indices are equal 
1 if (i, j, k) is an even permutation of (1, 2, 3) 
−1 if (i, j, k) is an odd permutation of (1, 2, 3) 
(B.1) 
The Levi-Civita tensor is particularly useful for compactly expressing the compo￾nents of the cross product between two vectors. Let us consider the vector.c = a × b. 
The components of. c are then: 
.c1 = a2b3 − a3b2, c2 = −a1b3 + a3b1, c3 = a1b2 − a2b1 . (B.2) 
Let us show that these three components can be expressed in a compact form as 
.ci = ∑
jk 
εijka j bk . (B.3) 
For example, for the first component 
.c1 = ∑
jk 
ε1 jka j bk . (B.4) 
Since .εijk is zero if two or more indices are equal, the only non-zero contributions 
occur when.(j, k) = (2, 3) or.(j, k) = (3, 2). Therefore 
.c1 = ε123a2b3 + ε132a3b2 . (B.5)

Now,.(1, 2, 3)is an even permutation of.(1, 2, 3), while.(1, 3, 2)is an odd permutation 
of.(1, 2, 3). Therefore,.ε123 = 1 and.ε132 = −1. Substituting these values, we obtain 
the first equation in Eq. (B.2). Similarly, for the other components, we have 
.c2 = ∑

calculations involving vector products 
Propriety 1: If.a jk = akj then 
.
∑
jk 
εijka jk = 0. (B.8) 
This property, used to derive Eq. (2.41), can easily be demonstrated. From the 
definition in Eq. (B.1), it follows that exchanging . j with . k results in .εijk = −εik j . 
Therefore 
.
∑
jk 
εijka jk = −∑

εik ja jk . (B.9) 
Since . j and . k are dummy indices, we can rename . j with . k and . k with . j on the

.

εijka jk = −∑

εijkakj = −∑

εijka jk . (B.10) 
In the last step, we used the fact that .a jk = akj . Therefore, the sum in question is 
equal to minus itself. Since zero is the only number equal to minus itself, the sum is 
zero.

εijkεpqk = δi pδ jq − δiq δ j p. (B.11) 
This property has been used to derive Eq. (4.60). The proof is quite simple. Fixing 
the pair.(i, j ), if.i = j, then.εijk = 0, and we obtain.0 = 0 since the right-hand side 
is also zero. If .i /= j, then there exists only one . k for which .εijk /= 0. For that . k to 
make.εpqk different from zero, the pair.(p, q) must be equal to either the pair. (i, j )
or the pair.(j,i ). In the first case, i.e.,.p = i and.q = j, the only term in the sum is 
.(εijk )2 = 1, while in the second case, i.e.,.p = j and.q = i, the only term in the sum Appendix B: Levi-Civita Tensor: Definition and Properties 233 
is.εijkεjik = −1. In both cases, the right-hand side coincides with the left-hand side, 
and therefore, the property is demonstrated.

We have used this property to derive Eq. (4.59). The proof follows directly from 
Eq. (B.11) by setting.q = j and then summing over. j:

Euler’s Gamma: Definition and Properties 
The Euler Gamma function is defined by the formula: 
.┌(z) =
ʃ∞
0 
dt tz−1 e−t 
. (C.1) 
For small. t, the value of.e−t ≈ 1, and therefore, the primitive of the integrand behaves 
like.tz
/z. It follows that if. [z] < 0, the integral diverges. Hence, Eq. (C.1) provides 
a representation of the analytic function.┌(z) only for. [z] > 0. This function is of 
particular interest because 
.┌(z + 1) =

It follows that for. z = n 
.┌(n + 1) = n┌(n) = n(n − 1)┌(n − 2) = ... = n! ┌(1). (C.3) 
Now 
.┌(1) =

dte−t = 1, (C.4) 
and hence 
.┌(n + 1) = n!. (C.5)
