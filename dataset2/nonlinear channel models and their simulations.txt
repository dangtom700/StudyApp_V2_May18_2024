Preface
With the growth of information globalization, the development of
Internet, data multimedia communication, and video and audio ser￾vices, and the growing need for communication individualization,
mobility, and full coverage, satellite communication is taking advan￾tage of the advantages of long communication distance, which has
nothing to do with the distance communication cost, large coverage
area without being limited by the geographical conditions, and wide
communication frequency band, as well as large transmission capac￾ity that is suitable for the transmission of a variety of services to
develop in the direction of its unique advantages. However, the fea￾sibility and quality of services provided by satellite communication
system are largely affected by the channel characteristics between
mobile terminals and communication satellites. In order to study
these effects, it is an effective and feasible solution to adopt a channel
model that can reflect the real characteristics of a satellite channel.
It is no exaggeration to say that only a channel model close to the
actual characteristics of a satellite channel is not established until the
mechanism of fading, distortion of satellite signal in channel trans￾mission is revealed and the scheme to eliminate fading, distortion of
satellite signal is further studied. It is difficult to design a scheme
that can effectively eliminate the fading, distortion of the satellite
signals, or ill-considering the satellite communication environment.
This book is a collection of the achievements of the author and
his team in the research of nonlinear channel model establishment
and equalization technology based on the nonlinearity of satellite
communication channel for many years. It mainly deals with the

research contents of the satellite channel modeling and equalization
theory, technology, and application based on the established satel￾lite channel model. It has formed the theoretical and technologi￾cal achievements system from satellite channel modeling to satellite
channel equalization, which embodies the advanced, practical, and
systematic content and is clear and readable. It helps readers under￾stand and master this topic. The book consists of seven chapters. In
Chapter 1, based on the analysis of the influencing factors of satel￾lite communication quality, the research status of satellite channel
modeling and equalization technology at home and abroad is sum￾marized, and the research content from the perspective of system
theory is put forward. Chapter 2 briefly analyzes the basic composi￾tion, basic parameters, layered propagation characteristics of satellite
channel, classical satellite channel model and second-order statisti￾cal characteristic parameters, and satellite channel model simulation
method, and so on. In Chapter 3, the satellite channel states in atmo￾spheric environments and ground environments are analyzed, and the
multi-state Markov chain model of satellite channel is established and
simulated. In Chapter 4, aiming at the nonlinearity caused by trav￾eling ware tube (TWT) amplifier and group delay in satellite, the
nonlinear channel model both under the background of the Gaussian
noise and alpha stable distributed noise and based on the combined
effect of TWT amplifier and group delay is created and simulated. In
Chapters 5 and 6, using the established nonlinear channel model and
integrating various novel technologies into the equalization technol￾ogy, the nonlinear channel equalization algorithms are proposed, and
the performance of the proposed algorithms is verified. In Chapter 7,
taking satellite MIMO channel and molecular MIMO channel as the
research object, the multi-state Markov chain model, machine learn￾ing model, and simulation method of MIMO channel are analyzed.

Introduction
Summary
Based on the analysis of the factors affecting the quality of satellite
communication, the main achievements in the establishment of satellite
channel models (single-state model, multi-state model, Ka-band model,
and model simulation method) and the equalization methods (adaptive
equalization and blind adaptive equalization) are summarized in this
chapter. In view of the shortcomings of the existing research models and
methods, from the perspective of system theory, a systematic theoreti￾cal framework and technical system were formed by a main line from
the establishment of the satellite channel model to the research of the
satellite channel equalization method.
Satellite communication can simply be viewed as the communica￾tion between radio communication stations on the earth (including
the ground and the lower atmosphere) using satellite as relay. The
satellite communication system consists of two parts: satellite and
earth station. The wide range of satellite communication makes it
easy to realize trans-oceanic and intercontinental communication. It
is possible to communicate between any two points, so long as they
are within the range of satellite radio waves. At the same time, it
can be received in many places and can realize broadcast economi￾cally and multiple access communication (multiple access character￾istics). The circuit setting is very flexible, which can disperse too
concentrated telephone traffic at any time. The same channel can be
used in different directions or in different intervals (multiple access
connection). In satellite communication, the satellite acts as a relay

station in the air, which can amplify the electromagnetic waves emit￾ted by the earth station and then transmit them back to another
earth station. The satellite data transmission capacity and quality
are not only affected of the satellite equipment itself (such as travel￾ing wave tube amplifier [TWT amplifier or TWTA]) but also affected
by the satellite–ground link environment and the ground environ￾ment (called as the physical channel), such as atmospheric gases, the
ionosphere and troposphere, cloud, rain, euphorbia crystals, eclipses
and storms, and objects on the surface of the earth and electromag￾netic environment interference, clutter interference of earth station
equipment, intermodulation interference, adjacent channel interfer￾ence, cross-polarization interference, artificial malicious interference
and the universe noise, atmospheric noise, solar noise, electric noise,
ground noise, and so on. These factors make the satellite channel
produce many kinds of effects: the fading effect (mainly by atmo￾spheric gases, rain, fog, clouds, euphorbia crystals, objects on the
surface of the earth, and other factors), the multipath effect (mainly
by atmospheric gases, the surface of the earth and the objects on it,
and other factors), the shadow effect (mainly caused by many fac￾tors such as trees and buildings) and channel noises (various inter￾ference factors and all kinds of noise), the Doppler effect (caused by
the relation between the satellite and the ground receiving station),
and the time-varying effect (caused by the rapid fluctuation of the
amplitude and phase of the receiving signals, it is difficult to accu￾rately and promptly change the prediction mode when forecasting).
The channel also presents time-varying characteristics [1], nonlinear
effect (caused by the nonlinear TWTA, nonlinear physical channel,
and nonlinear receiver in the satellite [2]), non-stationarity (caused
by the fluctuation of the physical environment and meteorological
factors [3]), and propagation delay effect (caused by factors such as
troposphere and ionosphere).
These characteristics of the satellite channel are also affected
by the satellite communication frequency band. The most suitable
frequency band for satellite communication is 1–10 GHz, which is
called as the microwave band. In order to improve the data capacity
and quality of satellite transmission, the satellite communication fre￾quency bands are extended to above 10 GHz (such as 12 GHz, 14 GHz,
20 GHz, and 30 GHz). The signal modulation mode is developing
from constant modulus envelope modulation (such as multi-levelJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch01 page 3
Introduction 3
phase shift keying, M-PSK) to non-constant modulus envelope mod￾ulation (such as quadrature amplitude modulation, QAM). However,
at high frequencies, the effects of attenuation, shadowing, multipath,
time variation, and non-linearity of the satellite channels are more
serious, which makes the nonlinear distortion, inter-symbol interfer￾ence (ISI), and inter-channel interference (ICI) of high-order modu￾lated signals very prominent and further affects the quality of the
satellite transmission data. These have become the key technical
problems to be solved in the field of satellite communication.
In order to solve these problems, a satellite channel model which
approximates the actual physical channel should be established
according to the complexity of the satellite data transmission envi￾ronment, and the correctness of the model is verified by comparing
the actual received data with the simulation experiment. Secondly,
according to the characteristics of the satellite channel, the compen￾sation theory (also known as the equalization theory) and the method
of influence of the satellite channel on data transmission should be
established to improve the channel capacity and quality of the data
received by the ground receiving system of the satellite.
1.1 Satellite Channel Modeling Research
In the study of the transmission characteristics of the satellite chan￾nel, there are mainly three models used to describe the transmission
characteristics of the satellite channel: empirical model, geometric
model, and statistical model. The empirical model is used to process
the measured data and establish the corresponding simple formula
with the mathematical fitting method. According to the spatial dis￾tribution of obstacles, the geometric model describes the propagation
characteristics of the received signals by using scattering theory or
ray tracking method. The statistical model simulates the statisti￾cal characteristics of the received signals in different environments
through the combination of different probability distribution func￾tions [4]. The empirical model can describe the sensitivity of the
important parameters, but it cannot explain the nature of the sig￾nal propagation process. The geometric model can predict the action
of single or multiple scattering sources and explain the fading phe￾nomenon of the signal, but its analysis process is very complicated.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch01 page 4
4 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
Compared with the empirical model and the geometric model, the
statistical model simplifies the actual transmission of the signal, and
the analysis process is simpler and the physical meaning is intuitive.
Therefore, the transmission characteristics of the satellite channels
are usually studied by the statistical model, which can be divided into
single state and multi-state according to their description of chan￾nel states. The channel single-state model is mainly used to describe
the stable and single channel environment. In the channel multi-state
model, different states correspond to different probability density dis￾tributions, which are often used to describe the non-stationary and
constantly changing dynamic environment.
1.1.1 Channel single-state model
In 1968, Clarke proposed a statistical model to describe flat small￾scale fading, which is based on the scattering principle and assumes
that the signal received by the receiving terminal is the superposi￾tion of multiple plane waves and it is called the Clarke model [5]. In
1977, Suzuki combined small-scale Rayleigh fading with large-scale
shadowing fading to form a Suzuki model that obeys Rayleigh log￾normal distribution [6], which assumes that there is no main path
which is obviously different from other paths in the channel envi￾ronment and mainly used for the typical urban environment where
there is no direct viewing component. In 1985, C. Loo proposed to
use the two-path model, which is called as the Loo model, to model
the L-band transmission channel [7]. He believed that the received
signal consisted of the main path and the slave path, in which the
main path was affected by the shadowing effect, while the slave path
was composed of pure multipath components. The Loo model com￾bines the Rayleigh process with the lognormal process. Since the
slave path is not affected by shadowing fading, it is also called the
partial shadowing model, which is mainly applicable to open areas
such as rural areas and suburbs. In 1994, Corazza proposed the full￾shadowing channel model [8], which considered comprehensively the
Rice process and the lognormal process, and the empirical formula
of Corazza model parameters for L-band satellite channel was given
by testing the actual satellite link to describe a variety of satellite
mobile channel environments.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch01 page 5
Introduction 5
The Suzuki model, the Loo model, and the Corazza model are
three classical satellite mobile channel models. Later, many chan￾nel models that were proposed are derivatives of these three mod￾els. In 1998, on the basis of the Suzuki model, Patzold proposed an
extended Suzuki model [9]. In this proposed model, Patzold intro￾duced the direct view component and adopted the correlated color
Gaussian noise modeling. In the Loo model, the lognormal distri￾bution describing the shadowing effect of the main path was mod￾ified into Nakagami distribution to establish the Abdi model [10].
Based on the Corazza model, the independent shadowing model was
established based on the assumption that the direct view compo￾nent and the multipath component were independently influenced
by shadowing fading [11]. On the basis of the Corazza model, in
2002, a statistical model was proposed to describe channel transmis￾sion characteristics in non-urban areas [12]. In this statistical model,
K-distribution was used to replace lognormal distribution to describe
channel fading characteristics caused by the shadowing effect. In
2003, the Lognormal–Rician–Rayleigh model (LR2 model) was pro￾posed [13], which can be expressed as other classical satellite mobile
channel statistical models by setting parameters of the model. The
interrelationships among several satellite channel models are shown
in Figure 1.1.

1.1.2 Channel multi-state model
When the mobile terminals are moving in a wide range of environ￾ments, the channel single-state model cannot accurately describe the
actual changing characteristics of the satellite channel. At this time,
the channel characteristics can be described by the channel multi￾state model.
Lutz proposed a channel two-state model [14] in 1991, which
divides the channel environment into “good” and “bad” states
according to whether there is a direct view component in the received
signal. In 2001, Fonton proposed the channel model of the land mobile
satellite (LMS) in a wide area environment [15], which divides the
channel into three states according to the degree of signal shadowing
and describes the different states of the channel via setting differ￾ent parameters of the Loo model. In 2004, Lin proposed a two-level
and multi-state Markov model, which is divided into different levels
according to transmission loss, and each level is divided into several
states [16]. On this basis, a six-state Markov chain model for LMS
channel, published in [17] in 2005, divided the received signal into
two states according to the shadowing fading degree of the received
signal, and each state contained three different substates. In 2006,
the extended Lutz model proposed the three-state Markov chain RM
model [18].
Before the establishment of the channel multi-state Markov chain
model, it is necessary to make artificial assumptions about the num￾ber of channel states and the influencing factors of each state, which
are usually based on experience and lack of theoretical support. Prin￾cipal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy clustering method were
combined for the first time to model mobile satellite channels in
[19–22], which does not make any assumptions about the number
of channel states and the main influencing factors of the signals.
The specific method is given as follows: firstly, the factors affecting
the transmission characteristics of the channel are quantified, and
the PCA method is used to process the quantified data to extract
the main factors affecting the quality of satellite communication and
select the corresponding probability distribution for description; sec￾ondly, the number of the channel states and state transition matrix
are initialized, and the fuzzy clustering method is used to perform
data iteration on the initial data to get the updated state number andJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch01 page 7

state transition probability matrix; thirdly, state transition is real￾ized according to Markov chain. The number of channel states and
the fading distribution of each state are determined scientifically and
accurately, and the error caused by artificial hypothesis is avoided.
Simultaneous interpretation of the same part of the multi-state model
is mostly based on the results of many experiments, so it has high
credibility, while different parts of the channel show the channel char￾acteristics under different transmission environments. The more the
number of states, the more detailed and accurate the description of
the channel characteristics is. However, as the number of channel
states increases, the channel modeling parameters will increase, and
the simulation will become more complex.
1.1.3 Ka-band satellite channel statistical
characteristics
The congestion of the satellite channels has forced system design￾ers to consider Ka-band applications [23–25]. In the high-frequency
band, the influence of different meteorological conditions and trans￾mission media on satellite data transmission is more obvious. In 1998,
Loo analyzed and expanded the measurement data of the mobile
satellite channel in the L band, and both the envelope and phase of
the received signals of the Ka-band satellite affected by the weather
were subject to Gaussian distribution [26]. In 2001, considering the
influence of different weather conditions on the transmission charac￾teristics of the satellite channel, W. Li established the model of the
Ka-band LMS channel on the basis of the Loo model [27]. Then, the
influence of rain attenuation, atmospheric absorption, cloud attenu￾ation, scattering, and atmospheric scintillation on the channel fading
in Ka-band satellite communication was studied [28–32], and a statis￾tical model was established to describe the Ka-band satellite channel.
In 2014, Kourogiorgas proposed a statistical dynamic model of the
rain attenuation [33] to describe the signal attenuation in low earth
orbit (LEO) satellite links caused by rainfall.
With the continuous development of satellite communication tech￾nology, the working frequency of satellite communication is getting
higher and higher, and the influence of various fading factors in atmo￾spheric environments on the signals in the link will be more and more
obvious.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch01 page 8
8 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
1.1.4 Research on satellite channel simulation
research
In the research of the satellite communication system, it is impossible
to test the satellite channel in real time due to the limitation of the
conditions, so the channel emulator is usually used to describe the
fading characteristics of the channel under different environments.
The characteristic simulation of the satellite channel can be realized
by means of software and hardware, both of which can be used to sim￾ulate the actual transmission characteristics of the satellite channel
well. The flexibility of software simulation is high, and it is conve￾nient to simulate and compare the performance of various statistical
models. However, in the actual hardware debugging, the real-time
performance of software simulation is poor due to the large amount
of computation. The channel simulator implemented by hardware
can enable researchers to test the performance of the communication
prototype in real time, which can greatly improve the efficiency of
research and development. However, due to its complex design and
high cost, it also makes the hardware implementation more difficult.
At present, the software simulation of the satellite channel can
be realized based on the MATLAB platform [34,35], and the realiza￾tion methods of the channel model mainly include sum of sinusoid
(SOS) and shaping filter method [36,37]. The sine wave superposition
method is relatively small in computation and convenient in practice,
but its simulation performance has some limitations. The shaping
filter algorithm requires a bandwidth much lower than its sampling
rate, so it is more complicated to be implemented. In terms of hard￾ware implementation, an LMS channel simulator designed by Japan
Communications Research Laboratory can simulate multipath and
shadowing fading effects in channel transmission characteristics [38].
In the same year, Loo realized the simulation of Landsat mobile fad￾ing channel simulator by using the white Gaussian random process
[39]. In 2000, the University of Electronic Science and Technology
of China also completed the design of the principle prototype of the
satellite mobile channel simulator [40].
At present, only a few foreign companies have the physical prod￾ucts of the satellite channel simulator. The SLE900 satellite chan￾nel link simulator, developed by DBM, USA, can simulate the
channel characteristics of the satellite channels, such as time delay,June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch01 page 9
Introduction 9
frequency offset, Rayleigh fading, Rice fading, and Gaussian white
noise. The SCATT8906 device of the GLOCOM in the United States
divides the communication environment into ocean and land and
uses the Rayleigh and Rice fading model to simulate the influenc￾ing factors such as multipath fading and Doppler shift. The MSCS-1
channel simulator, developed by the Australian Telecommunications
Research Institute, adopts the Markov chain process to adjust the
time-varying parameters of the channel model, so as to realize the
simulation of time-varying channels. Most of these channel simulators
are used to simulate several important factors in the ground mobile
channel while ignoring the influence of other factors on the channel.
Therefore, it is necessary to further study the satellite channels, so
as to realize the channel characteristic description of the influence of
various environmental factors.
1.2 Research on Satellite Channel Equalization
At present, the LMSs are taken as the research object, and there
are two main methods to reduce or eliminate the impact of the
satellite channel on the transmission data capacity and quality: the
transmitter-based method [41–45] and the receiver-based method
[46–60]. Among them, the transmitter-based method is very com￾plicated and not suitable for the high-speed data communication
system. The receiver-based method is realized by equalization tech￾nology, which refers to the design of an inverse filter (also known as
equalizer) in the receiver, and is opposite to the characteristics of
multipath, time-varying, fading, nonlinear, and non-stationary chan￾nel, so as to eliminate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by
the satellite channel and improve the channel capacity and trans￾mission data quality. In the equalization technology, the traditional
adaptive equalizer (non-blind), which needs the transmitter to send
the known, periodic, and fixed-length training sequence, needs to
occupy the bandwidth resources with limited rich means, which lead
to reducing the channel capacity and increasing the complexity of
the receiver design. However, the blind adaptive equalizer, which does
not need the transmitter to send the training sequence, can overcome
the shortcomings of the traditional adaptive equalizer. Therefore, it
is necessary to design a blind equalizer in the receiver, which is oppo￾site to the channel characteristics.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch01 page 10
10 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
The main performance indicators of the equalizer are convergence
speed, mean square error (MSE) or inter-symbol interference (ISI) or
bit error rate (BER), computational complexity, and so on.
The main research achievements of satellite channel equalization
technology can be summarized as follows:
(1) ISI canceller: It is suitable for equalizing 16QAM signal, but
there is no report about BER performance, and it is only suitable
for linear channels [51, 59, 60].
(2) Volterra series equalizer: It can reduce the nonlinear ISI between
QPSK (quadrature phase shift keying) signal and QAM signal
and is suitable for low-order nonlinear satellite channels [51, 53].
However, high computational complexity is the main reason to
limit its application.
(3) Maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) equalizer: In
the nonlinear satellite channels, for BPSK (Binary Phase Shift
Keying) signals, the maximum likelihood sequence estimation
equalizer is presented in [50], which is extended to the multi￾stage structure, and consists of many filter bands. For a practical
system, the number of filter bands is too many to be real￾ized. However, the equalizer combining MLSE and decoding with
complex structure is difficult to implement in engineering when
using high-order modulation signal, and the likelihood receiver
is highly sensitive to noise [58].
(4) Coded modulation equalizer : There are mainly equalizers based
on grid modulation coding and turbo modulation coding. The
former does not consider the nonlinear ISI, while the latter’s com￾putational complexity increases with the increase of the length
of the channel impulse response and the order of the modulated
signal. In order to reduce the computational complexity, it is nec￾essary to reduce the computational amount of the equalization
algorithm or use the interference canceller [59, 60]. An equalizer
combining interference canceller with turbo coding is presented
in [61, 62], which can reduce the computational complexity of
16QAM signals to a certain extent, but the improvement of the
BER is not obvious.
(5) Neural network equalizer : The feedforward neural network
(FNN) blind equalizer of the satellite general mobile channel is
suitable for equalizing QAM signals, but its convergence speedJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch01 page 11
Introduction 11
is slow. The bilinear cyclic neural network (BLRNN) equalizer
is simpler and more effective than the neural network equalizer
based on the Volterra series [63–65]. However, the constellations
of 16QAM output still have a certain rotation and poor phase
compensation ability to lead to large MSE.
(6) Blind adaptive equalizer: In 2008, Copjan and Krahulec proposed
a constant modulus blind equalization algorithm based on the
linear constraint, which can effectively recover the multi-carrier
code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) signal using the LMS
channel and is based on the assumption that the channel noise
is Gaussian white noise [66]. In 2009, Copjan and Krahulec pro￾posed to use high-order amplitude phase keying (PSK) signal to
improve the channel capacity of the satellite broadcasting sys￾tem, but it is very sensitive to the nonlinear distortion of the
channel.
To sum up, the existing problems of satellite channel modeling
and equalization technology are summarized as follows:
(1) Major problems existing in satellite channel modeling: In the
aspect of physical environment, the impact of the terrain and fea￾ture environments such as the urban, suburban, rural, and open
land on the channel statistical characteristics is mainly based on
the mobile terminal, but the spatial environments of the satellite–
ground link are not considered. In the aspect of meteorological
factors, the influence of rain attenuation and cloud attenuation
is mainly considered, but other meteorological factors are rarely
considered. In the aspect of channel state classification, the chan￾nel environments are mainly divided into two states, which are
based on the measured data and experience and lack of clear
physical meaning and theoretical support. When considering the
channel stationarity, most satellite channels are assumed to be
stationary, but in fact they are non-stationary.
(2) Major problems in satellite channel equalization: From the
perspective of transformation domain, channel equalization
techniques are mainly time-domain equalization, which has a
large amount of computation, whereas the frequency domain
equalization technology with lower computation loads is rarelyJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch01 page 12
12 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
considered, but there is no report on frequency-domain equaliza￾tion of the satellite channel. From the perspective of equaliza￾tion methods, the traditional adaptive equalization techniques
are mainly used, which waste the limited bandwidth resources
and reduce the channel capacity. However, there are few studies
on blind equalization of the satellite channels. From the perspec￾tive of mathematical tools, Volterra series, maximum likelihood
sequence estimation and neural network, and so on are adopted,
and the equalizers based on these mathematical tools have a
complicated structure, a large amount of computation, and thus
difficult to be implemented in engineering. In terms of consider￾ing channel noise, the channel noise is assumed to be Gaussian
noise, the atmospheric noise is not Gaussian noise but the alpha
distribution noise with a long tail.
1.3 Main Contents of the Book
According to the above analyses, in order to meet the needs of the
development of the new generation satellite communication in the
direction of high-frequency band, high speed and the use of high￾order modulation signals and in view of the fact that the satellite
data transmission environment is extremely complex and the satel￾lite channel bandwidth resources are very limited, the main research
contents of this book are as follows.

methods
A practical satellite channel model is established by considering the
effects of the atmospheric space physical environments, meteorologi￾cal factors, the statistical characteristics of various interferences and
noises, and so on, on the capacity and quality of satellite data trans￾mission.

The Theoretical Basis for the
Establishment of the Satellite
Channel Model
Summary
This chapter first describes the basic components of satellite communi￾cation systems (space satellites, intermediate links, ground control, and
reception) and the basic parameters (elevation angle, azimuth, channel
distance, communication frequency band, satellite–ground link distance,
etc.). The characteristics of satellite channel layering (outer space, ther￾mal layer and middle layer, as well as stratosphere and troposphere)
are analyzed. Typical channel transmission models and classical satel￾lite channel models (C Loo model, Suzuki model, Corazza model, and
Lutz model) are analyzed and the statistical characteristics of the model
performance as well as the simulation method of the classical satellite
channel model are given.
The satellite communication system is a very complicated system,
which includes on-board systems, ground transmitting and receiving
systems, and intermediate link components, and so on. In order to
model the channel of the intermediate link, which does not involve the
structure and principle of the satellite communication system and on￾board devices, it is necessary to understand the basic composition of
the satellite communication system for subsequent channel analysis.

2.1 Basic Components of a Satellite Communication
System
Figure 2.1 shows the schematic diagram of a typical satellite com￾munication system. The entire satellite communication system con￾sists of three major parts: satellite, intermediate link (channel), and
ground control terminals and receiving terminals [1].
Space satellites are the main part of satellite communications
and mainly responsible for detection and forwarding, and it can
be divided into earth exploration satellites, meteorological satellites,
mobile satellites, radio navigation satellites, and maritime satellites
according to their uses. According to the satellite orbit, satellite com￾munication systems are also classified into LEO (low earth orbit),
MEO (middle earth orbit), and GEO (geostationary earth orbit),
which are distributed in different orbits and have different detection
ranges and working frequencies. For example, the orbit of the Iridium
satellite in the LEO system is 500–2000 km away from the ground, so
the transmission delay and power consumption are relatively small,
but the coverage of each satellite is also relatively small. It takes
about 66 satellites to cover the whole surface of the earth.
The orbit height of the GEO satellite communication system is
35800 km away from the ground, covering a large area. Only three
satellites are needed to cover the whole earth (except the two poles).
However, the transmission path is long, the transmission delay is
large, and there is a considerable technical risk.

The intermediate link part (channel), called as the physical chan￾nel, mainly realizes the wireless transmission from the satellite to
the ground receiver. and the channel environment directly affects
the communication quality. A variety of substances in the interme￾diate link, such as air, rain, and clouds, will cause all kinds of losses
including free space loss, ionospheric scintillation loss, rain attenua￾tion loss, gas absorption, and tropospheric loss and further lead to
short-term satellite communication interruption and seriously affect
the stability of the communication system. The link length of the
satellite channel is directly related to the orbit height of the satellite.
The link length of the GEO satellite communication system is the
longest, whereas that of the LEO is the shortest. The main attenu￾ation factors of different satellite channels are very different. In the
GEO channel, because the free space accounts for more than 95% of
the link, the cumulative attenuation is the main attenuation source
of the link. However, the link of the LEO is relatively short, and
the attenuation mainly comes from the absorption of atmospheric
materials and the attenuation of multipath and shadowing.
The ground control and receiving part, including the control ter￾minal and the receiving terminal, are mainly responsible for the
ground part of the satellite communication, whose control terminal
performs the necessary satellite management and control by track￾ing and telemetry and ensures the satellite safety in orbit, whereas
the ground receiving part is composed of the earth surface terminals,
mainly including fixed terminals, motor-driven terminals, and mobile
terminals. Fixed terminals access satellites at fixed locations to pro￾vide different types of services and remain relatively inactive when
communicating with the satellites. The motor-driven terminals are
mobile and fixed at a certain location when it communicates with
the satellite, and the communication connection can be established
after the antennas are deployed. The mobile terminals communicate
with the satellite in motion and can be further classified into land
mobile terminals, aeronautical mobile terminals, and marine mobile
terminals according to the position of the terminals on the surface of
the earth or the adjacent surface. The mobile terminals can generate
a Doppler effect and inter-symbol interference (ISI) when communi￾cating with the satellite.
In the above three parts, the space satellite part, the ground con￾trol, and receiving part mainly study the electrical and mechanicalJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 22

characteristics of the equipment to provide feasible and robust
hardware and software support system for satellite communication.
The main research contents of the intermediate link are in the channel
propagation characteristics to provide the best solution for satellite
communication technology, which has become one of the researching
hotspots of satellite communication technology. It is also the research
focus of this book.
2.2 Basic Parameters of the Satellite
Communication Link
The basic parameters of the satellite communication link mainly
include the elevation angle, azimuth angle, channel distance, com￾munication frequency band, and distance between the satellite and
ground links.
Before the specific analysis, the input parameters, required to be
calculated, are introduced including the longitude lE and latitude LE
of the receiving terminal as well as the longitude lS and the latitude
LE of the satellite. The units of these parameters are degree. The
height H of the earth station is relative to the sea level in kilometers.
Equatorial radius is denoted as rE, orbital radius is denoted as rS,
orbital height is denoted as h = rS–rE, the earth’s eccentricity is
eE, and the longitude difference between the earth station and the
satellite is defined as B = lE − lS.
2.2.1 Elevation from earth station to satellite
The elevation angle θ is a very important parameter that deter￾mines the length of the inclined path through the earth’s atmosphere
and plays an important role in calculating parameters such as gas
attenuation, spatial scintillation, atmospheric absorption, and rain￾fall attenuation. In general, the larger the elevation angle is, the
longer the path is, and the more severe the atmospheric attenuation
is. The elevation angle θ is written as shown in (2.2.1) [2, 3].

2.2.2 Azimuth of earth station
Before the azimuth ϕz of the satellite relative to the earth station is
calculated, the angle Ai is first defined as:
Ai = arc sin sin(|B|)
sin β

(2.2.2)
where |B| is the absolute value of the longitude difference, β =
arc cos[cos(B) cos(LE)], and the azimuth ϕz is determined by the
angle Ai. According to the different relative positions of the earth
station and the earth’s surface substellar (SS) point, there are four
situations, as shown in Table 2.1.
Azimuth ϕz can be obtained directly in two special cases:
(1) If the earth station and the sub-satellite point are the same lon￾gitude, then the earth station is in the northern hemisphere and
the azimuth is 180◦. If the earth station is in the southern hemi￾sphere, the azimuth is 0◦.
(2) If the earth station is above the equator, then the earth is at
the west side of the sub-satellite point and the azimuth is 90◦.
If the earth station is at the east side of the sub-satellite point,
the azimuth is 270◦.
2.2.3 Link distance between satellite and ground
It refers to the distance between the earth station and the satellite.
The calculation of this distance requires the radius of the earth at
the latitude and longitude of the earth station, i.e.,
R = l2 + z2 (2.2.3)

Then, the distance can be written as:

The distance d can be used to determine several important param￾eters of the satellite link, including free-space link loss, which is
directly dependent on the path length from the earth station antenna
to the satellite antenna.
2.2.4 Working frequency
Satellite operating frequencies have a significant impact on the design
and performance of satellite communication links. For example, in
calculating free-space loss, wavelength or frequency is the main
parameter affecting the atmosphere loss and link path loss. These
attenuations caused by different influencing factors are related to
the satellite operating frequency. For example, the rain attenuation
effect must be considered in Ka-band communication and should not
be considered in the lower frequency bands. Therefore, the choice of
frequency bands is of great significance for satellite communication
research.
The frequency of the radio waves is usually defined in two different
ways. The first is the alphabetic representation, which divides the
spectrum of 1–300 GHz into eight representative frequency bands, as
shown in Figure 2.2.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 25

The second one is represented by the ten-band ladder method
of the wavelength, which divides the frequency band from 3 Hz to
3000 GHz into 12 segments, as shown in Table 2.2.
2.2.5 Key parameters in the communication link
In the communication system link, there are several key parameters
shown in Figure 2.3 [4]. Pr and Pt are the receiving power and the
transmitter power, and their unit is W · Gr, Gt denote the receiv￾ing antenna gain and the transmitting antenna gain, r denotes the
distance between the transmitter and the receiver, and its unit is m.
Effective omnidirectional radiation power is an important param￾eter for calculating RF power.
EIRP = PtGt (2.2.8)
Its decibel form is written as:
EIRP = 20 log EIRP = 20 log Pt + 20 log Gt (2.2.9)
where EIRP is an unique quality factor index of the transmitter in
wireless communication link.
2.2.6 Power flux density
Power flux density (PFD)r is defined as the power density at the
distance r from the transmitting antenna and its unit is W/m2.
(PFD)r = PtGt
4πr2 (2.2.10)
According to Equations (2.2.8) and (2.2.10) can be expressed as:

2.3 Layered Propagation Characteristics
of the Satellite Channel
The analysis of satellite channel propagation characteristics is the
basis of channel modeling. The channel propagation characteristics
are related to many factors such as satellite height, carrier frequency,
ground environment, and weather conditions, which are very compli￾cated. The influence degree of various factors on the channel charac￾teristics is very different. Some of them will bring signal amplitude
fading, while others will change the signal phase. These factors can
lead to signal distortion and seriously affect the communication qual￾ity. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the various factors
in the satellite link to the special effects of the propagation charac￾teristics of the satellite channel [5].
The main factors affecting the propagation characteristics of satel￾lite channels include gas absorption, cloud occlusion, polarization
effects, flicker effects, multipath, and shadowing effects, which may
change the propagation direction and amplitude of wireless sig￾nal and result in the decline of communication quality. Only by
fully studying the channel propagation characteristics and adopting
appropriate modulation, coding, multiple access, and power control
technology, the communication quality can be effectively improved
and the “ideal” communication can be completed. A typical satellite
channel downlink [6] is shown in Figure 2.4.
Figure 2.4 shows that the signals from the satellite to the ground
receiving station go through the outer space, the dissipation layer, the
thermal layer, the intermediate layer, the stratosphere, and the tropo￾sphere, which contains different substances and different propagationJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 28

downlink, the main attenuation and interference types of each layer
based on vertical layer are analyzed in turn and the correspond￾ing quantitative calculation methods are given. The attenuation and
interference are spatially distributed, as shown in Figure 2.5.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 29

2.3.1 Outer space
The satellite transmits signals to the ground station at a height of
tens of thousands of kilometers, and the signals first pass through the
outer space, which contain very low outer space density substances in
the form of plasma hydrogen. Although the density of the contained
material in outer space is low, the path of free space is long and
accounts for more than 95% of the total path length, so free space
loss Lf is the most important loss [7]. Its calculation process is as
follows:
Let the receiver antenna gain be Gr, the distance from the trans￾mitter to the receiver is r, the transmitter power is Pt, the transmit￾ting antenna gain is Gt, the receiving antenna power is Pr, and the
free space loss is lf . So Pr can be calculated by:
Pr = (PFD)rAe = PtGt
4πr2 Ae (2.3.1)
where Ae is the effective area of the receiving antenna and
Ae = Grλ2

As can be seen from Table 2.3, the GSO orbital path loss is close
to 200 dB, and the NGSO path loss is also about 150 dB. Therefore,
in the communication link design, the influence of the path loss must
be considered.
2.3.2 Dissipation layer, thermal layer, and intermediate
layer
After the satellite signal propagates through the outer space, it will
reach the dissipation layer, the thermal layer, and the intermedi￾ate layer. The gas in these layers is partially or fully ionized, which
enables the radio wave to change the propagation speed, to cause
refraction, reflection, and scattering, and to produce ionosphere scin￾tillation, which can lead to rapid changes in the amplitude and phase
of radio waves. The main reason is that the irregular distribution of
electron density in the ionosphere leads to wave oscillation and sharp
attenuation. In the satellite–ground link, scintillation effect can be
observed from 30 MHz to 7 GHz. In VHF (very high frequency) band
(30 MHz–300 MHz), the performance of ionospheric scintillation is
particularly obvious. In some weather conditions, the flicker is very
serious and the reliability of communication is seriously reduced.
Ionospheric scintillation is closely related to season, radio frequency,
geometry of observation points, and solar activity, especially in some
special places and seasons. Ionospheric scintillation is mainly forward
scattering and diffraction. The amplitude flicker index S4 is usually
used to quantitatively describe this flicker effect [8, 9], and S4 is the
ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the signal intensityJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 31

where the time average of the signal amplitude is expressed as < · >
and S4 (in dB) is the ionospheric scintillation intensity.
The flicker intensity is related to the peak-to-peak fluctuation of
the signal intensity. Statistics show that the value of S4 obeys the
Nakagami distribution. When the value of S4 is close to 1, it approx￾imates the Rayleigh distribution. Under certain special conditions,
radio wave focusing caused by ionospheric irregularities may result
in the values of S4 to exceed 1.0 and reach 1.5.
When the fluctuation value Pp−p of the observed peak-to-peak
power is known, S4 is given by:
S4 = P0.794
p−p (2.3.8)
In the International Telecommunications Union-Radio Communi￾cations Sector (ITU-R) report, an empirical value based on a range
of flicker coefficients was given, where a Pp−p value of 10 dB corre￾sponded to a scintillation coefficient of 0.5 dB, while the flicker factor
of 1.0 corresponded to a value of above 27 dB. The intensity of the
ionospheric scintillation intensity is the highest in the high latitudes
and near the equatorial region. Figure 2.6 shows the L-band (1 GHz–
2 GHz) scintillation region under the maximum and minimum solarJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 32

activity conditions and gives a change process of day and night flash￾ing. It can be found from Figure 2.6 that the flashing of the ±200
area near the equator at midnight is the most serious.
The ionospheric scintillation changes very quickly with a fre￾quency in [0.1,1] Hz. Common ionospheric scintillation events begin
after sunrise and last from 30 minutes to several hours. However, in
the high years of solar activity near the equator, scintillation events
occur almost every evening and after sunset, and the peak-to-peak
value is above 10 dB. The ionospheric scintillation in high latitudes
is relatively small and rarely exceeds 10 dB even in the high years of
solar activity.
2.3.3 Stratosphere and troposphere
2.3.3.1 Meteorological loss
The earth’s surface is surrounded by the atmosphere, which contains
water vapor, dust, and so on. The temperature will change and the
atmosphere will flow. These phenomena will produce polarization
effects such as rainfall attenuation, atmospheric absorption, scintil￾lation to the flow, rain, and hail.
2.3.3.1.1 Atmospheric absorption loss
The radio signals pass through the stratosphere and troposphere from
top to bottom. These two layers concentrate almost all the atmo￾sphere and water vapor. Among them, ozone in the stratosphere as
well as oxygen and water vapor in the troposphere will cause absorp￾tion and loss of radio wave propagation. At present, there are two
mature and accurate calculation methods [10], that is, the Bailey
method and line-by-line summation method of water vapor and oxy￾gen spectra, and the latter method is used in this book.
The meteorological parameters required by the line-by-line sum￾mation method are as follows: dry air pressure pd(in hPa), where the
unit is shown in the parentheses, similarly written hereinafter, water
vapor partial pressure pw(in hPa) and temperature T(in K), and their
relationship is written as:

Ideally, the above meteorological parameters should be based on
the actual local measurement values. In the absence of local measure￾ments, the standard reference atmospheric pressure is given in ITU’s
supplementary recommendations, which also has good practicability.
Gas decay rate is defined and given by:

where γw and γd denote the value of the attenuation rate caused by
water vapor and dry air, in units of dB/km, f is frequency in units

rate of the entire path can be integrated to obtain the total attenu￾ation along the inclined path. The attenuation of the ground station

where the atmospheric RF refractive index n(H) can be calculated
from the water vapor pressure, along the path pressure, and tem￾perature. When Φ = 0, the Equation (2.3.22) is infinite. In practical
engineering applications, let μ4 = H − h, then such problems can be
solved. If Φ < 0, then there is a minimum height hmin.
In practical applications, numerical calculations are often used

2.3.3.1.2 Rain attenuation
Studies have shown that when the frequency is higher than 10 GHz,
rainfall attenuation has become one of the main attenuations of radio
waves passing through the troposphere. Many scholars have done
a lot of long-term rainfall attenuation experimental measurement
and modeling, but the measurement data will always be limited by
the specific location and link parameters and its practicality is not
strong. To this end, ITU-R presented various predictive models to
predict the expected rainfall attenuation for a given communication
system [11, 12].June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 37
The Theoretical Basis for the Establishment of the Satellite Channel Model 37
In the ITU-R rainfall attenuation model, the relationship between
the attenuation rate γ and the rainfall rate R is given by using the
parameters a and b as γ = aRb, where the unit of γ and R is dB/km
and mm/h, respectively. The organization ITU-R also announced
that the modeling method can estimate annual path attenuation
statistics up to 55 GHz at a given location. In order to calculate
the rainfall attenuation, the input parameters of the model, such
as ground receiving station altitude hs (in km), working frequency
f (in GHz), the elevation angle of the ground θ (in degree), the polar￾ization dip angle τ (in degree) relative to the ground station plane,
and the ground station latitude ϕ (in degree), must be obtained. The
measurement rate is 0.01% of the annual average rainfall rate R0.01.
The specific calculation steps are as follows:
Step 1: Determine the rainfall height hR of the ground
receiving station
The rainfall height (above sea level) of the ground receiving
station is calculated by:
hR = ho + 0.36 (2.3.29)
where the unit of hR is km. ho is the height of the annual
average 0◦ isotherm, that is, the height of the upper atmo￾sphere where the rain is in the transition state between
water and ice.
Step 2: Calculate the length of the inclined path and the
horizontal projection
The slope path length Ls and horizontal projection LG
can be calculated based on the elevation and height of the
ground receiving station and the local rainfall height. The
length Ls of the slope path is defined as the link length
between satellites and ground affected by the rainy clus￾ters, as shown in Figure 2.8.
Ls is calculated by:

where hS is the altitude of the ground receiving station, θ
is the elevation angle, and RE is the equivalent radius of
the earth. Ls < 0, when the rainfall height is less than the
receiving station height.
The horizontal projection is calculated as:
LG = LS cos θ (2.3.31)
Step 3: Determine the average annual rainfall rate of 0.01%
The rainfall R0.01 (1 min cumulative time) is obtained,
where the probability of measuring the ground position
exceeds 0.01% of the annual average. If there is no long￾term statistical data in the local area, the rainfall at the
0.01% interruption rate from the rainfall intensity map,
published by the World Meteorological Organization, can
be used. The rainfall intensity map provides rainfall inten￾sity contours that are exceeded by an average of 0.01% over
the ocean and on land.
Step 4: Calculate the decay rate
The decay rate is calculated by:
γR = kRα
0.01 (2.3.32)
where γR represents the decay rate. k and α denote the
dependent variables and are functions of frequency, ele￾vation, and polarization dip and can be calculated fromJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 39

(2.3.33)
where τ is the polarization angle of linear polarization trans￾mission in the horizontal plane. For circular polarization
transmission, τ = 45◦.

Step 7: Determine the equivalent path length
The equivalent path length LE (in km) is calculated by:
LE = LRv0.01 (2.3.38)
Step 8: Calculate the attenuation over the annual average
of 0.01%
The attenuation prediction exceeding the annual average of
0.01% is calculated by:

2.3.3.1.3 Cloud and fog attenuation
The attenuation of clouds and fog has a great impact on the design
of satellite communication systems operating at frequencies above
20 GHz. Clouds and fog are suspended waters, whose diameters gen￾erally do not exceed 0.01 cm, and are the main factors causing the
depolarization attenuation of signals. The attenuation of the satellite
signals increases with the increase of frequency and the decrease of
elevation.
The communication systems with cloud particle sizes below
100 μm and carrier frequencies below 300 GHz were proposed by ITU￾R and a calculation method of the attenuation of clouds and fog was
introduced [13]. The input parameters in this calculation method are
frequency f (in GHz), elevation angle θ (in degree), ground temper￾ature T, and total liquid water content L(in kg/m2). In addition,
there is the reciprocal of the temperature constant Φ, which belongs
to an intermediate parameter. Its expression is given as:
Φ = 300
T (2.3.40)
The calculation steps of cloud and fog attenuation are as follows:
Step 1: Calculate the relaxation frequency
The second-order and first-order relaxation frequencies of
the double Debye model of the water medium constant are
calculated by:
fs = 590 − 1500(Φ − 1)
fp = 20.09 − 142(Φ − 1) + 294(Φ − 1)2 (2.3.41)June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 41
The Theoretical Basis for the Establishment of the Satellite Channel Model 41
Step 2: Calculate the complex permittivity
Based on the first- and second-order relaxation frequencies,
the real and imaginary parts of the water complex permit￾tivity are given by:

(2.3.42)
where ε0 = 77.6 + 103.3(Φ − 1), ε1 = 5.48, and ε2 = 3.51.
Step 3: Calculate the attenuation rate coefficient
The calculation equation of the attenuation rate coefficient
is given as:
K1 = 0.819f
ε(1 + η2) (2.3.43)
where η = 2+ε
ε . The decay rate coefficient represents the
“dot” attenuation at a particular frequency and water vapor
concentration.
Step 4: Calculate the liquid water column content
The liquid water column content L(in kg/m
2
), when there
is no statistical data on liquid water content in the cloud,
can be calculated by four global maps of liquid water con￾tent contours in clouds provided by ITU-R P.840.5. Con￾tour lines are 20%, 10%, 5%, and 1% over the average
annual time, respectively. These maps are derived from two￾year data with a spatial resolution of 1.5◦ in longitude and
latitude.
The positions of different grid points can be obtained by
a bilinear difference operation on the values of the near￾est four grid points. Figure 2.9 shows the normalized total
content of liquid water in the cloud over 0.01% of the time
of one year, and its horizontal axis represents latitude and
vertical axis represents longitude.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 42

Step 5: Calculate the total attenuation
The total attenuation of the cloud is calculated by:
Ac = LK1
sin θ (2.3.44)
where 10◦ ≤ θ ≤ 90◦. When the elevation angle is less than
10◦, it is not suitable to be calculated by the relational
expression 1/ sin θ, because it assumes that the range of
the cloud is close to infinity. When the elevation angle is
close to 0◦, a physical limit should be imposed on the path
length.
2.3.3.1.4 Tropospheric scintillation
The tropospheric scintillation reflects the rapid fluctuation of the sig￾nal level in the satellite system, which is caused by turbulent fluctua￾tions in the small range of refractive index under certain temperature,
humidity, and pressure conditions. Tropospheric scintillation causes
a change in the phase and amplitude of the electric field. For systems
with low elevation (below 10◦) and low margin (below 3 dB) above
10 GHz, the performance degradation caused by a flicker is greaterJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 43
The Theoretical Basis for the Establishment of the Satellite Channel Model 43
than that of the rainfall attenuation. Therefore, the prediction and
modeling of the tropospheric scintillation is very important.
ITU-R provided a method for quickly calculating tropospheric
scintillation based on local meteorological conditions [9], which may
calculate the standard deviation of the instantaneous signal strength.
The input parameters of the model are as follows: frequency f and
4 GHz ≤ f ≤ 20 GHz, path elevation θ ≥ 4◦, antenna physical
aperture D, average relative temperature T of the ground station
surface over a period of more than one month, humidity H, as well
as antenna efficiency η and in the unknown case η = 0.5.
The calculation steps of the tropospheric scintillation are as
follows:
Step 1: Calculate saturated water vapor pressure
In average relative temperature, the saturated water vapor
pressure pws (kPa) is calculated by:
pws = 6.1121exp  17.502T

The wet-term Nwet of the refractive radio index is given by:
Nwet = 3732esH
(273 + T)2 (2.3.46)
Step 3: Calculate the standard deviation of the signal
amplitude
The standard deviation σref of the signal amplitude is cal￾culated as:
σref = 3.6 × 10−3 + Nwet × 10−4 (2.3.47)
Step 4: Calculate the effective path length
The effective path length is defined as:
L = 
2hL
sin2 θ + 2.35 × 10−4 + sin θ
(2.3.48)
where the height hL of the stratosphere is usually taken as
hL = 1000 m.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 44

Step 5: Calculate the equivalent antenna aperture
The relationship among equivalent antenna aperture Deff
(in m), geometric aperture D, and antenna efficiency η is
written as:
Deff = √ηD (2.3.49)
Step 6: Calculate the antenna averaging factor

2.3.3.1.5 Depolarization effect
In the satellite communication system, linear polarization or circu￾lar polarization is usually used to generate radio waves. These two
polarization states have their own advantages, but both of them use
biorthogonal polarization technology to double the transmission link
capacity on the basis of frequency multiplexing. Depolarization effect
refers to the change of polarization characteristics of radio waves
when they propagate through the atmosphere. The main reasons
for causing this effect are the influence of rainfall, ice particles, and
multipath effect in the transmission path. In the design of satellite–
ground link, cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and isolation
are usually used to measure the polarization effect [14].
The input parameters in the calculation method of rain and
ice depolarization effects in ITU-R include elevation angle θ of the
ground station, polarization dip angle τ relative to horizontal plane,
operating frequency f, and rainfall attenuation Aυ over time ratio in
signal transmission path υ. The calculation procedure is as follows:
Step 1: Calculate the term related to frequency
Cf = 30 lg f (2.3.55)
where GHz 8 ≤ f ≤ 35.
Step 2: Calculate the term related to rainfall attenuation
CA = V (f) log Aυ(dB) (2.3.56)
where
V (f) = 

Step 3: Calculate the polarization improvement factor
Cτ = −10 log[1 − 0.484(1 + cos(4τ ))] (2.3.58)
when τ = 45◦, Cτ = 0. When τ = 0◦ or τ = 90◦, the
maximum value is 15 dB.
Step 4: Calculate the term related to elevation
Cθ = −40log(cos θ), θ ≤ 60◦ (2.3.59)June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 46
46 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
Step 5: Calculate the term related to tilt angle
Cσ = 0.00522σ2 (2.3.60)
where σ refers to the effective standard deviation of the
raindrop tilt angle distribution. When υ = 1%, υ = 0.1%,
υ = 0.01%, and υ = 0.001% of the time percentage factor,
σ is 0◦, 5◦, 10◦ and 15◦, respectively.
Step 6: Calculate the XPD of rain with time percentage less
than p%
XPDrain = Cf − CA + Cτ + Cθ + Cσ (2.3.61)
Step 7: Calculate the item related to the crystal

Step 8: Calculate the effects of rain and ice with less than
the percentage υ of time
XPDp = XPDrain − Cice (2.3.63)
Step 9: Calculate XPD below 8 GHz frequency
For frequencies in the 4 GHz ≤ f < 8 GHz range, the equa￾tion is given by:
XPD2 = XPD1 − 20 lg f2
f1

(2.3.64)
where f1 = 8, XPD1 can be calculated according to Step 8
and f2 is the working frequency in the 4GHz ≤ f < 8GHz
range.

length is different, the arrival time and the phase are also differ￾ent. It can be known from the wave propagation theory that waves
of different phases are superimposed, and the in-phase waves are
strengthened and the anti-phase waves weaken each other, resulting
in multipath attenuation.

terminal is v, and θi is the angle between the direction of the ith
reflected signal from the first scatterer and the mobile receiving end.
When the wireless signal is a narrowband signal, the complex enve￾lope s
(t) of the signals can be expressed as:
s
(t) = Re[s(t)ej2πfct
] (2.3.65)
where Re[·] represents the operation of taking real part, s(t) refers
to the transmitted signal, and fc is the carrier frequency.

2.3.3.2.2 Camouflage shadowing effect
Satellite mobile communications are highly mobile and flexible, and
terrestrial communication locations cannot be pre-selected. There￾fore, when the radio wave propagation path encounters obstacles such
as buildings, trees, and rolling hills, the level of the received signal
will decrease. This phenomenon is called as the shadowing effect, and
the signal fading caused by it is called as shadowing fading [15].
The camouflage attenuation component of the received signal of
the terminal varies with the average power of the region by several
wavelengths, as shown in Figure 2.11.
In Figure 2.11,
P¯r = 10 log(PtGtGrG(r)), (2.3.69)
where G(r) is the path loss factor. Pt,Gt, and Gr are defined as in
Section 2.2.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 49

The shadowing effect is represented by a Gaussian random vari￾able x with a mean of zero and a variance of σ2, i.e.,
f(x) = 1
√
2πσ2

The total received power is defined as:
Pr = PtGtGrG(r) × 10x/10 × α2 = P¯r × 10x/10 × α2 (2.3.71)
where the first and second terms represent the received power
terms in statistical significance due to shadowing attenuation, which
may be defined as the local average power PSF of the shadowing
attenuation, i.e.,
PSF = P¯
r10x/10 (2.3.72)
Its decibel form is written as:
PSF = P¯r + x (2.3.73)
The probability density function of PSF can be expressed as Gaus￾sian distribution with a mean of P¯SF , i.e.,
f(PSF ) = 1
√
2πσ2
e

The long-period camouflage attenuation caused by the topograph￾ical changes in the study area is strongly correlated with the local
environment. Experiments have shown that when the range of motion
of a mobile terminal is several hundred meters, the range of PSF is
40 dB or more, and the value σ varies between 6 dB and 10 dB.
Now consider the statistics of the link shadowing attenuation
of the mobile receiving terminal, the threshold of the power PSF
received by the mobile terminal is set to P0(in dB). Then, the prob￾ability of the signal power, received by the terminal and is greater
than or equal to the threshold, is written as:

2.3.3.2.3 Doppler effect
The relative movement between the receiving terminal and the satel￾lite results in a significant frequency shift among multipath signals,
which is called as Doppler shift and leads to inter-symbol interference
and affects the quality of communication in satellite communications.
The Doppler effect is highly dependent on the relative moving
speed, the direction of motion, and the incidence angle of multipath
signals [16]. Let the mobile receiving terminal move in the schematic
shown in Figure 2.12.
In Figure 2.12, the mobile terminal’s active range (the distance
between X and Y ) is denoted as d, the moving speed is v, the satellite
is at the point S, the angle between the received multipath signals
and the ground is αi and αj , respectively, and the radio wave of
the point S is received by the mobile terminal at the point X and
point Y . The distance difference between them is defined as:
Δl = d cos αi = vΔt cos αi (2.3.76)
where Δt denotes the time difference between the terminal to the
point X and the terminal to the point Y . In actual satellite commu￾nication, the propagation path of the signal is long, and it can be
assumed that the incidence angles of the point X and the point Y
are equal, that is, αi = αi = α, and the phase difference caused by
the different two-path is written as:
Δϕ = 2πΔl
λ = 2πvΔt
λ cos α (2.3.77)
where λ is the wavelength.

According to Equation (2.3.77), the Doppler shift is given by:
fd = 1
2π
Δϕ
Δt = v
λ cos α = fm cos α (2.3.78)
where fm is the maximum Doppler shift.
From Equations (2.3.76)–(2.3.78), if the angle between the receiv￾ing terminal and the incident wave is less than 90◦, the Doppler shift
is positive (the receiving frequency rises), otherwise it is the opposite.
In practical communication technology applications, the received sig￾nals are a sum of multipath components that arrive at the receiver
in different directions, which cause Doppler spread and broaden the
signal bandwidth.
2.4 Classic Satellite Channel Model
According to the subjective experience of researchers, the traditional
channel modeling methods think that there are only one or two fac￾tors that affect the channel propagation characteristics in some cases,
and the factors considered in modeling are relatively single, which
cannot describe all propagation characteristics of a link, but it has
strong pertinence and describes the studied factors clearly.
The classical satellite channel models established by traditional
methods mainly include lognormal model, Rayleigh model, and
Suzuki model. This section first introduces the common probability
distribution function and then introduces the classical satellite chan￾nel model, which lays the necessary foundation for the subsequent
channel modeling research.
2.4.1 Common probability distribution functions
In the study of satellite channel transmission characteristics, four
kinds of probability distribution functions are used, which are Gaus￾sian distribution function, Rician distribution function, lognormal
distribution function, and Nakagami distribution function. These can
be described as:
2.4.1.1 Gaussian distribution

factors (rainfall, snowfall, cloud, etc.) on signal transmission can be
described by Gaussian distribution, which can describe the distribu￾tion of signal envelope and phase [17, 18].
The probability density function (PDF) of Gaussian distribution
can be expressed as:
fGus(r) = 1
√
2πσ
exp(−(r − mG)2
2σ2
G
) (2.4.1)
where mG and σ2
G are the mean and variance of Gaussian distribu￾tion, respectively. The mean determines the position of the distri￾bution, the variance determines the magnitude of the distribution,
and the probability density function curve is symmetric. Figure 2.13
shows the curves of the Gaussian probability density function with
the mean mG = 0 and variance σ2
G taking different values.
2.4.1.2 Rice/Rayleigh distribution
In the process of radio wave propagation, it will encounter various
obstacles such as buildings, trees, hills, and so on, which will pro￾duce reflected wave, scattered wave, and diffraction wave, to make
the received signal be the superposition of multipath signals. Due to
the different transmission time in each path, the phase is different
when it reaches the receiver. When the signals of different phasesJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 53
The Theoretical Basis for the Establishment of the Satellite Channel Model 53
are superimposed, they are often enhanced in phase, weakened in
opposition, and sometimes even offset each other. In this way, the
amplitude of the received signal will reduce sharply, which leads to
multipath fading. If there are multipath component and direct com￾ponent in the received signals, the signal envelope obeys Rice distri￾bution [18]. If there is only reflected wave and no direct wave in the
received signals, the envelope of the received signal obeys Rayleigh
distribution [19].
Let the unmodulated carrier signal be given as:
s(t) = cos(ωct + ϕc) (2.4.2)
The Doppler shift of the nth path is denoted as fdn = v cos αn/λ.
If the received signal is a superposition of multipath signals and a
direct view signal, the amplitude r(t) is given by:
r(t) = c0 cos(ωct + ϕc + Δω0t) +
N
n=1
cn cos(ωct + ϕc + φn + Δωnt)
(2.4.3)
where the first term is the line of sight (LOS) component, and the
latter term is the superposition term of the multipath signals. Δωn =
2πfdn, φn is the phase deviation of the nth path. θ1 = ϕc + Δω0t,
θ2 = φc + ϕn + Dωnt, then Equation (2.4.3) can be written as:

The magnitude of the multipath fading can also be expressed
by the Rice factor K, which represents the ratio of the power of
the direct view component to that of the multipath component i.e.,
K = z2/(2σ2). The larger the Rice factor is, the lower the power of
the multipath component in the received signals relative to the direct
view component power. When K = 0, the direct component of the
total received signals is smaller.
When the direct view component z is zero, the Rice distribution
becomes a Rayleigh distribution, which is a type of common proba￾bility distribution to describe the characteristics of flat fading chan￾nels. When there is no direct view component in the received signals,
only the superposition of multipath components, the envelope of the
received signal obeys the Rayleigh distribution.
The PDF of the Rayleigh distribution is written as:
fRay(r) = r
σ2 exp 
− r2
2σ2

(2.4.21)
where σ2 is the variance of the Rayleigh distribution and r ≥ 0.
The n-order origin moment of the multipath signal r is written
as:
E[rn] = nσ2E[rn−2], n ≥ 2 (2.4.22)
Figure 2.14 is a plot of the probability density function for the
variance σ2 = 1, direct component z = 1, and z = 0, respectively.
2.4.1.3 Lognormal distribution
When satellite signals propagate through obstacles such as leaves
and thin clouds, radio waves create shadowing effect duo to absorp￾tion or scattering. The shadowing effect exists in both LOS (Line of
Sight) propagation and multipath transmission. In this section, the
shadowing effects under LOS propagation are discussed [20].
Let the unmodulated carrier signal be written as:
s(t) = A cos(ωct + φc) (2.4.23)
The Doppler shift of the LOS signal is denoted as fd = v cos α/λ,
and the shadow masking factor is denoted as C(t) = *N

The Nakagami distribution is a kind of generalized Rayleigh distribu￾tion. In the actual wireless environment, the Nakagami distribution
can well approximate the actual measured results, and by adjusting
the parameters, channel simulations of different fading degrees can
be realized, so it can be widely applied to the simulation of fading
channels [21].

of the Nakagami distribution, which indicates the fading degree of
the signal caused by channel multipath effects. The smaller the value
of m is, the more serious the channel attenuation is. The PDF of
the Nakagami distribution with different values of m is shown in

2.4.2 Classic satellite channel modeling
The main task of channel modeling and simulation is to reflect the
signal changes in the real transmission environment as much as pos￾sible. In the actual transmission environment, there are many factors
that affect the signal transmission. At this time, the channel model
cannot simulate every factor accurately. However, channel modeling
and simulation can describe the main factors affecting signal trans￾mission relatively accurately. Through the simulation of these main
factors, it provides a theoretical basis and technical support for the
design of a satellite communication system. A typical channel model
is shown in Figure 2.16.
In Figure 2.17, the modulation signal x(t) is written as:
x(t) = Re[x1(t)ej2πfct
] (2.4.35)June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 61

where x1(t) is the equivalent low-pass signal of the transmitted signal
and fc is the carrier frequency.
In the absence of noise, the received signal of the system can be
expressed as:
y(t) =  ∞
−∞
h(f, t)X1(f)ej2πftdf (2.4.36)
where X1(f) is the Fourier transform of the equivalent low-pass signal
and h(f, t) is the transfer function of the communication system.
For a flat fading channel, it can be regarded as a random quantity
independent of frequency, which is equivalent to h(0, t), and at this
time, the received signal can be simplified as:
y(t) = h(0, t)
 ∞

X1(f)ej2πftdf = h(0, t)x1(t) (2.4.37)
Equation (2.4.37) shows that the received signal can be expressed as
the product of the transmitted signal and the random variable h(0, t)
with time-varying characteristics, that is, the effect of the wireless
channel on the transmitted signal is expressed as a product relation￾ship, so it is a kind of multiplicative interference to the transmitted
signal. h(0, t) is a function of time and reflects changes of channel
characteristics with time. As interference will cause random attenu￾ation and distortion with time, it can only be described by random
process. The modeling and simulation of channel is the study and
implementation of h(0, t).
In the satellite communication system, multipath fading and shad￾owing fading of signals are the main factors affecting transmission
characteristics of the channel. These fading effects affect the envelope
and phase of the received signal. However, in the actual research, the
loss caused by the signal phase is smaller than the fading of the signal
envelope. Therefore, in the study of satellite channel model, only the
influence of signal amplitude is usually considered, and the influence
of the signal phase is ignored.
2.4.2.1 C. Loo model
The C. Loo model is a statistical model of the channel established by
a probability density function describing the multipath fading and
shadowing fading [22]. In the C. Loo model, the received signal of theJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 62
62 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
terminal is the combination of the direct view component and the
multipath components, and the direct view component is affected
by the shadowing fading, while the multipath components are not
affected by the shadowing fading. Therefore, the C. Loo model is
also called partial shadowing model and is mainly used to describe
rural or suburban communication environment.
The terminal receiving signal r(t) for the C. Loo model is denoted
as:
r(t) = z(t)s(t) + d(t) (2.4.38)
where z(t) is the direct view component, d(t) is the multipath com￾ponent, and s(t) is the shadowing fading.
When the amplitude of direct view component z(t) remains the
same, the received signal r(t) can be regarded as a combination of
the direct view component and the multipath components. At this
time, the envelope of r(t) is subject to the PDF of the Rice distribu￾tion, i.e.,
f(r|z) = r

I0

(2.4.39)
where σ2 is the average power of the multipath components and I0(x)
is the first type of modified zero-order Bessel function.
Since the direct view component is affected by the shadowing fad￾ing, the PDF of the envelope of z(t) obeys the lognormal distribution
and can be written as:
f(z) = 1
√2πσZz · exp (−(ln z − mZ)2
2σZ
) (2.4.40)
where mZ and σZ are the mean and variance of the direct view
component obeying the lognormal distribution, respectively.
Therefore, from the Equations (2.4.39) to (2.4.40), the PDF of
the received signal envelope for the C. Loo model is expressed as:

The C. Loo model, proposed in the literature [52], describes the
parameters of the Ka-band satellite channel affected by three dif￾ferent degrees of shadowing, as shown in Table 2.4. The statistical
characteristics of the C. Loo model under these three channel envi￾ronments are shown in Figure 2.18.
2.4.2.2 Suzuki model
The Suzuki model is a statistical model established by both multi￾path fading effects and shadowing fading effects [23]. It is assumed
that there is no direct view component between the mobile ter￾minal and the satellite, and the received signal is a superposition
of the reflected signals of the individual independent paths as well
as its envelope obeys the Rayleigh distribution. At the same time,
the power of the Rayleigh process changes significantly due to the
effects of shadowing fading. In this case, the Suzuki model can moreJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 64

accurately describe the transmission characteristics of the channel
under typical urban environments.
The received signal r(t) of the Suzuki model can be represented by
the product of the Rayleigh process d(t) and the lognormal process
s(t), i.e.,
r(t) = d(t)s(t) (2.4.42)
where r(t) is the received signal, d(t) is the multipath components
of the signal, and s(t) is the shadowing fading effect of the signal.
According to the theory of stochastic process, the PDF of the

curves under light and heavy shadowing areas.
2.4.2.3 Corazza model
The Corazza model consists of Rician process and lognormal process.
In the Corazza model, the received signals of the terminal include
direct view component and multipath components and is affected by
shadowing fading during transmission. Therefore, the Corazza model
is also called the total shadowing model, can the simulate satellite
channels in different environments, including rural, suburban, and
urban areas, based on setting parameters reasonably.
The received signal of the terminal for the Corazza model is writ￾ten as:
r(t)=[z(t) + d(t)]s(t) (2.4.46)June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 66
66 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
where r(t) is the terminal receiving signal, d(t) is the multipath
components of the signal, z(t) is the direct view component, and
s(t) denotes the shadowing fading effect of the signal. z(t) and d(t)
reflect the multipath fading effect of the channel, and these two
fading effects of the channel are independent of each other. Accord￾ing to the stochastic process theory, the probability density function
of the terminal receiving signal envelope r in the Corazza model is

where θ is the elevation angle of the satellite and its value ranges
from 20◦ to 80◦. The specific coefficients in the parameter fitting
equation are shown in Table 2.6. For a given satellite elevation angle,
the corresponding parameters of the model can be calculated by the
fitting equation. Figure 2.20 shows the statistical characteristics of
the Corazza model at three different satellite elevation angles when
the shadowing environment in the country is shaded.
2.4.2.4 Lutz model
The Lutz model is a two-state channel model based on a probability
distribution function to describe a wide area environment. In the
Lutz model, the satellite channel is divided into two states of “good”
and “bad” according to the presence or absence of the direct view
component in the actual communication process [26]. The switching
between the two states in the Lutz model is determined by changes
of the actual communication environment.
In the “good state” environment, the quality of the channel trans￾mission signal is good, and the terminal receiving signal is a combi￾nation of the direct view component and the multipath componentsJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 69

In the “bad state”, the channel environment is relatively compli￾cated, the direct view component of the transmitted signals is com￾pletely blocked, and the terminal receiving signals only have multi￾path components, which are also affected by shadowing fading. At
this point, the envelope of the received signal is subject to a Rayleigh–
lognormal distribution.

power PT in Lutz model is as follows:
fLutz(PT) = (1 − A)fg(PT) + Afb(PT) (2.4.68)
The Lutz model describes the two-state channel characteristics
when the geographical environment changes. The typical values of
L-band mobile satellite channel under different satellite elevation
described by Lutz model were given by [26]. Figure 2.21 shows the
statistical characteristics of the Lutz model when the urban and sub￾urban environment changes at two elevations.
2.5 Statistical Characteristics of Satellite Channels
The main first-order parameters to measure channel index are
probability statistic characteristics of envelope and phase, and the
second-order statistical characteristics mainly include fading rate,
level crossing rate (LCR), and average fading duration(AFD), which,
respectively, describe the channel quality from different angles. Tak￾ing Rayleigh and Rice distribution as examples, the first-order
statistical properties and second-order statistical properties are intro￾duced, respectively.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 72

2.5.1 First-order statistical properties

It can be seen that the Rice distribution and the Rayleigh distribu￾tion are mutually convertible. When c0 → 0 in the Rice distribution,
the Rice distribution can be converted into a Rayleigh distribution.
Therefore, the Rayleigh distribution is a special case of the Rice dis￾tribution, and the Rice distribution is an extension of the Rayleigh
distribution [27].

2.5.2 Second-order statistical property
2.5.2.1 Fading rate
The fading rate is a physical quantity that reflects the rate at
which the channel fluctuates with time, space, and frequency. Fig￾ures 2.22(a) and 2.22(b) are the curves of the signal envelope level
obeying the Rayleigh distribution with time. Obviously, these two
curves are very different, and the change of the curves in Fig￾ure 2.22(a) is significantly faster than that in Figure 2.22(b). Their
fading rates [28, 29] are different.
The channel fading rate is based on the time derivative of the
channel. The time-varying channel impulse response is denoted as
h˜(t) and its derivative is dh˜(t)/dt. Because E[dh˜(t)/dt] = 0, it is
impossible to describe the fluctuation of the channel with dh˜(t)/dt.
While E[|dh˜(t)/dt|
2] = 0, the fluctuation degree of the channel can
be described by |dh˜(t)/dt|
2, that is, the fading rate can be described.
For a generalized stationary random (WSS, Wide-Sense Station￾ary) channel with a fixed phase,
Φ(t) = arg[h˜(t)] (2.5.4)
If the center frequency of the Doppler spectrum Sh˜(t)(ω) is not
zero, the random phase is non-stationary and its mathematical expec￾tation is a function of time, i.e.,

2.5.2.2 Level crossing rate
Level crossing rate (LCR) is a statistical process of time. In chan￾nel modeling, it is defined as the average number of times that the
envelope r of the signal is lower than a given level threshold in one
second [30, 31]. The level crossing rate Nt(r) is defined by both the
joint PDF of the envelope r and its time derivative dr/dt as:
Nt(R) =  ∞
0
rf˙ rr˙(R, r˙)dr R ˙ ≥ 0 (2.5.9)
where frr˙(R, r˙) is the joint PDF of both the envelope r and its time
derivative when r = R.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 75

Let’s take the Rice distribution as an example to derive its time
domain level crossover rate. The PDF, of the Rice distribution signal

where c0 and θ0 are the amplitude and phase of the direct view
component, 2σ2 is the signal power, erf(·) is the error function, and
θ is in the range 0 ∼ 2π.
The time domain level crossing rate frr˙(r, r˙) of the Rice process
is written as:

where fm is the maximum of the Doppler shift and f(θ) is the PDF
of the incident angle. From Equation (2.5.11), the level crossing rate
of the Rice distribution is the product of its PDF and the constant
b2/2π, where b2/2π is determined by fm and f(θ) together.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 76

distribution is known as:

0 · I(2c0
k(k + 1)) (2.5.15)
where K is the Rice factor.
2.5.2.3 Average fading duration
The average fading duration (AFD) is defined as the duration of
each signal level below a given threshold, and its calculation method
is similar to that of the level crossing rate. Let the given threshold
be R and the fading signal be r(t), then the average fading duration
[32] is defined as:
t
¯(R) = Fr(R)
Nt(R) (2.5.16)
where Nt(R) is the level crossing ratio of the signal r(t) and Fr(R)
is the cumulative probability distribution function of the signal
r(t), which represents the probability that the signal is below a given
level R.
2.5.3 Doppler power spectrum
If there is relative movement of the receiving terminal or satellite,
a Doppler effect will occur, which causes a Doppler shift. After all
the scattering components are superimposed, a continuous Doppler
spectrum is formed, which is also known as the “Doppler power spec￾trum”. The common power spectrums are the classical power spec￾trum and the Gaussian power spectrum [33, 34].June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 77

2.5.3.1 Classic power spectrum
Assume that there are incident waves in N directions, whose incident
power in the range of 0 ∼ 2π is continuous, p(α)dα is the incident
energy with an incident angle of [α, α+dα], P¯ is the average received
power of the omnidirectional antenna, and G(α) is the antenna gain
in the α direction. If N tends to infinity, then p(α)dα is a contin￾uous distribution. The total incident energy in the range of 0 ∼ 2π
is defined as:
Pr =
 2π
0
AG(α)p(α)dα (2.5.17)
The carrier frequency of the transmitted signal is fc, then the
Doppler frequency is calculated by:
f(α) = v
λ · cos α + fc = fm · cos α + fc (2.5.18)
where v is the relative moving speed, λ is the carrier wavelength, and
fm is the maximum of the Doppler shift. Since the cosine function
is an even function, f(α) is also an even function, that is, there is
f(−α) = f(α).
Let the channel impulse response be written as:
h(t) = h1(t) cos(2πfct) + h2(t) sin(2πfct) (2.5.19)
Let Shh(f) denote the received signal power spectrum, then
Shh(f)|df| = A[p(α)G(α) + p(−α)G(−α)]|dα| (2.5.20)
At the same time, by derivation of Equation (2.5.18) with respect
to frequency f, the following equation can be obtained.
|df| = fm| − sin α||dα| (2.5.21)
where
α = cos−1

depending on the direction of arrival.

gain G(α) is constant 2σ2

2.6 Satellite Channel Model Simulation Method
The research task of the satellite channel implementation method is
to design the probability statistics model into a random process that
can be realized in a computer, DSP, or FPGA by designing relevant
algorithms. The first- and second-order statistical characteristics of
the random process should be the same as the original probabil￾ity statistics model, and other performance indicators should also
meet the design requirements. This section gives the implementa￾tion method of the common single state model and the calculation
method of related parameters.June 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 80

2.6.1 Generation method of colored Gaussian noise
All channel simulations are based on several real colored Gaussian
processes. The difference between different channel models lies in the
number of real Gaussian processes and different processing methods.
For example, Rayleigh and Rice models are simulated by two real
Gaussian processes, while Suzuki model [36] is simulated by three
real Gaussian processes.
The above analyses show that real Gaussian process is the basis
and premise of the channel simulation [37, 38]. The correlation of
real Gaussian process determines the superior performance of the
simulation model. How to generate a real Gaussian process to meet
the requirements becomes the key of research. The generation process
of the colored Gaussian process ˆμi(t) is shown in Figure 2.24.

fi,n = nΔf1 (2.6.3)
where θi,n is a Doppler phase shift and a random variable distributed
within [0, 2π]. When Ni → ∞, Δfi → 0, the frequency tends to be
continuously distributed, then ˆμi(t) → μi(t), Sμiμi (·) is the power
spectral density.

2.6.2 Calculation method of Doppler coefficient
and Doppler frequency
There are many calculation methods for parameters ci,n and fi,n such
as equidistance method, MSE method, equal area method, and Monte
Carlo method, which have their own advantages and disadvantages
[39, 40] and can be selected according to the needs of the system
design. Based on the analyses of above several calculation methods,
an improved Doppler coefficient and frequency calculation method is
proposed in this section.
2.6.2.1 Equidistance method
One of the main features of the equidistance method is that adja￾cent discrete Doppler frequency pairs have equal distances. Discrete
Doppler frequency is defined as:
fi,n = Δfi
2 (2n − 1) (2.6.4)
where n = 1, 2,...,Ni. The distance between the ith adjacent dis￾crete Doppler frequency pairs of the deterministic process ˆμi(t) is
defined as:
Δfi,n = fi,n − fi,n−1 (2.6.5)
where n = 2, 3,...,Ni.
In practical applications, since |f| < fmax, the distance Δfi
between two adjacent discrete Doppler frequency pairs can be taken
as fmax/Ni, so
fi,n = fmax
2Ni
(2n − 1) (2.6.6)
When calculating the Doppler coefficient ci,n, the power spectral
density Sˆμiμi (f) of the deterministic simulation model must be equal
to the power spectral density Sμiμi (f) of the reference model in the
interval Li,n =

2.6.2.2 Equal area method
The equal area method (MAE) means that the area of the Doppler
power spectrum Sμiμi (f) is equal to σ2
μi
/2Ni in any adjacent fre￾quency range fi,n−1 <f<fi,n under the condition that the power
spectral density function is constant, i.e.,

Sμiμi (f)df = σ2

2Ni
, n = 1, 2,...,Ni (2.6.9)
where, when n = 0, fi,0 = 0. In order to calculate the discrete
Doppler frequency fi,n−1, the following function is defined by:
Fμi (fi,n) =  fi,n
−∞
Sμiμi (f)df (2.6.10)
It is known from Equation (2.5.26) that Sμiμi (f) is an even func￾tion, that is, Sμiμi (f) = Sμiμi (−f), so
Fμi (fi,n) =

2.6.2.3 MSE method
The data of the MSE method (MSEM) is obtained when the MSE
value takes the minimum value [41]. Let the MSE of Rμμ(τ ) be
defined as:
ERμμ = 1
τmax  τmax
0
(Rμμ(τ ) − R˜μμ(τ ))2dτ (2.6.14)
where τmax represents the maximum value of this interval τ and is
calculated by τmax = Ti/4=1/2Δfi. Rμμ(τ ) is an arbitrary autocor￾relation function of describing the theoretical reference model process
μ(t) and R˜μμ(τ ) is the autocorrelation function of the deterministic
model.
In practical applications, the solution of discrete Doppler fre￾quency shift fi,n is usually set as a set of relatively simple equidis￾tance values, e.g.,
/
fi,n|fi,n−1 = Δfi
2 (2n − 1), n = 1, 2,...,Ni
0
(2.6.15)
Equation (2.6.14) is used to calculate the partial derivative of
Doppler coefficient cn, and let ∂ERμμ
∂cn = 0, then
ci,n =
 
4
τmax  τmax
0
Rμμ(τ ) cos(2πfi,nτ )dτ, n = 1, 2,...,Ni
(2.6.16)
When τmax = Ti/4=1/2Δfi and Δfi → 0, the parameter ci,n is
obtained by:
ci,n = lim
Δ fi→0
2

ΔfiSμμ(fi,n) (2.6.17)
Numerical analysis shows that when Δfi > 0, the parameter ci,n
is regained by:
ci,n ≈ 2

That is, the design requirement that the MSE is the smallest is
satisfied.
The calculation processes for determining the parameters ci,n,
fi,n, and θi,n, according to the equal area method, the equidistance
method, and the minimum MSE method, are given above, but the
discrete Doppler frequencies obtained by the three methods have
the same distance characteristic between adjacent frequency pairs.
However, they all have one common drawback, that is, the designed
deterministic Gaussian process has a relatively small period, and
the calculation process associated with Gaussian power spectrum is
highly complicated [42, 43].
2.6.2.4 Improved Doppler coefficient and frequency
calculation method
In view of the shortcomings of the traditional method for calculat￾ing the parameters, an improved method of the Doppler coefficient
and frequency is proposed in this section. The starting point of this
method is as follows:
J0(z) = 2
π

Its limit is expressed as:

The Theoretical Basis for the Establishment of the Satellite Channel Model 85
The autocorrelation function of the classical power spectrum is
gained by:
Rμμ(τ ) = σ2
0J0(2πfmτ ) (2.6.22)
After Equation (2.6.21) is substituted into Equation (2.6.22),
Rμμ(τ ) is rewritten as:

From the above analyses, the improved method of calculating
Doppler coefficient and frequency is relatively simple.
2.6.3 Doppler phase calculation method
In the calculation of the parameters ci,n and fi,n, it is assumed that
the Doppler phase θi,n is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π), but this
may result in a certain correlation among ci,n, fi,n, and Rμμ(τ ) in
the effective range, which cannot satisfy the high-precision design.
The demand for colored Gaussian noise is highly transient [41,44]. To
solve this problem, a standard phase vector Θi with Ni deterministic
elements is now introduced, i.e.,
Θi =

(2.6.27)

(θi,1, θi,2,...,θi,Ni ) be the combination of the standard phase shiftJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 86

vector Θi, and there are Ni! combination modes. After the above
processing, the design requirements for the random value of θi,n in
the [0, 2π) can be truly satisfied.
Figure 2.25 shows the curves of two Doppler phase calculation
methods. It can be seen from Figure 2.25 that the combined phase
shift method can well simulate the channel model.
The above methods for the implementation of colored Gaussian
noise process and the calculation method for Doppler coefficients,
Doppler frequency, and Doppler phase calculation methods are stud￾ied. This will lay the foundation for the simulation implementation
research of the subsequent channel model.
2.6.4 Simulation implementation method
of the classical channel model
In the satellite channel model, common channel models include
Rayleigh, Rice, Suzuki, and lognormal. Other channel models can
be transformed by combining these common models. Therefore, in
the channel model design, it is very necessary to fully study the sim￾ulation implementation method of the classical channel model. In
this section, the simulation implementation method of the classical
channel model is obtained by the combination of colored Gaussian
noise [39, 45].

2.6.4.2 Simulation implementation method of Rice channel
model
Both the Rice channel model and the Rayleigh channel model can
describe multipath channels. The most significant difference between
them is that there is a direct view component in the Rice channel
that reaches the receiving terminal through the direct view path,
while the signals in the Rayleigh channel are all multipath signals,
without direct view path. The Rice channel model is suitable for the
suburban environment, whereas the typical scene of the Rayleigh
channel model is the urban environment. The Rice channel model isJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 88

μ(t) = μ3(t) + jμ4(t) (2.6.33)
m(t) = m3(t) + jm4(t) (2.6.34)
where μ3(t) and μ4(t) are colored Gaussian process and the simula￾tion implementation process is shown in Figure 2.24. Two direct view
signals are m3(t) and m4(t), and mi(t) = cos[2πf + θ + (i + 1)π/2]
is the ith direct view signal and i = 3, 4. f and θ represent the fre￾quency and phase of the direct view signal. The Rice channel model
is obtained by constructing the complex random process and tak￾ing its modulus. The simulation implementation process is shown in
Figure 2.27.
2.6.4.3 Simulation implementation method of lognormal
channel model
In the propagation process of the satellite signals, when satellite sig￾nals pass though urban environments such as clouds and polluted
areas, they will have a shadowing fading effect, which is called as a
large-scale fading, and the entire propagation path of the satellite
signals exists in a non-ideal propagation environment. The envelope
of the satellite signals can be described by lognormal distribution.
Its mathematical expression is written as:
λ(t) = eμλ(t) (2.6.35)
μλ(t) = μ5(t)σμ + mμ (2.6.36)
where μ5(t) is a colored Gaussian process and the simulation imple￾mentation process is shown in Figure 2.24. σμ, mμ are the varianceJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 89

is shown in Figure 2.28.

2.6.4.4 Simulation implementation method of Suzuki
channel model
When the weather conditions are poor (clouds and rain), the signal
propagation through the satellite channel is affected by the shadow￾ing effect and the multipath effect of the absence of direct signals,
which can be described by the Suzuki model consisting of Rayleigh
distribution and lognormal distribution [46, 47], which is given by:

where σ4 is the standard deviation of the Gaussian components in the
Rayleigh distribution, while mLN and σ2 are the mean and standard
deviation of the lognormal signal envelope σ4 obeying the lognormal
distribution, respectively. Equation (2.6.39) shows that the Suzuki
channel model is obtained by integrating the standard deviation σ4
of the Rayleigh signal envelope of Rayleigh distribution in the case
of obeying the lognormal distribution, and it can realize the trans￾formation from local characteristics to global characteristics.
The Rayleigh distribution signal envelope is multiplied with the
lognormal distribution signal envelope to obtain the signal envelopeJune 4, 2022 13:29 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch02 page 90

Multi-State Markov Chain Model for
Satellite Channels
Summary
This chapter firstly analyzes the satellite channel two-state Markov chain
model and then analyzes the satellite channel state and model in the
atmospheric environment and the ground environment. Meanwhile, the
satellite channel three-state Markov chain model, simulation method, and
Simulink system module are established. The satellite channel five-state
Markov chain model and the six-state Markov chain model outage prob￾ability of the satellite channel are analyzed by using the light shadowing,
moderate shadowing, and heavy shadowing of the ground environments.
The satellite channel Markov chain model and its simulation based on
principal component analysis and fuzzy clustering method are further
studied in transmitting.
It can be seen from Chapter 2 that the establishment of the
satellite channel model is usually based on the envelope or power
of the received signal, and the statistical model is used to describe
the channel transmission characteristics [1, 2]. In traditional chan￾nel modeling, researchers often only consider the influence of one or
two factors on the channel transmission characteristics and establish
a channel model that obeys certain statistical characteristics under
certain conditions. However, in actual satellite communication, the
transmitting signals are often affected by many external factors dur￾ing the transmission process, which may result in different degrees
of signal attenuation. In addition, the relative motion of the satellite
and the receiving terminal will cause continuous changes in the signal

transmission environment and the channel transmission characteris￾tics. Therefore, it is necessary to divide the channel state according
to the dynamics of the signal transmission environment, so that the
channel state corresponds to the transmission environment, and dif￾ferent channel states are characterized by different statistical char￾acteristics, which can establish the corresponding model and set the
corresponding model parameters. At the same time, considering the
transition of the channel state with the actual environmental changes
of the receiving terminal, it is necessary to establish a satellite chan￾nel model in a wide-area environment [3–6].
The C. Loo channel model, Suzuki channel model, Corazza
channel model, and Lutz channel model are all based on multipath
fading and shadowing fading in the ground mobile environment with￾out considering the influence of atmospheric propagation fading fac￾tors on signal transmission. However, as the operating frequency of
satellite communication systems continues to increase, the signals
are increasingly affected by various weather conditions in the atmo￾sphere [7–10]. Therefore, in order to describe the satellite channel
transmission characteristics more comprehensively, it is necessary to
comprehensively consider the satellite channel modeling problems in
the atmospheric propagation environment and the ground mobile
environment.
3.1 Satellite Channel Two-state Markov Chain Model
The channel characteristics are first analyzed and then the channel
model is established [11] when studying satellite mobile communica￾tion systems. The satellite channel model is divided into two types:
single-state model and multi-state model [12–14]. The single-state
model assumes that the envelope or power of the received signal
is subject to a statistical probability distribution with certain fixed
parameters [15, 16]. A multi-state channel model can be established
if different probability densities or different probability distributions
with different parameter settings are used to describe multiple dif￾ferent environmental states [17–19]. The most effective method to
verify the accuracy of a channel model is to compare the statisti￾cal properties of the proposed model with those of the measured
data in the actual environment. Under the premise of ensuring theJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 97
Multi-State Markov Chain Model for Satellite Channels 97
accuracy of the model, the complexity of the model implementation
should be as low as possible [20]. At present, the main technical gap
between domestic and foreign research in this field is the lack of
analysis and modeling of the test data, and it is unable to provide
models and parameters for the actual channel environment. There￾fore, based on the experimental data of the Iridium system measured
by the Communication Research Center of Harbin Institute of Tech￾nology, a two-state Markov chain model was introduced based on the
difference between the single-state model and the multi-state model
and the model parameters were fitted using the actual channel envi￾ronment.
Through the analysis of the experimental data of the Iridium
system, it was concluded that the main fading mechanism of satel￾lite mobile communication is the ground shadowing effect [21]. In
the light shadowing environment (for example, there are some tele￾graph poles on the roadside, occasionally trees, or low-density forest
areas), the fading obeys the Rice distribution with a Rice factor
of 8 dB. However, when the mobile terminal moves in a relatively
dense forest area, small villages, or narrow streets, the signal atten￾uation is obvious, up to 20–40 dB. Especially when mobile terminals
inevitably pass through some diverse physical environments (e.g.,
suburbs, cities, and open areas), the signal attenuation is more pro￾nounced. Therefore, there will be shadows and no shadows in the
propagation path, but their ratios are different.
3.1.1 Satellite channel two-state Markov chain model
in ground environment
Considering that the single-state model can only describe the single￾channel environment, the multi-state model has many parameters
and high complexity of simulation. This section presents a two-state
channel model with “ideal state” and “non-ideal state” in a wide-area
environment to overcome the shortcomings of the multi-state model.
The “ideal state” is defined as the state in which the communication
link is unaffected by shadows or only slightly shaded, in which case
communication is not interrupted. A “non-ideal state” is defined as a
state in which a communication link is severely affected by a shadow,
in which case communication is interrupted. The probability densityJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 98

function (PDF) of the total received signal envelope is written as:
f(r) = pgfg(r) + pbfb(r) (3.1.1)
where pg is the probability with the “ideal” channel, pb is the prob￾ability with the “non-ideal” channel, fg(r) is the probability density
function of the signal envelope under “ideal state”, and fb(r) is the
probability density function of the signal envelope under “non-ideal
state”.
3.1.1.1 “Ideal state” channel statistical characteristics
When the channel is “ideal”, the received signal is not affected by the
shadow or only the direct view component is affected by the slight
shadow, meanwhile, the communication is not interrupted. At this
point, the Loo model can be used to describe the channel characteris￾tics. The probability density function of the received signal envelope

3.1.1.2 “Non-ideal state” channel statistical characteristics
When the channel is “non-ideal”, the communication link is affected
by heavy shadows or full shadow fading, and the communication
is interrupted. At this time, the Corazza model is used to describe
the channel characteristics [16]. The multipath components and the
direct view component of the received signal in the Corazza model
are affected by shadowing fading, so the probability density function
of the received signal envelope r is written as:

The above analyses have shown that the PDF and the CDF of
the two-state channel model are a function of b0, mLN, σLN, K, mL,
and σL. Therefore, by adjusting these parameters, the model can
characterize the fading characteristics of the satellite mobile channels
in different channel environments.
3.1.1.3 Two-state switching
Since the two-state Markov chain model needs to dynamically switch
between “rational state” and “non-ideal state”, it is necessary to have
a switching method that can better simulate the actual situation.
Generally, the state of a random signal at a certain moment is mainly
affected by the state of the signal at the nearest neighboring moment
and little affected or even not affected by the state in which the signal
is far away from the moment. Therefore, the mathematical abstracted
Markov chain model is used to implement this random switching pro￾cess. The Markov chain has two important matrixes, one is the state
probability matrix A, which is a set of probabilities that each state
may occur under certain circumstances. Another is the state tran￾sition matrix P, which consists of the state transition probabilities.
The condition probability p{Xn+1 = j|Xn = i} indicates that when
the system is in the state i at time n, the probability of the state j
at the time n + 1 is recorded as pij (n). This condition probability,
also called the transition probability, is a one-step transition prob￾ability at time n in the Markov chain {Xn, n ∈ T}. Therefore, as
long as the state probability matrix A and the one-step transitionJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 101

probability matrix P are determined, the channel state switching
can be described [18].
Figure 3.1 is a state transition diagram between “ideal state” and
“non-ideal state”. If the current time is in a particular state, the next
state of the channel will stay in its original state or switch to the other
state. In Figure 3.1, pgg indicates the probability that the channel
remains in the “ideal state”, pbb represents the probability that the
channel stay in a “non-ideal state”, pgb represents the probability
that the channel switches from “ideal state” to “non-ideal state”,
and pbg represents the probability that the channel will switch from
“non-ideal state” to “ideal state”.
pgb = 1 − pgg pbg = 1 − pbb (3.1.7)
3.1.2 Simulation verification
Another important aspect in the study of satellite mobile communi￾cation system is the simulation of the channel model and studying the
differences between the simulation model and theoretical model of the
channel. The simulation model is a model that the computer can sim￾ulate, which is transformed from the theoretical model using software
or hardware methods, to do system performance analysis, optimiza￾tion and evaluation test, and so on. Based on the proposed channel
two-state Markov chain model, the characteristics of the channel in
“ideal state” can be the superposition of a Rayleigh random process
and a lognormal random process. While the characteristics of the
channel in “non-ideal state” can be the product of a Rician random
process and a lognormal random process. Therefore, the simulationJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 102
102 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
of Rayleigh, Rician, and lognormal random process must be done
first to simulate the two-state channel model. In the study of the
wireless fading channel characteristics, these three random processes
can be achieved by colored Gaussian process.
Figure 3.2 is a dynamic simulation block diagram of the proba￾bility model of the mobile satellite channel two-state Markov chain.
Figure 3.2 includes the Loo stochastic process under “ideal state”
and the Corazza stochastic process under “non-ideal state”, and the
Markov chain simulation module is in the lower left corner. Two
uniformly distributed random number generators can generate the
decimal between 0 and 1, switch 1 is the switch which controls the
“ideal state” to hold or switch, its threshold is pgb, while switch 2 is
the switch which controls the “non-ideal state” to hold or convert,
its threshold is pbg. The two switches are independent of each other,
and the actual Markov chain conversion is achieved by switching the
switch. It can choose to switch output signal above or below accord￾ing to the previous state. The final output signal can be used to con￾trol the switch between “ideal state” and “non-ideal state”. When the
output is “1”, “ideal state” is selected, and when the output is “0”,
“non-ideal state” is selected. Under the control of the Markov chain,
the channel characteristics can be dynamically switched between
“ideal state” and “non-ideal state” to achieve dynamic simulation
of the fading characteristics.
3.1.3 Channel model parameter fitting
The most efficient method to verify the channel model is to compare
the statistical properties of the channel model with the measured
data. At present, most research on the satellite channel model in
China analyzes and improves the foreign measured data and channel
model. The main technology gap in this area is the lack of anal￾ysis and modeling of the test data, resulting in being unable to
provide models and parameters for the actual channel environment.
From April 1999 to January 2000, the Harbin Institute of Technology
Communication Research Center used the measured Iridium system
experimental data to obtain three typical channel model parameters.
Figure 3.3(a) is a part of the open space between the Harbin and

antenna. The computer controls the instrument via a high-speed
GPIB card and records the measurement data in a file. To ensure
accurate recording of the corresponding test data, the GPS receiver
is used to determine the specific location of the measurement sites.
Here, the channel shadowing fading and multipath fading char￾acteristics are mainly studied. Therefore, the direct view component
of the received signal is first normalized to eliminate the path loss of
the measured data. The data processing is shown in Figure 3.5.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 105

In addition to the state probability matrix A and the state tran￾sition matrix P, for the channel two-state Markov chain model, it
is necessary to determine the six parameters, which are b0, mLN ,
σLN in “ideal state” and K, mL, σL in “non-ideal state”. These six
parameters are not the same in different physical environments. How￾ever, they are always related to the satellite elevation regardless of
the geographical environment. Therefore, the first-order and second￾order origin moment should be derived through numerical integration
first and then least squares error criterion and the method of linear
least squares must be used to achieve the fitting parameters of the
channel simulation model.
As is shown in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, the model parameters of dif￾ferent elevation in three typical channel environments, that is, light
shadowing environment (open space), moderate shadowing environ￾ment (rural area), and heavy shadowing environment (urban area)
were derived from quantities of repeated calculations, tests, and cor￾rections by using the least squares fitting method. Table 3.3 shows
the state probability matrix A and the state transition matrix P
corresponding to the three channel environments.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 106

is. When the shadowing increases, the average value of the received
signal envelope decreases. The received signal in the open space is
mainly the direct view component, and the several occasional deep

3.2 Satellite Channel Three-state Markov Chain Model
This section will consider the influence of atmospheric environ￾ments and ground environments on channel modeling, analyze theJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 111

characteristics of atmospheric propagation environments and ground
mobile environments, and establish a channel state model corre￾sponding to the different environments. According to the statistical
characteristics of each state of the channel, the channel state tran￾sition condition is studied, and the three-state Markov chain model
is established. In the modeling process, only the influence of signal
amplitude variation is considered, and the influence of signal phase
change is ignored.
3.2.1 Channel model in atmospheric environment
Atmospheric factors, such as atmospheric gases, clouds, and rainfall,
and so on, can cause signal attenuation in satellite communication
links. According to data analysis obtained by C. Loo et al. in Canada
for extensive testing of the Olympus satellites [22], the envelope of
signals received by the satellite is affected by the atmospheric envi￾ronment (such as clouds and rainfall), which obeys the Gaussian dis￾tribution, so the probability density function of the received signal
envelope r is written as:
fw(r) = 1
√2πσw
exp −(r − mw)2
2σ2
w

(3.2.1)
where fw(rw) is the probability density function of the signal enve￾lope under the influence of atmospheric environments. mw is the
mean of the signal envelope, and σ2
w is the variance of the signal
envelope. The probability distribution parameters of the signal enve￾lope in four typical atmospheric environments are shown in Table 3.4.
Thus, the proposed satellite channel model in the atmospheric
environments is shown in Figure 3.14, where C(t) represents the

and a variance of σ2

the real constant mw, a Gaussian distribution with a mean of mw
and a variance of σ2
w is obtained. As shown in Table 3.4, AWGN is
the additive white Gaussian noise of the channel.
3.2.2 Channel model in ground environment
In the terrestrial environment, the received signal is mainly blocked
by various obstacles on the surface of the earth to cause shadowing
fading, multipath fading caused by signal reflection, and scattering
or diffraction caused by obstacle obstructions. In order to reflect
the actual mobile satellite communication environments, in this sec￾tion, the ground mobile transmission environments are divided into
three typical physical environments: rural, suburban, and urban. In
addition, channel modeling is performed in these three environments
from the perspective of the received signal envelope [23]. At the same
time, the Markov chain is used to simulate the dynamic characteris￾tics of the channel in the terrestrial wide-area environments.
According to the characteristics of the three typical terrestrial
environmental channels and the degree to which the direct view com￾ponent is blocked and the degree of shadowing fading, the channel
states are divided into three states: no shadowing, light shadowing,
and heavy shadowing.
The unshaded state is a rural environment with a simple environ￾ment and less obstructions. Signal propagation is unaffected by any
shadowing fading, and the terminal received signal is a compositeJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 113

of multipath components and direct view components. At this time,
the envelope of the received signal obeys the Rice distribution, and
its probability density function is given by:

A light shadowing state is a relatively complicated suburban envi￾ronment with obstacles. The propagation process of the signal will
be blocked by obstacles such as trees and buildings, and multipath
fading and shadowing fading will occur. The received signal of the
terminal includes both multipath components and direct view com￾ponent affected by shadowing fading. Its probability density function

where σ2 is the Gaussian component standard deviation of the Rice
distribution, σLN is the standard deviation of the lognormal distri￾bution, and mLN is the mean of the lognormal distribution.
The heavy shadowing state is very complicated urban environ￾ments with many obstructions. During the propagation of the signal,
the direct view component is completely occluded, and only the mul￾tipath components due to obstacle obstructions exist. Meanwhile, the
multipath components are also affected by shadowing fading. At this
time, the received signal envelope can be regarded as the product
of the Rayleigh distribution and the lognormal distribution, and its
probability density function is given by:

where σ3 is the Gaussian component standard deviation of the
Rayleigh distribution, σLN is the standard deviation of the lognormal
distribution, and mLN is the mean of the lognormal distribution.
In the ground mobile environment, as the location of the mobile
terminal changes continuously, the signal transmission environment
changes among three typical physical environments, and the corre￾sponding channel state also changes. The state conversion between
two states can be realized by the Markov chain. The conversion is
only related to the previous state. The specific conversion process
between two states is shown in Figure 3.15.
The Markov chain can be described by a state transition matrix
and a state probability matrix [24], whose state transition matrix is
defined as:
P =
⎡
⎢
⎣
p11 p12 p13
p21 p22 p23
p31 p32 p33
⎤

state j, and
0 ≤ pij ≤ 1,

3
j=1
pij = 1 (3.2.6)
where i =1,2,3.
As time goes by, the Markov chain will gradually evolve to a stable
state. If the state transition matrix P is known, the state probability
matrix A = [A1 A2 A3] can be obtained by calculating under a
given initial probability matrix. A1, A2, and A3 represent the ratioJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 115
Multi-State Markov Chain Model for Satellite Channels 115
of the durations of the three states in the channel simulation, respec￾tively, and the durations of the states in the three environments are
different. As long as the state transition matrix of the actual commu￾nication environment is given, the channel statistical characteristics
in the ground environment can be simulated according to the channel
model.
According to the above analyses, the probability density function
of the received signal envelope of the satellite channel three-state
Markov chain model under the ground environment is obtained by
the Equations (3.2.2), (3.2.2), and (3.2.4), i.e.,
fg(r) = A1f1(r) + A2f2(r) + A3f3(r) (3.2.7)
where A1, A2, and A3 are the proportions of the three states, respec￾tively, and A1 + A2 + A3 = 1.
Figure 3.16 shows a block diagram of the satellite channel three￾state Markov chain model in a terrestrial mobile environment, where
C(t) represents the multiplicative interference of the channel under
the influence of the ground mobile environment. The Rice dis￾tribution module describes the multipath fading characteristics of
the channel in the unshaded state, the Rice–lognormal distribu￾tion module describes the channel fading characteristics in the rela￾tively complicated environment with light shadowing fading, and the
Rayleigh–lognormal distribution module describes the fading char￾acteristics of the channel in heavy shadowing states. The Markov
chain conversion process enables switching between the two states of
the channel caused by constant changes in the ground environment.
AWGN represents additive white Gaussian noise of the channel.

and g denotes the influence of the ground environment on the sig￾nal transmission and the terminal receiving signal can be expressed
as r = wg. According to probability theory, the probability density

The statistical characteristic parameters of the channel model are the

link in channel research, and the designed channel simulation model
must be infinitely close to the theoretical model, so as to obtain an
accurate and effective simulation of the satellite channel [26].
3.2.5.1 Markov chain state transition implementation
When the weather conditions have a certain impact on signal trans￾mission in the atmospheric propagation environments, as the mobile
receiving terminal switches among three physical environments with
different topographical features, the transmission characteristics of
the channel are continuously changing. In the modeling and simula￾tion of the channel multi-state, the changing process of the channel
states is realized by Markov chain [27].
The state transition process of the channel three-state Markov
chain model of the satellite channel in the ground environments,
shown in Figure 3.16, can be divided into three sub-modules, as
shown in Figure 3.18.
In Figure 3.18, U1(0, 1), U2(0, 1), and U3(0, 1) are random number
generators, which are uniformly distributed and independent of each
other in the interval [0 1] and whose generation frequency of theJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 122
122 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
random number is determined by the change speed of the mobile
terminal environment. s1, s2, and s3 are the channel states in the
three ground environments, respectively, and the selection thresholds
of switches K1, K2, and K3 are the transition probabilities of the
different channel states, respectively. The transition implementation
of the three shadowing states is as follows:
(1) When the current state is s1, the selection switch K1 is oper￾ated, and the switches K2 and K3 are suspended. If the random
number generated by U1(0, 1) is less than or equal to p11, the
s1 state remains unchanged. If the random number generated by
U1(0, 1) is greater than p11 and less than p11 + p12, the switch
K1 is turned to the s2 state, otherwise the switch K1 is turned
to the s3 state.
(2) When the current state is s2, the selection switch K2 is oper￾ated, and the switches K1 and K3 are suspended. If the random
number generated by U2(0, 1) is greater than p23, then switch
K2 turns to the s3 state. If the random number generated by
U2(0, 1) is less than p21, then switch K2 turns to the s1 state,
otherwise it continues to maintain the s2 state.
(3) When the current state is s3, the selection switch K3 is operated,
and the switches K2 and K1 are suspended. If the random num￾ber generated by U3(0, 1) is less than or equal to p31, the switch
K3 is turned to the s1 state. If the random number generated by
U3(0, 1) is greater than p31 and less than p31 + p32, the switch
K1 is turned to the s2 state, otherwise the switch K3 is turned
to the s3 state.
(4) Referring to above from step (1) to step (3), the mutual conver￾sion among three different channel states can be achieved.
Thus, according to the given initial channel state and the cor￾responding state transition matrix, the simulation of the channel
dynamics can be achieved in the manner shown in Figure 3.18.
3.2.5.2 Implementation method of satellite channel Markov
chain model
The simulation of the satellite channel Markov chain model is
obtained by the combined calculation of the real Gaussian process,
as shown in Figure 3.19.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 123

and ξ1(t) is the process of the signal affected by the ground-free

and the product of ξ2(t) and λ1(t) yields a Rice–lognormal process to
describe the effect of a light shadowing ground environment on the

Experiment 3.1: For the different channel models established by
the influence of three typical ground environments on the channel
characteristics, the parameters of the corresponding channel simu￾lation model were selected, and the QPSK modulated signals were
used as the input to the channels of three different shadowing levels
to obtain the output signals, as shown in Figure 3.20.
It can be seen from Figure 3.20 that there is the attenuation or dis￾tortion of signal in different physical environments. In the shadowlessJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 125

rural environment, the constellation points of the received signals in
the simulation model are relatively compact and the signal fading is
small, in the suburban environment with light shadows, the constel￾lation points of the received signals in the simulation model are more
divergent, and the degree of signal fading increases to some extent,
and under heavy shadowing urban environment, the constellation
points of the received signals in the simulation model are heavily
divergent and the signal attenuation is greater.
In designing simulation of the actual system, the transition
between channel states should be determined by the specific actual
environment, and the changing physical environment will have a
great impact on state transition. Therefore, the parameters in [28]
are selected here as simulation data. The state transition matrix is
given by:
P =
⎡
⎢
⎣
0.8628 0.0737 0.0635
0.1247 0.8214 0.0539

⎥
⎦
Under the initial distribution of the equal probability, the Markov
chain will gradually evolve into a steady state over time, and the dis￾tribution curves of the state probability converges to the steady-state
distribution process, as shown in Figure 3.21. It is known from Fig￾ure 3.21 that the state probability matrix consisting of the proportion
of the channel state durations of the three different degrees of theJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 126

A = [0.4 0.2667 0.3333]
As mobile receiving terminals continue to change, the channel
transmission environment will change. Figure 3.22 shows the simula￾tion results of the received signal envelope of the three-state Markov
chain model in the ground mobile environment. Figure 3.22 shows
that there are three distinct degrees of the received signal fading,
which simulates the transmission characteristics of the different chan￾nels in a wide-area environment.
Figure 3.23 shows the probability density function (PDF) and
the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) for the
three-state Markov chain model. It can be seen from Figure 3.23 that
the built-in three-state Markov chain simulation model has a good
agreement with the statistical characteristics of the theoretical model
and the rationality of the channel three-state Markov chain model in
the ground mobile environment is effectively verified.
Experiment 3.2: The built-in satellite channel Markov chain
model is simulated according to the simulation method shown in
Figure 3.19. In the simulation, the relevant parameters in the atmo￾spheric environments were given in Table 3.4, along with the simula￾tion parameters in the ground environment without shadowing, light
shadowing state, and heavy shadowing state, as shown in Table 3.5.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 127

simulation results that the larger the shadowing fading is, the more
serious the signal attenuation is and the worse the satellite commu￾nication quality is.

atmospheric environments in three different shaded ground envi￾ronments, that is, probability density function (PDF) and comple￾mentary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) are shown from
Figure 3.27 to Figure 3.29. It has been seen from Figure 3.27 to
Figure 3.29 that the simulation results are very similar to the theoret￾ical analysis results, and in the same ground environment, the signal
fading under cumulus weather is more serious than in the light rain
weather.
Figures 3.30 and 3.31 show the statistical characteristics of the
satellite channel Markov chain model and the satellite channel model
without being affected by the atmospheric environment. It can be
seen from Figures 3.30 and 3.31 that the simulation results of the two
channel models are basically consistent with the theoretical model,
and the signal attenuation ratio of the satellite channel Markov chain
model is serious when the atmospheric environment and the ground
environment are considered, that is, in case the atmospheric environ￾ment and the ground environment are also considered, the satellite
channel Markov chain model is reasonable.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 130

and the direct view component, the envelope of the synthesized
signal at this time obeys the Rice distribution. If the direct view
component does not exist, then the envelope of the received sig￾nal is subject to the Rayleigh distribution. Both the Rayleigh
process and the Rice process are based on two uncorrelated
real Gaussian processes. The specific mathematical expression
is written as:
ζ(t) = |μ1(t) + jμ2(t)| (3.2.24)
ξ(t) = |μ1(t) + jμ2(t) + m(t)| (3.2.25)
where μ1(t) and μ2(t) are real Gaussian processes and m(t) is
a direct view component. In order to facilitate the simulation
implementation, in the establishment of the Rice distribution
simulation module, the direct view component m(t) is regarded
as a unchanged constant. Therefore, the implementation method
of the Rice distribution simulation module in the Simulink plat￾form is shown in Figure 3.34. When the constant module A is
taken to zero, a simulation module of the Rayleigh distribution
can be obtained.
The implementation of the Gaussian signal generation module
in Figure 3.34 is shown in Figure 3.33. Among them, the Doppler
parameters cn, fn, and θn are calculated by Equations (3.2.21)
and (3.2.22).June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 135

(3) Simulation module of lognormal distribution: It is known from
the relationship between the lognormal distribution and the
Gaussian distribution that if the stochastic process x obeys the
Gaussian distribution, y = ex obeys a lognormal distribution.
Therefore, the specific method, generating the lognormal distri￾bution process, is to first generate a Gaussian distribution pro￾cess and then perform an exponential transformation to obtain
the lognormal distribution process.
Therefore, in the Simulink environment, the simulation module of
random signal obeying lognormal distribution is obtained by using
Gaussian distribution, as shown in Figure 3.35. The Gaussian ran￾dom signal generator x with the zero mean and unity variance in the
Simulink module library is transferred to get the lognormal distribu￾tion simulation module with the specified mean value and variance
through σν(t) + mu and exponential operation.
3.2.5.4.2 Satellite channel three-state Markov chain model
In this section, the Simulink implementation of the channel module
in the atmospheric environments and the ground environments is
carried out, and the simulation model of the satellite channel Markov
chain model is also established based on the consideration of the
atmospheric environments and the ground environments.

atmospheric environments can be described by a Gaussian distri￾bution. Therefore, the simulation module of the channel model

depicted in Figure 3.33 is shown in Figure 3.36. The channel
characteristics simulation under different atmospheric conditions
can be achieved by setting the parameters of the Gaussian noise
generator module.
In Figure 3.36, set the simulation time to 10 s, double-click
the “Gaussian Noise Generator module”, set the sampling time
ts = 0.01, and the initial seed number is 61. The channel model
parameters under the thunderstorm weather are selected as m =
0.436 and σ2 = 0.01386 from Table 3.4. The Simulink simulation
results can be observed from the oscilloscope module scope, as
shown in Figure 3.37.
(2) Simulation module of the channel model under the ground envi￾ronment: The channel statistical properties affected by the
ground environment can be described by a combination of
Rayleigh distribution, Rice distribution, and lognormal distri￾bution. Therefore, the simulation module of the channel model
under the ground propagation environment in Simulink platform
can be established by using the simulation module of both the
Rice or Rayleigh distribution and the lognormal distribution,
constructed in Figures 3.34 and 3.35, as shown in Figure 3.38.

the statistical characteristics of the ground-free shadowing chan￾nel, the product of the Rice distribution and the lognormal distri￾bution is used to describe the channel statistical characteristicsJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 137

under the light shadowing fading ground environment, and the
product of the Rayleigh distribution and the lognormal distri￾bution is used to describe the channel statistical characteristics
under the heavy shadowing fading ground environment. As the
signal transmission environment changes, the channel state tran￾sitions among unshadowing, light shadowing, and heavy shad￾owing states will occur. This transformation is a Markov chain
process, as shown in Figure 3.39.
The random number generator in the Simulink module library
is selected to generate three numbers that obeys uniform distri￾bution in [0,1]. Switch1, switch2, and switch3 are the channel
state hold and transfer switches in the three shadowing states,
the threshold of the three switches is related to the transition
matrix of the channel states, and the three switches switch inde￾pendently. The real Markov transformation process is realized
by switch0. According to the previous state, switch0 selects the
output signal of the switch1, the switch2, or the switch3, and its
output is used to control the channel state transition under no
shadowing, light shadowing, and heavy shadowing states. If the
output of switch0 is 1, the channel model without shadowing is
selected. If the output of switch0 is 2, the channel model with
light shadowing is selected. Otherwise, the channel model with
heavy shadowing is selected.
In Figure 3.39, “1–1” indicates that the channel remains
unchanged in the unshadowing state, “1–2” represents the tran￾sition from the unshadowing state to the light shadowing state,
and “1–3” denotes the transition from the unshadowing state
to the heavy shadowing state. The meaning of other modules is
similar.

(3) Satellite channel Markov chain model simulation system: In
order to verify the correctness and reasonableness of the satellite
channel Markov model considering both the atmospheric envi￾ronments and the ground environments, a simulation model of
the satellite communication system based on the channel model
is established, and the bit error rate (BER) characteristics of
the output signal are analyzed. The overall block diagram of the
satellite communication system is shown in Figure 3.41.
As shown in Figure 3.41, the data sources of the transmitting
end are generated by the Random Integer Generator module, and
the signals are modulated by the QPSK modulator and entered into
the channel model for comprehensive description. Here, it is assumed
that the channel fading is slow and there is no other fading effect.
Finally, the fading signal output of the channel is demodulated by
QPSK and then output to the BER statistical unit, which ana￾lyzes the generated bit error results. The specific implementation
of Simulink is shown in Figure 3.42.
3.2.5.4.3 Simulation verification
In the simulation of the satellite communication system, the QPSK
signal is affected by both channel multiplicative interference and
additive white Gaussian noise. The multiplicative interference is gen￾erated by the established channel model, and the additive white
Gaussian noise is generated by the AWGN module. After the output
of the channel is demodulated by the QPSK demodulator, the out￾put signal is obtained and input to the BER calculation module to
analyze the BER characteristics.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 141

In Figure 3.42, the data source module, QPSK modulation or

can all be called from the Simulink model library.
The simulation time is set to 10 s, the sample value of the signal
generator and AWGN module is set to 0.001, the relevant parameter
settings of the integrated channel are shown in Tables 3.4 and 3.5,
and the Bit Error Rate Analysis Toolbox (BERTool) in Simulink is
called to analyze satellite communication system simulation result.
The specific simulation results are shown in Figure 3.43.
Figure 3.43(a) shows the BER curves of the channel model simula￾tion system under four typical weather conditions: cloudy, cumulus,
thunderstorm, and light rain when the signal is transmitted with￾out considering the ground environment. Compared with the AWGN
channel, the signal affected by four typical weather conditions will
be fading, and the signal attenuation is minimal in light rain condi￾tions, and the signal attenuation is much heavier in thunderstorms
and cumulus weathers, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
simulation system is greater than 15 dB, and also the signal atten￾uations in the thunderstorm weather are greater than the cumulusJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 142

weather. Therefore, rainfall attenuation should be taken into account
when studying the transmission characteristics of satellite channel
under high-frequency band.
Figure 3.43(b) shows the BER curves of the channel model simu￾lation system under the ground environments when the signal is not
affected by weather conditions. From the BER curves, as the signal
is affected by the shadowing fading, the BER is gradually increased,
and the signal attenuation is more and more serious.
Figure 3.43(c) is the BER curves of the channel model simulation
system under four typical weather conditions: cloudy, cumulus, thun￾derstorm, and light rain when the signal is transmitted under without
shadowing ground environment, the signal attenuation is still mini￾mal in light rain, but more serious under thunderstorms and cumulus
weather. The larger the SNR is, the more serious the thunderstorm
weather signal attenuation is, at this time, the BER curves tend to
be horizontal and straight, which indicates that the system’s BER
performance can no longer be significantly improved.
Figures 3.43(d) and 3.43(e) are the BER curves of the chan￾nel model simulation system under four typical weather conditions:
cloudy, cumulus, thunderstorm, and light rain when the signal is
transmitted in the light shadowing and heavy shadowing ground envi￾ronment. From the BER curves, the signal fading law is consistent
with the unshadowing environment under four typical weather condi￾tions, but the signal attenuation is significantly increased compared
with the unshadowing environment.
Figure 3.43(f) is the BER curves of the channel model simula￾tion system under four typical weather conditions: cloudy, cumulus,
thunderstorm, and light rain when the signal is transmitted in the
terrestrial wide-area environment. From the approximation trend of
the BER curves under four typical weather conditions, the influence
of the atmospheric environments on signal attenuation is relatively
small but cannot be neglected compared with the signal attenuation
effect of the ground environments.
Based on the analyses of the BER characteristics of the satellite
communication simulation system, when considering both the atmo￾spheric environments and the ground environments, the established
Markov chain model of the satellite channel is reasonable and fea￾sible and can be used as the theoretical basis for the design and
improvement of the satellite communication system.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 144

3.3 Satellite Channel Five-state Markov Chain Model
In this section, based on the three states of light shadowing, mod￾erate shadowing, and heavy shadowing ground moving environment,
the satellite channel five-state Markov chain model is studied. There
are “good state”, “not bad state”, and “bad state”, where “good
state” and “bad state” have also two sub-states, and the transition
probabilities are also derived. This model is easier to be simulated
and can be easily applied to complex satellite links [30–35].
3.3.1 Five-state Markov chain model
3.3.1.1 Transfer model
Figure 3.44 shows a channel five-state Markov chain model. In the
Gilbert–Elliot channel Markov model and the three-state Markov
chain model, there are three shadowing areas: light shadowing areas
(state 1), moderate shadowing areas (state 2), and heavy shadow￾ing areas (state 3). The light shadowing areas (state 1) have two

sub-states (sub-states 1, 2), and the heavy shadowing areas (state 3)
also have two sub-states (sub-states 4, 5). The light shadowing areas
can convert to moderate shadowing area, but not directly to light
shadowing area. The heavy shadowing areas can convert to mod￾erate shadowing areas, but not directly to heavy shadowing areas.
When the received signal is in the light shadowing area or heavy
shadowing area for a period of time, the state can transfer between
the two sub-states.
The Markov chain part of the model defines three states for each
tape of environment plus elevation angle combination representing
the following link conditions:
Light shadowing areas:
State 1: LOS conditions
State 2: Light shadowing conditions
Moderate shadowing areas:
State 3: Moderate shadowing conditions
Heavy shadowing areas:
State 4: Heavy shadowing conditions
State 5: Full shadowing conditions.
At a given time or path location, the Markov chain model can use
two matrices to describe the LMS channel:
(1) The state probability matrix is denoted as A.
(2) The state transition probability matrix is denoted as P.
In the channel five-state Markov chain model, there are five states,
and the transition probability matrix is given by:
P =
⎡
⎢

In Figure 3.44, it is impossible for the state 1 or the state 2
to transfer to the state 4 or the state 5 directly, and the MarkovJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 146

simplified as:

where pij represents the transition probability from the state i to the
state j, and i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and further 6
j=1 pij = 1, 0 ≤ pij ≤ 1.
The state probability matrix A indicates the probabilities of all
states and is written as A = {A1, A2, A3, A4, A5}. This Markov chain
is aperiodic, irreducible, and normal regressive, so its steady-state
probability distribution exists and is equal to the limit distribution.
Then,
AP = A
So, if the state transition probability matrix P is known, a state
probability matrix A can be obtained. Matrix P and matrix A are
related to many factors such as incidence angle, environments, and
other factors.
3.3.1.2 Shadowing fading model
According to the Lutz model and the satellite channel three-state
Markov chain model, the satellite channels are divided into three
states: “good state”, “not good and not bad state”, and “bad state”.
A “good state” is a clear LOS link without shadowing or light shad￾owing, which is subject to the Rician distribution. The “ not good and
not bad state” is affected by moderate shadowing and belongs to the
Loo distribution. The “bad state” is affected by heavy shadowing or
full shadowing and belongs to the Rayleigh–lognormal distribution.
The probability density function (PDF) of the Rayleigh–
lognormal distribution is written as:

I0(2K(1 + K)s) (3.3.3)
where K is a Rice factor and defined as the ratio of the power in the
LOS path to the power in the diffuse paths.
The PDF of the received power in satellite channel five-state
Markov chain model is the weighted of the PDF fRice(S) of the Rice
distribution, the PDF fLoo(S) of the Loo distribution, and the PDF
fRayl−L(S) of the Rayleigh–lognormal distribution.
f(S) = A1f Rice1 (S) + A2f Rice2 (S) + A3f Loo (S) + A4f Rayl−L1 (S)

3.3.1.3 State division
The measured data used in this section was measured in a narrow
street in the old town of Munich [36].
In Figure 3.45, the state samples are distinguished by dividing the
received signal envelope. The received signals from −10 dB to −20 dB
indicate state 3. The received signals from −10 dB to maximum are
divided into the state 1 and the state 2 uniformly. The received sig￾nals from −20 dB to minimum are divided into the state 4 and the
state 5 uniformly.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 148

3.3.2 Simulation tests
The simulation of the satellite channel five-state Markov chain model
is compared with the measured data shown in Figure 3.45 and the
simulation of the satellite channel six-state Markov chain model.
Matrix A can be obtained from the state transition probability
matrix P, which is shown in Table 3.6. According to the measured
data of each state, the parameters of the satellite channel five-state
Markov chain model are obtained by statistical fitting method, as
shown in Table 3.7. The five-state Markov chain model and the
CDF of the six-state Markov chain model are shown in Figure 3.46.
Figure 3.47 shows the normalized level crossover rate. Figure 3.48
showed the normalized average fading duration (AFD). The BER of
the new five-state Markov model and the five-state Markov model
is simulated by the method in [37]. The average BER is shown in
Figure 3.49.
In comparison, the simulated CDF, LCR, and AFD based on the
five-state are more consistent with the measurement ones than ones
based on the six-state model. Both the five-state Markov chain model
and the six-state Markov chain model can accurately represent the
actual channel, but the five-state Markov chain model has smaller
average BER, which is more suitable for cities and suburbs. So it has
practical significance.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 150

These six states are divided into the “good” or “bad” two-state
model, whereas the “good” or “bad” state is also divided into three
sub-states. The fading in the “good” state is relatively benign and
is represented by the Rician distribution. The fading in the “bad”
state is modeled by the Rayleigh–lognormal distribution and called
as the Suzuki distribution. However, in these studies, the outage
probability is not analyzed, and its effective analysis method is not
given. An analysis method of the outage probability and the CDFJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 152
152 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
of the Rician distribution was given in [39]. The described method
was used to analyze the outage probability and CDF of the channel
six-state Markov chain model of the satellite, and the closed-loop
formulas for CDF and outage probability [40] were found finally.
3.4.1 Analysis of satellite channel six-state Markov
chain model
Assuming slow fading, the received signal of the nth transmitted
symbol is written as:
y(n) = s(n)x(n) + w(n) (3.4.1)
where x(n) is the first received signal and n = 1,2,..., w(n) is additive
white Gaussian noise, and s(n) is channel gain. The received power
in the attenuation envelope is given by P = |s|
2 = s2
I + s2
Q. In a
non-attenuating environment, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) γ is
defined as:
γ = E[|x(n)|
2]/N0 = Es/N0 (3.4.2)
It can be seen from Equation (3.4.2) that when attenuation
occurs, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is γS. When the channel
states are in the substate 1, 2, 3 of the “good” state, the envelope of
the attenuation belongs to the Rice distribution, and the fractional
times are A1, A2, and A3, respectively. The Rice factors are K1, K2,
and K3, respectively. When the channel states are in the substate 1,
2, 3 of the “bad” state (named them as “state 4, 5, 6”), the envelope
of the attenuation belongs to the Rayleigh–lognormal distribution,
and the mean and standard deviation are m2, σ1, m2, σ2, m3, and
σ3, respectively. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the Rice
distribution and the Rayleigh–lognormal distribution are denoted as
f rice (s) and fRayL (s), respectively. So, the joint probability density
function of energy (S) is defined as:
f(s) = A1fRice1(s) + A2fRice2(s) + A3fRice3(s) + A4fRay L1(s)
+ A5fRay L2(s) + A6fRay L3(s) (3.4.3)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 153
Multi-State Markov Chain Model for Satellite Channels 153
where A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 = 1. So, the CDF of S is defined
as:
F(S) = A1FRice1(S) + A2FRice2(S) + A3FRice3(S) + A4FRay L1(S)
+ A5FRay L2(S) + A6FRay L3(S) (3.4.4)
where FRice1 and FRay L represent the CDF of the Rice distribution
and the Rayleigh–lognormal distribution.
3.4.1.1 Several distributions
3.4.1.1.1 Rice distribution
Due to the fading characteristics of the channel, the diffusers and
reflectors on the receiver and transmitter can cause LOS path and
multipath components. The Rice factor K is the signal power ratio of
the LOS component to the multipath component. The amplitude of
the received signal on the Rice channel follows the Rice distribution,
and its PDF is known [36]. Then, the PDF of the received signal
power is calculated by:
fRice(s) = (1 + K)e−[K+(1+K)s]
I0(2K(1 + K)s) (3.4.5)
Here, it is assumed that the average received power is 1. The CDF
of the Rice channel is written as:
FRice(S)=1 − Q(
√
2K,2(1 + K)S) (3.4.6)
where Q(
√
2K,2(1 + K)S) is the Marcum’s Q function in [41].
When K is zero, the standardized PDF and CDF of the Rayleigh
distribution are obtained by Equations (3.4.5) and (3.4.6). Equa￾tion (3.4.5) can be rewritten as:

3.4.1.1.2 Rayleigh–lognormal distribution
The Rayleigh–lognormal distribution characterizes the combined
effects of the Rayleigh fading and lognormal shadowing and estab￾lishes a shadowing multipath channel without LOS path. The
received power is subject to a Rayleigh distribution with a local
average received power of S0, which obeys the lognormal distribu￾tion. Therefore, the PDF of the fading received power in Rayleigh–
lognormal is defined as:
fRay L(s) =  ∞
0
fRayl(s/S0)fLog(S0)dS0 (3.4.8)
fLog(s0) = 10
ln 10

√2πδ (3.4.9)
where x = 10 log
√ s0−m
2δ .
From the literature [36], the PDF of the Rayleigh fading can
be obtained. From Equations (3.4.8) and (3.4.9), the Rayleigh–
lognormal distribution function can be written by Hermite integra￾tion as:
FRay L(S) = 1
√π
n
i=1
wi(1 − e

∂i ) + Rn (3.4.10)
where ∂i = 10
√2δxi+μ
10 . xi and wi are the abscissa and weight of the
ith term of the nth-order Hermite polynomial, respectively. Rn is a
residual term that can be ignored when δ < 7 dB (the proof process
is in [41]).
3.4.1.2 Maximum ratio combined diversity reception
Of any known linear diversity combiner, the maximum ratio com￾bining (MRC) has the best statistical attenuation of multipath
fading. Each signal is weighted proportionally to their SNR and
then summed. For L-branch diversity, the total signal power S is
the sum of the received signal powers si(i = 1,...,L) from each
antenna [42].June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 155

fRayl(s1/S0)··· fRayl(sL/S0)fLog(S0)dS0 (3.4.13)
where s1 + s2 + ··· + sL = s.

in the desired form as:

where Rn can be ignored when δ < 7dB (the proof process is in [41]).
3.4.1.3 Outage probability
In general, a more useful measure of transmission quality is the out￾age probability P. It represents the percentage of time that the
instantaneous BER is above an acceptable threshold ε. Therefore,June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 156

it can be written as:
pout = Pr[S < S] = F(S)
If using BPSK or DPSK, then
SB = 1
r
[erfc−1(2ε)]2 (3.4.15)
SD = ln(2ε)

When the MRC diversity reception is not used, the outage prob￾ability of the six-state Markov chain model is given by:
pout(γ) = F(S) = A1FRice1(S) + A2FRice2(S) + A3FRice3(S)
+A4FRay L1(S) + A5FRay L2(S) + A6FRay L3(S) (3.4.17)
When using MRC diversity reception, the outage probability is
given by:

Rice1 (S) + A2F MRC
Rice2 (S) + A3F MRC
Rice3 (Sb)
+ A4F MRC
Ray L1 (Sb) + A5F MRC
Ray L2 (S) + A6F MRC
Ray L2 (S)
(3.4.18)
The outage probability can be obtained by combining
Equations (3.4.15), (3.4.17), and (3.4.18) when using BPSK mod￾ulation. The outage probability can be obtained by combining Equa￾tions (3.4.16), (3.4.17), and (3.4.18) when using DPSK modulation.

corresponding to the measurement result were shown in Table 3.9.
The two-state stability probabilities and the parameters associated
with P were shown in Table 3.10. Figure 3.50 compared the six￾state CDF from theory, simulation, and measurement. Under MRC
diversity and no diversity, the outage probability of the BPSK was
shown in Figures 3.51 and 3.52. In Figure 3.51, the received SNR was
15 dB. In Figure 3.52, the expected threshold was 10−2. Figures 3.53
and 3.54 used the DPSK model. The other conditions were the same
as those in Figures 3.51 and 3.52.
When using BPSK or DPSK modulation, the outage probability
of the six-state Markov chain model was theoretically analyzed. The
closed-loop equation simplified calculations made simulations easy to
be done. When the MRC diversity was used to obtain the closed-loop
formula, the average outage probability of the six-state Markov chain
model was also theoretically analyzed. This analysis method could
be applied to other Markov chain models. When BPSK or DPSK
modulation was used, the outage probability of the six-state Markov
chain model was compared with that of the two-state Markov chainJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 158

theoretical support. In view of the above problems, in this section,
the principal component analysis (PCA) method is combined with
the fuzzy clustering method to study the satellite channel modeling
method. The main idea is shown in Figure 3.55.
3.5.1 Analysis of key influencing factors in satellite
channel modeling
The principal component analysis (PCA) method for the key influ￾encing factors of satellite channel modeling [42, 43] is as follows:
firstly, the channel propagation characteristics in a specific case are
analyzed, and the relevant factors are quantified; secondly, the PCA
method is used to process the quantized data to obtain the mainJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 161
Multi-State Markov Chain Model for Satellite Channels 161
influencing factors on the satellite channel modeling; finally, a satel￾lite channel model is established. The specific steps are as follows:
Step 1: The propagation characteristics of satellite channel under
specific conditions are analyzed and the relevant physical
quantities are calibrated.
First, the relevant physical quantities are quantitatively
labeled as free space loss Lf , Rice factor c0, amplitude
flicker index S4, atmospheric absorption loss Agas, rain
attenuation Arain, cloud and fog attenuation Ac, depolar￾ization effect XPD, Doppler shift fd, etc.
Step 2: The original parameters and data are collected.
The original parameters and data of the concerned link
are collected. Suppose that the data of the original parame￾ters of the link has n samples, and there are p indexes in the
samples (that is, the physical quantity needed to study the
propagation characteristics of the link). The jth parameter
observation value of the ith sample is recorded as xij , then
the original data matrix is written as:
X = (xij )n×p =
⎡

(3.5.1)
where i = 1, 2,...,n; j = 1, 2,...,p.
Step 3: Original data standardization
In the PCA, it is necessary for solving the principal com￾ponent to calculate the covariance matrix. The accuracy of
covariance matrix is affected by the dimension and order
of magnitude of the parameters. Therefore, when calculat￾ing the covariance matrix, the original data is first nor￾malized to make it become a dimensionless quantity. The
standardized data is denoted as (˜xij )n×p and its element ˜xij
is given by:
x˜ij = xij − x¯j
σj

where Fr is the rth principal component, and apr is the

3.5.2 Analysis of satellite channel state number
From the above analyses, the satellite channel single-state model can￾not effectively describe the characteristics of the satellite channel
in changing environments. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a
satellite channel multi-state model. When establishing a multi-state
model of the satellite channel, it is very important to determine the
number of the channel states. If the number of states is too small, the
propagation characteristics of the satellite channel cannot be accu￾rately described. If the number of states is too large, the amount
of calculation is large and the real-time performance is poor. In the
past, relevant scholars divided satellite channels into specific states
based on their experiences, which lacked theoretical basis. In this
section, the number of satellite channel states is determined by fuzzy
clustering analysis [44] and F-distribution. The specific steps are as
follows:
Step 1: Get the original data matrix.
It is known from Equation (3.5.9) that there are the r main
factors affecting channel modeling. The coefficient matrix
of the simultaneous Equation (3.5.9) can be expressed as
W = [F1, F2,...,Fr] = {wij}n×r, that is, the original dataJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 164

matrix for the cluster analysis can be expressed as:
W =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
w11 w12 ··· w1r
w21 w22 ··· w2r
··· ··· ···
wn1 wn2 ··· wnr
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠
(3.5.10)
where wij represents the jth element of the ith line, n is
the number of indicators, and r is the number of principal
components.
Step 2: Data standardization.
In establishing the satellite channel model, different factors
have different properties and different dimensions, which
cannot meet the requirements of fuzzy clustering. There￾fore, the original data matrix W needs to be standardized
before clustering, that is, it must be transformed into a
dimensionless fuzzy matrix. After using a shift and range
transformation, the standardization data are obtained as
follows:
w
ij =
wij − min
1≤i≤n
(wij )
max
1≤i≤n
(wij ) − min
1≤i≤n
(wij ) (3.5.11)
where min(•)and max(•) denote the minimum and the max￾imum of wij , respectively, and w
ij is the transformed data.
After transforming, the matrix W is written as:
W =
⎡

⎦
(3.5.12)
Step 3: Establish the similar matrix.
There are many methods to establish similar matrices. Here,
according to the characteristics of the satellite channel data,
the similar matrix is established by the included angleJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 165

k=1
w 2
ik ·

k=1
w 2
jk
(3.5.13)
where i, j has the same meaning as above, and thus the
fuzzy similar matrix is obtained and denoted as Rij =
(rij )n×n.
Step 4: Dynamic fuzzy clustering.
In the process of fuzzy clustering, the fuzzy equivalent
matrix is usually required to have reflexivity, transitivity,
and symmetry, while the actual equivalent matrix usually
has reflexivity and symmetry. Therefore, it is necessary to
transform the existing matrix into an equivalent matrix
with reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry. In this section,
the square automorphism method is used to transform the
existing similarity matrix R. The specific transformation
process is as follows:
R → R2 → R4 →···→ R2(k+1) = R2k (3.5.14)
R2 = R◦R = (r
ij )m×m, r
ij = m
max
k=1 (min(rij , rji))
(3.5.15)
t(R) = R2k = (tij )m×m (3.5.16)
The different numerical elements in the fuzzy equivalence
matrix t(R) are arranged from large to small, and the
threshold λ is selected according to this arrangement, then
the dynamic clustering graph of the number of the satellite
channel states can be formed.
Step 5: Determine the optimal number of clusters.
In previous related studies, the number of clusters was
determined by adjusting the λ value. The clustering results
of this method depend on man’s subjective will and λ. In
this section, the optimal threshold λ is first determined by
F-statistics [45], and then the clustering of the samples is
carried out according to the λ value in the dynamic clus￾tering graph, and finally the best classification number isJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 166
166 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
obtained. This method can effectively overcome the defi￾ciencies of man’s subjective will and make the determined
number of clusters be more objective and effective. The spe￾cific calculation process is as follows:
First, the center vector x¯k of the original data matrix
sample is calculated by:
x¯k = 1
n
n
i=1
xik (3.5.17)
where k = 1, 2,...,m.
Let the classification number corresponding to the λ value
be r, the number of the samples of the j class be nj , the
sample of the j class be x(j)
1 , x(j)
2 ,...,x(j) nj , and the clustering
center of the j class x¯(j) = (x¯(j)
1 , x¯(j)
2 ,..., x¯(j) nj ), x¯(j)
1 =
1
nj
n
i=1 x(j)
ik , so F-statistics is defined as:
F =

· (r − 1)
∼ F(r − 1, n − r)
(3.5.18)
where the numerator represents the distance between
the classes, and the denominator represents the distance
between the samples within the class. Therefore, the larger
the F value is, the greater the distance between the classes
is, and the better the classification effect is. If F >
Fα(r − 1, n − r)(α = 0.05), the difference between classes
is significant based on the theory of variance analysis of
mathematical statistics, which indicates that the classifica￾tion result is reasonable. If there is more than one value of
α satisfying the inequality F >Fα(r − 1, n − r), the size of
(F − Fα) may be further examined to find a satisfactory F
value from the larger one.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 167
Multi-State Markov Chain Model for Satellite Channels 167
3.5.3 Multi-state Markov chain model for satellite
channels
In the actual satellite communication, due to the frequent changes
of the surrounding environment (weather changes, clouds, and the
movement of the receiving terminal), the channel propagation char￾acteristics are unstable and the channel state is constantly changing.
At this time, it is obviously unreasonable to use the channel single￾state model to describe the channel characteristics. Many scholars
used the channel multi-state model to describe the dynamic changes
of the channel, but the traditional channel multi-state model could
not accurately predict the channel state at a certain time and skill￾fully unify multiple states into one model, which has poor practica￾bility [46–57].
In this section, on the basis of fully studying the traditional chan￾nel multi-state Markov chain model, the number of satellite chan￾nel states is determined by principal component analysis (PCA) and
fuzzy clustering method, and the satellite channel multi-state Markov
chain model is established, which can not only overcome the sharp
increase of computation caused by too many states but also avoid
the problem that too few states cannot fully describe the channel
characteristics and find the best balance between the two. The pro￾cess of establishing satellite channel multi-state Markov model is as
follows:
Step 1: Determine the channel single-state statistical model.
It is assumed that the optimal cluster number n of the
satellite channel states in a certain region is obtained by
fuzzy clustering method, that is, the link channel can be
divided into n states. Among them, the first satellite chan￾nel obeys the Rayleigh distribution, the second obeys the
Suzuki distribution, and the third obeys the Rice distri￾bution,. . . , the nth channel obeys the Suzuki distribution.
Their respective parameters can be obtained from the orig￾inal data matrix (3.5.1).
Step 2: Establish a satellite channel multi-state Markov chain
model.
The satellite channel multi-state Markov chain model can
be denoted by the transition probability matrix P and the
state vector S, and the channel n-state Markov transferJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 168

(3.5.19)
where pij represents the transition probability from the
state i to the state j, and
n
j=1
pij = 1,(i = 1, 2,...,n) (3.5.20)
The state vector is denoted as:
S = [s1, s2,...,sn] (3.5.21)
Because this Markov chain is aperiodic and irreducible,
its steady-state distribution exists and is equal to the limit
distribution. Therefore, the state after the k transition in
the channel multi-state Markov chain model is written as:
Sk = SPk−1 (3.5.22)
where Pk−1 represents the k multiplication of the transfer
matrix P.
3.5.4 Simulation verification
In order to verify the proposed satellite channel model, simulation
verification was carried out based on the data of the Ka-band satel￾lite communication in Nanjing area [41–44]. The altitude of the
satellite was 35786 km, the transmission frequency was 30 GHz, and
the moving speed of the vehicle terminal is 36 km/h. According to
the ITU-R data and the fitting method from Equation (3.5.23) to
Equation (3.5.24), the original data of the satellite channel could beJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch03 page 169

The cumulative contribution rate (CCR) of the first three eigen￾values has reached 86.12%, which indicates that the first three
principal components basically contain the information of all the
indicators. After taking the first three eigenvalues and calculating
the corresponding eigenvectors, the first three principal components
are written as:
F1 = −0.036x1 + 0.264x2 − 0.112x3 + 0.392x4 (3.5.26)
+ 0.379x5 − 0.586x6 − 0.206x7 + 0.481x8

clustering for the satellite channel states is shown in Figure 3.56.

of the signal envelope amplitude, the envelope of the received signal
is divided into three ranges from −6 dB to −16 dB, from −16 dB to

Nonlinear Satellite Channel
Model Based on Different
Backgrounds
Summary
In this chapter, the structural characteristics of the traveling wave tube
amplifier (TWTA) model, the group delay model, and the Wiener? —
Hammerstein model are analyzed, and the nonlinear satellite channel
model and equalization system with Gaussian noise background are estab￾lished. The characteristics of alpha-stable distributed noise are analyzed,
and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model of a nonlinear satel￾lite channel is proposed by using the ability of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy
inference system to approach nonlinear function arbitrarily. By combin￾ing the TWT amplifier model with the group delay effect and using the
channel prior information, a nonlinear satellite channel model based on
channel prior information is presented.
There are all kinds of fading and distortions in satellite channels,
among which nonlinearity is a typical distortion effect. The nonlin￾earity of a satellite channel mainly comes from the nonlinearity of
the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) in the satellite and the
nonlinear effect caused by group delay fading of satellite transmission
signals.

4.1 Nonlinear Satellite Channel Model
4.1.1 TWTA model
The theoretical research and practical measurement results show that
the downlink noises of satellite communication systems are much
larger than those of the uplink. In order to combat strong noises and
other downlink channel distortions, the satellite internal transponder
must amplify the received signal [1]. The TWTA, which is generally
used as the internal high-power amplifier (HPA) of the satellite, has
the typical characteristics of a general power amplifier, that is, its
power characteristic curve includes an amplification region and a
saturation region [2]. When the TWTA is working in the amplifi￾cation region, its input and output signals have an approximately
linear relationship, that is, the TWTA linearly amplifies the power
of its input signal and its output signal does not generate nonlinear
distortion. However, satellites work in outer space, and the internal
energy is difficult to be replenished, so the internal power is very lim￾ited. In order to make full use of the limited power available in the
satellite, the TWTA generally works at or near the saturation point,
which inevitably introduces nonlinear distortions into the channel.
This nonlinear distortion is characterized by amplitude–amplitude
conversion effect (AM/AM) and amplitude–phase conversion effect
(AM/PM). Salah proposed two models to describe these two
effects: the amplitude–phase conversion model and the orthogonal
model.
In the amplitude–phase conversion model of Salah [3], the input
signal of the TWTA is written as
x(t) = r(t) cos[ω0t + ϕ(t)], (4.1.1)
where r(t) is the modulated signal envelope, ϕ(t) is the phase, ω0 is
the carrier frequency, and x(t) is the modulated signal. The output
of the corresponding amplifier is defined as
y(t) = A(r(t))r(t) cos{ω0t + ϕ(t) + φ[r(t)]}, (4.1.2)
where A(r(t)) is the AM/AM distortion and φ[r(t)] is the AM/PM
distortion. Salah proposed a two-parameter model to describeJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 181

φ[A(t)] = αφr2(t)
1 + βφr2(t)

where αa,βa, αφ, and βφ are parameters of the model. In the orthogo￾nal model of Salah, the output signal of the amplifier can be expressed
as the sum of the in-phase and quadrature components, as shown in
Figure 4.1.
In Figure 4.1, p[r(t)] is the in-phase gain component of the orthog￾onal mode and q[r(t)] is the orthogonal gain component:
y(t) = p(t) + q(t), (4.1.5)
p(t) = p[r(t)] cos[ω0t + ϕ(t)], (4.1.6)
q(t) = q[r(t)] cos[ω0t + ϕ(t)], (4.1.7)
where p(t) and q(t) are the in-phase component and orthogonal com￾ponent of the output signal, respectively. According to Equations
(4.1.2) and (4.1.5), p(t) in Equation (4.1.6) and q(t) in Equation
(4.1.7) are written as
p[r(t)] = A[r(t)] cos{φ[r(t)]}, (4.1.8)
q[a(t)] = A[a(t)] sin{φ[a(t)]}. (4.1.9)

Equations (4.1.10) and (4.1.11) are orthogonal representations of
the Salah model. Table 4.1 shows the parameters of the two Salah
models, each of which is obtained from different measured data
through several statistical experiments. In this section, the Salah
parameters are the first set of parameters for the amplitude–phase
conversion model.
4.1.2 Group delay model
The group delay is the phase rate (phase shift) of the system with
respect to frequency, which is a parameter to describe the phase
response of the system. The group delay is defined as
τ (ω) = −dθ(ω)
dω , (4.1.12)
where θ(ω) is the phase frequency response of the system. When
this parameter is constant, the delay generated by each frequency
component of the signals which pass through the system is a fixed
constant. At this time, the group delay acts as a linear filter on the
signal. If τ (ω) is a variable, the different delays corresponding to each
frequency component of the signals will be produced when it passes
through the system. Thus, the waveform of the output signals isJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 183
Nonlinear Satellite Channel Model Based on Different Backgrounds 183
inevitably distorted with respect to the input signals, and the original
signals cannot be recovered by the synchronization of the receiver.
It is pointed out in [4] that the phase frequency characteristic of the
channel was expressed as
θ(ω) = b1(ω − ω0) + b2(ω − ω0)
2 + b3(ω − ω0)
3 + b4(ω − ω0)
4 + L.
(4.1.13)
After deriving the frequency from Equation (4.1.13), the following
equation is obtained:
τ (ω) = −c1 − 2c2(ω − ω0) − 3c3(ω − ω0)
2 + L, (4.1.14)
where ω0 is the carrier frequency, −c1 is the constant term, −2c2(ω−
ω0) is the linear group delay term, and the other items “behind”
are the high-order group delay terms. The constant term represents
the linear effect of the channel, whereas the remaining terms rep￾resent the nonlinear effect. In practical systems, the linear group
delay term and quadratic nonlinear group delay term are gener￾ally studied. The object of study depends on the problem to be
studied [5].
It should be noted that in the nonlinear modeling of TWTAs, it
is usually assumed that the uplink noises are zero or additive white
Gaussian noise with a specified signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However,
the effects of the different SNRs on modeling have not been studied;
channel modeling under α-stable distributed noise has also not been
studied, and the group delay effects have not been considered, as well
as the effects of other known channel information on modeling have
not been utilized fully.
4.2 Nonlinear Satellite Channel Model and Equalization
System under Gaussian Noise Background
The nonlinear effect of HPA in a satellite causes serious distortion of
the signal, which affects the quality of communication. The key to the
research of channel distortion compensation is to use the appropri￾ate nonlinear model to approximate the nonlinearity of the channel.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 184
184 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
The traditional method uses the Volterra series to represent the non￾linearity of the satellite channel, and on this basis, the corresponding
equalization algorithm is studied.
If the Volterra series model of the nonlinear satellite channel is
adopted, the equalization model based on the Volterra series struc￾ture must be adopted in order to compensate for this effect. However,
the Volterra equalizer has numerous coefficients. If the order of the
tap coefficients is higher than three, the computational complexity
is very large and the convergence speed is slow, which is not con￾ducive to real-time processing of data. The algorithm proposed on
this basis, even if it can improve the operation speed to a certain
extent, is still subject to the slow operation speed of the Volterra
equalizer itself, and it is also limited to the study of equalization
algorithm based on the Volterra model. Researchers proposed to use
the nonlinear models of other structures to approximate the non￾linearity of the satellite channel, but only the modeling method is
given and the model parameters are obtained by system identifica￾tion, and the influence of channel noise on channel modeling is not
further considered.
In satellite communication, the channel noises are mainly atmo￾spheric noises, which are a α-stable distributed noise with very thick
trailing [6–12]. Its properties are completely different from those of
white Gaussian noise (AWGN). If the actual channel environment is
considered, the influence of uplink noises on the modeling cannot be
ignored. At present, there are no reports on the modeling methods
of the nonlinear satellite channels under the background of α-stable
distributed noise.
In this section, the nonlinear satellite channel modeling method
is discussed while considering α-stable distributed noise. First, the
Wiener model is proposed to model the nonlinear satellite channel
and the Hammerstein equalizer is used to equalize the channel. On
this basis, the performance of the Wiener model in the Gaussian
white noise environment with different SNRs is studied, and then
this modeling method is compared with predistortion and adaptive
equalization compensation method. After that, the characteristics
of α-stable distributed noise are introduced. Under the α-stable dis￾tributed noise, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS)
[13] is used to model the channel and it is compared with the Wiener
model.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 185

4.2.1.1 Wiener and Hammerstein models
The Wiener model is a commonly used nonlinear model for system
identification and system modeling. As shown in Figure 4.2, hwi is
the linear coefficient of the Wiener model and gwj is the nonlinear
coefficient of the Wiener model. In addition, the signal x(n) cannot
be measured.

4.2.1.2 Wiener–Hammerstein equalizer for nonlinear satellite
channels
The Wiener model is used to describe a nonlinear satellite channel.
The compensation device can be a Hammerstein model equalizer
or predistorter (Hammerstein–Wiener predistortion). In this section,
the two compensation devices are discussed separately and the weight
vector iteration formula (Hammerstein–Wiener predistorter) of the
Wiener–Hammerstein equalizer is derived. An equivalent baseband
model for a satellite communication system, including a channel esti￾mator and an adaptive equalizer, is shown in Figure 4.4. a(n) is the
transmitted signal from the ground, which passes through the trans￾mitting filter and the uplink, and reaches the satellite receiving end
after superimposing the uplink noise. x(n) is the output signal of the
linear filter part of the high-power amplifier, which is generally not
measurable y(n) is the output signal of the nonlinear part of HPA,
and ˆx(n) and ˆy(n) are the output signals of the linear and nonlinearJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 187

z(n) is the output signal of the adaptive equalizer based on the Ham￾merstein model. The channel estimator based on the Wiener model
is located inside the satellite and is connected parallel with the HPA.
The adaptive equalizer based on the Hammerstein model is located
after the receiving filter and before the decision device. Figure 4.4
shows that, since the HPA can be represented as a cascaded form
with a memory linear filter (FIR) and a memoryless nonlinear fil￾ter (TWTA), the nonlinearity of the satellite channel is somewhat
similar to the input–output characteristics described by the Wiener
model structure.
The equivalent baseband model for a satellite communication sys￾tem, including a channel estimator and a predistorter, is shown in
Figure 4.5. Its basic structure is the same as in Figure 4.4, except
that the compensation device is placed before the transmitting filter.
The error signal used to update the tap coefficients must be trans￾mitted to the transmitter through the receiver to update the predis￾torter coefficients. During the transmission process, a large amount
of channel noises is inevitably superimposed and the performance
of the predistorter is seriously degraded. This noise superimposed
on the error signal is not considered in [14], but the error signal
without noises is directly used to update the tap coefficient of the
predistorter. In this section, the mean square errors (MSEs) of theJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 188

predistorter and adaptive equalizer are compared without consider￾ing the superimposed noise of the error signal of the predistorter to
illustrate the superiority of the modeling-equalization method over
the predistortion method.
Here, the parameters of the Wiener model need to be estimated
for a specific actual channel. When estimating the Wiener model
parameters, the uplink channel noises are superimposed on the satel￾lite received signal, which causes the Wiener model parameter esti￾mation quality to be affected by the uplink noises, and the model
convergence speed varies with the different uplink noises. Figure 4.6
shows the relationship between MSE curves of the Wiener channel
estimator with noises under different conditions, such as 5 and 25
dB uplink noises and without considering uplink noises. As seen in
Figure 4.6, if the uplink noises are considered, the Wiener model per￾formance decreases. When the uplink noises are small, the Wiener
model can still converge with a small MSE, but the convergence speed
is slowed down. When the uplink noises are large, the channel esti￾mator has a large jitter after the convergence of the MSE curves and
the steady MSE increases. This shows that the performance of the
Wiener model is affected by the uplink noises: the greater the uplink
noises, the worse the performance of the Wiener model is. Experi￾ment results have shown that the uplink noises are almost negligible
compared to the downlink noises. Since the signal passes through the
downlink, the uplink SNR is assumed to be large.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 189

In this section, a deformation model of the TWTA model proposed
by Salah is used to describe the nonlinearity of the actual satellite
channel. The input–output relationship of the deformation model is
Sout(t) = Sin(t)A(r)ejφ(r)
, (4.2.5)
with
A(r) = αAr0
1 + βA(r0r)2 (4.2.6)
and
φ(r) = αφ(r0r)2
1 + βφ(r0r)2 , (4.2.7)
where Sout(t) and Sin(t) are the input signal and output signal,
respectively. A(r) and φ(r) denote the amplitude–amplitude con￾version effect and amplitude–phase conversion effect of the satellite
channel, respectively. r =√P(t)/P , where P(t) is the instantaneous
power of the input signals and P is the average power of the input
signals. r0 represents the amplitude fallback of the input signals.
αA = 2.1587, βA = 1.1517, αφ = 4.0033, βφ = 9.1040. The execution
steps of the entire system are as follows:
Step 1: After the transmitted signal passes through the uplink, it
reaches the satellite receiver, and after the satellite receives
the signal, it starts the channel estimator.
Step 2: Selecting the linear and nonlinear orders of the Wiener
model, and initializing the model parameters. The receiving
signal of the satellite is output by the model as ˆy(n) and
by the HPA as y(n) at the same time.
Step 3: Calculate the error denoted by e(n) = y(n) − yˆ(n), esti￾mating model parameters by stochastic gradient descent
method based on instantaneous |e(n)|

Step 4: y(n) passes the downlink to the ground receiver as the
input signal of the equalizer after passing the receiving fil￾ter again, the output signal of the equalizer is z(n), d(n) is
the desired signal of the equalizer, the χ-order delay signal
of the transmitted signal (generally 1/2 of the nonlinear
order of the equalizer) is taken. The Hammerstein model
parameters are estimated by using the stochastic gradient
descent method; among them, gH = {g1, g2, L, gK} and
hH = {h0, h1, L, hL} are the nonlinear filter and linear filter
weight vectors of the Hammerstein model equalizer, respec￾tively. The error function is denoted as e1(n) = d(n)−z(n).

If the Wiener model is fully converged, y(n) can be replaced with

y(n) ≈ yˆ(n). (4.2.17)
So, Equation (4.2.16) can be converted into

4.2.2 Simulation tests
The transmitted signal was 8PSK and its length was set to 2500. A
memoryless nonlinear model of HPA using FIR filters in series was
used. IBO (input backoff) was set to 4, the linear filter parameters
were given by [0.7962 0.1538 0.0769]. Both the linear and the non￾linear partial orders of the Wiener model were set to 3. The linear
and nonlinear partial orders of the Hammerstein model were set to
4. The delay was given by χ = 2, the step size of the equalizer was
set to μ = 0.0008.
The Wiener model was initialized to a center tap, and the weight
vectors of the linear and nonlinear parts of the equalizer were ini￾tialized to [1, 0, 0, 0]. Figure 4.7 shows the verification curves of
the Wiener model channel estimator and the actual channel out￾put obtained by the method. It can be seen from Figure 4.7 that the

channel characteristics, so it is feasible to replace y(n) with ˆy(n) in
the equalizer weight vector iteration.
Using the set of model parameters obtained by the convergence
of the Wiener model channel estimator, several experiments were
carried out, and the data with the group of data with better perfor￾mance is selected as the final model parameter. A set of parameters
from each of the 100 independent experiments was obtained, and the
final estimated parameters of the Wiener model channel are obtained
as follows:
Linear part: f lin = [1.1026 + j 0.1015, 0.2057 + j 0.0330, 0.1012 +
j 0.0160],
Nonlinear part: f non = [1.5050 − j 0.0118, 0.0010 − j 0.0004,
−0.0011 + j 0.0001].
In this way, the Wiener model modeling process of the nonlinear
satellite channel is completed. Figure 4.8 shows the MSE curves of
the predistortion and adaptive equalization, where the step sizes of
the linear and nonlinear parts of the equalizer were set to 0.0008.
It can be seen from Figure 4.8 that even if the channel noise super￾imposed on the predistorter error signal is not considered, the com￾pensation performance using the model-equalization method is still
better than the predistortion method. Therefore, in the actual chan￾nel environment, the superiority of the model-equalization method is
more obvious than the predistortion method. However, the predistor￾tion method converges faster than the model-equalization method.
Figure 4.9 shows that the signal constellation after equalization is
clear and compact, eliminating the phase rotation caused by nonlin￾ear channels.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 193

4.3 Nonlinear Satellite Channel Model and Equalization
System under Alpha-Stable Distributed Noise
Background
In existing research, the uplink noises are usually ignored or assumed
to be Gaussian white noise. This was done in order to minimize
the impact of the uplink noises on modeling to focus research on
nonlinear channel modeling. However, the atmospheric noise is usu￾ally alpha-stable distributed noise, which is completely different from
Gaussian white noise. Under alpha-stable distributed noise, the per￾formance of the Wiener model will be greatly reduced, and it is
impossible to approach the nonlinear satellite channel at all. This
section first introduces the alpha-stable distributed noise model and
describes the model parameters. Second, a simulation method gener￾ating alpha-stable distributed noise is introduced. Third, the ANFIS
is used to model the nonlinear satellite channel in the alpha-stable
distributed noise background, and the modeling results are compared
with the Wiener model.
4.3.1 Alpha-stable distribution model
The alpha-stable distribution noise is usually expressed as the fol￾lowing characteristic function [15]:
Φ(ω) = exp{jδt − γ|ω|
α[1 + jβsgn(ω) tan(πα/2)]}, α = 1
exp{jδt − γ|ω|
α[1 + jβsgn(ω)(2/π)lg|ω|]}, α = 1,

where α, β, δ, γ are constants. These parameters are defined as
follows:
(1) α is a characteristic index, and α ∈ (0, 2], which represents the
trailing thickness of the probability density function of the alpha￾stable distribution noise.
(2) β is the symmetric parameter and β ∈ [−1, 1]. If β = 0, the
alpha-stable distribution noise has symmetry and is recorded as aJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 195

SαS distribution. There is no corresponding analytical expression
for the probability density function f(x) of SαS distribution.

α). (4.3.3)
(3) δ is a positional parameter, and δ ∈ (−∞,∞]), which indicates
the median or mean of the distribution.
(4) γ is a scatter factor, which is similar to the variance of the
Gaussian distribution. It determines the deviation degree of
alpha-stable distribution from δ.
For the SαS distribution, α determines its shape. If α ∈ (1, 2],
δ denotes the mean of the SαS distribution. If α ∈ (0, 1], the mean
of the SαS distribution does not exist and δ denotes the median
of the SαS distribution. The dispersion coefficient γ determines the
deviation degree of the SαS distribution from δ.
If α = 0 and β = 0, the SαS distribution is called as the Gaussian
distribution; its characteristic function is given by
Φ(ω) = exp(jδω − γ|ω|
2). (4.3.4)
If δ = 0 and γ = 1, the alpha-stable distribution is called as the
standard alpha-stable distribution. The inverse of the Fourier trans￾form is performed on the eigenfunction shown in Equation (4.3.1),
and the probability density function of the standard alpha-stable
distribution is written as
f(x; α, β) =
⎧

(4.3.5)
It can be seen from Equation (4.3.5) that when the parameter α is
determined, the probability density function of the standard alpha￾stable distribution meets the condition f(x; α, β) = f(−x; α, −β)
and is bounded and arbitrarily derivable. However, in addition to
the Gaussian distribution, the Cauchy distribution, and Pearson dis￾tribution, probability distribution density function, and distributionJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 196

4.3.2 ANFIS model for nonlinear satellite channels
The nonlinear structure of the neural networks has a strong approx￾imation ability to nonlinear functions. The ANFIS has the ability to
approximate any nonlinear functions [16]. In this section, the ANFIS
model of the nonlinear satellite channels and updating of the ANFIS
model parameters using the backpropagation (BP) algorithm are dis￾cussed. Then, its modeling performance is compared with that of the
Wiener model. The ANFIS model combines the advantages of fuzzy
reasoning and neural networks, and uses the Takagi–Sugeno (TS)
fuzzy model for system identification. Suppose that the three inputs
of the TS model are x(n), x(n−1), x(n−2), respectively. After each
input is divided into M fuzzy sets, the first-order TS fuzzy model isJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 198

In Figure 4.10, the forward part of the model from the first layer
to the second layer can be regarded as the nonlinear processing of
the signal. The latter part of the model from the third layer to the
fourth layer are linear processes. In general, the ANFIS model is a
series model of a nonlinear and a linear structure, which is similar to
the Wiener model. The actual satellite channel can also be regarded
as a structure in which the nonlinear TWTA and linear model FIR
are connected in series. Therefore, the ANFIS model can be used to
approximate the nonlinear satellite channel.
The steps for modeling with ANFIS are as follows:
Step 1: Fuzzify the input signal, that is, the signal is input into
a system represented by a fuzzy membership function. Let
xi(n−j+1) denote the jth input signal belonging to the ith
fuzzy set. The fuzzy set to which it belongs is represented byJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 199

In parameter estimation, the antecedent parameters aij , bij , and
cij (which are membership function parameters) are regarded as

method is used to estimate them. The consequent parameters
ri1, ri2,..., (which are linear function parameters) are first fitted
by the least square method, and then the consequent parameters are
fixed, finally BP [17] and least mean square (LMS) algorithms are
used to identify the antecedent parameters aij , bij , and cij . After the
antecedent parameters and consequent parameters are obtained, the
channel modeling process is completed. The nonlinear satellite chan￾nel structure based on the ANFIS estimator is shown in Figure 4.11.

The transmitted signal was an 8PSK signal, and the high-power
amplifier adopted an FIR filter in series with a memoryless non￾linear model structure and denoted as [0.7962 0.1538 0.07697]. If the
uplink environmental noise was Gaussian white noise, the SNR was
set to 5 dB. If the uplink environmental noise was the alpha-stable
distribution noise, the SNR was set to 1 dB. The nonlinear part
includes the amplitude–amplitude conversion and amplitude–phase
conversion effects of the signal, as described in Equations (4.2.6) and
(4.2.7). They are now approximated by the Wiener model channel
estimator and the ANFIS channel estimator, respectively.
For the Wiener model channel estimator, the linear and nonlinear
partial orders of the Wiener model were set to 3, the center tap was
initialized, and the step sizes of the linear and nonlinear parts were
set to 0.01 and 0.03, respectively.
For the ANFIS model channel estimator, the delay order of the
satellite received signal is set to 3, that is, the training sequence is
given by [x(n), x(n−1), x(n−2)], the neural network is a three input–
output structure, the membership function is a bell-shaped function,
and each input signal has three membership functions. The number
of training sequence was set to 40. Figure 4.12 shows the Wiener
model channel estimator and the ANFIS model channel estimator

ANFIS, but the ANFIS model can better fit the nonlinearity of the
satellite channel from the beginning of the iteration.
Table 4.2 shows the root mean square error (RMSE) of the two
model channel estimators for different training sequence lengths.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 202

Table 4.2 Comparison of RMSEs.
Model Type Sequence Length RMSE

3500 0.2034
ANFIS model 500 0.1307
1500 0.1874
3500 0.1877
When the signal points were 1500 and 3500, the first 400 signal
points were eliminated, and the RMSE of the Wiener model was
calculated. In other words, only the performance of the convergent
Wiener model was considered. It can be seen from Table 4.2 that the
performance of the ANFIS model channel estimator is significantly
better than that of the Wiener model.
Figure 4.14 shows the validation diagram when the uplink signal
was α-stable distributed noise environment and the transmitted sig￾nal length was 2000. The linear and nonlinear partial step sizes of
the Wiener model were 0.0000000001 and 0.0000000003, respectively.
It can be seen from Figure 4.14(b) that the ANFIS model channel
estimator can fit the nonlinear channel well.
4.4 Nonlinear Satellite Channel Modeling Algorithm
Based on TWTA and Group Delay
In addition to the nonlinear effects of the TWTA, the group delay
effect of the satellite channels is also an important factor of the non￾linear distortion. The effects of the nonlinearity and group delay of
the TWTA act together on the transmitted signal, which resulting in
serious amplitude distortion and phase rotation of the received signal
at the receiver. In the satellite channel modeling, these two effects
should be considered at the same time. At present, if only one effect
is considered, the main defects of the analytical model are as follows:
the analytical model does not necessarily match the characteristics of
the channel structure. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain the channel
structure characteristics from the analytical model structure, whichJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 203

is not conducive to understanding and analysis. In addition, how to
determine the appropriate analytical model is a difficult point of the
research. In this section, the design method of the linear group delay
channel is introduced.
The combined effects of both the nonlinearity of the TWTA and
group delay are analyzed. The nonlinear satellite channel model,
based on channel prior information, is constructed and verified

4.4.1 Design of linear group delay filter
According to [5] and Equation (4.1.12), the following equation is
obtained:
ωd
ωmax
= −dθ(ω)
dω , (4.4.1)
where ωmax is the maximum frequency of the signal, ω ∈
(−ωmax, ωmax) denotes the frequency of the signal, d is the maximum
group delay distortion, and θ(ω) represents the phase–frequency
response of the signal. On integrating both sides of Equation (4.4.1)
with respect to angular frequency ω, θ(ω) is obtained as follows:
θ(ω) = − ω2d
2ωmax
+ ϕ0, (4.4.2)
where ϕ0 is the initial phase; let ϕ0 = 0.
In order to obtain the discrete impulse response h(n) of the chan￾nel, the continuous impulse response h(t) of the channel must first
be obtained, then the samples were considered. Since the phase–
frequency response of the signal is known, as long as the amplitude–
frequency response is obtained, the frequency response expression of
the system is constructed, and then inverse Fourier transform is used
to obtain the continuous impulse response of the system.
The system’s amplitude-frequency response uses a low-pass filter
with cosine step-down characteristics [18]:
H(ω)=
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
Ts 0 ≤ ω ≤ (1 − ε)π/Ts
Ts/2+(Ts/2)
sin [Ts/(2ε)] [(π/Ts) − ω] (1 − ε)π/Ts ≤ ω < (1 + ε)π/Ts
0 ω > (1 + ε)π/Ts,
(4.4.3)
where Ts is the symbol duration and ε is the step-down ratio of the
filter. The frequency response of the system is given by
H(ejω) = H(ω)e
−j ω2d
2ωmax . (4.4.4)
Inverse Fourier transform is performed on H(ω) and θ(ω) to obtain
h(t), then h(t) is sampled according to a limited time baud interval,
and finally, the discrete-channel impulse response h(n) is computed.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 205

4.4.2 Combined effects of TWTA nonlinearity
and group delay
In digital satellite communication systems, the transmitted signal is
processed by constellation mapping (i.e., modulation) as input of the
transmitting filter, and then reaches the satellite receiver through the
uplink of the satellite communication system. The internal TWTA
in the satellite amplifies the received signals and then forwards the
amplified signal. The satellite channel equivalent baseband model is
shown in Figure 4.15 [19].
In Figure 4.15, the nonlinear channel is a joint channel considering
both the nonlinearity of the TWTA and the group delay effect. It
is known from Equations (4.2.6) and (4.2.7) that the nonlinearity
of the TWTA is related to the instantaneous power of the input
signal. Group delay and signal are related to the nonlinear phase
caused by transmitter, wireless environment, high-power amplifier,
etc. These two effects do not affect each other and can be considered
independent of each other. Further analysis shows that the linear
delay of the linear part of the TWTA and the wireless environment
will cause a certain amplitude distortion of the input signal. The
amplitude of the input signal in the nonlinear part of the group delay
amplifier is different from that of the input signal without considering
the group delay. It can be seen from Figure 4.15 that the group
delay indirectly affects the amplitude conversion effect and the phase￾modulation conversion effect of the nonlinear part of the amplifier.
In order to simplify the analysis, the linear part of the trans￾mitting filter, uplink radio environment and high-power amplifier
are combined into a linear combined channel when considering the
nonlinearity of the TWTA and the group delay effect. This combined
channel is depicted in Figure 4.16.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 206

Figure 4.16 Satellite channel model considering both nonlinearity and group
delay of the TWTA.
In Figure 4.16, a(n) is the input signal of the system and b(n) is
the output of the linear combination channel when the input signal
a(n) passes through it. Group delay channel 1 represents a group
delay channel of a linear combined channel. z1(n) is the output sig￾nal of a(n) through the group delay channel 1. x(n) is recorded as
the output signal of the linear combination channel when the input
signal a(n) passes through it. The group delay channel 2 is supposed
to represent the group delay channel of the whole system, which is
the cascade of the group delay channel 1 and the nonlinear amplifier
group delay channel. However, in another branch, a(n) has been mul￾tiplied by the group delay effect of the linear combination channel
when passing through the combined channel, and if it is again mul￾tiplied by the group delay effect of the whole system, it will multiply
once more the group delay effect of the linear filter. Therefore, the
group delay channel 2 here should represent the group delay chan￾nel of the nonlinear amplifier. z2(n) denotes the output signal of the
group delay channel 2 when the input signal a(n) passes through it.
y(n) is regarded as the output signal of x(n) affected by the ampli￾tude conversion effect and the amplitude–phase conversion effect of
the TWTA, and z(n) is the output signal of the whole system.
Further analysis shows that the essence of the signal, which passes
through the linear filter, nonlinear amplifier, and group delay chan￾nel, is to cause amplitude distortion and phase rotation in the input
signal. Accordingly, the following equations are obtained:
b(n) = a(n)G1(n)ejφ1(n)
, (4.4.5)
z1(n) = a(n)G2(n)ejφ2(n)
, (4.4.6)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 207

z2(n) = a(n)g2(n)ejϕ2(n)
, (4.4.9)
z(n) = a(n)g(n)ejϕ(n)
, (4.4.10)
where G1(n), G2(n), and G(n) are the amplitude gains of the linear
combination channel, group delay channel 1, and the channel before
the TWTA, respectively. φ1(n), φ2(n), and φ(n) are the phases of the
respective channels. g1(n), g2(n), and g(n) are the nonlinear chan￾nel of the TWTA with amplitude–amplitude conversion effect and
amplitude–phase conversion effect, the group delay channel 2, and
amplitude gain of the whole system, respectively. ϕ1(n), ϕ2(n), and
ϕ(n) are the phases of the respective channels. Based on the indepen￾dence of the systems in Figure 4.16, the corresponding group delay
channels are written as
G(n) = G1(n)G2(n), (4.4.11)
φ(n) = φ1(n) + φ2(n), (4.4.12)
g(n) = g1(n)g2(n), (4.4.13)
ϕ(n) = ϕ1(n) + ϕ2(n). (4.4.14)
Combining Equations (4.4.5) and (4.4.10), we get

z(n) = y(n)z2(n)

4.4.3 Nonlinear channel model based on channel
prior information
In this section, the construction method of the satellite channel ana￾lytical model considering both the nonlinearity of the TWTA and the
group delay is discussed. Based on the Wiener model, the satellite
channel nonlinear model is introduced to make full use of the known
information of the channel to establish the channel prior information.
Finally, the proposed model is verified [20–22].June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 208

4.4.3.1 Prior information of nonlinear satellite channels
According to the analyses in the previous section, the a priori infor￾mation of the satellite channel has the following three types:
A priori information 1: The linear combined channel in Fig￾ure 4.16 can be viewed as a linear filter
with memory.
A priori information 2: The group delay channel is a nonlinear
channel.
A priori information 3: It is known from Equations (4.4.15)
and (4.4.16) that the linear combined
channel and group delay channel 1 are
regarded as two independent filters, and
the output of the system is before
the nonlinear amplifier. The product of
the output signals of the two filters is
divided by the input signal of the sys￾tem. The non-group delay channel of the
whole system and group delay channel 2
are regarded as two independent nonlin￾ear filters, and the output of the whole
system is the product of the output sig￾nal of the two filters, which is divided by
the input signal.
In addition, the following instructions are required:
(1) For a priori information 1, the transmitting filter and the wire￾less environment cause a linear filtering effect and the linear por￾tion of the TWTA causes a linear filtering effect and a memory
effect, so the entire linear combined channel can be regarded as
a linear filter with memory.
(2) Nonlinear channel includes Memoryless nonlinear channel and
memory nonlinear channel. For a priori information 2, which
kind of nonlinear group delay channel cannot be determined.
If the group delay channel is a complex nonlinear channel with
memory, the interaction between nonlinearity and memory effect
in the channel makes the channel nonlinearity more complex. In
this case, using the general nonlinear analytical model to identify
the channel may lead to divergence.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 209

4.4.3.2 Modeling process
The main differences between the modeling method given in this
section and the traditional method are as follows: the traditional
method directly uses a specific nonlinear function (analytical model)
to approximate a nonlinear channel. In this section, the existing ana￾lytical expressions of the channel structure are divided into linear
and nonlinear parts. Then, according to the a priori information of
the known channel, the corresponding linear and nonlinear parts are
used to represent the channel structure deduced from the a priori
information and combined with the known channel information to
complete the channel modeling. Finally, the new analytical model is
used to approximate the nonlinear channel until the channel model￾ing process is completed.
Taking the Wiener model as an example, the expression of the
Wiener model is written as
X(n) = 
N
i=0
WiY (n − i), (4.4.17)
Y (n) = 
M
j=1
Fj (X(n))j
, (4.4.18)
where Wi(i = 1, 2,...,N) represents the coefficients of the linear
part of the Wiener model and Fj (j = 1, 2,...,M) represents the
coefficients of the nonlinear part of the Wiener model. X(n) and
Y (n) are the outputs of the linear and nonlinear parts, respectively.
In this section, the linear and nonlinear partial expressions of the
Wiener model are used to construct the linear and nonlinear parts
of the new model.
Let the input signal of the whole system be a(n); it can be shown
from a priori information 1 and a priori information 3 that the
input signal first passes through a cascaded filter with a memory
linear combined channel and its corresponding group delay filter,
which uses the linear portion of the Wiener model to represent the
linear combined channel and the nonlinear portion to represent the
group delay filter. So, the input–output relationship is written as
x(n) = 
M1
m1= 0
c1m1 a(n − m1)
−M2
m2= 0 c2m2 [a(n)]m2
a(n) , (4.4.19)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 210
210 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
where c1m1 is the coefficient of the linear filter and m1 = 0, 1,...,M1,
c2m2 is the coefficient of the group delay filter, and m2 = 0, 1,...,M2.
According to the amplitude–amplitude conversion and amplitude–
phase conversion effects of the TWTA combined with the a priori
information 1, the following equations are obtained:
ρ(n) = |x(n)|
2, (4.4.20)
G(n) = 
M3
m3=1
c3m3 [ρ(n)]m3 , (4.4.21)
p(n) = 
M4
m4=1
c4m4 [ρ(n)]m4 , (4.4.22)
y(n) = x(n)G(n) exp[jp(n)], (4.4.23)
where G(n) and p(n) are the amplitude and phase changes of
the nonlinear amplifier, respectively. c3m3 (m3 = 0, 1, 2,...,M3)
is the weight of the amplitude–amplitude conversion effect filter.
c4m4 (m4 = 0, 1, 2,...,M4) is the weight of the amplitude–phase con￾version effect filter. c4m5 is the weight of the group delay channel 2
and m5 = 0, 1,...,M5. ρ(n) is the instantaneous power of x at time
n. From a priori information 3, the output z(n) of the entire system
is obtained by
z(n) = y(n)
M5
m5=1 c5m5 [a(n)]m5
a(n) . (4.4.24)
According to the a priori information 2, in addition to knowing
that the group delay channel is a nonlinear channel, it is impossible
to obtain more information that is helpful for the construction of the
analytical model. If the group delay channel is represented directly
by the nonlinear part of the Wiener model, it will cause a problem:
if the group delay channel is a complex memorized nonlinear chan￾nel and cannot be expressed as a cascaded structure with memory
linear structure and memoryless nonlinear structure, the nonlinear
part of the Wiener model cannot describe this nonlinearity well. If
the nonlinear model of the group delay diverges in the process of
approximating with the actual channel, the constructed entire ana￾lytical model in the process of approaching the channel may not evenJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 211
Nonlinear Satellite Channel Model Based on Different Backgrounds 211
converge. In order to solve this problem, a nonlinear soft-decision
function [22] is introduced as follows:
f(x) = 1 − e−x
1 + e−x . (4.4.25)
The function of this soft-decision function is to control the conver￾gence of its independent variable function. If the analytical expression
of the constructed group delay function can converge in the process
of approaching the real channel, its performance is maintained. If it
cannot converge, its output is limited to maintain the performance
of the entire model.
The function of the soft-decision function is now analyzed. For
Equation (4.4.25), if its independent variable x converges, i.e., x → 0,
then
lim
x→0
f(x) = limx→0
1 − exp(−x)
1 + exp(−x) = 1 − exp(0)
1 + exp(0) = 0. (4.4.26)
Equation (4.4.26) shows that, when the independent variable x of
the soft-decision function converges, the soft-decision function also
converges, that is, the soft-decision function does not improve the
performance of the original independent variable function. If the
independent variable x diverges, i.e., x → ∞, then
limx→∞ f(x) = limx→∞
1 − exp(−x)
1 + exp(−x) = 1 − exp(−∞)
1 + exp(−∞) = 1. (4.4.27)
Equation (4.4.27) shows that, when the independent variable x
of the soft-decision function diverges, the soft-decision function
approaches one. That is, when the independent variable x diverges,
the soft-decision function forces its own output to approach con￾stant 1. Thereby, the influence of the divergent independent variable
function on the whole system is eliminated. According to the analy￾sis, the soft-decision function (4.4.25) can control the convergence of
the independent function.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 212

It is obvious from Equations (4.4.19)–(4.4.27) that a nonlinear
satellite channel analytical model based on the a priori information
of the channel and both amplifier nonlinearity and group delay is
obtained. The reality of the modeling process of the system is the
process of identifying the channel using the corresponding analytical
method. The cost function of the system identification is defined as
J(n) = E{|e(n)|
2}, (4.4.30)
where e(n) = zout(n) − z(n) and zout(n) are actual outputs of the
channel. System identification is to update the weight vectors of
each part of the analytical model continuously by using the random
gradient method to make the output of the analytical model approach
the channel output as much as possible. That is, let z(n) approach
zout(n) as close as possible. The instantaneous MSE is used to replace
the statistical MSE, and the weight vector of each part of the model
is updated by the stochastic gradient method. The iterative formula
of the weight vector is given by

It can be shown from Equations (4.4.39)–(4.4.52) that the cost of
fully considering the channel prior information is the complex gra￾dient derivation process. On this basis, the whole derivation process
must be repeated again once for considering one more channel prior
information each time.
4.4.3.3 Simulation
In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the 8PSK
signal was used as the training signal of the model and the satellite
channel shown in Figure 4.15. The parameters of the linear com￾bined channel were [0.7962 0.1538 0.0769]. The nonlinear effect
of the TWTA is described by the deformation model of the Salah
model. As shown in Equations(4.2.5) and (4.2.7), αA = 2.1587, βA =
1.1517, αφ = 4.0033, βφ = 9.1040. The group delay channel param￾eters of the whole system were given by
h = [0.0091 + j0.0014 − 0.0247 + j0.0044 0.0549 − j0.0056 − 0.1246

− j0.0149 0.0549 − j0.0056 − 0.0247 + j0.0044 0.0091 + j0.0014].
The group delay channel of the whole system is a cascade of the
group delay channel 1 and group delay channel 2, i.e.,
h1 ⊗ h1 = h, (4.4.54)
where ⊗ denotes convolution. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on
both sides of Equation (4.5.54) is performed to get the followingJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 217

equation:
H1H1 = H (4.4.55)
where H1 is the Fourier transform of h1 and H is the Fourier trans￾form of h. h1 can be obtained from Equation (4.5.55) by
h1 = F−1(
√
H). (4.4.56)
The simulation results of the two models (the Wiener model and the
proposed model) were compared through the simulation experiment.
The weight order of the two models was set to 3, the center tap was
initialized to 1, the iterative step size of the linear and nonlinear tap
coefficients of the Wiener model was set to 0.0004, and the itera￾tion step size of each part of the proposed model was set to 0.001.
Figures 4.17 and 4.18 show that the MSE curves of the two models
approach those of the actual channel when the input power of the
nonlinear amplifier was backed off to 3 dB and 6 dB, respectively. In
order to better observe the convergence position of the curves, each
curve was smoothed to make the curves jitter less at the convergence
position. The input power backoff is the difference between the input
signal power and the actual input signal power when the amplifier
operates at the saturation point, which reflects the degree of the
nonlinear distortion caused by the amplitude–amplitude conversion
effect of the nonlinear amplifier and the amplitude–phase conversion
effect.
It can be seen from Figure 4.17 that when the number of iterations
was set to 0, the MSE of the proposed model was –6 dB and the MSEJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch04 page 218

of the Wiener model was 0 dB. This is because the proposed model
makes full use of the prior information of the channel. The fitting
degree of the proposed structure to the actual channel structure is
higher than that of the Wiener model. When the iteration has not
started, the proposed model has been fitted to the actual channel to
a certain extent, and the MSE is relatively small. At the beginning
of the iteration, the MSE of the proposed model is smaller than that
of the Wiener model. In the iterative process, the parameters of the
proposed model can be matched with those of the actual channel
with only minor adjustments, so the convergence speed is faster. In
Figure 4.17, the MSE curve of the proposed model was approximately
1,500 steps around the convergence. The MSE curve of the Wiener
model converged at about 4,800 steps. It can be seen from Figure 4.17
that the steady-state MSE of the proposed model is slightly lower
than that of the Wiener model.
Compared with Figure 4.17, Figure 4.18 shows that the weaker
the nonlinear effect, the closer the approximation of the two models
to the channel. In other words, the nonlinear effect has a great influ￾ence on the approximation effect of the proposed model.

Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization
Algorithm Based on Multiwavelet
Double Transform
Summary
Based on the influence of the nonlinearity of the TWTA on the modula￾tion signal, the multi-wavelet basis function is used to transform the input
signal of the equalizer and the output signal of the decision device, and a
nonlinear blind channel equalization algorithm based on the multi-wavelet
double transform is proposed. The nonlinear blind equalization algo￾rithm based on the multiwavelet neural network is studied. By combining
support vector machine, diversity technology, and neural network, the
nonlinear blind equalization algorithm based on spatial diversity support
vector machine multiwavelet neural network is studied. The nonlinear
blind equalization algorithm based on double neural networks is optimized
by chaos search algorithm. With the characteristics of feedback loop in
echo state network (ESN ) dynamic library, simplified training process,
and strong processing capacity, Volterra filter was used as the ESN out￾put layer and principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to study
the equalization algorithm based on Volterra filter ESN and PCA.
In the satellite communication system, the nonlinearity of the
satellite channel seriously affects the performance of the satellite
communication system, which can cause in-band distortion and
out-of-band spectrum regeneration, and these influences cannot be
ignored [1, 2]. Such nonlinearity mainly includes the nonlinearity of
the satellite communication system radio frequency (RF) terminal,
the satellite transponder traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA),
221June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 222
222 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
and the group delay caused by the channel distortion fading [3, 4].
Generally, the transmitter pre-distortion or receiver equalization
or higher-order multimodulus modulation can be used to reduce
the influence of the nonlinearity [5]. Although the transmitter pre￾distortion treatment can effectively improve the spectrum and power
utilization, it will result in serious distortion and affect the commu￾nication quality [6]. Although the receiver equalization technology
can effectively overcome the nonlinear influences, the weight vector
length of the equalizer affects the computation complexity. For exam￾ple, Volterra equalizer can effectively compensate the nonlinearity
of the satellite channel, but the length of the weight vector is quite
large, the computation complexity is quite high, and the convergence
speed is quite slow [7, 8]. Researches have shown that the nonlinear
channel could have been compensated by using decision feedback
equalizer without considering channel memory, but the effect was
not ideal [9]. The Hammerstein–Wiener model presented in Ref. [10]
can reduce the length of the weight vector, the computation com￾plexity, and the running time, but when the ratio of the maximum
eigenvalue to the minimum eigenvalue of the input signal autocor￾relation matrix (also known as the condition number) is larger, the
convergence speed is reduced and the tracking performance becomes
worse. Researches also show that the autocorrelation matrix of the
equalizer is more orderly and sparse after the signals are transformed
by multi-wavelet, which not only greatly reduces the computational
complexity but also improves the convergence performance [11].
In recent years, the intelligence computation, which is formed by a
combination of artificial neural network (ANN) model, fuzzy system,
genetic algorithm, evolutionary mechanism, etc., gradually becomes
an important field of artificial intelligence (AI). Among them, after
neural network has been applied in nonlinear channel blind equal￾ization, some achievements have been made [12, 13]. The support
vector machine (SVM) can minimize the actual risk by seeking the
minimization of structural risk and pursue the optimal result under
the condition of limited information. Therefore, some achievements
have been made in the research of SVM equalization technology
[14, 15]. Chaos refers to a seemingly irregular complex movement
in the real world. It is a kind of motion state exhibited by non￾linear dynamic systems under certain conditions. Chaotic searching
based on chaotic motion can effectively avoid local minimum values.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 223
Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 223
With the combination of chaos and neural network, the application
of chaotic neural network in global optimization and noise control of
nonlinear systems has become a new hotspot [16–18].
In view of the dynamic, real-time, and nonlinear characteristics
of the actual problems to be solved in the field of signal processing,
the established model should be able to perform nonlinear mapping,
access the time history and internal state of input and output sig￾nals, and also have good memory. Recurrent neural network (RNN)
is a relatively ideal model because it allows feedback connections
between different layers of neurons and have good memory. How￾ever, during the training phase, the feedback loop makes the cost
function’s derivative of the connection weight difficult to calculate,
and the instability of the network may also cause various inherent
network functions to fail. In this case, the echo state network (ESN)
originally proposed in Ref. [19] retains the processing potential of
the RNN. In the training stage, the simplified processing is realized
by setting the connection weight of the recursive inner layer (that is,
establishing the so-called dynamic library), and the desired signals
are not used; the weight vector of the output linear combinator is
adjusted by the least mean square method and the echo state net￾work is applied to the channel equalization problem [20].

communication quality, in this chapter, the following contents are

blind equalization algorithm based on multi-wavelet neural network;

5.1.1 Influence of nonlinearity of TWTA
on modulation signals
When the output vector b(n) of the transmitting filter passes through
the TWTA as shown in Figure 5.1, amplitude-to-amplitude con￾version effect (AM/AM) and amplitude-to-phase conversion effect
(AM/PM) will be generated, which will seriously affect the commu￾nication quality. According to Saleh model of the TWTA [21,22], the
input and output functions of AM/AM and AM/PM are given as
follows:
A(r) = αar/(1 + βar2) (5.1.1)
Φ(r) = αpr2/(1 + βpr2) (5.1.2)
where αa = 2, βa = 1, αp = π/3, βp = 1. The characteristic curves
of the TWTA are shown in Figure 5.2.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 225

Figure 5.2 Characteristic curves of AM/AM and AM/PM functions.
It has been seen from Figure 5.2 that after the signal passes
through the TWTA, the amplitude and phase produce significant dis￾tortion. In satellite communications, the quadrature phase shift key￾ing (QPSK) signals perform better in terms of bandwidth and power
tradeoffs than binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and 16QAM signals.
Although BPSK and QPSK have the same bit error rate (BER), the
energy efficiency of the latter is only half that of the former. Although
16QAM can improve the spectrum utilization, the TWTA must have
high transmission power under the same BER as other modula￾tion methods [23]. In satellite communication, frequency resources
are relatively abundant and transmission bandwidth is wide, but
the communication distance is long, transmission loss is large, and
power resources are limited. Therefore, satellite communication gen￾erally adopts a modulation mode with high power utilization rate.
At present, most communication satellites and TV relay satellites
use QPSK modulation to transmit service data. APSK signal, as
a method combining orthogonal amplitude modulation with phase
shift keying (PSK) modulation, has relatively few signal modulus
values and small fluctuations of the signal envelope, which not only
reduces the nonlinear sensitivity to the TWTA but also improves the
spectrum utilization, and is an appropriate modulation method in
satellite communication. In order to analyze the effect of the TWTA
on APSK signal, 16QAM and 16PSK signals were compared andJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 226

effect of the TWTA on APSK signals, as shown in Figure 5.3.
Figure 5.3 shows that after 16APSK passes the TWTA, the BER
is the minimum. In other words, the nonlinearity of the TWTA has
the largest effect on 16APSK distortion.
5.1.2 Blind equalization algorithm based
on nonlinear filter
This section introduces two basic nonlinear filters: decision feedback
filter and Volterra filter.
5.1.2.1 Decision feedback filter
Decision feedback equalization (DFE) consists of a feedback loop
and is a nonlinear structure, whose feedforward filter, like the linear
equalizer, takes the output y(n) of the channel as its input and whose
feedback filter takes the decision signal ˆa(n) of the equalizer as its
input [24]. The output of the feedback is used to offset the partial
distortion caused by the feedforward filter.
Suppose that the length of the feedforward filter of the equal￾izer is Nf , that of the feedback filter is Nb, and the weight vec￾tors of the feedforward part and the feedback part are f (k) and
b(k), respectively, then the decision input of the feedback equalizer isJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 227

5.1.2.2 Volterra filter
Volterra series is a kind of functional series [25]. As a memory exten￾sion of Taylor series, Volterra series is widely used in the analysis of
nonlinear systems and has strong system representation ability. The

the system, h1 represents the linear response, and the second-order
and higher-order kernel represent the nonlinear response.
The equalizer with the transverse filter structure is essentially a
finite impulse response filter, and the Volterra series has numerous
items, so it is necessary to intercept the Volterra series according
to the actual requirements of the system. Based on Equation (5.1.4),
the output of the n-order Volterra nonlinear equalizer can be
expressed as:
z(n) =
N

m3=0
f(m1, m2, m3)y(n − m1)y(n − m2)
× y∗(n − m3) (5.1.5)
where f(m1) and f(m1, m2, m3) are the weights of the equalizer and
N is the memory length of the filter. In satellite communication,
nonlinear channel is a bandpass filter, and the frequency component
generated by the even-order term is far away from the carrier fre￾quency and is filtered by bandpass filter, so only the odd-order term
is considered. In Equation (5.1.5), the first term is a linear term,
which is used to achieve linear equalization of the satellite channel,
and the third term is nonlinear and is used to realize the nonlinear
equalization of the satellite channel. According to Equation (5.1.5),
the weight vector length of the n-order Volterra nonlinear equalizer
is computed by:
L =
(N

+1)/2
n=1
N2n−1 (5.1.6)
For convenience, the input y(n) of the equalizer or the output of
the receiving filter and the weight coefficient of the Volterra equalizer
may be expressed in matrix form.
Let the weight vector of the Volterra equalizer be written as:
f (n)=[f(n), f(n − 1),...,f(n − L + 1)]T (5.1.7)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 229
Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 229
The input to the equalizer is denoted as:
y(n)=[y(n), y(n − 1),...,y(n − L + 1), y2(n)y∗(n),...,
y2(n − L + 1)y∗(n − L + 1)]T (5.1.8)
At this point, the output to the equalizer is written as:
z(n) = f T(n)y(n) (5.1.9)
5.1.3 Volterra blind equalization algorithm
In Figure 5.1, the weight vector of the Volterra equalizer may be
updated according to constant modulus blind equalization algorithm
(CMA). In the CMA, its error function is defined as:
e(n) = R2 − |z(n)|
2 (5.1.10)
where R2 is the modulus value of the CMA and
R2 = E{|a(n)|
4}
E{|a(n)|
2} (5.1.11)
The cost function of the CMA is defined as:
J[e(n)] = E{e2(n)} (5.1.12)
Then, the weight vector of the equalizer is updated as follows:
f (n + 1) = f (n) − μ∇ˆ fJ[e(n)] (5.1.13)
where μ is the step-size, and the choice of step-size μ is very impor￾tant. The larger μ is, the quicker the convergence rate is, but the
bigger the steady-state MSE is. The smaller μ is, the smaller the
steady-state MSE is, but the slower the convergence rate is.
∇ˆ fJ[e(n)] means the instantaneous value of the partial derivative
of J[e(n)] to f (n). The gradient vector should be found by minimizingJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 230
230 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
the cost function, namely,
∇ˆ fJ[e(n)] = ∂
∂f (n)
{e2(n)} = 2e(n)
∂e(n)
∂f (n) (5.1.14)
While
∂e(n)
∂f (n) = ∂[z(n)z∗(n)]
∂f (n) = ∂[f T(n)y(n)(yT(n)f (n))∗]
∂f (n)
= 2y∗(n)yT(n)f (n)=2y(n)z∗(n) (5.1.15)
Therefore, the iterative equation of the weight vector of the Volterra
equalizer is written as:
f (n + 1) = f (n) − 4μe(n)z∗(n)y(n) (5.1.16)
The Volterra equalizer gives consideration to both linear and non￾linear structure of the system and is suitable for various nonlinear
system models. However, it has a large number of weight coefficients,
and the computational complexity increases rapidly with the increase
of memory depth. On the other hand, the dimension of the input vec￾tor to the nonlinear equalizer is much larger than that of the linear
equalizer, which will increase the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue to
the minimum eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix of the input
vector to result in a rather slow convergence rate. In view of the
nonlinear characteristics of the satellite channel and the defects of
the Volterra equalizer, this section is intended to improve on the
following aspects:
(1) The Volterra equalizer will be replaced with the Wiener equalizer
to reduce the complexity of the equalizer structure.
(2) The input vector of the Wiener equalizer is transformed by the
balanced orthogonal multiwavelet basis function to reduce the
autocorrelation of the input signals.
(3) A first-order decision feedback filter is added to the output end
of the Wiener equalizer, and the inputs of the decision feedback
filter are used as the decision output of the Wiener equalizer.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 231

5.1.4 Nonlinear blind equalization algorithm
based on balanced orthogonal multiwavelet
double transform
Aiming at the defects of the Volterra equalizer of the nonlinear satel￾lite channel, part 2 in Figure 5.1 is modified into Figure 5.5 according
to the improvement discussed in the previous section [26].
In Figure 5.5, the balanced multiwavelet converter (BMC) and
Wiener blind equalization algorithm constitute the balanced multi￾wavelet transform Wiener blind equalization algorithm. The BMC
and decision feedback filter (DFF) constitute the balanced multi￾wavelet transform feedback filter. This blind equalization algorithm
with double balanced multiwavelet transform is called as the blind
equalization algorithm based on balanced orthogonal multiwavelet
double transform.
5.1.4.1 Multiwavelet representation of the equalizer
Multiwavelets are composed of multiple scale functions, which are
supported on any scale without heavy barriers. The correlation
among different frequencies in multiwavelets is smaller, and the
decorrelation is better. The ratio of the maximum and minimum
eigenvalues of the autocorrelation matrix after multiwavelet trans￾form is smaller. At the same time, it has orthogonality, symmetry,June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 232
232 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
and short support. Therefore, the performance of the equalizer con￾structed by multiwavelet is better than that constructed by single
wavelet [26, 27].
In Figure 5.5, the impulse response f1(n) of the linear module of
the Wiener equalizer is a finite number of values and is denoted by
multiwavelet as:
f1i(n) = r

(5.1.17)
When the multiwavelet function and scale function are deter￾mined, the characteristics of the equalizer are determined by wj,k,l(n)
and vJ,k,l(n) and then the weight coefficients of the equalizer consist
of wj,k,l(n) and vJ,k,l(n). The output of the equalizer is expressed as:

where ψj,k,l(n) represents the ith wavelet basis function with scale
parameter j and translation parameter k, ϕJ,k,l(n) represents the
lth scale function with scale parameter J and translation param￾eter k. Equation (5.1.8) shows that the discrete orthogonal multi￾wavelet transform of the input y(n) is equivalent to the convolution
of the input y(n) with the multiwavelet basis function on each scale.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 233
Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 233
From Equation (5.1.17) to Equation (5.1.19), the essence of using
multiwavelet to represent equalizer is to carry out balanced orthogo￾nal multiwavelet transform on the input signal of the equalizer, but in
practical application, a prefiltering process must be carried out first,
and the prefiltering process will destroy the symmetry and orthogo￾nality of the multiwavelet. In order to avoid these problems, Lebrun,
Vetterli, et al. proposed the balanced orthogonal multiwavelet the￾ory, and its basic idea is to make the known unbalanced multiwavelet
rotate at a certain equilibrium degree to turn it into the balanced
multiwavelet. In general, the orthogonal unitary matrix is used for
the first- or multi-order balance processing of the orthogonal mul￾tiwavelet, but the first-order balance processing is helpful in reduc￾ing the computational complexity. Therefore, the orthogonal unitary
matrix selected for first-order equilibrium processing is defined as:
U = 1

The balanced multi-low pass filter and multi-high pass filter are
denoted as, respectively,


H˜ (ω) = U T H (ω)U
G˜ (ω) = G(ω)U (5.1.21)
where H(ω), G(ω) are multi-low pass filter and multi-high pass filter
before balancing, respectively.
Based on the Mallat algorithm, the input vector y(n) of the equal￾izer is decomposed into a balanced multiwavelet. In order to decom￾pose the input vector y(n)=[y(n), y(n − 1),...,y(n − m + 1)]T of
the equalizer, it is necessary to define block matrices Pj and Qj ,
where Pj and Qj are composed of the coefficients of the new multi￾low-pass filter H˜ (ω) and multi-high-pass filter G˜ (ω) after balancing,
respectively, and they are written as:

where j = 1 ∼ J,l = m/2j−1, J, l ∈ Z, so the Mallat decomposition
equation is written as:
v J = PJPJ−1 ··· P1y, wJ = QJPJ−1 ··· P1y (5.1.23)
The Mallat decomposition structure is shown in Figure 5.6.
In Figure 5.6, vj and wj are the low-pass coefficients and high￾pass coefficients of the input y(n) after the j-level decomposition,
respectively, and the signal vector after decomposition of balanced
orthogonal multi-wavelet is given by:

equalization algorithm
In Figure 5.5, the input vector of the linear module of the Wiener
equalizer is denoted as u as shown in Equation (5.1.26), so the output
of the linear module of the Wiener equalizer is given as follows:
u2(n) = f10(n)u(n) + f11(n)u(n − 1) + ··· + f1M−1(n)u(n − M + 1)

where u = [u(n), u(n − 1),...,u(n − M + 1)]T, and
f 1(n)=[f10(n), f11(n),...,f1M−1(n)]T.
The output of the nonlinear module of the Wiener equalizer is
given as follows:

From Equation (5.1.24)–(5.1.32), a Wiener blind equalization
algorithm based on balanced orthogonal multiwavelet transform is
proposed. In this proposed algorithm, the balanced orthogonal mul￾tiwavelet transform is put before the Wiener equalizer, and the input
signal is transformed by orthogonal multiwavelet transform to reduceJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 237

the signal autocorrelation so as to achieve the purpose of accelerating
convergence.
5.1.4.3 Balanced orthogonal multiwavelet double transform
decision feedback filter
According to the idea of [28] and Figure 5.5, after the input of the
decision feedback filter (DFF) fB(n), namely, the decision output
aˆ(n) of the Wiener equalizer, is transformed by balanced orthogonal
multiwavelet, its input vector is written as:
y B(n) = V MWTaˆ(n) (5.1.33)
At this point, the input of the decision device is given by:
g(n) = z(n) − zB(n) = z(n) − fB(n)y B(n) (5.1.34)
where zB(n) is the output of the DFF fB(n) and
zB(n) = fB(n)y B(n) (5.1.35)
Since the input of the DFF is transformed by the balanced orthog￾onal multiwavelets, the DFF is called as the balanced orthogonal
multiwavelet DFF. The weight vector of the balanced orthogonal
multiwavelet DFF is updated as follows:

After the inputs of the feedback filter and the Wiener equalizer are
transformed by the balanced orthogonal multiwavelets, the structure
of the Wiener equalizer and the feedback filter is improved, and the
weight vectors of the improved Wiener equalizer and the improved
feedback filter are still updated by CMA. This improved algorithm
is called as double multi-wavelet transform-based nonlinear constant
modulus blind equalization algorithm and decision feedback equalizer
(DMWT-NCMA-DFE).
5.1.4.4 Computational complexity
The computational complexity of the Volterra blind equalization
algorithm and the DMWT-NCMA-DFE in this section are analyzed.
Since the amount of multiplication is much larger than that of addi￾tion, the frequency of multiplication required by the DMWT-NCMA￾DFE algorithm to run once is taken as the measure of the amount
of calculation.
According to Equation (5.1.5), there are a large number of multi￾plication operations in the third-order nonlinear term of the Volterra
equalizer, and 3N3 + N multiplication operations are required
when the signal passes through the equalizer. According to Equa￾tion (5.1.16), N3 + N + 1 multiplication operations are required
for each update of the weight vector, so the multiplication time
required for the weight vector update of the Volterra equalizer is
4N3 + 2N + 1 for each time. Assume that the length of input real
signal is H , the orthogonal multiwavelet transform of the input sig￾nal y(n) (note that V MWT is H × H orthogonal matrix) according
to Equation (5.1.26) needs to multiply H 2 times since the DMWT￾NCMA-DFE needs to run H point balanced orthogonal multiwavelet
transform in each weight vector iteration. Consider that the actual
signal length is very long and the filter length is very short, that
is, V MWT is a sparse matrix. Assume that the number of non-zero
elements in each row of V MWT is M1(M1  H), the multiplication
time of Equation (5.1.22) is M1H, when the signal passes through the
Wiener equalizer, and the multiplication time of Equations (5.1.27)
and (5.1.28) is (1+2+···+N +M1). The computation loads brought
by Equations (5.1.31) and (5.1.32) are (1 + 2 + ··· + N + M1). After
the decision feedback module is calculated from Equation (5.1.33)
to Equation (5.1.37), the required computation load is M1H + 7M1,June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 239
Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 239
and the required multiplication time of the DMWT-NCMA-DFE is
N2+N + 2M1H + 7M1. Obviously, it is lower than the Volterra blind
equalizer.
5.1.5 Algorithm simulation
To verify the performance of the DMWT-NCMA-DFE, the Volterra
blind equalization algorithm, nonlinear constant modulus blind
equalization algorithm and decision feedback equalizer (NCMA￾DFE), multi-wavelet transform-based nonlinear constant modulus
blind equalization algorithm and decision feedback equalizer (MWT￾NCMA-DFE) were compared. In the simulations, the memory length
of the Volterra series model was set to 3, the parameters M1 = 16
and M2 = 3 of the linear and nonlinear modules of the Wiener
equalizer, and the initialization weight vector f 1(0) = [1, 0,..., 0]T
and f 2(0) = [1, 0,..., 0]T. The weight length of the feedback fil￾ter was set to MB = 5, and the weight vector was initialized to
fB(0) = [0, 0,..., 0]T. The outer and inner radius ratio of the APSK
constellation was set to 2.73. Both the transmitting filter and the
receiving filter adopted the square root ascending cosine filter, whose
roll down factor was 0.35 and sampling rate was 8. The SNR was 20,
J = 2, and the average power was initialized to 25. The results with
200 Monte Carlo simulations are shown in Figure 5.7.
In Figure 5.7(a), it has been seen that the convergence speed of
the DMWT-NCMA-DFE has an improvement of about 4000 steps
in comparison with that of the MWT-NCMA-DFE, and the con￾vergence speed of the Volterra blind equalization algorithm and the
NCMA-DFE is very low and shows almost no convergence. In 2000
iterations, the MSE of the DMWT-NCMA-DFE (converged) has a
drop of about 3 dB in comparison with that of the MWT-NCMA￾DFE, while the NCMA-DFE (unconverged) has a drop of about 5 dB
in comparison with that of the Volterra equalization algorithm. It has
been seen from Figure 5.7(c) to Figure 5.7(f) that serious distortion
occurs when 16APSK signals pass through the nonlinear satellite
channel (as shown in Figure 5.7(b)), and that when the DMWT￾NCMA-DFE, the MWT-NCMA-DFE, the MWT-NVMA-DFE and
the Volterra blind equalization algorithms are used to restore the
signal constellation, the output constellation of the DMWT-NCMA￾DFE is the clearest, most concentrated, and compact.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 240

In order to test the recovery ability of the DMWT-NCMA￾DFE, 16QAM, 16PSK, and 16APSK signals were selected as the
input of the nonlinear satellite channel. The simulation parame￾ters are the same as before and the simulation results are shown in
Figure 5.8.
It has been seen from Figure 5.8 that for 16QAM signal, the
convergence rate of the DMWT-NCMA-DFE is extremely slow, and
it has not yet converged after 10,000 iterations, and for 16PSK signal,
the MSE of the DMWT-NCMA-DFE after convergence has a drop of
about 3 dB in comparison with that of 16APSK, but the convergence
speed has a drop of about 500–1000 steps in comparison with that
of 16APSK.

5.2.1.2 Neural network model
Neural network is a directed graph composed of interconnected
synaptic nodes and activated connections. Among them, the con￾struction of neuron is closely related to the learning algorithm of
the training network. From the connection mode, the neural network
is mainly divided into the feedforward neural network and feedback
neural network, which are described as follows:
(1) Feedforward neural network, as shown in Figure 5.10.
In a feedforward neural network, the output of the neurons in
the previous layer serves as the input of the neurons in the next
layer, and the input and output layers are connected with the
outside world. As a hidden layer, other middle layers, called as
hidden layers, exist between external input and network output
in some way. Adding one or more hidden layers can improve
network performance.

the input of the neuron is affected by the output of the neuron.
5.2.2 Nonlinear blind equalization algorithm based
on multiwavelet neural network
The feedforward neural network (FNN), structurally speaking, is
hierarchical, and the signal from the input layer to its next layer
and any unit of each layer has a connection, and also its traditional
training method is the back propagation (BP) algorithm. In terms
of system theory, the feedforward neural network is a steady-state
nonlinear system with good nonlinear classification function.
5.2.2.1 Neural network blind equalization system model
The principle of neural network blind equalization algorithm is shown
in Figure 5.12. a(n) is the transmitted signal vector, x(n) is the out￾put vector to the channel, w(n) represents additive Gaussian white
noise vector, y(n) denotes the input vector to the equalizer, z(n) rep￾resents the output to the equalizer, and ˆa(n) represents the output
of the decision device.
Cybenc has proved that the neural network structure can approx￾imate a continuous function with arbitrary accuracy. In this sec￾tion, the three-layer feedforward neural network structure is shown
in Figure 5.13.
In Figure 5.13, fij (n) is the connection weight coefficient between
the ith neuron in the input layer and the jth neuron in the hidden

5.2.2.2 Nonlinear blind equalization algorithm based
on multiwavelet neural network
The idea of introducing balanced orthogonal multiwavelet transform
into the neural network nonlinear blind equalization algorithm is to
carry out orthogonal multiwavelet transform on the input signal of
the neural network equalizer at the same decomposition scale and
adjust the weight vector from the input layer to the hidden layer of
the neural network with the signals transformed by the multiwavelet.
At this point, the principle of the multiwavelet transform feedback
neural network nonlinear blind equalization algorithm (MWT-FNN)
[29] is as shown in Figure 5.14.

In Figure 5.14, the input R(n) of the neural network equalizer
can be obtained after the channel output signal y(n) passes through
the multiwavelet transform, namely,
R(n) = V MWTy(n) (5.2.10)
where V MWT represents the matrix of the balanced orthogonal mul￾tiwavelet transform. According to Equation (5.2.10), the input and
output of the hidden layer are written as:

(MWT-FNN).

y(n) is transformed by orthogonal wavelet in the process of updatingJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 249
Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 249
the weight vector. Compared with the conventional FNN algorithm,
the computational load increases to some extent. Now, multiplica￾tions are taken as the measure of computation complexity. Let the
length of input signal be N and the weight length of the neural
network equalizer of the input layer be L, then the multiplications
of Equation (5.2.10) are LN, and the multiplications from Equa￾tion (5.2.11) to Equation (5.2.14) are (2I + 2J)N, and the multipli￾cations required to update the weight vector of the input layer are
8N. Similarly, the multiplications required to update the weight vec￾tor between the hidden layer and the output layer are 6N, then the
multiplications of the MWT-FNN are (14 + 2I + 2J + L)N.
5.2.3 Algorithm simulation
In order to verify the performance of the nonlinear blind equalization
algorithm based on multi-wavelet neural network, the input signal
was selected as 2PAM, the weight vector length of the neural network
equalizer was set to 16, the fourth tap was initialized to 1, the step￾size was given by μ = 1 × 10−5, and the SNR was set to 20 dB.
The weight vector length from the input layer to the hidden layer
of the multi-wavelet neural network was set to 16, DB2 wavelet was
selected, and the step-size was given by μ = 8 × 10−4. The input–
output relationship based on the nonlinear Wiener channel model is
shown in Figure 5.15.
In Figure 5.15, H = [0.3122−0.1040 0.8908 0.3134] represents the
linear part of the nonlinear channel. In the nonlinear part, D = 0.1
is the quadratic coefficient and D1 = 0.05 is the cubic coefficient.
Simulation results with 500 Monte Carlo simulations are shown in
Figure 5.16.
Figure 5.16(a) shows that the convergence speed of the MWT￾N-FNN algorithm based on the multi-wavelet neural network has
an improvement of about 2000 steps and the steady-state MSE is
reduced by 6 dB in comparison with those of the N-FNN algorithm.

The constellations of the output signals are clearer and more com￾pact. This may be due to the good decorrelation of the orthogonal
multiwavelets, the nonlinearity of the neural networks, and the abil￾ity to process signals in a large parallel distribution.
5.3 Nonlinear Blind Equalization Algorithm Based
on Support Vector Machine and Neural Network

Support vector machine (SVM) [30] is developed from the optimal
classification surface in the case of linear separability, and its idea is
shown in Figure 5.17.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 251

In Figure 5.17, black and white dots represent two different types
of data samples, H1 and H2 which refer to the line nearest and paral￾lel to the classification line and pass through various data samples as
much as possible. The distance Δ between them is called as the clas￾sification interval (margin). The optimal classification line not only
requires that the classification line can separate the two kinds of data
sets but also that it can maximize the classification distance between
them. Among them, the former ensures the empirical risk minimum,
whereas the latter ensures the minimum confidence range of general￾ization, i.e., the real risk minimum. If two-dimensional classification
is extended to multi-dimensional space, the optimal classification sur￾face can be obtained.
5.3.1.1 Optimal classification surface
Let the linear separable sample set be (xi, yi), and i = 1,...,n,
xi ∈ Rd and yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the category symbol. The general
linear discriminant function is given by f(x) = ω · x + b, and the
corresponding classification surface equation is:
ω · x + b = 0 (5.3.1)
To normalize the discriminant function, it is required that all
samples can be classified correctly and |f(x)| ≥ 1 must be satisfied.
At this point, the sample closest to the classification surface meets
the conditions as follows:
yi[(ω · x) + b] − 1 ≥ 0, i = 1, 2,...,n (5.3.2)
At this point, the maximization of the classification interval
2/||ω|| is equivalent to the minimum of the classification intervalJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 252

||ω||2. The optimal classification surface H in Figure 5.17 is the clas￾sification surface which satisfies Equation (5.4.2) and makes 1

the minimum. The data samples on hyperplanes H1 and H2 parallel
to classification plane H are those data samples that make the equal
sign hold in Equation (5.4.2). These data samples are support vectors
(SV) that support the whole optimal classification surface.
Therefore, the optimal classification surface problem can be
transformed into the constrained optimization problem of Equa￾tion (5.4.2), namely, to find the minimum value of the function
J(ω), i.e.,
J(ω) = 1
2
||ω||2 (5.3.3)
This constrained optimization problem is called as the original
problem, which has two characteristics: (1) cost function J(ω) is
convex function of ω; (2) the constraint is linear with respect to ω.
Now, the Lagrange multiplier method is used to solve the constrained
optimal problem. The Lagrange function is defined as:
L(ω, b, a) = 1
2
||ω||2 −n
i=1
αi[yi(ω · xi + b) − 1] (5.3.4)
where αi ≥ 0 is the multiplier of Lagrange. In order to find the min￾imum value of Equation (5.3.4), let the partial differential of Equa￾tion (5.4.4) with respect to ω, b and αi, respectively, be zero i.e.,

(5.3.5), the problem of solving the optimal classification surface can
be transformed into a dual problem of finding the optimal solutionJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 253

The above is the general expression of support vector machine.
5.3.1.2 Generalized optimal classification surface
The above method is feasible only on the premise of ensuring that all
training samples are correctly classified, and the best generalization
performance can be obtained by maximizing the classification inter￾val. When the optimal classification surface cannot correctly separate
the two kinds of data points, in order to achieve a balance between
empirical risk and generalization performance, it can be considered
to introduce the relaxation factor ξ and acquiesce to the existence
of misclassification samples. At this point, the classification surface
ω · x + b = 0 satisfies the following condition:
yi[(ω · xi) + b] ≥ 1 − ξi, i = 1, 2,...,n (5.3.9)
When 0 < ξi < 1, the sample point xi is classified correctly. When
ξi ≥ 1, the sample point xi is wrongly classified. If the penalty termJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 254

effective tool to solve this problem by kernel transformation.

Kernel function is one of the key techniques of support vector
machine (SVM). Kernel function transformation is a very convenient
way, which uses kernel function transformation Φ to map the random
vector x from the n-dimensional vector space to the high-dimensional
vector space, and turns the nonlinear inseparable into linear separa￾ble, and designs the learning algorithm in the high-dimensional vector
space. The principle is shown in Figure 5.18.
There are three common kernel functions of support vector
machines: polynomial function, radial basis function, and sigmoid
function. These are described as follows:
5.3.1.3.1 q-order polynomial function
The kernel function is selected as:
K(x, xi) = [(x, xi) + 1]q (5.3.12)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 255

Then, the discriminant function of the SVM is defined as:
f(x, α) = sgn 
s
i=1
αiyi[(xi · x) + 1]q − b

(5.3.13)
where s is the number of support vectors. The order q of polynomial
can control the VC dimension of the system.
5.3.1.3.2 Radial basis function
The kernel function is chosen as:
K(x, xi) = exp 
−|x − xi|
2
σ2

(5.3.14)
Then, the discriminant function of the SVM is written as:
f(x) = sgn 

NC
i=1
αi exp 
−|x − xi|
2
σ2

− b

(5.3.15)
In Equation (5.4.15), the center position of the radial basis func￾tion is determined by the support vector xi, and NC is the number
of centers. Assume that the data sample is hypersphere distribution
in the input space, the value of the scale parameter σ is the radius
of the hypersphere.
5.3.1.3.3 Sigmoid function
The sigmoid kernel function is as follows:
K(x, xi) = tan h[υ(x · xi) + a] (5.3.16)
In Equation (5.3.16), sigmoid is a hyperbolic tangent function. If and
only if the values of υ and a meet the Mercer condition, the possibleJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 256
256 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
cases are υ = 2 and a = 1. At this point, the discriminant function
of the SVM is given as follows:
f(x) = sgn 
s
i=1
αi tan h[υ(x · xi) + a] + b

(5.3.17)
Equation (5.3.17) is the discriminant function of the three-layer
neural network model, whose hidden layer node corresponds to the
support vector.
5.3.2 Regression principle of support vector machine
The regression problem is to set up a new sample of the input data
x and infer the corresponding output value yi (which can be any
real number) according to the given sample data. Set the given data
sample set as {(xi, yi),...,(xl, yl)}, xi ∈ Rn, i = 1, 2, 3,...,l and
yi ∈ R, the regression problem is to find a function y = f(x) on Rn,
and infer the corresponding y value from any input x, as shown in
Figure 5.19.
In Figure 5.19, “×” represents the sample points in the set of
the data samples, and the curve represents the regression objective
function f(x).
When the SVM is applied to the regression problem, the main
features of the maximum interval algorithm can be retained and the
nonlinear function can be obtained from the linear learning machine
in the kernel feature space.

5.3.2.1 Linear support vector machine regression
Let’s say there is an n-dimensional sample vector, and the data sam￾ples in the space are (x1, y1),(x2, y2),...,(xl, yl) ∈ Rn × R. Let the
linear function be defined as:
f(x) = ω · x + b (5.3.18)
This optimization problem is expressed as:
R(ω, ξ, ξ∗) = 1
2
ω · ω + C

l
i=1
(ξ + ξ∗) (5.3.19)
where 1
2ω · ω can make the function more flat and improve the gen￾eralization ability. In order to make the regression problem more
precise, the “softening method” is introduced here. Assume that C
is the penalty parameter and ξ and ξ∗ represent the relaxation vari￾ables, then the constraint condition is written as:
f(xi) − yi ≤ ξ∗
i + ε (5.3.20)
f(xi) − yi ≤ ξi + ε (5.3.21)
where ξ∗
i , ξi ≥ 0, i = 1,...,l , ε is a normal number.
After the Lagrange function is introduced, the convex quadratic
optimization problem required to be solved is represented as:

The maximum value is obtained by partial derivative of Equa￾tion (5.3.22) with respect to αi, α∗

in high-dimensional characteristic space by nonlinear mapping.
The key to solve the regression problem is the choice of kernel
function K(x, y). Here, the optimization problem is to maximize
the optimization function under the constraint of Equation (5.3.29),

According to the Kuhn–Tucker theorem, one has

Equations (5.3.26), (5.3.29), (5.3.35), and (5.3.36), one gets

5.3.3.1 SVM multi-wavelet neural network blind
equalization algorithm
In view of the lack of global searching ability of the multi-wavelet neu￾ral network nonlinear blind equalization algorithm, in this section,
the SVM is used to search the optimal initial connection weight vec￾tor between the input layer and the hidden layer of the multi-wavelet
neural network, so as to obtain the principle of the SVM multi￾wavelet transform feedback neural network nonlinear blind equal￾ization algorithm (SVM-MWT-FNN) [29], as shown in Figure 5.20.

input vector of the neural network equalizer transformed by multi￾wavelet, z(n) is called as the output of the neural network equalizer,
and ˆa(n) is the decision output of a(n).
When the transmitted signal vector a(n) is a constant modulus
vector, the top N-group vectors of the y(n), which are received by
the equalizer, can be equalized by the SVM. According to the sta￾tistical characteristics of the transmitted signals and the principle of
the structural risk minimization, the initial connection weight vector
f ij (n) between the input layer and the hidden layer of the MWT￾FNN is estimated with precision ε, then the SVM regression problem
can be described as [30–34]:
min Esvm(f ij (n)) = 1
2
||f ij (n)||2 (5.3.39)
The constraint conditions are written as follows:


R2 − ([f ij (n)]Ty(n))2 ≤ ε
([f ij (n)]Ty(n))2 − R ≤ ε

where σ2

In order to relax constraints, relaxation variables ξ(n) and ˜ξ(n)
and penalty coefficient C are introduced, and the optimization prob￾lem of Equations (5.3.39) and (5.3.40) can be transformed into the
problem of solving constraint optimization, that is,

(5.3.43)
In Equations (5.3.42) and (5.3.43), ξ(n) and ˜ξ(n) are used to measure
the distance of sample outliers, and the penalty variable C reflectsJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 262

where gn = |y(n)|
2, E[gn] denotes the mean of gn, and σε represents
the variance of the received signals.
In the above original optimization problem of constructing the
SVM multi-wavelet neural network nonlinear blind equalization algo￾rithm, the weight vector f ij of the equalizer in the constraint con￾dition is quadratic, and the linear programming algorithm adopted
by SVM cannot solve the quadratic original optimization problem.
Therefore, an iterative weight quadratic programming algorithm is
used to solve this problem. Suppose that the input of the hidden layer
of the neural network is uJ
j,SVM(n), and after obtaining uJ
j,svm(n), the
quadratic constraint in Equation (5.3.43) can be changed to the lin￾ear constraint, namely,

5.3.3.2 Nonlinear blind equalization algorithm based on spatial
diversity SVM and multiwavelet neural network
The basic principle of the diversity technology is to combine multiple
statistical independent fading channels with unified information to
reduce the influence of the fading. It is widely used in mobile com￾munication because it can effectively improve the reliability of com￾munication via tracking each path signal and processing more signal
components in time. According to different diversity resources, the
diversity technology can be divided into time diversity, space diver￾sity, and angle diversity. In this section, the spatial diversity [35, 36],
also known as antenna diversity, will be selected, which uses multiple
transmitting or receiving antennas. In order to obtain a satisfactory
diversity effect, the distance between antennas at the receiving endJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 264

d ≥ 3λ and λ is the wavelength of working frequency. Usually, the
more diversity antennas there are, the more obvious the fading elim￾ination effect will be. However, when the diversity multiplicity is
increased to a certain amount, the improvement of the diversity per￾formance is obviously weakened. Therefore, it is advisable to have a
diversity multiplicity belonging to the range from 2 to 4. Since the
fading of signals in diversity branches is independent of each other
and the probability of the simultaneous fading is very low, the appli￾cation of spatial diversity to blind equalization system can effectively
eliminate channel fading and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Monsen
was the first to combine spatial diversity equalizer (SDE) with blind
equalizer. The spatial diversity requires at least two antennas at a
certain interval, and the diversity structure is shown in Figure 5.21.
When the spatial diversity technique is applied to the SVM multi￾wavelet neural network nonlinear blind equalization algorithm, each
branch of the diversity contains a SVM multiwavelet neural network
blind equalizer [37–40], and the outputs of all branches are weighted
and combined. The spatial diversity blind equalizer based on the
SVM multi-wavelet transform feedback neural network (SDE-SVM￾MWT-FNN) is proposed, as shown in Figure 5.22.
According to the principle of the wavelet neural network equalizer
optimized by support vector machine, the input and output signals
of the dth branch equalizer are written as follows:

5.3.3.3 Computational complexity
Since there are the SVM, D − 1 branches, and a weighted combi￾nator in the structure of the blind equalization algorithm, the com￾putational complexity of this blind equalization algorithm will be
increased to some extent. According to literature [30], let n be the
number of training samples. For a test sample, the computational
complexity of the SVM is O(n3), while the computational complexity
of the MWT-FNN is O(MN), then it can been known from Equa￾tion (5.3.51) to Equation (5.3.56) that the computational complexity
of the SDE-SVM-MWT-FNN is O(Dn3 + DMN + D) ≈ O(Dn3).
Obviously, it is the same order of magnitude as the complexity of the
SVM.

4 = 0.0012.
For channel 2, the step-size was set to μ(2)
4 = 0.0003. DB2 multi￾wavelet was used, the training sample number of the SVM blind
equalization algorithm was set to N = 100, λ = 0.9, and the switch￾ing threshold was η = 10−4. The results of 500 Monte Carlo simula￾tions are shown in Figure 5.23.
It can be seen from Figure 5.23(a) that the SDE-SVM-MWT-FNN
has an improvement of about 1500 steps, 2500 steps, and 7500 steps
in comparison with that of the SVM-MWT-FNN, the SVM-FNN,
and the FNN. In terms of steady-state MSE, the SDE-SVM-MWT￾FNN has a drop of about 5 dB, 8 Db, and 13 dB IN comparison with
that of the SVM-MWT-FNN, the SVM-MWT-FNN, the SVM-FNN,
and the FNN. It can be seen from Figure 5.23(b) to Figure 5.23(f)
that the constellations of the SDE-SVM-MWT-FNN are clearer and
more compact than those of the SVM-MWT-FNN, the SVM- FNN,
and the FNN, and the ISI is significantly reduced.
5.4 Blind Equalization Algorithm Based
on Chaos Algorithm
Chaos is a kind of complex motion form which seems irregular in
the real world, and it is a kind of motion state of nonlinear dynamic
system under certain conditions. Chaos has its own characteristics
that are as follows: randomness, ergodicity, and regularity. When
the space is stable, the chaotic motion track can traverse every stateJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 268

point in the space, without repetition and disorder. This feature can
avoid local minimum effectively in the process of chaos searching.
5.4.1 Basis of the chaos algorithm
5.4.1.1 Chaos theory
Chaotic signals have the following characteristics:
5.4.1.1.1 Sensitive dependency of initial value
The initial value sensitive dependence of chaos is also known as the
butterfly effect. If the initial value is slightly different, the subsequent
system will have great change. Therefore, the long-term moving tra￾jectory of the chaos system is unpredictable. The characteristics can
be explained by logistic mapping of the chaotic system. The logistic
mapping system can be expressed as:
x(n + 1) = μx(n)(1 − x(n)), x(n) ∈ [0, 1], μ ∈ [0, 4] (5.4.1)
When the parameter μ ∈ [3.7, 4], the mapping is chaotic, as shown
in Figure 5.24.
5.4.1.1.2 Elongation and folding characteristic
Chaos has the characteristics of elongation and folding. When the
system is unstable, the distance between the points will be enlarged,
which is called as the elongation characteristic. But the whole systemJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 270
270 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
is stable and the stable system will limit the distance between points,
which is called as folding property. Chaos is produced by the repeated
stretching and folding of the system.
5.4.1.1.3 Fractal and self-similarity
All kinds of strange attractors in chaos have a fractal structure, which
is described by fractal dimension. At the same time, fractal in chaos
has self-similarity, which can be strict or traditional. Fractal and
chaos are different manifestations of the same law. They are fractal
in space and chaotic in time.
5.4.1.1.4 Boundedness and inner randomness
Chaos has inherent randomness, which comes from the sensitive
dependence of the system on the initial value. The system does not
need any additional random factors and is completely described by
deterministic equations, but it will behave like randomness. The tra￾jectories shown in Figure 5.24 remain within [0,1], so the chaotic
system is stable and bounded on the whole.
5.4.1.2 Chaos algorithm
The chaos algorithm [36, 37] based on the carrier transformation
method takes the chaos variable as the carrier, whereas chaos variable
is mapped to the optimization variable region by linear mapping. In
the chaos algorithm, the searching optimization variable is replaced
with the updated chaos sequence, the chaos variable is used to tra￾verse all the states in the space one by one during searching, and all
the experienced states will not be searched repeatedly, which greatly
saves the search time.
Logistic model is a special case of the chaos dynamic model. Its
dynamic characteristic equation is simple and mature, so it is often
used in the chaos optimization method. After using the model to
generate chaotic variables x(n), the chaotic variable y(n) may be
expressed as:
y(n) = a + x(n) × (b − a) (5.4.2)
where b and a are the upper and lower limits of the value range of the
optimized variable y(n). During the whole optimization process, x(n)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 271
Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 271
keeps searching for the updated value in (0,1), and y(n) is mapped
by x(n) and simultaneously traverses the entire optimization variable
space with x(n). After n times of the traversal optimization, the
optimal solution of the problem can always be found.
5.4.2 Chaotic optimization process
Compared with other optimization algorithms, in terms of cost func￾tion, the chaos optimization algorithm does not need many restric￾tions. It only needs to repeatedly calculate the value of the cost
function and then compare and update, which simplifies the inter￾mediate operation and improves the efficiency. Moreover, according
to the ergodicity of chaotic searching, the searching process avoids
falling into the local optimal solution problem. In this section, the
chaos optimization method in literature [41–44] is adopted. At the
current point of the disturbance weight vector of the chaos vari￾able, the time-varying parameter is introduced, so that the ampli￾tude of the disturbance changes at any time, and the update of
the parameter are gradually reduced. Accordingly, the problem
of the initial value sensitivity of the classical chaos algorithm is
solved. After getting the optimal solution, the local fine search is
carried out, so as to obtain the required global optimal weight
vector.
In the chaotic optimization process, similar carriers are intro￾duced into the chaotic variable to search, the time-varying param￾eter Ψ(t) is brought in the second carrier process, and f(K) =
fopt + Ψ(t)(C(K) − 0.5) is introduced into the optimization vari￾able. Among them, f(K) is the optimization variable, K and t are
the iteration times, fopt represents the current optimal variable,
C (K) = {C1(K), C2(K),...,Cn(K)} represents the chaotic vari￾able vector generated by chaotic mapping, n is the dimension of the
optimization variable, and Ci(K) denotes the ith dimension value
of C(K). Let the iteration equation of the time-varying parameters
be Ψ(t + 1) = λΨ(t), λ is the attenuation factor of the time-varying
parameters, and λ ∈ [0.95, 0.999]. The initial value of Ψ(t) is denoted
as Ψ(0) = (Jopt −Jmax)/ ln P, where Jopt and Jmax are the minimum
and maximum values corresponding to the cost function among all
feasible solutions obtained in the first-stage chaotic searching, and
the selection range of parameter P is (0, 1).June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 272
272 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
In this section, the minimum value Jopt of the cost function
obtained by chaos optimization is used as the optimization weight
coefficient of the input layer of the neural network. When chaotic
variables are generated, the mapping formula of the chaotic signals
generated by logistic mapping is written as:
C(K + 1) = ρC(K)[1 − C(K)] (5.4.3)
where ρ ∈ [3.57, 4].
Let the cost function be Jopt = J(f opt) = Jmin(f ), J and f ∈ [d, e]
represent the cost function and the optimization vector. Suppose that
the number of the first-stage iterations of chaos algorithm is N1 and
the number of the second-stage iterations is N2, then the steps of the
weight vector of the input layer for the chaotic optimization neural
network equalizer are as follows:
Step 1: In the interval [0,1], n different values are taken as the initial
values C (where 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 could not be taken)
and then let the optimal solution be fopt corresponding to
Jopt and the maximum value of the cost function be Jmax.
Assume K = 0 and t = 0.
Step 2: n chaotic variables are obtained through iteration of Equa￾tion (5.4.3) and each variable has a different trajectory. The
following equation is used to change the value range of opti￾mization variables.
f(K) = s + rC(K) (5.4.4)
where s = d and r = e − d.
Step 3: After the chaotic variable is updated, J(f (K)) is computed
and the value of Jmax and Jopt is saved.
If J(f (K)) ≤ Jopt, Jopt = J(f (K)) and f opt = f (K). If
J(f (K)) > Jmax, Jmax = J(f (K)), K = K + 1. If K ≤ N1,
then iteration goes back to Step 2.
Step 4: After Jopt is obtained in Step 3 and the parameter P is
selected, the initial value Ψ(0) of the time-varying parame￾ter is calculated by Ψ(0) = (Jopt−Jmax)/ ln P. After search￾ing in Step 3, the second carrier is calculated by:
f(K
) = fopt + Ψ(t)(C(K
) − 0.5) (5.4.5)
where Ψ(t + 1) = λΨ(t) and t = t + 1.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 273
Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 273
Step 5: Chaos optimization variables are searched after the second
carrier is obtained and J(f(K
)) is calculated.
If J(f (K
)) ≤ Jopt, Jopt = J(f (K
)) and fopt = f (K
),
Otherwise, f (K
) is given up, and K = K + 1.
Step 6: If K > N2, searching is stopped and output Jopt and its cor￾responding global optimal solution fopt are obtained. Oth￾erwise, the searching returns to Step 5.
To sum up, Steps 1–6 are the optimization process of the
chaos algorithm. In this section, the chaos optimization
algorithm is used to optimize the weight vector between
the input layer and the hidden layer of the neural net￾work. The final output fopt is the initialization value of the
weight vector between the input layer and the hidden layer
of the multiwavelet neural network. The process is shown
in Figure 5.25.
5.4.3 Multiwavelet double neural network nonlinear
blind equalization algorithm based on
chaos optimization
Although the neural network blind equalization algorithm is simple
in structure, its nonlinear processing ability is not strong. In this sec￾tion, the blind equalization algorithm based on double neural network
is proposed.
The earliest feedback neural network was put forward by the
physics professor Hopfield in 1982. He introduced the concept of
“energy function” in the neural network, gave the criterion of network
stability, and opened up a new field of the neural network in signal
processing. Aiming at the nonlinear channel equalization problem,
the neural network is combined with the decision feedback neural
network to form the double neural network blind equalization algo￾rithm, as shown in Figure 5.26.
It can be shown from Figure 5.26 that both the prefilter and
the feedback filter of the double neural network blind equalization
algorithm are a neural network filter. The nonlinear processing ability
of the blind equalization algorithm is enhanced by introducing the
decision feedback structure and the increase of neurons. fij (n) is

5.4.4 Computational complexity
After introducing the chaos optimization algorithm and the dual neu￾ral network structure, the computational complexity will increase to
some extent.
Let the length of the input signal be N, the length of the first
carrier searching be N1, that of the secondary carrier searching be N2,
and that of the input layer weight vector of the neural network be L.
The complexity of generating mapping signal from Equation (5.4.3) is
calculated as L2+3L. Based on the steps of optimizing the input layer
weight vector of the neural network according to the chaos algorithm,
its computational load is obtained by L2+3L+3N2
1 +6N1+3N2
2 +6N2.
According to the fact that the prefilter and the feedback filter are
both neural network filters and the Equations (5.4.6)–(5.4.15), the
computational complexity of the network filter is equal to 2MN. So,
the computational complexity of the CO-MWT-D-ANN is calculated
by L2 + 3L + 3N2
1 + 6N1 + 3N2
2 + 6N2 + 2MN.
5.4.5 Algorithm simulation
In order to verify the effectiveness of the CO-MWT-D-ANN algo￾rithm, the FNN, the MWT-FNN, and the CO-MWT-FNN were com￾pared. The channel model is shown in Figure 5.15. The input was
2PAM signal, the SNR was set to 25 dB, the sampling point was set
to 10000, and the length of the weight vector was 16. In the FNN,
the step-size was given by μ = 0.00001, and the fourth tap was ini￾tialized to 1. In the MWT-FNN, the step-size was set to μ = 0.0008,
DB2 multi-wavelet was selected, and the fourth tap was initialized
to 1. In the CO-MWT-FNN, μ = 0.00002, the DB2 multi-wavelet
was also used, and the fourth tap was initialized to 1. In the CO￾MWT-D-ANN, μ = μb = 0.00001, and the fourth tap was initialized
to 1500 Monte Carlo simulation results as shown in Figure 5.28.
Figure 5.28(a) shows that the convergence speed of the CO-MWT￾D-ANN is faster by about 500 steps, 7500 steps, and 9000 steps than
that of the CO-MWT-FNN, the MWT-FNN, and the FNN. The con￾vergence speed of the CO-MWT-FNN has an improvement of about
7000 steps and 8500 steps in comparison with the MWT-FNN and the
FNN. As far as the steady-state MSE is considered, the CO-MWT￾D-ANN has a drop of about 13 dB and 6 dB in comparison with the
FNN and the CO-MWT-FNN, whereas the CO-MWT-FNN has aJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 278

from Figure 5.28(a) to Figure 5.28(f) that the output constellations
of the CO-MWT-FNN are clearer and more compact than those of
the FNN and the MWT-FNN. The output constellations of the CO￾MWT-D-ANN are the clearest and most compact, and the recovery
of the signals is more accurate.
5.5 Equalization Algorithm Based on Volterra Filtering
Echo State Network and PCA
A key research topic in the field of intelligent signal processing is
the study of effective solutions based on dynamic and real-time sys￾tems. Due to the increasing complexity of the most relevant practical
problems, the development and application of models endowed with
feedback loops are virtually a constant demand. Furthermore, it is
essential that the proposed models be capable of performing non￾linear mappings and also access the time history of the input and
output signals as well as the internal states.
In this context, the recurrent neural network (RNN) allows the
feedback connection between different layers of neurons, has good
memory, and can be realized by backpropagation through time
(BPTT) [45] and real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) [46]. However,
all these approaches are associated with well-known drawbacks. For
instance, during the training phase, it is difficult to compute the
derivatives of the cost function with respect to the parameters. Fur￾thermore, the instability of the network may make it difficult for the
network structure function to be effectively played. In these scenar￾ios, the echo state network (ESN), originally proposed by Jaeger [47],
represents a robust and promising solution, as they preserve, in a
measure, the processing potential of the RNN structure and intro￾duce a significant simplification into the network training process.
This is cleverly accomplished by setting the connection weights of the
recurrent internal layer, also called the dynamical reservoir, without
employing information about the desired signal. Thus, the remaining
task is to adapt the weights of the output linear combiner, which can
be performed by means of any method that solves a least squares
problem.
It is important to stress that the idea of creating the reservoir
of dynamics without resorting to an error signal implies a certainJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 280
280 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
reduction in the representation capability of the network, especially
if compared with an ideally adjusted similar structure. Therefore,
selecting an adequate choice of the reservoir weights is a vital element
to the design of the ESN. This observation was the main concern of
the work by Ozturk et al. [48]. Employing an information-theoretic
measure, Ozturk et al. analyzed the correlation between the echo
states and then proposed a method for selecting the values of the
reservoir weights which favors the occurrence of a higher degree of
diversity when compared to the original proposal of Jaeger [47]. Nev￾ertheless, both ESNs cannot make a full effective use of the higher￾order statistics of the signals coming from the reservoir, since the
output layer still corresponds to a linear combiner, for the sake of
keeping the training process as simple as possible. Thus, in order
to overcome this limitation, moving toward the use of a nonlinear
output layer may be an interesting perspective.
In this work, a novel ESN architecture was proposed [49], whose
linear combiner is replaced with the structure of a Volterra filter [50],
which not only contributes to the better exploitation of the infor￾mation associated with the internal signals but also preserves the
simplicity of the training process, since the problem of adjusting the
output weights remains linear with respect to the free parameters.
Additionally, aiming to prevent the curse of dimensionality [51], i.e.,
the occurrence of an excessive growth in the number of weights to be
adapted as the number of echo states increases, the principal compo￾nent of the echo state is extracted by principal component analysis
(PCA) [52, 53] to reduce the number of echo states and adjust the
length of the weight vector. Since the echo state network can achieve
the inherent trade-off between processing power and computational
complexity [54, 55], applying an echo state network to the channel
equalization problem is a promising and effective solution for both
real-time and non-real-time.

specifies the coefficients of such combinations.
The inner layer, also known as the dynamic reservoir, con￾sists of fully connected nonlinear units whose activation, given by
x(n)=[x1(n),...,xK(n)]T , corresponds to the network state and
are updated as:
x(n + 1) = f (Winu(n + 1) + Wx(n) + Wbacky(n)) (5.5.1)
where W ∈ RN×N brings the weights of the connections within the

connections that project the output samples back to the internal
units, and f (·)=(f1(·), f2(·),...,fN (·)) represents the activation
function of the inner layer unit.
The output vector y(n)=[y1(n), y2(n),...,yL(n)]T of the net￾work is determined by the following expression:
y(n + 1) = f out(Woutx(n + 1)) (5.5.2)
where Wout ∈ RL×N represents the output weight matrix and
f out(·) = {f out
1 (·), f out
2 (·),...,f out
L (·)} represents the activation func￾tion of the inner unit.
In 2001, Jaeger studied the dynamics of the RNN structure shown
in Figure 5.29. Studies have shown that under certain circumstances,
the network state x(n) becomes asymptotically independent of the
initial conditions. In other words, if the network starts from twoJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 282
282 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
different initial states x(0) and xˆ(0), and the same sequence of
input signals is received, then the obtained sequences of states x(n)
and xˆ(n) converge close to the values. When this property holds,
the effects of the initial state vanish, and the reservoir dynamics
depends solely on the input history, so that the network has echo
states [47].
In addition, Jaeger demonstrated two sufficient conditions with
respect to the echo state: (1) in order to represent the echo state
attribute with an RNN, the maximum singular value of the internal
weight matrix W must be less than the unit value (σmax(W) < 1)
[47,56]; (2) according to the internal weight, the spectral radius of the
internal weight matrix W (for the maximum value of the absolute
value of the eigenvalue) gives the condition for establishing a network
without an echo state and if ||W|| > 1, then the network has no echo
states.
Based on these observations, Jaeger proposed an adaptive process
that simplifies the RNN: first, construct a weight matrix W satisfy￾ing ||W|| < 1; next, arbitrarily define the input weight matrix Win,
since it does not harm the echo state property; finally, by employing a
linear combiner as the output layer, the adaptive problem of remain￾ing weights is converted into the problem of minimizing the MSE.
Therefore, any linear regression algorithm can be used to perform
such tasks, which constitutes the essence of the ESNs [47].
ESNs are a promising and interesting alternative to the tradi￾tional RNNs as they are capable of bringing together the ability of
accessing the time history of the input and output signals — which
they inherit from the RNNs — and a simple training procedure,
since the connection weights within the reservoir are predefined. The
strategy of maintaining such weights fixed is what provides agility to
the training algorithm, in contrast to the standard approach for the
adaptation of recurrent neural networks, which involves adjusting the
whole set of weights [57–59].
It should be noted that the dynamical reservoir is completely spec￾ified by the weight matrix W, and it should be as rich as possible in
order to allow an adequate approximation of the desired signal. How￾ever, in accordance with the spirit of the echo state approach, the
reservoir is designed without access to information regarding the par￾ticularities of the application, which, in a certain sense, characterizesJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 283

a reduction in the representation capability of the network when com￾pared to a similar structure with an adjustable weight matrix W.
Recently, Ozturk et al. used average state entropy (ASE) as a mea￾sure of the richness of the dynamic reservoirs [48]. In addition, they
observed that the diversity of the echo states reflects the eigenvalue
structure of W to some extent. This study led to the proposal of
a different method for designing the reservoir, that is, in order to
maximize the ASE, the poles of the linearized system derived from
the ESN dynamics should be uniformly distributed — given a chosen
radius — within the unit circle, which evokes the conceptual frame￾work of Kautz filters. Henceforth, this latter network shall be referred
to with the acronym ASE-ESN, whereas ESN will correspond to the
original network conceived by Jaeger.
5.5.2 Average state entropy: echo state network
The ESN can be explained in terms of a trade-off between perfor￾mance and simplicity. On the one hand, the learning method in the
ESN cannot achieve all the potential from the underlying processing
structure, since the recurrent connections within the dynamic reser￾voir cannot be adaptively adjusted by means of an error signal. On
the other hand, the ESN does not adopt an adaptive method, which
avoids the inherent difficulties of the classical RNN learning algo￾rithm, which is a significant feature. The core of this trade-off lies
in the design of the echo state dynamic reservoir. Since no informa￾tion regarding an error signal is available, the idea is to produce the
highest possible diversity of dynamics, in order to better supply with
relevant information the output layer, which is then adapted with the
aid of a reference signal. However, in the existent proposals of echo
state networks, the output layer corresponds to a linear combiner,
which cannot exploit the higher-order statistics of the information
coming from the nonlinear dynamics of the neurons of the reservoir.
To avoid this problem, a nonlinear output layer is used here. How￾ever, in order to maintain the inherent simplicity of the ESN, it is
crucial that the output layer remains linear with respect to the free
parameters. After all, in this case, it is possible to find a closed￾form solution in the least squares (or Wiener) sense [54]. Taking into
account these facts, the proposal in this section is to use a VolterraJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 284
284 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
filter structure for the output layer [49]. Thus, the network outputs
shall be composed of linear combinations of polynomial terms, as
follows:
yi(n) = h0 +
N
i=1
h1(i)xi(n)+
N
i=1

N
j=1
h2(i, j)xi(n)xj (n)

i=1

N
j=1

N
k=1
h3(i, j, k)xi(n)xj (n)xk(n) + ··· (5.5.3)
where xk(n) indicates the kth echo state at the time n and yi(n)
is the output of the ith network. Obviously, the coefficient hi(·) is
linearly related to the output.
However, the Volterra architecture introduces a new concern, that
is, as the number of echo states (N) increases, the number of kernels
tends to increase dramatically. In fact, it is obvious that if the expres￾sion of the number of non-fuzzy kernels Nker is observed.
Nker =1+ N +
N(N + 1)
2 +
N(N + 1)(N + 2)
6 + ··· (5.5.4)
As we can see, depending on the maximum order of the kernels
we intend to use, the respective number of coefficients that must be
adjusted tends to be severely increased, which threatens the practical
application of this structure along with the ESN.
To alleviate this problem, principal component analysis (PCA) is
used to reduce the number of effective signals transmitted to the out￾put layer. The principal components are extracted from the active
state of the output layer by the PCA. Thus, instead of transmitting
the whole set of echo states, only a relatively small number of princi￾pal components are used, which reduces the quantity of weights that
need to be adjusted without necessarily causing a significant loss of
information.

where V ∈ CN×Npc is a matrix composed of eigenvectors correspond￾ing to the Npc maximum eigenvalues of Cˆ . Therefore, the principal
components are given by [53]:
si = V T
i RTs (5.5.6)
where i = 1 , 2,...,Npc.
Since there is a non-negligible redundancy among echo states, the
PCA can be used to analyze this redundancy. In fact, there was a
strong correlation among the echo states [48], which means that it
is possible to preserve a few principal components of the echo state
x(n). In addition, the PCA can be used to reduce the computational
complexity of subsequent operations and the effects of noise.
To summarize, the PCA and Volterra filters are employed in order
to achieve compression and a reduction of the number of coefficients
to be adapted and also to obtain a more effective exploitation of the
information regarding the echo states.
5.5.3 Principle of channel equalization
The purpose of channel equalization is to minimize the distortion
of the signals as it travels through the channel to the receiver. The
channel can be thought of as a filter, its input is the transmitted
signal a(n), and its output signal is r(n), as shown in Figure 5.30.
In Figure 5.30, the channel can be either linear or nonlinear, with
varying degrees of randomness, and the channel characteristics deter￾mine the degree of distortion in which the signal is transmitted. An
effective method to reduce the distortion is to use a specially tailored
filter or equalizer at the receiver, whose response function is opposed
to the channel. Ideally, its output should be the delayed signals of
the transmitted signals, i.e.,
z(n) = ka(n − d) (5.5.7)

286 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
where z(n) is the output of the equalizer, k is a proportional constant,
and d denotes the equalization delay. This equalizer must be forced
to zero [54].
The design contexts of the equalizer includes as follows: (1) design
a suitable filtering structure; (2) define an effective equalization crite￾rion; (3) give an effective optimization method to adjust the param￾eters of the filter.
The first choice is crucial. Its design has a direct impact on the
equalization performance. The linearity or nonlinearity of the chan￾nel determines the memory effect of the channel, which is an inher￾ently random factor. The effects of these factors must be handled by
the filtering structure. In some cases, linear channels can be com￾pensated by linear equalizers, and the equalizer with the nonlinear
structures can solve some linear problems [55]. Whether it is a linear
or nonlinear channel, its memory has a deep influence on the required
memory of the equalizer, both for linear and nonlinear models, and
in this context the use of recurrent structures arises in a natural way.
Finally, the structure of the existing channel noise may require the
use of a nonlinear structure – as a consequence, for example, of a
pronounced non-Gaussian character or even of a recurrent structure
if temporal dependence is a key factor [60].
The second choice amounts essentially to a translation of the aim
of the equalization task — with Equation (5.5.7) — into mathe￾matical terms. A classical choice has been to use a MSE criterion,
also known as Wiener criterion, which leads to the following cost
function:
JMSE = E{[a(n − d) − z(n)]2} (5.5.8)
where E{·} indicates statistical expectation operator. Under the
MSE criterion, if the filter structure is feedforward and linear with
respect to its free parameters, then the cost function has a single
extreme point, and the Wiener solution based on this cost function
can be obtained by direct least squares or iterative LMS and RLS
algorithm [54]. On the other hand, if the filter structure is nonlinear
or recursive with respect to the free parameters and/or recurrent,
the cost function can have multiple local extremum points, that is,
the cost function has diversity, which establishes a more complicated
search problem.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 287
Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 287
From the previous analysis, the most ideal equalizer should have a
nonlinear recursive structure, because it can meet both memory and
mapping in the most general way. From an optimization standpoint,
it is difficult to find the optimal MSE solution due to the diversity
of the cost functions.
5.5.4 Algorithm simulation
Now consider the training and testing methods of the channel
equalization algorithm based on the echo state network and the
performance of the proposed algorithm in different scenarios. All
experiments were carried out in the MATLAB platform.
5.5.4.1 Method
In all simulations, the source signal a(n) is selected as an equal prob￾ability (BPSK modulation) value {+1, −1}. The purpose of each echo
state network is to estimate the original signal r(n) using the received
signal a(n) at the same time instant, meaning that there is no equal￾ization delay and that the number of inputs and outputs was always
equal to one (K = L = 1). Furthermore, in noisy scenarios, the influ￾ence of the SNR over the performance of the ESNs is analyzed.
If the presence of noise is not considered, it means that the input
u(n) of the ESNs is exactly equal to r(n).
Each network was trained using Ts = 1100 samples of the
input signal, being the first hundred discarded to eliminate transient
effects. The same approach was employed during the testing phase.
The MSE was defined as:
MSE = 1
Ts

Ts
n=1
[d(n) − zESN(n)]2 (5.5.9)
where d(n) denotes the desired signal and zESN(n) denotes the net￾work output.
In order to continuously evaluate the performance of the net￾works, an average MSE (AMSE) for 20 independent runs is regarded
as the MSE standard deviation, which reflects the equalization per￾formance of each channel obtained by the echo state networks. The
performance of each echo state network is observed under differentJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 288
288 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
numbers of internal neurons. Based on the preliminary simulation,
the number of internal units remains equal to N = 40 in all experi￾ments, whereas the number of principal components varies.
Based on the procedure described in [47], the ESN was con￾structed as follows: the input weight coefficients were set to −1 or
+1 with equal probability, and the elements of the reservoir weight
matrix W were set to −0.4, 0.4, and 0, respectively, and their cor￾responding probabilities were 0.025, 0.025 and 0.95.
For both the ASE-ESN and the proposed network, the adjust￾ment of Win was similar to the procedure in the ESN. In terms of
the reservoir weight matrix W, the method proposed in [56] was
employed for the ASE-ESN [48], using a spectral radius equal to 0.8.
Since the proposed network can be easily adapted to different tech￾niques for the reservoir design, its performance was analyzed using
the methods offered by [47, 48]. These versions shall be identified as
proposed ESN and proposed ASE-ESN, respectively. For the sake of
brevity, the presentation of the results for the approach which led to
the best performance was restricted. Finally, Wback was set to zero
for all networks, as performed in [47, 48].
For all networks, a desired signal d(n) was given, and the output
weight matrix Wout was resolved by Wiener method. It is important
to emphasize that the output weight coefficients are related to the
signals, that is, in the ESN and the ASE-ESN, the echo state x(n) is
linearly combined to generate the output. On the other hand, in the
proposed network, the PCA and the Volterra filters were used as the
basic framework of the output layer. In this case, the output weight
coefficients correspond to the coefficients used in the combination of
the kernel functions. Another relevant aspect is that in the proposed
network, the output was calculated using a third-order Volterra filter,
and for the sake of simplicity, the quadratic term was not considered.
5.5.4.2 First channel
The transfer function of the first channel is given by:
H(z)=0.5 + z−1 (5.5.10)
This seems to be a relatively simple channel, but when the equal￾ization delay is zero, the linear filter cannot be used for equalization,June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch05 page 289
Nonlinear Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 289
since in this case, the corresponding channel states cannot be sepa￾rated linearly. Table 5.1 gives the performance comparison results for
the different network structures. The values presented inside paren￾theses in Table 5.1 correspond to the standard deviation.
Some interesting remarks can be drawn from Table 5.1. Firstly,
when the number of neurons inside the reservoir or the number of
principal components increases, the AMSE value decreases and the
performance of the ESNs is improved. Secondly, by comparing the
AMSE values obtained by the ASE-ESN and the proposed ASE-ESN
method, the network performance is significantly improved by using
the nonlinear output layer. The benefits acquired with the use of a
nonlinear output become evident. In fact, in the ASE-ESN, N = 60
and in the proposed ASE-ESN, Npc = 6, the number of output weight
coefficients to be adjusted in the both networks is roughly equal (60
and 62 weights, respectively), and in this case, the proposed network
leads to a significantly better performance. Thirdly, the AMSE values
of the ESN and the ASE-ESN are different, which indicates that the
dynamic reservoir weight matrix designed using Jaeger’s scheme will

achieve a better performance. This observation is corroborated when
comparing the AMSE values associated with each version of the pro￾posed network. As shown in Table 5.1, the proposed model achieved
a better performance when the reservoir was designed as in the ESN,
reaching smaller AMSE values than its counterpart, which, again,
indicates the potential of the proposed architecture. One last perti￾nent comment is related to the variability of the MSE values obtained
with each network, that is, it is possible to infer from Table 5.1, with
the aid of the standard deviation values, that the proposed model,
even in the worst case, offers a significant improvement in the per￾formance, for both training and test sequences, when compared with
the ESN and the ASE-ESN.
5.5.4.3 Second channel
In 1999, Montalv˜ao et al. [61] demonstrated that feedforward struc￾tures, either linear or nonlinear, are not suitable tools for the equal￾ization of communication channels that present coincident states, i.e.,
whose transfer function presents zeros over the unit circle. Therefore,
this class of channels demands the use of feedback connections in the
equalizer in order to allow a correct separation of the states. For
example, for the channel of the transfer function H(z) = 1+ z−1,
the value r(n) = 0 generated by the input sequence of symbols
(a(n) = −1, a(n − 1) = 1) and (a(n)=1, a(n − 1) = −1).
Table 5.2 displays the AMSE values obtained for each echo state
network.

Table 5.2 confirms that recurrent connections within the reser￾voir enable the ESN to preserve the memory of the past received sig￾nals, which is decisive to a full recovery of the original information.
This means that the fixed dynamic library weights can simplify the
training process of the recurrent network and still provide sufficient
processing capability for the network. Table 5.2 also shows that the
proposed network does not have any improvement in the AMSE and
may be related to the essence of this equalization problem, which may
be more dependent on the existence of feedback connections rather
than on the intrinsic difficulty of the required mapping. However, it
is important to emphasize that the proposed network performance is
quite satisfactory.
5.5.4.4 Third channel
The transfer function of the channel is defined as H(z)=0.5 +
0.71z−1 + 0.5z−2. According to Proakis [62], this is a linear channel
with three coefficients that introduces the most severe distortions
into the transmitted signal.
Firstly, as performed in the previous scenarios, the performance
of each echo state network considering the noiseless case shall be
analyzed. The obtained results are presented in Table 5.3.
Table 5.3 shows that the nonlinear output layer significantly
improves the performance of the ESN and the ASE-ESN. On the

designed by the method in [48] also provides good performance, but
the improvement of the performance is not very significant.
Second, in the case of Gaussian additive noise, the input of the
echo state network is u(n) = r(n) + σN(0, 1), where σ denotes the
standard deviation of the noise and N(0, 1) corresponds to a zero
mean and unity variance Gaussian random variable.
Assuming N = 60 for both the ESN and the ASE-ESN and
Npc = 6 for the proposed network. For each of the five different SNRs
for each network, 20 independent experiments were performed. The
obtained AMSE values are given in Table 5.4. The dynamic reservoir
layer is designed by the method given in [47], because this choice
achieves a better performance in the absence of the noise.
Table 5.4 shows that as the noise becomes more obvious, the error
increases significantly. However, when SNR value is fixed, the differ￾ence between AMSE values of each network is relatively small, but
the performance of the proposed network is the best.

5.5.4.5 Fourth channel
The transfer function was given as H(Z)=0.38 + 0.6z−1 + 0.6z−2 +
0.38z−3, which causes severe distortion of the transmitted signal. In
the simulation, the number of training and test samples each network
was set to 5500. To avoid transient effects, the first 500 samples were
excluded. The obtained results are shown in Table 5.5.
As it can been seen for Table 5.5, the proposed network has a
better equalization effect than the ESN and the ASE-ESN, which
means that, in this case, not only the recursive structure is necessary,
but also the nonlinear output layer is essential. When the distortions
of the transmitted signals become more pronounced, the proposed
network can indeed achieve more efficient channel equalization.

mappings represents a decisive element for enabling an adequate
recovery of the information. Therefore, this scenario is very use￾ful for the analysis of the processing capability of each ESN. Ulti￾mately, the importance of this scenario is also emphasized by the
evidence that, in certain contexts, like satellite communications, non￾linear channels may be good representations of naturally occurring
channels. In Table 5.6, the performance obtained with the ESNs is
presented.
The results shown in Table 5.6 clearly reveal the advantages of the
proposed network in this case, that is, indeed, the achieved AMSE
values are many orders of magnitude smaller than those associated
with the ESN and the ASE-ESN. Therefore, based on these evi￾dences, it is possible to affirm that the use of a more flexible structure
as the output layer of the echo state network, like the Volterra filter,
was certainly a key factor for the good performance achieved by the
proposed ESN architecture, especially in the cases in which the dis￾tortions became more severe. Furthermore, with the aid of the PCA
technique, the verified improvement in the quality of the equalization
was reached without a significant increase in the complexity of the
network training process, which is another attractive feature offered
by the proposal.

Nonlinear Volterra Channel Blind
Equalization Algorithm
Summary
The nonlinear Volterra channel is researched. By transforming the third￾order nonlinear memory term of the truncated Volterra equalizer into
a second-order memory term, the nonlinear channel equalization algo￾rithm based on the improved structure of Volterra equalizer is proposed.
Based on the analysis of minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based
precise equalization algorithm and time-invariant MMSE coefficients, a
linear MMSE-based turbo equalization and iterative equalization algo￾rithm is analyzed. From the perspective of information theory, the non￾linear channel equalization algorithm based on steady-state analysis of
maximum correlation entropy Volterra filter is discussed. By designing
fuzzy neural network controller and combining with complex neural net￾work polynomial, the complex neural network polynomial Volterra chan￾nel blind equalization algorithm based on fuzzy neural network control is
studied.
Satellite communication is one of the most important commu￾nication technologies currently. This technology can overcome the
problem of long distance communication and is not sensitive to the
interference of various radio waves on the ground. However, there
are various distortions and fading in the satellite channel. Among
them, the nonlinearity caused by both the satellite internal travel￾ing wave tube amplifier (TWTA) and the group delay of the satellite
transmission signals is a typical distortion in the satellite channel [1],
which results in inter-symbol interference (ISI), phase rotation, and

amplitude distortion of the signals, and seriously affects the quality
of the communication. To eliminate the distortion and fading of the
signals, it is necessary to study the signal distortion compensation
method based on the nonlinear satellite channel.
6.1 Nonlinear Channel Adaptive Equalization Algorithm
6.1.1 Nonlinear channel adaptive equalization model
The goal of channel equalization is to recover the original transmitted
signals from the received distortion signal. The equivalent baseband
model of the adaptive channel equalizer is shown in Figure 6.1 [2–4].
In Figure 6.1, χ represents the delay order. The adaptive equal￾izer has the ability to dynamically adjust the filter parameters at
the current moment based on the filter parameters at the previ￾ous moment so that the filter continually approximates the inverse
characteristics of the channel. This self-adjusting and tracking abil￾ity of the adaptive equalizer makes it suitable for real-time signal
processing.
On the one hand, the channel can be divided into the linear chan￾nel and the nonlinear channel in an actual equalization method. It is
feasible for linear equalizer to be used to equalize the linear channel,
whereas it often cannot equalize the nonlinear channel well. In order
to equalize the nonlinear channel, the nonlinear equalizer and the
inverse characteristic of the nonlinear channel must perfectly match.

Nonlinear Volterra Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 303
On the other hand, the basic form of the linear channel can be
roughly determined, that is, the proportional relationship between
the outputs and the inputs manifests is a fixed constant, while the
nonlinear form of the channels varies greatly, and the causes of non￾linearity are also different, and the analytical expressions of nonlinear
are completely different. Therefore, for different nonlinear channels,
the different structures of nonlinear equalizers are needed for equal￾ization, but it depends on the specific nonlinearity.
Studies have shown that the Volterra series can describe the
nonlinear characteristics of a variety of systems. Benedetto et al.
proposed a nonlinear satellite channel Volterra series model based
on MPSK signals according to Salah’s amplitude-phase conversion
model and Volterra series and gave the corresponding Volterra equal￾izer structure [5]. When the input is MPSK signals, its complex enve￾lope can be defined as:
x(t) = 
+∞
n=−∞
a(n)h(t − nT) (6.1.1)
where a(n) is the transmitted symbol sequence and h(t) denotes
the impulse response of the shaping filter. Let y(n) be the output
of the discrete channel. By substituting Equation (6.1.1) into the
Volterra series, the Volterra series model of nonlinear satellite chan￾nel is obtained, i.e.,
y(n) =

(6.1.2)
where a(n) = ejϕn, h(i) is the first-order linear kernel coefficient
of the nonlinear satellite channel, h(i, j, k) denotes the third-order
nonlinear kernel coefficient of the nonlinear satellite channel, and
w(n) is additive noise. When the amplifier works in the linear region,
there is only linear portions and additive noise in Equation (6.1.2). If
the amplifier operates in or near the saturation region, one or moreJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 304

high-order terms will be included in Equation (6.1.2), whose order
depends on the nonlinearity of the satellite channel. Equation (6.1.2)
contains only odd-order terms, and even-order terms are eliminated
during the derivation process. This is because the satellite channel
is regarded as a bandpass filter and the even-order input signals are
out-of-band, which is filtered out during transmission. In addition,
i, j, and k represent the memory of the channel, as the memory
of the channel enhances and the nonlinear term coefficients of the
channel will increase geometrically, which will greatly aggravated the
nonlinear distortion of the signals. So, the distortional channel must
be compensated.
Benedetto pointed out that a nonlinear Volterra series satellite
channel can be equalized by a nonlinear filter with the nonlinear tap
delay structure, a series of complex multipliers, and an accumulat￾ing unit. Taking the third-order truncated Volterra equalizer as an
example, its structure is shown in Figure 6.2.
In Figure 6.2, f(0), f(1),...,f(N − 1) denote linear weight
coefficients of the third-order truncated Volterra equalizer, and
f(0, 0, 0), f(0, 0, 1),...,f(N − 1, N − 1, N − 1) stand for the nonlin￾ear weight coefficients of the third-order truncated Volterra equalizer.
y(n)=[y(n), y(n − 1),...,y(n − N + 1), y2(n)y∗(n),...,y2y∗(n −

The third-order truncated Volterra equalizer can be used to
compensate for the general weak nonlinear distortion. When the
nonlinearity of the channel is enhanced, it is necessary for a higher￾order Volterra equalizer to be used to better compensate for the
nonlinear distortion channel. However, the experiments show that as
the nonlinearity of the channel enhances, the equalization effect of
the Volterra equalizer is not obvious, and as the order of the equal￾izer increases, the computation complexity of the Volterra equalizer
increases geometrically. Therefore, in practical applications, a third￾order or fifth-order Volterra equalizer is generally used.
Table 6.1 shows the simplified coefficients of the nonlinear chan￾nel Volterra series model, which are obtained from statistical experi￾ments based on the PSK signals. Since the PSK signals are not very
sensitive to the nonlinearity of satellite channel, this set of data for
this coefficient is often used to describe a weak nonlinear satellite

channel. Researchers usually use this set of data as the kernel coef￾ficient of the nonlinear satellite channel Volterra series model and
the third-order Volterra equalizer to design the nonlinear satellite
channel equalization algorithm.
6.1.2 Nonlinear channel adaptive equalization
algorithm
The least mean square (LMS) algorithm for a nonlinear satellite
channel is the same as that for the linear channel and its cost function
is defined as:
J = E{|z(n) − a(n)|
2} (6.1.4)
where z(n) is the output signal of the equalizer and a(n) is the desired
signal. After minimizing the cost function in Equation (6.1.4), the
iterative equation of the equalizer weight vector may be given by:
f (n + 1) = f (n) + μy(n)e∗(n) (6.1.5)
where e(n) is the error function, and
e(n) = a(n) − z(n) (6.1.6)
The step-size factor μ in Equation (6.1.5) should satisfy:
0 <μ<
2
λmax
(6.1.7)
where λmax is the maximum value of the eigenvalue of the autocor￾relation matrix of the input signals [6–8]. We call Equations (6.1.5)–
(6.1.7) as a Volterra equalizer algorithm based on the LMS. Since it
has the smallest computation loads and the least storage space, it is
easy to implement it in hardware. However, Figure 6.2 shows that
the input components of a Volterra equalizer are much more complex
than those of the linear equalizers. The weight vector length of the
third-order Volterra equalizer is computed by:
N = 
2
n=1
M2n−1 (6.1.8)
It can be seen from Equation (6.1.8) that the length of the weight
vector increases exponentially with the increase of the channel mem￾ory length or depth, which inevitably increases the dimension and theJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 307

autocorrelation of the input signals and further makes the eigenvalue
expansion of the autocorrelation matrix quite serious (i.e., the eigen￾values of the autocorrelation matrix of the input signal have multiple
different values). The expansion of the eigenvalue of the autocorrela￾tion matrix is represented by the increase of λmax or the decrease of
the step-size μ, which results in the slow convergence of the equalizer.
For many years, researchers have been trying to find some equaliza￾tion algorithms with a fast convergence rate and good equalization
effect of nonlinear satellite channel such as Volterra series structure￾based equalization algorithm and other structure-based equalization
algorithm.
6.1.2.1 Frequency domain Volterra series equalization
algorithm
Linear adaptive algorithms have proved that orthogonal transforms
can reduce the autocorrelation of input signals. Converting the time
domain signal into a frequency domain signal is one of the orthog￾onal transform methods. Compared with the time domain signal,
the equalizer processes the frequency domain signal quickly and the
variable step-size in the equalization algorithm can further improve
the convergence speed. In [9–11], these two methods were com￾bined to obtain the frequency domain variable step-size adaptive
Volterra equalizer. This frequency domain Volterra equalizer struc￾ture is shown in Figure 6.3.
In Figure 6.3, the input signals are transformed by DFT, and the
frequency domain signal is obtained as follows:
Y = DFT(y) (6.1.9)
At this time, Equation (6.1.5) becomes
F(n + 1) = F(n) + μ(n)Y (n)DFT[e∗(n)] (6.1.10)
where F is the transform domain coefficient vector of f ·μ(n) denotes
the modified variable step-size and is defined as:

6.1.2.2 Equalization algorithm based on compression mapping
The basic idea of the equalization algorithm based on compression
mapping is to use both the compression mapping method and iter￾ative method to calculate the original satellite transmitted sequence
according to the output of the satellite channel Volterra series model
at each time. For Equation (6.1.2), the process of solving the trans￾mitted signals from receiving the signals can be regarded as the solu￾tion of the following equation:
T(a(n)) = a(n) + β[y(n) − V (a(n))] (6.1.13)
where V (a(n)) is the satellite channel Volterra series. When a(n) in
Equation (6.1.13) is the fixed point, T(a(n)) = a(n), the function
T(a(n)) is converted to y(n) = V (a(n)), that is, it is the solution of
Equation (6.1.2).
According to the compression mapping fixed-point iterative
method, we get the following formula:
zk+1(n) = zk(n) + β(y(n) − V (zk(n))) (6.1.14)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 309
Nonlinear Volterra Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 309
where k represents the number of iterations, zk+1(n) denotes the
output signal of the equalizer after k iterations, zk(n) denotes
the output signal of the first k−1 iteration equalizer, and y(n) is the
output signal of the satellite channel. All transmitted signal points
can be obtained by multiple iterations.

6.2 Improved Volterra Equalizer for Nonlinear Channel
A third-order Volterra equalizer can be used to compensate for gen￾eral weak nonlinear distortion. When the nonlinearity of the channel
is enhanced, it is necessary for a higher-order Volterra equalizer to
be used to compensate for its effect. Experiments have shown that
when the nonlinearity of the channel is enhanced, the equalization
effect of the higher than third-order Volterra equalizer is not obvious,
and the increase of the order of the equalizer will sharply improve
the computational complexity. Therefore, in practical applications, a
third-order or fifth-order Volterra equalizer is generally used.
6.2.1 Improved nonlinear channel Volterra equalizer
The output of the most frequently used Volterra equalizer based on
Volterra series model for the satellite channel can be written as:
y(n) =
N
−1
i=0
h(i)a(n − i)
+

h(i, j, k)a(n − i)a(n − j)a∗(n − k)
= V (a(n), a(n − 1),...,a(n − N + 1)) (6.2.1)
The output of the corresponding third-order truncated Volterra
equalizer can be written as:
z(n) =
m1 max
m1=0
f(m1)y(n − m1)
+
m1 max
m1=0

m2=0
m3 max
m3=0
f(m1, m2, m3)
× y(n − m1)y(n − m2)y∗(n − m3) (6.2.2)
It has been seen from Equation (6.2.1) that the satellite channel
distortion mainly comes from its nonlinearity and memory, which
introduces the ISI in the receiving signals, whereas the ISI will ulti￾mately affect the correct decision output of the decision device, soJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 311
Nonlinear Volterra Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 311
the ISI must be compensated. The values of m1 max, m2 max, and
m3 max depend on the nonlinear satellite channel characteristics. Ide￾ally, m1 max − 1, m2 max − 1, and m3 max − 1 should all take the
same value as the channel memory depth, but the memory depth
of the channel cannot be determined in advance. In order to bet￾ter compensate for the nonlinearity, m1 max − 1, m2 max − 1, and
m3 max − 1 of the satellite channel should be as large as possible
for the memory depth of the channel, that is, m1 max, m2 max, and
m3 max should be taken as large as possible. However, such a value
would increase the computational complexity of the equalizer. There￾fore, feasible measures must be taken to reduce the computational
complexity.
It is known from Equation (6.2.2) that the computational com￾plexity of the truncated Volterra equalizer mainly comes from the
product of the third-order nonlinear term at the time of m1, m2, and
m3 (m1 = 0, 1, 2,...,m1 max−1, m2 = 0, 1, 2,...,m2 max −1, m3 max −
1). In the ideal state, m1 max − 1, m2 max − 1, and m3 max − 1 should
be equal to the maximum value of the memory depth of each part of
the third-order nonlinear term corresponding to the nonlinear satel￾lite channel and the truncated Volterra equalizer. For third-order
nonlinear terms, if m1 max − 1, m2 max − 1, and m3 max − 1 are all N,
the multiplication of the memory terms of the third-order nonlinear
term requires a total of 2N3 complex multiplications, and the num￾ber of complex multiplications required for each item f(m1, m2, m3)
to be multiplied by the respective equalizer coefficients is included.
Therefore, without considering the number of complex multiplication
of iterative equations of the equalizer, in order to obtain each output
signal point, 3N3 complex multiplication are required when input
signals pass through the truncated third-order nonlinear Volterra
equalizer.
In order to reduce this computational complex, it is necessary to
improve the Volterra equalizer. The idea of the improvement is to
transform the third-order nonlinear term of the truncated Volterra
equalizer into the second-order nonlinear term by a certain trans￾formation. After improving the structure of the Volterra equalizer,
the number of complex multiplications required for the signal to pass
through the equalizer will be reduced from O(N3) to O(N2).
According to this idea, the relationship in structure between the
first-order linear term and the third-order nonlinear term of theJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 312

the nonlinear channel equalizer, as shown in Figure 6.5(a), and it
can be seen from Figure 6.5(a) that this improved structure is a cas￾cade of a nonlinear equalizer and a linear equalizer. Figure 6.5(b)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 313

the input signal of the equalizer, b(n) is the output signal of the non￾linear part of the equalizer, and z(n) is the output signal of the linear
part of the equalizer. The structure of the improved equalizer shows
that the essence of the improvement is to transform the third-order
nonlinear memory multiplication of the truncated Volterra equal￾izer into the second-order memory multiplication. Compared with
the conventional truncated Volterra equalizer, the number of com￾plex multiplications required by the improved equalizer is reduced by
3N3 − 2N2 − N times without considering the number of complexJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 314

multiplications in computing the weight vector of the equalizer. Let
Cload = 3N3 − 2N2 − N (6.2.5)
Cload−1(N) = Cload−1(N)
N = 3N2 − 2N1 − 1 (6.2.6)
Cload−2(N) = N (6.2.7)
When N1 > N2, there is the following relationship:
Cload−1(N1) − Cload−1(N2) = [3(N1 + N2) − 2](N1 − N2) (6.2.8)
Since N1−N2 is a positive integer, and N1 is greater than or equal
to 1, and N2 is greater than or equal to zero, Cload−1(N1) monotoni￾cally increases and is always greater than zero, and Cload(N) is also a
function of a single increase and greater than or equal to zero. When
N > 1 Cload(N) is always a positive integer. It can be seen that the
computational load of the improved equalizer is greatly reduced and
confirmed by the subsequent simulation experiments.
The cost function is now defined as:
J(n) = E{|e(n)|
2} (6.2.9)
where e(n) = a(n)− z(n) is the error function. Let the weight vector
of nonlinear part of the equalizer be Fnon(n) and that of the lin￾ear part be Flin(n). The instantaneous mean square error(MSE) is
used instead of the statistical MSE [12], and the vectors of the equal￾izer tap coefficients are updated by the stochastic gradient descent
method as follows:
Fnon(n + 1) = Fnon(n) + λ1e(n) λe∗(n)
∂Fnon(n) (6.2.10)
Flin(n + 1) = Flin(n) + λ2e(n) λe∗(n)

part and the linear part tap coefficient of equalizer, respectively.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 315

The derivation process of ∇2(n) is as follows:

∂Fnon(n) (6.2.15)

The step-size of the nonlinear and linear parts satisfies the follow￾ing conditions, respectively.
0 <μ< 2/μmax (6.2.17)
0 <λ< 2/λmax (6.2.18)
Let Y = {y(n)y∗(n), y(n)y∗(n − 1),...,y(n − N + 1)y∗(n −
N + 1)} be the input signal vector of the nonlinear equalizer and
B = b(n){y(n), y(n − 1),...,y(n − N + 1)} be the input signal vec￾tor of the nonlinear equalizer. μmax and λmax are the maximum eigen￾values of the autocorrelation matrix of Y and B, respectively. It can
be seen by analyzing Y and B that the nonlinear part of the equal￾izer converges slower than the linear part because the input signal
length of the improved nonlinear part is much larger than that of the
linear part. In the latter simulation, it is found that if the step-sizes of
the linear equalizer and the nonlinear equalizer are different, the per￾formance of the equalizer is unstable, that is to say, the equalizationJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 316
316 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
effect of the equalizer varies greatly each time. In order to speed up
the convergence and keep the stability performance of the equalizer,
the step-size of the nonlinear equalizer should take a larger value,
whereas the step-size of the linear equalizer takes the same value as
the step-size of the nonlinear equalizer.
6.2.2 Algorithm simulations
In simulation tests, the transmission signal was 32APSK, and its
length was 7000. The channel memory depth was set to 3, the iter￾ation step-size of the weight vector for the Volterra equalizer was
set to 0.005, and the iteration step-size of the weight vector for the
improved nonlinear and linear of equalizer was selected to be 0.008.
The first tap coefficient of the Volterra equalizer was initialized to
1, and the other taps were initialized to 0. The center tap of the
improved linear and nonlinear portions of equalizer was set to 1. The
results of 50 Monte Carlo simulations were shown in Figure 6.6. The
MSE in Figure 6.6 is defined as:
MSE = 20 log(MSE(n)) (6.2.19)
It is can be known from Figure 6.6(a) that the MSE curves of
the Volterra equalizer were very jittery. The MSE of the improved
equalizer is smaller than that of the conventional Volterra equalizer,
and the robustness of the curve is better, but its convergence speed
is slower.
Figure 6.6(b) shows that the phase rotation of the inner cir￾cle constellations of the 32APSK signal output from the conven￾tional Volterra equalizer still exists, while that of the 32APSK signal
constellations of the improved equalizer are compact and symmet￾rical, and the phase rotation of constellations has been completely
eliminated.
6.2.3 Computational complexity

analyzed. Since the computation loads of performing a complex mul￾tiplication are much larger than that of performing a complex addi￾tion, the number of complex multiplications required to produceJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 317

complexity.
For a conventional Volterra equalizer, 3N3 + N complex multipli￾cations are required for each output signal point, and N3 + N + 1
complex multiplications are required for the weight vector. For the
improved equalizer, 2N2 + 2N and 2N2 + 3N + 2 complex multiplica￾tions are required for the two processes, respectively. Figure 6.7 shows
that as the depth of channel memory increases, the number of com￾plex multiplications of the conventional Volterra equalizer increasesJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 318

exponentially, while that of the improved Volterra equalizer grows
slowly. When the channel memory depth is large, the complex mul￾tiplication of the improved equalizer is much smaller than that of
the conventional Volterra equalizer. For example, when the chan￾nel memory depth is set to 10, the complex multiplication of the
improved Volterra equalizer is about 1/9 of that of the conventional
Volterra equalizer.
The running time of the equalizer before and after improvement
under different channel memory depths is shown in Table 6.2 when
the length of the transmitting signals is given as 1000. Table 6.2
shows that the computational speed of the improved Volterra equal￾izer is faster than that of the conventional Volterra equalizer when the
length of the transmitting signals is shorter and the channel memory
is not particularly serious.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 319

6.3 Nonlinear Channel Turbo Blind Equalization
Algorithm Based on Linear MMSE
The error correction ability of turbo code is close to the limit [13] in
the Gaussian white noise channel, which is the best performance of
all the coding techniques so far. Satellite channels are time-varying,
frequency-varying, amplitude-varying, and phase-varying. For coher￾ent detection, the receiver must estimate the channel to obtain opti￾mal performance and can obtain channel estimation information
based on pilot symbols. However, the pilot symbols can reduce spec￾tral efficiency. Blind equalization technology is one of the effective
methods to improve spectral efficiency. In this section, turbo code
blind equalization technology is used to study the nonlinear satellite
channel turbo blind equalization algorithm based on linear MMSE
criterion [14–16].
6.3.1 System specification
The turbo equalization principle regards the ISI channel (equivalent
to a convolutional code), interleaver, and channel coding as a serial
cascaded convolutional code, which is used to perform the iterative
equalization and decoding at the receiving end. After one of the two
parallel soft-input soft-output decoders is slightly modified, that is,
its original decoding function is modified into the equalization func￾tion of soft-input soft-output, another soft-input soft-output decoder
is still used for decoding [14]. In this way, both the improved equalizer
and decoder can process the input prior information and the output
posterior information, and the output posterior information can be
interleaved or de-interleaved as the other party’s prior information
to complete the iterative transmission of the external information
between the channel decoder and the equalizer and further obtain
the approximation optimal performance.
A channel coding communication system with Volterra channel
and additive noise is taken as an example and shown in Figure 6.8.
The binary sequence {d(n)} is encoded by an error-correcting code to
produce an encoded bit stream {bn(n)}, which is sent to the bit inter￾leaver, and the interleaved bit stream {c(n)} is input into the linear
modulator (each L bit forms a transmission symbol) to obtain a com￾plex data symbol {x(n)}. Finally, each data symbol passes throughJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 320

the Volterra channel at a time. Suppose that each data block con￾tains M symbols, the relationship between discrete input and output

L01),...,x(n− N2 −L02)]T, w(n)=[w(n− N1),...,w(n+ N2)]T are
represented as a received signal at the nth sampling time, the input
signal of the Volterra channel, and Gaussian white noise, respectively.
Assume that the complex symbols x(n) are totally indepen￾dent of each other and selected from a finite character set A =
{a0, a1,...,a|A|}, the prior probability of the symbols x(n) is given
by:
pni = P(x(n) = a(n)), n = 0, 1,...,M − 1;i = 0, 1,..., |A| (6.3.2)
When a priori information is available, pni = 1/|A|, i.e., all sym￾bols are equal probability.
Further assume that the additive noise sequence w(n) is a complex
independent and identically distributed Gaussian random variable
with zero mean and is independent of the symbol sequence x(n).
The variance of each noise sample value is σ2.
Let y = {y(0), y(1),...,y(M − 1)}, in the absence of the chan￾nel information h and noise parameters, the posterior probability

the receiver is generally designed under additive noise, it also has a
good inhibitory effect on the symbol correlation caused by ISI. Gen￾erally, the process of reducing the influence of the ISI between trans￾mission data is referred to as “Equalization” and “Detection”, while
the process of recovering data from the equalized symbols is referred
to as “Decoding”. The receiver structure is shown in Figure 6.9.
In the receiver, ˆx(n), ˆc(n), and ˆb(n) are sequentially obtained from
the equalizer to the decoder as estimates of x(n), c(n), and b(n),

The output signal of the MMSE equalizer is written as:
xˆ(n) = aH(n)y(n) + b(n) (6.3.8)
The MMSE E[|xˆ(n) − x(n)|

from Equation (6.3.8). The time-varying MMSE coefficient is com￾puted as follows:
a(n) = Cov(y(n), y(n))−1Cov(y(n), x(n)) (6.3.9)
b(n) = E[x(n)] − aH(n)E[y(n)] (6.3.10)
According to Cov(x, y)  E[xyH ] − E[x]E[y H ], get

The following equations can be obtained by Equations (6.3.13)

Since there is an interleaver between the decoder and the equal￾izer, whose main function is to reset the bit order of the input signal
sequence so that the sequence correlation before and after the inter￾leaving is zero, so that the input characters are independent of each
other. Therefore, the mean value of the conjugate product between
p characters and q–p characters is obtained as follows:

the calculation process, and matrix transposition also contains anJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 325

amount of computational complexity. However, since there is a com￾mon submatrix in the continuous instantaneous covariance matrix in
Equation (6.3.21), the computation complexity can be significantly
reduced by the fast recursion method.
6.3.2.2 Time-invariant MMSE coefficient
The calculation of the exact MMSE equalizer can be approximated
by the computation load of computing the minimum RMS coeffi￾cient, or the computation load of the time-invariant equalizer can
be determined without prior information [17]. This section proposes
two time-invariant approximation algorithms. The main difference
between them is reflected in the MMSE coefficients.
6.3.2.2.1 MMSE approximation algorithm without prior
information
At the beginning of equalizing, it is assumed that there is no a priori
information to calculate the MMSE coefficients. In this case, for any
n, E[x(n)] = 0, v(n) = 1. However, since the nonlinear ISI term is
related to the modulation order, the channel coefficient, the modula￾tion method (PSK, QAM, APSK, . . . ), etc., there is no the expression
of the simplified MMSE coefficient.
When the symbols are extracted from the constant modulus mod￾ulation, the third-order kernel (i, j, k) (i = k, j = k) of the channel is
present, otherwise it contributes to the linear ISI portion. Therefore,
this can be reflected in the modulated signals of the second order or
more. According to this conclusion, for ∀n, ∀(i, j, k), there are:
∀n, ∀(i, j, k) E[xijk(n)] = 0 N×1 (6.3.21)
∀n, ∀(i, j, k) Cov(x(n), xijk(n)) = 0 N+L01+L02×N (6.3.22)
∀n, ∀(i, j, k) Cov(xijk(n), x(n)) = 0 N×N+L01+L02 (6.3.23)
∀n, ∀(i, j, k) = (i

(n)) = 0 N (6.3.24)
∀n, ∀(i, j, k) Cov(xijk(n), xijk(n)) = I N (6.3.25)
These simplify Equation (6.3.10). Now, the NA-MMSE coefficient
can be written as:

6.3.2.2.2 MMSE approximation algorithm for Low Complexity
On the basis of no a priori information, the idea of the time-invariant
MMSE approximation with the LC-MMSE is to compute the MMSE
filter with the minimum 1
L
L−1
n=0 E[|xˆ(n)−x(n)|

According to this idea, the optimal solution is given by:

where 1

further simplified by assuming that the secondary effect is neg￾ligible, which results in 1
L
L−1
n=0 Cov(y(n), y(n)) = vIN , v =
1
L
L−1
n=0 Var(x(n)).
As far as the third-order covariance matrix is concerned, it can
only show a Toeplitz structure [18]. Since only one matrix inversion
operation under every L equalized symbol is required, the computa￾tional complexity is slightly reduced. Therefore, compared with the
NA-MMSE algorithm, the computation loads of the LC-MMSE are
only 1/L of that of the NA-MMSE algorithm.
6.3.2.2.3 Soft demapper
To map the output of the equalizer to code LLRs, the residual output
error of the equalizer is defined as e(n)=ˆx(n) − x(n). Assume that
the residual error e(n) is a Gaussian type with zero mean, its variance
is written as:
Var(e(n)) = 1 + Cov(ˆx(n), xˆ(n)) − 2Re(Cov(ˆx(n), x(n)))
For the exact MMSE algorithm, its variance can be written as:
Var(e(n)) = 1 − Cov(x(n), y(n))a(n)
For the NA-MMSE algorithm, the computational complexity of
its error variance is greater than that of the exact MMSE algorithm,
and it may be called as NA-MMSE-A. In literature [19], the role
of the third-order Volterra term is ignored, and a simplified NA￾MMSE error variance method, called as NA-MMSE-B, is given. The
computational complexity of the NA-MMSE-B is lower than that ofJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 327
Nonlinear Volterra Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 327
NA-MMSE-A, but the nonlinear term is not eliminated. When the
SNR is very high, the NA-MMSE-B will no longer be accurate.
The equalizer output ˆx(n)∼ N (x(n), Var(e(n))) and the output
a posteriori LLR Lap can be written as:
Lap(ci(n)|xˆ(n))
= ln P(ci(n)=0|xˆ(n))

The a posteriori LLRs are made extrinsic Le by subtracting the
prior probability fed by the decoder.
Le(ci(n)) = Lap(ci(n)|xˆ(n)) − L(ci(n)) (6.3.29)
6.3.2.3 Algorithm simulation
In the simulation, the convolutional code of the generated polyno￾mial is used, the generated polynomial is [5, 7], code rate is 1/2, the
modulation signal is 8PSK, and the coding bits are randomly inter￾leaved and mapped. At the receiver, the MMSE equalizer param￾eters are N1 = 5 and N2 = 3. The output of the soft demapper
is de-interleaved and then forwarded to the maximum a posteriori
probability (MAP) decoder. The output of the decoder is interleaved
again and transmitted to the equalizer. The channel is a typical
nonlinear Volterra satellite channel, and its parameter expression is
shown in Equation (6.3.31), and the simulation results are shown in
Figure 6.11.

Figure 6.11 shows the bit error rate (BER) curves of the four
equalizers include accurate MMSE linear equalizer (exact MMSE),
MMSE equalizer with no a priori information for accurate error vari￾ance (NA-MMSE-A), MMSE equalizer with simplified error variance
without a priori information (NA-MMSE-B), and low complexity
MMSE equalizer (LC-MMSE). It can be seen from Figure 6.11 that
when iterating once, there is no obvious difference in the perfor￾mance of the four equalizers, but when the number of iterations
increases to three times, their BERs (bit error rates) are significantly
reduced, which is more and more close to the performance without
ISI channel, and among them, the BER of the accurate MMSE is
the best. The BER performance of the approximation algorithmsJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 329
Nonlinear Volterra Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 329
such as NA-MMSE and LC-MMSE is very close to that of the accu￾rate MMSE, whereas the BER performance of the accurate MMSE,
NA-MMSE, and LC-MMSE is significantly better than that of the
simplified NA-MMSE. If the iteration continues, their performance
can be further improved, but in terms of the time required by the
iteration and performance improvement, it is unnecessary to continue
to iterate.
6.3.3 Iterative blind equalization algorithm
based on linear MMSE
This section mainly discusses a blind iterative equalizer, which con￾sists of a soft feedback equalizer with linear complexity and a MMSE
channel estimator with linear complexity [20]. The inherent block
processing structure of turbo receiver and its careful selection of filter
parameters are used to overcome the shortcomings of low bandwidth
utilization and numerical instability for blind equalization algorithm
based on linear MMSE.

b = [b(1), b(2),...,b(N)], and the code rate is R = K/N. In order to
improve performance, c = [c(1), c(2),...,c(N)] is obtained by using
a random interleaver.
The channel model can be composed of a transmit filter, a chan￾nel, and a receive filter. The output of the equivalent discrete-time
channel model can be expressed as:
y(n) = 
L
l=0
h(l)x(n − l) + w(n) = hT x(n) + w(n) 0 ≤ k ≤ N
(6.3.31)
where L is the channel memory length, h = [h(1), h(2),...,h(N)]T
is a channel coefficient vector, x(n)=[x(n), x(n − 1),...,x(n − L)]T
represents the state transition of the kth mesh segmentation [19],
and w(n) is the noise sample vector.
6.3.3.2 SISO equalizer
The tapped delay line model of the ISI channel and the lattice
response of the channel are shown in Figures 6.13 and 6.14, respec￾tively. Assume that the length of the impulse response is L, the model
contains L − 1 delay units. Thus, for a given binary input character
set {+1, −1}, the channel has 2L−1 states s(i)(i = 0, 1,..., 2L−1−1),
and a collection of possible states may be represented as S =
{s(0), s(1),...,s(2L−1 −1)}. At every moment n = 0, 1, 2,...,N −1,
the channel state is a random variable s(n) ∈ S. Given a state
s(n), s(n+1), according to one of only two possible states of input +1
and −1, if there are only eight branches in this section, the channel
can be any of the four states, so the state transition probability can

where a ∈ {0, 1}. Assume that the data bits are subject to indepen￾dent and identical distribution, then Pr(a(n) = a)=1/2. According

6.3.3.4 Algorithm simulation
In simulation tests, the impulse response of the Proakis’ B channel
h(n)=0.408σ(n+1)+0.815σ(n)+0.408σ(n−1) was selected [21]. The
coding method adopts the R = 1/2 system recursive convolutional
code, the constraint length was set to 3, the generated vector was
g = [111, 110] = [7, 5], random interleaving was adopted, the size
of information bit block was 128bit, and BPSK modulation (M =
256) was used, the SNR was defined as SNR = 10 log(E/N0R) =
10 log(1/2σ2R)dB, and the number of iterations was set to 3. The
simulation results are shown in Figure 6.16.
Figure 6.16 shows that as the number of iterations increases, the
performance of iterative blind equalization algorithm based on linear
MMSE gets better and better. The initial iterative coding gain is
higher, but as the number of iterations increases, the gain growth will
be relatively slow, and the BER of the system will change slightly on
an order of magnitude and get closer and closer to the performance
of the AWGN.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 334

6.4 Linear Frequency Domain Turbo Equalization
Algorithm Based on Nonlinear Volterra Channel
The increasing demand for high data rates urges new communica￾tion systems to provide both high spectral and power efficiency.
In recent satellite communications standards, this trade-off can be
achieved using multi-level amplitude constellations such as ampli￾tude and phase-shift keying (APSK). However, such modulations
increase the signal fluctuations and thus give rise to nonlinear dis￾tortions when being passed through a high power amplifier (HPA)
operating near saturation. These distortions can be either mitigated
at the transmitter using signal or symbol pre-distortion or at the
receiver using equalization. To do so, analytical expressions for the
nonlinear channel have been widely investigated [22–24]. [22, 23] use
a triple-effect representation of the nonlinear channel, consisting of
additive noise, a scalar multiplication, and warping. This approxima￾tion, although practical, is not accurate for higher-order modulations
since the additive noise cannot be considered circular for outer ring
symbols. Another category of channel models consists of a decom￾position of the nonlinear channel by means of Taylor series leading
to the so-called Volterra representation. The Volterra series repre￾sentation has been applied to different transmission channels such asJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 335

the nonlinear magnetic channel and differential impulse radio UWB
systems in [25, 26].
As far as satellite channels are concerned, a Volterra series expan￾sion or a decomposition depends on the chain filters, the HPA model,
the modulation type, and the input back-off (IBO). Based on this
Volterra series expansion, the satellite channel can be represented as
a finite state machine, which allows for optimal symbol and sequence
detection, maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) and maximum
likelihood sequence detection (MLSD). However, as the complex￾ity of these optimal equalizers is exponential in the channel mem￾ory, the low complexity equalizers have been investigated among
which we will focus on iterative solutions. Indeed, new equalization
trends are based on iterative receivers for their excellent Shannon￾bound approaching abilities [27–29]. In [29], an iterative time domain
MMSE-based equalizer was presented to mitigate the channel linear
and nonlinear interference, and different low complexity approxima￾tions were investigated. The investigated performances show that a
No a priori approximation has minor performance degradation but
far less complexity than the exact MMSE solution. Non-iterative fre￾quency domain equalization algorithm for nonlinear channels [30]
based on an adaptive block LMS equalizer can reduce the computa￾tional complexity further. Obviously, a complexity comparison shows
the advantage of using frequency rather than time domain equaliza￾tion. In this section, we use the frequency domain Volterra chan￾nel model to derive an iterative linear MMSE FDE. As argued for
the time domain solution in [29], time domain linear equalization
is able to cope with both linear and nonlinear interference. Simi￾larly, the proposed iterative FDE is able to cancel both linear and
nonlinear soft symbols which asymptotically approaches the AWGN
ISI-free performance. The remainder of this section is organized as
follows: first, the frequency domain Volterra channel model is pro￾posed; second, the iterative linear MMSE-FDE based on the No A
priori MMSE approximation is derived; finally, the performance of
the MMSE equalizer implementations is investigated.

both the power and phase of the output signal y and the amplitude
of the input signal x is as follows:
y = c(|x|) exp(jϕ(x)) = A(|x|) exp(j(Φ(|x|) + ϕ(x))) (6.4.5)
The memory function is added to the receiving response transmit￾ting filter. In the whole satellite transponder response, the symbols
received in the receiver are decomposed into Volterra odd series. In
this way, the decomposition expression of the received symbol y(n)
is represented by the Volterra odd series as:

where v defines the decomposition order of the Volterra series.
h(n1,...,n2m+1) is called the Volterra kernel and w(n) is the fil￾tered sample additive noise with variance σ2
w. The overall system can
be described by Figure 6.17. The Volterra decomposition of satellite
transponders with Butterworth filters is given in [27], and orders

Therefore, the nonlinear interference can be expressed as a 1D − DFT

6.4.3.1 Turbo MMSE FDE
The linear MMSE equalizer consists of an affine estimation of the
received symbols [33].
xˆ(n) = aH (n)y + b(n) (6.4.15)
which computes estimates that minimize the MSE with the transmit￾ted symbols E[|xˆ(n)−x(n)|
2], so the time-varying MMSE coefficients
are given as follows:

a(n) = Cov( y,y)−1Cov(y, x(n))
b(n) = E[x(n)] − aH(n)E[y] (6.4.16)
where Cov(x, y)E[xy H ] − E[x]E[y H ], leading to:
xˆ(n) = aH(n)(y − E[y]) + E[x(n)] (6.4.17)
In order to eliminate all linear and nonlinear interference, the
symbol x(n) can only remove linear terms. This allows for a per￾fect reconstruction of the nonlinear soft interference and thus its fullJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 341

cancellation at perfect priors. The estimated symbols can thus be
expressed as:
xˆ(n) = aH(n)(y − E[y]) + aH(n)Hu(n)E[x(n)] (6.4.18)
As discussed in [31], the computational complexity of time￾varying exact MMSE is high. This has resulted into investigating
some low-complexity MMSEs, among which we select the No A pri￾ori implementation. The MMSE approximation solution with No
A priori information is written as follows:
CY Y  Cov(y,y) = σ2
wIIN + HH H + 
(i,j,k)
|h(i, j, k)|
2IIN
CY x(n)  Cov(y, x(n)) = Hu(n)
Nonlinear interference can be described by Gaussian additive
white noise with a variance of σ2
i = (i,j,k)|h(i, j, k)|
2
. Therefore,
by defining the overall noise variance, σ2
w = σ2
i + σ2
w,
CY Y = σ2
wIIN + HH H (6.4.19)
The NA − MMSE solution can thus be written as:
xˆ(n) = uT (n)H HC−1
Y Y (y − E[y]) + uT (n)H HC−1
Y Y Hu(n)E[x(n)]
(6.4.20)
where C = uT (n)H HC−1
Y Y Hu(n) is a constant ∀n ∈ {0,...,N − 1}.
Therefore, the succinct form of the estimated symbols can be writ￾ten as:
xˆ = H HC−1

In order to compute the MMSE coefficients, one needs to com￾pute expectations of E[xijk] and E[x], i.e., expectation of products

Due to the presence of an interleaver between the decoder and the
equalizer, symbols can be considered mutually independent. There￾fore, the expectation of a product of p symbols and q − p symbol

6.4.3.2 Soft demapper
To map the output of the equalizer to an encoded LLR, the dis￾tribution of the estimation error e(n)=ˆx(n) − k(n)x(n) should be
computed instead of the distribution of ˆx(n) given x(n) turns out to
be a practical choice, since one does not need to track the occurrences
of x(n) in third-order covariances. For practical consideration, this
error is assumed to be Gaussian. More precisely:

(6.4.29)
It can be seen that the expectation of the residual error is

are then interleaved and mapped into 8PSK symbols using a gray

namely, the exact MMSE linear equalizer, the time domain MMSE
equalizer (MMSE-TDE), and the frequency domain MMSE equal￾izer (MMSE-FDE). The exact MMSE refers to the full complexity
time domain equalizer, whereas the MMSE-TDE refers to the time
domain NA-MMSE-B. All time domain equalizers were simulated
without CP, and hence the MMSE-FDE is shifted by 0.0254 dB to
account for the loss of spectral efficiency. The performance of the fre￾quency domain equalizer is comparable to that of the time domain
equalizer.

Algorithm Based on Maximum Correlation
Entropy Volterra Filter
Over the past decade, several improved algorithms based on l2-norm
have been developed to improve the performance of recursive
least squares(RLS) algorithm [34, 35]. However, if the second-order
moments of additive noise are infinite, the 2 norm-based algorithm
may fail to work [36,37]. If the additive noises in underwater acoustic
channel and VHF radio can be well-modeled by a stable α distribu￾tion model [37], the performance of the RLS algorithm based on the
stable distributed noise background is degraded because it has no
finite second-order or higher-order moments. For the minimum kernel
based on Wirtingers calculus, the LMS algorithm and the enhanced
LMS kernel algorithm based on linear estimation have been used to
solve the nonlinear channel equalization problem. For non-Gaussian
signals, the MSE criterion is a suboptimal criterion because it does
not consider the influence of higher moments.
Recently, the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) provides a
measure of the local similarity between two random variables. Due
to its simplicity and low sensitivity to singular value noise, MCC is
often used as a basic criterion for adaptive filtering.
In this section, a complex-valued recursive Volterra filter, called
Volterra–CMCC, is described. The filter is based on the complex
maximum correlation entropy criterion and still effectively equalizes
nonlinear channels in the presence of a large number of singular val￾ues or under α-stable noise.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 347

6.5.1 Algorithm theory
Figure 6.20 shows a discrete-time model of a communication system,
where transmission occurs over a nonlinear channel and an adaptive
equalizer is employed in front of the receiver. The error signal of the
adaptive equalizer can be defined as:
e(n) = d(n) − y(n) = a(n − χ) − y(n) (6.5.1)
where a(n) is the transmitted signal (i.e., known training sequence),
d(n) = a(n − χ) is the desired signal or reference signal, χ is the
propagation delay associated with the communication channel, and
y(n) is the output of the equalizer.
The output of the nonlinear channel is defined as:
x(n) = y{a(n)} (6.5.2)
The input to the equalizer (disturbed signal) is written as:
y(n) = x(n) + w(n) (6.5.3)
where w(n) is the additive noise. Considering the computation com￾plexity of the Volterra filter, a second-order Volterra (SOV) expan￾sion [38] is applied here. The expanded input vector x(n) of the SOV
filter is expressed as:

where M represents the length of the linear kernel. The length
L of the second-order Volterra filter can be computed by L =
M(M + 3)/2. Therefore, the input signal x(n) can be equalized by
the equalizer to reduce the influence of the channel and the trans￾mitted signal can be recovered according to the received signal sam￾ples. An α-stabilized noise distribution model describing the impulse
noise can be denoted by a probability density function (PDF) with￾out a closed solution. The characteristic function of a symmetric
α-stable distribution, which is the Fourier transform of the PDF,
can be described by:
Φ(t) = exp{−γ|t|
α} (6.5.5)
where 0 <α< 2 represents the characteristic index and γ denotes the
dispersion parameter whose behavior is similar to the variance of the
Gaussian distribution. A small α indicates the highly impulse noise.
In particular, if α = 2, Equation (6.5.5) becomes the characteristic
function of the Gaussian distribution.
6.5.2 Volterra–CMCC algorithm

the correlation entropy between D and Y is defined as [39]:
V (D, Y ) = E{κ(D, Y )} =

D,Y (d, y) (6.5.6)
where κ(·, ·) is a shift-invariant Mercer kernel and RD,Y (d, y) stands
for the joint distribution function of (d, y). The correlation entropy
kernel function in this section is selected as the Gaussian kernel, i.e.,

Figure 6.21 Cost function of MCC in joint space.
The MCC is used to measure the similarity between two random
variables, whose value is mainly determined by the kernel function.
Figure 6.21 shows the cost function ζ(d, y) of the MCC in the joint
space of d and y. For a Gaussian kernel, the MCC divides the joint
space into three regions. When the two points are close, the MCC
behaves like the l2-norm distance in Euclidean space. When the two
points are separated, the MCC behaves like the l1-norm. When the
two points are gradually separated, they eventually become similar
to the l0-norm [39]. This property shows the robust performance of
the correntropy for outliers. In order to achieve the improved per￾formance of the algorithm, the RLS-based algorithm is usually pre￾ferred. Therefore, the cost function of the Volterra−CMCC is defined
as follows:

(6.5.14)
Then, the expression of f (n) is obtained as follows:

where

For ψ(i, n) = 1, this algorithm becomes the RLS algorithm. When
ψ(i, n) = 1, R(n) and π(n) are weighted autocorrelation matrix
and the weighted cross-correlation vector of the optimal weights via
ψ(i, n). At each iteration, Equation (6.5.15) needs to be recalculated.
In order to avoid this inconvenience, a sliding window method is pro￾posed in [40]. However, the main disadvantage of this sliding window
strategy algorithm is that all previous samples within a window needJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 351

to be saved in memory. To overcome this disadvantage, R(n) and
π(n) are updated by a recursive method as follows:
R(n) ≈ n
i=0
λn−i

λn−i
ψ(i, i)d∗(i)x(i) = λπ(n − 1) + ψ(n, n)x(n)d∗(n)
(6.5.17)
It should be emphasized that the adaptive results of Equa￾tions (6.5.15) and (6.5.17) are similar to the Wiener solution and
it is necessary to carry out the matrix inverse operations in order
to obtain the equalization results. So, the computation complexity
of Equation (6.5.15) is very high and is seldom used in practice. By
using the matrix inversion lemma [41], F(n) can be expressed as:
F(n) = λ−1F(n − 1) − λ−1Φ(n)x H(n)F(n − 1) (6.5.18)
when F(0) = ρ−1I , ρ is a small positive number. The gain factor is
defined by:
Φ(n) = ψ(n, n)F(n − 1)x(n)
λ + ψ(n, n)xH(n)F(n − 1)x(n)
Therefore, f (n) can be updated as:
f (n) = f (n − 1) + Φ(n)[d∗(n) − x H (n)f (n − 1)] (6.5.19)
Note 1: Note that Equations (6.5.14) and (6.5.19) indicate an
implicit relationship between f (n) and ψ(n, n) that cannot be solved
in one step. Therefore, the algorithm requires an iterative approxi￾mation to the solution, where ψ(n, n) is calculated by using f (n−1),
and the new value for f (n) is obtained via the value of ψ(n, n).
Note 2: Since no a priori information about the noise characteris￾tics is required, the proposed algorithm is nearly blind and can be
implemented using only σ and λ.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 352

6.5.3 Steady-state performance
The steady-state performance of the Volterra–CMCC algorithm is
now analyzed. Since the output of the Volterra depends on the lin￾earity of the coefficients of the filter itself, the steady-state excess
MSE (EMSE) of the Volterra–CMCC algorithm is calculated by the
method in [40, 41]. Considering the expected response arising from
the model,
d(n) = f H
optx(n) + w(n) (6.5.20)
where f opt is a vector containing the best coefficient values.
Define the weight deviation vector as:
Ω(n) = f 0 − f (n) (6.5.21)
Now, some assumptions are given as:
(1) The input signal x(n) is a zero-mean independent and identi￾cally distributed (i.i.d.) and is approximately independent of the
a priori excess error.
(2) The noise signal w(n) is i.i.d. with zero mean and variance σ2
w.
(3) w(n) and x(n) are mutually independent.
The iterative equation of the weight vector deviation vector of the
Volterra–CMCC algorithm can be given by:
Ω(n) = Ω(n − 1) − ψ(n, n)F(n − 1)x(n)
λ + ψ(n, n)x H(n)F(n − 1)x(n)
· [d∗(n) − x H (n)f (n − 1)] (6.5.22)

formula, we have
F −1(n) = λn+1ρI +n
i=0
λn−i
ψ(i, i)x H(i)x (i) (6.5.23)
Therefore, Equation (6.5.22) can be simplified as:
Ω(n) = Ω(n − 1) − ϑ(n)F(n)x H(n)e(n) (6.5.24)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 353

In the steady-state, the a posteriori error is defined as:
ep(n) = x H(n)Ω(n)
Equation (6.5.24) is multiplied by x(n), and the relationship
between the a priori and the a posteriori estimation errors can be
written as:
ep(n) = ea(n) − ||x(n)||2
F(n)ϑ(n)e(n) (6.5.25)
where ||x(n)||2
Λ = x∗Λx represents the squared-weighted Euclidean
norm of a vector x(n). When x(n) = 0, the energy conservation
relation (ECR) expression for the Volterra–CMCC algorithm can be
given as:

we have

assumption, the following approximation can be made:
E{||Ω(n)||2
ϑ−1(n)F −1(n)} ≈ E{||Ω(n − 1)||2
ϑ−1(n)F −1(n)} (6.5.28)

According to Equation (6.5.23), the steady-state value of F −1(n)
is obtained as:
F −1  limn→∞ E{F −1(n)} = E{ψ(n, n)}Q(n)
1 − λ
where Q(n) = E{x(n)xH (n)} is the covariance matrix. According to
the approximation estimate in [41] and using the second-order Taylor
series, the following approximation estimate can be made:
E{F(∞)} ≈ (E{F −1(∞)})

When 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, there is |ea(n)|≤|w(n)| in the steady state.
Therefore, substituting Equation (6.5.34) into Equation (6.5.33), one
gets

Equation (6.5.35) is difficult to further simplify. The theoretical
result contains a random variable w(n), but after the expect opera￾tion, an exact value can be obtained. In addition, Equation (6.5.35) is
also applicable to the analysis of linear CMCC algorithms. The

signals, the RLS algorithm requires 4M2 + 12M − 1 real additions
and 4M2 + 16M + 1 real multiplications. By using the SOV expan￾sion, the Volterra–RLS algorithm requires M2 + M real additions
and 2M2 + 2M real multiplications. Therefore, the Volterra–RLS
algorithm requires a total of 5M2 + 13M − 1 real additions and
6M2 + 16M + 1 real multiplications. The Volterra–CMCC algorithm
moderately increases the computational complexity.

the simulation results agree quite well with the theoretical results.
6.5.4.2 Application to nonlinear channel equalization
In order to study the performance of the Volterra–CMCC algorithm
for nonlinear channel equalization, the SOV filter [38] was used. To
compare the BER performance of the Volterra–RLS and Volterra–
CMCC algorithms fairly, the forgetting factor was changed to make
them have similar convergence rates.
The SNR is defined as [38]:
SNR = σ2
x
γ (6.5.36)
where σ2
x represents the power of the input vector.
The relationship between the transmitted signal and the channel
output is written as:
x(n) = a(n) − 0.5a(n − 1) + 0.001a2(n)+0.002a2(n − 1)
+ 0.007a(n)a(n − 1) (6.5.37)
The transmitted signal was a 2-PAM signal. The characteristic
index α of the noise was set to 1.8. The length of the SOV filter
was set to L = 14 with the memory length of linear kernels set to
M = 4, and the memory length of the quadratic kernel was 10. In
α-stable noise, the BER performance of the algorithms was shownJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 358

with some uncertainties and inaccuracies. In recent years, fuzzy neu￾ral networks (FNNs), which combines neural networks with fuzzy
systems, have been proposed. In fuzzy neural networks, the numer￾ical control parameters and connection matrix of neurons can be
replaced by fuzzy parameters, which have stronger expressive abil￾ity, faster training speed, and more robust performance than conven￾tional neural networks. In this case, ambiguity means more flexibility
in the definition of the system, that is, the boundaries of the system
are more ambiguous, and the system itself can be reconstructed for
optimum performance.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 359

6.6.1.1 Topological structure of fuzzy neural networks
Different fuzzy neural network models have different network con￾trol structures, but they have the same topological structure, that
is, fuzzy neural networks are basically three-layer structures includ￾ing fuzzy layer, fuzzy reasoning layer, and defuzzification layer, its
structure is shown in Figure 6.24.
The first layer is called the fuzzification layer. The fuzzification
layer can implement the fuzzification of the input variables to com￾pute a membership function. The fuzzification layer is an essential
part of every fuzzy neural network.
The second layer is called the fuzzy reasoning layer. The fuzzy
reasoning layer is the most important part of the network structure
and is related to the premise and conclusion of fuzzy reasoning and
realizes the fuzzy mapping of the network. The fuzzy reasoning layer
with diversified structures may be a back propagation network, a
radial basis function network, or other forms of neural networks.
Different algorithms correspond to different structures, but the main
difference of various different structures of the FNN lies in the fuzzy
reasoning layer.
The third layer is called the defuzzification layer. This layer trans￾forms the fuzzy state of the inference conclusion into a determined
state and then gives a determined output to perform on the system.
In some specific neural networks, it is not a necessary structure,
which depends on the specific conditions.
In order to enhance the adaptability of the fuzzy neural network,
the fuzzification layer, the fuzzy inference layer, and the defuzzifica￾tion layer are usually composed of multiple networks, which need to
be determined according to specific needs. In this way, the automatic
adjustment of both the membership function and the fuzzy rule in
the inference model can be realized through network learning.

error (MSE) is reduced by defining the step-size parameters, but it
is difficult to improve the convergence speed and reduce the steady￾state error at the same time. The fuzzy neural network controller uses
human experience knowledge to construct fuzzy rules and extracts
information from the MSE signals to control the parameters of the
constant modulus blind equalization algorithm. To solve the con￾tradiction between convergence speed and convergence accuracy, at
the initial stage of running the algorithm, a large step-size is used
to accelerate the convergence speed. As the algorithm continues to
iterate, the step-size is decreased to reduce the steady-state residual
error. The structure of the FNN controller is shown in Figure 6.25.
6.6.1.3 Fuzzy neural network control process
The first layer is called the input layer. ΔMSE and MSE are the
input variables of the controller, i.e.,
μ1(1) = ΔMSE, μ1(2) = MSE (6.6.1)
O1(i, j) = μ1(i), i = 1, 2; j = 1, 2, 3 (6.6.2)June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 361
Nonlinear Volterra Channel Blind Equalization Algorithm 361
where μ1 is the input of the first layer and O1 is the output of the
first layer.
The second layer is called the fuzzification layer. ΔMSE and
MSE are divided into three fuzzy levels, respectively.
μ2(i, j) = O1(i, j) i = 1, 2; j = 1, 2, 3 (6.6.3)
O2(i, j) = exp "

#
(6.6.4)
where m(i, j) and q(i, j) represent the corresponding Gaussian func￾tion centers and bandwidth, respectively. For convenience, fixed cen￾ter and bandwidth are used in this section.
The third layer is called the rule layer. The number of nodes in
this layer is the product of the number of fuzzy sets of each input
variable, and each node of the layer represents the front part of a
rule, where

rule post) are synthesized, i.e.,

The complex neural polynomial network structure is shown in
Figure 6.26. This structure consists of two simple parts: a single-layer
neural network and a nonlinear memoryless processor [47]. Among
them, the input of the nonlinear processor is limited by a nonlinear
constraint function in a certain area, which ensures the convergence
and stability of the nonlinear processor.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 363

6.6.3.1 64APSK signal
With the increase of digital broadband satellite service and the
expansion of system capacity, the spectrum bandwidth resources are
becoming more and more scarce, and the use cost is more and more
expensive. The signal transmission will consider the use of a combi￾nation of amplitude and phase of high-order modulation to improve
the bandwidth efficiency. However, the traditional rectangular QAM
has many amplitudes. When it passes through the satellite nonlinear
transponder, some points are far away from the saturation point, and
the power efficiency is not high. Moreover, the nonlinear distortion of
the signal points close to the saturation state is very serious, which
increases the complexity of the pre-distortion correction.
In the design of modulation constellation which adapts to high
spectral efficiency of satellite channel, it is a trend to adopt a high￾order scheme and reduce the fluctuation of signal amplitude as much
as possible. In this trend, a star-shaped APSK signals with a circular
constellation shape and a small number of circles will be the first
choice [49, 50].
An APSK signal is equivalent to a special QAM signal, whose
constellation diagram is composed of several concentric circles, and
these signal points are, respectively, distributed on the concentric
circles of the outer ring and the inner ring. On the one hand, the
APSK signals have the characteristics of high band utilization of
multi-modulus signals, on the other hand, its amplitude component
is far less complicated than that of the QAM signal. Figure 6.27 shows
the constellations of 64QAM and 64APSK signals with n1+n2+n3+
n4 − APSK type. n1 denotes the number of constellation points at
the first inner circle of the n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 − APSK type from
the inside to the outside, n2 stands for the number of constellationJune 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 365

points at the second circle of the n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 − APSK type, n3
indicates the number of signal constellation points at the third circle,
and n4 represents that the number of signal constellation points at
the fourth circle.
Figure 6.27 shows that 64QAM has 10 amplitude components,
while 4+12+16+32-APSK signal has only 4 amplitude components.
In addition to the 4 + 12 + 16 + 32-APSK signal, there is a 4 + 12 +
20+ 28-APSK signal, and its constellations are also composed of four
concentric circles and four different amplitude components. n1, n2,
and n3 are the number of constellation points of each circle of the
n1+n2+n3+n4−APSK signal from the inner ring to the outer ring.
For n1 +n2+n3+n4−APSK signal, there are 4+ 12+ 16+ 32-APSK
signal, 4 + 12 + 20 + 28-APSK signal, 4 + 8 + 24 + 28 − APSK signal,
and 4 + 8 + 20 + 32 − APSK signal, and so on.
This section mainly studies the equalization problem of 4 + 12 +
20 + 28-APSK and 4 + 12 + 16 + 32-APSK signal passing through
the Volterra channel. For the constellations of these two signals, the
MATLAB simulation results are shown in Figure 6.28.

In the same way, the partial derivative of H (n) can be obtained
by:

∂H (n) = e(n)Z ∗(n)S(n) (6.6.31)
Therefore, the weight vector of the nonlinear processor is updated
by:
H (n + 1) = H (n) + μ2e(n)Z ∗(n)S(n) (6.6.32)
where μ1 and μ2 are the iterative step-size of a single-layer neural
network and a nonlinear processor, respectively. The iterative step￾size μ1 and μ2 can become μ1+Δμ, μ2+Δμ after being controlled by
the fuzzy neural network controller. This constitutes a blind equal￾ization algorithm which uses FNN controller to control the iterative
step-size of linear filter and nonlinear memoryless processor.

the steady-state error of FNN-CNP-CMA has a drop of about 11 dB
and 8 dB in comparison with that of the CMA and the CNP-CMA,

Figure 6.31 shows the performance of the CNP-CMA and the

Figure 6.32 shows the equalization effect of the CNP-CMA and the
FNN-CNP-CMA for (4 + 12 + 20 + 28)-APSK signals. It can be seen
from the two figures that the output constellations of the FNN-CNP￾CMA are clearer and more compact than those of the CMA and the
CNP-CMA, its eye opening is clearer than that of the CMA and the
CNP-CMA, and the phase shift is effectively overcome. The output
signals of the equalizer are closer to the transmitted signals, so the
equalization performance of the FNN-CNP-CMA outperforms that
of the CNP-CMA.June 4, 2022 13:30 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch06 page 372

Satellite and Molecular MIMO
Channel Markov Chain Model
Based on Machine Learning
Summary
This chapter takes multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) sys￾tem as the research object. Based on the analysis of single input single
output (SISO) channel model characteristics, MIMO channel enhanced
two-state Markov chain model and improved enhanced two-state Markov
chain model modeling and test analysis method are presented. Aiming at
the land mobile satellite (LMS) network as an important part of the
future mobile network and broadcasting systems, a simple empirical–
stochastic dual-circular polarization LMS-MIMO narrowband channel
model was proposed and verified. Aiming at the low transmission rate of
molecular communication, an efficient modeling and simulation method
of molecular MIMO channel based on machine learning was analyzed by
using molecular MIMO technology and machine learning method.
7.1 Single Input Single Output (SISO) and Multiple
Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) Channel
Enhanced Two-State Markov Chain Model
The design and evaluation of the air interface for modern land mobile
satellite (LMS) systems between 1 and 4 GHz requires the use of
reference generative propagation channel models. In a sense, it can
generate baseband complex series of channel time evolution. Among
the possible generative modeling methods, the empirical stochastic
377June 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 378
378 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
model has been widely used in the past two decades. In fact, it usu￾ally requires few input parameters and reduces computation time.
For example, the SISO channel three-state Markov chain model was
used by the TM-SSP DVB group [1, 2]. In some cases, the available
input parameters were affected by measurement biases and uncer￾tainties due to the limited length of the original experimental dataset.
In recent years, the SISO channel enhanced two-state Markov chain
model [3], three-state Markov chain model, and improved enhanced
two-state Markov chain model [4–6] have been developed. Better
dynamic ranges and longer distances of the improved enhanced two￾state Markov chain model have been demonstrated by performing
L-band, S-band, and C-band experiments [4, 7]. In 2011 and 2012,
the French Space Agency (CNES) performed experiments at 2.2 GHz
and 3.8 GHz for various elevation angles, environments, and antenna
configurations. These experimental datasets have been used to verify
the improved enhanced two-state model [4, 5], the dual polarization
MIMO configurations, and the MIMO configurations extended by
SISO model [4]. In the verification, fading factor, Rice factor, level
crossing rate (LCR), and average fading were used as evaluation indi￾cators [8, 9].
7.1.1 Two improved enhanced two-state Markov
chain models
The enhanced two-state semi-Markov model described in [4, 5] is an
extension of the reference generative model for LMS propagation
channels. It concerns statistical modeling (introduction of confidence
intervals), Doppler spectrum modeling, MIMO extension, etc.
7.1.1.1 Experimental datasets
The Auch 2012 dataset includes SISO, single input multiple output
(SIMO), and MIMO experimental data collected at 2.2 and 3.8 GHz
at various conditions:
(1) Elevation angles: A helicopter emulating a satellite at 20◦, 30◦,
45◦, 60◦, and 70◦.
(2) Environments: small village, woodland, suburban, urban, resi￾dential areas, commercial districts, and industrial area.June 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 379

configurations).
7.1.1.2 SISO channel two-state semi-Markov input parameters
The input parameters of the SISO enhanced two-state semi-Markov
model (see [4]) are described in Table 7.1June 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 380

inferred in suburban and wooded environments at 30◦ and 60◦ ele￾vation angles.
7.1.1.3 Confidence intervals
Since the input parameters for the enhanced two-state semi-Markov
chain model are obtained from experimental statistics, they can be
affected by statistical uncertainties. In particular, the model relies
on the following assumptions:
(1) Good- and bad-state durations belong to a log-normal
distribution.
(2) Average direct path amplitude in good and bad states belongs
to a Gaussian distribution.June 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 381

Figure 7.2 State duration distributions and minimum state length (top: good,
bottom: bad).
In order to avoid the extreme instantaneous state durations and
the mean direct path amplitude values far from the experimental
values, the confidence intervals of the model have been investigated,
and the following conditions are introduced in the model:
(1) State duration: the state duration is no lower than the minimum
measurement state duration.
(2) Mean direct path amplitude: the optimum confidence intervals
are 80% and 90% for the bad and good states, respectively.
Figure 7.2 shows the relationship between the cumulative distri￾bution function (CDF) and the duration of the good and bad states,
and Figure 7.3 shows the relationship between the CDF and the
channel direct path for the example of suburban environment at 60◦
elevation angle at 2.2 GHz.
7.1.1.4 Doppler spectrum
Few results in the existing literatures can describe the realistic
Doppler spectrum of LMSs. From a conservative perspective, the
classic Jakes spectrum is widely used, though it relies on theoretical
assumptions suitable for terrestrial links only. Butterworth-shaped
filters are also commonly used. An empirical parameterization of such
a Doppler spectrum is provided in [3]:June 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 382

(1) maximum ripple of 3 dBs up to 0.9 × vM /λ(vM is the mobile
speed);
(2) attenuation of 100 dBs at 3 × vM/λ.
In [4], an approach based on a sum-of-sinusoids (SoS) method is
proposed depending on two parameters (Table 7.2):
(1) K0: restriction parameter of the classical spectrum to its lowest
frequency components;
(2) χ: multiplicative parameter of the maximum Doppler frequency.
In this section, a non-analytical method based on experimental
LCR statistics is proposed to derive the optimum input parameters
for the SoS model. This indirect method is particularly convenient
for experimental datasets with the measured channel amplitude only.
In the framework of Auch 2012 post-processing, a third parameter
was added to the SoS model: αd, the Doppler shift of the direct
path normalized by the maximum Doppler frequency vM/λ. For a
non-shadowed direct path and a σ2
0 multipath power, the Doppler
spectrum is given as

Figure 7.4 gives sample comparisons of experimental and synthetic
LCR statistics obtained with both SoS and Butterworth models when

7.1.1.5 MIMO extension
A MIMO extension of the SISO semi-Markov chain model is pro￾posed in [4]. This MIMO model takes into account the correla￾tion of the direct path amplitudes experienced on co-polarized and
cross-polarized channels. For a dual-circular polarization MIMO link
within a channel state (either good or bad), the direct path amplitude

In [4,10], it is assumed that all channels are simultaneously in the
same channel state, and mRR = mLL = mco and σRR = σLL = σco.
Here, these assumptions are considered to be valid so that mco
can be randomly extracted from the (M,
)B,G Gaussian distribu￾tions. Then, σco can be solved using σco = gG,B(mco). However, [4]
does not explicitly address the way to get mLR = mRL = mcross
and σLR = σRL = σcross. In order to get a full MIMO analytical
model, a polynomial relation between mcross and mco is assumed.
From the Auch 2012 experiment datasets, the relationship between
co-polarized and cross-polarized parameters can be well established
using a second-order polynomial function:
mcross = f(mco) = f2 × m2
co + f1 × mco + f0, (7.1.3)
where σcross can be solved using σcross = gG,B(mcross). The
relationship between the co-polarized and cross-polarized mean
direct paths in the suburban environment at S-band is shown
in Figure 7.5. The blue circles represent all direct path ampli￾tude samples, whereas the red circles represent only mean valuesJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 386

7.1.2 Testing analysis
An exhaustive testing of the enhanced two-state semi-Markov model
has been performed over the whole Auch 2012 database. Three types
of experimental and synthetic statistics have been compared:
(1) Fading margin (in dB) complementary cumulative distribution
function (CCDF);
(2) Rice factor (in dB) CCDF;
(3) AFD (in m) statistics.
The fading margin and Rice factor distributions have been com￾puted for the following percentages (based on values proposed by
ITU-R Study Group 3 Databank Tables): [0.1, 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, 90,
99, 99.9]%.June 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 387
Satellite and Molecular MIMO Channel Markov Chain Model 387
The AFD has been computed for fading thresholds from −20 to
0 dB (with 1 dB steps).
The testing variable ε is the root mean square error (RMSE)
difference between fading margin values (error in dB), Rice factor
values (error in dB), and AFD values (error in m).
Sample results for suburban environment at 60◦ elevation angle
at 2.2 GHz are shown in Figures 7.6 and 7.7, where “exp”, “IC all”,
“IC loo”, and “no IC” respectively refer to experimental statistics,
and model results with the following options: all (state-duration and
C. Loo) confidence intervals, C. Loo confidence intervals only, and
no confidence intervals. Table 7.5 shows the results for the two tested
environments and elevation angles.
In the model validation, low RMSEs are observed. In addition,
for these specific cases, all confidence intervals outperformed slightly
better at 60◦ elevation and slightly worse at 30◦ elevation. This can
be explained by the fact that at higher elevation angles, few bad￾channel events have been experienced in Auch 2012. Therefore, the
experimental state duration and fading distributions in the bad state

drawing unrealistic state durations or C. Loo parameters values, and
it should be more likely to be used in the final model.
As far as the MIMO extension to the SISO model is concerned,
the performance of the fading margin statistic has been experimen￾tally verified. Figure 7.8 shows simulated (“S”) and measured (“M”)
values for co-polarized and cross-polarized channel statistics for sub￾urban environment at 60◦ elevation. For this specific case, the MIMO
model seems to reproduce the experimental fading margin statisticsJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 389

7.2 LMS-MIMO Channel Empirical–Stochastic
Markov Model
In terms of increasing capacity and diversity gains, it is beneficial
to apply MIMO techniques to LMSs [11]. In recent years, the use
of MIMO channel model in terrestrial wireless systems including
the next-generation wireless networks, IEEE 802.11n [12] as well as
wide area networks, IEEE 802.16m [13] and long-term evolution of
third-generation mobile (3GPP LTE) [14] has become widespread.
Recently, the use of MIMO for LMS has gained interest with regards
to the satellite based on digital video broadcasting standards DVB￾SH and DVB-NGH [15]. However, it is necessary to establish a suit￾able and simple channel model of the radio wireless environment
before the LMS-MIMO systems are widely used. This section defines
an empirical–stochastic channel model for such use.
As a typical LMS channel model, as well as the model discussed
in this section, large-scale fading includes Markov chains to representJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 390
390 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
the “on/off” nature of the channel and filtered log-normal simulation
to represent the shadowing effects, and Rician simulation to represent
the small-scale fading effects [16]. However, this model improves the
capabilities to the MIMO case, where its stochastic properties are
derived from an S-band tree-lined road measurement campaign using
dual-circular polarizations at low elevations. In addition, this model
is in particular compared to existing models to date [17] considers the
interdependence of small-scale fading. Further, the most appropriate
means to accommodate this interdependence is to use a Rician fading
model, where the co-polar and cross-polar components are suitably
correlated.
This section first describes the typical factors unique to a dual￾circular polarization LMS-MIMO channel modeling [18], including
the need for a four-state Markov chain to form simultaneous dual
polar shadowing models as well as small-scale fading models. Sec￾ond, the Markov chain behavior in the LMS-MIMO channel is veri￾fied. A step-by-step guide is then provided to generate the proposed
empirical–stochastic model informed by measurement data. Finally,
validation tests are carried out to clarify the application of this model
in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) regions.
7.2.1 LMS-MIMO channel model
The LMS-MIMO channel model is a 2×2 MIMO system, wherein the
two antennas at each end are dual-circular polarized antennas with
right-hand and left-hand circular polarizations (RHCP and LHCP),
as illustrated in Figure 7.9, which is suitable for the L-band and
S-band frequency ranges, so that the ionospheric and tropospheric
effects are negligible. In the ionosphere, the largest impact would be
the Faraday rotation, which would be overcome using circular polar￾ization. If the effects of the ionosphere and troposphere could be
ignored, the main factor affecting the satellite channel MIMO model
would be the multipath effects caused by local scattering near to
the mobile. The scattering of this region will create some depolar￾ization from RHCP to LHCP and from LHCP to RHCP, which are
represented in a 2 × 2 MIMO channel matrix H , where there are
two co-polar (RHCP to RHCP and LCHP to LHCP) and two cross￾polar circularly polarized channels (RHCP to LHCP and LCHP to
RHCP). These four channels can be conveniently distinguished byJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 391

. (7.2.1)
Accordingly, the output vector received at the mobile y(t) relates to
the input vector x(t) by the following equation:
y(t) = H (t)x(t) + w(t), (7.2.2)
where w(t) is a vector to represent additive white Gaussian noise at
the receiver. Therefore, it is meaningful to model the channel state at
time t, H (t). The simplest method to model the LMS–MIMO channel
is to use a stochastic process, which will define the distribution of
the channel states (or first-order statistics), but it is also necessary
to define how the channel evolves by considering what is known as
the second-order statistics.
For satellite MIMO, it is best to break the channel H into three
components:
(i) Free space path loss: This is the well-known Friis formula [15].
In order to analyze the channel conveniently and consider it to
be an offset, it must be normalized.
(ii) Shadowing or large-scale fading: When the mobile station is on
the ground, it may either have a direct LOS link to the satel￾lite or there may be a building, tree, or other large scatter￾ing objects blocking the direct path. Therefore, the mobile is
within the shadow of the scatterer and will be subject to extraJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 392

path loss. In the case of the satellite communications, the mobile
is constantly moving in and out of the shadow area, as illustrated
in Figure 7.10. Here, the mobile is a vehicle moving along the
road; it will enter regions between scatterers on its left-hand side
where it will have an LOS link with the satellite. Therefore, the
statistical modeling of both heavy and light shadowing scenes
is required. Further, it is necessary to use the Markov chain for
modeling when the mobile is switching between heavy and light
shadowing [19].
(iii) Small-scale fading: There are several scattering objects in the
local area around the mobile, which will produce reflection,
refraction, and diffraction signals to the input. These reflections,
refractions, and diffractions change as the mobile moves. There￾fore, the received signal is constantly changing. In some cases,
the reflected signals will add up constructively in phase, while
in other cases, they will add up destructively out of phase and
the received signal will go into a deep fade.
Therefore, it is necessary to separately model the small-scale and
large-scale fading channels as it changes over time and with move￾ment of the mobile.
For LMS-MIMO systems, many factors, which are not considered
in the existing LMS channel modeling, are considered as follows:
(1) MIMO branches are in a circular polarization domain rather than
spatial domain. Therefore, channel multiplexing occurs in this
domain, which will bring different eigenvalues to the eigenvalue
decomposition of the channel. Therefore, it is necessary for the
traditional channel with different eigenvalues to be separately
modeled [20].June 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 393
Satellite and Molecular MIMO Channel Markov Chain Model 393
(2) When switching from heavy to light shadowing, the large-scale
fading changes constantly. This produces different characteristics
for the co-polar and cross-polar channel branches, and likewise
should be modeled to be consistent with simultaneous measure￾ments of these channels. In addition, the shadowing character￾istics of the two polarizations should be compared in order to
maintain their interdependence.
(3) In the small-scale fading channel, especially when there is an LOS
link, each of the four MIMO paths is not necessarily independent.
Therefore, in such circumstances, the interdependence must be
reasonably modeled so that the model and the real measured
data have comparable eigen decomposition.
Before developing the models, it is necessary to identify the
Markov chain, polarization, and interdependence characteristics from
real measurement data. After describing the measurements, the
methods for modeling the large-scale fading channels, Markov chain
models, and small-scale fading channels must be analyzed.
7.2.2 Measurement setup
Extensive measurements were carried out on the edge of the town of
Guildford, UK, where dense forests in the suburbs/rural areas of the
region are suitable for LMS-MIMO channel measurements. An arti￾ficial terrestrially based platform (acting as a satellite) was placed
on top of the hill, as illustrated in Figure 7.11, containing directional
RHCP and LHCP antennas, spaced just under one wavelength apart.
Each antenna had a gain of 12 dBi and a 3-dB beamwidth of 30◦.
The mobile vehicle contained a receiver and its roof was fitted with
omnidirectional RHCP and LHCP antennas spaced four wavelengths
apart. These two antennas had a beamwidth of 70◦ in elevation. As
the mobile end moves along a tree-lined road, the satellite elevation
angle ranged from 7◦ to 18◦. Although many operational satellite
elevations exceed these, some geostationary and low-Earth orbiting
mobile satellite services are required to work at low elevations. There￾fore, the presented experiment regards these as the worst cases, where
such elevations enable the highest degrees of multipath. The Rice fac￾tor variation and channel correlation defined by the Rice distribution
provide a usefully wide range of empirical results.June 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 394
394 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
Figure 7.11 Measurement setup of artificial platform.
A wideband MIMO channel sounder was configured for a carrier
frequency of 2.45 GHz and a bandwidth of 200 MHz. Each MIMO
channel was obtained sequentially by using fast switching at a rate of
152.7 Hz, which is over twice the maximum Doppler shift of 73 Hz for
the vehicle speed, thus meeting Nyquist criteria. It is assumed that
the experiment was carried out on a tree-lined road with few moving
vehicles. From the data, suitable results were found whereby the
channel could be captured within the channel sounder’s sensitivity
giving a SNR that enabled the multipath to be measured without
error due to receiver noise. The interference contained in the data
from the local wireless area networks that had to be filtered out
from measurement data and replaced with interpolated data. Since
the data sampling rate was over the required Nyquist criteria, this
meant it was possible to achieve this. Figure 7.12 shows the Markov
chain behavior of the heavy and light shadowing for all four MIMO
branches using the measurement data. It can be seen from Figure 7.12
that there are different small-scale fading characteristics in heavy and
light shadowing regions, as well as Markov chain characteristics that
are related for co-polar and cross-polar channels, though they are
required to be generated separately. In the next section, how the
large-scale fading, Markov chains, and small-scale fading in three
separate steps and then integrated to form a working channel matrix
are explained in detail.June 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 395

7.2.3 Model generation
Step 1: Generate large-scale fading for heavy and light shadowing.
For 2 × 2 MIMO systems, four simultaneous models of heavy
shadowing that vary over distance (i.e., in the NLOS region) are
required to produce vector sheavy and four simultaneous models of
light shadowing (i.e., in the LOS region) are required to produce vec￾tor slight, in dB by using zero-mean, unit-standard-deviation Gaus￾sian random noise signals. In order to make the two sets of four
shadowing models be interdependent, a 4 × 4 correlation matrix
for large-scale fading, C large, is then applied to the heavy and
light shadowing as analysis of measurement data has shown that
both shadowing cases follow the Gaussian distribution. The inter￾dependence between the four MIMO branches is accommodated so
that the correlated shadowing sheavy|c and slight|c is expressed as
follows:
sheavy|c = C 1

where C large|RR,LL denotes the correlation of the shadowing between

An appropriate set of values taken from the measurement data

⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠ . (7.2.5)
Due to the close proximity of the two transmit antennas and the
two receive antennas, the correlation values are high, and other mea￾surements have shown that high correlation is maintained in different
channel scenarios. Using these correlations, eight time-synchronized
simulations are created that are defined by the following process to
form the second-order statistics [21]:
sheavy|cf(n) = sheavy|c(n) + e
− vmΔt
rc sheavy|cf(n − 1),
slight|cf(n) = slight|c(n) + e
− vmΔt
rc slight|cf(n − 1), (7.2.6)
where the time variation is determined by a coherence distance, rc,
for a given mobile speed, vm, with sample time, Δt, and sheavy|c and
slight|c are the correlated Gaussian distributed random variables with
zero mean and unit standard deviation. Measurements have shown
rc to be 25 m on average for a tree-lined road environment. The
range of rc values recorded spanned from 23 m through to 29 m.
It is assumed in this case that each sample, n, is taken for every
meter. The shadowing then requires normalization, where a set of
standard deviations to the shadowing represented by vectors σheavyJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 397

and σlight and mean values, represented by vectors μheavy and μlight,
all in dB, are applied, where ◦ denotes element-wise multiplication
and the normalized, filtered, and correlated shadowing, sheavy|cfn and

derived generically from all measurement data taken as the highest
and lowest values. Finally, the data must be reshaped to create two

Step 2: Generate Markov chain.
After the data for heavy and light shadowing sequences are gener￾ated, the conversion between the heavy and light shadowing regions
for co-polar and the cross-polar channels can be described by the
Markov chain [17]. As shown in Figure 7.10, this sharp transition
occurs as the mobile moves past buildings and can be modeled appro￾priately. Therefore, if two polarizations are considered, there are four
possible Markov states, as shown in Figure 7.13. It is assumed that
the behavior is the same whichever of RHCP or LHCP is being trans￾mitted. Once the polarization is defined at the transmit end, these
four possible states therefore consider whether the co-polar or cross￾polar channel at the receiving end are both in a heavy or light state
or in opposite states, as can happen in certain instances. There are
16 possible state transitions for the four possible states, as shown by
the arrows. By analyzing the Markov chain properties of all measured
samples, the Markov chain statistics extracted from the measured
data (once a threshold is selected for heavy and light shadowing in
the measured data) are shown in Table 7.7. The Markov chain derived
from the measurement data using the chosen threshold was analysed
to ensure that where state transitions did occur, they were true cases
of real transitions. There can be cases with extreme light probabil￾ity, where a heavy state shadowing falls below the threshold while
also a light state threshold rises above the threshold. The Markov
chain test eliminated these possible situations. The columns of state
transition represent the probability of one state moving to another

state listed in the right-hand column, whereas each row represents
the probability of moving to the state shown on the right-hand col￾umn from the previous state shown on the bottom row. Thus, the
top right-hand state transition of 0.1037 is the probability of mov￾ing from the state “CP heavy, XP heavy” to “CP light, XP light”,
where CP is a co-polar channel and XP is a cross-polar channel. In
most cases, both CP and XP are in a heavy-shadowing state, which
reflects the fact that the measurement environment is a road lined
with houses and trees with foliage, thus providing dense multipath
and the satellite at a light elevation. By applying the Markov chain
analysis, sampled every meter, to the large-scale shadowing, a 2 × 2
channel matrix, H large can be finally created.
After generating the Markov chain, the data must be up-sampled
to match small-scale fading that is generated next. Up-sampling is
necessary because the rate of change of the large-scale fading is quite
light compared to that of the small-scale fading. Therefore, in the
first case, such a large sampling size (based on the size of rc) is not
required. However, for the large-scale fading to be integrated with
the small-scale fading at a later stage, the large-scale fading must
match the sampling rate for the small-scale fading.
Step 3: Generate small-scale fast fading.
In this case, the small-scale fading is modeled by a Rice distribution,
where the light shadowing region will have a higher Rice factor than
that of the heavy shadowing region, which is subject to denser mul￾tipath. The usage of values of Rice factors based on measurements
is shown in Table 7.8. Using the Rician factors [21], Rician fading
with appropriate second-order statistics can be generated for each
MIMO branch by using a ring scatterer model (of course, small-scaleJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 400

fading can also be generated by Doppler filtering and autocorrela￾tion matrices [22]). For each sample n, the small-scale fading ele￾ments, denoted by subscripts xx of H small, are derived in this case as
follows:
hsmallxx(n) =
√kxxe
j n2πfm Nf + NS
i=1 Mnorme
j(
2πn sin φi Nf
+θi)
√kxx + 1 , (7.2.8)
where Nf is the sampling factor equal to the sampling frequency
divided by the maximum Doppler shift, fm, due to mobile move￾ment. The Rayleigh (or scattered) part of the small-scale fading is
normalized by Mnorm so that its mean is unity. The components of
the Rayleigh part will arrive at angle φi and have a random phase θi.
The four hsmallxx elements are arranged into the 2×2 matrix H small.
In the heavy shadowing regions, there is generally an NLOS condi￾tion and the Rice factor is low. In the case of the LMS, the scattering
rich environment local to the mobile terminal provides low correla￾tion between the antenna branches, while at the satellite, there are
directional antennas with highly orthogonal circular polarizations,
thus their correlation is also low. Therefore, at each end, the corre￾lation is independent and remains low in an NLOS scenario, which
therefore justifies that the channel is separable in order to allow the
well-known Kronecker model to be applied [23] to model the corre￾lated small-scale fading, as follows:
vec(H small|c) = R1
2
small|cvec(H small|NLOS), (7.2.9)
where vec is the vectorize function. The small-scale fading correlation
matrix is written as
Rsmall =

Satellite and Molecular MIMO Channel Markov Chain Model 401
In the case where there is light shadowing and an LOS, the channel
cannot be considered a separable, and Kronecker’s assumption does
not hold. Therefore, the Kronecker model has been extended here
such that it is suited to a 2 × 2 satellite MIMO system in an LOS
environment with dual-circular polarization, which enables polariza￾tion multiplexing.
First, the co-polar correlation matrix RCP is written as
RCP =
 1 r∗
CP
rCP 1

, (7.2.11)
where rCP is the correlation between hRR and hRR. The phase infor￾mation in the matrix is not necessary when generating a model.
Second, RXP is also defined in a similar way. rXP is the correlation
between hLR and hLL.
Again, the phase information is not essential. In terms of the gain
patterns and polarization purity, the two antennas at the transmit
end have similar characteristics. Although the transmit antenna does
not have to be the same as the receive end, it must be the same at
the receiving end. The 2 × 2 correlation matrix for the cross-polar is
defined as follows:
RCP =
 1 r∗
XP
rXP 1

. (7.2.12)
The two matrices in Equations (7.2.11) and (7.2.12) will affect the
orthogonality of the right-hand and left-hand polarizations, which
will be key to the MIMO channel. A 1 × 2 co-polarized channel
vector hCP|small can be obtained by the Rice factor determined by
Equation (7.2.7), and then the two co-polarizations are correlated to
obtain hCP|small|C as follows:
hCP|small|C = R1
2
CPhCP|small. (7.2.13)
Likewise, for the cross-polarizations, hCP|small|C is given as follows:
hXP|small|C = R1
2
XPhXP|small. (7.2.14)
The four elements once generated can easily be inserted into a
2×2 matrix to generate the small-scale fading, H small. After applyingJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 402
402 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
the correlation, it is necessary to re-normalize the mean values of all
four MIMO branches. For the cross-polar components, hsmallLR and
hsmallRL, the mean values must also be divided by the square root of
the cross-polar ratio, √
XPD. The XPD is defined as the ratio of the
mean co-polar power to the mean cross-polar power. It is assumed
that XPD is the same whether the co-polar component is left-hand
or right-hand circularly polarized. The measured data shows that
for co-polarization, the Rice factor ranges from 0 to 10. The cross￾polar Rice factors were also found to be wide ranging, though as a
rule they are always less than the co-polar Rice factor for a set of
samples, thus any Rice factors can be selected for a model that adhere
to the rule, though corresponding XPD and correlations have to be
used alongside given Rice factors. Tables 7.8 and 7.9 give suitable
corresponding values of correlation and XPD, respectively, based on
the analysis of the measured data. In the case of a high Rice factor,
the co-polar correlation is inherently high, while for a low Rice factor,
the correlation is lower and has a larger variance. For a high Rice
factor, XPD can be as high as 15 dB, but on average, it is closer to
10 dB. For lower Ricean factor, where scattering results in significant
de-polarization, the average XPD is closer to 0 dB.
Step 4: Integrate steps 1, 2, and 3.
After the large and small scales of fading channels are created, they
can be simply multiplied together to form the final channel model
such that
H = H large ◦ H small, (7.2.15)
where ◦ denotes an element-wise multiplication of the two matrices.
It should be noted that the resultant large-scale fading H large is
already normalized to the bulk mean free space path loss and any

other losses in the ionosphere or troposphere. However, the resultant
small-scale fading H small must be normalized to unit mean power.
7.2.4 LMS-MIMO channel model validation
of small-scale fading
An important validation for the MIMO channel model is to ensure
that the eigenvalue cumulative distributions produced by the model
are in good agreement with the measured data. This will not only
ensure that the first- and second-order statistics of the physical chan￾nel are suitably modeled but also that the interdependence between
them is suitably accounted for to demonstrate the diversity and mul￾tiplexing capabilities of the model. In order to demonstrate the val￾idation of the model, two LOS and NLOS cases were chosen, which
had values of Rice factor, XPD, and correlation shown in Table 7.10.
The Rice factor values are in linear form. The following three sec￾tions compare the first-order, second-order, and eigen analysis as a
validation of the model proposed using appropriate sections of the
measurement data. The sampling rate of the measured data for test￾ing model is more than twice the maximum Doppler shift frequency
to meet the Nyquist criterion.
7.2.4.1 First-order statistics
Figures 7.14 and 7.15 illustrate the cumulative distribution of the
small-scale fading for all four branches of the NLOS and LOS regions.
In both cases, there is good agreement between the measurement
data and model, where in the LOS scenario, a wider gap can be iden￾tified between co-polar and cross-polar branches. It is interesting to
note that compared with RHCP, the mean value of the cross-polar
component for LHCP transmission is shifted by over 6 dB, where
the multipath was found to combine better constructively within the

7.2.4.2 Second-order statistics
Figure 7.16 shows the Doppler spread in both left-hand to left-hand
hLL and right-hand to right-hand hRR polarized cases, where the
polarization has little difference in LOS or NLOS. The Doppler
spread shown verifies the suitability of the Rician distribution for
small-scale modeling based on a classical bath tub model with the
addition of a delta function for the Rice component [16]. A high
Rice component is identified in Figure 7.16 for LOS, while the NLOS
case still has a small Rice component due to the non-uniform angle
of arrival. Figure 7.17 shows further validation of the second-order
statistic, which shows a good agreement between LCR and AFD
when comparing the measured and modeled narrowband data. Free
space loss and the maximum Doppler frequency shown in Figure 7.17
are labeled as FSL and fm, respectively.

Figure 7.18 presents results of the eigen analysis of the model and
measurement data as well as the modeled data for the NLOS case.
Figure 7.18 shows that the modeled and measured data have good
consistency, which verifies that the Kronecker model method is suit￾able for the NLOS case. In the graph, the notation sn denotes an
eigenvalue, where n is 1 or 2 for a 2 × 2 MIMO system.

On the other hand, Figure 7.19 compares measured and modeled
eigenvalues in the LOS case. Compared with the NLOS case, because
the eigenvalue distribution is closer, the LOS channel has rich polar￾ization multiplexing rather than diversity, which may be caused by
less scatterers. Although the experimental results are consistent, it
should be noted that in this validation, the phase information was
applied in the correlation matrix. Were the phase information not
applied, the second eigenvalue would marginally change its gradient,
moving away from the measured data by less than 2 dB. Since the
effect of this deviation on the modeling channel capacity is negligible,
it is not important to use the phase information. A similar scenario
occurs when modeling other LOS regions.
Based on the switching between heavy and light shadowing
regions with different multipath conditions, a simple empirical–
stochastic model for the dual-circular polar 2×2 LMS-MIMO channel
has been presented in this section, along with results to validate the
model at low elevation. The validation of the model at such elevations
will also be suited to higher elevation angles, where the multipath is
reduced and the opportunity to implement polarization multiplexing
is increased. It is well known that the Kronecker model is suitable for
the NLOS case, and the model presented in this section is suitable forJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 407

7.3 Molecular MIMO Channel Model
Based on Machine Learning
Molecular communication (MC) is quite different from traditional
electromagnetic wave communication in that it conveys information
by utilizing molecules. Such small-scale communication is a chal￾lenging task [24]. Recently, researchers have been paying attention
to MC because it has the potential for enabling complex applications
of nanotechnology that requires collaboration of very small entities.
For example, MC can be applied in the nanorobots’ communication
and health monitoring issues [24–26].
MC has three advantages in nanoscale communication compared
to traditional electromagnetic wave communication. First, low energy
consumption is one of the important requirements for nanoscale com￾munication, and MC shows better performance (in terms of energy
consumption) than traditional methods. Second, MC can reduce the
size of the antenna, which is validated by many examples in nature.
Finally, as long as harmless molecules are used, the MC in vivo
system has greater biocompatibility characteristics than traditional
communication.
In a diffusion-based MC, the received signal is determined by the
received molecules, and the information particles move via a diffu￾sion process, which shows random movement. One of the main chal￾lenges in MC is to develop valid models for representing received sig￾nals in different environments. Studies on MC, such as modulation,
detection, and receiver design, utilize channel models that rely on
the environmental conditions [28–32]. Previous studies have mostly
focused on the molecular SISO communication systems, whereas
few studies have focused on molecular MIMO communication sys￾tems. In [33], the authors proposed an analytical channel model for
absorbing receivers in a one-dimensional environment. In [34], the
authors enhanced the channel model by considering the flow effects.
In [35], the authors proposed a theoretical molecular channel model
for a three-dimensional (3-D) environment. The model is based on
a point transmitter and an absorbing spherical receiver, where the
expected cumulative number of received molecules is formulated withJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 409
Satellite and Molecular MIMO Channel Markov Chain Model 409
respect to time. In [36], the channel model described in [35] has been
enhanced by adding the receptor effect. When a molecular MIMO
channel with two absorbing antennas is considered, analytical deriva￾tion becomes difficult to handle. Therefore, semi-analytical methods
are used in which channel taps are taken from the simulations and
plugged into the analysis derivations. In [37], the authors presented
a molecular MIMO channel model using simulation data. A known
challenge is to calculate an accurate channel model for molecular
MIMO. Therefore, a more practical method is needed to acquire
channel taps without simulations.
Modeling molecular MIMO channels with absorbing receiver
antennas remains an open issue. In this section, a machine learn￾ing approach is used to model a 2×2 molecular MIMO channel with
point transmitter antennas and absorbing receiver antennas. Artifi￾cial neural network (ANN)-based channel modeling techniques are
used to develop two different techniques that utilize the ANN-based
one-machine and two-machines techniques. The differences between
the two is studied here. Then, the model of the proposed technique
is used to calculate the bit error rate (BER) [38].
7.3.1 System model
Consider a 2×2 molecular MIMO system, as depicted in Figure 7.20.
It shows two point transmitters and two spherical receivers connected
to a cuboid body. In this model, the antennas are assumed to be
perfectly aligned. The transmitter antennas are separated by a dis￾tance h, which also holds for the receiver antennas. The radius of a
spherical receiver antenna is denoted as R, and the distance between
corresponding transmitter and receiver antennas is denoted by d.
When molecules are emitted from the point transmitter anten￾nas, they propagate by the diffusion process in the 3-D environment.
The diffusion process is characterized by the diffusion coefficient D.
The receiver antennas absorb molecules that impinge on the surface
of the receiver surface, and each receiver antenna calculates the num￾ber of received molecules. The absorbed molecules are counted only
once (i.e., the molecule contributes to the molecular signal only once).
Here, assume that if a molecule hits the cuboid body, the molecule
is reflected to the medium.
In this section, a molecular MIMO channel model based on the
SISO channel model is developed. In [35], the expectation of theJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 410

SISO channel response is given and analyzed from the perspective of

, (7.3.1)
where d and erfc(·) represent the distance and the complementary
error function, respectively. When there is only one spherical receiver,
there is a circular symmetry, all the points at the same radius are
equivalent and the solution for the system of differential equations
is enabled. However, this model cannot define the molecular MIMO
channel accurately. Therefore, the above SISO channel model with
additional adjustment parameters for each receiver antenna may be
utilized.
7.3.2 Molecular MIMO channel model
Finding model parameters for a 2 × 2 molecular MIMO channel
defines all the required data for evaluating the channel impulse
response. In this communication system, there are four emission
scenarios: only either transmitter 1 (Tx1) or 2 (Tx2) emits, two
transmitters emit simultaneously, and none of them emit molecules.
Due to the rectangular symmetry of the topology, the molecular
MIMO channel by considering the emission of a single emitter canJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 411
Satellite and Molecular MIMO Channel Markov Chain Model 411
be modeled. In this case, all four cases can be formulated by using
the channel response of a single emitter case. Therefore, by using a
molecular MIMO communication simulator, the data for the channel
responses of receivers 1 (Rx1) and 2 (Rx2) are collected when a single
antenna emitted molecules.
The proposed technique involves two processes: fitting the channel
model parameters and learning the input–output dataset patterns by
ANNs. After the training phase, the trained ANN can effectively pre￾dict channel model parameters without simulation. A representative
scheme of the proposed technique is depicted in Figure 7.21.
7.3.2.1 Channel model and fitting
In this section, two different model functions are used to fit the sim￾ulation data. Because Rx1’s and Rx2’s responses exhibit different
schemes due to the distance difference, the corresponding distances
in model functions are used. When considering the case that only the
Tx1 emits molecules for analyzing the cumulative channel functions
at Rx1 (i.e., F11(·)) and Rx2 (i.e., F21(·)), the model function with
three scaling factors is given as follows:

where b4, b5, and b6 represent the model-fitting parameters.
To find the model parameters, the nonlinear least squares curve￾fitting technique is adopted. Assuming that there are N observations
during the simulation, the parameter estimation problem with m
parameters is given as follows:

where S3D
ij (t) corresponds to the mean simulation data that represent
the ratio of hitting molecules until time t. Note that for each receiver,
the corresponding model function from Equations (7.3.2) or (7.3.3)
may be used.
The output of the curve-fitting process consists of model parame￾ters. Therefore, the model parameters for each simulation case, which
form the dataset of the next process, are obtained. This dataset struc￾ture is shown in Figure 7.21 (i.e., the model parameters in the fitting
dataset blocks).
7.3.2.2 Training ANN
The channel response in the diffusion-based 2 × 2 molecular MIMO
communication system with two point transmitters and two spherical
receivers is modeled by using machine learning techniques. ANN, one
of the popular machine learning technologies, has simple, neuron￾like nodes with thresholds and connections with weights. Basically,
the thresholds and weights are adjusted by backpropagation (which
evaluates the gradient and takes a step accordingly to minimize the
loss function) for learning input–output pattern.
The dataset is divided into two disjointed subsets, namely training
(TDS) and validation (VDS) datasets. The TDS is used for trainingJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 413
Satellite and Molecular MIMO Channel Markov Chain Model 413
the ANN to obtain the desired output for a given input. For train￾ing the ANN, the backpropagation with Bayesian regularization is
used to update the weights and bias values according to Levenberg–
Marquardt optimization. Bayesian regularization helps to minimize
a combination of squared errors and weights together. Therefore, it
helps to determine the ANN parameters that generalize the pattern
in the input–output pairs without overlearning. After the learning
phase, the trained ANN is used to estimate the channel parameters
for different cases. Note that the trained ANN does not require any
simulation data, i.e., the required inputs are the system parameters,
namely d, h, R, and D.
Furthermore, in order to consider the effect of the number of
ANNs for the modeling purpose, a machine learning technique is
adopted. There are two different methods: one machine and two
machines (Figure 7.21). First, the input parameters of d, h, R, and
D are used to train a single ANN, and all the output parameters
are regarded as model parameters (i.e., b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6). Second,
for two ANNs, the parameters of d, h, R, and D in a similar way
are used as inputs but the output parameters are separated. The
first ANN’s output parameters are b1, b2, b3 and the second ANN’s
are b4, b5, b6. The first ANN predicts the channel model parameters
of Rx1, which is aligned with the emitting transmitter, and the sec￾ond ANN predicts the channel model parameters of Rx2. For both
techniques, it is necessary to use one fully connected hidden layer
approach while keeping the total number of nodes same, i.e., one￾machine technique’s ANN consists of 30 nodes, so each ANN of the
two-machines technique uses 15 nodes.
7.3.2.3 Using ANN output for theoretical BER evaluation
For a case study, the ANN results are used to evaluate the BER of a
selected case. In the molecular MIMO communication system, infor￾mation is transmitted using a sequence of symbols that are spread
over sequential time slots (ts). Binary concentration shift keying
(BCSK) modulation at each antenna is utilized, i.e., N molecules are
emitted for a bit-1 and no emission is done for a bit-0 [40–42]. Demod￾ulation takes place at the end of each symbol slot, and the BCSK
symbols are demodulated by thresholding the number of received
molecules at Rx1 (NRx1 ) and Rx2 (NRx2 ) in a given symbol slot.
The demodulated symbol at the mth symbol slot of Rxi is denotedJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 414
414 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations
by sRxi m . In MC, the number of received molecules is highly affected
by previous emissions, which leads to inter-symbol interference (ISI).
For tractability, a finite number of symbol slots for ISI is considered
and the insignificant part of ISI is ignored. With a given ISI window
(η), the number of received molecules at the mth symbol slot is the
sum of binomial-distributed random variables, where each summand
represents the number of hitting molecules due to a previous emis￾sion. For tractability, by using Gaussian approximation for binomial
random variables and considering an ISI window of η, the general
case is as follows:
NRxi (m) ∼ N (mG, σ2),

G, the number of received
molecules for Rxi at the mth symbol slot, the bit value for Txi to
send at the kth symbol slot, and the probability of hitting to Rxi
for the molecules emitted from Txj at the kth following symbol slot,
respectively. Note that Fij(0) corresponds to the hitting probability
at the current symbol slot. By using the output of the ANN tech￾nique, the evaluation of BER analytically can be modeled as follows:

7.3.3 Results and analysis
Common system parameters for simulations, TDS, and VDS are pre￾sented in Table 7.11. From the given datasets, each of the VDS and
TDS have 5 × 3 × 2 × 3 = 90 different cases, making a total of 180
cases. Each simulation case is replicated 500 times to estimate the
mean channel model.
7.3.3.1 Received signal analysis
In Figures 7.22 and 7.23, the received signals are plotted for simula￾tion data, curve-fitting, and ANN (one-machine and two-machines)
techniques. Note that the ANN technique requires no simulation data
while the curve-fitting method does. After training an ANN, chan￾nel model parameters for VDS by giving only the system parameters
as input were estimated. It can be seen from Figures 7.22 and 7.23
that the trained ANN estimates the channel model parameters effec￾tively for d = 2 μm and d = 8 μm cases. It can be found that the
trained ANNs perform better at longer distances, a finding that will
be detailed and quantified in the following section.

channel response was evaluated. Tables 7.12 and 7.13 show the
following: (1) The one-machine method learns the channel model
parameters slightly better than the two-machines method. (2) The
proposed techniques perform better when increasing the distance.
For the short distances, the compensation parameters cannot work
effectively enough to model the molecular MIMO channel param￾eters. The gain of the proposed technique is higher for the longerJune 4, 2022 13:31 Nonlinear Channel Models and Their Simulations 9in x 6in b4530-ch07 page 418

distances both in terms of RMSE (i.e., modeling performance) and
the run time (simulations for the longer distances require much more
run time).
In order to analyze the dataset requirements of the proposed
methods, only half of the TDS was used to train (data for the
half TDS was removed randomly). The different performance for
ANNs was observed according to the amount of input data. The
two-machines technique showed a better performance when the half
of the TDS for the training phase (Table 7.13) is used. Hence, more
training data was needed to make the one-machine technique perform
better at modeling the channel.
7.3.3.3 Theoretical BER analysis
As a case study, the channel model from ANN was considered and
the BER was evaluated by using Equation (7.3.6). To validate the
proposed model, simulations with the given parameters were carried
out and the empirical BER results were obtained. Simulations were
replicated with consecutive 106 bits. It can be seen from Figure 7.24
that the simulation and model results are remarkably close for the
selected case from VDS. In the zoomed inset plot, there is a small
deviation from the simulation result.
