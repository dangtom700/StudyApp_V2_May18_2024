Preface
Poly-substituted arenes, heteroarenes, and alkenes are commonly found in bioactive
compounds and organic materials. Devising efficient methods for constructing
these structural motifs has been of long-standing interest in the synthetic commu￾nity. While numerous arene-functionalization and alkene-synthesis approaches
exist, those that can simultaneously introduce two or more different functional
groups to arenes or alkenes in a regio- and site-selective manner are still rare.
For example, the use of aryne chemistry for arene functionalization is generally
constrained by substrate specificity and/or complexed by strongly basic conditions;
the strategy of preparing tri- or tetra-substituted alkenes from internal alkynes often
suffers from poor regioselectivity control and limits to linear substrates. So, does an
alternative strategy allowing general, rapid, site-selective functionalizations of arenes,
heteroarenes, and alkenes exist? I trust you can find answers in this book.
This book provides a comprehensive overview of the palladium/norbornene
(Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis, which represents a unique approach to enable
site-selective vicinal difunctionalization of aryl and alkenyl substrates. Through
forming the key aryl (alkenyl) norbornyl palladacycle (ANP) intermediate, the
difunctionalization is typically realized through coupling a nucleophile at the ipso
position and an electrophile at the ortho position, which represents the unique
feature of the Pd/NBE catalysis. One can imagine that numerous coupling combi￾nations and variations could stem from this distinctive reactivity mode, resulting in
enormous opportunities for developing powerful synthetic methods. For example,
using aryl halide substrates, termination with hydrogen at the ipso position can
lead to functionalization of conventionally less reactive positions. In addition,
as a multi-component reaction, the tethering of any reaction components in the
Pd/NBE catalysis can deliver interesting, polycyclic scaffolds. Moreover, the merge
of the Pd/NBE catalysis, electrophilic arene halogenation, and cross couplings
can allow access to challenging benzenoid substitution patterns. Furthermore, the
application of the ortho C—H amination to the enol system can result in carbonyl
1,2-transposition.
Since the landmark discovery of the ortho C—H alkylation by Professor Marta
Catellani in 1997, the field of the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis has evolved enor￾mously. Especially in the past decade, a number of longstanding constraints and
limitations have been overcome to enable more general and diverse transforma￾tions. New related reaction modes have also been uncovered, leading to excitingxiv Preface
applications.However, compared to the concurrently developed Buchwald−Hartwig
couplings (i.e. amination, oxygenation, etc.), the Pd/NBE catalysis has received
much less attention outside this field, particularly in the pharmaceutical industries.
One possible reason could be due to the relatively complex reaction mechanism and
catalyst system, making many people feel intimidated from trying this type of reac￾tions. Thus, one main purpose of this book is to provide readers a systematic under￾standing of the Pd/NBE catalysis, including the mechanisms, scopes, and current
limitations. It is our hope that this book will not only offer fundamental knowledge
to students or entry-level researchers in the organic synthesis field, but also provide
guidance to advance researchers about how to use this type of catalysis (e.g., how to
choose the best reaction conditions or catalyst combination) to help their research.
This book contains eight chapters, each written by leading experts in the Pd/NBE
catalysis field. It starts with the annulation chemistry by Abel-Snape and Lautens,
given the importance of diverse ring structures in organic synthesis, which also sets
the mechanistic foundation of the Pd/NBE catalysis. The following two chapters
cover the scope of the ipso and ortho functionalization by the Liang group and
my own group, respectively. Chapter 4 is centered on the asymmetric develop￾ment, contributed by Professor Gu. Then, the book shifts to the discussion of the
Pd(II)-initiated reactions by a team effort of Zhou and Yu, followed by a wonderful
review of the Pd/NBE-catalyzed heteroarene functionalization from Professor Joo.
Chapter 7 written by Professor Wu is centered on newly developed approaches
to address various constraints in the Pd/NBE catalysis. The book closes with the
summary of various applications in synthesis of complex molecules and organic
materials by Professor Wang.
Asthe editor, I am very grateful to a large number of kind and outstanding people.
First of all, I would like to thank all the chapter authors for their incredible pas￾sions and dedications. Note that they have made impressive contributions not only
to the writing of the book but also to the field of the Pd/NBE catalysis. It is certainly
my honor to work with all of them. In addition, Dr. Xin Liu is highly acknowl￾edged for his kind help in proofreading all the chapters, and his insightful inputs
are greatly appreciated. Moreover, Ms. Alia McDaniel is thanked for her dedicated
administrative assistance during this process. Needless to mention, I am indebted to
all my current and former students and postdocs who worked in the Pd/NBE catal￾ysis projects for their exceptional creativity and persistence. Special gratitude to my
former graduate student Dr. Zhe Dong—now a professor at SUSTech—who initi￾ated and popularized the Pd/NBE catalysis project in my lab. Furthermore, I have
to express my deepest appreciation to Professor Marta Catellani for her original and
inspiring seminal works of the Pd/NBE chemistry, as well as her generous support!
Finally, I would like to thank my family, especially my wife and two daughters,
for their unconditional love and support. This book would not have existed with￾out them.

The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation
Chemistry: Rapid Access to Diverse Ring Structures
Mark Lautens and Xavier Abel-Snape

1.1 Introduction
Palladium–norbornene (NBE) cooperative catalysis, commonly known as the
Catellani reaction, constitutes a general and straightforward method to sequentially
difunctionalize a haloarene at the ortho and ipso positions, with two different
reagents [1–6]. These reagents are typically opposite in reactivity, as the first
to react does so as an electrophile (E), which will functionalize the ortho site,
while the second serves as a terminating reagent, which is often a nucleophile in
character (Nu), which will add at the ipso position (Scheme 1.1). This sequence
is made possible due to a unique combination of characteristics, including NBE’s
exceptional reactivity due to the strain, the resulting rigid framework that creates
a transient directing group, and lack of accessible β-hydrogens, that prevent side
reactions.
Scheme 1.1 The general Catellani reaction.
The mechanism has been investigated in detail. Following oxidative addition into
the C—X bond, the initial arylpalladium(II) species preferentially reacts with NBE
via carbopalladation in order to release its ring strain rather than with the termi￾nating reagent (Scheme 1.2). Every Catellani reaction subsequently generates a key
intermediate, known as the arylnorbornyl palladacycle (ANP), which is typically
formed after concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) occurs at the ortho position
in the presence of a base. The electrophile is then installed via one of two possible
pathways: (i) oxidative addition to form a Pd(IV) intermediate followed by reduc￾tive elimination or (ii) dinuclear transmetalation [7–9]. Due to the steric congestion,2 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry
NBE is then extruded via β–C elimination, giving rise to a new ortho-functionalized
arylpalladium(II) species that can now react with the terminating reagent.
Scheme 1.2 The general mechanism of the Catellani reaction.
In most cases, the aryl group bears one ortho-substituent to avoid di-ortho￾functionalization with the electrophile or NBE-integrated side-products and
ultimately, a lower yield of desired product [9]. This requirement is known as the
ortho constraint. To tackle this issue, various modified NBE scaffolds have been
developed to successfully employ ortho-unsubstituted aryl halides as substrates that
give good to excellent yields [10–12].
Chapter 1 presents various cyclization methodologies harnessing Pd-NBE
cooperative catalysis. The first section describes the most common way of forming
rings, i.e. intramolecular cyclization, where two or all three out of the aryl halide,
electrophile or terminating reagent are tethered to one another. The second section
reports annulations involving sequential intermolecular ortho-functionalization1.2 Intramolecular Cyclizations 3
and ring closure steps with external reagents. Three-membered rings constitute
the focus of section three, where their innate strain turns them into valuable
electrophiles and terminating reagents upon ring opening, thereby forming
five-membered rings. Reactions where NBE and its analog norbornadiene find
themselves incorporated in the final annulated product instead of solely being
used as transient directing groups are included in section four. The final section is
comprised of reactions where the annulation step occurs after the catalytic cycle.
1.2 Intramolecular Cyclizations
1.2.1 Electrophile Tethered to Terminating Reagent
1.2.1.1 Ortho Alkylation
Ipso Heck Termination The original 1997 report by Catellani described a reaction
between an unsubstituted or para substituted aryl iodide, an alkyl halide, and a Heck
acceptor [1]. The catalyst, known as the PNP complex, was a phenyl norbornyl pal￾ladium halide dimer prepared from phenyl mercuric chloride, NBE, and palladium
chloride. In 1999, Pd(OAc)2 in DMF was shown to be a suitable combination for
reacting ortho-substituted aryl iodides [13]. In 2000, Lautens developed an annu￾lative process and reported what have become the most widely used conditions,
namely Pd(OAc)2, phosphines, acetonitrile, and cesium carbonate (Scheme 1.3). In
this example, the electrophile, i.e. the alkyl bromide, istethered to the Heck acceptor
providing access to fused ring systems [14].
Scheme 1.3 First annulative Catellani methodology.
This set of conditions paved the way for subsequent ring-forming processes,
generating a variety of benzofused carbo- and heterocycles via ortho-alkylation
and ipso-Heck termination under identical or modified conditions (Scheme 1.4)
[15–19]. Some of these examples illustrate that heterocycles are tolerated, which
was not possible until Lautens’ report in 2006 [18].
Alkyl bromides were generally preferred over the analogous iodides likely due
to potential side reactions, namely oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C(sp3)–I
bond followed by β–H elimination and reductive elimination to give the corre￾sponding olefin and HI [13]. However, the iodides were ideal electrophiles in a
β-fluoroalkylation process [20]. Alkyl tosylates were also found to be compatible
electrophiles in the Catellani reaction [21].4 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry
Scheme 1.4 Examples of ortho-alkylation/ipso-Heck-termination annulative
methodologies.
The Zhou group identified epoxides as alkylating reagents in a macrocyclization
event using the potassium salt of 5-NBE-2-carboxylic acid N1 (Scheme 1.5) [22].
Scheme 1.5 Macrocycle formation using an epoxide as an alkylating reagent.
(Homo)allylic alcohols were suitable as the Heck acceptor, furnishing the corre￾sponding carbonyl compounds via a redox-relay Heck cyclization (Scheme 1.6) [23].
Scheme 1.6 First methodology using (homo)allylic alcohols as the Heck acceptor.
Zhou was able to generate ring sizes ranging from five to seven [19, 24, 25].
Dong was also able to provide aldehyde-tethered rings using modified procedures
(Scheme 1.7) [26, 27].
Ipso C–H Arylation The first examples of annulative C–H arylation were reported
by Lautens in 2005. The use of an unfunctionalized arene offers an attractive alter￾native to cross-coupling reactions where both arenes typically need a compatible

functional group. Lautens showcased the power of C–H arylation by generating
annulated indoles (Scheme 1.8) [28].
Scheme 1.8 Synthesis of annulated indoles via ipso C–H arylation.
This concept was generalized to include the synthesis of related hetero- and
carbocycles (Scheme 1.9) [29–36].
Ipso Alkyne Insertion Following ortho-alkylation and NBE extrusion, the resulting
arylpalladium(II) species may undergo a migratory insertion relay step, followed by
subsequent annulation reactions that increase molecular complexity.
Lautens reported reactions of alkyne-substituted alkyl halides that lead to
ipso-alkyne insertion and C–H functionalization, leading to tetracyclic-fused
pyrrole and indole derivatives. Carbopalladation of the alkyne precedes the C–H
activation (Scheme 1.10a,b) [37, 38]. A related approach was reported a few years
later to furnish tetrasubstituted helical alkenes (Scheme 1.10c) [39].
The vinyl-Pd(II) species can undergo an exo-migratory insertion across NBE or
norbornadiene followed by C–H activation to incorporate the bicycle in the final
product. This method provided a different kind of tetrasubstituted helical alkenes
as a single diastereomer (Scheme 1.11a) [40]. Interestingly, using chiral bromoalkyl
aryl alkynes resulted in moderate diastereoselectivities (Scheme 1.11b) [41]. It was
proposed the R4 substituent induces helical chirality upon ipso-alkyne insertion
and the resulting major vinylpalladium(II) species is favored over the minor due6 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

Nucleophilic attack on the vinyl-Pd(II) species can also occur. The Luan group
reported two methodologies involving the dearomatization of indole and a phenol
system, respectively, thereby forming a spiro palladacycle upon nucleophilic
substitution (Scheme 1.12) [44, 45]. In a related report, Zhang, Liang, Li, and Quan
synthesized indoles via a concerted C–N bond forming and N–S bond cleaving
process following ipso-alkyne insertion [46].

Ipso Dearomatization Using a similar bromoalkyl-tethered indoles with a free N–H
group, a dearomatization step can occur in the presence of a base. The ortho￾functionalized arylpalladium(II) intermediate undergoes a ligand substitution with
the deprotonated indole at its 3-position to subsequently provide spiroindolenines
(Scheme 1.13) [47].
Scheme 1.13 Synthesis of spiroindolenines.
Ipso Enolate Termination A related carbon-based nucleophile can be gener￾ated as a metal-enolate. Zhou developed a three-component synthesis of 1,8-
disubstituted tetralines from 2-substituted aryl iodides, aryl methyl ketones and
1-bromo-3-chloropropane (Scheme 1.14a). It was proposed the aryl methyl ketones
reacted with 1-bromo-3-chloropropane under the basic conditions via an SN2
reaction to form a bromoalkyl-tethered ketone prior to entering the catalytic
cycle [48]. Liang synthesized spirodihydroindenones using a bromoalkyl-tethered
cyclopentanone bearing an acidic α-proton (Scheme 1.14b) [49]. Zhou reported an
enantioselective annulative process using a bromomethyl-tethered cyclohexanone
that formed an enamine in situ with a chiral amino acid catalyst (Scheme 1.14c) [50].
Ipso C–Alkyl Termination Alkyl nucleophiles using organometallic reagents are
generally considered to be less successful in transition-metal-catalyzed reactions
compared to aryl or vinyl nucleophiles due to the increased number of possible
side-reactions that may occur, for instance β–H elimination and the more difficult
transmetallation processes. As such, using an alkyl carbagermatrane as a fine-tuned
organogermanium reagent, Xiao was able to construct carbocycles with ring sizes
ranging from six to eight (Scheme 1.15) [51].
Ipso C–N Termination A nucleophilic heteroatom can also be employed as a com￾patible ipso terminating reagent. Using brominated alkylamines, Lautens was able
to furnish indolines and tetrahydroquinolines depending on the alkyl chain’s length
(Scheme 1.16)[52, 53].It was established that a para-nitrophenyl group asR4 wasthe
optimal nitrogen-protecting group for the synthesis of indolines. Phenyl and ethoxy￾carbonyl were the only other groups that were found to be compatible.
1.2.1.2 Ortho Arylation
Ipso C–N Termination Ortho-arylation is usually conducted with a less reactive
haloarene than the one meant to undergo sequential ortho- and ipso-functionali￾zations. Typically, the former is an aryl bromide and the latter, an aryl iodide. The1.2 Intramolecular Cyclizations 9

careful choice of different haloarenes ensures Pd(0) oxidatively adds into the more
reactive C–I bond preferentially and that the ANP then reacts with the less reactive
aryl bromide. Lautens showed aryl triflates can be used instead of aryl iodides [54],
while aryl chlorides can also constitute the ortho-arylating reagent [54–56]. Two
bromoarenes can also be used as coupling partners, although significant electronic
differences make one more reactive than the other [57].
Catellani applied this reasoning in her synthesis of 6-phenanthridinones by react￾ing iodoarenes with 2-bromobenzamides (Scheme 1.17) [58]. Once ortho-arylation10 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

and NBE extrusion occurred, an ipso-C–N coupling took place to furnish the desired
azacycles.
Scheme 1.17 Synthesis of 6-phenanthridinones.
Various N-heterocycles of different ring sizes were synthesized based on this
method (Scheme 1.18) [54, 55, 57, 59–66].
Ipso C–O Termination Similarly, C—O bond formation can occur using the appropri￾ate terminating reagents (Scheme 1.19 [67–70].
Various C=X Bonds as Ipso Heck Terminating Reagents Carbonyls can serve as
ipso-terminating reagents, although their reactivity differs significantly depending
on the functional group to which they belong and on the reaction conditions.
Lautens was able to synthesize 9H-fluoren-9-ols from ketones as well as
9H-fluoren-9-ones from esters and aldehydes via direct addition to the carbonyl
(Scheme 1.20) [56].
Using a chiral NBE derivative, Zhou was able to generate fluorenols enantioselec￾tively (Scheme 1.21) [71].1.2 Intramolecular Cyclizations 11
Scheme 1.18 Subsequent examples of ortho-arylation/ipso-C–N termination annulative

2-Bromoarylaldehyde hydrazones were used in a denitrogenative synthesis of
fluorenes (Scheme 1.22) [72]. It was determined the reaction pathway does not
proceed via carbene insertion.
Ipso Enolate Termination The Lautens group included three examples of enolates
as terminating reagents in their work on carbonyls as ipso terminating reagents
(Scheme 1.23) [56]. Tweaking the conditions by removing water and changing
the solvent from DME to acetonitrile modulated the system’s reactivity and
favored enolate formation rather than the direct addition of the arylpalladium(II)
intermediate to the ketone.
1.2.1.3 Ortho Acylation
Ipso Heck Termination Using a mixed anhydride, Dong discovered how to ortho￾acylate aryl iodides [73]. Subsequently, an extension of this method was developed
to generate macrocycles via an ipso-Heck termination step (Scheme 1.24) [74].
Smaller ring systems were also accessible using an analogous reagent
(Scheme 1.25) [11]. A mixed anhydride could also be generated in situ from12 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

the corresponding carboxylic acid and the Yamaguchi reagent [75]. Carbamoyl
chlorides were developed as alternative ortho-acylating reagents, giving access to
related carbocycles [76, 77].
Scheme 1.25 Subsequent examples of ortho-acylation/ipso-Heck termination annulative

Ipso C–H Arylation Jiao was the first to use carbamoyl chlorides as ortho-acylating
reagents in Pd/NBE chemistry. These reagents were tethered to aryl rings, thereby
leading to an intramolecular ipso C–H arylation termination, which furnished the
corresponding phenanthridinones (Schemes 1.26, 1.27) [77].

methodologies.
Dong obtained a fluorenone as a side-product in one of the scope examples
of their reaction using benzoic anhydride and an isopropyl carbonate anhydride
derived from benzoic acid (Scheme 1.27) [73]. Lumb and Luan obtained a similar
side-product during the optimization of their reaction using benzoic anhydride as
well [78]. Dong reported a single example starting from an alkenyl triflate [76].
Chen and Zhu demonstrated fluorinated imidoyl chlorides could also be used as
ortho-acylating reagents [79].
1.2.1.4 Ortho Amination and Ipso Heck Termination
A significant advance in Catellani methodology was the ortho-amination
using Pd/ NBE cooperative catalysis, as reported by Dong in 2013, using
O-benzoylhydroxylamines. This finding was the first time a heteroatom was
introduced at the ortho position [80]. Since then, multiple reports have made use
of this methodology to generate aminated arenes as well as N-heterocycles. For
example, Zhou developed an amination reagent tethered to a silyl enol ether to
make N-containing bridged scaffolds (Scheme 1.28) [81].
Scheme 1.28 Synthesis of N-containing bridged scaffolds via ortho-amination/ipso-Heck
annulation.
The Liu and Dong groups concurrently published on a related topic in which
C3,C4-disubstituted indoles were synthesized using near-identical conditions
(Scheme 1.29) [82, 83].
Shortly after, Dong discovered that a C7-brominated NBE (N7) was key in
generating tetrahydrobenzo[b]azepines using ortho-unfunctionalized aryl iodides
as substrates (Scheme 1.30a) [12].
This methodology bypasses the long-standing “ortho constraint.” All but two
products were accompanied by a minor regioisomer arising from reinsertion1.2 Intramolecular Cyclizations 15

of the Pd–H species wherein the alkene ends up inside the seven-membered
ring in conjugation with the aryl ring. It was postulated that the absence of an
ortho-substituent leads to a Pd–H reinsertion step, thereby furnishing a tertiary
C(sp3)–Pd(II) intermediate that undergoes β–H elimination inside the ring. When
using ortho-functionalized aryl iodides, no isomerized products were obtained, most
likely due to the ortho-substituents’ bulkiness (Scheme 1.30b). Optimization of this
reaction demonstrated C2-substituted NBE N8 constituted the most appropriate
bicyclic alkene to direct the transformation.
A crystal structure of the complex shown in Scheme 1.31 was obtained, wherein
the bromine atom acts as an L ligand coordinating to d8 Pd, thereby reducing side
reactions by stabilizing reaction intermediates. The bromo substituent is proposed to
stabilize the β–C elimination transition state to promote NBE extrusion rather than
a second ortho-C–H activation step, which would lead to ortho-difunctionalization.
Additionally, the bromine’s electronegativity hinders direct C–C reductive elimina￾tion from the ANP due to charge repulsion with the metalated aryl ring. Lastly,
although the Br substituent is more sterically hindered than a hydrogen, it is not
bulky enough to prevent the ANP from reacting with the electrophile.
1.2.1.5 Ortho Alkenylation and Ipso Amination via Reversal of Regioselectivity
Interestingly, using oxime acetates derived from methyl ketones led to formal
ortho-alkenylation and ipso-amination (Scheme 1.32) [84]. Following the ANP’s16 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

oxidative addition into the oxime acetate’s N–O bond, the resulting Pd–N-bound
isomer tautomerizes to its corresponding Pd–C-bound isomer. This process
subsequently leads to a C–C reductive elimination at the ortho-position and a C–N
reductive elimination at the ipso-position.
Scheme 1.32 Indole formation via reversal of traditional regioselectivity of the
electrophilic and terminating groups.
1.2.1.6 Pd(II)-Initiated Annulations
Aryl (pseudo)halides and palladium(0) complexes are not the only entry points for
Catellani reactions. Alternatively, boronic esters and free (N–H) indoles can react
with Pd(II) complexes to initiate the desired transformation, as first demonstrated
by Bach for intermolecular reactions (Scheme 1.33) [85–88]. In the case of boronic
esters, reductive elimination generates Pd(0) after the formation of the ring via a
Heck reaction step. Therefore oxygen must be present in the reaction mixture to
oxidize Pd(0) to Pd(II) to complete the catalytic cycle. As for free (N–H) indoles,
protodepalladation occurs after formation of the ring to regenerate the active Pd(II)
catalyst, thereby avoiding the zero oxidation state.

1.2.2 Aryl Halide Tethered to Terminating Reagent
1.2.2.1 Ortho Alkylation, Ortho Arylation and Ortho Amination
A second type of intramolecular cyclization involves functionalizing the haloarene
ortho-C–H bond followed by ipso-annulation with an already existing functional
group tethered to the haloarene. The biggest challenge to overcome is the direct
ipso-annulation, which would occurif the ortho-functionalization via an intermolec￾ular formation of the ANP were too slow relative to the intramolecular cyclization
step.
Lautens was the first to successfully report this annulative strategy, which
provided ortho-alkylated benzoxacycles(Scheme 1.34) [89]. Only one other example
involving ortho-alkylation followed by an intramolecular Heck reaction has been
reported [90].
Scheme 1.34 First methodology of ortho-functionalization with an external reagent
followed by intramolecular ipso-termination.
Subsequent methodologies based on this type of cyclization have generated
various carbo- and heterocycles (Scheme 1.35). Other methodologies employing
ortho-alkylations have been paired with ipso C–alkyl [91] and C–N terminations
[92]. Ortho-arylations have been combined with ipso-functionalizations such as
Heck [93, 94]), C–N [92], C–H arylations [95, 96], and alkyne insertion [97]. As for
ortho-aminations, these have been matched with ipso-Heck [90]), C–N [98], C–H
arylation [99–103], and C–H alkylation terminations [102, 104].
1.2.3 Aryl Halide Tethered to Electrophile
1.2.3.1 Ortho Alkylation
The third type of intramolecular cyclization involves functionalizing the haloarene
substrate’s ortho-C–H bond with an already existing functional group tethered to
the haloarene followed by intermolecular ipso-annulation. In a seminal report,
Lautens used meta-substituted iodoarenes to functionalize both ortho-positions
with two different electrophiles, one being the tethered alkyl halide and the other,
an external alkyl halide (Scheme 1.36a) [105]. A Heck termination constituted the
ipso-functionalizing step. Aryl iodides with substituents at the 2- and 5-positions
relative to the C–I bond were also compatible. However no external alkyl halide
was added due to there being only one available ortho-C–H bond (Scheme 1.36b).18 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

This method wassubsequently combined with the original intramolecular cycliza￾tion strategy using a difunctional ambident species (bromoenoate or bromoalkyl
indole) (Scheme 1.37) [106].
Since then, various groups have devised variations on the method, using Heck
couplings [53, 107–111] as well as different terminations, including C(sp2)–H1.2 Intramolecular Cyclizations 19

1.2.4 Aryl Halide Tethered to Electrophile and Terminating Reagent
1.2.4.1 Ortho Alkylation
The final type of intramolecular cyclization consists of making the electrophilic
and terminating groups part of the same molecule as the substrate haloarene. Only
two reports of such a strategy have been disclosed, both by Lautens (Scheme 1.39)
[53, 108].
The use of enantioenriched substrates led to the corresponding enantioenriched
products with an overall inversion of configuration at the stereocenter with either
minimal or significant decrease in ee depending on the substrate class and reaction
conditions. In Scheme 1.40a, a mere 2% decrease in ee was observed when convert￾ing the alkyl iodide substrate to the corresponding tricyclic product. On the other
hand, in Scheme 1.40b, subjecting the alkyl bromide substrate to the reaction con￾ditions resulted in a cyclized product with a net −14% ee difference. Mechanistic20 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

studies showed CsI formed under the reaction conditions can racemize the sub￾strate’s chiral center in MeCN (Scheme 1.40b), but not in DME (Scheme 1.40a) due
to the salt’s increased solubility in the former solvent. It was proposed that inversion
of configuration takes place at the oxidative addition step from Pd(II)to Pd(IV) via an
SN2 mechanism, as reductive elimination from Pd(IV) to Pd(II) occurs via retention
of configuration [116–118].

1.3 Intermolecular Cyclizations Following
Intermolecular Ortho Functionalization
Contrary to Section 1, which focused on annulations wherein at least two out of
the aryl halide, electrophile and terminating reagent components are tethered to
one another, Section 2 describes ring-closing methods in which all three constitute
separate molecules that react sequentially.
1.3.1 Ortho Arylation
1.3.1.1 Ipso Alkyne Insertion and Ipso Formal Benzyne Insertion
Catellani synthesized phenanthrenes using two equivalents of an ortho-substituted
aryl iodide, one of them acting as the electrophile, and an alkyne partner to close
the ring via sequential carbopalladation and reductive elimination (Scheme 1.41)
[119]. Kwong also developed a regioselective synthesis of phenanthrenes, this
time from two different aryl halides that allowed greater molecular complexity
in the final product. CO2 was extruded as a result of decarboxylation of the
ortho-bromoarylcarboxylic acid in the catalytic cycle [120].

Triphenylenes were synthesized by Liang and Yang according to a similar method
to Catellani’s wherein two equivalents of an ortho-bromoarylcarboxylic acid were
needed (Scheme 1.42) [121].
Luan synthesized spirocycles via a three-component reaction using bromonaph￾thols as electrophiles, which ultimately underwent a dearomatization process in
order to close the catalytic cycle (Scheme 1.43) [97].22 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

1.3.2 Ortho Amination
1.3.2.1 Ipso Alkyne Insertion
Zhang et al. synthesized indoles via an interesting process (Scheme 1.44). The final
steps of the reaction first involve the formation of an intermediary indole quaternary
ammonium salt, which is postulated to weaken the N–Me bond. A final SN2 displace￾ment with a benzoate anion gives rise to the desired indole and methyl benzoate as
the by-product [122].
1.4 Cyclizations with Three-Membered Heterocycles
as Both the Electrophile and Terminating Reagent
Three-membered heterocycles can serve as both the electrophile and the terminating
agent. Their innate strain renders them reactive to the oxidative addition step with
the ANP, thereby breaking one of the C–heteroatom bonds. A chemoselective C–C
reductive elimination occursto functionalize the haloarene’s ortho-position. Follow￾ing NBE extrusion, C–N or C–O reductive elimination takes place to furnish a new
heterocyclic five-membered ring.1.4 Cyclizations with Three-Membered Heterocycles as Both the Electrophile and Terminating Reagent 23
Scheme 1.44 Synthesis of indoles from aryl iodides, O-benzoylhydroxylamines, and

1.4.1 2H-Azirines
Lautens reported the synthesis of indoles using 2H-azirines, which were added
via slow addition to the reaction mixture and resulted in a 1:1 ratio relative to the
aryl iodide (Scheme 1.45a) [123]. Excess 2H-azirine resulted in the formation of
dihydroimidazoles (Scheme 1.45b).
(a)
(b)
Scheme 1.45 Synthesis of (a) indoles and (b) dihydroimidazoles from aryl iodides and
2H-azirines.
Coordination of the nitrogen lone pair to the ANP’s Pd(II) center weakens
the 2H-azirine’s bonds, which allows oxidative addition of the Pd(II) into the
ligand’s C–N single bond to occur to furnish the corresponding Pd(IV) complex
(Scheme 1.46) [124–129]. Reductive elimination via a chemoselective C–C bond
formation leads to an eight-membered palladacycle, which is followed by NBE
extrusion to give rise to a more stable six-membered palladacycle. A 3H-indole
is then formed by a final reductive elimination, thereby regenerating the active
Pd(0) catalyst. Tautomerization to the more thermodynamically stable 1H-indole
takes place when no excess 2H-azirine is present. However, exposure to another24 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

equivalent of 2H-azirine leadsto a dihydroimidazole via a postulated Pd(0)-catalyzed
formal [3+2]-cycloaddition.
1.4.2 Aziridines
Similarly, Bi and Liang generated indolines from aryl iodides and aziridines
(Scheme 1.47) [130]. These make analogous products to those previously reported
by Lautens using bromoethylamines (Scheme 1.17) [52]. The latter initially thought
the formation of aziridines from bromoethylamines by intramolecular nucleophilic
displacement had to be avoided for the reaction to work. However, Bi and Liang’s
report suggests that the formation of the aziridine might have been the productive
reaction pathway.

1.4.3 Epoxides
Dong synthesized 2,3-dihydrobenzofurans from aryl iodides and epoxides
(Scheme 1.48a) [131]. The same family of products was later generated by
Cheng and Zhou under considerably different conditions (Scheme 1.48b) [132].

Both methodologies include an example of an enantiopure epoxide that leads to
a stereoretentive annulation without any loss of ee in the product. Subsequently,
Dong reported an enantioselective version of the reaction using racemic epoxides
with an enantiopure chiral NBE derivative that furnished the corresponding
2,3-dihydrobenzofurans in moderate ee [133].
1.5 Norbornene/Norbornadiene-Integrated Cyclizations
1.5.1 Norbornene
Although NBE is usually used as a transient directing group, it can sometimes be
integrated in the final product to form different types of ring systems. Some reports
have even disclosed results showing that exceptions to the general rules in Catellani
chemistry exist.
For example, NBE-incorporated adducts derived from C(sp2)–C(sp3) reductive
elimination from the Pd(IV) intermediate were generated instead of products
derived from the usual C(sp2)–C(sp2) reductive elimination (Scheme 1.49a) [134].
This outcome could be explained due to chelation of the amide moiety of the
2-bromophenylacetamide that generates steric strain in the transition state that
would lead to C(sp2)–C(sp2) reductive elimination, thereby hindering this pathway.
However, it was observed that adding water leads to C(sp2)–C(sp2) reductive
elimination due to displacement of the P(2-furyl)3 ligand, thereby decreasing
the steric strain in the corresponding transition state and favoring this pathway.
Water also hampered NBE extrusion and rather led to a dearomatized product via
sequential 5-exo-migratory insertion and β–H elimination (Scheme 1.49b).26 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

Similarly, dihydrodibenzoazepine derivatives were synthesized from aryl iodides,
ortho-bromoanilines, and NBE (Scheme 1.50a) [135]. These compounds resulted
from C(sp2)–C(sp3) reductive elimination from the Pd(IV) intermediate due to the
chelation of the ortho-bromoaniline’s amino group to palladium. A subsequent
report used aryl bromides instead of aryl iodides with potassium iodide as an
additive (Scheme 1.50b) [136].

(b)
Scheme 1.50 Synthesis of NBE-containing azacycles following C(sp2)–C(sp3) reductive
elimination using (a) aryl iodides (b) aryl bromides.
Interestingly, while combining ortho-substituted aryl iodides with 2-bromo-NH￾sulfoximines leads to the usual C(sp2)–C(sp2) reductive elimination, aryl iodides
containing electron-withdrawing groups at the meta-position led to NBE-containing
adducts resulting from C(sp2)–C(sp3) reductive elimination (Scheme 1.51a) [62].
Increasing the equivalents of 2-bromo-NH-sulfoximine led to adducts bearing two
sulfoximine moieties (Scheme 1.51b).
Other examplesinvolve varioustermination stepsthat outcompete NBE extrusion
[137–147]. For example, these steps may involve nucleophilic substitution on the1.5 Norbornene/Norbornadiene-Integrated Cyclizations 27

norbornylpalladium(II) intermediate or a migratory insertion into the C–Pd bond of
that intermediate (Scheme 1.52).
Scheme 1.52 Subsequent examples of NBE-containing adducts.
As mentioned earlier (Section Ipso Alkyne Insertion), Lautens was able to
incorporate NBE in the final product following ortho and ipso functionalization to
provide tetrasubstituted helical alkenes (Scheme 1.11) [40, 41].
1.5.2 Norbornadiene
Although rarely used, norbornadiene can replace NBE and be a compatible partner
in Catellani-type reactions. Both of their alkenyl hydrogens deviate in the endo
direction relative to the C1–C2 plane, with an angle of 7∘ for NBE and about
2–4∘ for norbornadiene (Scheme 1.53) [148]. In both cases, the fact the alkene
moiety is pyramidalized instead of flat is a result of the system attempting to28 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry
minimize torsional strain and therefore the distortion energy. This leads to a
distortion-accelerated reaction upon submitting the bicyclic alkene to a compatible
reagent.
Scheme 1.53 Structural comparison between NBE and norbornadiene.
In 2017, Luan reported the synthesis of aminated spirocarbocycles having inte￾grated a norbornadiene fragment (Scheme 1.54) [149]. Following ortho-amination,
palladium-induced phenol dearomatization outcompetes norbornadiene extrusion
via ligand substitution on the metal.
Scheme 1.54 Synthesis of norbornadiene-fused spirocarbocycles via phenol
dearomatization.
Incorporation of a retro-Diels–Alder step formally installs a molecule of acetylene
into the product, ejecting a molecule of cyclopentadiene. Derat andCatellani demon￾strated this concept in their synthesis of dibenzoazepines by replacing NBE with
norbornadiene (Scheme 1.55a) [135]. Della Ca’ used an aryl bromide instead of an
aryl iodide and obtained analogous results (Scheme 1.55b) [136].

Lautens had shown that ortho-bromoanilines and ortho-chlorobenzamides react
with norbornadiene in the presence of palladium, and undergo a retro Diels–Alder
step to provide accessto indoles and isoquinolinones[150]. The Liang group adapted
this strategy and added in a Catellani step to construct C4-functionalized indoles
via ortho-amination or ortho-glycosylation, with the C2 and C3 atoms being pro￾vided by norbornadiene or its tosylated derivative (Scheme 1.56) [151, 152]. Using
2-iodobiphenyls assubstrates, Liang was able to generate 1-aminated phenanthrenes
(Scheme 1.57) [153]. A concurrent synthesis of such products was also developed by
Yang and Liang using similar conditions [154].

Finally, Lin and Kwong employed 2-haloarylcarboxylic acids and 8-bromo-1-
naphthoic acid to provide the phenanthrene and benzo[4,5]cyclohepta[1,2,3-de]
naphthalene derivatives, respectively (Scheme 1.58) [155].
1.6 One-Pot Postcatalytic Intramolecular Cyclizations
1.6.1 Postcatalytic Intramolecular Michael Additions
1.6.1.1 Ortho Alkylation
In some cases, the product of the catalytic reaction does not yet contain a ring,
but subsequent cyclization can occur after the catalytic cycle. For example, using30 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

N-Cbz-bromoalkylamines and α-chloroamides as the electrophile and activated
alkenes as the ipso-Heck acceptor, Ferraccioli synthesized six- and seven-membered
N-heterocycles via a postcatalytic aza-Michael addition (Scheme 1.59) [156–158].

Epoxides and aziridines have also been used as electrophiles by Cheng and
Zhou that, respectively, formed alcohols and amines as products after the catalytic
cycle, respectively. Similarly to Ferraccioli’s work, oxa- and aza-Michael additions
then took place to form the corresponding oxa- and azacycles (Scheme 1.60)
[22, 159, 160].
1.6.1.2 Ortho Arylation
Bromoarenes have also been used in this type of process to synthesize 6H-dibenzo￾pyrans, dihydrophenanthridines, and dibenzoazepines (Scheme 1.61) [161–164].
6H-Dibenzopyrans were subsequently generated enantioselectively using a
cinchona alkaloid cocatalyst [165].1.6 One-Pot Postcatalytic Intramolecular Cyclizations 31

Interestingly, using methyl vinyl ketone as the ipso-terminating reagent leads to
a retro-Mannich reaction to furnish the corresponding phenanthridines and imines
(Scheme 1.62) [164, 166].
1.6.2 Postcatalytic Intramolecular Addition to Norbornyl Moiety
Finally, an interesting NBE-containing scaffold could be obtained using 3-
iodochromones, α-bromoacetophenones and NBE (Scheme 1.63) [167]. Instead of32 1 The Palladium/Norbornene-Catalyzed Annulation Chemistry

the usual β-C elimination step resulting in the extrusion of NBE, a base-mediated
β-H elimination step took place, which kept the norbornyl fragment in the product.
Keto-enol tautomerization followed by intramolecular cyclization was proposed to
deliver the spirocycle in a formal (2+3+1) annulation. A subsequent report using
tetracyclododecene instead of NBE led to a formal (2+2+1) annulation [168].

1.7 Summary
Since the first report by Catellani in 1997, the use of NBE to temporarily direct C–H
functionalization has become of increasing interest in the synthesis of functionalized
aromatic compounds. Lautens first introduced phosphine ligands to the catalytic
system, which are now broadly used in this type of reaction. Lautens also reported
the first annulative approach using the Catellani reaction. In the intervening two
decades, many research groups have contributed to the reaction and to annulation
strategies specifically. Ring formation can occur in many ways, including by tether￾ing the electrophile or nucleophile, intermolecularly following ortho functionaliza￾tion with an external electrophile, by using a three-membered ring as the coupling
partner, by integrating NBE or norbornadiene in the final scaffold, and following
of the catalytic cycle. The future of this field looks brighter with each passing year
as more groups provide creative approaches that incorporate annulative Catellani
reactions.References 33

2.1 Introduction
The palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis, also known as the
Catellani-type reaction, is a method that could simultaneously introduce func￾tional groups to the ortho-position and ipso-position of halogenated arenes. The
reaction has high chemoselectivity and complete regioselectivity and has the
potential to be used in the fields of natural product synthesis, medicinal chemistry,
and material science; therefore, this field has attracted extensive attention from
chemical researchers. Among them, the ipso functionalization, i.e. the termination
step of the catalytic cycle, is crucial for the generation of target products and the
regeneration of the palladium catalysts. The earliest and most widely developed
Pd/NBE cocatalyzed ipso functionalization reaction was discovered by Italian
chemist Catellani in 1997, i.e. the ipso alkenylation reaction, which is also the first
catalytic version of this reaction. Compared with the ortho-C—H functionalization
of arenes, the ipso functionalization has been systematically developed in the past
two decades. This is because most of the elementary steps of the ipso functional￾ization can be derived from classical palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions,
such as Mizoroki–Heck reaction, Suzuki–Miyaura reaction, and Sonogashira
reaction. In recent years, new reactions such as C(sp3 or sp2)—H bond activation,
C—N bond cleavage, and C—C bond cleavage reactions have also been found
compatible with the ipso functionalization. Besides, Pd/NBE chemistry has also
been used to construct highly functionalized polyarylate polymers by designing ipso
functionalization reagents.
The mechanism of the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis is complex and involves
many elementary steps. The catalytic cycle generally consists of several stages:
oxidative addition of halogenated benzene with zero-valent palladium, ortho C—H
functionalization, NBE removal, and ipso functionalization [1–4]. Similarly, like
other domino reactions, there are a large number of competitive reactions in the
Pd/NBE catalytic cycle; thus, regulating the reactivity in each step to minimize46 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization
side reactions is crucial for the success of the Pd/NBE catalysis. Therefore, the first
part of this chapter systematically discusses the four competitive reactions of ipso
functionalization reagents in the whole catalytic cycle from the mechanism level:
(i) competitive pathways between ipso functionalization and NBE insertion; (ii)
compatibility between electrophile reagents and ipso functionalization reagents;
(iii) process of NBE removal and ipso functionalization; and (iv) dehalogenation
reaction and ipso functionalization reaction. In the following part, different
ipso functionalization reactions will be systematically introduced, and their key
mechanisms will be discussed in detail.
2.2 Ipso Functionalization Reaction in the Pd/NBE
Catalytic Cycle
2.2.1 The Role of Ipso Functionalization Reaction in the Catalytic Cycle
The Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis reaction has complex mechanism and contains
multiple elementary steps. In each step of the catalytic cycle, the palladium inter￾mediate may react with ipso functionalization reagents to generate undesired side
products. Therefore, a detailed and systematic understanding of the whole catalytic
cycle is essential for understanding the ipso functionalization. The reaction path can
generally be divided into the following four stages (Scheme 2.1):
1) Starting Step: Oxidative addition of zero valent palladium with aryl halides
forms aryl Pd(II) intermediate B. (A to B).
2) The Ortho C–H Functionalization: (i) The aryl Pd(II) intermediate B and NBE
undergo migratory insertion process and C—H bond activation to generate the
aryl-norbornyl-palladacycle (ANP) intermediate C and (ii) the ANP intermediate
and the electrophilic reagent undergo oxidative addition and subsequent reduc￾tive elimination to generate the ortho C–H functionalized intermediate D. The
ANP oxidative addition can go through either an SN2 or concerted process (see
Chapter 3). (B–E)
3) NBE Removal: Promoted by the “ortho constraint” (see Chapter 7), the β-carbon
elimination process of the intermediate producesthe bivalent palladium interme￾diate F during the process of NBE removal. (E to F)
4) Ipso Functionalization: The aryl Pd(II) intermediate F can be coupled with
various nucleophiles (Nu−). This chapter focuses on this step. (F to product)
2.2.2 Competitive or Side Reactions of Ipso Functionalization
2.2.2.1 Competitive Pathways Between Ipso Functionalization and NBE
Insertion
The ipso functionalization step generally involves the coupling reaction between
the Pd(II) aryl intermediate and a nucleophile (including alkenes), such as
Mizoroki–Heck, Suzuki–Miyaura, and Sonogashira coupling reactions. In the2.2 Ipso Functionalization Reaction in the Pd/NBE Catalytic Cycle 47

whole Pd/NBE catalytic cycle, there are at least two different aryl Pd(II) interme￾diates, namely, intermediate B generated directly from the oxidative addition of
the aryl halide substrate with Pd(0) complex and the ortho C–H functionalized
intermediate (F). Therefore, it is easy to speculate that the catalytic cycle has at
least a pair of competitive products: the one from direct ipso functionalization
of aryl halides and the one from ortho C–H functionalization followed by ipso
functionalization (Scheme 2.2).
It should be noted that the formation of the competitive side-product is generally
dictated by the relative reaction rate between the NBE migratory insertion with the
aryl Pd(II) intermediates (B–C) and the direct ipso coupling (B to side-product 1).
In a normal situation, if the insertion rate of Pd(II) intermediate B to NBE is faster
than the rate of ipso functionalization, the reaction tends to occur ortho C–H func￾tionalization to produce the final target product. On the contrary, if the addition
rate of intermediate B to NBE is slower than the rate of ipso functionalization, the48 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization

direct ipso functionalization side-product 1 will be generated. For example, in 2017,
the Bi group used density functional theory (DFT) to study the reaction mecha￾nism of the ortho C–H carbonylation and ipso alkenylation of iodobenzene, in which
ethyl acrylate was used as the ipso alkenylation reagent [5]. First of all, iodobenzene
and zero-valent palladium undergo an oxidative addition process to produce biva￾lent palladium intermediate A1. The intermediate A1 can be inserted into NBE or
ethyl acrylate, and the reaction energy barriers are 16.3 kcal/mol and 18.0 kcal/mol,
respectively. Therefore, the reaction rate of NBE insertion is faster, which is a pro￾cess controlled by kinetics. After the migratory insertion process, 9.8 kcal/mol and
26.8 kcal/mol are released, respectively, indicating that these steps are almost irre￾versible, especially with ethyl acrylate. It can be concluded that TS-A3 and TS-A3′
are two key transition states, which directly affect the selectivity of the reaction
(Scheme 2.3). Note that under the catalytic condition, many factors can affect the
process, such as structurally modified NBEs (smNBEs), ligands, and solvents.
Generally, the migratory insertion reaction between aryl Pd(II) intermediate and
NBE is relatively fast, which is due to the exposed electron cloud of the π bond of
NBE and low steric hindrance.
2.2.2.2 Compatibility Between Electrophile Reagents and Ipso
Functionalization Reagents
In general, ipso functionalization reagents can generally be considered nucleophiles,
while ortho C–H functionalization reagents are generally electrophilic species (see
Chapter 3). Therefore, ipso functionalization reagents and ortho C–H functionaliza￾tion reagents could potentially react with each other. As described in Scheme 2.4,
the electrophile used in the ortho functionalization should react faster with the ANP
species(though oxidative addition/reductive elimination) than with the nucleophile
in order to form the desired product selectively.2.2 Ipso Functionalization Reaction in the Pd/NBE Catalytic Cycle 49

Scheme 2.4 Electrophile reagents and ipso functionalization reagents.
For example, when amines are used as the nucleophile for ipso functionalization,
they can easily react with common electrophiles,such as alkyl bromides or acyl chlo￾rides, under alkaline conditions(Scheme 2.5). Therefore, when reagents with strong
nucleophilicity are used as the ipso functionalization reagents, the desired reaction
often cannot proceed smoothly.
2.2.2.3 Process of NBE Extrusion and Ipso Functionalization
In a normal Pd/NBE-catalyzed reaction, only after the NBE extrusion, ipso func￾tionalization can occur with the nucleophilic reagent. However, if the NBE extru￾sion is slow, a competitive pathway involving reductive elimination between the
nucleophile and the norbornyl group, namely premature termination, can take place
(Scheme 2.6). An important factor affecting the β-carbon elimination process of NBE50 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization

is the “ortho constraint,” i.e. the steric hindrance of ortho substituent groups on the
aryl arene promotes the β-carbon elimination [6]. It requires that both ortho posi￾tions of the aryl group of the palladium intermediate E contain substituents. It is
worth mentioning that the Dong group overcame the “ortho constraint” by using
smNBEs and realized the NBE removal of intermediate E substituted by an ortho
group (see Chapter 7) [7].2.2 Ipso Functionalization Reaction in the Pd/NBE Catalytic Cycle 51
In addition, the process of NBE removal can also be regulated by ligands. Asshown
in Scheme 2.7, the energy barriers of NBE extrusion with three phosphine ligands
are calculated and compared by DFT. It can be seen that the reaction rate of using a
bidentate phosphine ligand, dCypb, is the fastest [8].

2.2.2.4 Dehalogenation Reaction and Ipso Functionalization Reaction
The dehalogenation (hydrogenation) reaction refers to a process that the Pd(II)
intermediate F from the catalytic cycle is quenched by a hydride source rather
than the nucleophile (Scheme 2.8). The hydride source can come from alcohol
intermediates produced by hydrolysis ofsolvents or haloalkanes. The Lautens group
found that dimethoxyethane (DME) and benzyl chloride can reduce intermediate
F to generate hydrogenation products, and the corresponding deuterium-labeling
experiments proved this view [9, 10]. Ether solvents, such as 1,4-dioxane and
tetrahydrofuran (THF), are commonly used in the Pd/NBE catalytic systems; thus,
dehalogenation products are common side reactions. In addition, the mechanism
of some dehydrohalogenation reactions is still unclear, but the trend is that when
the ipso functionalization is slow, the yield of dehydrohalogenation increases. For
example, when the C(sp3)—H bond activation reaction serves as an ipso alkylation
quench, without the addition of pivalic acid (PivOH) to promote the concerted
metalation deprotonation (CMD), the dehalogenated arenes became one of the
main side products [11].

2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions
2.3.1 Alkenylation Reaction
2.3.1.1 Heck Coupling
Heck reaction, as the most common and practical alkenylation reaction of halo￾genated aromatic hydrocarbons, has been frequently used as ipso functionalization
to combine with the Pd/NBE chemistry. At the same time, the first example of ipso
alkenylation is also the first case of Pd/NBE cooperative catalysisreaction, which was
discovered by Catellani in 1997 [12]. In this seminal work, iodoalkanes were used as
electrophilic reagents, and the ortho C–H alkylation of iodobenzene took place twice
(see Chapter 3 for the specific mechanism of this part). Then, the β-carbon elimi￾nation occurred to give the key intermediate F1, which then undergoes migratory
insertion with olefins and β-hydride elimination to generate the ipso alkenylation
product (Scheme 2.9).

In 1999, Catellani made a significant advancement in the field by demonstrating
the suitability of palladium acetate, a more readily available catalyst, as a replace￾ment for cis,exo-2-phenylnorbornylpalladium chloride (PNP) dimer in the reaction.
This substitution facilitated the progression of the reaction’s development.
The subsequent exploration of the substrate scope in the ortho alkyla￾tion/ipso alkenylation reaction revealed that olefins with different substituents
can have a great impact on the whole catalytic cycle (Scheme 2.10). Notably,
electron-withdrawing olefins exerted a promotional effect throughout the catalytic
process. For example, compared to styrene, methyl acrylate exhibits much higher
yields. Similarly, fluorinated styrene gave a higher yield than styrene [13]. The
main four-membered-ring side product 1a′ was derived from the direct reductive
elimination of the ANP intermediate. The substituents of olefins have little effect
on the production of this side product, with yields ranging from 10% to 24%.2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions 53

Lautens added phosphine ligands to the reaction condition for the first time in
2000, forming the widely used Pd/NBE/phosphorus ligand system. The addition
of phosphine ligands not only promoted the conversion of the initial Pd(II) to the
active Pd(0) in the catalytic cycle but also greatly improved the chemoselectivity
and the yield [14]. It is noteworthy that before 2000, the reaction solvents were
generally N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), and
N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). After the use of the phosphine ligands, acetonitrile,
THF, toluene, and 1,4-dioxane become common solvents for ortho C–H alkylation
and ispo alkenylation. In 2006, Lautens extended the ortho C–H alkylation and
ipso alkenylation reaction from simple aryl iodides to iodinated heteroarenes
[15]. In addition, beyond using electrically neutral primary alkyl halides as the
electrophiles, employment of other electrophilic alkylation reagents based on,
such as trifluoroethane [16], secondary alkanes [17], alkylsilanes [18], methane
[8, 19–21], and β-fluoro-alkanes [22], was also gradually realized with this reaction
system (Scheme 2.11).
In 2003, Catellani first reported the ortho arylation/ipso Heck reaction
(Scheme 2.12a) [23]. The iodobenzene of this reaction acts as both the sub￾strate and the electrophilic reagent to achieve the ortho C–H arylation reaction.
This is a milestone, as it proves that the Pd/NBE catalytic reaction is not limited to54 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization

the use of alkyl electrophiles. In terms of the ipso alkenylation part, unlike in the
ortho C–H alkylation reactions, the olefin scope is broader. The target products can
be obtained with more than 70% yields with electron-deficient (e.g. methyl acrylate
and butenone), neutral, or electron-rich olefins. When 1-octene was used, the C—C
double bond isomerized to form three linear isomers with a ratio of 1 : 9 : 3. Due
to the similar polarity of these isomers, they have not been separated in their pure
from, but after the hydrogenation, compound 2d was obtained in good yield (76%).
In another report of the same year, Catellani used allyl alcohol derivatives as the
alkenylation reagents to obtain aryl ketone derivatives 2e through olefin migration
and enol tautomerization [24].
In 2004, Catellani found that the oxidative addition rates of different halogenated
aromatics with Pd(0) complexes and ANP intermediates were different, which then
led to the selective ortho-C–H arylation (Scheme 2.12b) [25]. Compared with the
C—Br bond, the C—I bond of iodobenzene has a longer bond length and weaker
bond energy, which is easier to react with Pd(0). Electron-withdrawing bromoben￾zene (such as methyl ortho-bromobenzoic acid) is more difficult to react with Pd(0),
but more inclined to react with ANP intermediate. The discovery of selective ortho
C–H arylation has greatly improved the application value of ortho C–H arylation;
the Gu group applied this method, o-nitrobromobenzene asthe ortho-C–H arylation
reagent with iodopyrrole, to the synthesis of natural product (+)-Rhazinal in 2013
(See Chapter 8)[26].In 2020, the Kumar group realized the introduction of ferrocene
to the ortho position of iodobenzenes through C–H arylation (Scheme 2.12c) [27].
It is worth noting that when o-fluoroiodobenzene was used as the substrate, only
16% of the target product 2f was generated, while 18% of the o-alkenyl product
2f′ was generated (Scheme 2.13). This is due to different reductive elimination
selectivity at the ANP intermediate [23].2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions 55

Scheme 2.12 Ortho C–H arylation and ipso alkenylation. (a) C–H self-arylation of
iodobenzene; (b) C–H arylation of bromobenzene; (c) C–H arylation of ferrocene.
The development of ortho C–H functionalization has stagnated for ten years
since Catellani developed ortho C–H alkylation and arylation in 1997 and 2003,
respectively. Until 2013, Dong discovered the ortho C–H amination of aryl halides
[28]. In 2014, the Chen group applied the ortho C–H amination reaction to ipso
alkenylation, and only electron-deficient olefins, such as acrylate and acrylonitrile,
were suitable for this method. Styrene, when used as a ipso alkenylation reagent,
cannot give the target products[29, 30]. In 2016, the Gu group employed oxygenated
olefins asipso alkenylation reagents,selectively shifting the Heck coupling of olefins
from β-site to α-site, and the products can be further converted to ketones after
hydrolysis [31]. The Cheng group further expanded this method to the synthesis of
2-aminocinnamyl esters in 2020. Interestingly, no olefin migration products were
found (Scheme 2.14) [32].
In 2015, the Liang, Dong, and Gu groups independently used carboxylic acid
anhydrides and acyl chlorides as electrophilic reagents to realize ortho C–H
acylation and ipso alkenylation of iodobenzene (Scheme 2.15) [33–35]. In the
mechanistic study reported by Gu, acyl chloride does not directly undergo oxidative56 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization

cleavage [36].
In 2016, the Dong group reported the ortho carboxylation ipso alkenyla￾tion of aryl halides by using 2,6-dimethylbenzoic acid-derived mixed anhydrides.
Electron-deficient alkenes and heteroaryl alkenes asipso alkenylation reagents were
suitable for this reaction, such as acrylates, acrylamide, and 2-vinylpyridine [37].2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions 57

Scheme 2.15 Different ortho C–H functionalization.
The ortho alkenylation is also compatible with sulfur-based electrophiles. In
2019, Gu and Dong concurrently used thiosulfonates and sulfenamide reagents as
electrophiles to achieve ortho-C–H thiolation ipso alkenylation of iodobenzenes
(Scheme 2.15) [38, 39]. The electron-deficient alkenes are suitable for this method.
The products are all trans-olefins. The Gu group found that the product is photosen￾sitive, and the cis-product can be obtained at 68% yield after 16 hours of exposure to
a 10 W blue light-emitting diode (LED) lamp.
In 2022, the Liang and Cheng groups independently reported ortho C–H glycosy￾lation ipso alkenylation of aryl iodides using chloroglycosides as the electrophiles58 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization
(Scheme 2.15) [40, 41]. The scope of olefins in this reaction is wide, and both
electron-poor and -neutral olefins can be applied to this reaction, such as acrylate,
acrylamide, 2-vinylpyridine, and styrene.
2.3.1.2 Carbene Coupling
Diazo compounds easily extrude nitrogen to form carbenes, which can coordinate
with transition metals to form metal alkylidenes (M=C) [42]. The first case of
palladium-catalyzed carbene migratory insertion coupling reaction was reported by
Van Vranken and coworkers in 2001. (Trimethylsilyl)diazomethane (TMSCHN2)
and benzoyl halides were used as the substrates to obtain styrene products [43].
The substituents on diazo carbon are generally electron-withdrawing groups
(such as ester groups), which is because alkyl- and aryl-substituted diazo com￾pounds are usually unstable and difficult to purify [42]. In 2007, Barluenga et al.
reported that N-tosylhydrazones, which are stable and can be synthesized from
ketones in one step, can generate carbenes upon treatment with a base, such as
lithium tert-butoxide (LiOt
Bu), and the resulting carbene can then couple with
aryl palladium(II) intermediates [44]. It is worth noting that the Heck coupling
generally gives 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, while the carbene coupling product gives
1,1-disubstituted alkenes. These two strategies are complementary to each other.
Because of the high reactivity of carbenes, many side reactions can be envisaged
when using carbene reagents as the ipso functionalization reagents in the Pd/NBE
catalysis. There are mainly three types: (i) Diazo compounds easily undergo dimer￾ization to produce olefins; (ii) underthe palladium catalysis, carbenes can react with
electrophilic reagents, such as benzyl halides; and (iii) carbenes can react with ANP
intermediates via migratory insertion processes (Scheme 2.16).

Scheme 2.16 Carbene coupling reaction.2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions 59
In 2014, the Liang group realized the first ipso alkenylation through coupling
with a carbene species, affording diverse 1,1-diaryl-substitued alkenes using
N-tosylhydrazones as the carbene reagents (Scheme 2.17) [45]. In the previous
reports, N-tosylhydrazones need to use strong base LiOt
Bu to be converted to diazo
compounds and further to carbenes. However, in the Pd/NBE catalytic condition,
the use of LiOt
Bu gave no target product. Instead, cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) was
found as the optimal base. The scope of the carbenes and electrophiles is wide. It
is particularly worth mentioning that two different ortho C–H alkylations can be
realized by designing the substrate, which allows for intramolecular C–H alkylation
at one side and intermolecular C–H alkylation at the other side (3o).

Scheme 2.17 Ortho C–H alkylation and ipso carbene coupling reaction.
In the same year, the Liang group extended the ipso carbene coupling
reaction to ortho C–H amination [46]. In this report, both the diazo compounds
and N-tosylhydrazones derivatives can be used for the ipso carbene coupling
(Scheme 2.18).
2.3.1.3 Allenylation Reaction
Allene is a class of compounds containing two continuous C=C double bonds
(1,2-prodiene). The central carbon is sp hybrid, and the carbon at both sides is sp2
hybrid. The π orbitals of the two C=C double bonds are perpendicular to each other
and are not conjugated. The discovery of ipso allenylation in the Pd/NBE catalysis
has a very early origin. In 2001, when Catellani studied the ortho C–H arylation and
alkyne cyclization of iodobenzenes to construct phenanthrene derivatives, it was60 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization

requires the addition of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and PivOH to increase
the yield. Various types of iodobenzenes, especially polycyclic compounds, were

suitable for this method. The drug Paroxetine, which is used to treat depression,
was directly introduced into the ortho position. Symmetrical alkynes (4a–4d) have
higher yields as allenylation reagents, while the yield from unsymmetrical alkynes
(4e) was low.
2.3.2 Alkynylation Reactions (Sonogashira Coupling)
The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between halogenated aromatic
hydrocarbons and alkynes is called Sonogashira coupling reaction [49]. Sono￾gashira coupling reaction often requires the addition of copper salts to promote
the metallization process of alkynes, but copper salt is often not added to the ipso
alkynylation reaction under the Pd/NBE cocatalysis. This may be because when
copper salt is added, the reaction activity of alkynylation is too high, and the ipso
functionalization products of iodobenzenes are directly generated without ortho
C–H functionalization (see Section 2.2.2.1).
At present, the developed alkynylation reagents mainly include terminal alkyne,
propargylic acid, and alkynol derivatives. A summary of representative examples
and reaction conditions is provided in Scheme 2.21. The ortho C–H alkylation and
ipso alkynylation of iodobenzene was discovered by Catellani group in 2004, and
only aryl-substituted alkynes are suitable for this reaction [50]. In 2016, Zhou
modified the reaction conditions to allow alkyl and silyl substituted terminal
alkynes compatible [51]. In 2015, the Gu and Wu groups independently achieved
ortho-C–H amination and ipso alkynylation of iodobenzenes, using propargic acid
and propargyl alcohol derivatives instead of terminal alkynes to effectively increase
the yield [52, 53]. In 2018, Li and coworkers further used propionic acid derivatives
to realize ortho-C–H acylation and ipso alkynylation of iodobenzenes [54]. In 2019,
Dong also carried out ipso alkynylation when developing ortho C–H thiolation
reaction [39]. In 2022, Cheng realized the ortho C–H glycosylation merged with
ipso alkynylation [41].
Through ingenious substrate design, the ortho C–H amination and ipso
alkynylation have been developed by the Dong group for efficient synthesis of
polymers (Scheme 2.22) [55, 56]. At present, two types of polymerization modes
have been realized by the Dong group: (i) A2B2C polymerization, in which two
monomers (A2 and B2), each bearing two identical reactive groups, e.g. one
containing two iodides and the other containing two alkynyl groups, can undergo
copolymerization with the amine electrophile (C monomer); (ii) AB-C polymeriza￾tion, AB is a monomer with different active groups, one end being iodobenzene and
one end being alkyne, and AB monomer is used to copolymerize with the amine
electrophile (C monomer). For details, see Chapter 8.

important role in the synthesis of natural products and organic materials [57, 58].
The key step of its catalytic cycle is that the aryl Pd(II) intermediate is attacked by
phenylboric acid to obtain the diaryl Pd(II) intermediate, and then the target prod￾uct is obtained after reductive elimination. In the Pd/NBE chemistry, the resulting
aryl Pd(II) intermediate obtained after ortho C–H functionalization of iodobenzene
can also undergo Suzuki coupling with aryl boronic acids (Scheme 2.23) [59].

Scheme 2.23 Suzuki coupling and Pd/NBE chemistry.
Suzuki coupling is almost compatible with all currently developed ortho C–H
functionalization of iodobenzene, including C–H alkylation [59, 60], C–H arylation
[61], C–H amination [62], C–H carbonylation [33, 35, 63], C–H thiolation [39], and
C–H glycosylation [40, 41]. (See Scheme 2.24 for specific reaction conditions.)
2.3.3.2 Ipso C–H Arylation
Coupling of an aryl group to the ipso position could also be realized through C–H
arylation processes [64, 65]. Compared with the Suzuki coupling, C–H arylation
does not need arene substrates containing a boron group, thus potentially can be
more step economical. In the Pd/NBE chemistry, the intramolecular C–H arylation
reaction has been developed relatively mature and can be used to construct various
molecularskeletons,such asfused rings and heterocycles.(SeeChapter 1 for details.)
However, intermolecular ipso C–H arylation is still a challenge. At present,
only some heterocyclic arenes and polyfluoroaromatic hydrocarbons have been
used as the coupling partners. In 2015, the Zhou group achieved the ortho C–H
alkylation/ipso C–H arylation of various heterocycles (Scheme 2.25) [66]. The
reaction used NaOH as the base, and NaI as the additive to realize the ipso C–H
arylation of benzoxazole, oxazole, and thiophene ring, while other five-membered
heterocycles need CuBr and Cs2CO3 as the additive and base, respectively. It is
worth mentioning that when caffeine was used as an ipso functionalization reagent,
it was necessary to add stronger bases like LiOt
Bu and AgBF4 as an additive. This
is a unique catalytic condition in the Pd/NBE chemistry. In 2018, the Wu groupR

with Cs2CO3, assisted by the coordination of copper to stabilize the carbon anion.
The resulting aryl copper intermediate then undergoes transmetallation with the
Pd(II) intermediate and generates the final product through reductive elimination.
2.3.3.3 Decarboxylation Coupling Reaction
In 2017 and 2018, the Kwong group reported two cases of decarboxylative
intramolecular coupling reactions between benzoic acid and aryl or alkenyl Pd(II)
NBE intermediate, leading to different fused rings. For details, see Chapter 1
[69–71].
2.3.4 Alkylation Reaction
2.3.4.1 Coupling Reaction of Boron Reagents
Similar to the Suzuki coupling with aryl boronic acids, alkyl boronic acids, or
boronates can also undergo similar ipso alkylation reactions. However, the sub￾strate scope of ipso alkylation of alkyl boronic acids is narrow, which is limited to
allylation [62] and methylation [20] at present (Scheme 2.27). Among them, the
yield of allylation is low, only 20%. In addition, ortho C–H glycosylation can also
be compatible with ipso methylation [41]. In 2022, the Wang group discovered that
1,1-bis[(pinacolato)boryl]methane could also serve as an ipso alkylation reagent to
give benzyl boronate products, which can be further derivatized. [72]

2.3.4.2 Coupling Reaction of Germanium Reagents
Although only ipso allylation and methylation can be realized through coupling with
boron reagents, other ipso alkylation can be realized with the germanium reagents
by the Xiao group in 2020 (Scheme 2.28) [73, 74].Ligand 1
Scheme 2.28 Coupling reaction of germanium reagents.2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions 69
Palladium bromide was used as the catalyst, tri[3,5-di(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]
phosphine as a ligand, and Cs2CO3 as a base to realize the ortho C–H alkylation ipso
alkylation reaction of aryl iodides. The scope of substrates was wide, and various
alkyl groups from ethyl to long-chain alkanes (5a–5d, 5j) can be introduced into
the ipso position of aromatics. Alkyl boronates (5e) are compatible, facilitating
further derivatization of the product. Furthermore, this reaction can be extended
to complex aryl iodides, such as steroids (5f) and vitamin E. The reaction can
also undergo intramolecular ipso alkylation, resulting in the formation of 7- to
12-membered rings with yields ranging from 78% to 27% (as the ring size increased,
the yield decreased). In addition, similar ortho arylation ipso alkylation products
(5g–5i) can also be obtained. Finally, the ipso alkylation strategy can be further used
to construct natural products, e.g. Totarol.
2.3.4.3 Ipso Ketone 𝛂-Arylation
Due to the weak acidity of the proton at the α-position of ketones, ketone can
also serve as a nucleophiles for ipso functionalization under basic conditions
(Scheme 2.29) [75]. Ipso ketone α-arylation is compatible with the ortho-C–H alky￾lation, arylation, and amination of aryl iodides. Among these, ortho-C–H arylation
was the first such type of reaction developed. In 2009, the Catellani and Lautens
groups independently achieved intermolecular and intramolecular α-arylation
reactions, respectively. In the intermolecular reaction, phosphine ligands were
not employed and the product was generated from the dimerization of iodoben￾zene [76]. The intramolecular reaction used o-chlorophenone as an ortho-C–H
arylation and ipso alkylation reagent. The ketocarbonyl group in chlorobenzene is
an electron-withdrawing group, which facilitates its oxidative addition with ANP
intermediates, leading to selective ortho-C–H arylation. After NBE exclusion, the
ketone α-arylation occurs to form a polycyclic phenol product [77]. In 2016, the
ortho-C–H alkylation and ipso ketone α-arylation reactions were achieved, using
NaOH as a base. When less acidic acetonitrile was used as the coupling partner,
a stronger base, i.e. LiOtBu, was needed. [78] In 2017, the Kwong Group further
expanded the α-arylation of ketone to the ortho C–H amination, in which only
acetone was demonstrated as the coupling partner (Scheme 2.30) [79].
Scheme 2.29 Ipso ketone α-arylation.Scheme 2.30 Ortho-C–H functionalization.2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions 71
Note that except the α-arylation of ketones reported by Catellani in 2009, only
methyl ketones were used in other reports for intermolecular couplings. This may
be due to the high steric hindrance when α-site is a secondary or tertiary carbon.
However, the scope of the intramolecular α-arylation of ketone was not affected by
such a limitation. In 2017 and 2019, the Liang Group and the Zhou group indepen￾dently reported α-arylation reactions of tertiary and secondary alkyl ketones as the
coupling partners and achieved the synthesis of spiral and bridged rings [80, 81].
2.3.4.4 C–H Activation of Inert Alkyl Groups
In recent years, activation of inert C(sp3)—H bonds has been developed rapidly,
providing a powerful tool for the synthesis and modification of complex molecules.
In the field of Pd/NBE chemistry, only the intramolecular inert C(sp3)-H activation
was developed by Liang in 2018 to allow for ipso alkylation, and no intermolecular
reaction has been reported (Scheme 2.31) [11].
Scheme 2.31 C–H activation of inert alkyl groups.
The electrophilic reagent of the reaction is N-benzoyloxyamines, which gives
the ortho-C–H amination after NBE extraction to produce intermediate 6B with
bidentate coordination of the benzoate. The addition of a catalytic amount of PivOH
causes carboxylic acid exchange, and then CMD of the C(sp3)—H bond then occurs
mediated by the pivalate ligand. DFT calculations show that the Gibbs free energy
of intermediate 6C is lower than 6B, indicating that the carboxylic acid exchange is
thermodynamically favored. Moreover, the transition state (TS6-CMD2) of the C–H
activation by pivalate has a lower energy barrier. In 2022, the Zhang group further
realized a similar ipso C(sp3)-H activation termination of methyl pyrrole [82].
(See Chapter 6 for details.)
2.3.4.5 The C—C Bond Cleavage Reaction
In 2021, the Liang group reported the first case of C—C bond cleavage-enabled ipso
alkylation in Pd/NBE chemistry (Scheme 2.32). The reaction mechanism involves72 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization
the coordination of quaternary cyclobutanols with the aryl Pd(II) intermediates. The
β-carbon elimination process leads to the cleavage of the C—C bond, followed by
reductive elimination to produce the ipso alkylation products. In particular, the high
ring strain of the four-membered ring further promoted the ring-opening reaction.
The scope of electrophiles was wide and compatible with C–H alkylation, arylation,
and amination [83].
Scheme 2.32 The C—C bond cleavage reaction: (a) The C—C bond cleavage reaction
mechanism; (b) the scope of ortho C–H functionalization.
In 2022, the Zhou group developed the ipso allyl group reaction realized by another
type of β-carbon elimination process. This reaction gave a higher yield than using
allylboronic acid (up to 86% versus 20% with allylboronic acid, see Section 2.3.4.1)
[62] and a wide scope of substrates (Scheme 2.33) [84].
2.3.4.6 The 1,4-Pd Shift
In 2020, the Dong group realized a unique ortho C–H alkenylation ipso alkylation
through 1,4-Pd shift (Schemes 2.34 and 2.35) [85]. The reaction mechanism is
different from the classical Pd/NBE chemistry. First, Pd(0) undergoes oxidative
addition with iodobenzene and then migratory insertion with NBE to generate2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions 73
Scheme 2.33 Ipso allylation.
the key aryl-NBE-Pd (II) intermediate. Interestingly, this intermediate undergoes
1,4-Pd Shift, introducing a norbornyl group to the ipso position. The resulting ortho
palladated intermediate then undergoes Heck reaction to give the final product. In
this reaction, 2-trifluranyl phosphate (TFP) was added as ligand, lithium carbonate
as base, lithium bromide and BuBOTf as additives, and the maximum reaction yield
was 83%.
Scheme 2.34 The 1,4-Pd shift.
Scheme 2.35 Hydrogenation reaction.74 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization
2.3.5 Hydrogenation Reaction
Electron-donating substituents lead to ortho and para site-selectivity in
Friedel–Crafts and electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Conversely,
electron-deficient aromatics show low reactivity, albeit with positional selectivity at
the meta position. Therefore, the meta-C–H functionalization of aromatic hydro￾carbons has long been a challenge. Hydrogenation, as the ipso functionalization
in the Pd/NBE chemistry, can realize the synthesis of meta-substituted aromatics
(Scheme 2.35).
Hydrogenation reaction is often through the coordination of alcohol or other
hydride sources with the aryl Pd(II) intermediate, followed by the β-hydrogen
elimination process to generate the hydrogenation product and Pd(0) complex, and
the reaction cycle continues.
Due to its importance in organic synthesis, ipso hydrogenation in almost all
ortho functionalization reactions has been realized (Scheme 2.36). However,
the reagents for ipso hydrogenation are different. The most special case is the
ortho C–H alkylation, which uses isopropyl boric acid as the hydride source [86].
This may be due to nucleophilic substitution reactions between the commonly
used hydrogenation reagents, such as alcohols, and haloalkanes under the basic
conditions (this type of competitive reaction is shown in Section 2.2.2.2). The
ortho C–H aromatization uses benzyl alcohol [87] and DME [9] as the hydride
source, and it is worth mentioning that when all deuterated DME is used, the
ipso deuterized products can be obtained successfully. The ortho C–H amination
reaction of iodobenzene is carried out using isopropanol as an ipso hydrogena￾tion reagent, which is also one of the most commonly used hydrogenation
reagents at present [28]. The design of the ortho C–H acylation reagent is very
interesting. One side of the reagent is an electrophilic acylation reagent, and
the other side will generate isopropanol after CO2 removal to participate in the
hydrogenation reaction [35]. In addition, C–H glycosylation [41] and alkoxycar￾bonylation [37] reactions both used isopropanol to realize the ipso hydrogenation
reaction.
2.3.6 Cyanation Reaction
Aryl niters are commonly found in pharmaceuticals, agrichemicals and natu￾ral products. In addition, cyano group can be easily converted into amides. In
the Pd/NBE chemistry, ipso cyanation reactions often use K4[Fe(CN)6]•H2O,
Zn(CN)2, and CuCN as cynide sources. These metal cyanide salts can undergo
transmetallation with Pd(II) intermediates in the termination step of the cat￾alytic cycle, and then reductive elimination occurs to generate the target product
(Scheme 2.37).
At present, ortho C–H alkylation [88], arylation [88], amination [89, 90], carbony￾lation [91], and glycosylation [40] of iodobenzene have been shown to be compatible
with ipso cyanation (Scheme 2.38).Scheme 2.36 Ortho C–H functionalization.
2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions 7576 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization
Scheme 2.37 Cyanation reaction.
2.3.7 Borylation Reaction
In 2015, Ritter reported the first ipso borylation reaction, which uses Bis(pinacolato)
diboron (B2pin2) as the boron source (Scheme 2.39). The product of the reaction is
aryl boronate, which can be conveniently converted into various arene products with
different ipso substituents: (i) it can undergo Suzuki cross-coupling reaction with
benzyl chloride, iodobenzene and alkenyl bromide; (ii) it can form aryl azides with
sodium azide under the catalysis of copper acetate; (iii) it can react with hydrogen
peroxide to produce phenol derivatives; and (iv) it can react with sodium iodide,
copper chloride, or copper bromide to generate corresponding halogenated aromatic
derivatives [92].
In 2019, the Dong group developed ortho C–H acylation ipso borylation
during their synthesis of natural product acrelinone A using the Pd/NBE strategy
(Scheme 2.40). This method used benzoic anhydride as the C–H acylation reagent,
and B2pin2 as the borylation reagent (for details, see Chapter 8) [93].
2.3.8 The Construction of C—N Bond
The intramolecular ipso amination has been widely reported in the Pd/NBE
chemistry, of which the most common situations involve coupling with N—H
bonds and Pd (II) aryl intermediate [94]. Recently, there have also been some
examples of constructing the ipso C—N bond through N—C bond [95] or N—S
bond [96] cleavage reactions. Various heterocyclic molecules were formed using
these reactions, such as indole, tricyclic indole, carbazole, phenanthridine, and
phenanthridine (see Chapter 1 for details). However, the ipso amination via
intermolecular couplings has not been reported.
2.3.9 The Construction of C—O Bond
The construction of C—O bonds through ipso oxygenation is similar to the
amination, which is currently limited to intramolecular reactions (see Chapter 1 for
details) [97, 98].Scheme 2.38 Ipso cyanation with various ortho C–H functionalization.

Scheme 2.39 Borylation reaction.
Scheme 2.40 Ortho C–H acylation.
2.3.10 The Construction of C—S or C—Se Bonds
In 2016, the Gu group realized the first ipso thiolation reaction of aryl iodides,
which used thioester as the ortho C–H carbonylation and ipso thiolation reagent
(Scheme 2.41) [99]. In the catalytic cycle, the ANP intermediate undergoes oxidative
addition with thioesters, and then reductive elimination gives an ortho-carbonylated
Pd(II) intermediate. After NBE extrusion, the Pd(II) coordinates with the sulfur
group, and the target product is generated by subsequent reductive elimination.
In 2018, the Gu group expanded this reaction to ipso selenylation, in which ortho
C–H alkoxycarbonylation can also be realized [100]. In 2023, the Sun group2.3 Type of Ipso Functionalization Reactions 79
achieved ortho C–H alkoxycarbonylation/ipso thiolation and constructed alkyl
2-(phenylthio)benzoate derivatives [101]. In addition, the Liang group used this
strategy to realize ipso thiolation/selenylation and C–H glycosylation in 2021 [102].

carbonylation/alkoxycarbonylation and ipso selenylation; (d) ortho C–H carbonylation and
ipso thio/selenoglycosylation.
In 2021, the Dai group used phenylthioester instead of iodobenzene as the
substrate to realize ortho C–H alkylation ipso thiolation through a decarboxylation
process (Scheme 2.42) [103]. The mechanism of this reaction involves oxidative
addition Pd(0) with phenylthioester and then decarboxylation to generate the
thiol-coordinated Pd(II) aryl intermediate. This intermediate undergoes ortho C–H
alkylation with benzyl bromide assisted by smNBE 3. Finally, the thiolate palla￾dium intermediate undergoes reductive elimination to obtain the ipso thiolation
products. It is worth noting that the addition of olefins leads to ipso alkenylation
reactions.
2.3.11 Ipso Iodination
Ipso iodination is a challenging transformation because the aryl Pd(II) iodide inter￾mediate was considered difficult to undergo reductive elimination (Scheme 2.43).
Additionally, the resulting product, iodobenzene, is prone to react with Pd(0). In
2023, the Della Ca’ research group achieved a milestone by successfully conduct￾ing the first ipso iodination reaction, allowing for further derivatizations of the aryl
iodide product [104].80 2 Diverse Ipso Arene Functionalization

Scheme 2.43 Ipso iodination.
2.4 Prospects and Challenges of Ipso Functionalization
With the rapid development of the Pd/NBE chemistry, a variety of ipso functionaliza￾tion reactions have been realized. For example, in the alkenylation reaction,selective
synthesis of β- and α-functionalized alkenes can be achieved through the Heck reac￾tion and carbene-insertion reaction, and even allenylation reaction can be realized.
The Suzuki coupling allowed for the ipso arylation. In addition, taking advantage of
the germanium reagents, C—C bond cleavage, and ketone α-arylation processes, a
variety of ipso alkylation reactions have been realized. Moreover, hydrogenation has
promoted the Pd/NBE chemistry to become a convenient and reliable method for
the synthesis of meta-substituted aromatics. Furthermore, the derivatization of the
ipso borylation and iodination products enables the introduction of many reactive
functional groups, such as azide and halogen.References 81
However, a number of challenges still exist for the ipso functionalization
reactions:
1) Many ipso functionalization reactions can only be realized in an intramolecular
fashion. In contrast, the corresponding intermolecular reactions have not been
realized:
(a) The intramolecular C—N and C—O bond coupling reactions have been
reported, but no intermolecular-related reactions have been reported.
(b) The intramolecular ipso functionalization using aldehydes and ester groups
as the coupling partners has been reported, but no such intermolecular reac￾tions have been reported.
(c) The intramolecular inert C(sp3)—H bond arylation reaction has been
reported, but no such intermolecular reactions have been reported.
(d) Decarboxylative coupling has been used as an ipso functionalization reaction
in the intramolecularsetting, but no such intermolecularreactions have been
reported.
2) Germanium reagents have solved the problem of ipso alkylation to a large extent.
These reagents are difficult to synthesize due to the cost. More economical ipso
alkylation should be further developed.
3) Ipso borylation and iodination reactions are very versatile transformations, but
their scopes are not as general as other ipso functionalization so far.
4) The ipso functionalization to introduce other elements, such as silicon, has not
been realized. The silyl group generally prefers to undergo reductive elimination
at the NBE side afterthe transmetallation. Therefore, a new catalytic cycle design
is needed to realize the ipso silylation.

Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the
Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
Xin Liu and Guangbin Dong
University of Chicago, Department of Chemistry, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL, USA
3.1 Introduction
Compared to the traditional cross-coupling reactions, the palladium/norbornene
(Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis, though using the same type of substrates, features
the unique ortho C—H activation in addition to the ipso functionalization [1].
Meanwhile, compared to the conventional C—H functionalization methods [2], the
Pd/NBE catalyzed ortho C—H functionalization is both completely site-selective
and directing group-free. As described in Chapter 1, ortho functionalization is
realized through a selective reaction between an external electrophile and an
electron-rich aryl-norbornyl-palladacycle (ANP) intermediate (Scheme 3.1a).
Given that the Pd(0) in this catalytic cycle is also electron rich and susceptible to
oxidation, the key challenge for ortho C—H functionalization is how to design
an electrophile that selectively reacts with the ANP rather than the Pd(0). One
dilemma is that the Pd(0) should undergo faster oxidative addition with the
aryl halide substrate than the external electrophile, whereas the ANP needs
to favor the reaction with the electrophile instead of the aryl halide substrate.
Hence, the reactivity of the Pd(0), the ANP, the aryl halide substrate, and the
electrophile needs to be carefully balanced in order to realize successful vicinal
difunctionalization.
Owing to this substantial challenge, the development of ortho C—H function￾alization has been much slower than the ipso functionalization (see Chapter 2)
from the historical perspective (Scheme 3.1b) [3]. The seminal work of Catellani
and coworkers in 1997 first introduced the concept of ortho alkylation [1a]. Subse￾quently, the same group in 2001 achieved a breakthrough with ortho arylation [4]. To
introduce noncarbon-based functionalization, it was until 2013 that the Dong group
developed the ortho amination, opening the door for utilizing heteroatom-based
electrophiles [5]. Later, ortho acylation was independently discovered by the group
of Liang [6], Dong [7], and Gu [8] in 2015. This momentum continued with Gu90 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

Scheme 3.1 The Pd/NBE catalysis and the development of electrophiles.
[9] and Dong [10] who unveiled ortho thiolation independently in 2019. Most
recently, Dong and coworkers [11] achieved the ortho oxygenation by designing a
new class of oxygen-based electrophiles in 2023. These discoveries have led to the
further development of various synthetically useful methods, which have resulted
in unique applications.
Three mechanisms could be possible for the oxidative addition of ANP with
electrophile (E–Y) (Scheme 3.2): a. direct electrophilic substitution, b. concerted
oxidative addition, and c. SN2-type oxidative addition. Typically, the pathway
involving a Pd(IV) intermediate (paths b and c) is widely accepted for the Pd/NBE
catalysis, whereas the electrophilic substitution mechanism (path a) has received
little support or evidence. A number of experimental and computational efforts
support the SN2-type oxidative addition [12] mechanism in ortho alkylation,
amination and oxygenation reactions, and the concerted oxidative addition (path
b) is more commonly proposed for ortho arylation and acylation [13]. Therefore,
the mechanism for the ortho functionalization depends on the reaction model and
electrophile employed.
In this chapter, a detailed overview of various ortho C—H functionalization
reactions facilitated by the Pd/NBE catalysis is provided [14]. It is structured
according to the coupling element introduced by the ortho functionalization,
categorized as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. Meta C—H chlorination and
alkynylation, enabled by ortho C—H palladation, are discussed in Chapter 5. Given
the nice comprehensive discussion of the Pd/NBE-catalyzed annulation chemistry
in Chapter 1, this chapter will exclude annulation reactions, unless the electrophile
employed in such a reaction is introduced for the first time.3.2 Carbon-Electrophile 91

In 1997, Catellani et al. achieved the pioneering ortho alkylation by the Pd/NBE
cooperative catalysis, employing alkyl iodides as electrophiles and terminal
olefins for ipso functionalization (Scheme 3.3) [1a]. It allows preparation of 1,2,3-
trisubstituted arenes through a double ortho C—H functionalization of para￾substituted aryl iodides. Notably, the reaction was conducted at room temperature,
representing a considerably milder condition compared to other reactions
developed later.

Subsequently, different ortho alkylation reactions were developed with different
substrates, electrophiles, and termination reagents (Scheme 3.4). In 1999, Catellani
and Cugini used ortho-substituted aryl iodides as the substrates to achieve mono
ortho alkylation [15]. In 2006, Lautens and coworkers expanded the reaction scope
to heteroarenes[16]. With ipso Heck functionalization, coupling with different alkyl
iodide electrophiles was developed by Liu [17], Gu [19], and Wilson [18]. Besides
alkyl iodides, alkyl bromides and chlorides were found to work well, along with
different termination reactions, like Suzuki–Miyaura coupling [20], heteroarylation
[22], enolate coupling [33], carbene insertion [21], hydrogenation [23, 24]), cyana￾tion [25], Sonogashira coupling [26–28], and coupling by alkyl-germanium reagents
[29]. Furthermore, an asymmetric attempt for ortho alkylation and ipso arylation
was finished by Gu and coworkers in 2018 [30]. In 2020, the Cheng group [31]
and the Liang group [32] independently reported the ortho-C—H glycosylation – a
special type of alkylation reaction. Glycosyl chlorides were employed as the optimal
reagents, which were converted to the oxocarbeniumion intermediate serving the
real electrophile.
The first alkylation with aryl bromide substrates was achieved by Dong and
coworkers in 2018 [34]. The less reactive benzylic chlorides worked better in the
reaction (Scheme 3.5a). When alkyl bromides were used as the electrophiles,
the electron-rich tri-n-butylphosphine was found to be a better ligand to afford
good yield (Scheme 3.5b). These two examples imply a general trend for the ortho
alkylation reaction: less reactive substrates require less reactive electrophiles.
A series of experiments with enantioenriched substrates were carried out by
Lautens and coworkers, which gave insights into the mechanism of the oxidative
addition with ANP (Scheme 3.6). The intramolecular reactions gave stereoinversion
with slightly decreased enantiomeric excess (ee) [35]. These experiments suggest
that an SN2-type oxidative addition is more likely for the reaction between alkyl
halides and ANP, as the following reductive elimination typically proceeds with the
retention of stereochemistry (Scheme 3.7).

and Phenyltrimethylammonium Salt

reported the ortho methylation of aryl bromides with 4-nitrobenzenesulfonate
instead of methyl bromide that is a toxic gas (Scheme 3.8a) [34]. Also, in 2020,
the same group applied phenyltrimethylammonium salt as a mild electrophile for
achieving the ortho methylation with an alkenyl triflate substrate (Scheme 3.8b)
[36]. In 2020, they further achieved the ortho methylation of aryl iodides using
the phenyltrimethylammonium salt when addressing the “meta constraint” in the
Pd/NBE catalysis (Scheme 3.8c) [37].

In 2024, Chen, Huang, and coworkers reported the ortho C—H methylation
and ipso alkenylation of aryl triflates, employing 4-methylbenzenesulfonate as the
electrophile (Scheme 3.9b) [39]. This approach shares the same norbornene (N2) as
the conditions established in Zhou’s work (Scheme 3.9a).
3.2.1.3 Annulation Using 2H-Azirines
Upon heating or treatment with transition-metal catalysts, highly strained
2H-azirines are known to undergo ring-opening to form a 1,3-dipole species [40].
In 2010, Lautens and coworker demonstrated that the resulting active 1,3-dipole
species could react with ANP, followed by C—N bond formation at the ipso position
and then tautomerization to yield indole products (Scheme 3.10) [41]. More
substituted 2H-azirines or nonaryl-substituted ones were found not effective for
this transformation.3.2 Carbon-Electrophile 97

3.2.1.4 Alkylation Using Epoxides
Encouraged by the wide availability of epoxides, Dong and coworker hypothesized
that epoxides could react with ANP through an SN2 nucleophilic ring-opening under
the Pd/NBE catalysis. In 2017, they successfully demonstrated this transformation,
yielding 2,3-dihydrobenzofurans enabled by a catalytic amount (20 mol%) of iso￾propyl ester-substituted NBE (N4) and a Buchwald ligand-derived Pd pre-catalyst
(Scheme 3.11a) [42]. Notably, this transformation proceeds with stereoretention,
making it a valuable method for preparing chiral 2,3-dihydrobenzofurans from
enantiopure epoxides. The same group, later in 2018, developed an asymmetric
variant of this transformation with racemic epoxides, utilizing an enantiopure NBE
N4 (Scheme 3.11b) [43]. This represents the first example of chiral NBE-mediated
Pd(0)-initiated Catellani-type reactions.
Shortly after, Zhou and coworkers independently reported the ortho alkylation
reaction with epoxides in 2018, using a Heck reaction for ipso termination [44].
The resulting products could undergo a one-pot cyclization to form macrocycles
through Michael addition, facilitated by the addition of one more equivalent of
Cs2CO3 (Scheme 3.11c) [45].
3.2.1.5 Alkylation Using Aziridines
Aziridines, a strained N-heterocycle, are widely useful building blocksfor preparing
biologically active compounds [46]. In 2018, Liang and coworkers developed
the first Pd/NBE-catalyzed annulation reaction using aziridines as electrophiles,
resulting in various indolines in a single step from readily available aryl iodides98 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

reported the domino Catellani/Heck/aza-Michael addition reaction utilizing
aziridines to afford substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines (Scheme 3.12b) [48]. It is
noteworthy that both reactions can use a catalytic amount of norbornene.
3.2.1.6 Alkylation Using Ethers and TMSI
Ethers, commonly used as solvents, are known to react with trimethylsilyl iodide
(TMSI) to generate alkyl iodides in situ. In 2022, Liang and coworkers developed a
new reaction mode that utilizes ethersolvents asthe alkylation source (Scheme 3.13)
[49]. In thisreaction, the estersolvent was activated by TMSI to generate alkyl iodide
species as the real electrophiles. Various ipso termination reactions, such as Heck,3.2 Carbon-Electrophile 99

Suzuki–Miyaura, Sonogashira couplings, and hydrogenation, were all compatible
with this reaction system, which provide an alternative method for introducing an
alkyl group at the ortho position.
3.2.2 Ortho Arylation
Compared to the ortho alkylation reactions, ortho arylation presents greater
complexity due to various selectivity challenges encountered in this complicated
catalytic process. The use of ortho substituted aryl iodides as the substrate and aryl
bromides with an ortho electron-withdrawing group (EWG) as the electrophile
have been found to be highly beneficial for the ortho arylation, which are coined
as the “ortho effect” and chelating effect (Scheme 3.14). They are discussed in the
following subsections.
3.2.2.1 “Ortho Effect” in the Pd/NBE Catalysis
In 1985, Catellani and Chiusoli reported that the reaction of para-substituted aryl
bromides and NBE afforded two cyclized compounds A and B (Scheme 3.15) [50].
In 2011, Catellani, Derat, and coworkers conducted a computational study of this
reaction [51] and found that, for ortho unsubstituted substrates, instead of form￾ing the Pd(IV) species via oxidative addition, a transmetallation pathway is favored
to give intermediates C and D without selectivity, which then undergo reductive
elimination and then intramolecular C—H activation to give products A and B,
respectively. In contrast, for ortho-substituted substrates, the same mechanism to100 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

In 1998, Catellani and coworkers first unveiled that the ortho substituent in the
aryl substrate could promote the selective ortho arylation with NBE recycled [52],
which was later named as the “ortho effect.” Based on the computational study [51],
assisted by the ortho substituent, the oxidative addition with the ANP,sp2–sp2 reduc￾tive elimination, and β-carbon elimination are all favored to give the desired product
(Scheme 3.16).
On the other hand, the ortho substituent in the aryl substrates has been a critical
factor in the Pd/NBE catalysis. Without the ortho substituents, di-ortho functional￾ized products and/or the formation of NBE-attached side products can dominate,
leading to low yield and low selectivity. This limitation is called “ortho constraint,”
[53a] which is different from the ortho effect. The discussion of “ortho constraint”
and the solution with structurally modified NBEs [53] are presented in Chapter 7.
3.2.2.2 Arylation Using Aryl Halides
The first catalytic ortho arylation was documented by Catellani et al. in 2001
(Scheme 3.17) [4]. The reaction entailed a catalytic process involving a ring closure
with diphenyl- or alkylphenylacetylenes to give substituted phenanthrenes. The use102 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

of ortho-substituted aryl iodides was necessary, as the absence of ortho substitution
led to no desired product formation. In addition, bulky ortho substituents were
detrimental to this reaction, as they likely blocked the reaction of ANP with another
aryl iodide,resulting in a cyclobutane side-product with a yield of 78%. Interestingly,3.2 Carbon-Electrophile 103
dialkylacetylenes did not give any annulated product, instead forming the allene in
high yield, likely promoted by a favorable β–H elimination.
3.2.2.3 Homo Ortho Arylation
After the seminal work, Catellani and coworkers developed a series of homo￾coupling ortho arylation reactions with different ipso functionalization methods as
shown in Scheme 3.18. In addition to the Heck reaction [54] and Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling [55], other ipso terminations were also discovered, such as the redox-relay
Heck reaction [56], hydrogenation by benzyl alcohol [57], coupling with enolates
[58], and arylation via C—H activation [59].

3.2.2.4 Cross Ortho Arylation and the Chelating Effect
As aryl halides can function as both the substrates and the electrophiles, cross
couplings of two aryl halides via ortho arylation presents a selectivity challenge [60].104 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
Forinstance, the reaction between 2-iodotoluene and 2-iodoethylbenzene yielded all
four possible products, as expected (Scheme 3.19a). In 2004, Catellani and cowork￾ers found that the reaction between 2-iodotoluene and methyl o-iodobenzoate
only gave three products, with the di-ester being the major product [60]. This
result suggests the enhanced reactivity of methyl o-iodobenzoate as both the
substrate and the electrophile (Scheme 3.19b). Furthermore, successful isolation of
a single product was achieved using methyl o-bromobenzoate as the electrophile
(Scheme 3.19c). Subsequently, various substituted aryl bromides were tested under
the same conditions, revealing that the presence of an ortho chelating group or an
EWG can greatly facilitate the cross ortho arylation reaction (Scheme 3.19c). Such
“chelating effect” is particularly important for the desired selectivity in cross ortho
arylations.
Scheme 3.19 Development of the cross-coupling type ortho arylation. Source: Catellani
[60]/John Wiley & Sons.
In summary, three key points must be considered to achieve the selective cross
arylation reaction (Scheme 3.19): (i) the combination of an aryl iodide substrate3.2 Carbon-Electrophile 105
and an aryl bromide/chloride electrophile is crucial; (ii) an ortho chelating group
on the electrophile is important for the selectivity; (iii) the reaction benefits from
aryl electrophiles containing an EWG, though it is not necessary.
Inspired by these seminal studies, various cross ortho arylation reactions with
different ipso terminations have been developed. Examplesinclude ipso cyanation by
Lautens[61] and Suzuki–Miyaura coupling byCatellani[62](Scheme 3.20). Notably,
diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) was identified as a hydride source for ipso
hydrogenation, a finding corroborated by the deuterium labeling study [63]. Further￾more, the ortho arylation ipso hydrogenation was also achieved using 2-bromobenzyl
alcohol as a bifunctional reagent, employing a hydride transfer strategy to yield the
2-biaryl carbaldehyde products [64].

Ortho arylation with aryl chlorides as the electrophile has also been developed in
additional to aryl bromides. In 2009, Lautens and coworkers reported an interesting
cyclization reaction using 2′
-chloroacetophenone as an ambiphilic reagent, and
the reaction outcome depended on the addition of water (Scheme 3.21a) [65]. In
2017, Kwong, Lin, and coworkers disclosed a three-component cross-coupling
reaction involving aryl halides, 2-chloroarylcarboxylic acids, and norborna￾diene to synthesize polycyclic aromatic compounds (Scheme 3.21b) [66]. In
this reaction, the carboxylate group first serves as a chelating group to pro￾mote the ortho arylation and then undergoes decarboxylative coupling with the
norbornadiene.
3.2.2.5 Arylation Using Aryl Diazonium Salts
In addition to aryl halides, the scope of electrophiles for ortho arylation reactions
was recently extended to aryl diazonium salts by Fu et al. (Scheme 3.22) [67].106 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

Chemical Society.
The reaction required a stoichiometric amount of potassium iodide. Control
experiments revealed that aryl diazonium salts can be rapidly converted to the
corresponding aryl iodide even at room temperature, suggesting that it is possible
that the in situ-generated aryl iodide serves as the actual electrophile.3.2 Carbon-Electrophile 107
3.2.3 Ortho Acylation
C—H acylation of arenesserves as a mild and straightforward approach to introduce
carbonyl moieties into aromatic compounds. The exploration of new carbon-based
electrophiles allowed three (Liang, Dong, and Gu) groups to concurrently discover
the Pd/NBE-catalyzed ortho acylation reaction in 2015.
3.2.3.1 Acylation Using Acid (Mixed) Anhydrides, Acid Chlorides,
and Carboxylic Acids
Liang and coworkers utilized symmetrical acyl anhydrides as the electrophile to
achieve ortho acylation of aryl iodides with the Heck reaction for the ipso termina￾tion (Scheme 3.23) [6]. They found toluene was a more effective solvent for aliphatic
anhydrides, and less bulky reagents gave lower yield.
Scheme 3.23 Ortho acylation using symmetrical anhydrides. Source: Liang [6]/American
Chemical Society.
Dong and coworkers designed an isopropyl carbonate-based anhydride, which
served as both an acyl electrophile and a hydride source to facilitate the ortho
acylation ipso hydrogenation reaction (Scheme 3.24) [7]. Mechanistically, the
reaction relies on the selective oxidative addition of ANP with the anhydride at the
benzoylside ratherthan the isopropylside. Afterthe reductive elimination and NBE
extrusion, the resulting aryl Pd(II) species then undergoes decarboxylation, β-H
elimination, and C−H reductive elimination to yield the ortho acylation product.
Gu and coworkers accomplished the ortho acylation reaction using acyl chlorides
as the coupling partner (Scheme 3.25) [8]. It was proposed that acyl chlorides
were in situ converted to the corresponding anhydrides, which served as the actual
electrophiles. They observed that the reaction did not proceed well under anhydrous
conditions, which underscores the critical role of H2O in this transformation.
Besides hydrogenation and alkenylation, several other types of ipso terminations
have been realized with ortho acylation chemistry (Scheme 3.26). First, the
preliminary study of the ipso Suzuki–Miyaura quench was reported by Liang [6]
and Dong [7] independently in 2015. Later, systematic development of the ortho
acylation ipso Suzuki–Miyaura coupling was accomplished using aromatic acyl108 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

arylation [69], cyanation [70], alkynylation [71], and intramolecular alkenylation
[72] have been achieved. It is noteworthy that the ortho acylation can also work
using the combination of aromatic or aliphatic acids and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC), with the actual electrophiles being anhydride species [73]. In the same year,3.2 Carbon-Electrophile 109

3.2.3.2 Carboxylation Using Thioesters and Selenides
In 2016, Gu and coworkersreported an ortho acylation reaction utilizing thioesters as
the bifunctional reagents to synthesize 2-(arylthio)aryl ketones (Scheme 3.27a) [76].
Their work represents a new type of reaction mode. The C(O)—S bond of thioesters110 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
is cleaved by the ANP, followed by selective C—C bond reductive elimination to
realize the ortho acylation. Subsequently, the resulting palladium-thiolate species
undergoes the β-C elimination and C—S reductive elimination to furnish the ipso
thiolation.

Chemical Society, (b) Gu [77]/American Chemical Society.
Two years later, the same group developed the related ortho acylation ipso selena￾tion via cleaving theC(O)—Se bond for preparing α-carbonylselanes(Scheme 3.27b)
[77]. A variety of alkyl and arylselenoatesserved assuitable coupling partnersin this
reaction system.
3.2.3.3 Alkoxycarbonylation and Aminocarbonylation
The scope of ortho acylation was broadened to include alkoxycarbonyl and
aminocarbonyl groups through the development of novel electrophiles. In 2016,
Dong and coworkers reported the ortho alkoxycarbonylation and aminocar￾bonylation reactions for introducing ester and amide moieties to the aromatic
substrates. They devised a mixed-anhydride reagent featuring a bulky aryl group,3.2 Carbon-Electrophile 111
which effectively suppressed the “normal” reactivity of cleaving the acyl—O bond
by the ANP, allowing for the selective cleavage of the O—alkoxycarbonyl bond
(Scheme 3.28) [78]. By tethering the anhydride reagent with an olefin, they success￾fully obtained several macrolactone products without the need for high dilution.
Following the same approach, the same group also obtained the preliminary result
regarding the ortho aminocarbonylation.
Scheme 3.28 Ortho alkoxycarbonylation and aminocarbonylation reactions. Source: Dong
[78]/Elsevier.
In 2016, Jiao and coworkers achieved the ortho aminocarbonylation ipso
intramolecular C—H arylation reaction by employing aryl carbamoyl chlorides as
the electrophiles (Scheme 3.29) [79]. This reaction yielded various phenanthridi￾nones as the primary products, tolerating alkyl or aryl substitutions on the nitrogen
atom. Notably, when utilizing the allyl-substituted carbamoyl chloride, the ipso
Heck reaction was favored.
In 2018, Gu expanded their ortho acylation ipso selenation (Scheme 3.27b)to intro￾duce alkoxycarbonyl groups under the same catalytic condition (Scheme 3.30) [77].
In 2022, Dong and coworker developed the ortho-carbamoylation ipso-functionali￾zation of alkenyl triflatesto access poly-substituted acrylamides, in which carbamoyl
chlorides were used asthe electrophile (Scheme 3.31)[80].In thisreaction, the struc￾turally modified amide NBE (N9) and phosphafluorene ligand (L1) played critical
roles[53]. Alkenylsulfonates were conveniently prepared in one step or one pot from
the corresponding ketones. Various nucleophiles, such as hydride, olefin, alkyne,
and boronic acid, can be used for the ipso termination. The use of allyl-substituted112 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

electrophile enabled a tandem intramolecular ipso Heck and C(sp2)–H annulation
to construct a 6-6-5-6 tetracycle in high efficiency.
3.3 Nitrogen-Electrophile
3.3.1 Ortho Amination
From 1997 to 2012, the electrophile scope of the Pd/NBE catalysis had been
limited to carbon-based ones. Considering the prevalence of arylamines in
pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals, analogous to the breakthrough from the3.3 Nitrogen-Electrophile 113

Suzuki–Miyaura coupling to the Buchwald−Hartwig amination, the realization of
the Pd/NBE-catalyzed ortho amination would be highly attractive.
3.3.1.1 Amination Using N-Benzoyloxyamines
In 2013, Dong and Dong reported the first Pd/NBE-catalyzed ortho amination
reaction of aryl iodides (Scheme 3.32a) [5]. The reaction features an ortho
amination−ipso hydrogenation cascade, introducing a dialkylamino group
to the ortho-position of the arene and a hydrogen atom to the ipso position.
N-Benzoyloxyamines were employed as the electrophile, with isopropanol acting
as the hydride source, which was confirmed by the deuterium-labeling study. The
mechanism of this reaction was later studied by Liu, Dong et al. [12a] and Wu,
Zhang, Sun et al. [12b] through experiments and density-functional theory (DFT)
calculations, which supports an SN2-type oxidative addition between the ANP and
the amine electrophile (Scheme 3.32b).
Since 2013, the ortho amination reaction has been extensively investigated by
a number of research groups. The robust nature of this reaction allows tolerance
of diverse nucleophiles for ipso functionalization, as summarized in Scheme 3.33,
making the ortho amination reaction a versatile transformation. For instance,
different alkenes can be incorporated via the ipso Heck reactions [81–83], as well
as through allenylation [84] and carbene insertion reactions [85]. Additionally,
successful outcomes have been achieved in ipso arylation [86], alkynylation [87, 88],
cyanation [89, 90], and borylation [91]. Furthermore, ipso alkylation reactions114 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

Society.
have been demonstrated using the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling [18, 92], acetone
enolate coupling [93], retro-allylation [94], and β-carbon elimination of tertiary
alcohols [95].
In the past decade, while the nucleophile (ipso termination) scope of the ortho
amination reaction has been significantly broadened, the amine groups that can
be introduced have been primarily limited to tertiary amino moieties. Aiming to
further expand the scope of the amine electrophiles, in 2024, Dong and coworkers
discovered that certain mono-N-alkyl amino groups can be installed to the arene
ortho position under carefully balanced reaction conditions (Scheme 3.34) [96].
While mono-N-tertiary alkyl amine-derived electrophiles were most effective,
preliminary success with a secondary N-alkyl amino group was also achieved.
The reaction benefits from an electron-deficient phosphine ligand (L2) and a
C2-substituted NBE mediator (N10). Note that one advantage of the tertiary alkyl
substituents on the nitrogen is the ease of their removal, leading to primary amino
groups that can be converted to various interesting N-heterocycles.
3.3.1.2 Amination Using Dialkylamino Carbonates
Besides the N-benzoyloxyamines, O-morpholino or -piperidinyl carbonates (R1 or
R2) have also been developed as effective electrophiles for the ortho amination.
In 2021, Dong and coworkers developed a carbonyl 1,2-transposition method
through an enolate triflation, Pd/NBE-catalyzed enamine formation, and hydrolysis3.3 Nitrogen-Electrophile 115

cascade (Scheme 3.35) [97]. The crucial enamine intermediate was generated
through the ortho amination ipso hydrogenation of alkenyl triflates or nonaflates,
which was facilitated by the difunctional carbonate reagents (R1 or R2) and a
C2-amide-substituted NBE mediator (N11). This carbonyl transposition method
enables rapid access to unconventional bioactive analogs through late-stage
functionalization.
3.4 Sulfur-Electrophile
3.4.1 Ortho Thiolation
3.4.1.1 Thiolation Using Aryl or Alkyl Thiosulfonates
In 2019, Gu and coworker unveiled an ortho thiolation reaction utilizing thio￾sulfonate reagents as the electrophile (Scheme 3.36) [9]. The essential selective
reductive elimination of the Pd(IV) intermediate to form the ortho C(Ar)—SR
bond was attributed to a proposed tautomerization of the sulfonate ligand dur￾ing the reaction. This method proved effective for incorporating various aryl or
alkyl thiol groups, including forming secondary aliphatic thioethers. The ipso
functionalization in this work only included the Heck termination.
3.4.1.2 Thiolation Using Aryl or Alkyl Sulfenamides
Concurrently in the same year, building on their design logic of the ortho amina￾tion reactions, Dong and coworkers devised a sulfenamide electrophilic reagent,
enabling successful ortho thiolation reactions of aryl iodides (Scheme 3.37) [10].
Their approach was first based on the electronegativity difference between N and
S, akin to that between O and N in the amination electrophile. Furthermore,
analogous to the directing influence of the benzoyl group, the presence of an3.5 Oxygen-Electrophile 117

amide carbonyl was expected to aid the oxidative addition of ANP. Notably,
seven-membered sulfenamides with an adjacent tert-butyl group proved to be more
effective, possibly due to their longer N—S bond compared to other counterparts.
Both aryl and alkyl sulfenamides are suitable electrophiles. Moreover, different ipso
termination reactions, such as olefination, arylation, and alkynylation, worked well
in producing poly-substituted aromatic sulfur compounds.
3.5 Oxygen-Electrophile
3.5.1 Ortho Alkoxylation
Compared to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, which are typically considered as
softer elements, the introduction of harder elements, such as oxygen, to the ortho
position of arene constitutes a substantial challenge. This is because oxygen-based
electrophiles are typically strong oxidants, which are generally not compatible with
Pd(0). To address this challenge, in 2023, Dong and coworkers designed a new type
of oxygen-electrophiles (O–electrophile) based on a polarity-reversed N–O reagent
[11] (Scheme 3.38). Unlike the N–O reagents used in the ortho amination reaction,
the installation of two EWGs on the N reversed the polarity of the N—O bond,118 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

making it an excellent O–electrophile. The increased sterics on the N side were
anticipated to inhibit the concerted oxidative addition with Pd(0), whereas having
a larger leaving group should not affect its SN2 reaction with ANP.
Scheme 3.38 The design of the polarity-reversed N–O reagents for the ortho alkoxylation.
Based on this hypothesis, Dong, Liu, and coworkersrevealed the first ortho alkoxy￾lation reaction enabled by a unique N,N-bissulfonylmethoxyamine electrophile and
C7-bromo-substituted NBE (N13) (Scheme 3.39) [11]. Different nucleophiles, such
as olefin, hydride, and alkyne, can be used for ipso functionalization. In addition
to aryl iodides, different aryl bromides also reacted smoothly to afford the desired
products, enabled by the use of bis(2-diphenylphosphinophenyl)ether (DPEPhos)
as the ligand and KI as the additive. This “iodide additive” effect indicated that an
iodide anion is likely involved in the key step of the reaction. Note that, besides
methoxy group, ethoxy group can also be installed, albeit at a lower yield. The ortho
oxygenation method was then demonstrated to be capable of streamlining the syn￾thesis of complex bioactive compounds and accessing challenging benzenoid sub￾stitution patterns, including penta- and hexa-substituted ones.
Further, they conducted the DFT calculationsto understand the processinvolving
oxidative addition of ANP (Scheme 3.40) [11]. The computational study indicates
that an SN2-type oxidative addition of the electrophile with ANP is most favorable.
Among several possible ANP species(a–c), the anionic one (b), containing an iodide
ligand and a bis(2-pyridyl)phenylphosphine (L3) ligand, gave the lowest activation
barrier. This observation aligns with the aforementioned “iodide additive” effect.
3.6 Conclusion and Outlook
In summary, this chapter offers an overview of the ortho C—H functionalization
by the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis. To date, four elements, including carbon,
nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen, can be introduced during the ortho functionalization.120 3 Diverse Ortho C—H Functionalization by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

Nature.
These ortho functionalizations are enabled by the careful choice or innovative
design of the electrophiles that are compatible with the catalytic system. Each
development of a new type of ortho functionalization has led to various new
synthetic methods, new capabilities, and new applications, which renders the
Pd/NBE catalysis a valuable tool for synthetic chemists.
While significant progress on the ortho functionalization has been made, sub￾stantial space and opportunities remain in this field for further advancement. First,
compared to the cross couplings and C—H activation reactions, the scope of the
electrophilesfor the Pd/NBE catalysis has a large room to expand. Introducing more
kinds of heteroatoms, such as fluorine (F), boron (B), and silicon (Si), would be
highly attractive to access more diverse products. Second, milderreaction conditions
and more efficient catalysts are still needed, which would enhance the practicality of
these methods on large scales. Third, a deeper mechanistic understanding would be
beneficial for designing new Pd/NBE-catalyzed transformations and better catalyst
systems. As an outlook, future endeavors are expected to further push the bound￾aries of Pd/NBE catalysis, making it a suite of highly versatile methods for the rapid
functionalization of aromatic and other organic compounds.References 121

4.1 Introduction
Palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperatively catalyzed reaction (also known as
the Catellani reaction) enables the ipso- and ortho- functionalization of aryl halides
and has been extensively studied through various experimental and theoretical
methods, thereby ensuring the effective syntheses of polysubstituted arenes. Since
its initial discovery in 1997 by the Catellani group [1], a series of Pd/NBE-promoted
reactions with varieties of electrophiles such as alkyl/aryl halides, epoxides,
and aziridines, and different types of termination reagents like olefins, alkynes,
and boronic acids have been developed (see Chapters 2 and 3) [2]. Through
this step-economic reaction, many important structures, including isochromans,
dihydrobenzofurans, biaryl atropisomers, and so on can be constructed, which are
extremely essential in many bioactive alkaloids [3], pharmaceuticals [4], and chiral
ligands [5].
The generally accepted mechanism for the Catellani reaction is as below: the
procedure starts with the oxidative addition of aryl iodides to a palladium(0)
catalyst (Scheme 4.1a), followed by NBE migratory insertion and ortho C—H
bond activation to generate the aryl-norbornyl-palladacycle (ANP) complex. The
ANP complex is then oxidized by electrophiles, forming a Pd(IV) complex (M-2).
Subsequently, a cascade process involving reductive elimination and coupling with
appropriate terminating reagents occurs, leading to the final product.
Based on the mechanism outlined earlier, chiral elements can be introduced (or
created) in molecules during one of the steps in this catalytic process. Theoretically,
there are three main strategies that can be applied for asymmetric synthesis via
palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis (Scheme 4.1b). (i) Chiral substrates
were used, and usually the chirality can be well retained in the transformation.
(ii) Stereochemistry can be controlled during the termination step of a steri￾cally hindered arylpalladium species (M-3). This process is similar to the classic
palladium-catalyzed asymmetric transformation using organic halides or pseudo130 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

catalytic cycle of Catellani-type reactions; (b) setreoselective steps in the reaction.4.2 Stereochemistry Controlled by the Substrate 131
halides. In this mode, chiral phosphines or phosphoramidites can be chosen as
ligands for stereo-induction. Alternatively, the stereochemistry can be controlled
by the chiral catalyst that only interacts with the termination reagent. (iii) Chiral
norbornene can be used to control the stereochemistry. Firstly, in the prechiral or
racemic substrates, the C–H palladation step is often reversible. The stereoselective
reaction occurs downstream when using a chiral norbornene. Secondly, the chiral
ANP intermediate M-1b can distinguish the two enantiomers of a racemic elec￾trophile, enabling kinetic resolution. Thirdly, the chiral ANP intermediate M-1b
can react with an arylhalide. The oxidative addition of M-1b with an arylhalide
can be stereoselective when the arylhalide is a racemic reagent. Alternatively, the
reductive elimination of M-4b can produce palladium intermediate M-5 containing
an axially chiral biaryl skeleton. These strategies not only enable the Catellani
reaction to efficiently construct stereogenic centers but also provide alternative
ways for the synthesis of complex molecules with axial or planar chirality.
4.2 Stereochemistry Controlled by the Substrate
Being the first developed method to achieve asymmetric synthesis of chiral, multi￾substituted aromatic ringsthrough the Catellanireaction, utilizing a chiralsubstrate
is a promising approach to tackle this challenge. However, finding the appropriate
enantio-enriched substrate (typically electrophiles) can be a difficult task. Secondary
alkyl iodides, epoxides, and aziridines are commonly suitable options for this pro￾cess. Enantioselectivity of the desired products can be acquired through either an
intramolecular or intermolecular chirality transfer process.
4.2.1 Intramolecular Chirality Transfer
In 2007, Lautens and coworkers pioneered the synthesis of chiral benzo-fused
heterocycles through palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis, using aryl
iodides that were tethered with an enantio-enriched secondary alkyl iodide
(Scheme 4.2) [6]. Optimal reaction conditions involved a catalytic amount of
Pd(OAc)2, PPh3, and super-stoichiometric norbornene in a solution of 1,2-
dimethoxyethane (DME) under microwave irradiation. As a result, the annulation
of (S)-3 and (R)-5 afforded the corresponding bicyclic and tricyclic products with
almost no loss of stereochemical information. However, it was observed that the
efficiency of the chirality transfer was significantly influenced by the tethered
heteroatom. For example, the annulation of sulfonamide (R)-7 resulted in an
erosion of enantiomeric excess (ee) in the product (R)-8 due to the anchimeric
assistance of the nitrogen atom. By comparing the configuration of (R)-7 with the
derivative of (R)-8, it was determined that a configuration inversion occurred during
the annulation reaction. These results suggested that the oxidative addition of ANP
with alkyl iodides likely proceeded through an SN 2-type reaction (M-6 → M-7).132 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

4.2.2 Intermolecular Chirality Transfer
In 2015, Lautens and coworkers expanded the transformation to intermolecular
ortho alkylation reaction between aryl iodides and secondary chiral alkyl iodides.
Solvents had a significant impact on the chiral transfer efficiency (Scheme 4.3) [7].
The conversion of aryl iodides to highly congested 1,2,3-trisubstituted aromatic
compounds was achieved smoothly with a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2 and a
stoichiometric amount of NBE. When iodide 10 was introduced into the reaction
with MeCN as a solvent, the corresponding product was obtained in 53% yield
while retaining the ee value. However, when the reaction was performed in DMF,
racemization was observed, and only 40% ee left. This observation is likely that free
iodide ion can racemize optically active alkyl iodides in the polar DMF solvent.
Based on the previous synthesis of tetrasubstituted helical alkenes [8], Lautens
and coworkers further investigated the asymmetric version of this reaction
(Scheme 4.4) [9]. Bromoalkyl alkynes bearing a stereogenic center (16) were used4.2 Stereochemistry Controlled by the Substrate 133

to synthesize helical alkenes (18) with moderate diastereoselectivity. This modular
process achieved helical chirality by favoring a more stable intermediate M-9 (than
M-8) and the relying on norbornene as the reactant in a stereoselective manner
with exclusive exo-facial selectivity.
Scheme 4.4 Synthesis of helical alkenes.
With an ortho (hetero)aryl ring as the termination group, Lautens and coworkers
further synthesized sterically crowded tetrasubstituted helical alkenes (20) without
the incorporation of norbornene moiety (Scheme 4.5) [10].134 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
Scheme 4.5 Chiral helical alkenes constructed via domino-Catellani reaction.
In 2013, a Pd-catalyzed norbornene-mediated reaction was chosen as a key step
in Lautens’ synthesis of (+)-linoxepin. (Scheme 4.6) [11]. By applying optically pure
iodolactone (22) and functionalized aryliodide (21), multisubstituted benzene 23 (ee
was not given directly in the article) could be obtained in a good yield, enabling an
efficient and step-economic total synthesis of (+)-linoxepin.
Scheme 4.6 Total synthesis of (+)-linoxepin via Catellani reaction as the key step.
In addition to chiral alkyl iodides, enantiopure epoxides and aziridines
are readily accessible, and can serve as excellent chiral coupling partners in
Pd/norbornene-catalyzed reactions. The proposed catalytic cycle for the reactions
involving epoxides and aziridines is listed in Scheme 4.7. The ANP nucleophilic
attacks the less-hindered carbon of the chiral reactant, and full chirality retention
was observed in intermediate M-14. Norbornene extrusion would then deliver
M-15, which can be terminated with intramolecular cyclization or intermolecular
trapping with alkene, alkyne, etc.
In 2017, Dong group reported a palladium/norbornene-catalyzed annulation
reaction of aryliodides with optically active epoxides (Scheme 4.8a) [12a]. Chiral
2,3-dihydrobenzofurans can be obtained in high yields with full retention of the
ee values. In this study, only a catalytic amount of NBE (N1) was required. In
2018, Zhou and coworkers described a similar strategy for the synthesis of chiral
2,3-dihydrobenzofurans (Scheme 4.8b) [12b].
In 2018, Zhou and coworkers utilized chiral epoxides as bifunctional alkylating
reagents in the Catellani reaction (Scheme 4.9a) [13]. This reaction employed4.2 Stereochemistry Controlled by the Substrate 135

Scheme 4.9 Synthesis of benzo-fused heterocycles: (a) olefins as electrophiles to offer
DBFs; (b) alkynes were used as electrophiles to realize divergent transformation.
In 2019, the Zhou Group replaced the olefins with alkynes to serve as
the terminating reagents in the epoxide-involved Catellani-type reactions,
thus developing a three-component Catellani reaction of aryl iodides, chiral
epoxides, and terminal alkynes (Scheme 4.9b) [14]. As a result, the assembly of
ortho-2′
-hydroxyalkyl-substituted phenylacetylenes (35) was accomplished with the
retention of chirality. These phenylacetylenes would undergo Pd-catalyzed

(40), and isochromene (41) while maintaining the stereochemistry.
In 2018, the Liang group replaced epoxides with enantio-enriched aziridine 42a
as the alkylating reagent (Scheme 4.10a) [15a], thus realizing the synthesis of a
pair of indolines 43 and 44 with full chirality retention via palladium/norbornene
cooperative catalysis. Later on, the Zhou group explored this kind of reaction
using chiral aziridines as the alkylating reagent and alkenes or alkynes as the
terminal reagents (Scheme 4.10b) [15b]. The alkenylation products underwent
cyclization via the Michael addition, resulting in the formation of tetrahydroiso￾quinolines (THIQs). 5,6-Disubstituted imide-type NBE derivative (N3) was found
as the optimal cocatalyst. The regioselectivity of 1,3-cis-substituted (45) and
1,4-cis-substituted (46) tetrahydroisoquinolines was well controlled by applying
2-alkyl- or 2-aryl-substituted aziridines, respectively. Additionally, the alkynylation
product 47 could be advanced to tetrahydroisoquinoline 49 through a gold-catalyzed
cyclization and reduction with TFA/Et3SiH [16].

4.3 Catalytic Asymmetric Transformations Controlled
by Chiral Ligands
Although many important scaffolds have been constructed by the utilization of
chiral electrophiles, it is still essential to develop a catalytic asymmetric route by
employing chiral ligands or chiral NBEs in the Catellani reaction. The catalytic
asymmetric transformations concerned in this section are realized by chiral ligands,
which are classified into three categories. (i) Phosphine or phosphoramidite binding
to palladium center; (ii) amino acid binding to palladium center to assist the C–H
activation; (iii) chiral amino acid activating the carbonyl coupling partner. The use
of chiral ligands in realizing asymmetric catalysis has the following advantages: (i)
There is a vast array of chiral phosphine, phosphoramidite, or amino acid ligands,
either commercially available or readily synthesized; (ii) The stereochemistry of the
downstream reactions of M-3 can be reliably controlled by chiral ligands since no
norbornene is attached to M-3.
4.3.1 Catalytic Asymmetric Transformations Controlled by Chiral
Phosphine Ligands
During the synthesis of the rhazinilam-family natural products, for the first time,
the Gu Group reported a catalytic asymmetric Catellani reaction in 2016, in which
the chiral center was constructed by Pd/chiral phosphine-catalyzed intramolecular
Heck cyclization to deliver the desired product (52) with good yield and stereoselec￾tivity (Scheme 4.11) [17]. They have applied 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene asthe reacting
partner to combine with iodopyrrole to differentiate their reactivity, thus inhibit￾ing the generation of many byproducts. Under the optimized reaction condition, the
selected α-aryl tetrahydroquinoline derived phosphoramidite (L1) exhibited better
asymmetric induction than other chiral ligands such as (R)-BINAP and (R)-MOP.
The establishment of this asymmetric scaffold (52) is crucial in the total synthesis of
some biologically active natural productssuch as(+)-rhazinilam (53) and kopsiyun￾nanine C1-2 (54 and 55).
Scheme 4.11 Synthesis of enantio-enriched rhazinilam family natural products.4.3 Catalytic Asymmetric Transformations Controlled by Chiral Ligands 139
In 2018, Zhou and coworkers demonstrated a one-pot synthesis of tetrahydron￾aphthalenes (58) bearing a benzylic quaternary stereogenic center through the
asymmetric Catellani reaction (Scheme 4.12) [18]. The alkyl bromide was used
as a bifunctional reagent, which combined with iodonaphthalene to undergo
ortho C−H activation and an intramolecular redox-relay Heck cascade, yielding
the corresponding products (58, the absolute configuration was not given in the
article) with moderate yields and good enantiomeric excesses by applying Carreira’s
phosphoramidite ligand (L2) [19].
Scheme 4.12 Construction of tetrahydronaphthalenes with quaternary stereogenic center.
In 2018, the Gu group further applied the asymmetric Catellani reaction for the
synthesis of axially chiral biaryl compounds (Scheme 4.13) [20]. The optimized P,
C-type ligand (L3) possesses an axial chirality and a stereogenic chiral P center,
which was significant for constructing the desired product with good yields and
stereoselectivities. The reaction was compatible with various aryl boronic acids
(60) bearing different functional groups, such as fluoro, chloro, or trifluoromethyl
groups, substituted 1-iodonaphthalenes (59) bearing electron-rich or electron-poor
groups, and chloromethyl esters (61) with electron-withdrawing groups.
To explain the origin of the enantioselectivity for the above molecules, a mecha￾nism based on the previous studies was proposed [1, 2]. The oxidative addition of
the ANP complex with chloromethyl benzoate generates the Pd(IV) intermediate
(M-17), which then undergoes reductive elimination and β-carbon elimination
cascade to afford the Pd(II) intermediate (M-18). The product will be obtained
through the cross-coupling of intermediate (M-18) and aryl boronic acids, and the
stereochemistry is governed by the reductive elimination of the key diarylpalladium
species (M-19).
4.3.2 Catalytic Asymmetric Transformation Controlled by Chiral Amino
Acids
As one of the most available classes of organocatalysts, amino acids are valuable due
to their ease of access, high efficiency, and low toxicity, making them as an excellent
choice for promoting asymmetric transformations in the Catellani-type reactions.
The first chiral amino acid-catalyzed consecutive ortho C−H amination and
α-arylative desymmetrization process was developed by the Zhou group in
2019 (Scheme 4.14) [21], which yielded an important N-heterocyclic motif:
hexahydro-2,6-methano-1-benzazocine (64). S-Proline served as the chirality
source in this palladium/norbornene cocatalyzed reaction, although it exhibited140 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

low stereo-induction. (Note: the specific catalytic mode proposed by Gong and
coworkers would be discussed in the following.)
Scheme 4.14 Desymmetrization of N-containing ketones using chiral amino acids.
In 2021, Gong and coworkers made a significant improvement in the stereose￾lectivity by utilizing chiral indoline-2-carboxylic acid (L4) as the organocatalyst.4.3 Catalytic Asymmetric Transformations Controlled by Chiral Ligands 141
They illustrated a practical approach to access chiral all-carbon bridged ring
systems and benzo-fused nitrogen-containing bridged scaffolds (67) (Scheme 4.15)
[22]. In their study, a wide range of (hetero)aryl iodides, vinyl triflates, and
conjugated alkenyl iodides were able to react with O-benzoyl hydroxylamines or
4-(bromomethyl)-cyclohexanonece to undergo the ortho C–H amination or alky￾lation and intramolecular α-arylation cascade. Besides, many functional groups,
regardless of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing ones, were well-tolerated
under optimal conditions.
Scheme 4.15 Synthesis of chiral C- and N-containing bridged scaffolds.
In the catalytic cycle (Scheme 4.16), Gong and coworkers proposed a key
stereo-induction mode M-21, in which the amino acid acted as a bifunctional
catalyst: the amine reacted with the carbonyl group to form an enamine, enhancing
the nucleophilicity of the α-carbon of ketone, while the carboxylic acid bound to the
palladium center through an η3 mode to govern the stereochemistry. Instead of
the directed nucleophilic attack of enamine to the palladium center, they believed
that the enamine insertion into the aryl-palladium bond was preferable. Subse￾quently, reductive elimination of Pd(II) intermediate M-23 resulted in oxazaspiro
compounds, which delivered the final products upon hydrolysis.
In a recent joint study by Zhou and Yu groups, a new method for syn￾thesizing 1,3-disubstituted planar chiral molecules was developed using a
combination of Pd/amino acid catalyzed asymmetric C–H functionalization and
norbornene-mediated ortho functionalization (Scheme 4.17) [23]. The stereos￾elective step is the Pd/amino acid-catalyzed planar selective C–H activation by
forming intermediate M-24. The optimized procedure allowed for the use of a
range of aryl or heteroaryl iodides with varying degrees of electronic properties
as arylating reagents, which resulted in excellent stereoselectivity for the desired142 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

systems.
products. The bisarylation reaction using 4,4′
-diiodo-1,1′
-biphenyl as the coupling
partner afforded 69d in excellent enantioselectivity, featuring two instances of
planar chirality.
4.4 Catalytic Asymmetric Transformation Controlled
by Chiral Norbornenes
A new approach for controlling stereochemistry in the asymmetric Catellani-type
reactions has been developed using chiral NBEs, which was first developed by the
groups of Yu [24] and Dong [25] in 2018, independently. By applying chiral nor￾bornenes as a transient mediator, different strategies like desymmetrization, kinetic
resolution, and direct enantioselective transformation have been established. These
strategies hold greatsignificance, not only in synthetic organic methodology but also
in the total synthesis of natural products.
4.4.1 Desymmetrization
The catalytic enantioselective desymmetrization of readily available prochiral
molecules enables the production of enantiomerically pure compounds, which are
very important in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. Unlike a kinetic
resolution, which only converts half racemic substratesinto the desired enantiopure
products, desymmetrization transformations utilize all of the prochiral starting
materials.
2-Carbomethoxynorbornene was first time identified as a more effective tran￾sient mediator in Pd(II)-catalyzed Catellani-type meta-C(sp2)–H alkylation of
amides [26]. The introduction of a carbomethoxy group into the C=C bond ofScheme 4.17 Synthesis of 1,3-substituted planar chiral molecular.144 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
the norbornene skeleton breaks the symmetry of the molecule, allowing for the
development of chiral nonracemic NBEs (Scheme 4.18a). The addition of an ester
group further increases its reactivity, enabling a catalytic reaction with significantly
less than stoichiometric amounts of norbornene derivatives. Based on their previ￾ous findings that norbornene can intercept the ortho-palladation intermediate to
realize meta-C–H functionalization [27], in 2018, Yu and coworkers first applied
chiral norbornene to asymmetric Catellani-type reaction, achieving enantioselec￾tive meta-C–H functionalizations of benzylamines (72) or homobenzylamines.
Optically active norbornene N8 was prepared via desymmetrization reaction of
a ring-opening reaction of acid anhydride 70 [28]. Subsequently, hydrogenation
of 71, followed by decarboxylative bromination and elimination, gave N8. The
success of this transformation is based on a proper hypothesis that the directed
ortho-palladation step to form M-26 and M-27 is reversible (Scheme 4.18b). In
the subsequent alkene insertion step, enantio-enriched norbornene, i.e. N8, dif￾ferentiates the ortho-palladate intermediates M-26 and M-27; or the subsequent
alkene-insertion intermediates M-28 and M-29 showed significantly different
reactivity in the meta-C–H palladation step. Under the optimized condition, chiral
NBE (N8) was selected to act as a mediator in the ortho C–H activation to meta
C–H activation relay to afford corresponding amines with a chiral carbocenter
in good to high enantioselectivity. By employing (R)-BNDHP (L5) as an additive,
the desymmetrization transformation between benzylamines and aryl iodides
(Scheme 4.18c) provided the desired product (73) in satisfactory yield with good
functional group compatibility in slightly higher enantioselectivity. The arylation
and alkylation of homobenzylamines (74a) (Scheme 4.18d) could also be realized
in an asymmetric manner via palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis. Diverse
aryl iodides bearing electron-donating and withdrawing groups and even different
aliphatic coupling partners all worked smoothly with various substituted homoben￾zylamines in the reaction. Racemic secondary amines (Scheme 4.18e) could also
participate in the reaction to give both chiral amines and the arylated or alkylated
amines (75b) in high yields, and promising S factor. More importantly, this elegant
strategy opened the door of Pd(II)-initiated asymmetric Catellani-type reactions by
using a chiral norbornene mediator.
4.4.2 Kinetic Resolution
Kinetic resolution is an exceedingly effective strategy for achieving two different
chiral motifs in one step with one stereoisomer of racemic reactant participating in
the transformation, while retaining the other isomer. This method has proven to be
incredibly effective in the synthesis of many complex chiral organic scaffolds since
Sharpless’s groundbreaking work in 1981, wherein high levels of enantioselectivity
were obtained for allylic alcohols [29].
In 2018, Dong and coworkers concurrently developed chiral norbornene N9
and applied this tactic to the synthesis of chiral 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (DHBF,
78) (Scheme 4.19a) [25]. Enantiomerically enriched norbornene N9 was obtained
through diastereomer-separation using 2,10-camphorsultam as a chiral auxiliary.4.4 Catalytic Asymmetric Transformation Controlled by Chiral Norbornenes 145

The diastereomeric amide-derived NBEs (79a and 79b) were separated through
silica gel chromatography. Subsequent hydrolysis and esterification afforded the
desired N9 in 42% yield (98% ee). Racemic epoxides were used in the annulation
reaction with aryl iodides, employing isopropyl ester-substituted norbornene (N9)
as a cocatalyst. Racemic epoxides bearing diverse functional groups and substituted
aryl iodides underwentsmooth reactions, producing the corresponding DHBFs with
promising enantioselectivities and moderate to good yields. Control experiments
(Scheme 4.19b) carried out between 2-iodotoluene and (S)-epoxide 25 with either
(−)-N9 or (+)-N9 as the cocatalyst displayed that (−)-N9 matched better with
(S)-epoxide, affording the desired product 26 in a higher yield (88%) than the one
obtained using (+)-N9 (19% yield). Dong’s tactic of kinetic resolution marks the
beginning of Pd(0)-initiated asymmetric Catellani-type reactions.

In 2021, Zhou and coworkers demonstrated an asymmetric annulation between
aryl iodides and racemic tertiary benzyl alcohols, catalyzed by Pd/chiral NBE in
the process of kinetic resolution (Scheme 4.20) [30]. To distinguish the two enan￾tiomers of tertiary benzyl alcohols (81), chiral NBE with an ethyl ester substitution
(N10) was selected, which led to the production of chiral tertiary benzyl alcohols as
well as the corresponding benzo[c]chromenes (82) in good yields and high enan￾tioselectivity. The resolution demonstrated compatibility with aryl iodides bearing
electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.

4.4.3 Enantioselective Transformations
Transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric couplings are a widely used and straight￾forward strategy for constructing atropisomers, which are fundamental motifs in
pharmaceuticals, chiral ligands, and natural products. Among these reactions,
asymmetric Suzuki coupling has been powerful in atropisomer construction.
However, the challenge of requiring specific poly-substituted aryl halides at certain
positions is an obvious drawback of this strategy. Consequently, the Catellani-type
reaction, which enables the functionalization of both the ipso- and ortho-position
of aryl halides, provides an effective method for synthesizing chiral molecules,
particularly atropisomers.
In 2020, the Zhou group accomplished an elegant enantioselective synthesis of
biaryl atropisomers through a Catellani domino sequence (Scheme 4.21a) [31].
Chiral norbornene (N10) was applied in this processto overcome the steric hindrance148 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

of trisubstituted aryl bromides and afforded the desired axially chiral product (85)
with high efficiency. Aryl iodides (83) bearing electron-donating, -withdrawing, or
-neutral substituents were all well-tolerated. An electron-withdrawing group in aryl
bromides (84) was required, which can be distinguished by ANP intermediate to
avoid homocoupling. Moreover, the electron-withdrawing group in 84 such as an
ester group can chelate with the Pd(IV) intermediate and stabilize the transition
state and intermediate (M-30 compared with M-31) in the (S)-selectivity, which is
crucial for constructing (S)-axial chirality in the corresponding products. A wide
range of alkenes, regardless of the electronic nature of the substituents and sub￾stitution patterns, alkynes, boronic acids, cyanides, and so on were all competent
as terminating reagents. Furthermore, if only aryl iodides and α-carbonyl aryl
bromides (86) were used as the coupling partners, a fluorene product (87) bearing a
stereogenic carbocenter was obtained with a good yield and excellent enantiomeric
excess via intramolecular termination. It was hypothesized that the quaternary
stereogenic center originated from the axial-to-central chirality transfer step.
In 2021, Song and coworkers independently demonstrated a three-component
atroposelective Catellani-type reaction (Scheme 4.22) [32] for the synthesis of chiral
biaryl mono-phosphine oxides (89), which could be transformed into useful chiral
phosphine ligands. By utilizing n-propyl ester-derived norbornene (N11) as a chiral
mediator, they were able to seamlessly convert aryl iodides, aryl bromides with
ortho phosphine oxides substituent (88), as well as various termination reagents,
into optically active atropisomers in high yields. Moreover, various functional4.4 Catalytic Asymmetric Transformation Controlled by Chiral Norbornenes 149

groups were also successfully tolerated in this reaction and excellent enantiocontrol
has been achieved with diverse substrate combinations. Impressively, biaryl atropi￾somer 89d with two stereogenic axes was also accessible by applying this tactic,
albeit in a relatively lower yield.
The stereoinduction model proposed by Song and coworkers is illustrated in
Scheme 4.23. During the oxidative addition of aryl bromides with ANP M-32, a
chiral Pd(IV) complex M-33 was generated, which was bound intramolecularly
with the oxygen atom of the phosphine oxide and created a chiral environment. The
establishment of axial chirality is through reductive elimination of M-33 to give
M-34. The subsequent norbornene extrusion and termination cascade afforded the
desired product with good enantiocontrol and also regenerated the Pd(0) species.
Scheme 4.23 Mechanism for the construction of biaryls monophosphine oxides.
In 2021, Zhou and coworkers further developed a dual functionalization reaction
of 4-iodo-2-pyridone 90, which has rarely been reported in the Catellani-type reac￾tions (Scheme 4.24) [33]. With the chiral norbornene N10 as a transient mediator,150 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
Scheme 4.24 Synthesis of chiral pyridone derivatives.
pyridine 90 smoothly coupled with trisubstituted aryl bromide and styrene to deliver
pyridone derivatives (93) bearing axial chirality in good yields and excellent stereo￾control.
Later, a modular and convergent assembly of atropisomers with C–N axial
chirality was developed, which is typically more difficult to construct than the
classic C(aryl)–C(aryl) axial chirality due to the lowerrotation barriers around C—N
bonds (Scheme 4.25) [34]. This involved an ortho arylation and ipso intramolecular
amination cascade between readily available aryl iodides and 2,6-disubstituted aryl
bromides (94) containing an ortho amide group. The resulting phenanthridinone
product (95) was obtained in excellent enantioselectivity. A wide range of aryl
iodides bearing various electronic substituents were tolerated under the optimized
condition by using a catalytic amount of chiral NBE as a chiral mediator. Proper
steric hindrance in the aniline moieties was requested to ensure the stability of
the C–N axial chirality. Surprisingly, it was discovered that increasing the steric
hindrance of the aniline moiety (95c → 95d) resulted in a decreased rotation barrier
and subsequently led to the lower stability of C–N axial chirality. Atropisomers
with two stereogenic axes (97 and 99) could be constructed through the asymmetric
Catellani reaction of aryl diiodides or the following Suzuki coupling between chiral
phenanthridinone (95e) and arylboronic acids with satisfactory enantiocontrol
(Scheme 4.25b,c).
To explain the origin of stereoselectivity of the C–N axial chirality construction,
a process of axial-to-axial chirality transfer was proposed (Scheme 4.25a): A chiral
intermediate was generated in the usual manner, which then underwent intramolec￾ular amidation and subsequent chirality transfer from C–C axis to C–N axis, result￾ing in the corresponding products with excellent stereocontrol.
In 2022, the Zhou group disclosed an elegant synthesis of atropisomeric
o-terphenyls (101) bearing 1,2-diaxes in a single step with a chiral norbornene as
the single chiral source (Scheme 4.26a) [35]. It was reasoned that the construction
of the second axial chirality was through an axial-to-axial diastereo-induction. Aryl
iodides with various functional groups and 2,6-disubstituted aryl bromides with
an electron-withdrawing group worked well together to afford the corresponding
products in good yield with satisfactory diastereoselectivity and excellent enan￾tiopurity. Remarkably, the electronic nature of the substituent and substitution4.4 Catalytic Asymmetric Transformation Controlled by Chiral Norbornenes 151

pattern of potassium aryl trifluoroborates (100) did not affect the reaction. In
addition, atropisomer (104) bearing four chiral axes was smoothly synthesized
by replacing aryl iodide with 1,5-diiodonaphthalene 102 (Scheme 4.26b), with
excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity.
In 2022, the Liang Group further applied this strategy to the construction of axial
and planar chiralities(Scheme 4.27a) [36a]. Pd/chiral NBE cooperative catalysis first152 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

and excellent enantioselectivity. In 2023, the Zhou group reported a very similar
transformation to construct five- to seven-membered benzo-fused ferrocenes
(110) using enantiopure N10 (Scheme 4.27b) [36b]. However, the five-membered
products were found to be unstable and could be converted to the correspond￾ing ketones (111) through oxidation by O2 during the purification procedure.
1,1′
-Di(2-iodophenylethyl)ruthenocene also worked well to give the corresponding
benzo-fused ruthenocene (110c).
4.5 Summary and Outlook
In this chapter, we have summarized the history of developing the asymmetric
Catellani-type reactions in the construction of various optically active compounds,
which can be realized using chiral reagents, chiral P-centered ligands, amino
acids, or chiral norbornenes. Different electrophiles and termination reagents have
been utilized, enabling ortho- and ipso-functionalization of aryl iodides or triflates4.5 Summary and Outlook 153

with good enantioselectivity. As a result, a wide range of chiral scaffolds, such
as fused and bridged heterocycles, carbocycles, chiral secondary amines, axially
chiral biaryls, and atropisomeric o-terphenyls, have been efficiently constructed.
These scaffolds are vital moieties in bioactive natural products, chiral ligands, and
pharmaceuticals. Despite the rapid progress in this field, many challenges and
opportunities still exist. Firstly, while most of the efforts have been dedicated to
the development of stereogenic carbon centers and atropisomer synthesis via the
palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis, more attention is needed for the
construction of other types of chiral molecules. Secondly, there is a need to explore
a broader scope of electrophiles and termination reagents to achieve a more diverse
functionalization at ipso and ortho positions of aryl halides. Last but not least,
beyond the three chirality induction strategies described here, other innovative
enantioselective approaches, such as those involving supramolecular or cooperative
interactions, would benefit the advancement of this field.154 4 Asymmetric Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

5.1 Introduction
Palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis (Catellani-type reactions) represents
a direct and rapid approach for preparing densely substituted arenes. This trans￾formation operates through ortho C–H functionalization and subsequent ipso
termination of organopalladium(II) species to yield the decorated arene products.
Stimulated by the pioneering studies from the groups of Catellani [1] and Lautens
[2], this realm has evolved into a significant area of study within organic synthesis,
and it has evolved into a powerful and efficient approach for preparing highly sub￾stituted arenes otherwise challenging to prepare via conventional cross-coupling
methods [3].
Traditional palladium(0)/norbornene catalytic cycles commence with oxidation
of the aryl halide substrate (e.g. aryl iodide) to a Pd(0) to form the arylpalla￾dium(II) A. Intermediate A then undergoes the carbopalladation step with the
norbornene (NBE) to give insertion product B. With the Pd catalyst placed in
proximity to the ortho-C—H bond, the system then undergoes C–H activation
to form key arylnorbornylpalladacycle (ANP) C. Subsequent oxidative addition
of the electrophile 2 forms Pd(IV) D followed by reductive elimination to nor￾bornylpalladium(II) intermediate E. This species either can undergo a second C–H
activation/functionalization sequence, if a vacant ortho site is accessible, or under￾goes β-carbon elimination to expel the NBE (as typical β-hydrogen elimination
cannot occur) and generate arylpalladium(II) F. F then undergoes a conventional
cross-coupling progress with terminating reagent 3 (T–Y) to yield polysubstituted
product 4 and regenerate the Pd(0) catalyst [4] (Scheme 5.1).
Based on this mechanism, alternative methods for accessing organopalladium(II)
intermediate A beyond aryl halide oxidative addition could hypothetically expand
Catellani-type reactivity beyond electrophile substrates and enable powerful new158 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

mechanism.
applications. More specifically, the direct activation of azine N—H and arene C—H
bonds with Pd(II) catalysts to generate organopalladium(II) species represents
a potentially expedient entryway into a Catellani-type cycle. Theoretically, these
substrates do not require electrophile pre-installation, a significant advantage over
aryl halides and related systems. The concept of Pd(II)-initiated Catellani-type
catalysis has been realized in the elegant reports from Bach, Yu, Dong, Zhou,
and others in recent years. Realizing Pd(II)/NBE reactivity requires catalysts and
reaction conditions distinct from the optimal systems for traditional Pd(0)/NBE
catalysis. The emerging field of Pd(II)/NBE cocatalysis and its potential to unlock
synthetically valuable transformations has only further encouraged interest in5.2 Pd/NBE-catalyzed C–H Functionalization of NH-containing Heteroarenes 159
Catellani-type reactivity. In this chapter, we offer a comprehensive summary of
the recent advances and breakthroughs in this direction, aiming to inspire future
investigations and new progress in this field. This chapter is organized along the
types of substrates interacting with the Pd(II) catalyst, including NH-containing
heteroarenes, (hetero)arenes with or without a directing group, as well as aryl
boronic acids and their derivatives, with each substrate class discussed separately.
5.2 Pd/NBE-catalyzed C–H Functionalization
of NH-containing Heteroarenes
Through activation with Pd(II), the N—H bond of heterocycles offers a unique entry
point to the Pd/NBE cocatalytic cycle, which consequently permits the direct C–H
functionalization of these substrates. Pioneered by Bach, this class of Pd(II)/NBE
catalysis has been applied to the C2 C–H functionalization of NH-indoles and
NH-pyrroles, as well as related systems. Since indoles and pyrroles are common
heterocycle motifs of great interest to synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical
development, the regioselective C2 functionalization of these frameworks is a
highly desirable and significant objective. In this section, we discuss the C2
functionalization of NH-indoles and NH-pyrroles and the C1 alkylation of car￾bazoles using Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis, organized based on the employed
functionalization reagents.
5.2.1 C2 Alkylation of NH-Indoles and NH-Pyrroles
5.2.1.1 C2 Alkylation of NH-Indoles
The first pioneering studies were disclosed by the Bach group in 2011, which
first focused on the C–H alkylation of NH-indoles with primary alkyl halides
(bromides or iodides). These transformations, guided by the cooperative catal￾ysis of Pd(II)/NBE, led to the exclusive formation of C2 alkylated indoles
(Scheme 5.2) [5, 6]. A wide range of structurally varied 2-alkylindoles were
successfully synthesized in moderate to excellent yields.
Scheme 5.2 C2 Alkylation of NH-indoles.160 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
When C3-substituted NH-indoles were used as the substrates, an adjusted
approach was necessary. This adaptation entailed employing more reactive alkyl
iodide reagents, utilizing a more polar solvent, and maintaining an atmosphere of
air, as presented in Scheme 5.2. When dealing with electron-deficient NH-indoles,
the use of a weaker base, like KHCO3 or K2HPO4, was essential to inhibit
direct indole N-alkylation. Furthermore, the introduction of water was found to
significantly accelerate this procedure.
The suitability ofC3-substituted NH-indoles assubstrates and the complete lack of
reactivity of N-substituted indoles both indicate the crucial mechanistic role played
by the free NH moiety (Scheme 5.3a). In addition, by meticulously experimental
design, pivotal complex 12 and capture product 13, arising from the utilization of
β-iodostyrene asthe electrophile, were successfully isolated and characterized in two
key mechanistic experiment (Scheme 5.3b). These intermediates robustly support
the presence of an aminopalladation intermediate in the reaction mixture. Based on
these observations, a proposed reaction mechanism was elucidated and presented in
Scheme 5.3c. Activation of free N—H bond of indole 5 by Pd(II) wasfollowed by NBE
insertion to generate aminopalladation complex 15. C2 C–H activation of 15 leads
to the formation of the 5-membered palladacyclic complex 16. Subsequently, oxida￾tive addition between alkyl bromide and 16 affords the Pd(IV) complex 17, which
delivers norbornyl-palladium(II) intermediate 18 via reductive elimination. Finally,
the expulsion of NBE from 18 by β-carbon elimination followed protodemetallation
of the resulting intermediate 19 provides the ultimate product 2-alkylindole 7, and
simultaneously regenerates the Pd(II) catalyst [6].
The Bach group then reported the synthesis of a series of C2 alkylated tryptophans
21 using the same protocol using the N-Boc-protected ethyl ester of L-tryptophan
20a. Notably, thisreaction occurred without any erosion in enantiopurity of the start￾ing tryptophan substrate (Scheme 5.4) [7]. Importantly, this transformation neces￾sitates the presence of air during the process to prevent the reduction of Pd(II) to
Pd(0), much like the requirement for C3-substituted indole substrates.
In 2018, the Liu group [8] employed this approach to achieve the selective C2 tri￾fluoroethylation of indoles, utilizing commercially available trifluoroethyl iodide as
the alkylating reagent (Scheme 5.5a). This reaction demonstrates substantial toler￾ance toward various functional groups and can even be applied for the late-stage
trifluoroethylation of complex indole derivatives (Scheme 5.5b). Preliminary mech￾anistic studies indicate that the unique anionic ligand dibenzoylmethane (dbm) has
a pivotal function in improving the efficiency of this transformation by promoting
the oxidative addition of the relatively unreactive trifluoroethyl iodide with ANP
intermediate 16. Additionally, DFT calculations propose the involvement of N–H
activation of the indole substrate in the rate-determining step.
In 2020, Yang and coworkers reported a Pd(II)/NBE cocatalyzed C2 C–H alkyla￾tion of NH indoles with diethyl (iodomethyl)phosphonates electrophiles, leading
to the development of an efficient and concise route to 2-methylene phospho￾nate indoles, which are key building blocks for synthesizing indole alkaloids
(Scheme 5.6a) [9]. This protocol demonstrates improved efficiency and atom
economy compared with conventional synthetic approaches. Importantly, thisScheme 5.3 (a) Control experiments and (b) isolated intermediates; (c) proposed mechanism for the Pd(II)/NBE-mediated C2 alkylation of NH-indoles.162 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

reaction can be applied in the synthesis of promising DNA-binding quinolone 28
and nostodione 32 (Scheme 5.6b).
Recently, the Bach group [10], as well as Jiang, Qi and coworkers [11] reported
annulation reactions of indoles with 1,n-dibromoalkanes using PdCl2(MeCN)2 as
the catalyst and simple norbornene N1 as the mediator, respectively (Scheme 5.7).
When 1,3-bibromopropane as the di-electrophile, five-membered ring forma￾tion was observed at positions C2 and N (Scheme 5.7a). In contrast, the use
of 1,4-dibromobutane as the di-electrophile resulted in the formation of a
six-membered ring at positions C2 and C3 (Scheme 5.7b). The choice of base
was found to exert a significant influence on the reaction results. Bach’s reaction
conditions employed K2CO3 or K2HPO4 as the base, whereas Jiang and Qi’s
conditions used Cs2CO3 or K2CO3. Moreover, in Bach’s system, the annulation of
indoles with 1,3-dibromopropane required the addition of KBr and tetrabutylam￾monium bromide (TBAB) as additives, while in the annulation of indoles with
1,4-dibromobutane, additives were not beneficial.
In 2022, Mandal and coworkers have employed Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis
for the direct C2 C–H glycosylation of NH-indoles or tryptophan, enabling the
stereoselective construction of 2-glycosylindoles and tryptophan-C-glycosides
(Scheme 5.8) [12]. This method offers an efficient and step-economical route for
the synthesis of C-glycosides. Additionally, the practicality of this protocol has been
demonstrated by both a gram-scale reaction and a wide range of derivatizations.(a)

The synthetic utility of the C2 selective C–H alkylation of indoles via the
Pd(II)/NBE cocatalysis approach is illustrated by its successful applications
in the streamlined syntheses of several complex indole alkaloids, including
(±)-aspidospermidine (Scheme 5.9a) [6a], (±)-goniomitine (Scheme 5.9b) [6a],
(+)-kopsihainanine A (Scheme 5.9c) [13], (−)-aspidophylline A (Scheme 5.9d)
[14], (+)-strictamine (Scheme 5.9e) [15], (−)-deoxoapodine (Scheme 5.9f) [16], and
tryprostatin A (Scheme 5.9g) [17]. Also, see Chapter 8 for more details.
5.2.1.2 C2 Alkylation of NH-Pyrroles and C1 Alkylation of NH-Carbazoles
In addition to indole substrates, Bach and colleagues successfully extended the
application of Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis to the challenging selective C2
C–H alkylation of NH-pyrroles. The C2 alkylation of pyrroles encountered initial
difficulties with electron-rich and less acidic pyrroles such as 2-phenylpyrrole,
which gave unsatisfactory results, potentially due to the generally reduced N–H
acidity of pyrroles versus indoles. However, electron-deficient pyrroles proved to
be suitable substrates for this transformation, affording the corresponding C2 C–H5.2 Pd/NBE-catalyzed C–H Functionalization of NH-containing Heteroarenes 165

alkylated pyrroles 57 in moderate to high yields [18]. They then leveraged this
method as the key step in the concise synthesis of the lipophilic pyrrole natural
product mycalazal (Scheme 5.10).
In analogy to the indole annulations shown in Scheme 5.6, Jiang, Qi and cowork￾ers developed a Pd(II)/NBE cocatalyzed annulation reaction of electron-deficient
pyrrole 56a with 1,3-dibromopropane 33, forming 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-5-
carboxylate 58 in moderate yield (Scheme 5.11) [11].166 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

Scheme 5.12 C1 alkylation of NH-carbazoles.
Other NH-heterocycles are also compatible with the Pd(II)/NBE cocatalytic
C–H alkylation strategy. Ge, Maiti and coworkers recently introduced a direct
Pd(II)/NBE-catalyzed C1 C–H alkylation of NH-carbazoles (Scheme 5.12) [19]. This
transformation, which demonstrates divergent selectivity from electrophilic aro￾matic substitution methods, which prefer the C3 site, allows for expedient access to
C1-substituted carbazoles with exclusive selectivity. Notably, this reaction proceeds
via the formation of a six-membered palladacycle intermediate 60, representing
the first case of such an intermediate within the extensively investigated Pd/NBE
cooperative catalysis.
5.2.2 C2 Arylation of NH-Indoles
In their initial 2011 report of the C2 C–H alkylation of NH-indoles using Pd(II)/NBE
cooperative catalysis, Bach and coworkers showcased the potential to extend this
manifold to C2 C–H arylation with a single example of iodobenzene as the coupling
partner(Scheme 5.13a)[6a].In 2017,Jiang, Xue and coworkersreported more exten￾sive investigationsin the area of C2 arylation of NH-indoles, achieving the successful
synthesis of a range of C2-arylated NH-indoles with yields ranging from moderate5.3 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Functionalization of Arenes 167

to excellent (Scheme 5.13b) [20]. Asis often the case in Catellani-type reactions with
aryl iodide coupling partners, they observed that employing electron-rich indoles in
combination with electron-poor aryl iodidestypically resulted in higher yields, likely
due to the favorable electronic impact on the ortho C–H activation and oxidative
addition steps.
5.3 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H
Functionalization of Arenes
The selective functionalization of carbon-hydrogen (C—H) bonds via transition￾metal catalyzed C–H activation has had profound impacts on the field of synthetic
chemistry [21]. Although significant strides have been made in selectively func￾tionalizing ortho-C—H bonds of arenes, accessing the C–H functionalization of
more remote sites (meta) to a directing functional group has remained a formidable
challenge. Recently, several strategies have emerged to tackle this challenge [22].
For instance, there have been Ir-catalyzed remote C–H borylations directed by
noncovalent interactions [23], Ru-catalyzed meta-C–H functionalizations [24], and
design and development of U-shaped directing templates for remote Pd-catalyzed
C–H activations [25]. Complementing these strategies, remote C–H activation
via Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis has been achieved by the groups of Yu,
Dong, Zhao, Shi, Ferreira, and others [26–43]. As presented in Scheme 5.14, this
approach capitalizes on directed ortho-C–H palladation and subsequent Catellani’s
NBE insertion/deinsertion to facilitate meta-C–H functionalization of the arene
substrates [44]. Subsequent studies have demonstrated this strategy’s compatibility
with phenylacetic acid, β-arylethylamine, benzyl amine, aniline, and phenol
substrates.
In this section, we have provided an overview of meta-C–H functionalization of
arenes with a directing group using Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis, as organized
based on the nature of the functionalization reagent, encompassing alkylation, ary￾lation, chlorination, amination, and alkynylation. Moreover, a distal-selective C–H
functionalization of Z-alkenes with a directing group is also discussed.168 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

functionalization.
5.3.1 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Alkylation of Arenes
Motivated by the distinctive Pd(0)-initiated Catellani-type reactions involving aryl
iodides and in alignment with their ongoing interest in directed C–H function￾alization, Yu and colleagues reported a sophisticated method for the meta-C–H
alkylation of phenylacetic amides through Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis in
2015 (Scheme 5.15a) [26]. This breakthrough marked the demonstration that meta￾C–H alkylation could be accomplished by orchestrating directed ortho-C–H acti￾vation and a transient mediator-NBE. The employment of a newly developed
pyridine-based ligand 73 was found to be essential for relaying the Pd catalyst to
the meta position through NBE after the initial ortho-C–H activation. However, this
procedure had a limited substrate scope due to the restriction that the alkylating
reagents must lack β-hydrogen, such as benzyl halides, iodomethane, and ethyl
iodoacetate.
To address the previously mentioned constraint, Yu and coworkers used a
more reactive mediator 2-carbomethoxynorbornene N2, in conjunction with the5.3 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Functionalization of Arenes 169
Scheme 5.15 Meta-selective C−H alkylations of arenes with a directing group.
quinoline-type ligand 75. This innovative combination allowed them to establish a
more versatile and efficient meta-C–H alkylation process with a broader range of
the alkylating reagents, including 13 examples (Scheme 5.15b) [27].
Subsequently, the same group achieved meta-C–H alkylation of benzylsul￾fonamide (sulfonamide as an ortho-directing group) by using N2 and a simple
isoquinoline as the ligand, leading to the formation of the desired meta-alkylated
products 77 in moderate yields (Scheme 5.15c) [28].
In 2018, Ding and coworkers documented the direct meta-alkylation of
nosyl−protected methyl ester of phenylalanine derivatives in 24–92% yields
(Scheme 5.15d) [29]. In this approach, they introduced another NBE derivative
diisopropyl bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylate (N3), along with simple
pyridine, which proved to be the optimal combination of mediator and ligand.
Remarkably, no racemization occurred during this transformation.170 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
It is worth emphasizing that in the above-described meta-selective C–H alkylation
protocols, hindered secondary alkyl iodides and bromides have been shown to be
inappropriate alkylating reagents.
5.3.2 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Arylation of Arenes
Biaryl motifs are commonly found in bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceu￾ticals [30]. Therefore, substantial efforts have been dedicated to developing efficient
approaches for rapidly constructing biaryls. Building on the success of meta-C–H
alkylation reactions of arenes with a directing group via Pd(II)/NBE cooperative
catalysis, in 2015, the Yu group and the Dong group independently showcased that
this strategy can be applied to meta-C–H arylation, offering a unique route to diver￾sified biaryls. To present these accomplishments in a clear and organized manner,
the content will be discussed separately based on the type of ortho-directing group
employed, which including amide, tertiary amine,sulfonamide, pyridine, quinoline,
and free carboxylic acid groups.
5.3.2.1 Amide as Directing Group
After the successful introduction of meta-C–H alkylation of phenylacetic amides
employing Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis in 2015, the Yu group unveiled the
corresponding selective meta-C–H arylation for the first time (Scheme 5.16a)
[26]. By slightly modifying the reaction conditions from Scheme 5.15a, a range
of aryl iodides with ortho-coordinating groups as well as the highly reactive
3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-iodobenzene were demonstrated to be suitable coupling
partners, affording the corresponding biaryls 81 in yields ranging from moderate
to high.
Scheme 5.16 Meta-selective C−H arylations of phenylacetic amides.
Despite these advancements, it is important to note that the arylation
reagents utilized in the aforementioned reaction predominantly consisted of
aryl iodides possessing electron-withdrawing ortho-coordinating groups or mul￾tiple electron-withdrawing substituents. Consequently, there has been a growing5.3 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Functionalization of Arenes 171
demand for the development of a more versatile meta-arylation procedure that
is compatible with common aryl iodides. In pursuit of this objective, Yu and
coworkers established an efficient meta-C–H arylation process with a broader scope
of aryl iodides, facilitated by the use of quinoline ligand 75 and modified NBE N2
(Scheme 5.16b) [27].
In 2016, the Zhao group reported a bidentate directing group, i.e. oxalyl amide,
which can assist selective meta-arylation of β-arylethylamine derivatives 82 using
simple NBE (N1) as the mediator (Scheme 5.17) [31a]. They observed that a wide
range of aryl iodides bearing ortho-, meta- and para-substituents proceeded well to
yield the desired biarylsin moderate to high yields. Itshould be noted that the result￾ing products were subjected to further transformations via sequential ortho-C–H
functionalizations, ultimately affording the polysubstituted arylethylamine deriva￾tive 84 in a moderate yield (Scheme 5.17b) [31b].
Scheme 5.17 (a) Meta-selective C−H arylations of β-arylethylamine derivatives;
(b) synthetic application.
Subsequently, Shi and colleaguesintroduced a new directing group forthe interan￾nular meta-C–H arylation of biaryl-2-trifluoroacetamides(Scheme 5.18) [32]. In this
transformation, the trifluoroacetyl protecting group played a pivotal role in achiev￾ing interannular selectivity, possibly owing to its electronic properties and binding
ability. It is worth noting that the reaction proceeded smoothly when using aryl
iodides bearing an ortho electron-withdrawing group as substrates. Conversely, aryl
iodides with meta- or para-substituents yielded the corresponding products in low
Scheme 5.18 Meta-selective C−H arylations of biaryl-2-trifluoroacetamides.172 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
yields. In such instances, switching from simple norbornene N1 to 2-ester substi￾tuted NBE N2 enhanced the reaction yields. Notably, the Shi group isolated and
characterized the dimeric palladacycle 87, comprising two cyclopalladated trifluo￾roacetamino biaryl units linked through the trifluoroacetamide moiety, as the key
intermediate in this transformation.
5.3.2.2 Tertiary Amine as Directing Group
Nearly concurrently with Yu’s seminal work [26], in 2015 Dong and coworkers
disclosed a unique meta-arylation approach of arenes using Pd(II)/NBE catalysis,
employing tertiary amine as the directing group (Scheme 5.19) [33]. It was worth
highlighting that, while most Pd/NBE-catalyzed meta C–H functionalizations are
initiated from a six-membered or larger palladacycle to avoid catalyst inhibition,
this work represents a rare case that the Catellani process can be initiated after a
five-membered C–H palladation process. Notably, AsPh3 served as the ligand and
an intriguing “acetate cocktail” comprising LiOAc⋅2H2O, CsOAc, Cu(OAc)2⋅H2O,
and acetic acid was utilized to promote the reaction. The reaction conditions
exhibited excellent tolerance toward a wide variety of functional groups, including
some heteroarenes. Nonetheless, an aryl iodide with an ortho electron-withdrawing
substituent was necessary to make it a compatible coupling partner. Furthermore,
the amine-directing group could be readily converted into various other common
functional groups, such as benzyl chloride and aldehyde.
Scheme 5.19 Meta-selective C−H arylations of benzyl amines.
5.3.2.3 Sulfonamide as Directing Group
In 2017, the Yu group presented a meta-selective C–H arylation of nosyl-protected
arylethylamines and phenylglycine esters 92, utilizing Pd(II)/NBE cooperative
catalysis with sulfonamide as the directing group (Scheme 5.20a) [34]. When
nosyl-protected 2-aryl anilines 94 were subjected to this protocol, meta-C–H
arylation occurred at the remote aryl ring (Scheme 5.20b). The incorporation of
4-Ac-pyridine as a ligand played a pivotal role in this process, and the palladium
catalyst loading could be decreased to 2.5 mol%. This catalytic system demon￾strated compatibility with a series of aryl iodides and aryl bromides containing
ortho-coordinating groups, providing the corresponding biaryls in moderate to
high yields. Notably, in the case of nosyl-protected arylethylamines 92, a catalytic5.3 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Functionalization of Arenes 173
Scheme 5.20 Meta-selective C−H arylations of nosyl-protected aryl ethylamines,
phenylglycines, and 2-aryl anilines.
amount of N1 (10–20 mol%) proved sufficient to effectively facilitate this meta-C−H
arylation reaction, which represented a significant advance in the Pd(II)-initiated
Pd/NBE catalysis (Scheme 5.20a).
The Yu group recently reported the utilization of a sulfonamide as the directing
group in the meta-selective C–H arylation of benzylsulfonamide derivatives 76 via
Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis (Scheme 5.21) [28]. The reaction employed iso￾quinoline as the ligand and N2 as the mediator, allowing the straightforward assem￾bly of meta-arylated benzylsulfonamide derivatives 96. Significantly, these resultant
products can be readily converted into sodium sulfonates, sulfonate esters, sulfon￾amides, and styrenes by Julia-type olefination.
Scheme 5.21 Meta-selective C−H arylations of benylsulfonamides.
5.3.2.4 Pyridine Derivative as Directing Group
In 2016, Yu and coworkers achieved the meta-C–H arylation of anilines, heteroaro￾matic amines, phenols and 2-benzyl pyridine derivatives 97 (Scheme 5.22a) [35].
By employing the versatile 3-acetylamino-2-hydroxypyridine 98a or its trifluo￾romethylated derivative 98b as the ligand and N1 as the mediator, a wide array of
meta-arylated products 99 were obtained in good to excellent yields. This protocol
also displayed good compatibility with both heteroarene substrates and coupling
partners involving heteroaryl halides. The practicality of this approach in drug174 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

discovery was illustrated by the successful late-stage meta-C−H arylation of a
lenalidomide derivative 100 in good yield (Scheme 5.22b).
Subsequently, the same group introduced an elegant approach for meta-C–H
arylation of benzylamines utilizing a pyridine-type N-substituted directing group.
The reaction was facilitated by N2 and pyridone-type ligand 103, leading to the for￾mation of meta-arylated benzylamine derivatives 104 in moderate to excellent yields
(Scheme 5.23) [36]. Pleasantly, heterocycle-containing substrates and arylating
reagents(aryl iodides) were both tolerated in this process. Remarkable, the directing
group could be easily removed through a two-step process to provide the N-Boc
benzylamine derivatives 105, which could be converted into a range of biologically
relevant compounds, such as the RPR 128515 analogs 106 (Scheme 5.23b).
(a)
(b)
Scheme 5.23 (a) Meta-C−H arylation of benzylamine derivatives; (b) synthetic application.
In 2018, the Yu group accomplished the meta-C–H arylation of masked aro￾matic aldehydes 107, utilizing modified NBE mediator N2 in combination with
pyridone-type ligand 103b (Scheme 5.24) [37]. The method relied on a pyridine-type
directing group, which also functioned as a masking group for aryl aldehydes and
could be easily installed and removed. Control experiments revealed that a correct5.3 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Functionalization of Arenes 175
Scheme 5.24 Meta-C−H arylation of masked aromatic aldehyde derivatives.
length of this directing group was essential for enabling the critical migratory
insertion step efficiently. A broad spectrum of masked aryl aldehyde substrates and
aryl iodide coupling partners proved to be compatible with this reaction, resulting
in the generation of the corresponding masked biaryl aldehydes 108 in satisfactory
yields. Subsequently, treatment of compounds 108 in heated TBAF solution afforded
unmarked biaryl aldehydes 109.
5.3.2.5 Acetal-based Quinoline as Directing Group
In 2017, the Ferreira group developed the meta-C–H arylation of acetal sub￾strates 110 derived from benzyl alcohols (Scheme 5.25a) [38]. The success of this
transformation hinged on the utilization of a unique acetal-based quinoline-type
directing group (QuA), a distinct amino acid-derived ligand N-trifluoroacetylglycine
(TFA-Gly-OH) and NBE mediator N2. This methodology displayed remarkable
compatibility with various functional groups, affording the corresponding biaryl
compounds in moderate to high yields. Moreover, the meta-arylation could be
combined with ortho-arylation or olefinations, enabling the generation of polysub￾stituted arenes and offering a versatile platform for diversifying aromatic systems.
Furthermore, the QuA directing group could be effortlessly removed and recovered
under very mild reaction conditions (Scheme 5.25b).

5.3.2.6 Free Carboxylic Acid as Directing Group
In 2017, the Yu group realized the more challenging free carboxylic acid-directed
meta-C–H arylation of arylacetic acids 113 (Scheme 5.26) [39]. The efficiency of
this process was notably influenced by the choice of an appropriate mono-protected
3-amino-2-hydroxypyridine-type ligand 114 and the use of N2. It should be noted
that an extensive array of aryl iodides, encompassing those with noncoordinating176 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

substituents (20 examples), showcased robust reactivity to afford the corresponding
products 115 in moderate to high yields.
5.3.3 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Chlorination of Arenes
Aryl chlorides hold significant importance as fundamental chemicals, primarily
owing to their broad applicability in transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling
reactions. Among the various methods available for preparing aryl chlorides, the
direct C–H chlorination of arenes is particularly attractive in terms of both atom
economy and step economy. In 2016, Yu and coworkers reported a Pd(II)/NBE
N2 cocatalyzed meta-C−H chlorination of phenol and aniline derivatives bearing
a pyridine-type directing group (Scheme 5.27a) [40]. They employed aryl chloro￾sulfate 116 as the chlorination reagent, and a distinctive pyridine derivative 117a
served asthe preferred ligand. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a wide variety
of substrates containing diverse functional groups exhibited compatibility, forming
the corresponding meta-chlorinated products 118 in good to excellent yields. It is
worth noting that this approach also extended its applicability to pharmaceutically
significant heterocycles, like indole, thiophene, and indazole derivatives. Further￾more, the resulting chlorinated products could be transformed into a large number
of valuable synthons that are nontrivial to access via direct meta-C–H functional￾ization, for instance, borylation and alkoxylation. Following a similar strategy, the
same group achieved the meta-C–H chlorination of benzylamine derivative 102
with an N-substituted pyridine-type directing group in 2017 (Scheme 5.27b) [36].
5.3.4 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Amination of Arenes
Aromatic amines represent significant structural scaffolds prevalent in bioac￾tive natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials [41]. The
transition-metal catalyzed C–H amination of aromatic compounds has emerged as
an efficient and powerful approach to preparing aromatic amines. In 2016, Yu and
coworkers developed the Pd(II)/NBE cooperatively catalyzed meta-C–H amination
of phenol and aniline derivatives bearing a specially designed pyridine-type direct￾ing group (Scheme 5.28a) [42]. The combination of 3-amino-2-hydroxypyridine-type
ligand 114 and modified NBE N2 were found to be essential for this reaction, and
substantial meta-aminated products (46 examples) were synthesized in moderate
to good yields. Using a similar strategy, the meta-C–H amination of benzylamine
derivative 102 and masked aryl aldehyde 107 both featuring a pyridine-type
directing group was also unveiled by the same group (Scheme 5.28b-c) [36, 37].Scheme 5.27 Meta-C−H chlorination of (a) aniline, phenol, and (b) benzylamine derivatives.178 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

5.3.5 Directing Group-Enabled meta-C–H Alkynylation of Arenes
In 2016, the Yu group reported the sole example of a meta-C–H alkynylation of
anilines bearing a pyridine-derived directing group, enabled by a Pd(II)/NBE cocat￾alytic system (Scheme 5.29) [42]. Enhanced reactivity and selectivity (meta- versus
ortho-alkynylation) were achieved by employing pyridine-based ligand 125 along
with LiF as an additive. A series of aniline substrates with various functional groups
were tolerated, affording the corresponding meta-C–H alkynylated productsin mod￾erate to good yields. Note that, except for the bulky silyl-protected alkynyl bromides,
the use of simple alkyl and aryl alkynyl bromides as alkynylating reagents resulted
in only trace amounts of the desired products.
Scheme 5.29 Meta-C−H alkynylation of aniline derivatives.
5.3.6 Directing Group-Enabled Distal C–H Functionalization
of Z-Alkenes
In 2020, the Dong group presented a Pd(II)/NBE cocatalyzed distal C–H arylation
and alkylation of both acyclic and cyclic Z-alkenes featuring an oxime ether-derived5.4 Directing Group-Free Mono- and Difunctionalization of (Hetero)Arenes 179

directing group (Scheme 5.30a) [43]. This reaction was achieved through the use
of 3-CF3-2-pyridone ligand 103a in conjunction with an amide-modified NBE N4.
Under the optimized reaction conditions, a wide range of primary and secondary
alcohol-derived Z-alkenes with diverse functional groups were tolerated, providing
the desired distal C–H arylated or alkylated products in moderate to good yields
with excellent site-selectivity. Additionally, apart from the primary and secondary
alcohol derivatives, allylic and homoallylic protected amine substrates with a
pyridine-derived directing group also demonstrated good reactivity under slightly
modified reaction conditions (Scheme 5.30b).
5.4 Directing Group-Free Mono- and Difunctionalization
of (Hetero)Arenes
As described above, the meta C–H functionalization of arenes with a directing
group has achieved significant advancements owing to the proximity-induced
enhanced reactivity and selectivity that is enabled by coordinating functional
groups. On contrary, site-selective C–H functionalization of (hetero)arenes without
a directing group remains a formidable challenge. It is only until recently that
remarkable breakthroughs have been achieved by the groups of Yu, Dong, and
Fernández-Ibáñez. In this section, we summarize the directing group-free mono￾and difunctionalization of (hetero)arenes.
5.4.1 Directing Group-Free meta-C–H Arylation of (Hetero)Arenes
In 2019, Yu and coworkers reported a regioselective meta C–H arylation of a
plethora of electron-rich alkoxyarenes, including 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran and chro￾mane (Scheme 5.31a) [45]. The alkoxy aromatics lacking a directing group could be
“relayed” after palladation at the ortho/para-position using a modified norbornene
N2, which effectively translocated the palladium to the meta-position to accomplish
meta-C–H arylation, thus reversing the conventional site selectivity controlled by
electronic effects. It should be noted that both the use of a modified NBE N2 and180 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

the combination of two different ligands are critical to achieving a high yield of
the desired products. The DFT calculation suggested that the ligand promoted
initial C–H palladation, which was the rate-determining step [46]. Later, the same
group developed the meta-arylation of fluoroarenes and benzene (Scheme 5.31b)
[47] as well as electron-deficient five-membered heteroarenes, such as thiophenes,
pyrroles, and furans (Scheme 5.31c) [48] using a similar strategy.
In 2022, the Fernández-Ibáñez group developed a new catalytic system based on
the Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis and an S,O-ligand 148 for the meta-C–H aryla￾tion of anisole derivatives(Scheme 5.32a) [49]. Notably, alkoxyarene substrates bear￾ing electron-donating and withdrawing substituents as well as ortho-substituted aryl
ethers were all tolerated in the presence of catalytic amounts of the modified NBE
(N7–N10), affording the corresponding products 136 in good yields. Remarkably, the
challenging unsymmetrical diarylation of anisole was also realized in a sequential
fashion, and a series of desired unsymmetric meta-arylated products 149 that are
nontrivial to access were efficiently synthesized in moderate yields (Scheme 5.32b).5.4 Directing Group-Free Mono- and Difunctionalization of (Hetero)Arenes 181

5.4.2 Directing Group-Free Difunctionalization of Heterarenes
While significant progress has been made in meta C−H mono-functionalization
through the Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis, the corresponding vicinal difunc￾tionalization via sequential double C−H activation remained unreported until
2019, when Dong and coworkers achieved a direct vicinal difunctionalization of
thiophenes and furans without the assistance of directing groups. In the presence of
an arsine ligand and a C2 methyl amide-modified NBE N11, a broad array of mono￾and disubstituted thiophenes and furans were difunctionalized site-selectively
and regioselectively at the C4 and C5 positions (Scheme 5.33a) [50]. In addition,
this strategy can be applied to the late-stage vicinal difunctionalization of complex
bioactive compounds. Besides, a practical gram-scale preparation was demonstrated
under open flask conditions, utilizing readily available commercial ethyl acetate
without the need for further purification. Following a similar strategy, recently, the
same group successfully achieved the direct vicinal di-carbo-functionalization of
indoles in the presence of a C1-substituted NBE (N12), which effectively facilitated
the turnover-limiting oxidative addition step (Scheme 5.33b) [51].
In 2021, the Dong group developed a new reaction mode of PdII/NBE cooper￾atively catalyzed difunctionalization of five-membered heteroarenes using two
distinct electrophilic reagents (Scheme 5.34a) [52]. In contrast to the previous
system, which used both nucleophilic and electrophilic coupling partners, this
approach exclusively harnessed electrophiles. To ensure the efficient progression of182 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

the reaction, the electrophiles employed must have distinct reactivities, allowing for
sequential and predictable coupling events. The key to this process is to use a π-type
electrophile (alkynyl bromides) as the second electrophile. This process proceeded
optimally when using a trifluoromethylated amide-modified NBE (N13) and AsPh3
as the ligand. Pyrroles, furans, and thiophenes are all amenable to this reaction.5.5 Template-Enabled Remote C–H Functionalization 183
Importantly, this method can be applied in the concise preparation of P38a MAPK
inhibitor analog 159 (Scheme 5.34b). Furthermore, when using a trifluoromethyl
acyl-substituted aryl iodide 160 as a bifunctional electrophile, an intramolecular
termination was observed, leading to the formation of cyclization products in good
yields without the need for reductants (Scheme 5.34c).
5.5 Template-Enabled Remote C–H Functionalization
In 2020, Yu, Houk and coworkers disclosed an elegant approach using Pd(II)/NBE
cocatalysis to relay the selectivity of remote directing templates to C(sp2)—H bonds
that are located further away, thus expanding the range of remote C—H bonds
accessible for functionalization. They demonstrated this strategy on quinolines and
other heterocycles using the remote directing templates (T1–T3) in conjunction
with 2-ester substituted NBE N2, with reactivity enabled by an MPAA ligand
(Ac-Gly-OH). A broad spectrum of pharmaceutically important heterocycles,

arylation of tetrahydroisoquinolines; (c) para-C–H arylation of phenylpropanoic acid
derivatives.184 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
including quinolines, benzoxazoles, and benzothiazoles are tolerated under the
established optimal reaction conditions, giving the desired C6–H arylated products
in satisfactory yields (Scheme 5.35a) [53]. Notably, a late-stage modification of an
antileukemic and antitumor alkaloid, camptothecin was also achieved. Addition￾ally, they observed that tetrahydroisoquinoline substrates could be arylated at the
C7 position (Scheme 5.35b), which is one bond further away from the “typical” C8
selectivity conferred solely by the U-shape template. Likewise, phenylpropanoic
acid derivatives bearing conventionally meta-selective U-shaped directing tem￾plates could be effectively arylated at the para-position using a similar approach
(Scheme 5.35c).
Later on, using the strategy reported by Yu, Maiti and coworkers accomplished
the para-selective C–H arylation of sulfonates, phosphonates, and phenols bear￾ing 2,6-disubstitution patterns through the use of a simple cyanophenol-based
meta-directing group (Scheme 5.36a) [54]. Importantly, this protocol enables
the synthesis of hexa-substituted benzene by sequential selective distal C–H
functionalization, which is otherwise nontrivial to access (Scheme 5.36b).

5.6 Enantioselective Remote C–H Functionalization
Enantioselective remote C–H functionalization represents one of the most chal￾lenging yet appealing directions in the realm of organic synthesis. In this regard,
three achievements were recently reported by the groups of Yu and Zhou. The
first example involves the enantioselective meta-C–H arylation and alkylation of
diarylmethylamines and homobenzylamines, orchestrated through the synergistic
catalysis of a Pd(II) catalyst and the chiral NBE N2* (Scheme 5.37) [55]. According
to mechanistic studies, a rapid, reversible, racemic ortho C–H activation first5.6 Enantioselective Remote C–H Functionalization 185
Scheme 5.37 Enantioselective meta-C−H arylation and alkylation.
occurs followed by enantioselective NBE insertion and meta-C–H activation; the
asymmetric differentiation is achieved in these protocols. Remarkably, N2* assumes
the dualroles of a transient mediator and an efficient chiralsource, which engenders
stereomeric differentiation within the racemic ortho-C–H palladation intermedi￾ates, thereby controlling the enantioselectivity (Scheme 5.37a). This asymmetric
meta-C–H arylation reaction showcased a broad substrate scope and exhibited high
enantioselectivities. It accommodates a diverse range of prochiral benzylamines
171 bearing a pyridine-type N-substitution as the directing group, prochiral N-nosyl
homobenzylamines 173, and racemic N-nosyl homobenzylamines 175 substrates,
and various aryl iodide coupling reagents. Additionally, aside from aryl iodides,
a single aryl bromide, methyl 2-bromobenzoate, has been identified as a suitable
arylation reagent, affording the desired product in moderate yield and excellent
enantioselectivity. Regarding the asymmetric meta-C–H arylation of 171 via desym￾metrization, it has been observed that the enantioselectivity can be significantly
improved through the addition of (R)-BNDHP (1,1′
-binaphthyl-2,2′
-diyl hydrogen
phosphate) (Scheme 5.37b). Moreover, enantioselective meta-C–H alkylation
has also been accomplished for substrates 173 (via desymmetrization) and 176
(via kinetic resolution) using ethyl iodoacetate or iodomethane as the reagents
(Scheme 5.37c–d). Undoubtedly, these remarkable achievements, facilitated by the186 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
cooperative catalysis of Pd(II) and the chiral mediator N2* will pave a new pathway
for enantioselective remote C–H functionalization–one of the most formidable
challenges in asymmetric catalysis.
Another elegant example is regarding the construction of axial chirality through
atroposelective remote meta-C–H arylation/alkenylation of 2-arylanilines 178 by
Yu, Wang and coworkers (Scheme 5.38a) [56]. After a thorough examination of
various chiral NBEs, it was determined that the chiral NBE* (N2*) emerged as the
most effective mediator. This method exhibited excellent tolerance to a series of
biaryl-2-amines bearing diverse substituents, generating meta-arylated axially chiral
products 179 in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor
up to 167). Significantly, the utilization of the free aniline group as a directing group
endows this approach with significant practical advantages for synthetic applica￾tions. Furthermore, this protocol for C–H functionalization that occurs remotely
from the axial axis creates a novel class of axially chiral molecules, thereby present￾ing fresh prospects in the realm of asymmetric catalysis. For instance, the chiral

phosphine ligand 182 derived from the meta-arylated product displays enhanced
stereoinduction in asymmetric allylic alkylation reaction when compared to its
unsubstituted precursor scaffold 183 (Scheme 5.38b). A proposed mechanism is
presented in Scheme 5.38c. Initially, ortho-C–H activation of rac-178 with Pd(OAc)2
generates palladacycle 188, which subsequently undergoes migratory insertion
with N2* to afford intermediate 189. The insertion of N2* is the enantiodetermining

step, leading to the kinetic resolution of rac-178. Then, meta-C–H activation occurs,
resulting in the formation of chiral aryl-NBE* palladacycle (ANP*) species 190. This
ANP* species undergoes oxidative addition with the organohalide electrophiles,
followed by reductive elimination to deliver PdII intermediate 191. Then β-carbon
elimination and protodepalladation of Intermediate 191 take place, providing the
product (S)-179 while concurrently regenerating the PdII catalyst.
Planar chiral ferrocenes (PCFs) are extensively explored structures in asymmetric
catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science [57]. While the current
synthetic methods have predominantly focused on 1,2-disubstituted PCFs, the
direct synthesis of 1,3-disubstituted PCFs has remained a challenging issue.
Recently, Zhou, Cheng, Yu and coworkers developed an enantioselective remote
C–H arylation for the construction of 1,3-disubstituted ferrocenes/ruthenocenes
with excellent enantioselectivities (Scheme 5.39a) [58]. This method introduces an
innovative mechanism for remote enantiocontrol. Initially, the enantiodetermining
step involves the C–H activation at the C2 position of ferrocenes, facilitated by
a chiral mono-N-protected amino acid (MPAA) ligand. Subsequently, this acti￾vation is relayed to the remote C3 position through a C1-substituted mediator
N15 (Scheme 5.39b). Notably, the reaction tolerates various functional groups,
offers a streamlined synthetic pathway, and is compatible with widely accessible
aryl iodides/bromides as coupling partners. The resulting products can be read￾ily tailored to give novel planar chiral ligands and catalysts. Among these, the
1,2,4-trisubsituted PCF 200 serves as an excellent chiral ligand for the asymmetric
nucleophilic addition of diethylzinc to benzaldehyde, affording the corresponding
alcohol 202 in 96% yield with 92% ee (Scheme 5.39c). The planar chirality space
uncovered by this approach will open up new avenues in the fields of asymmetric
catalysis, materials science, and pharmaceutical chemistry.
5.7 Borono-Catellani Reactions
Aryl boronic acids and their derivatives are readily accessible and highly valuable
organic reagents. In traditional Catellani-type processes, these compounds pri￾marily serve as terminating reagents [3]. Drawing inspiration from the previously
reported Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis chemistry, it was surmised that the
initial aryl-Pd(II) species could also be generated through the transmetalation of
arylboronic acids or their derivatives to Pd(II), as shown in Scheme 5.40. Following
the Catellani process, the Pd(II) catalyst can be regenerated via oxidation of the
Pd(0) after the ipso termination.
Indeed, in 2018, the groups of Zhang [59] and Zhou [60] independently developed
a novel Pd(II)-initiated Catellani-type reaction that employed these readily available
aryl boronic acids or boronates assubstrates,replacing the conventional aryl halides,
to react with alkyl halides (primarily bromides and iodides) and alkenes, which
was named as the “borono-Catellani reaction” (Scheme 5.41). In Zhang’s work, the
reaction was conducted under an N2 atmosphere at 80 ∘C, using Cu(OAc)2 as the
oxidizing agent to regenerate the Pd(II) catalyst. Interestingly, it is observed that the5.7 Borono-Catellani Reactions 189

addition of two equivalents of water and 25 mol% of benzoquinone (BQ) as additives
substantially enhanced the reaction efficiency (Scheme 5.41a). Conversely, the Zhou
group disclosed more practical reaction conditions: the reaction was carried out at
room temperature (30 ∘C) in an open flask with no requirement for phosphine lig￾ands or additional additives (Scheme 5.41b). Besides ortho alkylation, an ortho-C–H
arylation of readily accessible arylboronic acid pinacol esters was also realized by
the Zhou group in 2019 using aryl bromides as the electrophiles, in which a C5,C6
diester-substituted NBE (N16) proved to be optimal (Scheme 5.41c) [61].
In 2019, the Dong group unveiled a redox-neutral Pd(II)/NBE-catalyzed pro￾cess for the ortho acylation and amination of aryl boroxines, wherein the Pd(II)
regeneration was realized through a protonation process (Scheme 5.42a,b) [62].
In contrast to the traditional Catellani reaction, this method did not require the
addition of stoichiometric bases and reductants. The key innovation lies in utilizing
protons as the second electrophile introduced at the ipso position. For the ortho
acylation reaction, AsPh3 proved to be the most effective ligand, likely through
promoting both the transmetalation and protodepalladation steps (Scheme 5.42a).
In the case of ortho amination with aryl boroxines, phosphite-type ligands, such190 5 Pd(II)-Initiated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

as P(OPh)3, demonstrated the highest efficiency (Scheme 5.42b). Soon after, Zhou
and coworkers realized a similar Pd(II)/NBE cocatalyzed redox-neutral ortho C–H
amination of pinacol aryl- or heteroarylborates without the addition of phosphine
ligands (Scheme 5.42c) [63].
A significant advantage of the borono-Catellani reaction lies in its ability to
tolerate aryl iodide groups, which are typically highly reactive under the standard
Pd(0)-initiated Catellani-type reaction conditions. This unique chemoselectivity
within the borono-Catellani reaction has facilitated the orthogonal reactiv￾ity between aryl iodides and aryl boron species, which has been successfully
demonstrated in Zhou [60, 63] and Dong’s works [62], respectively (Scheme 5.43).
5.8 Conclusion and Outlook
In this chapter, we have provided an overview of the emerging area of Pd(II)/NBE
cooperative catalysis and its applications in organic synthesis. As our discussion
illustrates, this intriguing domain has seen significant research in recent years,
leading to remarkable advancements. Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis has proven
to be a powerful complement to classical Catellani-type reactions. This strategy5.8 Conclusion and Outlook 191

Scheme 5.42 Redox-neutral ortho acylation and amination of aryl boronic acid derivatives.
has enabled a diverse range of substrates, including NH indoles, pyrroles, and
carbazoles, (hetero)arenes, as well as aryl boronic acids and derivatives to undergo
highly selective functionalizations, leading to valuable polysubstituted aromatics in
a direct and rapid manner, significantly expanding the established paradigm of this
field.
However, despite these notable advancements, the Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catal￾ysis is still in its early stage and several challenges remain. Firstly, the scope of func￾tionalization reagentsisrelatively limited, with the majority of examplesfocusing on
C–H alkylation and arylation processes. Thus, there is a clear need for the develop￾ment of more efficient and diverse types of electrophilic reagentsto provide a broader
range of products. Secondly, these reactions often require stoichiometric quantities
of mediators for optimal efficiency. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop more
powerful catalytic mediators that facilitate the Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis to
take place in a more efficient manner. Thirdly, although the pioneering efforts in
the area of enantioselective Pd(II)/NBE cooperative catalysis have demonstrated the
remarkable capability of chiral mediators for distal stereocontrol, there have been
few (only three) examplesreported to date, and viable chiral NBEs are limited to scaf￾folds bearing C2-ester substitution. Thus, the exploration and development of chiral
NBEs with substitutions at other positions or entirely new classes of chiral olefins
beyond NBEs could enable the discovery of valuable new enantioselective trans￾formations. Finally, beyond the substrates that have been explored, there is much
potential to broaden the practicality and utility of Pd(II)/NBE cocatalysis through
further efforts to diversify the substrate scope.(a)

6.1 Introduction
Heteroarenes serve as essential structural cores in the development of new func￾tional materials and drug candidates, rendering their diversification an important
objective in organic syntheses [1]. Traditionally, the regioselective functionaliza￾tion of heteroarenes has relied on the use of heteroaryl halides in Pd-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions (Figure 6.1a) [2]. In recent years, an alternative strategy
has gained prominence, namely, Pd-catalyzed C–H functionalization, allowing for
regiodivergent transformations of parent heteroarenes (Figure 6.1b) [3]. However,
both of these approaches have a limitation – they enable mono-functionalization
at each step, necessitating sequential multistep processes for di- and trifunction￾alization. Furthermore, this sequential approach often encounters challenges in
achieving regioselectivity among multiple C–halogen bonds or multiple C—H
bonds in substituted heteroarenes. In contrast, the application of Pd/norbornene
(NBE) cooperative catalysis, involving the formation of heteroaryl norbornyl
palladacycles, presents a versatile alternative [4, 5]. This method allows for multi￾functionalization, utilizing not only heteroaryl halides but also parent heteroarenes,
which substantially broadens the scope of substituted heteroarenes accessible
through Pd catalysis (Figure 6.1c).
This chapter describes Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis applied to haloheteroarenes
and parent heteroarenes. NBE mediators have proven instrumental in achieving
di- and trifunctionalization of various five- and six-membered heteroarenes [6]. In
addition, NBE derivatives have been integrated as building blocks, affording nonpla￾nar heteroaromatic compounds and π-extended systems. These examples illustrate
the reactivity patterns of heteroarenes in the presence of Pd catalysts and NBE,
furtherfacilitating the development of Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis. This chapteris
structured based on the ring size of the heteroarenes. Bi- and tricyclic heteroarenes
have been classified as five- or six-membered heteroarenes based on the size of the
ring where the reaction occurs. It begins with a discussion of reactions involving200 6 Functionalization of Heteroarenes by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

reactions but offers guidance on where to find further details.
6.2 Pd/NBE Reactions of Five-Membered
Haloheteroarenes
6.2.1 Reactions of Haloheteroarenes without Incorporation of NBE
The Lautens group has demonstrated that the utility of the Catellani reaction is not
limited to aromatic compounds by synthesizing polysubstituted (benzo)thiophenes
(Scheme 6.1) [7]. Their investigation revealed the critical effect of halide positioning
in determining the efficiency of the reaction. When utilizing 3-iodothiophene,
the anticipated Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis resulted in 91% yield of the trifunc￾tionalized product as a result of C—H activation at both the C2 and C4 positions
(Scheme 6.1a). However, the reaction with 3-iodobenzothiophene was less efficient
than its monocyclic counterpart, affording the difunctionalized product in 56%
yield (Scheme 6.1b). More notably, the 2-iodo positional isomer was inactive
(Scheme 6.1c).
The proposed mechanisms for the Catellani reactions of iodothiophenes illustrate
the impact of halide positioning (Scheme 6.2). Following the conventional Pd/NBE
catalysis pathway, the process commences with oxidative addition (2-I), followed by
insertion into NBE to generate the Pd adduct 2-II (Scheme 6.2a). Subsequently, the
five-membered palladacycle 2-III is formed, followed by its reaction with iodobu￾tane. The halide position can affect all these steps: the initial oxidative addition
by Pd(0) species occurs more readily with 2-iodothiophene than with the 3-iodo
variant [2]. However, the C—H bond at the C2 position of 3-iodothiophene is
more readily cleaved than the one at the C3 position of the 2-iodo counterpart
(Scheme 6.2b) [8]. In addition, the palladacyclesformed from these isomeric iodoth￾iophenes are likely to react differently with iodobutane to afford an intermediate6.2 Pd/NBE Reactions of Five-Membered Haloheteroarenes 201

like 2-IV. However, the C4 position of 3-iodothiophene, positioned similarly to the
previously unreactive C3 position of 2-iodothiophene, readily undergoes alkylation
(Scheme 6.1a). This result suggests that sulfur coordination, as proposed by Dong
and coworkers [9], likely plays a more significant role than electronic effects,
thus suppressing the reaction of 2-iodothiophene (Scheme 6.2c). In this context,
the Dong group’s development of a bridgehead-substituted NBE resulted in a
promising outcome for the difunctionalization of 2-iodothiophene, indicating the
potential to control sulfur coordination through the steric effects of NBE mediators
(Scheme 6.2d) [10].
Similar to the reactions of iodothiophenes, the position of a halide was important
in Catellani reactions of iodopyrazoles (Scheme 6.3) [11]. Although both the C4
and C5 positions of pyrazoles are amenable to Pd-catalyzed C–H functionalization
reactions [12], only 5-iodo-1-methylpyrazole afforded the corresponding Catellani
product in moderate yield following the Lautens protocol. In contrast, the 4-iodo
counterpart proved ineffective due to the difficulty of forming a palladacycle
through the C5 position and subsequent oxidative addition, attributed to the
steric effect of the pyrazole N-substituent. The reactivity difference of these
haloheteroarenes prompted the development of annulation reactions with NBE
derivatives (see Section 6.2.2).
Although examples remain limited, prefunctionalized indoles have been used
in Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis, with the choice of the nitrogen-protecting group
playing a critical role. For example, the Lautens group achieved difunctionalization
of 3-iodo-1-tosyl-indole, where they found that an N-tosyl group was crucial, as
the N-methyl counterpart generated only the corresponding direct Heck prod￾uct (Scheme 6.4a) [7]. In contrast, the Dai group demonstrated the amenability
of aryl thioesters for decarbonylative difunctionalization, with an N-phenyl
indole outperforming its N-methyl analog in ortho-alkylation/ipso-Heck reactions
(Scheme 6.4b) [13].202 6 Functionalization of Heteroarenes by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

These examples utilizing prefunctionalized five-membered heteroarenes are
mostly limited to ortho-alkylation/ipso-Heck reactions. Given the significant
advancements in the types of electrophile and nucleophile partners in Pd/NBE
cooperative catalysis, more efforts should be directed toward applying these reac￾tions to the synthesis of diverse heteroarenes. In this context, the Lautens group
has extensively studied intramolecular reactions of Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis,
which can be found in Chapter 1.1.

for exploiting heteroaryl norbornyl adducts, such as 5-I, for transforma￾tions beyond Catellani-type reactions (Scheme 6.5) [11]. It was found that
4-iodo-1-methylpyrazole, which did not undergo Catellani reactions, was
well-suited for a 1:2 annulation process with norbornadiene (NBD) via com￾plex 5-II, resulting in the formation of a rigid nonplanar polycyclic heteroaromatic
compound. The 1:2 annulation exhibited high exo- and trans-selectivity. In
addition, the remaining alkene moiety in the resulting annulation products
underwent additional transformations, including retro-Diels–Alder, addition, and
polymerization reactions. The annulation with NBE was also facile, giving 94%
yield (not shown). As expected, the 5-iodo counterpart, which readily underwent204 6 Functionalization of Heteroarenes by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
Catellani reactions through the formation of palladacycle 5-III, produced the annu￾lation product in low yield. When such palladacycles are formed, their insertion
into additional NBD is prohibited, rather than favoring oxidative addition to give
other NBE-incorporated products (see Scheme 6.7b).

Similar to the pyrazole examples, (benzo)thiophenes exhibited the same reaction
pattern for the Catellani versus 1:2 annulation reactions (Scheme 6.6) [11]. For
example, both 2-bromothiophene and its benzofused one were readily converted to
the corresponding 1:2 annulation products. However, 3-bromo counterparts that
easily formed palladacycles were inefficient for the annulation reactions.

In addition to 1:2 annulation, the heteroaryl NBE adduct underwent a three￾component coupling with 1,3-azoles, such as (benz)oxazoles and (benzo)thiazoles
(Scheme 6.7). For example, the pyrazole NBE adduct 7-I, derived from a
4-halopyrazole and NBE, underwent a C–H activation with benzoxazole via 7-II6.2 Pd/NBE Reactions of Five-Membered Haloheteroarenes 205
to give the corresponding three-component coupling product 7-III (Scheme 6.7a).
In contrast, 5-iodo-1-methylpyrazole favored the generation of palladacycle
7-V, which subsequently underwent oxidative addition with the iodopyrazole
(Scheme 6.7b). The selective reductive elimination of the C(sp2)—C(sp2) bond of
7-VI afforded the pyrazole/NBE 2:1 annulation product 7-VII with high selectivity
[14, 15]. Similar to Catellani and heteroarene/NBE 1:2 annulation reactions, the
position of halides was important. The 5-iodopyrazole did not participate in the
three-component coupling reaction (7-VIII), whereas the 4-bromo variant did not
undergo heteroarene/NBE 2:1 annulation (7-VII, 0%). In addition to pyrazole,
these transformations were achieved with thiophene and indole derivatives.
Furthermore, the utility of the heteroaryl NBE adduct was demonstrated in the
three-component coupling reactions with terminal alkynes followed by Pd- and
Au-catalyzed cyclization reactions in the synthesis of benzo-fused heteroarenes
[16, 17].

The incorporation of NBE derivatives via the heteroaryl norbornyl Pd adducts has
successfully generated nonplanar polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds. However,
these reactions are sensitive to the halide position, necessitating the preparation of
specific haloheteroaryl regioisomer precursors. In cases where asymmetrical prod￾ucts are needed, such as in three-component coupling reactions, new strategies are
needed to address the inherent reactivity challenges posed by haloheteroarenes.206 6 Functionalization of Heteroarenes by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

Haloheteroarenes
6.3.1 Reactions of Six-Membered Haloheteroarenes without
Incorporation of NBE
The Pd(OAc)2/P(2-furyl)3 catalytic system used for the Catellani reaction of
(benzo)thiophenes (see Scheme 6.1) was extended to include pyridine derivatives
(Scheme 6.8) [18]. The addition of an excess of NBE proved to be essential to pre￾vent direct Heck reactions with alkenes. Similar to the mechanism described
in Scheme 6.2a, the reaction led to dialkylation at the ortho-position and
ipso-alkenylation of 3-iodopyridine (Scheme 6.8a). However, 2- and 4-iodopyridines
failed to provide the desired products, indicating the importance of halide positions.
Additionally, iodoquinolines, as well as iodoisoquinolines, were amenable to
Catellani reactions with slight modifications to reaction conditions, employing
PPh3 and CsOAc as the ligand and base, respectively (Scheme 6.8b).

In a similar manner, multisubstituted carbazoles were prepared by Pd/NBE
cooperative catalysis. The iodide at the C3 position, which can be easily prepared
by electrophilic iodination of carbazoles, enabled ortho- and ipso-functionalization
to afford 2,3,4-trisubstituted carbazoles (Scheme 6.9) [19]. The C1 position of
carbazole can also be functionalized by Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis by forming
a palladacycle through the carbazole (NH) group and C1 position [20], which is
described in Scheme 6.26.

Based on the Catellani reactions involving aryl iodides and N-alkyl benzamides
[21], Cushman and coworkers developed a method tailored for the reaction of
analogous compounds: 4-bromoquinoline and o-bromobenzamides with bulky
N-substituents (Scheme 6.10a) [22]. With a specific focus on developing a method
that can tolerate bulky N-substituents, optimization studies were performed
to find a catalytic system derived from Pd(TFA)2 and the XPhos ligand. The
annulation was achieved by the formation of a palladacycle with NBE (10-I),
oxidative addition of a benzamide followed by reductive elimination (10-II),
β–C elimination of NBE (10-III), and ring closure. Although only one example
using 4-bromo-3-methylpyridine was included, it suggests the possibility of using
4-halopyridines for this transformation (Scheme 6.10b).

The importance of heteroarenes underscores the need for the examination
of heteroarenes when new methods based on Pd/NBE cooperative cataly￾sis are developed. In a recent development by the Dong group, a novel class
of N,N-bissulfonylmethoxyamines has been introduced to facilitate ortho￾methoxylation reactions (Scheme 6.11) [23]. When coupled with Heck reac￾tions, a diverse range of aryl iodides undergo transformation into the corresponding
difunctionalized products. This methodology exhibits a high degree of gener￾ality, making it directly applicable to a wide range of heteroarenes, including
2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, dibenzofuran, carbazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, and
pyridine derivatives. These examples clearly demonstrate the compatibility of
benzo-fused azine substrates with this protocol.It is worth noting, however, thatsuc￾cessful examples of pyridines were limited to those containing a 2-methoxy group.
As with the previous example, the range of monocyclic six-membered halohete￾rocycles suitable for Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis is quite limited. The majority of208 6 Functionalization of Heteroarenes by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

research in this field has primarily focused on aromatic compounds, with only a
few selected heterocycles examined for their generality. Among these, one of the
most frequently investigated substrates is 3-halo-2-methoxypyridine. This choice is
likely attributed to the fact that the presence of the 2-methoxy group reduces the
influence of the Lewis basic nitrogen, thus minimizing interference with the desired
catalytic transformations. Examples include (i) ortho-acylation/ipso-cyanation [24],
(ii) ortho-amination/ipso-methylation [25], (iii) ortho-methylation/ipso-Heck
[26], (iv) ortho-carbamoylation/ipso-Heck [27], (v) ortho-glycosylation/ipso-Heck

(xi) ortho-amination/ipso-Heck cyclization [34] (Scheme 6.12). Therefore, a sys￾tematic evaluation of various six-membered heterocycles is highly desirable to map
out the compatibility of different types and positions of substituents with Pd/NBE
cooperative catalysis.

C–H functionalization, has also been developed. Yamamoto et al. found that
4-iodo-2-quinolones were suitable for Catellani reactions with o-bromobenzyl
alcohols (Scheme 6.13) [35]. The annulation provided a variety of pyranoquinoline
alkaloid derivatives. The proposed mechanism is similar to other Catellani
reactions, involving the formation of palladacycle 13-I, oxidative addition
followed by reductive elimination to give 13-II, NBE elimination, and ring
closure of 13-III. Computational studies were performed to support concerted
metalation-deprotonation for the formation of palladacycle 13-I rather than elec￾trophilic palladation. The DFT calculations also supported the result that reactions
of tertiary alcohols gave higher yields than those with primary and secondary6.3 Pd/NBE Reactions of Six-Membered Haloheteroarenes 209

The scope of partially aromatic six-membered heterocycles expands significantly
with the successful functionalization of 2-pyridone and uracil derivatives through210 6 Functionalization of Heteroarenes by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis(Scheme 6.14) [36]. Although there was a potential for
cyclopropanation involving carbometallation into the 2-pyridone unit, as observed
in reactions with alkenyl halides [37, 38], the use of structurally modified NBE
derivatives, such as NBE-CONHMe and NBE-CO2Et, enabled the difunctionaliza￾tion of 2-pyridone compounds (Scheme 6.14a). Along with the use of a different
NBE mediator, a switch in solvent from 1,4-dioxane to DME was necessary when
employing aryl bromides in place of alkyl bromides. Furthermore, this method
facilitated the difunctionalization of uracil derivatives, albeit with a slightly reduced
yield (Scheme 6.14b).

Similarly, 3-iodochromone, a member of partially aromatic heterocycles, found its
application in Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis (Scheme 6.15a) [39]. It was critical to
use a modified NBE mediator with an ester group at the bridgehead position, which
presumably facilitates β–C elimination of the NBE mediator. During the initial
optimization experiments employing the tri(2-furyl)phosphine ligand, the NBE
mediator with the ester group exhibited a marked advantage over the parent NBE
(67% versus 10%). Further optimization of stoichiometry and reaction temperature
led to the identification of the optimal conditions for the synthesis of (iso)flavone
derivatives. However, in the annulation with trifluoroacetimidoyl chlorides, simple
NBE proved sufficient, enabling access trifluoromethyl-substituted tetracyclic ring
systems (Scheme 6.15b) [40].6.3 Pd/NBE Reactions of Six-Membered Haloheteroarenes 211

6.3.2 Reactions of Six-Membered Haloheteroarenes
with Incorporation of NBE
As 3-iodochromone can undergo difunctionalization by NBE mediators (see
Scheme 6.15), it also offers potential for NBE incorporation. For example, in
the reaction of 3-iodochromone, NBE, and α-bromoacetophenone, palladacy￾cle 16-I undergoes oxidative addition and reductive elimination to afford 16-II
(Scheme 6.16) [41]. With the assistance of the carbonyl group, trans β–H elimination
occurs, leading to the incorporation of a norbornene ring in 16-III. Subsequent ring
closure of the corresponding enol provides the three-component coupling product.

addition to NBE with α-bromoacetophenone, benzyl bromides [42] and dimethyl
squarate [43] facilitated vicinal addition to NBE (Scheme 6.17). In the reaction of
benzyl bromide, a switch of NBE to NBD resulted in a reduced yield (41%, 84:16
dr, not shown), while the norbornene ring remained without a retro-Diels–Alder
reaction. Notably, dimethylsquarate served as aC1 source, providing a methyl group,
in contrast to its conventional use as a C4 source. The proposed mechanism involves
an intramolecular cyclization, which includes the cleavage of activated sp3 C—H
bonds of the benzyl and methyl groups, respectively.

The reactivity of 3-iodochromone was further explored in the three-component
reactions with NBE and strained ring systems. Specifically, cyclopropenone and
N-tosyl aziridine functioned as sources of carbon monoxide and vinylidene,
respectively (Scheme 6.18) [44, 45]. Both methods were employed to incorporate
NBD, offering many opportunities for subsequent modifications of the norbornene
ring in the resulting products. However, the reactions with NBD exhibited lower
yields than those with NBE. In the case of cyclopropenone, it was proposed that
carbon monoxide might be directly generated from the substrate, or alternatively,
the palladacycle could undergo oxidative addition with cyclopropenone, followed
by the removal of diphenylacetylene. When N-tosyl aziridine was utilized, the
elimination of TsNH2 occurred upon the completion of cycloaddition. However, the
precise mechanistic details of this process warrant further investigation.
The electronic character of 3-iodochromone allows for selective C(sp2)—C(sp3)
coupling in contrast to the conventionally preferred C(sp2)—C(sp2) coupling in the
reactions with NBD and aryl iodides [14]. When 3-iodochromone reacted with NBD
and 4-iodotoluene, it gave the corresponding three-component coupling product
via palladacycle 19-I (Scheme 6.19) [46]. The position of the methyl group in the
resulting product indicates that the formation of the C(sp3)—C(sp2) bond prefer￾entially occurs to afford 19-II. This is ascribed to the stabilization of intermediate6.3 Pd/NBE Reactions of Six-Membered Haloheteroarenes 213

19-III by the electron-donating effect of the oxovinyl ring. Subsequent C(sp2)–H
cleavage followed by reductive elimination gives rise to 19-V, which undergoes a
retro-Diels–Alder (rDA) reaction to form the xanthone derivative.
In addition, using 8-bromo-1-naphthoic acid and NBE derivatives enabled the
annulation of 3-iodochromone (Scheme 6.20a) [47]. Both NBE and NBD were
readily incorporated to enable [3+2+2] annulation. The symmetric nature
of the resulting naphthalene moiety upon decarboxylation mitigated concerns
about selectivity for C(sp2)—C(sp2) versus C(sp3)—C(sp2) bond formation.
Similarly, 4-iodoisoquinolin-1(2H)-ones underwent annulation with NBE and
8-bromo-1-naphthoic acid (Scheme 6.20b) [48]. In place of 8-bromo-1-naphthoic
acid, o-bromobenzoic acid could be used for [2+2+2] annulation, providing
divergent reactions of 4-iodoisoquinolin-1(2H)-ones.

6.4 Pd/NBE Reactions of Parent Heteroarenes
The Dong group demonstrated the direct use of parent heteroarenes for vicinal
difunctionalization without the need for prefunctionalization. They first achieved
the difunctionalization of thiophenes by merging direct C–H activation of parent
thiophenes and Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis (Scheme 6.21) [9]. The initial steps
involve C–H cleavage of thiophene to form 21-I, followed by subsequent addition
to NBE to form 21-II. However, the coordination of the sulfur atom could prevent
further reactions, favoring 21-III over 21-II. To overcome this problem, a weak6.4 Pd/NBE Reactions of Parent Heteroarenes 215

and π-acidic ligand, namely AsPh3, was employed, which facilitated dechelation
to afford palladacycle 21-IV. Furthermore, to address the absence of an ortho sub￾stituent in five-membered heterocycles, which usually promotes β–C elimination
through steric effects, a bulkier NBE was adopted, allowing for the transformation
of 21-V to 21-VI. The method tolerates a variety of functional groups, enabling the
synthesis of tri- and tetra-substituted thiophenes.
Complementary to conventional C–H arylation without Pd/NBE cooperative
catalysis, which favors the α-position of thiophenes, pyrroles, and furans [8], the
Yu group demonstrated selective β-arylation using a structurally modified NBE
and two types of nitrogen ligands, L1 and L2 (Scheme 6.22) [49]. Although its
scope is limited to the monofunctionalization of five-membered heteroarenes
containing carbonyl groups, this β-selective method is generally applicable to all
three five-membered heteroarenes with one heteroatom.
The Dong group further expanded the scope of functional groups that can
be installed at parent five-membered heteroarenes by utilizing two distinct
electrophiles (Scheme 6.23) [50]. To achieve selectivity with these two electrophiles,216 6 Functionalization of Heteroarenes by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

they employed aryl iodides and alkynyl bromides as the first and second elec￾trophiles, enabling difunctionalization of pyrroles. Alkynyl bromides exhibited
lower reactivity than NBE for migratory insertion (23-I → 23-II) and are also less
reactive than aryl iodides for the oxidative addition of heteroaryl norbornyl pallada￾cycles (23-III → 23-IV). Importantly, as NBE insertion is a reversible process, the
heteroaryl Pd(II) intermediate 23-V, once formed, eventually undergoes migratory
insertion into alkynyl bromides followed by trans-β-bromide elimination.
This strategy was also extended to the difunctionalization of thiophenes and
furans (Scheme 6.24) [50]. Both electron-rich and electron-deficient thiophenes,
as well as aryl- and alkyl-substituted furans, were tolerated to give tri- and
tetra-substituted heteroarenes. For optimal results, a different NBE mediator was
required for each heterocycle family, illustrating its significant role in controlling
Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis.

The importance of an NBE mediator has been further demonstrated in the
difunctionalization of indoles (Scheme 6.25) [51]. The electronic and steric prop￾erties of indoles differ from those of thiophenes (see Scheme 6.21), requiring the
development of new strategies. Key differences include that initial palladation
preferentially occurs at the C3 position of indoles, making the nitrogen substituent
affect the stability of the resulting palladacycle 25-II formed through C–H cleavage
at the C2 position of 25-I. NBE mediators featuring substituents at the bridgehead
position were found to be consistently effective, with the cyclohexyl derivative
affording optimal results. DFT calculations support that the cyclohexyl group
destabilizes the indolyl norbornyl adduct 25-I and the resulting palladacycle 25-II,
thereby reducing the activation barrier of the subsequent turn-over limiting step,
oxidative addition of methyl 2-iodobenzoate to give 25-III. Although a broad range
of indole substituents and alkenes was compatible, the presence of an ortho ester or
amide group in aryl iodides was found to be essential to facilitate oxidative addition
through a chelation effect.218 6 Functionalization of Heteroarenes by the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

The (NH) group in nitrogen-containing heterocycles offers opportunities for the
formation of palladacycles through the activation of the (NH) group and adjacent
sp2 C—H bonds. This enables Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis of parent indoles
[52–54], pyrroles [55], and carbazoles (for indoles and pyrroles, see Chapter 5.2).
While most methods rely on the formation of five-membered palladacycles, the
formation of six-membered variants was explored for the C1-functionalization of
carbazoles (Scheme 6.26) [20]. A weak base was used to avoid direct N-alkylation
of (NH)-carbazoles, and the formation of palladacycles through the nitrogen atom
and C1 position allowed for C1-alkylation and acylation using alkyl bromides and
aromatic anhydrides, respectively.

In addition to five-membered heteroarenes, six-membered heteroarenes, such as
(iso)quinolines, have been diversified by template-assisted remote C–H functional￾ization, which is described in Chapter 5.4.
6.5 Conclusion
Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis emerges as a robust method for functionalizing het￾eroarenes with unconventional substitution patterns that are typically beyond the
reach of traditional cross-coupling and C–H activation reactions. While adapting
established protocols for aromatic compounds can sometimes yield similar transfor￾mations with heteroarenes, the distinct electronic and steric properties of the latter
pose many challenges. In response, novel strategies involving new ligands and NBE
mediators, carefully tailored to modulate key heteroaryl norbornyl palladacycles,
have been developed to overcome these issues. Nevertheless, it is essential to
recognize that the scope of heteroarenes and the diversity of installable substituents
still fallshort compared to aromatic compounds. This underscoresthe ongoing need
for systematic evaluation of heteroarenes and their coupling partners to expand the
chemical space of heteroarenes. Specifically, the pursuit of direct heteroarene func￾tionalization, without the need for prefunctionalization, remains highly desirable.
Moreover, Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis offers opportunities to functionalizing
remote or previously unreactive C—H bonds, which would otherwise remain inert
in the presence of Pd catalysts alone. This emphasizes the significance of Pd/NBE

7.1 Introduction
Polysubstituted arenes are ubiquitously found in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
and functional materials [1]. In particular, about 87% of small-molecule drugs
contain at least one aromatic ring [2]. Thus, significant efforts have been made
to develop efficient and selective methods to introduce functional groups (FGs)
onto aromatic rings, including electrophilic aromatic substitution, nucleophilic
aromatic substitution (SNAr), and cross-coupling reactions. However, it remains
rare to install two different FGs simultaneously in a single reaction step from
monofunctionalized aromatic substrates.
In 1997, Catellani et al. reported the first palladium/norbornene (NBE)-catalyzed
difunctionalization of aryl iodides to assemble symmetrical 2,6-dialkylated viny￾larenes in a regioselective manner [3]. A more synthetically useful protocol was
later disclosed by the same group to prepare unsymmetrical polyfunctionalized
arenes by using ortho-substituted aryl iodides as substrates (Scheme 7.1) [4].
The mechanism of this transformation is depicted in Scheme 7.2: the oxidative
addition of the Pd(0) complex with the aryl iodide formsthe intermediate 7-1, which
undergoes migratory insertion with the NBE cocatalyst to generate 7-2. The subse￾quent C—H palladation leads to the formation of the aryl-norbornyl palladacycle
(ANP) intermediate 7-3, which further reacts with the electrophile to introduce
the functionality at the ortho position upon reductive elimination. The following
β-carbon elimination of 7-5 would extrude the NBE and form the aryl-Pd(II)X com￾plex (7-6). Finally, a typical cross-coupling termination at the ipso position would
produce the difunctionalized product and regenerate the active Pd(0) catalyst. The
success of this sophisticated catalytic cycle largely relies on the appropriate rate226 7 Addressing the Substrate Limitation in the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

match of each elementary step. In particular, the selective oxidative addition of
aryl iodides with Pd(0) over electrophiles and the selective migratory insertion of
NBE with 7-1 over the direct coupling with nucleophiles are crucial for the overall
regioselectivity. Therefore, for a long period of time, the substrate scope is limited
to ortho-substituted aryl iodides. In this chapter, we will discuss recent advances
in addressing the substrate limitation in the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis [5].7.2 Ortho Constraint 227
7.2 Ortho Constraint
7.2.1 “Ortho Effect” and “Ortho Constraint”
Besides alkylation, ortho arylation has also been achieved to from various function￾alized diary compounds [5a]. However, when ortho-unsubstituted aryl halides were
used, a mixture of NBE-containing products was obtained (Scheme 7.3) [6]. Based
on experimental observations, Catellani et al. concluded that an ortho substituent
on the starting aryl halide was required for the selective and effective ortho C—H
arylation, which they referred as the “ortho effect.”

Scheme 7.3 Unselective arylation with 4-fluorobromobenzene.
A comprehensive DFT calculation revealed that there were two possible pathways
for the ortho arylation, i.e. transmetalation and Pd(IV) pathways, and the selectivity
was determined by the substitution pattern on the aryl moiety of ANP (Scheme 7.4)
[7]. When R = H, a dinuclear transmetalation was favored by 8–10 kcal/mol, yet in
an unselective manner as the energy difference between these two transmetalation
modes was small (1.5–2.0 kcal/mol). Subsequent reductive elimination would form
intermediates 7-11 and 7-13 as a mixture. Alternatively, when an ortho substituent
(R≠ H) was present in ANP, oxidative addition of an aryl halide was favored by
1–7 kcal/mol to form the Pd(IV) complex 7-14, followed by a selective C(sp2)–C(sp2)
reductive elimination (4–12 kcal/mol favored over C(sp2)–C(sp3) reductive elimina￾tion). Steric repulsion between the R group and NBE significantly increased the

barrier of transmetalation pathway in 7-14, while the Pd(IV) pathway remained to
have a similar barrier. Therefore, an ortho substituent in starting aryl halides was
crucial for the desired arylation reaction.
In 2015, the Yu group found that the C2-ester substituted NBE (NBE-2) was the
effective cocatalyst for the Catellani-type arylation of simple phenyl iodide, afford￾ing the 2,6-diarylated arenes in good yields (Scheme 7.5) [8]. The absence of the
“ortho effect” in this case is probably due to the increasing steric hindrance of the
norbornyl-Pd bond in ANP, which suppressed both the undesired transmetalation
and subsequent reductive elimination to form the quaternary center (7-11). In addi￾tion, the direct reductive elimination of ANP, which forms the benzocyclobutene as
a common side product in the Catellani reaction, was also suppressed by using this
structurally modified NBE cocatalyst. Note that in this case, bis ortho functionaliza￾tion (instead of mono ortho functionalization, vide infra) was the nearly exclusive
reaction pathway.

Scheme 7.5 Addressing the “ortho effect” with C2-ester-substituted NBE-2.
Except ortho arylation, for other Pd/NBE-catalyzed reactions, the ortho substi￾tution of the aryl halide starting materials is not always required. In Catellani’s
seminal catalytic work, the bis ortho alkylation product was obtained in high yield
when using simple phenyl iodide as the substrate [3]. Similarly, other dual ortho
C—H functionalization reactions under Pd/NBE catalysis, such as bisamination
[9], bisacylation [10], and bisglycosylation [11], can be achieved in good efficiency,
although bisalkoxycarbonylation remained sluggish in the absence of the ortho
substituent [12] (Table 7.1). In these reactions, electrophiles reacted selectively
with ANP instead of the Pd(0) complex, eliminating the possible transmetalation
side pathway. However, the ortho substituent remains indispensable in many
Pd/NBE-catalyzed reactions, including ortho thiolation [13], annulation with
epoxides [14] and aziridines [15], and various ipso functionalization reactions [5i].
From the synthetic standpoint, a selective mono-ortho C—H functionalization
from ortho-unsubstituted aryl halides would be more useful and practical to prepare
unsymmetrical arenes. However, this is quite challenging in the Pd/NBE catalysis
as ortho substituents play crucial roles in several fundamental steps of this compre￾hensive catalytic cycle (Scheme 7.2).
First of all, the steric repulsion between the ortho substituent (R group in 7-2) and
the NBE backbone facilitates the C—H palladation step to form the key ANP inter￾mediate. However, in the absence of the R group, the similar interaction between7.2 Ortho Constraint 229

the newly installed electrophile and the NBE (7-6, R = H) would favor the undesired
second C—H palladation, leading to the formation of the bisfunctionalized product
7-18 and some NBE-containing side products 7-19, 7-20 (Scheme 7.6). Additionally,
the equilibrium between 7-5 and 7-6 substantially favors the direction toward 7-6
only when R≠ H, which is supported by Catellani’s stoichiometric work [16]. In
other words, the NBE extrusion only occurs facilely when both ortho substituents

are present. Therefore, the presence of the ortho substituent is required in order to
achieve mono C—H functionalization, and this long-standing challenge is termed
as “ortho constraint” in the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis by Dong et al. [17]. Since
NBE cocatalysts participate in all aforementioned “problematic” steps, careful
tuning of steric and electronic properties of the NBE might provide a chance to
overcome this limitation.
7.2.2 Addressing the Ortho Constraint with Bridgehead-Substituted
NBEs
A breakthrough was reported by Dong and Liu groups in 2018, where a bridgehead￾substituted NBE was designed and employed to overcome the ortho constraint [17].
As discussed in the previous section, the key to achieving the mono C—H function￾alization is to realize a faster β–C elimination than the second C—H palladation for
intermediate 7-6 (R = H, Scheme 7.2).
Studies reported by Catellani and coworkers have shown the transition state for
the second C—H metalation, where the newly installed electrophile is oriented
toward the bridgehead position (7-21), and the β–C elimination becomes facile
only when both ortho positions are occupied [18]. Dong and coworkers proposed
that introducing a proper substituent at the bridgehead position would destabilize
the TS for the second C—H palladation and promote the desired NBE extrusion
through the added steric repulsion (Scheme 7.7) [17].

Scheme 7.7 Mechanistic considerations for addressing the ortho constraint.
This strategy proved to be successful, and several bridgehead-substituted NBEs
showed good reactivity, and more importantly, excellent selectivity toward mono
ortho functionalized products when 3-iodotoluene was employed as the substrate
(Table 7.2). With the increasing steric congestion around NBE cocatalysts, the migra￾tory insertion became slower, rendering the direct ipso Heck reaction the major
side pathway. They found out that NBEs with an alkyl substituent at the bridgehead
position (NBE-3,4,5) all effectively afforded the desired mono-aminated product
(7-25) with n-heptyl-substituted NBE-4 being optimal for 3-iodotoluene. Moreover,7.2 Ortho Constraint 231

bulkier substituents such as cyclohexyl-, phenyl-, and iso-propyl-substituted NBEs
(NBE-5,7,8) led to various amounts of the direct Heck side product 7-26.
The selected substrate scope is summarized in Table 7.3. Meta-substituted aryl
iodides with various FGs regardless of electronic properties afforded the desired
mono-amination products in good yields. Besides ortho-amination/ipso-Heck reac￾tion, otherfunctionalization reactions,such as ortho acylation, arylation, ipso hydro￾genation, arylation, and alkynylation, all can be achieved with appropriate reagents
in good yields and excellent selectivity under similar conditions.
Besides meta-substituted aryl iodides, Dong et al. also discovered that para￾substituted aryl iodide could undergo the mono ortho-amination with NBE-8 as the
cocatalyst (Scheme 7.8). Both electron-rich and -deficientstarting materials afforded
the desired products in synthetically useful yields and excellent mono/di selectivity.
As a nice extension of Dong’s works [17, 19], the Fernández-Ibáñez group
synthesized a series of C1- and C3-disubstituted NBEs and found out they were
effective cocatalysts for the mono meta C—H arylation of anisoles through the
Pd(II)-initiated Pd/NBE catalysis [20]. The C1-alkyl, C3-amide substituted NBEs
(NBE-12, NBE-13) showed substantially enhanced reactivity and selectivity for
both ortho-substituted and simple anisole substrates (Table 7.4). They further
demonstrated a sequential C—H diarylation protocol to synthesize unsymmetrical
meta-diarylated anisole derivatives in good overall yields (Table 7.5). NBE-13 was
the optimal cocatalyst for the mono meta-arylation of anisole and NBE-2 for the
subsequent arylation step based on Yu’s work [21].
Fernández-Ibáñez and coworkers also carried out some mechanistic investiga￾tions. First, the stoichiometric reaction among Pd(OAc)2, the S,O-ligand, NBE-2,
and anisole substrate afforded the NBE insertion adduct 7-55 in 71% yield and no
7-56 detected, indicating that the first electrophilic aromatic palladation occurred
at the para position of anisole (Scheme 7.9). Subsequent deprotonation with K2CO3
produced the five-membered palladacycle 7-57 in 92% yield. A crystal structure was
obtained and confirmed by X-ray crystallography when treating the palladacycle
with a phenanthroline ligand (7-58). Finally, both complexes 7-55 and 7-57 proved to
be catalytically active for meta C—H arylation of anisoles, albeit with poor mono/di
selectivity (Scheme 7.10).232 7 Addressing the Substrate Limitation in the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

7.2.3 Annulation with the C7-Modified NBE
In 2021, Liu, Wang, and Dong reported a 7-bromosubstituted NBE to overcome
the ortho constraint in Catellani-type annulation reactions [22]. The annulation
between 1-chloro-3-iodobenzene and O-benzoyl hydroxylamine tethering a termi￾nal olefin was chosen as the model reaction to form tetrahydrobenzo[b] azepines
(THBAs) as the desired product (Table 7.6). NBE-4, known to promote the mono
C—H functionalization, only afforded the desired annulated product in 19% yield
with benzocyclobutene as the major side product in this case. This is probably
due to the increased steric hindrance of the secondary acyclic amine electrophile,
rendering it less reactive with the ANP intermediate. C2-carbonyl-substituted
NBEs (NBE-2 and NBE-15) could suppress the formation of benzocyclobutene;
however, they were not capable of overcoming the ortho constraint. Less than 30%
of the desired product was obtained by employing these two NBE cocatalysts, with
substantial bisamination side products observed. Interestingly, the Dong group
uncovered 7-bromosubstituted NBE-18 to be highly reactive and selective toward
the desired annulation product. Other NBEs with C7-chloro, iodo, or -alkoxy
substituents gave much inferior results. The anti-bromonorbornene NBE-20 only
afforded 8% of the desired product, indicating the inductive effect of the bromo
group alone might not account for the superior performance of NBE-18.
Through experimental and computational mechanistic studies, they concluded
that the weakly coordinating bromo group in NBE-18 acted as a “built-in” L-type7.2 Ortho Constraint 235

ligand, which might affect several fundamental steps in the catalytic cycle: firstly,
the reductive elimination TS of the NBE-18-derived ANP (INT 7.61) was found to
be 4.6 kcal/mol higher in energy than that of the simple NBE (Scheme 7.11). This
is probably due to the electrical repulsion between the negatively charged bromine
atom with the arene π electrons in TS 7-62. Moreover, the presence of the bromo
substituent did not affect the reaction between the ANP and the bulky amine elec￾trophile as the energy difference of the oxidative addition transition state (TS 7-64)
was negligible between simple NBE and NBE-18. In other words, bromo-containing
NBE-18 could effectively suppressthe benzocyclobutene formation but not compro￾mise the corresponding ANP reactivity toward the bulky amine electrophile.
The chemoselectivity-determining NBE extrusion and subsequent 7-exo-trig
cyclization were studied computationally as well. As the cyclization showed a
higher energy barrier than the β-carbon elimination in this reaction, NBE extrusion
can be treated as a pre-equilibrium. The steric repulsion between the bromo group
and the arene ortho C—H bond (H⋅⋅⋅Br distance: 2.66 Å) was proposed to be
responsible for the faster 7-exo-trig by driving the NBE extrusion pre-equilibrium.
With the optimal NBE in hand, the Dong group further explored the sub￾strate scope and prepared various structurally diverse THBAs using this method
(Table 7.7). Notably, the product mixture can be isomerized exclusively to the
thermodynamically more stable endo product under acidic conditions.
7.2.4 Hybrid Cycloolefin Ligand Strategy
In 2022, the Jiao group reported a hybrid cycloolefin ligand containing a cyclopen￾tene ring tethering a Lewis basic group to replace both the phosphine ligand and
NBE cocatalyst in conventional Catellani-type reactions [23]. They showed that the
classic ortho-alkylation/ipso-Heck reaction of aryl iodides could be realized using Pd
and cyclopentene L3 as the catalyst in excellent efficiency (Scheme 7.12a).236 7 Addressing the Substrate Limitation in the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

More recently, the same group has demonstrated the ortho-alkylation of ortho￾unsubstituted aryl iodides by employing appropriate coordinating groups on the
cycloolefin scaffold [24]. A thioether-derived cyclopentene containing an NHAc
group proved to be optimal, promoting both reactivity and selectivity for the mono
ortho alkylated products over the dialkylation pathway. As shown in Table 7.8,
various ortho-unsubstituted aryl iodides reacted to form the desired mono-alkylated
products in synthetically useful yields. Additionally, mono C—H methylation
with phenyltrimethylammonium iodide salt [19] can be achieved under similar
conditions to assemble functionalized toluene derivatives.7.3 Meta Constraint 237

7.3 Meta Constraint
As discussed in the previoussection, the presence of ortho substituentsin aryl iodide
substrates is often required for classic Catellani-type reactions (Scheme 7.12b). In
addition, the meta (C4) position remains to be unsubstituted in most literature
reports for this type of catalysis, with a few exceptions containing small meta
substituents or tethered meta electrophiles.
For example, Lautens et al. developed an annulation reaction between aryl iodides
and olefin-tethered alkyl halidesto assemble fused aromatic rings underthe Pd/NBE
catalysisin 2001 [25]. In this work, polysubstituted aryl iodides were examined, with
three examples containing relatively small meta-substituents, i.e. fluoro, chloro, and
methoxy groups (Scheme 7.13).238 7 Addressing the Substrate Limitation in the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

Scheme 7.13 Annulation of aryl iodides with meta-substituents.
The Lautens group later demonstrated an ortho-bisalkylation/ipso-hydrogenation
protocol through the slow addition of isopropylboronic acid [26]. Meta-substituted
aryl iodides were generally less reactive and only meta-fluoro and meta-chloro
iodobenzenes delivered the desired bisalkylated products (Scheme 7.14). Substrates
bearing other meta substituents, such as methyl, trifluoromethyl, and sulfonamide
groups, were not suitable.
In 2006, the Catellani group showed that the α-enolizable ketones could serve as a
nucleophile in the Pd/NBE catalysis to introduce the alkyl group to the ipso position
[27]. They realized ortho-arylation/ipso-alkylation of aryl iodides with ketones and

Scheme 7.16 Ortho trifluoroethylation of an aryl iodide with a meta-fluoro substituent.
Another approach to achieve ortho C—H functionalization in the presence of
meta substituents is to tether the electrophile onto the meta position, as described
in Chapter 1. Pioneered by the Lautens group, this strategy has been widely used in
preparing fused aromatic ring scaffolds. In 2003, Lautens and coworker developed a
three-component coupling of aryl halides tethering meta-electrophile, olefins, and
alkyl halides to assemble a variety of benzofused oxacycles in a modular manner
with high efficiency [29]. Diverse ring sizes, such as 5-, 6-, and 7-membered fused
rings, were constructed in good yields (Scheme 7.17).

chains containing both electrophiles and olefins at the meta position could react
smoothly in an intramolecular manner to form the complex tricycles in a single
step (Table 7.9) [31], showcasing the great synthetic potential of this cooperative
catalysis.
Except small substituents and tethered electrophiles, other meta-substituents,
such as even non-complexing methyl group [26] or moderately electron-withdrawing
ester group [25], could greatly inhibit the Catellani-type reactions. Challenges
associated with the meta-substituents in the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis are
threefold: firstly, compared to meta-unsubstituted aryl iodides, the increased steric
hindrance would render the key C—H palladation step more difficult via the
concerted-metalation-deprotonation (CMD) mechanism. Additionally, even if the
ANP could form, the steric bulkiness around ANP would hinder its reaction with
the electrophile, which could promote the direct reductive elimination to form the
benzocyclobutene side product. Finally, the meta-substituent might lead to an unse￾lective reductive elimination of the Pd(IV)intermediate (complex 7.4 in Scheme 7.2),
introducing the electrophile onto the norbornyl moiety. Such a limitation has been
termed as the “meta constraint” by the Dong group (Scheme 7.19) [32].

7.3.1 Addressing the Meta Constraint with the C2-Amide-Substituted
NBE
In 2021, Dong and coworkers reported a general solution to address the meta
constraint by identifying the appropriate structurally modified NBE as the active
cocatalyst [32]. The aryl iodide bearing a relatively large isopropyl group at the C4
meta position was chosen as the model substrate and a variety of NBE derivatives
were prepared and tested for the reactivity as shown in Table 7.10.
Simple NBE, C1, or C7-substituted NBEs (NBE-4 and NBE-21) performed poorly,
with simple NBE producing 19% of the desired product, 13% ipso-Heck product and
benzocyclobutene as the major product. It was proposed that C2-subsituted NBEs
would inhibit the unproductive benzocyclobutene formation and promote the
selectivity over ipso-Heck pathway by introducing a moderately electron-deficient
alkene in the NBE scaffold. Indeed, when NBE-2 was used, the yield was boosted to
40% with 55% ipso-Heck side product. Interestingly, the yield was further improved
to 63% and more importantly the selectivity was greatly enhanced when an amide
substituent was added to the NBE C2 position (NBE-25). Through the systematic
tuning of sterics around the amide functionality, they found the C2-N-methyl
amide-substituted NBE-15 (developed by the Dong group for the alkenyl Catellani
reaction, vide infra) was optimal for this transformation and only 18% direct Heck
side product was observed.
With the optimized NBE cocatalyst in hand, a variety of 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted
arenes were synthesized through the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis (Table 7.11).

Substrates bearing various meta substituents such as methyl, ethyl, phenyl,
electron-withdrawing carbonyl, cyano, bromo, and electron-donating dialkylamino
groups all reacted smoothly to afford corresponding polyfunctionalized arenes
in good efficiency. Ortho-unsubstituted aryl iodides reacted as well to produce
dialkylated products in the presence of various meta substituents.
The same team then carried out both experimental and computational mecha￾nistic investigations to study the role of the NBE amide moiety in the context of
addressing the “meta constraint.” For the chemoselectivity of the Catellani over the
ipso-Heck pathway, the selectivity-determining step is the competitive migratory
insertion of acylate versus NBE, which was studied via DFT calculation as shown in
Scheme 7.20.It appearsthat more electron-deficient or bulkier olefins bound weaker

amide groups led to higher overall migratory insertion energy barriers. A similar
trend was observed for moderately electron-withdrawing substituents, such as
CONHMe, CO2Me, and COMe, with the least electron-poor amide-containing
NBEs rendering faster migratory insertion (ΔG‡ Int 7-130). Notably, the rate of
olefin insertion (ΔG‡ Int 7-130 – ΔG 7-129) for CONHMe-substituted NBE-15 was
even faster than simple NBE. This is due to the accelerating effect of the amide
group in the aryl addition step, although it required slightly more energy to
approach the metal center. Hence, the CONHMe substituent balanced the opposite
electronic requirements of NBE binding and insertion steps and displayed the
optimal reactivity and selectivity.
Kinetics studies indicated the ortho C—H palladation being the turnover-limiting
step (TLS), consistent with the DFT calculation. The computational studies also
suggested a hydrogen bonding interaction between the N—H bond of the amide
moiety and the oxygen of the 5-CF3-2-pyridinol which was evidenced by the short
H⋅⋅⋅O distance (2.24 Å) and the bond angle (145.7∘). This hydrogen bonding interac￾tion further stabilized the CMD TS as compared to that of the C2-ester-substituted
NBE-2.
In conclusion, the merits of the NHMe amide moiety on NBE-15 could be three￾fold: (i) inhibition of the benzocyclobutene side product formation; (ii) balance of
steric and electronic requirements for the migratory insertion; (iii) stabilization of
the CMD step through the hydrogen bonding interaction.
7.4 Aryl Iodide Constraint
As discussed in Section 7.1, the success of the three-component Catellani reaction
relies on the orthogonal reactivity of two electrophilic species and two nucleophilic
Pd complexes, i.e. the selective oxidative addition of Pd(0) with aryl halides over the
exogenous electrophile E–X and the selective reaction between E–X and aryl halide244 7 Addressing the Substrate Limitation in the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

substrates when reacting with ANP (Scheme 7.21). Therefore, since the seminal
reports on ortho-alkylation with alkyl iodides, significant efforts have been put into
finding the appropriate electrophile/oxidant (E–X) so that it would selectively react
with ANP to introduce FGs onto ortho positions. For a comprehensive summary of
the electrophile exploration, please refer to Chapter 3 for details.
On the other hand, the substrates used in these reactions have been mostly
restricted to aryl iodides, which is referred as the “aryl iodide constraint” in the
Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis (Scheme 7.22). The fact that only aryl iodides work
well in Catellani reactions seems surprising, as aryl bromides and even chlorides
are competent substrates for Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions [33]. It is well
known that the oxidative addition of Pd(0) with aryl bromides is much slower as
compared to aryl iodides [34], which leads to a competitive oxidative addition of
Pd(0) with the exogenous electrophile E–X. Therefore, it is not trivial to directly
replace aryl iodides in Catellani reactions and efforts to address this substrate
limitation are discussed in this section.

Aryl sulfonates, especially triflates, also known as pseudo halides, have been widely
employed in transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions [35]. It is well
known that aryl triflates undergo facile oxidative addition with Pd(0), and the rate
is somewhat between aryl iodides and bromides [36]. Additionally, aryl triflates
can be prepared directly from phenols through high-yielding sulfonation reactions7.4 Aryl Iodide Constraint 245

[35a], offering a complementary coupling partner in arylation reactions. Thus, it is
attractive to develop aryl triflates as alternative substrates in Catellani reactions.
In 2011, the Lautens group reported the first Pd/NBE-catalyzed annulation of aryl
triflates with aryl imines bearing ortho-halo substituents via the ortho-arylation/
ipso-imination reaction (Table 7.12) [37]. A variety of ortho-substituted aryl triflates,
derived from readily available phenols, were converted to highly functionalized
phenanthridines in good yields. Notably, the phenanthridine product 7-141, a
synthetic precursor for Nitidine, was prepared in 88% yield, showcasing the
great synthetic potential of this method. Later, the same group demonstrated
the more classic three-component Catellani reaction of the aryl triflate, i.e.
ortho-alkylation/ipso-Heck reaction (Scheme 7.23), although only one aryl triflate
substrate was reported for this transformation [38]. These two reports represent the
early success in employing aromatic sulfonate substrates in the Pd/NBE catalysis.
In 2019, De Borggraeve and coworker discovered aryl fluorosulfates could act
as competent substrates for the Pd/NBE-catalyzed ortho-alkylation/ipso-Suzuki
coupling to assemble densely functionalized biaryls (Table 7.13) [39]. They

demonstrated electron-deficient sulfonates such as fluorosulfates and triflates
could deliver the desired product 7-143 in good yields and excellent selectivity over
the Catellani arylation side product 7-144. Less reactive mesylate did not afford
any desired product and the aryl bromide reacted albeit with lower reactivity.
Additionally, the Catellani-arylation pathway dominated when employing the aryl
iodide substrate, probably due to the competitive oxidative addition of aryl iodides
with the ANP intermediate.
They also disclosed a one-pot fluorosulfation-Catellani reaction protocol to
directly convert phenol derivatives to valuable functionalized products without the

On the other hand, aryl bromides are generally cheaper and more readily available
than corresponding iodides and triflates. Thus, a general and efficient ipso/ortho
difunctionalization of aryl bromides via the Pd/NBE catalysis would be appealing.
In Dong’s ortho-amination work [9], they demonstrated that methyl 2-bromo￾benzoate could undergo ortho-amination/ipso-hydrogenation to afford the aryl
amine product 7-151 in 53% yield (Scheme 7.25).

In 2018, Dong and coworkers reported a general method for utilizing diverse
aryl bromides as substrates in Catellani reactions [41]. They proposed fine-tuning
of steric and electronic properties of the Pd(0) catalyst would selectively accelerate
certain steps in the catalytic cycle, such as the oxidative addition and β-carbon
elimination (NBE extrusion) and enable aryl bromide competent substrates.
In their work, 2-bromoanisole was chosen as the model substrate and
ipso-hydrogenation was selected as the model reaction. Based on their previ￾ous success in Catellani-amination of aryl iodides [9], the Dong group identified
the major side product (7-152) when employing the aryl bromide substrate, which
indicated that the β-carbon elimination was slower than the hydride transfer
and the subsequent reductive elimination. Thus, they examined a series of bulky
secondary alcohols as the hydride source and found out that (−)-borneol was a
superior reductant.
A systematic screening of phosphine ligands was then carried out with borneol
as the hydride source (Table 7.15). Triarylphosphines, regardless of electronic248 7 Addressing the Substrate Limitation in the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

of premature reduction side product was formed as well. Yields were boosted
to 65–75% when more electron-rich trialkylphosphines were applied, except for
the extremely bulky tri-tert-butylphosphine. More importantly, these ligands
substantially suppressed the side product 7-152 formation. A series of bidentate
phosphine ligands were then examined, and ligands with flexible backbones (dppb
and DPEphos) performed much better than those with rigid backbones (Xantphos,
dppBz, and BINAP). Inspired by the results of trialkylphosphines and bidentate
phosphines, they further tested various bidentate trialkyl phosphines and found out
dCypb asthe optimal ligand with only a trace amount ofside product 7-152 detected.
With the optimal ligand in hand, the scope of ortho-amination/ipso-hydrogenation
wasthen investigated (Table 7.16). Various aryl bromides bearing ortho-substituents7.4 Aryl Iodide Constraint 249

could undergo difunctionalization reactions to afford the desired aniline derivatives
in good yields. Moreover, through the slight modification of reaction conditions,
ortho-acylation and ortho-alkylation with concurrent ipso-Heck reactions were
achieved with aryl bromide substrates. To date, this protocol remains the most
general difunctionalization method for aryl bromides via the Pd/NBE cooperative
catalysis.
Later in 2018, the Cushman group disclosed an annulation reaction between two
distinct aryl bromides via the ortho-arylation/ipso-amidation to assemble various
benzo[1,6] naphthyridinones (Scheme 7.26) [42]. The selectivity issue associated
with aryl bromides was wisely avoided through the judicious substrate design. The
low valent Pd(0) complex would prefer to undergo oxidative addition with more

electron-deficient aryl bromide 7-165 instead of bulkier 7-166. In addition, the
Lewis acidic ANP intermediate would react faster with the aryl bromide bearing the
ortho-directing group 7-166. Therefore, the cross-annulation product was obtained
selectively in this case.
Besides ortho-amination, the Dong group demonstrated the ortho-oxygenation
/ipso-Heck reaction of aryl bromides in 2023 [43]. The development of a novel N–O
reagent, which could selectively react with the ANP instead of the Pd(0) complex,
enables the effective ortho-oxygenation of aryl bromides (Table 7.17). A diverse
range of anisole derivatives were prepared using this method.
Besides the aforementioned reports, there are some miscellaneous examples in
the literature where aryl bromides were tested but often displayed inferior reac￾tivity than corresponding iodides (Scheme 7.27). For instance, in Lautens’ ortho￾annulation/ipso-cyanation work, both iodo- and bromoarene substrates were

Scheme 7.27 Miscellaneous examples utilizing aryl bromides.7.5 Beyond Aromatic Substrates 251
investigated under the same conditions, and unsurprisingly, aryl iodides
outperformed bromides in all cases [30]. A similar trend was observed for ortho￾annulation/ipso-alkenylation of aryl halides with a carbene precursor by the Liang
group [44], except for the benzoxepine product. Additionally, Zhou and coworkers
reported an elegant ortho-methylation/ipso-functionalization protocol utilizing
readily available methyl tosylate as the methylating agent [45]. Significantly lower
reactivity of 1-bromonapthelene was observed as compared to the iodo counterpart.
Besides aryl (pseudo)halides, some other aromatic compounds were reported
to be suitable substrates for Pd/NBE-catalyzed difunctionalization reactions. For
example, Dai and coworkers disclosed a decarbonylative functionalization of aryl
thioesters with alkyl bromides and various nucleophiles [46]. In addition, groups of
Zhang [47] and Zhou [48] have independently realized the Pd(II)-initiated difunc￾tionalization reactions of aryl boron species(for detailed discussions,see Chapter 5).
7.5 Beyond Aromatic Substrates
Analogous to aromatic halides, alkenyl (pseudo)halides have also been widely
employed as coupling partners in transition metal-catalyzed reactions [35a, 49]. It
would be straightforward to imagine that alkenyl halides might serve as competent
substrates in the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis. Such Catellani-type reactions
of alkenyl halides would provide an efficient and modular synthetic route to
tetrasubstituted alkenes (Scheme 7.28), which could be challenging to prepare
otherwise [50].

After the oxidative addition of bromoalkene and the following migratory insertion
with NBE, Int 7-178 could undergo 3-exo-trig cyclization and subsequent reduction
to afford the cyclopropane product, or a direct reduction to form 7-177.
This example clearly indicated a major challenge associated with alkenyl halide
substrates. That is, compared to the aryl Catellani reaction, the π bond of the olefin
substrate was much more reactive toward the undesired cyclopropanation reaction.
For alkenyl halides containing allylic hydrogens, this side pathway would be irre￾versible after β-hydrogen elimination [52]. On the other hand, alkenyl bromides or
triflates are more available than the corresponding iodides, but they are clearly more
challenging substrates as discussed previously in this chapter.
7.5.1 Partially Aromatic Substrates
In 2006, Lautens and coworkers demonstrated a Pd/NBE-catalyzed annulation via
ortho-alkylation/ipso-C—H-arylation [53]. Besides using aryl iodides, a single par￾tially aromatic substrate, iodo-uracil, was reported to afford the annulated product
7-179 only in moderate yield (Scheme 7.30).

(Scheme 7.31) [54]. Ortho-arylation/ipso-etherification or amination was realized
under similar conditions to produce a wide range of polyheterocyclic compounds in
good yields. One example of 4-iodocoumarin was reported to react as well, affording
the corresponding annulated heterocycle 7-180 in 82% yield.
Besides annulation reactions, the more general three-component Catellani
reaction of partially aromatic halides was disclosed by the Zhou group in 2021
[55]. They found that the NHMe-amide-substituted NBE-15, discovered previously
by the Dong group for the alkenyl Catellani reactions (vide infra), was crucial
in promoting the ortho-alkylation/ipso-alkenylation of iodopyridone substrates.
A wide range of FGs were tolerated and various difunctionalization, including
ortho-alkylation, arylation and ipso-hydrogenation, Suzuki reaction, alkynylation
were achieved under similar conditions to afford densely functionalized pyridone
derivatives in good yields (Table 7.18). Besides iodopyridones, iodochromones
proved to be competent substrates as well for the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis,
affording difunctionalized flavones and isoflavones [56].
7.5.2 𝜶-Alkylation and Arylation of Alkenyl Triflates and Bromides
In 2019, the Dong group disclosed the first Catellani-type difunctionalization
of nonaromatic alkenyl halides and triflates [19]. Simple cyclohexenyl bromide
was chosen as the model substrate and ortho-alkylation/ipso-Heck quench as the
model reaction (Table 7.19). When NBEs bearing no, C1, C5, or C7 substituent
were employed, the corresponding cyclopropane 7-186 was observed as the major
product. They proposed that C2-substituted NBE would suppress the unproductive254 7 Addressing the Substrate Limitation in the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

3-exo-trig cyclization by increasing the steric congestion in the transition state,
forming the cyclopropane ring with two consecutive quaternary centers. Indeed, the
presence of a C2-substituent effectively inhibited the cyclopropane formation and
the C2-amide-containing NBE showed significantly enhanced reactivity toward the
desired difunctionalization product. Systematic tuning of the steric and electronic
properties of the amide moiety revealed that NBE-15 bearing the C2-NHMe amide
group was optimal in promoting Catellani-type difunctionalization of cyclic alkenyl
halides. The disclosure of C2-amide NBE-15 also inspired some other transforma￾tions in the field, including the aforementioned Catellani reactions of aryl iodides
bearing meta-substituents [32] and partially aromatic iodides [55].
The substrate scope for this transformation has also been explored (Table 7.20).
A variety of alkyl iodide electrophiles and activated olefins could be selectively cou￾pled with alkenyl triflates at the α- and ipso positions, respectively, affording the
corresponding tetrasubstituted alkene products in good yields. Besides cyclohex￾enyl triflates, five- and seven-membered cyclic alkenyl triflates as well as acyclic
olefinic bromides also reacted to form alkenes with various backbones. In addition
to classic 𝛼-alkylation/ipso-Heck reactions, other difunctionalization reactions such
α-arylation, ipso-Suzuki coupling, hydrogenation, and annulation all could be real￾ized under slightly modified conditions, delivering a diverse range of polyfunction￾alized olefin products.7.5 Beyond Aromatic Substrates 255

7.5.3 𝛂-Amination of Alkenyl Triflates: Formal Carbonyl
1,2-Transposition
Based on their previous success in developing the Catellani-amination [9]
and alkenyl Catellani reaction [19], the Dong group further demonstrated the
α-amination/ipso-hydrogenation of alkenyl triflates derived from cyclic ketones,
to realize a formal carbonyl 1,2-transposition. Such a transformation previously
required multistep synthetic sequences and suffered from substrate specificity and
regioselectivity [57]. Dong and coworkers proposed that enol triflate-mediated
α-amination/ipso-hydrogenation would directly afford the transposed enam￾ine intermediate, which could undergo in situ hydrolysis to give the carbonyl
1,2-migrated product.
The challenges of developing the α-amination/ipso-hydrogenation of alkenyl
triflates can be seen in the following aspects. Besides the cyclopropanation side
product, the premature reduction would be another major side reaction in the pres￾ence of the stoichiometric amount of hydride source as shown in Scheme 7.29 [51].
Therefore, they proposed that a bulky hydride source, particularly those that could
release hydride slowly, would be beneficial to prevent early hydride termination.
As a result, they designed and identified bifunctional carbonate-based reagents
bearing both electrophilic amine moiety and bulky masked hydride as effective
H/N donors, enabling the desired α-amination/ipso-hydrogenation to occur [58].256 7 Addressing the Substrate Limitation in the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

As shown in Table 7.21, a variety of H/N donors and NBEs were investigated
for the one-pot carbonyl 1,2-migration of the α-tetralone substrate. A mild and
high-yielding triflation method was first developed, which was compatible with the
subsequent Pd/NBE catalysis. The bifunctional H/N donor derived from piperidine
and steric hindered alkyl carbonate (R8) was proved to be superior. A systematic
survey of NBE cocatalysts was then carried out, particularly for the C2-substituted
ones. The NHMe-amide-containing NBE-15, previously optimal for the alkenyl
triflate difunctionalizations, only provided the desired product in moderate yield.
Azetidine-amide-containing NBE (NBE-31) was found to work the best for the
𝛼-tetralone substrate, and the unique reactivity and selectivity of this cocatalyst was
more evident in the more challenging substrates, such as non-conjugated alkenyl
triflates (Table 7.22).
A wide range of cyclic ketones were converted to the desired carbonyl-migrated
products using this method in one pot or two steps. α-Tetralones (7-199-202),
1-indanone (7-203), and a substituted benzocycloheptenone (7-204) all reacted
smoothly under the one-pot protocol, affording carbonyl 1,2-shifted products in
moderate to good yields. More challenging non-conjugated alkenyl triflates, such
as the one derived from 4-phenylcyclohexanone only delivered the product 7-205
in 37% yield. The overall efficiency was improved when purification of the triflate
intermediate was carried out. Such a two-step protocol was then employed for
non-conjugated substrates. Cyclohexanones (7-205-209) and cyclopentanones
(7-210) bearing various substituents and FGs proved to be competent substrates. In
addition, this method allowed rapid access to unusual bioactive analogs through
late-stage functionalization (7-211-214).7.5 Beyond Aromatic Substrates 257

7.5.4 𝛂-Carbamoylation of Alkenyl Triflates
Wu and Dong further extended the alkenyl Catellani reaction to the 𝛼-carbamoyl￾ation to access multisubstituted acrylamides from cyclic ketones [59]. They found
that readily available carbamoyl chlorides are effective carbamoylating reagents and
phosphafluorene ligand L2 is superior to other phosphine ligands. As summarized
in Table 7.23, the fine-tuning of the sterics around the NBE C2-amide moiety was
again proved to be crucial.C2-ester or primary amide-substituted NBEs could deliver
the desired product 7-214, though generating a substantial amount of side prod￾ucts from ipso-Heck reaction or homo-coupling. The yield and selectivity were both
improved by employing either NBE-15 or NBE-31, producing 57% and 52% of the258 7 Addressing the Substrate Limitation in the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

desired product, respectively. Surprisingly, NBEs bearing bulky secondary amide
moieties displayed remarkably high reactivity and selectivity (NBE-26, 34, 35), with
the exact reason remaining to be discovered. They proposed that the sterically hin￾dered substituent on the amide moiety may promote the C—H palladation step due
to the buttressing effect [60], but not hamper the NBE insertion step as the N–H side
of the amide remained open. Notably, NBE-34 was more reactive and selective than
NBE-26 and NBE-35 for more challenging nonconjugated alkenyl triflate substrates.
The representative scope for forming multisubstituted acrylamide products is
illustrated in Table 7.24. Various ipso-functionalization reactions, such as Heck
reaction, Suzuki reaction, Sonogashira reaction, hydride quench, C—H arylation,
and tandem annulation were realized under similar conditions.
7.5.5 Distal Alkenyl C—H Bond Functionalization
Pioneered by Bach [61], Yu [8] [62], Dong [63], Zhang [47], Zhou [48] and others
[5h], Pd(II)-initiated Catellani-type reactions have become a unique tool for
site-selective C—H functionalizations (for detailed discussions, see Chapter 5). In
2020, Dong and coworkers reported the distal alkenyl C—H functionalization via
the Pd(II)-initiated Catellani-type reaction [64]. They proposed that a directed C—H
activation would give the six-membered palladacycle Int 7-227, followed by the
NBE insertion to form Int 7-228. Analogous to ANP, the second C—H palladation
would form the alkenyl-norbornyl palladacycle 7-229, which could react with an
electrophile to functionalize the distal C—H bond and afford the trisubstituted
alkene upon NBE extrusion and protodepalladation (Scheme 7.32).
Various cis-olefins bearing oxime ethers or aminopyridines as DGs (directing
groups) reacted smoothly with aryl iodides to afford the arylated product in good7.5 Beyond Aromatic Substrates 259

the same group further demonstrated alkenyl C—H alkylation with methyl iodide

additional dative ligand, i.e. methyl-2-picolinate, was found crucial in promoting

7.6 Conclusions and Outlook
In the past decade, several key limitations of the Catellani-type reactions have been
addressed through careful catalyst, NBE, and ligand design. To date, both the reac￾tion and substrate scope of the Pd/NBE catalysis have been substantially expanded,
from the conventional ortho-substituted aryl iodides to aryl halides and pseudo￾halides with various substitution patterns and even nonaromatic alkenyl triflates.
Such developments in the Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis have made this domino
reaction a more powerful tool in the synthesis of complex molecules. There is no
doubt that the further understanding of the catalytic cycle will guide the develop￾ment of new NBE cocatalysts toward more efficient and selective transformations.
It is anticipated that the capability of the Pd/NBE chemistry will continue to expand,
e.g. to realize the activation of C(sp3)—H bonds, in the next few decades.

Application of the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative
Catalysis to Synthesis of Natural Products and Materials

8.1 Applications in Synthesis of Natural Products
and Drugs
Total synthesis and the development of synthetic methodologies are intimately
intertwined, constituting a perpetual focus in the realm of organic chemistry. This
interplay is underscored by the profound influence that state-of-the-art reaction
methodologies have on the design of total synthesis strategies. The overall synthetic
efficiency of a given route is predominantly dictated by the key reactions employed.
Polysubstituted aromatics are ubiquitously found in the realm of pharmaceuticals
and agrochemicals. The utilization of Pd/norbornene (NBE) cooperative catalysis
has demonstrated its prowess in the rapid synthesis of polysubstituted aromatics.
In this section, we provide an overview of the recent advancements in the synthesis
of natural products and drugs via Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis.
8.1.1 Synthesis Using Ortho Functionalization of Aryl Halides
The Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis has garnered widespread recognition for its
remarkable utility in the synthesis of bioactive compounds. Particularly notable
are the ortho/ipso bisfunctionalizations of aryl iodides, which offer a highly robust
approach for the strategic assembly of poly-substituted arenes with exceptional
site-selectivity and remarkable step economy. Within this section, these examples
are summarized according to the type of the ortho functionalization employed in
their key step (Table 8.1).
As a three-component coupling reaction, the Pd/NBE catalysis can give cyclized
products if at least two of the coupling partners are linked together (see Chapter
1 for more details). This process leads to four distinct types of transformations,
determined by how these three components are linked: (Figure 8.1) Type A occurs
when the electrophile and termination nucleophile are separate and not linked266 8 Application of the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

the termination nucleophile. Type C takes place when aryl iodides are linked with
the termination nucleophile. Type D is a variant to Type A, where the electrophile
and termination nucleophile are separate, but in this case, the initial product can
undergo additional downstream reactions to form benzofused rings.8.1 Applications in Synthesis of Natural Products and Drugs 267

8.1.1.1 Synthesis Using Ortho Alkylation Reactions
The ortho alkylation of aryl iodides is a widely employed strategy in the synthe￾sis of natural products and pharmaceuticals. This method allows for the simulta￾neous construction of two valuable C—C bonds, rapidly increasing the molecular
complexity.
Linoxepin is a lignan that has been isolated from the aerial parts of Linum perenne
L. This unique molecule, a dimer of caffeic acid, possesses a dihydronaphthalene
core that is susceptible to oxidation. It also contains a tetrasubstituted double bond
embedded within a highly strained ring system and a dibenzo-dihydrooxepine
moiety, which is rare in this class of compounds. In 2013, Lautens and cowork￾ers successfully achieved the enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-linoxepin
(Figure 8.2) [1, 2]. They efficiently constructed the tetrasubstituted arene core 8.3
using the Type A ortho alkylation/ipso Heck reaction. Subsequent oxidative cleavage
of the olefin to an aldehyde, followed by intramolecular aldol condensation, yielded
8.4. Finally, the Mizoroki−Heck reaction was employed to complete the synthesis
of (+)-linoxepin (8.5).
Type B ortho alkylation reactions offer a remarkably efficient strategy for gener￾ating fused ring structures. Epoxides serve as excellent Type B-coupling partners268 8 Application of the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

due to their dual nature, possessing both electrophilic alkyl moieties and nucle￾ophilic oxygen functionalities. In 2017, the Dong group employed the annulation
reaction with epoxides to synthesize fufenozide, an exceptional insect growth regu￾lator exhibiting potent insecticidal activity against plutella, xylostella, and mythimna
(Figure 8.3) [3]. By directly coupling aryl iodide 8.6 with propylene oxide 8.7, they
efficiently constructed dihydrobenzofuran 8.8 in 85% yield. Subsequent hydrolysis
and amide condensation elegantly led to the synthesis of fufenozide (8.9) in just
three steps, underscoring the synthetic utility of this approach.
In 2018, Zhou and coworkers employed their Type B ortho alkylation/ipso
Heck annulation strategy to achieve a concise synthesis of eptazocine, a
benzomorphan-type analgesic drug (Figure 8.4) [4]. This approach involved
the reaction of aryl iodide 8.10 with bromo-allyl alcohol 8.11, resulting in the
formation of aldehyde 8.12 in 53% yield. Subsequent conversion of the aldehyde
to the secondary amine 8.13 through reductive amination paved the way for the
subsequent steps. Further CrO3-mediated benzylic oxidation/Mannich reaction
led to the formation of the tricyclic core 8.14. Ultimately, a simultaneous benzyl
deprotection and ketone reduction successfully yielded the racemic eptazocine
(8.15).
Likewise, in 2019, the same Type B ortho alkylation/ipso Heck annulation
approach was employed to synthesize Ramelteon (8.19), a renowned drug devel￾oped by Takeda and approved by the FDA in 2005 for the treatment of insomnia.
The synthesis involved the reaction of aryl iodide 8.16 with bromo-allyl alcohol
8.17, resulting in the formation of aldehyde 8.18 with an impressive yield of 68%
(Figure 8.5) [5]. The aldehyde was then efficiently converted to Ramelteon through8.1 Applications in Synthesis of Natural Products and Drugs 269

compared to previous methods, highlighting its efficiency and practicality.
Psymberin, a cytotoxic natural product derived from the marine sponge
Psammocinia sp., exhibits remarkable antineoplastic activities. Through the
implementation of a Pd/NBE catalysis strategy, a concise four-step sequence was
successfully employed to access a synthetic intermediate for psymberin. In 2020,
Dong and colleagues demonstrated that aryl iodide 8.20 could undergo Type A
ortho alkylation/ipso Suzuki coupling, enabling the simultaneous installation of
two alkyl groups at the ortho and ipso positions (Figure 8.6) [6]. Unlike classical
Catellani reactions, which faced challenges when meta positions of aryl iodides
were substituted, they found that an amide-substituted NBE could overcome this
“meta constraint,” providing an entry to access 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted arenes.
Notably, although product 8.21 featured two methyl ester moieties, it was revealed
that the alkyl-derived ester group displayed greater reactivity. This selective reac￾tivity allowed for the chemoselective reduction of the alkyl-derived ester to the
corresponding aldehyde, completing the formal synthesis of psymberin.
Dalesconol A, initially discovered in the mantis-associated fungus Daldinia
eschscholzii, exhibits immunosuppressive activity comparable to the clinically
used cyclosporine A, but with reduced background cytotoxicity. Its structural
complexity arises from a highly oxygenated all-carbon framework comprising seven270 8 Application of the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

fused rings of varying sizes, presenting significant challenges in its synthesis. In
2021, Luan and coworkers employed their remarkable threefold domino reaction
of halo-biaryls with bromoalkyl alkynes as the key step in their synthetic route
(Figure 8.7) [7]. This domino reaction involved Type B ortho alkylation/ipso alkyne
insertion/dearomatization, followed by acid-induced deprotection and Michael
addition, resulting in the formation of the heptacyclic core (four rings were formed)
of dalesconol A in a single step with an impressive yield of 65%. Subsequent
selective benzylic oxidation, using NHPI, led to the production of compound 8.27
in 54% yield. Oxime condensation and global C–H hydroxylation were then carried
out to obtain the desired product 8.28. Finally, the completion of the total synthesis
of dalesconol A (8.29) was achieved through Stahl’s method of Pd(II)-catalyzed
oxidative desaturation.
(−)-Berkelic acid was obtained from an extremophilic Penicillium species col￾lected from the Berkeley Pit Lake in Montana, USA. This intriguing compound
exhibits selective and potent activity against OVCAR-3, an ovarian cancer cell line.
Structurally, it possesses an interesting tetracyclic isochroman/chroman spiroketal
framework and a pentasubstituted phenyl ring with a free hydroxy group. In
2021, Zhou successfully synthesized the key isochroman intermediate 8.33 with
a 67% yield (1.2 : 1 d.r.) using their Pd/NBE catalysis strategy [8, 9]. This strategy
involved the assembly of a simple aryl iodide 8.30, a chiral epoxide 8.31, and a
racemic enone 8.32, in a Type D ortho alkylation/ipso Heck/oxa-Michael reaction
cascade (Figure 8.8). Notably, a subsequent global deprotection of 8.33, followed
by acid-promoted spiroacetalization, furnished the desired tetracyclic intermediate
8.34 in 69% yield, showcasing excellent diastereoselectivity (>10 : 1 d.r.). Impres￾sively, during this transformation, four new chiral centers were either generated or
rearranged in 8.34. The stereoinformation of these four newly established chiral
centers originated from the chiral epoxide 8.31. Following this, an Appel iodination,
accompanied by a Ni-catalyzed reductive coupling, facilitated the synthesis of
(−)-berkelic acid methyl ester 8.35. Finally, through the selective saponification of
the methyl benzoate of 8.35 using (Bu3Sn)2O, (−)-berkelic acid (8.36) was obtained
in a 34% yield.Pd/C, H2, MeOH; TsOH BnO

Besides oxa-Michael addition between alcohols and olefins, such a Type D
cyclization can also occur between amines and alkynes. Isolated from Neilzlmbo
nucifera, (±)-stepharine and (±)-pronuciferine are two exemplary proaporphine
alkaloids featuring a tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) moiety and a spirocyclohexa￾dienone skeleton. In 2022, Zhou efficiently synthesized the key intermediate 8.40
using their ortho alkylation/ipso alkynylation reaction (Figure 8.9), employing
a simple aryl iodide 8.37, aziridine 8.38, and (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene 8.39
[10]. Subsequently, a Suzuki coupling, desilylation, and Ts deprotection sequence
led to the formation of intermediate 8.41. Further, an Au-catalyzed cyclization,
followed by a two-step protecting group manipulation, resulted in the formation
of 8.42. By subjecting 8.42 to PIDA-promoted oxidative dearomatization, followed
by reduction, (±)-stepharine (8.43) was obtained in 85% yield. Additionally, an
additional reductive amination afforded (±)-pronuciferine (8.44) in 90% yield.
This cascade reaction also offers a versatile approach to synthesize various
1,3-trans-disubstituted THIQs, including michellamine B, which was extracted
from the tropical liana Ancistrocladus korupensis. Biological studies have demon￾strated the potent anti-HIV activities of michellamine B. Structurally, michellamine
B features a naphthyltetrahydroisoquinoline skeleton with central chirality and
C−C axial chirality, along with a common 1,3-transdisubstituted THIQ motif.
In 2022, Zhou successfully synthesized the 1,3-trans-disubstituted THIQ core
in good yield using simple building blocks: aryl iodide 8.45, aziridine 8.46, and
terminal alkyne 8.39 (Figure 8.10) [11]. This was achieved through a Type D
ortho alkylation/ipso alkynylation and an Au-catalyzed cyclization/reduction
cascade. Iodination and Suzuki–Miyaura coupling steps led to the formation of the
desired axially chiral intermediates 8.48a and 8.48b. By employing a regioselective
iodination, aryl iodides 8.49 were obtained. Subsequently, a late-stage Negishi
coupling between 8.49 and the in situ-generated organozinc reagent 8.50 yielded
the key heterodimer. Finally, michellamine B (8.51) was obtained in excellent yield
by subjecting this heterodimer to the Pd/C hydrogenolysis. Likewise, the total
synthesis of michellamine C was also accomplished (not shown).8.1 Applications in Synthesis of Natural Products and Drugs 273

The scope of the above method was limited to the incorporation of the simplest
acetylene unit. NBS-mediated cyclization overcomes this constraint, enabling a
modular and efficient method to assemble 1-bromomethylene-THIQs. Cularine,
found in plants Dicentra and Corydalis, displays impressive bioactivities, including
anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anxiolytic effects. In 2023, Zhou efficiently
synthesized the key intermediate 8.53 employing a simple aryl iodide 8.52, aziridine
8.38, and (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene 8.39, through a Type D ortho alkylation/ipso
alkynylation and an NBS-mediated cyclization cascade [12]. Then, a conven￾tional Suzuki coupling yielded the 1-alkylidenyl-THIQ 8.54 with a high yield.
Simultaneous debenzylation and enamide reduction followed by a Pd-catalyzed
intramolecular etherification, produced the key tetracyclic intermediate 8.55 in 74%
yield. Ultimately, a facile deprotection and reductive amination sequence afforded
(±)-cularine in 81% yield (Figure 8.11). Similarly, dactyllactone A, isolated from
Dactylicapnos scandens, is an isoquinoline alkaloid exhibiting activity against the
expression of IL-1β and PGE2. Zhou efficiently harnessed their NBS-mediated
cyclization cascade, followed by the Miyaura borylation, to generate the desired key
intermediate 8.58. Subsequently, Suzuki−Miyaura coupling and photocyclization
afforded the desired cyclized product 8.60, which can be readily transformed into
dactyllactone A (8.61).
8.1.1.2 Synthesis Using Ortho Arylation Reactions
Besides ortho alkylation, employing Type A bifunctional reagents for ortho
arylation also offers a rapid pathway to access polyfused aromatic rings. The
carbazomycins, isolated from Streptoverticillium, are antibiotics containing a
carbazole core. In 2008, Catellani presented a direct method for synthesizing the274 8 Application of the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

Nitidine is a bioactive plant benzophenanthridine alkaloid isolated from the
root of Zanthoxylum nitidum. In 2011, Lautens achieved a formal synthesis of
benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids, nitidine, and NK109, capitalizing on Type B
ortho arylation/ipso amination with aryl triflate 8.65 [14]. Pyrrolophenanthridine
alkaloids, like assoanine and pratosine, exhibit various biological properties,
including acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, anticancer activity and antitri￾panosomal activity. In 2014, Takemoto synthesized assoanine (8.72) and pratosine
(8.73) from a common intermediate 8.71, using a similar Type B ortho arylation/ipso
amination reaction [15].
It is fascinating how ortho arylation with Type C bifunctional reagents can lead
to distinct fused ring systems like those found in rhazinilam and rhazinal. These
compounds have captured attention due to their unique bioactivities against various
cancer cell lines and theirintriguing pyrrole skeleton. The tetracyclic framework the
rhazinilam family shares, featuring an axial chiral pyrrole-aniline biaryl fragment8.1 Applications in Synthesis of Natural Products and Drugs 275

complexity. In 2013, Gu and coworkers achieved the total synthesis of (±)-rhazinal
using Type C ortho arylation/ipso Heck reaction, with 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene 8.75
as an effective aryl electrophile [16]. The electron-withdrawing aldehyde functional
group in the pyrrole ring played a crucialrole in the Pd/NBE-catalyzed reaction. The
resulting key intermediate 8.76 was transformed into rhazinal (8.78) in three steps
(Figure 8.13). Later, the same team achieved the enantioselective synthesis with a
chiral ligand, representing the first catalytically asymmetric Catellani-type reaction
[17]. Notably, related alkaloids like (+)-rhazinilam (8.80) and (+)-kopsiyunnanine
C1-3 (8.81) have also been synthesized in a concise and unified manner.
8.1.1.3 Synthesis Using Ortho Amination Reactions
In 2015, Ritter showcased the applicability of the Type A ortho amination/ipso
borylation reaction for the rapid assembly of two important pharmaceuticals: the
antipsychotic drug Abilify and the anti-inflammatory drug Flunixin (Figure 8.14)
[18]. These findings marked the first instance of ipso-C—B bond formation in
ortho-C−H activation reactions. The pivotal arylboronic ester intermediates,
formed through the Pd/NBE catalysis, underwent transformations into diverse
functional groups. Notably, the conversion led to a chloride group in the synthesis of
Abilify and a methyl group in the synthesis of Flunixin, underlining the versatility
of this transformation.
In the previous examples, the majority of Pd/NBE-catalyzed annulations require
the presence of an ortho substituent on the aryl iodide substrate to facilitate the
desired NBE extrusion. In the absence of such ortho substituents, the reaction
is dominated by di-ortho functionalization or the formation of NBE-linked
side-products, yielding poor selectivity and yield. This phenomenon, termed the
“ortho constraint,” stands as a substantial limitation in the Pd/NBE cooperative
catalysis [19]. The tetrahydrobenzo[b]azepine (THBA) ring system has found a
niche within several marketed pharmaceuticals. While it might be presumed that276 8 Application of the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

THBA synthesis could hinge on the Type B ortho amination and ipso Heck reaction,
the problem lies in the lack of ortho substituents in most bioactive THBAs. For
example, Tolvaptan (8.94), an aquaretic drug renowned for its oral activity as a vaso￾pressin receptor 2 antagonist, is employed in treating hyponatremia and autosomal
dominant polycystic kidney disease. In 2021, Dong and Wang discovered a unique
C7-bromo-substituted NBE compound that overcame such “ortho constraint,”
favoring the desired selectivity in this intramolecular reaction [20]. Exploiting an
olefin-tethered electrophilic amine reagent 8.91, an ortho amination followed by a
subsequent 7-exo-trig Heck cyclization, forming the seven-membered heterocycle
8.92 (Figure 8.15). This key intermediate was converted to ketone 8.93 through
oxidative cleavage and deprotection. It is worth noting that the preparation of the
ketone intermediate had previously required a laborious seven-step synthesis.
8.1.1.4 Synthesis Using Ortho Acylation Reactions
Aromatic ketones are commonly found in pharmaceutical compounds. As an
example, ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to alleviate
arthritis-related inflammation and severe toothaches. In 2015, the Dong group
employed a Type A ortho acylation/ipso hydrogenation approach for a streamlined
synthesis of ketoprofen (8.98). This strategy utilized readily accessible aryl iodide
8.95 and a unique bifunctional isopropyl carbonate anhydride 8.96 (Figure 8.16).
The application of such a bifunctional reagent effectively addresses the compatibil￾ity issues between the acyl electrophile and the terminating hydride. This method

Figure 8.17 Synthesis of (±)-pauciflorol F and (±)-acredinone A.
showcases the efficacy of Pd/NBE catalysis for the synthesis of meta-substituted
aryl ketones.
Furthermore, the same research group has employed intramolecular Heck
termination in their work on synthesizing indanone-type natural products. One
such target is pauciflorol F, a polyphenolic natural product derived from resveratrol,
which has garnered interest since its discovery in 2004. The concise synthesis of
pauciflorol F (8.102) was achieved using the Type B ortho acylation/ipso Heck
reaction (Figure 8.17). Acredinone A, on the other hand, was isolated from an
acremonium sp. fungus associated with a marine sponge. This compound holds
significance as the first nonpeptidic natural product known to inhibit voltage-gated
potassium channels. The synthetic approach for acredinone A involves two key
Pd/NBE-catalyzed ortho acylation reactions to construct the penta-substituted
arene fragments. Specifically, the Type B ortho acylation/ipso Heck annulation of
aryl iodide 8.104 yielded indenone 8.106, while the Type A ortho acylation/ipso
borylation of aryl iodide 8.108 produced intermediate 8.110. Subsequent bromi￾nation of indenone 8.106 with NBS resulted in fragment 8.107. Additionally,
intermediate 8.110 was transformed into the more stable Molander salt 8.111.
Ultimately, fragments 8.107 and 8.111 were combined through a Suzuki−Miyaura
reaction, employing a bulky and electron-rich dtbpf ligand. The final step involved
the deprotection of 8.112, leading to the successfulsynthesis of acredinone A (8.113)
in just eight steps in the longest linear sequence.8.1 Applications in Synthesis of Natural Products and Drugs 279
8.1.2 Synthesis Using 2-Alkylation of Indoles
In Section 8.1.1, the initial oxidative addition step with aryl iodide substratesinvolves
Pd(0). In contrast, Bach’s 2-alkylation of indoles commences from Pd(II), which is
converted to Pd(IV) during the catalytic cycle, with no participation of Pd(0) in the
reaction. This method is significant due to the prevalent presence of substituted
indoles in natural products, drugs, and biologically active compounds and has been
successfully employed in various total syntheses of indole alkaloids.
In 2012, Jiao and Bach accomplished the total syntheses of two Aspidosperma
alkaloids, namely (±)-aspidospermidine and (±)-goniomitine (Figure 8.18) [21].
In both instances, the 2-alkylation of indoles occurred early in the synthesis,
demonstrating the practicality of this approach.
The synthesis of (±)-aspidospermidine commenced by subjecting indole 8.114
and alkyl bromide 8.115 to standard conditions for 2-alkylation, setting the
stage for a cyclization/alkylation sequence toward lactam 8.117. After hydrob￾oration/oxidation of the alkene and oxidation of the resulting alcohol using
Dess–Martin periodinane, a reductive amination step and lactam reduction
employing DIBAL-H produced amino alcohol 8.118. This compound could be

rearranged under mildly acidic conditions to yield the key intermediate 8.119.
Subsequently, (±)-aspidospermidine (8.120) was obtained through SN2-type
cyclization and reduction of the concomitantly formed imine.
Similarly, the total synthesis of (±)-goniomitine began with the 2-alkylation
of TBS-protected tryptophol. An improved catalytic condition was identified to
synthesize indole 8.121, accommodating the C3-substitution. Transformations
leading to the primary alcohol 8.122 were reminiscent of the aspidospermidine
synthesis. The final stages of the process included a Mitsunobu reaction yielding
azide 8.123, followed by concurrent lactamization, azide reduction, and aminal
formation, resulting in the successful production of (±)-goniomitine (8.125) in
satisfactory yields.
Jiao and Bach’s 2-alkylation protocol has been then frequently adopted in
the total synthesis of other indole alkaloids. In the pursuit of total synthesis for
(+)-kopsihainanine A, the Mukai group employed indole 2-alkylation strategy,
leading to the formation of allylation product 8.127 (Figure 8.19) [22]. Subsequently,
the tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ether was cleaved, transforming the resulting alcohol
into an iodide,setting the stage for a Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative allylation process.
With the enantiopure allylation product 8.129 in hand, the tetracyclic core structure
was constructed through a Bischler–Napieralski reaction, followed by a stereos￾elective reduction to yield the amine product. After the protection of both of the
nitrogen atoms, the synthesis was followed by a Ru-catalyzed dihydroxylation step,
accompanied by the hydrogenolytic deprotection of the piperidine nitrogen atom.
The application of IBX oxidation to the vicinal diol triggered the final cyclization via
an intermediary aminal, resulting in the formation of the 1,2-dicarbonyl compound
8.132. The ultimate conversion into (+)-kopsihainanine A (8.133) was achieved by
means of a stereoselective ketone reduction and subsequent deprotection.
(−)-Aspidophylline A was isolated from Malayan Kopsia singapurensis and
exhibited potential in reversing drug resistance in KB cells. In 2016, commencing8.1 Applications in Synthesis of Natural Products and Drugs 281

with the silyloxyethyl-substituted indole 8.134, a successful 2-alkylation resulted
in a desired product 8.136 in high yield (Figure 8.20) [23]. This intermediate was
further advanced into allylic alcohol 8.137. To construct the tetracyclic structure of
akuammiline ketone 8.138, an Ir-catalyzed asymmetric cascade sequence involving
indole allylic alkylation and iminium cyclization was employed, ensuring excellent
stereoselectivity. Further oxidative cleavage followed by a Pd-catalyzed methoxy￾carbonylation yielded ester 8.139, which was subsequently transformed to azide
8.140 through azidoalkoxylation. The final stage of the (−)-aspidophylline A (8.141)
synthesis involved a sequence of Staudinger reduction, allylation, and Ni-catalyzed
cyclization.
(+)-Strictamine, an akuammiline-type compound, was initially isolated in
1966 and demonstrated inhibitory effects on NF-kB. In 2017, Qin and coworkers
achieved a formal total synthesis of (+)-strictamine. Starting with the 2-alkylation
of the tryptophan derivative 8.142, the functionalized indole 8.144 was generated
(Figure 8.21) [24]. This intermediate underwent a series of transformations involv￾ing acetal deprotection, bromocyclization, and diazo insertion to the resulting
aldehyde’s C—H bond, resulting in the formation of β-keto ester 8.145. Closure of
the ring was accomplished via a Cu-mediated substitution of the benzylic bromide.
Enol 8.146 underwent radical decarboxylation, triflation/hydrogenolysis, and
Ti-catalyzed reductive ring opening to advance the synthesis. In the final steps,
after allylic bromination and elimination in intermediate 8.147, aza 1,6-conjugate
addition was followed by removing the tosyl-protecting group, allowing for
iodosobenzene-promoted oxidation of the amine to an imine. Another deprotection
and N-alkylation led to the known vinyl iodide 8.149, thus concluding the formal
total synthesis of (+)-strictamine (8.150).282 8 Application of the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis

When employing Bach’s 2-alkylation method intramolecularly, it can lead to
the formation of a macrocycle. (−)-Deoxoapodine, initially isolated from Tabernae
armeniaca and later from Hazunta modesta, features a distinctive tetrahydro￾furan ring fused to the aspidosperma skeleton. In 2020, Tokuyama successfully
constructed this skeleton by creating a nine-membered lactam through an
intramolecular indole 2-alkylation reaction [25]. The synthesis began with an
asymmetric bromocycloetherification using homoallylic alcohol 8.151, employing
a chiral anion strategy in phase-transfer catalysis. A series of steps, including Keck
allylation, ozonolysis, reduction, and deprotection, yielded primary alcohol 8.153.
After removing the Cbz protecting group, the resulting amine was condensed with
indole-3-acetic acid 8.154, which was then converted into iodide 8.156 using the
Appel reaction. The highly strained bridged nine-membered lactam ring 8.156 was
formed via the intramolecular indole 2-alkylation approach, with halide scavengers
like KNTf2 proving vital for achieving high yield. Additionally, a nonheme Fe
catalyst, i.e. Fe(S,S-PDP), along with TBHP as an oxidant, effectively promoted the
oxidative intramolecular Mannich reaction to generate the aspidosperma skeleton.
Lastly, the introduction of a methoxy carbonyl group completed the synthesis of
(−)-deoxoapodine (8.159) (Figure 8.22).
Tryprostatin A, initially isolated as a secondary metabolite from the marine
fungal strain Aspergillus fumigatus BM939, demonstrated a remarkable ability
to inhibit cell cycle progression in the G2/M phase of tsFT210 cells. In 2021,
Shi and coworkers utilized a sequential C–H activation strategy for synthesizing
tryprostatin A (Figure 8.23) [26]. This innovative approach commenced with a
Pd(II)-catalyzed β-methyl C(sp3)–H monoarylation of 8-aminoquinoline derived
alanine 8.160. The quinoline directing group present in intermediate 8.162 can
be transformed into methyl ester 8.163, which was subsequently converted into
N-Boc-6-OMeTrp 8.164 in two steps. The strategic application of Bach’s method8.1 Applications in Synthesis of Natural Products and Drugs 283

8.1.3 Synthesis Using Ortho Functionalization of Vinyl Substrates
All-carbon tetrasubstituted olefins are frequently encountered in natural products,
pharmaceuticals, and organic materials. They can also serve as highly substituted
precursors for epoxides, cyclopropanes, and cyclobutanes. However, the synthesis
of these olefins has posed significant challenges, especially when achieving regio￾and stereocontrolled outcomes. The alkenyl Catellani reaction, previously underex￾plored, faced obstacles due to the high reactivity of the olefin π bond in contrast to
a more stable aryl structure. In 2019, Dong and coworkers reported the first alkenyl
version of the Catellanireaction, leveraging their novel amide-substituted NBE [27].
This alkenyl Catellani reaction has recently been applied in the synthesis of natural
products and pharmaceuticals.284 8 Application of the Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis
Cochlearol B was isolated from Ganoderma cochlear and exhibited potent antifi￾brotic properties. It features a fused polycyclic ring system (4/5/6/6/6) with a central
hepta-substituted cyclobutane core, amenable to formation through the alkenyl
Catellani reaction. In 2021, Schindler began the total synthesis by performing a
Kabbe condensation between compounds 8.167 and 8.168, resulting in the forma￾tion of chromanone 8.169 [28]. This intermediate was subsequently resolved using
(R)-tert-butanesulfinamide with 95% ee. Treatment with Comin’s reagent yielded
triflate 8.171, which underwent a Type B ortho alkylation/ipso Heck reaction under
Dong’s standard conditions to yield diene 8.173 in high yield. Employing visible
light-enabled [2+2] cycloaddition conditions transformed diene 8.174 into the sole
product, pentacyclic cyclobutane 8.174. The terminal alkene in 8.174 underwent
a two-step dihydroxylation and oxidative cleavage sequence, leading to a ketone,
followed by a condensation reaction with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal
(DMF-DMA), generating enaminone 8.175. Tandem triflation and hydrolysis,
coupled with a palladium-catalyzed reduction, furnished 8.176 in high yield. A final
three-step demethylation completed the total synthesis of (+)-cochlearol B (8.177)
(Figure 8.24).
In addition to the tetrasubstituted olefin synthesis, the alkenyl Catellani reaction
also stands out due to its ability to achieve α-amination of alkenyl triflates, leading to
a transposed enamine intermediate. This intermediate can undergo in situ hydroly￾sis, resulting in the formation of the carbonyl 1,2-migrated product. In 2020, Dong
and colleagues demonstrated this carbonyl 1,2-transposition strategy for the formal
synthesis of pallescensin A (8.185), a compound isolated from Disidiera pallescens
sponge. Utilizing geranyl bromide as a starting material, they efficiently prepared the
same ketone intermediate 8.184 in just three steps (Figure 8.25) [29], a significant
reduction from the previous eight-step synthesis.
8.2 Applications in Synthesis of Organic Aromatic
Materials
Poly-substituted arenes are not only prevalent in bioactive compounds but also
frequently encountered in organic polymers. This underscores the potential utility
of the Pd/NBE catalysis for creating aromatic polymers, owing to its unique ability
to concurrently forge multiple bonds in a single step.
The Pd/NBE catalysis often leads to the reductive elimination of ANP, forming
norbornyl benzocyclobutenes as a common side reaction [30]. However, the Xia
group cleverly leveraged this distinctive arene/NBE annulation reaction, applying
it to synthesize a novel category of ladder polymers (Figure 8.26). The challenge
is tuning this side-reaction pathway to be selective and efficient, which is a
requirement for being used in polymerization. Both aryl bromides and triflates
were viable monomers, coupling effectively with norbornadienes. C1 and C4
substitutions in aryl bromides were identified to be essential for optimal annulation
efficiency (Figure 8.26) [31]. The ortho substituent had a favorable impact, while anO

A model study involving 2,5-dimethyl-bromobenzene and norbornadiene yielded
over 98% yield with remarkable exo selectivity, confirming the method’s suitability
for polymer synthesis. Convenient synthesis of bowing-ribbon conformation
polymers (8.187) was achieved using disubstituted p-dibromobenzenes and nor￾bornadiene. Introducing biphenyl monomers introduced bending freedom (8.188)
due to the constrained yet rotatable biphenyl bond. Beyond AA and BB types,
AB-type monomers (8.189) were also applicable. Generating ladder polymers
of substantial molecular weights (10–50 kDa) was feasible, and these exhibited
outstanding thermal stability, high carbonization yields, and significant intrinsic
porosity. Subsequently, the same research group demonstrated the integration of
a spirocyclic motif into the polymer backbone, allowing for the introduction of
diverse functional groups (FGs) into side chains [32, 33].
These hydrocarbon polymers possess glass-transition temperatures surpassing
their thermal decomposition thresholds. While films of these microporous poly￾mers displayed significant permeability, their gas separation selectivity remained
low. However, through manipulation of the backbone arrangement, they iden￾tified a range of such 3D-contorted ladder polymers. These polymers yield
mechanically robust films, combining ultrahigh selectivity and permeability.
The synthesis of these 3D-contorted polymers 8.190 uses 2,7-dibromofluorenes or
2,7-dibromo-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene and norbornadiene as building blocks. This
unique polymer configuration resulted in enhanced selectivity and permeability for
various gas separation processes.
Moreover, the utilization of benzooxanorbornadienes (oNBE) expanded
the scope of creating polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons through the same
annulation-aromatization process, broadening the potential applications of this
methodology. Incorporating four-membered rings into π-systems creates intriguing
antiaromatic cyclobutadienoid (CBD) circuits, though their synthesis has posed
challenges. Employing the Catellani annulation approach between oNBEs and
aryl bromides, followed by aromatization, presents a versatile and cost-effective
strategy for synthesizing a diverse array of conjugated ladder structures containing
antiaromatic CBD circuits. This approach is particularly valuable consideringBr Pd(OAc)2 (0.1 mol%), PPh3

that bromoarenes serve as ubiquitous building blocks for nearly all conjugated
structures. Unexpectedly, Xia and coworkers discovered that Pd-catalyzed oNBE
ring-opening, followed by β-oxygen elimination, competes significantly with the
annulation pathway when utilizing oNBEs instead of NBEs. To mitigate this
side reaction, they introduced two methyl groups to the bridgehead positions of
oNBE 8.191 (Figure 8.27) [34]. Encouragingly, with the optimized conditions,
they achieved high yields of the desired products 8.192, which were subsequently
aromatized through heating under acidic conditions.
They later achieved an efficient synthesis of a novel series of [3]naphthylene
regioisomers, fusing three naphthalenoids via two CBDs in linear (8.194), angular
(8.195), and bent configurations (not shown) [35]. These regioisomers displayed
unique optoelectronic properties. Analyzed by nucleus-independent chemical shift
calculations, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography, the fusion pattern
significantly influenced local antiaromaticity and aromaticity in the fused CBDs
and naphthalenoids. In addition, they also introduced a streamlined approach
to synthesizing dinaphthobenzo[1,2:4,5]dicyclobutadiene 8.196, allowing for
adjustable electronic properties and molecular packing [36]. Manipulating silyl
substituent sizes optimized its “brick-layer” packing, resulting in a charge mobility
of up to 0.52 cm2/V/s in field-effect transistors.
In the aforementioned polymerizations, NBE was employed as the monomer
rather than a cocatalyst. In 2018, Dong and coworker introduced the first
Pd/NBE-catalyzed polymerization, streamlining the synthesis of functional aro￾matic polymers (Figure 8.28) [37]. Leveraging ortho amination/ipso Sonogashira
coupling, they devised an A2B2C-type multicomponent polymerization for prepar￾ing diverse amine-functionalized arylacetylene-containing polymers(8.197). Unlike
conventional “prefunctionalization” or “postfunctionalization” methods, this “in
situ functionalization” approach enabled simultaneous creation of polymer back￾bones and incorporation ofside-chains within a single catalytic cycle. Consequently,
this technique facilitates fast and modular generation of various amine-substituted
polymers using easily accessible monomers. With AA diaryl iodide monomers,
both flexible and rigid linkers were viable. Similarly, the diacetylene BB monomers
accommodated electron-rich and poor linkers during polymerization. By varying
the amine C monomer, they synthesized an array of pendant-functionalized aro￾matic polymers. Notably, a polymer featuring the ferrocene group exhibited redox
responsivenessthrough cyclic voltammetry (8.197a), while a polymer incorporating
a tetraphenylethylene motif demonstrated solid-state photoluminescence (8.197b).
The same research group later disclosed a three-step procedure to synthe￾size highly water-soluble poly(para-phenylene ethynylene)s (PPEs) using the
Pd/NBE-catalyzed AB-C-type polymerization (Figure 8.29) [38]. In this innovative
approach, an AB-type alkyne-substituted aryl iodide monomer was employed,
allowing simultaneous installation of two piperazine meta-side-chains during PPE
backbone construction. Upon removal of the N-Boc protection group, the resulting
polymer exhibited remarkable water solubility due to the potential for doubly
protonating the piperazine side-chains (8.199) under acidic aqueous conditions.Br O Pd(OAc)2, JohnPhos

8.3 Summary
In summary, the rapid advancement of the Pd/NBE catalysis field has led to a
growing array of applications in streamlined syntheses of complex target molecules
and functional materials. This is due to the effectiveness of simultaneous ipso/ortho
difunctionalization to construct poly-substituted arenes. Notably, the shift from
traditional ortho-substituted aryl iodides to free indoles, ortho-unsubstituted aryl
iodides, as well as alkenyl triflates has significantly broadened the scope of Pd/NBE
catalysis. Consequently, this expansion has yielded numerous exciting applications
in total synthesis and organic materials. It can be anticipated that more and moreReferences 291
innovative methods and their applications will emerge in the future, perhaps with
the assistance of novel (chiral) norbornene cocatalysts or novel coupling partners.
