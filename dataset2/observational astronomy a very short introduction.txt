Index 143Preface
This book represents a completely revised edition of what was 
originally published as Telescopes: A Very Short Introduction, 
reframed to reflect the wider field of the whole observational side 
of modern astronomy and astrophysics, given that we no longer 
rely on traditional optical telescopes alone. Since Telescopes was 
published in 2016, observations are being pushed even further to 
the limits of what is possible. With the first ever observation of the 
shadow of a black hole, for example, a telescope the size of the 
Earth was used to see an object the size of an apple on the surface 
of the Moon. The development of detectors sensitive to the cosmic 
messages carried by neutrinos and gravitational waves now enable 
us to observe regions of the Universe that hitherto have been 
hidden from traditional telescopes. We have observed the violent 
collisions and mergers of neutron stars and black holes in galaxies 
billions of light years away via the information carried by 
gravitational waves. The rate of progress in this fast-moving field 
is extraordinary, and has shown no signs of letting up as a new 
generation of more powerful telescopes comes online. How is it 
that we modern humans, mere specks in an unimaginably vast 
cosmos, and who have only been around for about 200,000 years, 
have devised ways of seeing galaxies so remote in space and in 
time that they emitted their light over 13 billion years ago, when 
the infant Universe was only a few million years old?List of illustrations

Chapter 1
The observable Universe
In a galaxy more than a billion light years away, two black holes, 
one 36, and the other 29 times the mass of the Sun, had become 
ensnared in each other’s powerful gravitational grip, and were 
gyrating rapidly around each other. As the pair orbited, the 
spacetime around them was dynamic and distorted, producing 
disturbances spreading out at the speed of light across the 
Universe, as ripples in the fabric of spacetime—gravitational 
waves. As this drama played out, the black holes spiralled inwards 
towards their fate—the merger of two black holes into a single, 
bigger one. A billion years later, in 2015, the final ripples from this 
merger, GW150914, reached the Earth and jiggled the sensors of a 
new and exquisitely sensitive type of astronomical instrument, the 
Laser Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). This was the first 
ever detection of a gravitational wave.
Modern observational astronomy is exciting and varied, and is 
capturing dramatic events in the cosmos which may well not 
involve traditional telescopes. Until just a few decades ago, 
astronomers had only photons to work with and virtually 
everything we know about the Universe has come from studying 
particles of light. Before 1945, this meant observing in the narrow 
visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Since then, great 
advances in technology have enabled us to probe beyond the 
visible spectrum, allowing us to explore the Universe at radio, Observational Astronomy
2
infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma ray wavelengths. These 
new observations, made with increasingly sophisticated 
technology, have shown us a plethora of exotic phenomena such as 
young galaxies at the edge of the visible Universe, pulsars, quasars, 
colliding galaxies, and exploding stars. Pulsars, or pulsating stars, 
are neutron stars, the relatively tiny stellar cores left behind when 
massive stars explode as supernovae, spinning rapidly and 
emitting intense beams of radiation. Quasars, or quasi-stellar 
radio sources, first observed at radio wavelengths, are extremely 
distant objects which emit vast amounts of energy and powered by 
matter falling into supermassive black holes. These exotic objects 
have been discovered using new types of telescopes that have 
enabled us to see farther, deeper in time, and to ‘see’ in 
different ways.
Observational astronomy is not just a story of technological 
development. To interpret what is observed, astronomers and 
astrophysicists use theory. Observations and physical theory have 
together enabled us to piece together how stars produce their 
energy, the origin of the chemical elements, how black holes form, 
and how supermassive black holes lurking in the hearts of galaxies 
can power quasars, spewing out immensely powerful jets of 
particles and energy thousands of light years into space. 
Observations have shown us that the Universe is expanding and 
that the expansion itself is accelerating. Sometimes we discover 
celestial objects that provoke us into devising ingenious ways of 
testing theories, and sometimes an observation is so puzzling or 
surprising that we are driven to revise, expand, or even replace our 
model of what is happening, how, and why. Either way, theory and 
observation are inseparably entwined, as will be evident 
throughout this volume.
The first maps of the stars were made in antiquity by the 
Babylonians and Egyptians who, 5,000 years ago, were skilled 
astronomers. The father of observational astronomy is a Greek, 
Hipparchus, who, in around 129 bc, catalogued 850 stars and The observable Universe
3
invented a way to record their apparent brightness, the magnitude 
system, still in use today. Magnitudes range from one (the 
brightest) to six (the faintest visible with the naked eye), a 
back-to-front scale where a difference of five magnitudes indicates 
that one star is 100 times brighter than another.
The use of the first telescopes greatly increased our awareness of 
how big the visible Universe truly is. Galileo Galilei took a 3x 
power Dutch spyglass, multiplied the magnification 10-fold and, 
with it, separated the diffuse glow of our galaxy, the Milky Way, 
into a vast number of points of light from separate stars. As 
telescopes increased in size they revealed fainter objects, pushing 
observations ever deeper towards the boundaries of the visible 
Universe. Today’s biggest telescopes capture 10 million times more 
photons than the eye, and shepherd them onto electronic retinas 
which are much more sensitive than those in our eyes.
Light brings us most of the knowledge we discover about the 
world. Nothing travels faster than light, with a speed, c, of 
300,000 kilometres (km) per second. By everyday standards this 
speed is enormous, so that light appears to move instantaneously. 
However, the light reaching you from the words you are reading 
takes a nanosecond, one-billionth of a second, to reach your eyes. 
And the light from our nearest star, the Sun, takes eight minutes 
to reach us—we see the Sun not as it is now, but as it was eight 
minutes ago. The finite speed of light means that we never see the 
present, we always see the past. Time and space are inextricably 
intertwined. Astronomers have turned this into a way of 
measuring big distances in the Universe. The speed of light 
defines the astronomical distance of a light year, the distance light 
travels in one year. (One light year is almost 10 trillion km (or 
10,000,000,000,000 km).) Moving out deeper in space, the 
nearest star to the Sun is Proxima Centauri. The light it emits 
takes four years to reach us; it is four light years away. The faint 
stars that Galileo saw in the Milky Way are further away still: they 
emitted the light that we are now seeing 10,000 years ago.Observational Astronomy
4
But the light that we start with is that from our star, the Sun. 
The Sun is a small, rather commonplace star. Its most obvious 
observational feature is its brightness, quantified by the solar 
constant, the life-maintaining flux of energy arriving at the Earth, 
measured as 1.37 kilowatt (kW) per square metre (m). Integrating 
this flux over the incident surface of the Earth, and allowing for 
the radiation reflected back into space, the amount of energy 
absorbed by the Earth is enormous and greatly exceeds all 
human-made power sources. The total power emitted by the Sun 
(the standard astronomical unit of luminosity) is 3.86 × 1026 watts, 
its mass (the unit of 1 solar mass) is 1.99 × 1030 kilogrammes (kg), 
and it is a nearly perfect sphere with a diameter of 1.39 
million km.
The Sun is the most studied of all stars. It is the only star close 
enough to reveal surface features such as sunspots, granular 
surface texture, solar flares, prominences, and a hot outer 
atmosphere, the corona. Other stars present such small angular 
sizes to us that making images of the surfaces of even the nearest 
ones requires specialized high-resolution techniques. The light 
emitted by stars comes from the photosphere and is radiated as a 
broad thermal continuous spectrum. The surface temperatures of 
stars range from 3,000 kelvin (K) to 30,000K; for the Sun, it is 
5,800K. (The absolute temperature scale used here is measured in 
kelvin starting from absolute zero, 0K, or −273 degrees Celsius 
(°C).) An obvious feature of the stars is that they present different 
colours. A star’s colour relates to its temperature: hot stars radiate 
strongly at short wavelengths (peaking at the blue end of the 
spectrum), and cooler stars radiate at the red end. The Sun’s 
spectrum peaks near the middle, in the green part. The Sun is 
composed of 73 per cent hydrogen and 25 per cent helium, with 
the remainder comprising carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and 
traces of heavier elements. (It is usual for astronomers to refer to 
chemical elements heavier than helium as ‘metals’.) The 
abundances of the elements in the Sun and the gas giant planets 
are similar to those in the Universe as a whole.The observable Universe
5
Extensive solar observations have led to the development of what 
is generally known as the standard stellar model, a mathematical 
model that not only describes the main observational features of 
the Sun, but can also be applied to understanding other stars. The 
model includes the mechanism describing the release of energy in 
the Sun’s hot core by thermonuclear fusion reactions, the 
transport of the energy to the surface by radiation and convection, 
and the evolution of the star. In the core of the Sun, the 
temperature is 15 million K, and the weight of the overlying layers 
press down on it squeezing the particles to densities of over 
10 times that of lead. There, hydrogen nuclei (protons) collide at 
very high speeds. By overcoming the natural electrostatic repulsion 
that exists between positive nuclear charges, conditions exist that 
enable four hydrogen nuclei (protons) to fuse together to make 
helium. This process releases the nuclear binding energy that 
powers the Sun and all stars.
One of the most powerful tools available to observational 
astronomers is spectroscopy—the study of the emission and 
absorption of electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths 
and its interaction with matter. Isaac Newton famously used a 
simple triangular glass prism to split sunlight into its constituent 
colours and demonstrated that what we have come to call ‘white 
light’ is really a mixture of light of all the colours of the rainbow. 
The true power of spectroscopy only began to be realized when 
19th-century astronomers turned spectroscopes towards the stars. 
(A spectroscope is a prism combined with a small telescope 
designed to study a spectrum in detail.) In the Sun, hundreds of 
mysterious narrow dark lines (known as Fraunhofer lines) were 
seen superimposed on the underlying broad thermal spectrum. 
It was as if numerous narrow ‘slices’ had been removed from the 
spectrum. These dark lines are caused by the absorption of light at 
specific wavelengths, relating to the quantum energy transitions of 
atoms in the Sun’s cooler atmosphere. The different patterns of 
atomic lines in a spectrum are like fingerprints revealing the 
presence of different chemical elements; the patterns identify a Observational Astronomy
6
given type of atom as unambiguously as a supermarket barcode 
identifies its product. Spectroscopic observations therefore 
provided the first profoundly important evidence that the matter 
in the stars is the same type as matter found on Earth. 
Spectroscopic observations are now being made over the entire 
electromagnetic spectrum, and they play a central role in 
providing us with information about the physical state and motion 
of matter in distant celestial objects.
The Sun sits about halfway out from the centre of our galaxy, the 
Milky Way, a giant disc-like spiral galaxy, and home to 200 billion 
stars. Surrounding the nucleus is a central stellar bulge, embedded 
in a flat disc of stars and gas. If we could move out the galactic 
disc and look back at it, it would resemble the spiral galaxy 
Messier 74 (M74), shown in Figure 1. (The M74 galaxy was listed 
by the 18th-century French astronomer Charles Messier, a comet 
seeker. At that time comet hunting was a major activity and M74 
was put on a watch-list of around 100 non-cometary but fuzzy 
objects to be avoided.) In between the stars, spiral galaxies contain 
a tenuous interstellar medium of gas and dust grains in the disc. 
From our place in the galaxy we see the Milky Way as a diffuse 
band of light, with dark blotches of dust clouds obscuring the light

from countless distant stars. The Sun orbits around the centre of 
the galaxy at a speed of 230km per second, and makes one 
complete revolution, a galactic ‘year’, in 226 million Earth years.
Stars are the building blocks of galaxies, and galaxies gather into 
larger structures. The image of M74 gives the impression that the 
stars in a galaxy are densely concentrated, especially in the central 
bulge. But the average spacing of stars in spirals is about five light 
years (30 million solar diameters). This means that the chance of 
stars physically colliding with each other is negligible. Hence the 
stars in a galaxy are, in effect, collisionless. The other main class of 
galaxies are ellipticals, which are shaped like larger versions of the 
central bulges of spirals but contain little gas or dust. When we 
look out into space, beyond the Milky Way, we see groups and 
other assemblies of galaxies in the local Universe. When 
astronomers talk about the ‘local Universe’ they mean everything 
in our immediate vicinity for which the effects of cosmic evolution 
can be ignored. In practical terms this is a spherical volume 
roughly a billion light years across. Since the average separation of 
galaxies is around 10 million light years, the local Universe 
contains some 60 million galaxies. But when we look out further 
than this, we discover plenty of evidence that the Universe has 
undergone dramatic evolution in its history, evidence that points 
to its origin in the Big Bang.
The age of the Universe, namely the time that has elapsed since 
the Big Bang, is 13.8 billion years. It is reasonable to ask how big 
the observable Universe is. The oldest photons that we can 
observe are those of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) 
radiation, the relic of an early hot and dense phase, emitted at a 
time before the stars and galaxies had formed. When it was 
emitted, the CMB radiation would have appeared to our eyes as 
visible light, but, owing to the expansion of the Universe, it has 
now been shifted in wavelength (or redshifted) by such a large 
factor that we now observe it in the microwave waveband. The 
CMB radiation has been travelling through space for nearly Observational Astronomy
8
13.8 billion years. We might expect that if it has been travelling for 
that length of time, and is only just now entering our telescopes, 
the visible Universe should be a sphere, centred on the Earth, with 
a radius of 13.8 billion light years. Correct? No, this is 
completely wrong.
Where this line of reasoning goes wrong is in the assumption that 
the Universe is static, namely that the distances between objects 
are constant. The Universe is not static. Observations have shown 
us that it was once smaller and hotter, and is expanding. When we 
measure the distance between two points on Earth, we take it for 
granted that we can make measurements simultaneously. But that 
is not the case: we are only just now seeing the CMB radiation 
that was emitted shortly after the Big Bang, nearly 13.8 billion 
years later. In the time it has taken for the radiation to reach us, 
space has expanded, and the place where the original light was 
emitted is now further away from us. The simplest calculation of 
the radius of the sphere around us from which the CMB was 
emitted suggests 41 billion light years. But even that is too small. 
In 1998 astronomers discovered an extra component of the 
Universe, dark energy, a repulsive anti-gravity energy field, filling 
all of space and pushing the galaxies apart. When dark energy is 
taken into consideration, the radius of the sphere from which the 
CMB light was emitted increases to 46 billion light years. So, in 
short: when we observe the CMB radiation with our telescopes, 
we are seeing it as it was when it was emitted a (relatively) short 
distance away; but now, because of the expansion of space, the 
location from which it was emitted has moved 1,000 times further 
away from us than it used to be. When we see this radiation, we 
see it as it was then, but not as it is now.
We therefore find ourselves sitting in the middle of a 46-billion￾light-year-radius sphere containing all the observable matter in 
the Universe. There may, of course, be more matter outside the 
sphere, but its light has not had time to reach us yet, and so it is 
unobservable. The sphere of the observable Universe contains The observable Universe
9
several hundred billion galaxies, equivalent to a matter content of 
some 1080 hydrogen atoms. Although it is difficult to imagine such 
a vast number, the Universe is so big that the average density of 
matter, spread out through the whole volume, amounts to only a 
few hydrogen atoms per cubic metre. By comparison, the Earth’s 
density is almost 1030 times larger than that. Planets are therefore 
unusually dense regions of the Universe. But there are objects 
even denser than planets. The density of a neutron star is over 1013
times greater than that in a planet. These numbers begin to make 
sense when it is appreciated that the Universe is enormous, and 
consists of mostly empty space. But even then, space is not really 
truly empty: it contains dark energy, dark matter, the CMB 
radiation, subatomic neutrino particles, and highly energetic 
cosmic ray particles. The fabric of spacetime is also crossed by the 
expanding ripples of gravitational waves, emitted by the violent 
mergers of black holes and neutron stars.10
Chapter 2
Big telescopes
Before 1945, most astronomical observations were made at optical 
wavelengths. By studying the visible light from the stars, nebulae, 
and galaxies, astronomers have amassed a vast amount of 
knowledge about the Universe. This chapter looks at how today’s 
big optical telescopes have come to collect a million times more 
light than Galileo’s instrument, how the information they yield on 
the structure of the Universe is being decoded, and how these 
powerful instruments are being used to reveal some of the most 
violent, distant, and ancient objects in the cosmos.
Telescopes
A telescope is effectively a light bucket, designed to gather 
photons and shepherd them accurately into light sensors, 
photographic plates, or the eyes of astronomers. One of the key 
attributes of a telescope is size, measured by the aperture or 
diameter of the main objective lens or mirror. A maxim with 
telescopes is: bigger is better. There are two reasons for this. First, 
large-aperture telescopes capture more light and so enable the 
faintest objects to be observed. Some of the most interesting 
photons come from the most distant objects in the Universe and 
so are sparse. A telescope focuses light onto the picture elements 
(pixels) of an electronic sensor to form an image or a spectrum. 
In general, the images of low-brightness objects are ultimately Big telescopes
11
degraded by noise which can limit the scientific information being 
sought. There are two main noise sources: statistical noise 
resulting from the low numbers of photons detected, and thermal 
noise produced in electronic light sensors. The first of these can be 
reduced by capturing more photons, either by increasing the 
telescope aperture or the length of the exposure, or both. The 
second is minimized by cooling the detectors. The net effect is to 
increase a crucially important quantity, the signal-to-noise ratio.
The second reason that bigger telescopes are better is that they 
form sharper and more detailed images, namely they have higher 
angular resolution. The amount of image detail a telescope can 
resolve is governed by a fundamental wave property, diffraction, 
the tendency for light to bend around obstacles such as holes, 
sharp edges, or slits. Diffraction is commonly seen when ocean 
waves spread out behind a breakwater at the entrance to a 
harbour. Waves of any type are characterized by a wavelength (the 
distance between successive wave crests), a frequency (the number 
of oscillations that occurs each second measured in Hertz, or Hz), 
an amplitude (the height of the wave), and the phase of a wave (a 
specific location or timing of a point in a wave cycle). The related 
concept of wavefronts was first described by the 17th-century 
Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens. Huygens imagined that every 
point on a luminous body was the source of elementary spherical 
wavelets which spread out at the speed of light. A wavefront is the 
surface which is tangent to all the wavelets. As a wavefront moves 
forward, it will itself becomes a new source of wavelets, thus 
describing light propagation. By throwing a pebble into a still 
pond, the ripples (wavefronts) spread out as concentric circles 
from the point of impact and, seen from a large distance away, 
approximate to parallel plane waves. The crests of the waves 
define the wavefronts which lie perpendicular to the wave 
direction. This is how we observe starlight; the stars are so distant 
that the light they emit arrives at the Earth as plane wavefronts. 
The smallest possible angle a telescope can resolve is called the 
diffraction limit, and is expressed in wave optics by the ratio of Observational Astronomy
12
the wavelength of the light to the diameter of the aperture. The 
larger the aperture (and/or the smaller the wavelength) the higher 
the resolving power of the telescope.
The first telescopes were refractors, which collect and focus the 
light with lenses (Figure 2(a)). Refraction is the bending of light 
when it passes obliquely through a transparent medium such as 
glass or water, and is caused by the light slowing down while it is 
traversing the medium. A lens has the special property that when 
a ray strikes its curved surface, the ray is bent, and exits the lens in 
a new direction. The lens gathers parallel light rays from a distant 
lens

aberration to produce images on the curved image plane at p.Big telescopes
13
point-like object such as a star and focuses them to a bright spot 
on the focal plane, at a distance of one focal length away from the 
lens. A lens (or a curved mirror) can be thought of simply as a 
device that converts incoming plane wavefronts of light to 
spherical wavefronts, converging on a focal spot. The wavefronts 
arriving from the different parts of an extended object, such as the 
Moon, are each slightly tilted so that the light is focused on 
different regions of the focal plane where an (inverted) image 
is formed.
To convert a convex lens into a telescope that can be used visually, 
a second lens or eyepiece is needed, and this acts as a magnifying 
glass. The eyepiece converts the steeply angled rays at the focus 
into a near-parallel bundle of rays on which the eye can focus. 
Galileo’s telescope of 1610 used a concave eyepiece lens placed 
before the main focus, and German astronomer Johannes Kepler’s 
telescope used a convex lens placed after it. Simple refractors, 
however, suffer from a number of optical distortions such as 
spherical and chromatic aberration. By the 19th century, technical 
improvements largely overcame these defects, when the refractor 
reached its heyday as the professional telescope of choice. The 
largest refractor, the 1m refractor at the Yerkes Observatory in 
Williams Bay, Wisconsin, was built in 1897 by a visionary 
American astronomer, George Ellery Hale. The Yerkes telescope, 
however, marked the high point for refractors. The objective lens 
alone weighed half a tonne. Since a lens can only be supported 
around its edge, the glass of any larger lens would sag 
unacceptably, ruining the image quality.
The problematic defect of chromatic aberration which plagued 
early refractors was noted by many astronomers, including 
Newton. The edge of a lens resembles the triangular section of a 
prism, and behaves similarly—splitting light up into the different 
colours of the spectrum. Each colour has its own different focus 
which makes it impossible to form a single sharp white light 
image. With this in mind, Newton designed and built the first Observational Astronomy
14
practical reflecting telescope in 1668 (Figure 2(c)) in which light is 
reflected from a concave mirror (essentially a lens turned inside 
out), allowing the image to be viewed with an eyepiece, and 
eliminating chromatic aberration. The extra flat mirror in the 
optical tube of the Newtonian telescope allows an observer to view 
the image from the side. The advantages of reflectors over 
refractors include being able to make mirrors with both large 
apertures and short focal lengths, thus effectively reducing the 
length and weight of telescopes. Until the end of the 19th century, 
however, the only material available for mirrors was a bronze alloy 
called speculum. Speculum is a brittle material which is difficult 
to cast, grind, polish, and keep from tarnishing. These drawbacks 
did not prevent several important reflectors being made, including 
those by William Herschel for his discovery of the planet Uranus 
(another was his largest reflector of 1789 with a 1.2m aperture) 
and Lord Rosse who in 1845 built the so-called ‘Leviathan of 
Parsonstown’ in Ireland. His was a giant 1.83m telescope which he 
used to make the first ever observation of the spiral structure in a 
galaxy—the ‘Whirlpool’ galaxy (M51). The key technical 
breakthrough for reflecting telescopes came in 1859 when Karl 
August von Steinhal and Léon Foucault discovered how to deposit 
silver on glass, and so opened the way to making large-diameter 
mirrors which could be ground, polished, and coated with silver.
The distances to the stars
Measuring distances is one of the oldest problems in astronomy. 
The simplest and most direct technique, trigonometric parallax, 
was well known to the ancients and is based on the surveyor’s 
method of triangulation. The angular bearing of a distant object is 
measured from each end of a baseline, making a triangle with the 
object at the apex. This is easily seen by holding up a finger at 
arm’s length, looking at it with first one eye closed and then the 
other. The finger appears to shift with respect to the background, 
making an angle between the two sightlines. Parallax gave the 
astronomers a good estimate of the distance of the Moon, now Big telescopes
15
known to be a little over 380,000 km, and was also used to 
estimate the distance of the Sun, albeit with a little more difficulty 
owing to its greater distance. The Earth–Sun distance is about 
150 million km, which defines the astronomical distance unit, or 
AU. However, because of the much greater distances to even the 
nearest stars, very long baselines are needed to measure stellar 
parallaxes. Once the Earth–Sun distance was known, it was 
possible to use the motion of the Earth around the Sun to observe 
stars at half-yearly intervals, when the Earth is on opposite sides 
of its orbit. The baseline is therefore 2AU. However, even the stars 
nearest to the solar system are so distant (the closest to us is four 
light years away) that their parallax angles are extremely small 
(less than an arcsecond) and hence difficult to measure. 
Measurements of the distances to the nearest stars were not made 
until 1838, with the high-precision telescopic measurements of 
German astronomer Wilhelm Friedrich Bessel.
Finding our place in the galaxy
From our place in the Milky Way, we can only see a small fraction 
of its 200 billion stars. We sit in what is effectively a fog bank—the 
view along the plane of the galaxy is obscured by interstellar dust, 
but when we look out and away from the plane of the disc we can 
see much further out to the distant Universe. In the middle of a 
fog bank it is tempting to believe that you are at the centre of 
things, which is what astronomers once thought about our place 
in the galaxy. However, orbiting above and below the plane of the 
Milky Way are hundreds of ancient globular star clusters. These 
are tightly bound spherical star systems, only a few light years 
across and densely packed with hundreds of thousands of stars. 
The globular clusters gather in the halo of the galaxy like bees 
swarming around a hive. In 1916 American astronomer Harlow 
Shapley observed the spatial distribution of the clusters to find out 
if this could indicate where the centre of the galaxy is. To make 
these observations, he used the world’s biggest reflecting 
telescope, the 60-inch (1.5m) telescope sited at the Mount Wilson Observational Astronomy
16
Observatory near Los Angeles, California, and built by George 
Hale. The mirror is a paraboloid, the figure of rotation of a 
parabola, and the mathematical surface that reflects rays arriving 
parallel to the axis of the mirror (paraxial rays) to a sharp focus. 
Shapley saw that the globular clusters were concentrated towards 
the Sagittarius constellation and, from their three-dimensional 
(3D) distribution in space, inferred the Sun to be just over half 
way out (26,000 light years) from the centre of the Milky Way. 
For this, Shapley needed to measure the distances of the clusters. 
They are too far away for stellar parallax measurements, but a new 
method of measuring astronomical distances had just been 
discovered, one that depends on measuring the brightness of a 
special type of star whose light output varies.
The apparent brightness of a star, as measured on Earth, is very 
different from its luminosity, which is an intrinsic quantity defined 
as the total power emitted from its surface. The rate at which the 
emitted energy crosses a unit area on an imaginary sphere 
surrounding a star falls off as the square of the radius of the 
sphere. At twice the distance from the star there are four times as 
many unit areas over which the energy flux is spread, and hence 
the energy flux there is only a quarter as big. This is the inverse 
square law which tells us how a star’s brightness drops off with 
distance. At one time it was thought, mistakenly, that stars all 
have the same intrinsic luminosities and so it might be possible 
to estimate a star’s distance simply by measuring its apparent 
brightness and applying the inverse square law. In fact, the 
luminosities of stars vary by an enormous factor of over 10 million, 
from the least luminous red dwarfs to the most luminous 
supergiant types, such as Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion.
In 1912, Henrietta Swan Leavitt was working in the Harvard 
College Observatory in Boston, USA, one of a team of human 
female ‘computers’, measuring photographic plates of variable 
stars in the Milky Way’s smaller companion galaxies, the two 
Magellanic Clouds. Some stars were a pulsing type called CepheidBig telescopes
17
variables. The Cepheids in Leavitt’s sample are all approximately 
at the same distance, enabling her to deduce that the brighter 
Cepheids have systematically longer pulsation periods, namely 
they obey a period-luminosity relationship. The Danish 
astronomer Ejnar Hertzprung soon found some nearby Cepheids 
which also had parallax distances and so was able to determine 
their luminosities and calibrate the distance scale. Measuring the 
pulsation period and the apparent brightness of a Cepheid 
variable gives its distance. This key observation extended the 
cosmic distance ladder out to much greater distances than the 
100 light years or so that was possible by using parallax alone. What 
the astronomers had found was a standard candle, an object which, 
by comparing its intrinsic luminosity with its observed brightness, 
enables its distance (the luminosity distance) to be inferred.
At that time astronomers were debating the nature of the different 
types of fuzzy objects that were lumped generically together as 
‘nebulae’. We now know that planetary nebulae are glowing clouds 
of gas flung out into space by dying giant stars; reflection nebulae 
shine by starlight reflected by interstellar dust; emission nebulae 
are interstellar gas clouds whose atoms are excited and ionized by 
the ultraviolet light from nearby hot young stars; dark nebulae are 
dust clouds seen silhouetted against brighter regions; and there 
are also the remnants of exploding stars, or supernovae. Finally, 
there are spiral nebulae. With a telescope, some nebulae, for 
example the Orion Nebula (M42) in the Milky Way, have the 
appearance of a smooth, luminous, dusty cloud, peppered with 
brilliant young stars. Others, such as the great spiral in 
Andromeda (M31), have a smooth appearance which had at that 
time not been resolved into stars. Opinions on the nature of the 
spirals were sharply divided between two astronomers: Shapley, 
who believed that they are objects inside our own galaxy, and 
Heber Curtis, who believed them to be extragalactic star systems, 
or ‘island Universes’. The two astronomers put forward their 
arguments in the so-called great debate of 1920. But with no data 
there was no resolution.Observational Astronomy
18
New data did in fact come just three years later from Hale’s 
second large reflector, the 100-inch (2.5m) Hooker Telescope. 
This telescope would be the world’s largest for three decades and 
was used to make two of the greatest discoveries in the history of 
astronomy. The first task was to see if any stars could be discerned 
in the Andromeda spiral nebula, an opportunity that was seized 
upon by American astronomer Edwin Hubble. The telescope did 
indeed reveal a powdering of extremely faint stars. While this 
observation suggested that Andromeda was an island Universe, it 
was not definitive. The crucial step came with Hubble’s 
identification of a Cepheid variable star in Andromeda which 
enabled him to estimate its distance, showing conclusively that it 
is an external galaxy lying well outside our own Milky Way, at a 
distance that we now know to be around two million light years. 
Suddenly the observable Universe had got much bigger.
The expanding Universe
The second discovery made using the Hooker Telescope, that of 
the expanding Universe, is of the greatest importance to 
cosmology and came soon after the discovery of external galaxies. 
It involved the use of spectroscopy to measure the recession 
velocities of galaxies by observing the shift in the wavelengths of 
the atomic spectral lines they emit. The Austrian physicist 
Christian Doppler had shown in 1842 that the wavelength of any 
wave seen by an observer is affected by the velocity of the source of 
the waves, known as the Doppler effect. We are familiar with the 
Doppler effect which is responsible for the high-to-low change in 
pitch of an ambulance siren as it zooms past us. When an 
ambulance is approaching, the peak of each sound wave is emitted 
from a position closer to the observer than the previous one, and 
so takes less time to arrive. The motion bunches the wave peaks 
closer together, which increases the pitch. As the ambulance 
speeds away, the peaks are stretched out, and the pitch drops. In 
1868, the British astronomer William Huggins had been the first 
to put this into practice and measure the radial velocity of a star, Big telescopes
19
Sirius, by comparing the wavelength shift in its spectral lines with 
laboratory measurements. The light from a star that is receding 
from us at a velocity v (much less than the speed of light, c) shows 
spectral lines that are shifted towards the long-wavelength red 
end of the spectrum, by an amount given by the redshift, z = v/c.
If the star is approaching, the light is blueshifted towards the blue 
end of the spectrum.
By 1917, the American astronomer Vesto Slipher had extended this 
technique to measure the radial velocities of entire galaxies whose 
spectrum consists of the merged light of billions of stars. Such 
measurements are challenging because galaxies are low￾brightness objects. Moreover, when the diffuse galactic light is 
dispersed and recorded by a spectrograph (a camera combined 
with a spectrometer) the amount of signal in each wavelength 
interval is further diluted. To achieve a sufficiently high signal-to￾noise ratio for these measurements, Slipher used a large-aperture 
telescope and long-exposure photographs of the spectra. This 
showed that distant galaxies are mostly redshifted, namely that 
most of them are receding from us. Edwin Hubble and Milton 
Humason later used the Hooker Telescope to observe a sample of 
nearby galaxies for which they had both redshift and distance 
information. This showed that the galaxy redshifts increase 
systematically with distance. Wherever you look out into the 
Universe, galaxies appear to be receding away from us with 
speeds, v, proportional to their distances, D. This relationship 
indicates an expanding Universe described by the Hubble law, 
v = H0 D. The constant of proportionality is the Hubble constant, 
H0, which is a measure of local rate of expansion. (The law is now 
called the Hubble–Lemaître law, acknowledging the theoretical 
predictions of an expanding Universe by the Belgian priest and 
cosmologist Georges Lemaître.) At first sight, the Hubble law 
suggests that we occupy a privileged position in the Universe. But 
it turns out that an observer on any other galaxy would observe 
the same phenomenon. When the discovery was announced in 
1929, it hit the astronomical community like a bombshell. At one Observational Astronomy
20
stroke, it overturned the notion of a static Universe, and implied 
that the Universe is evolving, and that it had a definite beginning. 
Think of a movie showing the galaxies flying apart from each 
other, and then run the movie backwards in time. At a certain 
time in the past all the galaxies merge together in a state of 
infinite density in the Big Bang at the beginning of the Universe.
George Hale’s last big telescope, the giant 200-inch Hale 
Telescope, sits in a magnificent white dome the size of the 
Pantheon in Rome at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego 
county where it saw first light in 1948. The telescope’s enormous 
5.1m mirror proved to be challenging to fabricate. The 13-tonne, 
low-expansion Pyrex glass blank took 11 years to grind and polish, 
and was figured as a paraboloid to within 1,000th of the width of 
a human hair. The heavy monolithic mirror relies partly on its 
own stiffness, and partly on the back support of a massive steel 
cell to maintain its shape under gravity when tilted over a wide 
range of angles. At the telescope’s prime focus sits an instrument 
cage which has carried observers moving with the telescope as it 
tracks the sky. There is a hole in the primary mirror for a 
Cassegrain focus (Figure 2(d)) produced using a hyperboloidal 
secondary mirror. The Hale Telescope was the world’s largest 
reflector for 45 years. It has played a crucial role in elucidating 
important astrophysical phenomena and it has been used to 
measure the Hubble constant more precisely than before; to study 
the isotropy and linearity of the expansion of the Universe; and to 
contribute data for the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis, the 
building of the chemical elements by fusion reactions. The 
telescope has also identified the different stellar populations in 
galaxies, which has greatly advanced our understanding of galaxy 
evolution. Although it is no longer the world’s largest telescope 
(that honour passed to the two Keck telescopes in 1992), the Hale 
has now been equipped with an adaptive optics system to increase 
the angular resolution and a high-resolution spectrometer, and is 
now being used to probe the atmospheres of exoplanets.Big telescopes
21
New big telescopes
The apertures of the biggest optical telescopes have doubled every 
40 years. To maintain that rate of progress, new concepts and 
technologies have had to be incorporated into the latest 
generation of 8–10m telescopes. Innovations have been made in 
the development of telescope mounts, new ways of making big 
mirrors and efficient light sensors, and sophisticated techniques of 
removing the blurring of telescope images caused by turbulence in 
the Earth’s atmosphere.
In the simplest type of transit telescope mount (Figure 3(a)), a 
telescope is pivoted about a horizontal east–west axis, tilting the 
telescope up at different altitude angles above the horizon along 
the great circle line of the meridian, the line joining the celestial 
poles and passing through the observer’s zenith. Observations are 
made of strips of sky drifting through the field of view with the 
Earth’s rotation, and the positions of objects are recorded by 
noting their crossing times and altitude angles.
With the 19th-century invention of photography and its almost 
immediate use in astronomy, celestial objects could for the first 
time be recorded using long exposures. To avoid image blurring, it 
soon became essential for telescopes to track objects accurately 
across the sky. The traditional altitude-azimuth (alt-az) mount 
(Figure 3(b)) has the same geometry as a gun turret, and can 
point a telescope to anywhere in the sky. As in the transit mount, 
the telescope pivots in elevation but is also mounted on a rotatable 
horizontal platform allowing it to be pointed to any azimuth angle 
(or compass bearing) and so to anywhere in the sky. To track a sky 
target requires simultaneous rotations about the altitude and 
azimuth axes, as well as a rotation of the imaging sensor, all with 
different rates. Before computer control, it was mechanically 
impossible to perform this complex set of rotations to the required 
precision, and a different system was developed—the equatorial Observational Astronomy
22
mount (Figure 3(c)). If the base of an alt-az mount is tilted up so 
as to align the azimuth axis with the celestial pole, stars can be 
tracked by steadily rotating the telescope about just one axis (the 
polar axis). This simplification was achieved at the expense of 
mechanical complexity which, for large observatory telescopes, 
was significant. All of Hale’s telescopes were mounted equatorially 
but, with the advent of computer control, modern observatories 
(including moveable radio telescope dishes) have now adopted the 
alt-az system.
Big mirrors
Large modern telescopes have primary mirrors with geometries 
different to Hale’s paraboloids. A paraboloid focuses incoming 
paraxial rays to a sharp spot, but the peripheral rays become 
smeared out into a distorted blob which grows a tail, or coma, like 
a comet. This so-called comatic aberration worsens the further an 
object is from the axis, and ultimately it limits the usable field of 
view. Many modern telescopes use the wider field optics of the 
Cassegrain Ritchey-Chrétien design (Figure 2(d)), which is based 
on hyperboloidal primary and secondary mirrors. Modern 
telescopes now also have smaller focal ratios. The focal ratio 
(or f-number) is the ratio of the focal length of the mirror to its 
diameter and is a measure of the ‘speed’ of the optics. The name

derives from photography: the lower the f-number, the faster the 
optics, and the shorter the exposure time needed to form an 
image. The trend over the last 50 years has been for f-numbers of 
telescopes to get smaller, and values below f/2 are now common.
The Hale Telescope has the largest thick solid-glass mirror that it 
is possible to make and, since the 1970s, designs have 
concentrated on thinner and lighter mirrors. Thin mirrors are 
floppy which means that they need active mechanical support to 
stay in shape. One variety, meniscus mirrors, are used in European 
Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescopes (VLTs), 
shown in Figure 4. Each of the VLT’s 8.2m, 17.5cm thick mirrors is 
supported by an ‘active optics’ system using 150 electro￾mechanical actuators supporting its back which correct the mirror 
figure in real time by computer-controlled feedback.
An alternative design is the segmented mirror, in which one large 
mirror is constructed from a number of smaller hexagonal 
segments, each part of the parent mirror shape. This technique was 
pioneered in the two 10m Keck telescopes (Figure 5), which are 
sited 80m apart on top of the extinct volcano Mauna Kea in Hawaii, 
4,145m above the Pacific Ocean. Each mirror segment is 1.8m 
across, 7.5cm thick, and computer-aligned. The Keck telescopes can

be operated individually or as an interferometer pair to increase 
their angular resolution. The largest segmented-mirror telescope 
currently operating is the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), located 
in La Palma (altitude 2,267m), with an aperture of 10.4m. The first 
space telescope to use a segmented mirror is the 18-segment, 6.5m 
mirror of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
Effects of the atmosphere
Most of the Earth’s atmosphere lies within 16km from the surface, 
and is composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen. It contains traces 
of water vapour, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Further out, the 
air gets thinner until it merges with outer space. In the ionosphere, 
a layer 75–1,000km high, atoms are ionized by solar radiation and 
high-energy cosmic ray particles from distant parts of the 
5. A Keck telescope primary mirror, showing the hexagonal segments.Big telescopes
25
Universe. While the atmosphere is an essential part of the 
biosphere, protecting life from harmful cosmic radiation, it also 
filters the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that reach 
the ground from space. The incident radiation spans a huge range 
of wavelengths in gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet (UV), visible 
light, infrared (IR), millimetre (mm) radiation, and radio. The 
transmission curve of radiation through the atmosphere is shown 
in Figure 6. Incoming high-energy gamma ray, X-ray, and UV 
photons have enough energy to tear electrons from atoms in the 
atmosphere, ionizing the gas and rendering the atmosphere 
opaque at these wavelengths. Below the violet end of the visible 
spectrum, the sharp increase in opacity is caused by the strong 
absorption of near-UV photons by atmospheric ozone (O3
).

At the longer wavelengths of infrared, water and carbon dioxide 
molecules absorb most of the radiation. These molecules absorb 
and emit infrared photons in a multitude of narrow vibrational 
lines, and it is these that produce the complex shape of the opacity 
curve. For wavelengths between about 1cm and 10m, a second 
transparent window opens up in the atmosphere which is used for 
radio observations. At even longer wavelengths, the incoming 
radiation is reflected back out into space. At such low wave 
frequencies, the ionospheric electrons are mobile enough to screen 
out the oscillating wave fields causing the ionosphere to act like a 
mirror. Earthbound short-wave radio operators exploit this 
mirroring effect when they communicate with stations over the 
horizon, by transmitting radio signals that bounce off the inside 
surface of the ionosphere. In fact, the Earth’s surface and the 
ionosphere behave rather like the walls of a waveguide (familiar in 
microwave technology). These surfaces define a cavity within 
which very low frequency electromagnetic waves are trapped and 
can propagate around the globe.
Although the atmosphere is transparent in the visible one-octave 
(400–800 nanometres, or nm) wavelength window, by night, the 
atmosphere is never completely dark. During the day, sunlight 
ionizes atoms in the atmosphere which recombine at night, 
emitting photons. The atmosphere also generates light when 
struck by energetic cosmic ray particles, producing a low-level 
emission called airglow. Such background light sources limit the 
sensitivity of ground-based telescopes.
Atmospheric blurring
At optical wavelengths, atmospheric turbulence defines the 
effective angular resolution of ground-based telescopes. 
Turbulence is driven by winds mixing cool and warm air streams 
generating high- and low-density air pockets which cause the 
bumpiness experienced by air travellers. Air refracts light by a 
small amount which, over the 100km-long path of photons Big telescopes
27
arriving from outer space, makes the stars twinkle. The flat 
wavefronts arriving from distant objects are distorted in their 
passage through turbulent cells in the atmosphere. Observing the 
stars through the dynamically fluctuating atmosphere is akin to 
trying to see a coin lying on the bed of a stream of rippling water.
The optical quality of the atmosphere is measured by a quantity 
called seeing, the degree to which the atmosphere smears out the 
point-like image of a star into a seeing disc. Seeing discs are 
typically one or two arcseconds across and, at the best observing 
sites, which are generally at high altitude, can be as small as 
0.5 arcseconds. However, even this size is 20 times coarser than 
the ideal diffraction limit of a 4m telescope. It turns out that the 
resolving power of a telescope with an aperture any larger than 
about 20cm is fixed by atmospheric seeing and not by the optical 
aperture. Despite this, bigger telescopes collect more photons 
enabling fainter objects to be observed.
Modern observatory-class telescopes counter the atmospheric 
blurring with a wavefront-correction method called adaptive 
optics (AO). AO removes the atmospheric distortion by 
restoring and flattening out wavefronts. The two key elements 
in an AO system are an optical wavefront detector (which 
measures the phase distortions of the incoming light), and a 
dynamically deformable mirror to apply corrections in real time. 
The wavefront detector is essentially an array of tiny telescopes, 
each of which measures the shift in position of a bright 
reference star from which the pattern of atmospheric distortion 
is computed. The deformable mirror is flexed in real time by 
piezoelectric actuators attached to its back and a computer 
feedback system restores the plane parallel wavefronts. An AO 
system relies on the presence of a bright point-source reference 
star lying in the field of view. If no suitable star happens to be 
there, an ‘artificial star’ is created by firing a laser beam from 
the telescope, tuned to excite sodium atoms at the top of the 
atmosphere.Observational Astronomy
28
Recording images
The development of photography in the mid-19th century 
revolutionized observational astronomy. Before photography, 
astronomers had only their eyes to observe with, and what was 
seen through the telescope could only be recorded in the form of 
hand-drawn sketches. Apart from eliminating human bias and 
error, photography has the added benefit of overcoming a natural 
limitation of the human eye. Similar to a movie camera, the eye 
makes a sequence of short exposures about 20 times a second. 
Such a refresh rate is good for detecting motion, but it limits the 
number of photons captured, and hence sensitivity. A long 
photographic exposure not only reveals much fainter objects, but it 
also accurately captures the positions and magnitudes of many of 
them at the same time, establishing an objective record of the sky.
A dramatic improvement in the efficiencies of telescopes has come 
through the development of sensitive electronic light sensors 
which now replace the photographic plates that were in common 
use until the early 1980s. Electronic detectors are sensitive to a 
wider range of wavelengths than either the eye or photographic 
emulsion. Light is detected by the photoelectric effect in materials, 
the transfer of energy from photons to release photoelectrons, 
producing a small electrical current. The efficiency of a light 
sensor is defined by the Quantum Efficiency (QE), namely the 
fraction of incoming photons converted into useful signals. The 
QE of the eye and the light-sensitive grains in a photographic 
emulsion is only a few percent. In 1969, Willard Boyle and George 
Smith of Bell Laboratories in New Jersey invented a new type of 
light sensor, the Charge Coupled Device (CCD). CCD sensors have 
QEs approaching 100 per cent and have revolutionized 
astronomical imaging. Simply by replacing the photographic plate 
with a CCD sensor the sensitivity of a telescope can be boosted 
about 40 times. In terms of light-capture efficiency, it is as if the 
telescope’s aperture had been increased six-fold.Big telescopes
29
A CCD detector is a silicon chip that counts the photons that fall 
on a chequerboard array of micron-sized photosensitive cells 
(photosites). When a visible light photon strikes a photosite, a 
photoelectron is released and stored. As more photons rain down 
on the chip, the photosites fill up with electrons, collecting like 
raindrops in buckets. An image from a telescope is represented as 
a 2D pattern of electrical charge in the CCD. After an exposure, 
the accumulated charges are read out from the pixels and stored 
digitally. The CCD is also a linear detector. The quantity of charge 
stored in a pixel is proportional to the number of photons that 
arrived during an exposure, a feature that is important in 
photometry, measuring the brightness of objects. CCD cameras 
are generally cooled to low temperatures to reduce thermal noise.
Many interesting objects in the Universe emit more infrared than 
visible light. These are cold objects such as brown dwarfs, planets, 
dust clouds, and galaxies near the edge of the Universe for which 
the visible light emitted has been redshifted to longer 
wavelengths. Infrared is less strongly absorbed by interstellar dust 
than visible light; infrared allows the interiors of dust-shrouded 
objects to be observed and enables us to see deep into the dusty 
disc of the Milky Way. The optical window in the atmosphere 
extends the visible part of the spectrum to longer near-infrared 
wavelengths (0.8 to 2.5 microns) and large observatory telescopes 
operate at both visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The pure 
silicon sensors in CCD cameras are sensitive to light with photon 
energies larger than about 1.1 electron volt (eV) (corresponding to 
a longest wavelength of 1.1 microns). However, at 2-microns 
wavelength, in the near-infrared, the photons only have 0.6eV 
which is not enough to release photoelectrons from silicon. (The 
eV is a convenient energy unit for the atomic scale where 1eV is 
the energy needed to move an electron through a potential 
difference of 1 volt.) To observe at longer wavelengths, alternative 
semiconductor materials have been developed, such as alloys of 
mercury, cadmium, and tellurium (HgCdTe) which are used in Observational Astronomy
30
infrared sensor arrays such as the Near Infrared Camera 
(NIRCam) on the JWST.
The supermassive black hole in the centre 
of the Milky Way
The interstellar dust clouds in the disc of the Milky Way contain 
micron-sized grains of graphite and silicates. Since these grains 
are larger than the wavelengths of visible light they both absorb 
and scatter light. When light interacts with a dust grain, the 
oscillating electric fields force its electrons to vibrate in sympathy, 
turning the grains into quivering electric dipoles (spatially 
separated positive and negative charges) that reradiate the light 
energy, scattering it in all directions like miniature broadcasting 
stations. Importantly, the scattering efficiency is much higher at 
visible wavelengths than it is in the near-infrared. Observations 
made in the infrared therefore allow observers to see through all 
the obscuring dust, all the way to the centre of the Milky Way, and 
were therefore key to making the observations that confirmed the 
presence there of a supermassive compact object. The centre of 
the galaxy contains a compact radio source called Sagittarius A* 
(Sgr A*) and it was this region that had been suspected of 
harbouring a supermassive black hole.
A black hole is a highly compact massive object, with all the mass 
concentrated at a single point, a singularity, where the density is 
unimaginably high and the laws of classical physics break down. 
The singularity is unobservable because it is enclosed by an event 
horizon, a surface that cuts off a region of spacetime from the 
outside world. Near the event horizon the gravitational field is so 
strong that Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity is needed to 
describe the weird warping of space and time that occurs. In a 
non-spinning black hole, the radius of the event horizon is known 
as the Schwarzschild radius, named after the German physicist 
Karl Schwarzschild. The Schwarzschild radius can be defined for 
any massive body and has the property that if all the mass of the Big telescopes
31
body were to shrink down into a sphere of that radius, the escape 
velocity from the surface would reach the speed of light and so 
nothing, including light, can escape from it. If you were watching 
a clock falling into a black hole, the clock would appear to tick 
slower and slower as it approached the event horizon. The image 
of the clock would also get dimmer and redder and, as it reached 
the horizon, the time indicated on its dial would be frozen as it 
faded from view. This effect is the gravitational redshift which 
occurs because the photons emitted by the object lose energy as 
they climb out of the deep gravitational potential well. 
Astronomers estimate there to be around 100 million black holes 
in the Milky Way; these result from the collapse of massive stars, 
with masses as high as 150 solar masses. However, the 
supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way is much 
more massive than any of these stellar corpses.
If a black hole is truly ‘black’ and emits no light, it is reasonable to 
ask how it can be observed at all. The method that was used to 
identify the Sgr A* supermassive black hole was to make 
observations of the orbits and speeds of individual stars orbiting 
close to it. Owing to the black hole’s extreme mass and 
compactness, stars close to it attain exceedingly high velocities. 
Studying the orbits of these stars therefore informs us on the mass 
of the invisible central object. The galactic centre is, however, also 
crowded with numerous stars and star clusters. Therefore, to rule 
out other confounding effects, it was necessary to measure 
individual stellar orbits as close to the centre as possible. The key 
idea is that the velocities of stars orbiting in the immensely strong 
gravity of the black hole should be extremely high (much larger 
than if they were orbiting around star clusters for example). The 
observations needed a very high angular resolution, and the orbits 
of stars were followed for more than three decades using the Keck 
and the VLT telescopes equipped with AO at a wavelength of 
2.2 microns (Figure 7). The results clearly indicated the presence 
of a supermassive black hole with a mass of 4 million solar masses. 
One star in particular, S2, has a highly eccentric orbit and a short Observational Astronomy
32
orbital period of 16 years. S2 came within 120 AU of Sgr A* in 
2018, where it made its closest approach to the black hole at a 
speed of 7,600km per second (3 per cent of the speed of light), 
making it the fastest known ballistic orbit so far recorded. S2 
provides an excellent laboratory to test Einstein’s General Theory 
of Relativity. To that end, spectroscopic observations have 
detected the gravitational redshift of S2’s spectral lines, an effect 
that had never before been seen in a star near a black hole.
Sky surveys
Sky surveys are the foundation of observational astronomy. The 
aim is to collect data from well-defined areas of the sky, 
wavelengths, and limiting sensitivities with no specific prior 
astronomical targets. Having captured, digitized, and entered the 
data into a database, a large number of studies can be undertaken, 
such as cross-correlation with surveys made at other wavelengths 
or observation times. Astronomical surveys offer three types of 
information: investigation of the statistics of different types of 
objects in the Universe, a way of discovering new types of object,

centre of the Milky Way.Big telescopes
33
and the means to select objects for further observations with big 
telescopes. The objects in the database can also be presented to 
millions of citizen scientists for classification in online projects 
such as Galaxy Zoo.
The sky occupies a total of 41,254 square degrees, equivalent to 
206,270 full Moons. This is a huge area for a telescope to cover. 
The first big telescopes of the 20th century typically had fields of 
view of around 1°, which meant they were good for seeing detail in 
small regions of the sky but made poor survey instruments since it 
would have taken an enormous time for them to complete a 
whole-sky survey. The need for wide-field auxiliary survey 
telescopes with fast optics was recognized early on and was met by 
a radically different type of reflecting telescope.
The Schmidt camera (Figure 2(f)) was invented in 1930 by an 
Estonian optician, Bernhard Schmidt, who abandoned the 
then-usual paraboloidal mirror for a spheroidal one which is 
much easier to make. All spherical mirrors (and lenses) suffer 
from the optical defect of spherical aberration, where the outer 
marginal rays are reflected (or refracted) too steeply for the image 
to be in focus. To correct for this, Schmidt added a weakly 
refracting corrector plate to the front of the telescope. A telescope 
that combines reflecting and refracting elements is called a 
catadioptric telescope. The large mirror-diameter-to-focal-length 
ratio (small f/number) of a Schmidt camera offers fast optics and a 
wide field of view, and is therefore ideal for making surveys of the 
sky. The prototype 18-inch (0.46m) Schmidt camera at the 
Palomar observatory was used very effectively by Swiss 
astronomer Fritz Zwicky from 1936 to discover many supernovae. 
This was followed in 1950 by the famous Samuel Oschin 48-inch 
(1.2m) Schmidt camera which has a 47 square degree field of view 
(equivalent to 200 full Moons), and could complete a survey of the 
northern sky in four years. The image plane in this telescope is 
curved, and so specially curved glass photographic plates had to 
be used. The survey plates it produced for the National Observational Astronomy
34
Geographic Society–Palomar Sky Survey continue to provide a 
valuable resource, and the survey was digitized in 1994.
Galaxies are building blocks of the Universe, and galaxy surveys 
provide information on one of the foundations of physical 
cosmology—the study of the large-scale structure of the Universe. 
The simplest type of observation is the study of the positions of 
galaxies on the sky, plotting them as millions of points on the 
celestial sphere. The results show that galaxies are not distributed 
randomly across the sky, but are clumped on the different scales of 
the cosmic web. If, in addition, the redshift of each galaxy is also 
measured (making it a redshift survey), then the Hubble law can 
be used to estimate the galaxy distances, so revealing their 3D 
distribution in space. An example is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) which comes from a robotic 2.5m telescope located at 
Apache Point, in New Mexico. Figure 8 shows an SDSS redshift 
survey plotting galaxies over a quarter of the sky. In practical 
terms, measuring spectroscopic redshifts for each of a million 
galaxies would be extremely time consuming. Astronomers have 
therefore devised a much quicker method—estimating them 
photometrically. Photometric redshifts are based on 
approximating the visible light spectrum of a galaxy by observing 
it with a few (around five) relatively broad wavelength optical 
filters. The intensities measured in each of these yield data from 
which the redshift can then be extracted by comparison with 
reference templates.
The cosmic web shows the hierarchical distribution of galaxies on 
different scales. It shows giant superclusters of galaxies, clusters 
containing hundreds to thousands of galaxies, all the way down to 
smaller groups of a few tens of galaxies, such as the Local Group, 
to which our Milky Way galaxy belongs. The clusters are 
interlinked by filaments and dense walls of galaxies and, between 
the clumps, there are vast empty voids, up to 300 million light 
years across.Big telescopes

Robotic telescopes and the discovery of 
extrasolar planets
Smaller telescopes have many important roles. Groups of 
telescopes can be spread over different sites and operated 
robotically to form effectively a single instrument. These are 
coordinated in global networks which can respond rapidly to 
astronomical transients. For example, the Las Cumbres 
Observatory Global Telescope Network consists of 25 autonomous 
telescopes with apertures between 0.4m and 2m, distributed over 
sites in Australia, South Africa, Tenerife, Texas and Hawaii in the

USA, Chile, and Israel. On receipt of an alert such as a gamma-ray 
burst, neutrino, or a gravitational wave detection, this system 
ensures that there will be telescopes on the night side of the Earth 
available for follow-up observations in both hemispheres. A fully 
robotic telescope, such as the 2m Liverpool Telescope on La Palma, 
can, for example, be pointed at a new transient source within 
minutes of the receipt of an alert.
An extrasolar planet, or exoplanet, is a planet orbiting a star 
other than the Sun. Astronomers had dreamed for centuries of 
discovering exoplanets. Trying to see an exoplanet using its 
directly reflected light is difficult because the light from their 
surfaces is billions of times fainter than that of their host stars. 
It is akin to trying to see a firefly buzzing around a powerful but 
distant searchlight pointing straight at you. Indirect methods of 
detecting exoplanets like the radial velocity method offer a much 
easier route. When a planet orbits its star, they both orbit around 
the common centre of mass, making the star wobble a little. The 
periodic modulation of the star’s radial velocity shows up as a 
regular shifting of its spectral lines, blueshifted when the star is 
approaching, and redshifted when receding. The first exoplanets 
ever detected were observed at radio wavelengths, by Polish 
astronomer Alex Wolszczan and Canadian astronomer Dale Frail 
in 1992. They discovered exoplanets orbiting around a collapsed 
star—a pulsar (PSR B1257+12). A pulsar is a rapidly rotating type 
of neutron star emitting regular clock-like blips of radiation. The 
arrival times of the pulses from PSR B1257+12 were observed to 
vary systematically indicating the presence of three exoplanets.
The first detection of an exoplanet orbiting a normal star 51 Pegasi 
(51 Peg b; Figure 9) was made three years later by Didier Queloz 
and Michel Mayor using the 1.9m telescope at the Observatoire de 
Haute Provence in France. They used a high-resolution 
spectrometer to measure radial velocities with a precision of a few 
metres per second. The orbit of 51 Peg b revealed two remarkable 
facts: the exoplanet has a large Jupiter-like mass, and its orbital Big telescopes
37
period is only 4.2 days, indicating that it orbits closer to its star 
than Mercury does to the Sun. This was the first hot Jupiter to be 
observed, and a spate of observations and exoplanet discoveries 
soon followed. Over 5,000 or so exoplanetary systems have now 
been discovered, and a significant fraction of these are hot 
Jupiter types.
A different method of detecting exoplanets is the transit method, 
which relies on the tiny dimming of the light from a star when a 
planet passes in front of it. It is relatively easy to detect large 
planets this way. If, for example, an alien astronomer happened to

be looking in our direction, they would see the transit of Jupiter 
dimming the Sun’s brightness by 1 per cent. But for smaller 
planets, they would find this a more challenging measurement; for 
example, the transit dimming of the Earth would be 100 times 
smaller. Small ground-based telescopes, equipped with high￾precision photometric detectors, are discovering exoplanets by the 
transit method. Two robotic telescopes, the (super) Wide-Angle 
Search for Planets (or super-WASP), covering both hemispheres, 
are based in South Africa and La Palma. These wide-field 
telescopes each consist of a stack of eight commercial camera 
lenses, attached to CCD cameras. The telescopes monitor the 
brightness of 100,000 stars, searching for exoplanets. Super￾WASP has, to date, discovered 75 exoplanets, a high scientific 
return for a relatively small investment.
Two future optical telescopes
The largest next-generation infrared and optical telescope is the 
ESO’s European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT; Figure 10). 
The E-ELT will have a 39m (f/1) segmented mirror, and is 
currently under construction at Paranal Observatory in Chile with 
first light currently estimated as 2028. It is designed to achieve a 
diffraction limited angular resolution of 0.01 arcsecond at a 
wavelength of 2 microns, and will extend studies of exoplanets 
and their atmospheres, searching for the spectral signatures of 
biomarkers including ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapour, as 
well as looking for the first galaxies, and studying supermassive 
black holes and dark energy.
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory (previously the Large Synoptic 
Survey Telescope) is currently being built in Chile with first light 
expected by 2024. A novel feature about this powerful 8.4m 
robotic survey telescope is a three-mirror design which will 
produce a wide field of view (3.5°; equivalent to 50 full Moons). 
The camera consists of a mosaic of 189 16-megapixel CCDs, making 
it the largest digital camera ever built, about the size of a car. Big telescopes
39
The observatory will survey the same half of the southern sky 
(10,000 square degrees) every three days. This high cadence will 
enable it to make ‘movies’ of the sky and discover many transient 
and moving objects, such as supernovae, near-Earth objects, 
gamma-ray burst counterparts, and variable stars. The databases 
will contain about 20 billion galaxies, and a similar number of 
stars. It will also measure the gravitational lensing of dark matter 
and create maps showing the evolution of dark matter.
This chapter has introduced some of the exciting advances in 
astronomy and astrophysics made by ground-based optical and 
near-infrared telescopes and the new technologies that have made 
the observations possible. However, these wavebands occupy only 
a small segment of the electromagnetic spectrum and, next, we 
will keep our feet on the ground and our eyes on the stars, but 
look at them with wavelengths a million times longer.

Chapter 3
The radio Universe
Radio emission from the cosmos was first observed accidentally in 
1933 by an engineer working for Bell Telephone Laboratories in 
New Jersey. Karl Jansky had been trying to track down a radio 
hiss that had been interfering with a transatlantic radiotelephone 
service and, to locate the interference, had constructed a rotatable 
directional antenna tuned to a wavelength of 15m. The radio noise 
appeared to be coming from one direction which, over the course 
of a year, changed steadily by 1° per day (moving with the stars at 
the sidereal rate). This indicated it had a celestial origin, which 
Jansky identified as coming from the Milky Way, an observation 
that makes him the first radio astronomer. Jansky is twice 
honoured by having the basic astronomical unit of radio flux 
density named after him, as well as one of the world’s largest radio 
telescopes, the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) telescope 
in New Mexico.
Jansky’s discovery was followed up a few years later by a radio 
enthusiast, Grote Reber. Using a 9m home-made parabolic dish in 
his Illinois back garden, Reber mapped the radio noise from the 
Milky Way at a wavelength of 2m. His dish was mounted as a 
transit telescope, which he used to record the brightness of the 
radio sky in the form of drift scans made at different altitudes. 
When the data were plotted as a contour map, it clearly showed The radio Universe
41
the radio emission coming from the plane of the Milky Way, with 
the peak of intensity centred on the constellation of Sagittarius.
The question was: what is the source of this galactic radio 
emission? All bodies radiate electromagnetic radiation, simply 
because they are hot. Stars are a good example of this. Thermal 
radiation has a broad spectrum of wavelengths, the Planck 
spectrum, after the German physicist Max Planck who, in 1900, 
derived the formula for thermal radiation by postulating that light 
energy is quantized. Electromagnetic radiation is produced 
whenever electrical charges are accelerated, and those in a hot body 
are constantly in a state of random agitation; the radiation from 
such a mêlée of jiggling charges is emitted with many wavelengths. 
The hotter the body, the more violent the agitated motion, and the 
wider the range of frequencies that are emitted. A body emitting a 
Planck spectrum peaks at a characteristic frequency which depends 
solely on its temperature. Think of a chunk of iron heated up to 
forging temperatures in a blacksmith’s workshop. At first it glows 
dull red, then bright orange-yellow, and finally a brilliant blue-white 
colour. (Even when cooled to room temperature, the iron continues 
to radiate, but its emission peak now shifts to long infrared 
wavelengths to which our eyes are not sensitive.) It turns out that the 
colour of a hot body can be used as a proxy for its temperature 
(hence the term ‘colour temperature’). This is why it is possible to 
estimate the temperature of stars from their colours.
However, the radio noise emitted by the Milky Way does not have 
the same form of thermal spectrum emitted by stars, nor does it 
have a discrete line spectrum, such as that emitted by excited 
atoms. Instead, the radio noise has a continuous spectrum, and 
Reber showed that it was much stronger at low frequencies than 
at high frequencies. The Milky Way’s radio emission was also 
found to be polarized, and this gave an important clue to its 
origin. In an electromagnetic wave, the electric and magnetic 
fields oscillate in directions perpendicular to the direction of Observational Astronomy
42
propagation. If the radiation source is a hot body, the field 
directions are uncorrelated and the light is unpolarized. For the 
cosmic radio waves to have been polarized, they must have been 
produced by a non-thermal process. The mechanism was 
synchrotron radiation, a type of radiation emitted by fast 
electrons deflected into helical corkscrew paths by magnetic fields. 
This has the effect of aligning the oscillating wave fields in one 
particular direction. Synchrotron radiation is produced in 
laboratory particle accelerators such as cyclotrons and 
synchrotrons, and the mechanism is now recognized to operate in 
a wide variety of cosmic sources. In an active galactic nucleus
(AGN), for example, electrons are accelerated to relativistic 
energies, causing them to gyrate in magnetic fields and emit 
polarized radiation. In the Milky Way, electrons are also 
accelerated in shock waves around the expanding shells of 
supernovae, and they emit synchrotron radiation when they 
encounter galactic magnetic fields.
Immediately following Jansky’s and Reber’s discoveries, the 
embryonic science of radio astronomy had to be put on hold by 
the advent of World War II but, afterwards, the tremendous 
technical advances in electronics, radio, and radar technology that 
had taken place during the war years enabled the field to take off 
rapidly. Radio scientists such as James Hay, Bernard Lovell, and 
Martin Ryle in the UK, and Joseph Pawsey in Australia, all of 
whom had been involved in the development of radar, turned their 
attention to the new astronomy.
Large single-dish radio telescopes were constructed, such as 
Bernard Lovell’s 250-foot (76m) diameter steerable Lovell 
Telescope (Figure 11), built in 1957 at Jodrell Bank Observatory, 
England. Its many observations include monitoring space probes 
such as the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, as well as mapping 
planets, pulsars, galaxies, and quasars. Other single-dish 
telescopes include the famous 305m-diameter dish of the Arecibo 
Observatory in Puerto Rico (which collapsed catastrophically in The radio Universe
43
2020), the steerable 100m-diameter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) 
in West Virginia and the Five-hundred metre Aperture Spherical 
radio Telescope (FAST) in Guizhou, China. The GBT is itself a 
replacement of an earlier telescope which also collapsed 
catastrophically in 1988, indicating how close to engineering 
limits large telescope technology is being pushed.
Interferometers
Radio wavelengths are a million times longer than those of visible 
light. So, for a single-dish radio telescope to match the angular 
resolution of an optical telescope, its aperture would have to be 
bigger by the same factor. While it is not possible to make such a 
large single dish, it is nevertheless a fact that radio telescopes 
have not only equalled the resolving power of their optical 
counterparts, but in some cases they have exceeded it. How was 
this done? Big radio telescopes consist of arrays of many small 
11. The 250-foot dish of the Lovell Radio Telescope at Jodrell Bank.Observational Astronomy
44
antennas, often spread over many kilometres, sometimes 
spanning continents, but always connected together to work as 
one instrument. An antenna array can be broken down into a 
number of basic units of which one is a pair of antennas connected 
together as an interferometer. While a single antenna might have a 
coarse resolution, a pair of antennas, configured as an 
interferometer, can achieve much higher resolution.
The phenomenon of the interference between two waves was used 
to prove that light is a wave, and was first demonstrated by the 
English scientist Thomas Young in 1801. When waves come 
together, they add to and interfere with one another (Figure 12). 
By throwing two pebbles into a smooth pond, the circular ripples 
from each spread out and cross through those from the other. 
Wherever ripples overlap, each adds itself wholly to the other. 
Where two equal crests meet, they interfere constructively to 
produce a single double-height wave (Figure 12(a)), where two 
equal depth troughs meet they make one of double depth, and 
where a crest meets a trough they cancel completely (destructive 
interference) so that the water remains level (Figure 12(b)). Young 
showed that light has precisely these properties. In his famous 
double-slit experiment (Figure 12(c)), light is prepared by 
diffracting it through a narrow slit in a screen, causing it to spread 
out on the other side. This ensures the light is coherent and comes 
from the same point-like source. The light then passes through a 
pair of slits in a second screen and again spreads out, but this 
time it interferes with itself to form a set of bright and dark 
stripes (such as at points C and D of Figure 12(c)) on a screen; 
this is a diffraction pattern containing interference fringes. 
The bright fringes indicate constructive interference and are 
regions where the paths from the two slits differ by exactly a 
whole number of wavelengths, so that the crests of the waves 
arrive there together and add to each other. The dark fringes 
indicate destructive interference where the wave trains differ by 
an odd number of half wavelengths, arrive out of phase, and 
cancel each other.The radio Universe

Young’s experiment translates to a radio interferometer. In 
Figure 13(a) two radio antennas, A and B, are connected so that 
their signals add together, forming an interferometer. The 
antennas are placed on an east–west baseline, a distance D apart, 
where they are both pointed towards a radio source. An incoming 
wavefront reaches antenna B first. But, to reach antenna A, the 
wave has to travel an extra distance AC, the path difference. The 
time delay between the two signals depends on the direction of the 
source and the spacing between the antennas. As the Earth 
rotates, the radio source drifts through the beam of the 
interferometer, changing the path difference AC and generating 
interference fringes as the two signals interfere with each other. 
The fringes show up as a sinusoidal variation of the interferometer 
output which is shown in the figure as modulating the much 
broader envelope of a single-antenna beam pattern. The fringe 
pattern can be thought of as a series of lobes projected onto the 
sky, spaced apart by an angle of the ratio of the wavelength to the 
antenna separation, D. This angle defines the angular resolution 
of the interferometer.
The difference in brightness between the maxima and minima of 
the fringes is called the fringe visibility, an important quantity that 
contains information about the angular distribution of the source, 
i.e. its radio ‘image’. There are three possibilities. First, if the 
source is point-like, such as a quasar, the fringe visibility is large 
and, in between interference peaks, the interferometer output falls 
to zero indicating that the source is not resolved. Second, if the 
source is broader and therefore partially resolved, the minima do 
not reach zero, and the fringe visibility is reduced. Third, if the 
source is uniformly bright across the sky, the output is constant 
and no fringes are produced.
Comparing Young’s experiment with the radio interferometer, one 
can think of the light from the single slit as representing the point 
radio source, the two slits in the second screen representing the 
pair of radio antennas, and the fringes projected on the screen as The radio Universe

those of the radio interferometer. In Young’s experiment, the 
fringes are spread out spatially on the screen. But they can be 
made to vary in time by placing a light meter in the centre of the 
screen (at point E in Figure 12(c)) and recording its time-varying 
output as the light source is moved steadily in a vertical direction. 
This would mimic the drift of the quasar across the sky.
Mapping the radio sky
To turn interferometer measurements into radio maps of the sky, 
one more idea is needed. With the example of a pair of pebbles 
thrown into a pond, the complex wave interference pattern in the 
water comes from adding just two waves. In 1822 the French 
mathematical physicist Joseph Fourier discovered that any
waveform, however complex, can be represented by adding 
together many pure sinusoidal waves. These are called Fourier 
components. The complex waveform can be any type of signal, 
such as the sound vibrations from a note played on a violin. In this 
case the sound waveform consists of a spectrum of sinusoidal 
tones based on a fundamental note (the perceived pitch of the 
note), plus a set of harmonics, the Fourier components, which 
add together to produce the familiar violin timbre. Fourier’s 
method is a powerful way of representing all kinds of waveforms, 
including the 2D distribution of brightness in images, such as a 
photograph or a radio map of the sky. All these can be 
decomposed into their spatial Fourier components. Provided 
enough components are added together, considering their phases 
and amplitudes, the original image can be reconstructed using 
Fourier synthesis.
Aperture synthesis is the technique of creating one very 
large telescope aperture from a number of interferometers. 
A single-spacing interferometer is sensitive to one spatial 
component of the sky brightness distribution and, by varying the 
spacing, the interferometer produces a set of Fourier components, The radio Universe
49
corresponding to structure on different angular scales. Imagine 
dividing up the surface of the very large radio telescope aperture 
to be synthesized into many smaller areas, each containing a 
smaller antenna (Figure 13(b)). The signals from all the antenna 
pairs are connected and added with the correct phases so as to 
mimic the time delays of each of the rays reflecting from the big 
dish. The time delays can be introduced either by using different 
length interconnecting cables or optical fibres (as shown) or, as is 
now done, by correlating the signals in a computer. In practice it is 
unnecessary to cover the whole area of the imagined large dish 
with small antennas, nor is it essential to acquire all the signals 
simultaneously provided the source does not vary during the 
observations. Instead, parts of the dish can be sampled at different 
times, and a smaller number of antennas moved around to build 
up the radio image gradually.
An important development in radio astronomy was Earth￾rotation synthesis, in which antennas are arranged on an 
east–west line. Owing to the 24-hour rotation of the Earth, the 
antennas effectively rotate around each other every day, as seen 
from the distant stars. By repeating the observations with 
different antenna spacings, it is possible to sample the different 
Fourier components of the source. Earth-rotation synthesis was 
pioneered by English astronomer Martin Ryle at the Mullard 
Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO) in Cambridge, England, 
using three 60-feet-diameter dishes of the One-Mile Telescope 
riding on an east–west section of the long-defunct Oxford to 
Cambridge railway line. The first aperture synthesis radio map, 
the North Pole Survey, was published in 1962. A large modern 
aperture synthesis array is the JVLA telescope (Figure 14), 
consisting of 27 25m dishes, laid out in a Y-pattern with 21km-long 
arms. The dishes can be moved around on railway tracks. The 
telescope operates at wavelengths from 30cm to 6mm, at which 
the angular resolution is 0.04 arcseconds, comparable with the 
resolving power of a large optical telescope.Observational Astronomy

Quasars
From the beginning, interferometer observations revealed many 
bright, discrete radio sources but, at first, the measured positions 
were too imprecise to identify optical counterparts. As techniques 
improved, two of the strongest radio emitters, Cygnus A 
(first observed by Reber in 1939) and Cassiopeia A, were identified 
respectively with a young supernova remnant in the Milky Way, 
and a faint galaxy with a redshift distance of 760 million light 
years. The big surprise was the discovery that the radio emission 
from Cygnus A came not from the body of the galaxy, but from 
two enormous radio lobes dwarfing the central optical galaxy 
(Figure 15). The synchrotron-emitting radio lobes in Cygnus A are 
powered by two highly aligned beams of particles and radiation 
(jets) emerging from the central galaxy in opposite directions, 
which are highly collimated over enormous distances. In the

centre, the AGN harbours a powerful quasar, a supermassive black 
hole which is actively accreting matter.
Many of the bright radio sources seen in the first large-scale radio 
surveys could not be resolved, even with the widest interferometer 
spacings then available. The position of one of the brightest of 
these sources, 3C273 (object 273 in the 3C or the Third 
Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources), was pinpointed by 
Australian astronomers in 1963 using the 64m Parkes radio dish 
using the technique of lunar occultation. The positional 
information enabled Dutch astronomer Maarten Schmidt to use 
the 200-inch Palomar telescope to identify 3C273 with a peculiar 
bright blue star-like galaxy, emitting continuum radiation and 
having unusually broad optical emission lines, indicating highly 
excited gas. This, the first quasar, was strongly redshifted 
(z = 0.158) implying a distance of three billion light years. This 
distance enabled astronomers to infer that the galaxy has an 
unprecedented luminosity of four trillion times that of the Sun,

galaxies. More quasars were soon identified, many with even 
higher redshifts. As these data accumulated, the number density 
of quasars could be studied over cosmological timescales and 
distances. The statistics revealed that the quasar population 
peaked at redshifts between z = 1 and z = 3, corresponding to 
light-travel times between about six and eight billion years. 
Quasar observations were crucial in showing that galaxies have 
undergone significant evolution in the history of the Universe.
Supermassive black holes and their jets
Once it had been established that quasars are the sites of the most 
powerful sustained energy releases known in the Universe, the 
question was: what could possibly light up one galaxy with the 
power that illuminates a hundred? One clue came from the 
observation of their rapid time variability. The luminosities of 
quasars can fluctuate on short timescales, as rapidly as in tens of 
minutes, indicating that their emitting regions are extremely 
small, less than a few AU. (Any object whose luminosity varies 
rapidly must be physically smaller than the light-travel time across 
the object, otherwise the variations are smoothed out.) The most 
powerful energy release mechanism then known was the process 
that powers the stars, thermonuclear fusion. However, fusion 
reactions can release at most only around 0.7 per cent of the rest 
mass energy of matter, which was considered insufficient to 
explain the luminosity of a quasar.
In 1963 the New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr solved 
Einstein’s equations for a spinning black hole which showed that 
the spacetime outside the event horizon, and any objects that 
happen to be there, get dragged around the hole as if caught in a 
whirlwind. This prompted the English physicist Roger Penrose to 
propose that energy can be extracted from a spinning black hole 
by the fragmentation of objects falling into the black hole from 
outside the event horizon; some fragments fall in, and others fly 
off. Depending on the details, up to 42 per cent of the rest mass The radio Universe
53
energy of matter can be extracted from a spinning black hole, a 
much more efficient process than fusion and one that is now the 
leading candidate for a quasar’s power source. The great 
luminosities of quasars therefore pointed to the release of 
gravitational binding energy when matter accretes onto a 
supermassive black hole. The strong curvature of spacetime 
surrounding a black hole is indicated in Figure 16(a), showing the 
deep gravitational potential energy well. An object falling towards 
a black hole from infinity acquires a large amount of kinetic 
energy from the gravitational field. Think of the water in a gently 
flowing river gradually picking up energy from the Earth’s 
gravitational field as it approaches a waterfall before cascading 
downwards at high speed.
In an active quasar, such as the one depicted in Figure 16(b), 
radiation exerts an outward pressure force on the infalling matter. 
For accretion onto any massive luminous body there is a 
maximum luminosity (the ‘Eddington luminosity’) above which 
the radiation pressure will overwhelm gravity and blow away any 
material which is trying to accrete. English astrophysicist Arthur 
Eddington had originally introduced this limit when considering 
the accretion of matter onto massive stars. When the Eddington

54
limit was applied to the extreme luminosities in quasars like 
3C273, it showed that the central object must have a mass of at 
least 1 billion solar masses to hold it together. A supermassive 
black hole with this mass has an event horizon of three billion 
kilometres; on the scale of the solar system such a black hole 
would fit comfortably within the orbit of Neptune.
The infalling matter powering an AGN can be in any form, for 
example, an interstellar gas cloud, star, or planet. As it approaches 
the black hole, the material experiences strong tidal forces which 
stretch it out into long strands, a process that has been called 
spaghettification. The matter will generally possess some 
rotational angular momentum, causing the material to flatten out 
into a thin, dense accretion disc rotating around the black hole. As 
the matter falls in, it spins up, in line with the law of conservation 
of angular momentum. A pirouetting ice skater uses the law when 
she first goes into a slow spin with arms outstretched and pulls 
them in to her body to produce a spectacular fast spin. The viscous 
friction between the fast-spinning inner disc and the slower 
rotating outer material heats the material to tens of millions of 
degrees, where it radiates copious amounts of gamma rays and 
X-rays. Further out, in the cooler parts of the disc, the radiation 
peaks respectively in the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared 
wavebands. The viscous frictional forces in the disc also transfer 
angular momentum outwards, causing the matter nearest the 
black hole to spiral inwards. Eventually the matter arrives at the 
last stable circular orbit, which for a non-rotating black hole has a 
radius of 3 Schwarzschild radii (and smaller if the hole is 
rotating). There, it falls off the inside edge of the disc and passes 
through the event horizon. The accretion disc therefore regulates 
how fast the black hole feeds, by gently lowering the matter down 
into the throat of its deep gravitational potential well.
Active supermassive black holes in galaxies, their accretion discs, 
and their jets are the cosmic particle accelerators that power 
quasars. While the details of their workings are not well The radio Universe
55
understood, there are some basic, well-accepted ideas. 
The material in the accretion disc is hot ionized plasma, threaded 
by magnetic field lines which rotate around with the disc. It is 
likely that rotation winds up the magnetic field like spaghetti 
being wound around a fork, collimating the emerging beams of 
matter into narrow jets. The huge electric fields that exist in this 
region accelerate particles to ultra-relativistic energies, and shoot 
them out in both directions along the rotation axis. The spin of the 
black hole acts like a gyroscope, keeping the jets aligned to one 
direction. Further out, the jets punch their way out of the host 
galaxy, and plough into the tenuous intergalactic medium where, 
at great distances, they deposit their energy.
Observationally, there are two main classes of AGN: radio loud
and radio quiet types. If the central black hole is feeding 
voraciously on local sources of matter, it produces the powerful 
jets and radio lobes of the radio loud variety. If the black hole 
cannot access much matter, there is no significant emission from 
jets, the object is radio quiet, and lies dormant. AGN produce a 
broad range of observational phenomena depending in part on the 
observed orientation of the accretion disc. Encircling the accretion 
disc, and typically a few light years across, is an outer hollow 
doughnut-shaped ring (torus shape) of hot dusty material which 
absorbs the high-energy radiation from the centre. A range of 
different observational properties is produced depending on the 
orientation of the accretion disc with respect to the observer’s line 
of sight, as well as on the feeding activity of the black hole. For 
example, if the AGN is hidden by dust, the central radiation is 
absorbed and reradiated by the dust. In this case the AGN 
produces characteristic thermally broadened spectral lines. If, on 
the other hand, an active jet happens to be pointing almost 
towards the observer, it appears exceptionally bright and is known 
as a blazar. The increased brightening is caused by the 
enhancement of radiation emitted fast particles in the forward 
direction of motion, called relativistic beaming. Supermassive 
black holes in AGN are also believed to regulate the rate of growth Observational Astronomy
56
of galaxies. In an active phase, the jets deliver kinetic energy to the 
surrounding gas and, by heating it, prevents it from condensing 
down onto the galaxy.
Gravitational lensing
The simplest geometrical optics model of light tells us that it 
travels along straight lines in a vacuum. This works well on small 
length scales and away from any large masses. However, Einstein’s 
General Theory of Relativity predicts that light travels in straight 
lines only if the Universe is empty of matter. When mass is 
present, spacetime is curved, and light follows a curved (or 
geodesic) path. The American relativist John Wheeler put it 
crisply: ‘matter tells space how to curve, and space tells matter 
how to move’. Einstein’s prediction was confirmed in 1919 when 
Eddington measured the deflection of starlight around the Sun 
during a total solar eclipse, a special time when it is possible to 
observe distant stars close to the limb of the Sun.
Einstein had originally considered the possibility of observing the 
light from a distant star being deflected (lensed) by the gravity of a 
closer one that happens to be lying along the line of sight. The 
probability of such an alignment was, however, considered 
negligibly small. But the probabilities of lensing alignments are 
much bigger in the case of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The 
first gravitational lens was observed in 1979 in observations of the 
‘twin quasar’ (Q0957+561), two closely spaced quasars that 
appeared to have similar spectral signatures. In fact, it turned out 
that this odd object was a single quasar whose light rays had 
passed along two paths near an intervening mass, as indicated in 
Figure 17.
The enormous gravity of a cluster of galaxies can act as a lens to 
focus the light emitted by background objects, behaving like the 
objective lens of a telescope positioned out in deep space. The lens 
distorts the shapes of background objects by magnifying them and The radio Universe
57
shearing the light paths (tangentially stretching the image around 
the lensing mass). With strong lensing, distant galaxies appear as 
curved arcs or sometimes even full circles (Einstein rings) around 
the lensing masses.
Pulsars
In the 1960s, English radio astronomer Anthony Hewish built a 
special type of radio telescope, the Interplanetary Scintillation 
Array (ISA), at the MRAO in Cambridge, UK, which was designed 
to discover quasars. It was based on the principle that, at radio 
wavelengths, the bright point-like quasars are observed to 
‘twinkle’ (or scintillate) owing to their ray paths being multiply 
refracted in the turbulence of intervening interplanetary and 
interstellar plasmas. This effect is analogous to the ‘twinkling’ of 
the stars due to the passage of their light through the Earth’s 
atmosphere. Optically, planets do not appear to twinkle simply 
because, with their larger angular sizes, there is more cancellation 
of the fluctuations along multiple refraction paths. So, by 
observing how much a quasar scintillates, the ISA telescope could 
be used to estimate its angular diameter. The key feature of this 
telescope is that it needed to have a rapid response time to detect

the scintillation of quasars and so had to have a large collecting 
area to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Such a telescope design 
turned out to have unexpected consequences.
The ISA occupied an area of about two and a half football 
pitches and consisted of thousands of wire dipoles, tuned to a 
wavelength of 3.7m, and backed up by wire reflecting screens. 
It could be directed to different parts of the sky by electrically 
phasing the array. The telescope was operated initially by 
Hewish’s research student Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who, in 1967, 
came across a strange radio source (CP1919) pulsing with 
clock-like regularity, every 1.33 seconds. This could have been 
caused by mundane terrestrial interference, but the pulses 
always came from the same part of the sky. When other similar 
pulsing sources were found, with different periods, interference 
was ruled out. This was how pulsating radio stars, or pulsars, 
were discovered.
What kind of cosmic radio source produces regular ticks like a 
clock? The most likely explanation was that it must be some kind 
of small rotating object—sending out flashes like a lighthouse. The 
first thought was that the pulsar might be a white dwarf, the core 
of a star weighing less than 8 solar masses that, having run out of 
fusion fuel, has collapsed to a dense hot ember, about the size of 
the Earth. The pressure that stabilizes a white dwarf against 
gravitational collapse is electron degeneracy pressure. Electron 
degeneracy pressure stems from the quantum mechanical 
properties of electrons which prevents electrons being squeezed 
together too tightly. Electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle 
which forbids any two electrons in an atom from occupying the 
same quantum state and is named after Austrian physicist 
Wolfgang Pauli. The Indian astrophysicist Subrahmanyan 
Chandrasekhar calculated that a star weighing up to about 
1.4 solar masses (the Chandrasekhar limit), but no more, can be 
supported by electron degeneracy pressure alone. A white dwarf is The radio Universe
59
one of the densest known forms of matter, exceeded only by 
neutron stars and black holes. (A white dwarf is about the size of 
the Earth, but its density is around 200,000 times higher.)
It turns out that even a star as dense and compact as a white 
dwarf could not withstand the rapid rotation observed in 
pulsars—it would quite simply fly apart under the centrifugal 
forces. The observations instead pointed to an object that is bound 
together much more strongly, a neutron star. As early as 1934 
astronomers Fritz Zwicky and Walter Baade had predicted 
the possible existence of neutron stars, as being produced in 
core-collapse supernovae, but up to this point they had never been 
observed. The quantum degeneracy pressure supporting a neutron 
star against gravity comes from the neutrons. A neutron star can 
be thought of as being akin to a giant atomic nucleus, a tiny 
spherical object only around 10km across but weighing around 
2 solar masses, with a density about a million times higher than a 
white dwarf. A famous example is the pulsar in the Crab Nebula 
(Figure 18, top left image), which flashes 30 times a second. Other 
pulsars are observed to have periods as short as a millisecond.
A complete description of the underlying radiation mechanism of 
a pulsar is a complex and active research area, but the broad 
picture is this. A pulsar is believed to be a spinning, magnetized 
neutron star, the product of a core-collapse supernova. As in the 
pirouetting ice skater example, the conservation of angular 
momentum means that any small initial rotation of a star is 
amplified many times over during the collapse. A tiny, rapidly 
rotating object weighing perhaps 2 solar masses has a huge inertia 
which means that its rotation period will retain its clock-like 
precision over long periods of time. The signals from some 
pulsars, for example the Vela pulsar, have been observed to show 
sudden jumps (glitches) in the pulse rate. These are believed to be 
connected with ‘starquakes’, sudden contractions of the surface 
crust of the neutron star by distances in the order of centimetres. Observational Astronomy
60
The progenitor star will, prior to the explosion, have been 
threaded by a magnetic field which, during the collapse, is 
amplified enormously to make a magnet about a billion times 
stronger than a fridge magnet. A magnetized, rapidly rotating 
neutron star is a powerful electric generator. The electric field at 
the surface of the star is strong enough to pluck electrons out and 
accelerate them to near-light speed where, deflected into helices 
by the magnetic field, they emit synchrotron radiation. More than 
200 pulsars have now been discovered and they are observed to 
radiate pulses across all wavebands.

Another telescope with no moving parts
The development of fibre optic cables and massively powerful 
supercomputers has opened up efficient ways of building radio 
telescope arrays based on many omnidirectional fixed antennas 
spread over the surface of the Earth. These arrays employ 
‘beam-forming’ phased-array methods enabling them to be 
pointed anywhere in the sky. This approach resulted in 2012 in a 
Dutch telescope, the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), which 
operates at the longest wavelengths (2m–10m) observable from 
the Earth. The individual antennas are cheap, mass-producible 
items distributed over distances of hundreds of kilometres at sites 
from Ireland in the west to Latvia in the east, and from Sweden in 
the north to Italy in the south. LOFAR’s antennas can look in 
many directions at the same time. Being able to see a large part of 
the sky makes LOFAR a powerful survey telescope and therefore 
one well suited to discovering transient sources. Astronomers are 
hoping that LOFAR’s low frequency capabilities may shed light on 
one of the most important questions in astronomy: what 
happened in the Dark Age of the Universe. The Dark Age is a time 
before the first stars had formed when all normal matter was in 
the form of clouds of hydrogen and helium. The radio emission 
and absorption at a wavelength of 21cm from neutral hydrogen 
atoms from this epoch is thought to be observable but, owing to 
the expansion of the Universe, has been redshifted to wavelengths 
of around 4m. LOFAR hopes to observe this radiation which will 
be critical to our understanding of the earliest times immediately 
after the Big Bang.
Probing the cold Universe
Hydrogen is the most abundant constituent of the Universe, 
existing as ions (protons), neutral atoms, and H2
 molecules. 
The ground state of a hydrogen atom has two closely spaced 
(hyperfine) energy levels, and atoms flipping quantum states Observational Astronomy
62
between the parallel/anti-parallel spins of the electron and proton 
produce a radio (HI) line at a wavelength of 21cm. Observing the 
21cm radio line, both in emission and absorption, is an important 
branch of astronomy. Spectroscopic observations of the HI line 
emission intensities and Doppler shifts yield information on the 
quantity of hydrogen and its kinematics in galaxies. Since HI 
radiation is not appreciably absorbed by interstellar dust, it is 
possible to use it to observe the Milky Way’s hydrogen across the 
full width of the galactic disc, and this has revealed the otherwise 
unobservable spiral structure of our galaxy. Other atoms and 
molecules emit and absorb line radiation at radio and far-infrared 
wavelengths. The first molecule detected in the interstellar 
medium was the hydroxyl radical, OH, which has shown 
remarkable maser-like amplification properties in dense 
regions of the interstellar medium. (A maser is the microwave 
analogue of a laser.)
Spectral lines of other complex molecules lie in the submillimetre 
wavebands. Submillimetre telescopes require mirrors with 
near-optical surface accuracies and employ cooled germanium 
crystal bolometer detectors to observe the total radiant power. 
These instruments must be cooled to within a few degrees of 
absolute zero. Observational astronomy at such short radio 
wavelengths is challenging: astronomers have to work within the 
narrow windows between the many atmospheric water vapour 
absorption lines and only a handful of sites in the world are dry 
and dark enough for these observations. One is the summit of the 
dormant volcano of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the site of the 15m 
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), the largest single-dish 
telescope in the world operating in the 0.3mm–2mm waveband. It 
lies above a third of the Earth’s atmosphere and most of its water 
vapour. The JCMT has observed the emission from a population 
of starburst galaxies at large redshifts, a type undergoing 
extremely rapid star formation in which the intense ultraviolet 
radiation from hot newly formed stars is reradiated by dust at far 
infrared and submillimetre wavelengths. Observations show that The radio Universe
63
the star-forming rate in galaxies peaked about 10 billion years ago, 
about 2–3 billion years after the Big Bang, and has now dwindled 
to a much lower rate.
The submillimetre and millimetre wavebands contain a plethora 
of spectral lines from relatively complex molecules, including 
water, ammonia, ethanol, and methanol. While molecules can 
form in the interstellar medium by association in the gas phase, 
formation is more efficient when molecules stick to the surfaces of 
dust grains, conditions that prevail in star-forming regions. 
These stellar nurseries are associated with the million-solar-mass 
Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), dense regions of the interstellar 
medium where temperatures are just a few tens of degrees above 
absolute zero, and gas clouds readily clump together under gravity. 
GMCs shine brightly in the far-infrared and are observed 
with telescopes equipped with arrays of highly sensitive 
superconducting bolometric sensors.
The most powerful telescope in the world studying the cold 
Universe is the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array 
(ALMA), an aperture synthesis telescope operating at wavelengths 
between 0.3mm and 3.6mm, sited in one of the driest places on 
Earth—the Chajnantor plateau, 5km high in the Chilean Andes 
(Figure 19). ALMA has 66 paraboloidal dishes, linked by fibre 
optic cables. The dishes are moveable, and can either be gathered 
together to give a wide-angle view, or spread out 16km apart to 
zoom in on fine detail with an angular resolution of 0.006 
arcseconds. Making images at these short wavelengths requires 
high precision—each antenna must be located on the ground to a 
tolerance of about 25 microns (one-third of the width of a human 
hair). One of ALMA’s spectacular images is of the protoplanetary 
disc system around the young star HL Tauri (Figure 20), showing 
planets forming in a disc. In other protoplanetary discs, ALMA 
has identified carbon-based molecules, such as methyl and 
hydrogen cyanide and the spectral signatures of complex organic 
molecules, the building blocks of life.Observational Astronomy

Very long baseline interferometry
The high angular resolution achievable with short-wavelength 
arrays like ALMA comes from distributing antennas over 
distances of tens of kilometres. It is possible to increase the 
resolving power of ground-based radio telescopes even further by 
extending baselines to hundreds of kilometres, across continents, 
and ultimately distances limited by the diameter of the Earth. But 
to do this the signals from the antennas must be correlated 
together accurately. By the late 1960s, the technique of Very Long 
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) was first demonstrated when 
radio dishes located thousands of kilometres apart were 
synchronized to create a telescope having an angular resolution of 
thousandths of an arcsecond. Since it is physically impossible to 
use cables or fibres to interconnect such far-flung antennas, the 
signals at each are recorded digitally, time stamped using atomic 
clocks, and correlated at a later time.
VLBI is used to observe bright sources on the finest angular scales, 
such as extragalactic radio sources and planetary surfaces. One of 
the great discoveries of VLBI, of the molecular water maser line in 
the AGN of galaxy M106 at a wavelength of 1.3cm, was made in 
1995 with the USA’s Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Because a 
maser emits over an extremely narrow range of frequencies, the 
velocities of water masers orbiting a supermassive black hole 
were measured by radio spectroscopy right into the centre of the 
galaxy. These clearly showed the Keplerian orbital rotation of 
the material from which it was possible to infer the presence of a 
40-million-solar-mass supermassive black hole.
The shadow of a black hole
In 2017, a 200-strong team of astronomers of the Event Horizon 
Telescope (EHT) used a network of eight telescopes from all over 
the world to make the first ever image of the shadow of a black Observational Astronomy
66
hole. Black holes are small, dark, and distant, properties that 
present major observational challenges. The technique focused on 
observing the shadow of a supermassive black hole in an AGN, 
silhouetted against the bright background of the accretion disc. In 
order to view the structure close to the event horizon, observations 
had to be made at a wavelength at which the plasma is 
transparent. This and the need for high angular resolution could 
both be satisfied by observing the black hole at a wavelength of 
1.3mm using an Earth-sized VLBI telescope. The millimetre-wave 
observatories involved were: ALMA and the Atacama Pathfinder 
Experiment in Chile, the Spanish 30m Institute for Radio 
Astronomy in the Millimetre Range telescope, the Large 
Millimetre Telescope in Mexico, the Submillimetre Telescope in 
Arizona, the JCMT and the Submillimetre Array telescopes in 
Hawaii, and the South Pole Telescope in Antarctica. The 
supermassive black hole selected for observation is in the heart of 
the giant elliptical galaxy M87 and weighs 6 billion solar masses. 
To image it required a telescope with an angular resolution of 
0.000001 arcsecond. A telescope the size of the Earth was needed 
to see an object the size of an apple on the surface of the Moon.
The EHT image (Figure 21) shows a bright asymmetrical ring 
surrounding a dark centre. What are we actually seeing in this 
image? The ring of light is emitted by the hot million-degree 
plasma in the accretion disc which is swirling around the black 
hole at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light. The accretion 
disc does not reach all the way down to the event horizon because 
there are no stable circular orbits less than 3 Schwarzschild radii 
around a non-spinning black hole. Matter that crosses inside the 
last stable orbit falls into the black hole and disappears forever. 
Outside the event horizon of the black hole is a surface called the 
photon sphere, which has a radius of 1.5 Schwarzschild radii 
(Figure 22). Space is so strongly curved at the photon sphere that 
photons are able to follow closed orbits around the hole. An 
imaginary observer sitting on the photon sphere could look out 
along it and see the photons emitted from the back of her head! The radio Universe

68
The photon sphere separates the paths of photons that either 
spiral into the black hole (orbits a, b, and c), or escape (orbits 
d and e). Rays crossing the event horizon will disappear into the 
black hole. If a light ray approaches just above the horizon, it will 
be bent towards the black hole, cross the event horizon, and also 
disappear. Even a ray approaching at the radius of the photon 
sphere will suffer a similar fate. It turns out that for an incoming 
parallel ray to graze but not cross the event horizon, it must 
approach at more than 2.6 Schwarzschild radii; this is the radius 
of the shadow of the black hole.
The innermost region of the observed dark shadow in Figure 21 is 
the event horizon facing the observer, and the outer part of the 
shadow maps the back of the event horizon. This strange situation 
arises because of the very strong warping of space around the 
black hole which allows us to see both front and back surfaces in 
one image. Further out in the image, the light from the inner edge 
of the bright ring comes from rays that just graze the photon 
sphere and can escape to reach us. The accretion disc in M87 
happens to be orientated almost perpendicularly to our line of 
sight. The bright region at the bottom of the ring of light is 
relativistically beamed, indicating that the plasma on this side is 
approaching us.
To form this image, the EHT telescopes had to be synchronized 
precisely at each of the eight sites using hydrogen maser atomic 
clocks, accurate to within one second in ten million years. The 
enormous quantity of data generated by the telescopes (about 
350 terabytes a day) was stored on computer hard drives and 
brought physically together for correlation and processing. 
Reconstructing the image from the data was not straightforward. 
Unlike well-sampled synthesis radio telescope data, these VLBI 
measurements are sparse and it was not possible to obtain 
absolute phase calibration at each observatory. A sophisticated 
algorithm was developed to correlate the data, filter out noise and 
distorting atmospheric effects, and find the best-fitting image.The radio Universe
69
In 2022, the EHT released a second image of the shadow of the 
supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way, close to 
the bright radio source Sgr A*. This image is broadly similar to the 
one in M87. However, this observation proved to be more 
challenging to make because even though Sgr A* is closer to us, 
its mass is 1,000 times smaller, it is currently not accreting much 
matter (making it less luminous), and the line of sight to it 
passes through the Milky Way’s interstellar medium which tends 
to scatter the radio waves. Also, being a smaller black hole, the 
hot gas swirling around it at relativistic speeds resulted in 
significant signal fluctuations during the 8–10 hours 
observation time.
The Square Kilometre Array
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a radio telescope with a 
collecting area of literally 1 square kilometre (i.e. 1 million square 
metres), which will be composed of thousands of radio dishes 
spread across two continents, from the Karoo region of South 
Africa to the Murchison region of Western Australia. It will also 
have up to a million low frequency antennas. Thirty years in the 
making, the SKA will be the world’s largest scientific instrument, 
expanding the sensitivity, resolution, and spectral coverage of 
existing radio telescopes by over an order of magnitude and one 
that will transform our view of the Universe. The wavelength 
coverage is wide: from 1cm to 4m. The project is proceeding in 
steps with the first precursor arrays seeing first light in 2024. One 
of the first, the 64-dish Southern African MeerKAT array spread 
over 8km, is already producing striking data showing jets from 
stellar mass and supermassive black holes. MeerKAT has surveyed 
a 6.5-square-degree region around the supermassive black hole in 
the Milky Way, Sgr A* (Figure 23). This image reveals the galactic 
centre to be a complex and chaotic region, with many supernova 
remnants, clusters of young, massive stars, a high density of 
cosmic rays, and a tangled web of around 1,000 wispy radio 
filaments projecting away from the centre of the galaxy. The image Observational Astronomy
70
shows evidence that an explosive event has taken place in the 
region around Sgr A* a few million years ago.
This chapter has discussed how, by observing in the radio and 
far-infrared wavebands, we have discovered completely new facets 
of the Universe. Next, we look at how the rest of the 
electromagnetic spectrum is opening up by making observations 
from space.

Telescopes in space
Space telescopes are needed to observe the large swathes of the 
electromagnetic spectrum which are absorbed by the atmosphere 
and cannot reach the ground. These are the mid- and far-infrared, 
gamma ray, X-ray, and UV wavelengths. By opening up the wider 
electromagnetic spectrum, we are discovering a Universe teeming 
with high-energy activity revealing gamma-ray bursts, X-rays 
from hot gas in clusters of galaxies, the accretion discs around 
black holes, and UV from massive young stars. Space telescopes 
show us starburst galaxies shrouded in thick dust cocoons, 
complex star-forming regions, and extrasolar planets and their 
atmospheres. We are now seeing the youngest and most distant 
galaxies that have ever been observed.
Optical and infrared space telescopes
In addition to observing radiation which cannot reach the ground, 
space telescopes also offer advantages at visible wavelengths. 
Space telescope images are free of both the turbulent distortions 
imparted by Earth’s atmosphere (enabling sharp diffraction￾limited images to be made), and of the auroral light and airglow 
emission that limit the sensitivities of ground-based telescopes. 
These advantages extend to the infrared waveband, where thermal 
heat radiation from the body of the atmosphere itself becomes a 
limiting factor. In space, infrared telescopes are cooled to avoid Observational Astronomy
72
the sensors being swamped by thermal noise. For this, some 
telescopes carry reservoirs of cryogens such as liquid helium to 
cool detectors to a few degrees above absolute zero to observe at 
the longest wavelengths. Carrying a finite supply of coolant, 
however, limits mission lifetimes. The James Webb Space 
Telescope employs a passive sunshield to block out the Sun’s heat, 
and a cryocooler (a type of low-temperature refrigerator) to cool 
detectors.
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST; or ‘Hubble’) was the world’s 
first optical space telescope. The National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA), in partnership with the European Space 
Agency (ESA), launched the 2.4m HST from the Space Shuttle 
Discovery in 1990 into a low (570km) Earth orbit, where it 
operates in the near-infrared to the near-ultraviolet wavebands 
and can produce sharp diffraction-limited (0.05-arcsecond 
resolution) images. Hubble is famous for its breathtaking images 
of objects such as the star-forming region the ‘Pillars of Creation’ 
in the Eagle Nebula (Figure 24). These towering shapes of 
interstellar gas and dust have been etched into fantastic forms by 
the harsh ultraviolet light and fierce stellar winds from hot 
young stars. This is only one of the many well-known and 
ground-breaking observations made by Hubble; there are many 
others which include the surfaces of planets, the protoplanetary 
discs in star-forming regions which are ejecting jets of material, 
exoplanets, AGN, the optical counterparts of gamma-ray bursts 
and supernovae, and measurements of the cosmic web of dark 
matter and energy.
The HST’s first role, however, was to measure the Hubble constant 
H0 with much higher precision than had been done before. H0 is a 
fundamental cosmological parameter which measures the local 
expansion rate of the Universe, and determining this important 
constant depends on making precise astronomical distance 
measurements. Edwin Hubble’s original discovery of the Telescopes in space
73
expansion of the Universe came about because he could detect the 
‘standard candles’ of Cepheid variable stars in galaxies a few 
million light years away which allowed him to estimate their 
distances. However, his value for H0 turned out to be too large. 
The 200-inch Hale telescope was later used to refine the 
measurement, reducing the uncertainties in H0 to around 
50 per cent. Hubble’s high sensitivity and resolution, however, 
enabled it to detect Cepheid variable stars in galaxies hundreds 
of millions of light years away and, by extending the cosmic 
distance ladder to these greater distances, has reduced the 
24. Hubble Space Telescope image of the ‘Pillars of Creation’, a 
star-forming region in the Eagle Nebula in the Milky Way.Observational Astronomy
74
uncertainties in determining the Hubble constant to within 
10 percentage points.
In 2022, the HST discovered the most ancient and distant star so 
far seen (WHL0137-LS; or more poetically, Earendel, meaning 
‘morning star’, named after J. R. R. Tolkien’s mythical Middle￾Earth star-carrying mariner). The light from Earendel was 
emitted only 900 million years after the Big Bang (7 per cent of 
the age of the Universe) and it was only detected by a chance 
alignment with an intervening cluster of galaxies which, through 
the action of gravitational lensing, has greatly magnified its light. 
The star has a high luminosity and is believed to have a mass of at 
least 50 solar masses.
One of the Hubble’s most remarkable images is the Ultra Deep 
Field. It was made by pointing the telescope at a tiny, apparently 
empty area of sky, equivalent to the area covered by a sand grain 
held at arm’s length (3 arcminutes across), within which the light 
was integrated for a total exposure of 11 hours. It is the deepest 
visible-light image we have of the Universe, a 2D projection of a 
slab of spacetime, stretching back 12 billion years, and collapsed 
into a single frame. Far from being empty, the tiny patch of sky 
contains around 10,000 faint galaxies. It showed that the 
youngest, most distant galaxies have different morphologies from 
those in the local regions of the Universe. These irregularly shaped 
galaxies appear to be merging and combining. The very youngest 
appear as dots a few pixels across, or smudges of coloured light, 
the embryonic nuclei of what would later become fully fledged 
galaxies. By counting the number of galaxies in the deep field and 
extrapolating it to the whole sky, it has been estimated that there 
are around 100 billion galaxies in the observable Universe. 
However, the problem with observing such distant stars and 
galaxies at visible wavelengths is that their light has been strongly 
redshifted to the infrared by the expansion of the Universe, and 
they start to disappear from view. In effect, the HST runs out of 
vision for these most distant objects.Telescopes in space
75
The James Webb Space Telescope
Hubble’s successor, the infrared James Webb Space Telescope 
(JWST; or simply ‘Webb’), was launched from French Guiana on 
an Ariane 5 rocket on Christmas Day 2021. Squeezing the world’s 
largest space telescope (6.5m aperture) inside the 5.4m-diameter 
nosecone of the launch vehicle proved to be a highly challenging 
and fortunately ultimately highly successful feat of engineering. 
Having been folded up like origami to fit in the nosecone, the 
telescope could only be finally assembled once in space. Unlike 
Hubble’s low Earth orbit, which had made the telescope accessible 
to space shuttle repair missions, the remote and complex assembly 
of the Webb telescope had to proceed flawlessly. The most 
nerve-wracking part was unfurling the complex heat shield the 
size of a tennis court, emerging like the wings of a butterfly from a 
chrysalis. At Webb’s heart is its gold-plated mirror, composed of 
18 hexagonal gold-plated segments. At infrared wavelengths, a 
gold mirror is an efficient reflector. In this complex assembly 
process, there was no room for error; once in deep space there is 
no prospect of any repair missions. Webb is 1.6 million km from 
the Earth, four times the distance of the Moon, at the Sun–Earth 
second Lagrangian point (L2). L2 is a ‘sweet spot’ in space where 
the combined gravitational forces of the Earth and Sun are 
balanced by the centrifugal force of the spacecraft. There, Webb 
sweeps round the Sun, along the projected Sun–Earth line. Being 
in an L2 orbit is particularly advantageous for an infrared 
telescope operating at temperatures close to absolute zero because 
the environment there is much more stable than in a low Earth 
orbit where, moving periodically in and out of the Earth’s shadow, 
it would be subject to large fluctuating temperature gradients.
The first Webb results, released in mid-2022, included a 
remarkable deep field image of the region around a cluster of 
galaxies (SMACS 0723; Figure 25). This image is a composite 
made at different wavelengths between 0.6 and 5 microns with Observational Astronomy
76
Webb’s main imaging camera, NIRCam, with an exposure of 
12.5 hours. It shows a tiny area of the sky, the infrared 
equivalent to that of Hubble’s Ultra Deep Field. In the 
background there are extremely clear images of thousands of 
the faintest and most distant (and therefore oldest) galaxies that 
have ever been observed in the infrared. (The image contains a 
few nearby stars, the objects producing the sharp diffraction 
spikes.)
25. The James Webb space telescope’s First Deep Field infrared image. 
It is a slice through spacetime, seeing galaxies as far back in time as 
only 300 million years after the Big Bang. Almost all the objects in the 
field are galaxies, including the faint smudges of light. In the centre of 
the image, the gravitational lens of an intervening galaxy cluster warps 
the light from the background galaxies into prominent arcs.Telescopes in space
77
The light from the oldest galaxy seen here was emitted 13.5 billion 
years ago when the Universe was just 300 million years old. The 
frame of the image is centred on an intervening galaxy cluster 
4.6 billion light years away which, acting as a gravitational lens, 
has magnified the images of the much more distant galaxies. 
The prominent arc-shaped distortions of the galaxy shapes in this 
image result from the powerful gravitational lensing effect of the 
cluster, similar to the familiar light bending and warping effect of 
a magnifying glass. The magnified images show details within the 
ancient galaxies such as individual star clusters. Webb is also 
equipped with a Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) which is cooled 
below 7K using a cryocooler enabling it to operate in the 
5–28-micron waveband. Images made at these longer wavelengths 
highlight the thermal radiation from hot dust in galaxies, which is 
associated with regions of star formation. By comparing Webb’s 
observations in the two wavebands, it will be possible to study the 
evolution of star formation in galaxies at these very early times.
Other notable early JWST results include an infrared version of 
the ‘Pillars of Creation’ image (shown optically in Figure 24). At 
longer wavelengths the obscuring columns of dust and gas clouds 
become semi-transparent allowing Webb to see deeply into the 
heart of the nebula. This reveals myriads of hitherto unobserved 
young and still-forming stars. These young stars, no more than a 
few hundred thousand years old, periodically eject supersonic jets 
which blast into the surrounding gas to form bow shocks similar 
to the wake of a speedboat. Closer to home, Webb has made crisp 
images of the planets, including Jupiter showing its stormy 
surface, auroras, and faint ring, as well as the ice-giant planet 
Neptune, showing its surface features and remarkable multiple 
ring system.
Webb is the latest in a series of infrared space telescopes. The first 
mid- and far-infrared survey satellite was the InfraRed 
Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), dating from 1983. In a remarkable 
series of observations, IRAS discovered 350,000 infrared-emitting Observational Astronomy
78
galaxies, many of them starburst types, and a hitherto unknown 
class of Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies. Starburst galaxies 
undergo brief episodes of intense star formation, during which 
stars are formed at a rate much faster than is currently taking 
place in more quiescent galaxies like the Milky Way. Owing to the 
expansion of the Universe, the density of galaxies was once higher, 
and in the past galaxy–galaxy interactions and mergers were more 
frequent. Starburst galaxies are believed to arise from such galactic 
collisions, which can trigger the collapse of marginally stable 
interstellar clouds, initiating star formation. The strong stellar winds 
and UV light from the hot young stars blow dust out into space 
where it scatters and reradiates the light in the infrared. It is believed 
that the gravitational tidal interactions associated with galaxy 
mergers can drive fresh material deep down into the gravitational 
well of a supermassive black hole, triggering AGN behaviour.
In Webb’s image of Stefan’s Quintet (Figure 26), a group of 
interacting galaxies 300 million light years away, there is clear 
evidence of gravitational tidal interactions and mergers which are 
associated with starburst and AGN activity. The image shows 
galactic bridges and tails of stars and gas being pulled out from 
the galaxies by the tidal forces. Bright star clusters, starburst 
regions, and shock waves are visible in the luminous gas clouds 
lying between the central pair of galaxies on the right-hand side of 
the image. (The galaxy on the left-hand side is a chance 
foreground galaxy in the line of sight). The uppermost galaxy in 
the group harbours a supermassive black hole, an AGN 
accreting matter.
NASA’s infrared Spitzer Space Telescope (‘Spitzer’) has been a 
mainstay of infrared observations such as observing the 
population of dust-shrouded starburst galaxies, from an epoch of 
the Universe called the cosmic high-noon. This was when the star 
formation rate in galaxies peaked, about 2–3 billion years after the 
Big Bang. Spitzer has also played a role in exoplanet research. In 
2000, the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope Telescopes in space
79
(TRAPPIST) in Chile discovered a pair of exoplanets orbiting a 
nearby red dwarf star, TRAPPIST-1, only 39 light years from the 
Sun. Spitzer was used to observe this cool star and found five more 
exoplanets. The sizes of the TRAPPIST planets have been 
measured by transit dimming to be Earth-like and one lies in the 
habitable zone of the star, where conditions are suitable for liquid 
water to exist on the planetary surface. By observing small 
variations in the timings of their transits, astronomers have been 
able to infer the masses of the TRAPPIST-1 planets which shows 
that these are rocky worlds. In another exoplanetary system, 
Spitzer was the first telescope to image directly the heat of a hot 
Jupiter, as well as discovering a previously unobserved ring 
around Saturn.

Mapping stars
On a clear moonless night, several thousand stars are visible to the 
naked eye. Astronomers have been making maps of the stars for 
centuries. Just as maps help us find our way around the Earth by 
pointing out useful landmarks, star charts help us find our way 
around the sky.
Mapping stars is part of the field of astrometry. Modern 
astrometry is concerned not only with the position and brightness 
of stars, but also with their kinematics and composition. The 
distribution of stars in space is described by six parameters: three 
space and three velocity coordinates. The stars we see from Earth 
are projected on the 2D surface of the celestial sphere. This gives 
us two spatial coordinates. To fix the third, distance, requires 
stereoscopic vision, or parallax. The smallest measurable parallax 
angles achievable with ground-based observations are around ten 
milliarcseconds but it is possible to improve this precision with 
space telescopes. The first dedicated astrometry satellite, 
Hipparcos, was launched in 1989. It used twin telescopes to 
measure parallaxes as small as one milliarcsecond which yielded 
accurate distances of 120,000 stars out to several hundred light 
years. The motions of stars projected on the celestial sphere are 
proper motions, the angular changes in a star’s position with 
respect to the distant stellar background. Stellar proper 
motions therefore complement spectroscopic radial velocity 
measurements. When the proper motion, the radial velocity, and
the distance to a star are all known, its position and 3D velocity in 
space can be found.
Gaia—surveying two billion stars
ESA’s Gaia optical space telescope was launched in December 
2013 and is currently making the most detailed multi-dimensional 
observations ever made of the position, distance, and movements Telescopes in space
81
of stars in the Milky Way. Like Hipparcos, Gaia’s twin telescopes 
scan different parts of the sky, as the spacecraft slowly spins at its 
extremely dark Lagrangian L2 orbit, where it observes each star 
many times to pinpoint accurately its position and velocity. At 
Gaia’s heart is a 1-billion-pixel camera, consisting of a mosaic 
array of CCDs generating an enormous amount of data. 
Transmitting all the raw data back to Earth would be prohibitively 
slow, so the important parameters such as stellar positions and 
magnitudes are extracted by on-board computers. The starlight is 
split into red and blue bands which allow the temperature, size, 
and chemical composition of individual stars to be inferred 
photometrically. The radial velocities of the brightest stars are 
measured with a high-resolution spectrometer. Even with data 
compression, the information transmitted back to Earth is 
equivalent to over ten DVDs worth per day.
Gaia’s third data set, released in 2022, is the largest catalogue of 
astronomical data ever produced, and contains exquisite 
information on two billion stars, giving their temperatures, 
masses, ages, compositions, and types. These include many binary 
and variable stars. Gaia is also able to detect ‘starquakes’ in 
massive stars yielding data informing on their internal dynamics, 
temperatures, densities, internal rotations, and compositions. A 
star is essentially a hot ball of plasma, in which the inward pull of 
gravity is balanced by the outward pressure, a force balance that 
maintains the hydrostatic equilibrium of the star, keeping it 
inflated at a more-or-less constant size during its lifetime. Many 
stars, the Sun included, experience stellar oscillations about this 
equilibrium and, like the various oscillatory modes of a beaten 
drum-skin, they exhibit many possible vibrational modes. When a 
star’s gas vibrates radially in and out, for example, it changes the 
luminosity of the star, making it ‘blink’ slightly. This motion has 
been observed in the Sun, where the almost imperceptibly small 
oscillations have informed on its internal structure. Just as 
seismology teaches us about the interior of the Earth, 
astroseismology informs us on the interior of stars. Different stars Observational Astronomy
82
exhibit a great diversity of amplitudes of these vibrations which is 
found to depend on their masses and evolutionary stage.
Gaia’s data also enable 3D maps to be drawn of the positions and 
motions of vast numbers of stars, for example, the all-sky star map 
(Figure 27), showing the trails of stars in the solar neighbourhood 
projected 400,000 years into the future.
Gaia’s data have also been used to project the positions of stars 
backwards in time. This has revealed the ancient history of our 
galaxy, and has shown evidence of past acts of galactic 
cannibalism. Galaxy–galaxy gravitational tidal interactions, such 
as that taking place in the Webb image (Figrue 26), produce gas 
and dust streamers bridging vast distances of intergalactic space. 
These and numerous other observations support the view that big 
galaxies get even bigger by eating up (or merging with) smaller 
ones. When a small galaxy (the victim) is consumed by a big 
galaxy (the perpetrator), the victim’s stars will, over time, be 
assimilated and comingle with those of the perpetrator. Such acts 
of galactic cannibalism do not simply get obliterated from the 
history books; they leave traces of forensic evidence. For example, 
27. Gaia satellite’s all-sky map of the trails of stars out to a distance of 
300 light years, projected 400,000 years into the future. The plane 
of the Milky Way lies horizontally in the centre.Telescopes in space
83
the victim’s stars may be of a different age or composition to those 
of the perpetrator. So even if the stars become merged spatially in 
the final fattened-up galaxy, they can still be identified 
spectroscopically. If the victim merged, say, with a perpetrator on 
a counter-rotating orbit, a memory remains in the kinematic 
velocities of the stars. In Gaia’s maps, astronomers have found 
evidence that around ten billion years ago, a dwarf galaxy known 
as Gaia-Enceladus punched its way into the Galactic disc, sending 
out gravitational ripples as the victim oscillated above and below 
it a few times before finally being pulled in by the overwhelmingly 
strong gravity of the Milky Way. Spectroscopic observations have 
revealed the existence of a special group of counter-rotating stars 
in the Milky Way’s halo whose spectra have a different mix of 
chemical elements compared with their neighbours, evidence 
pointing to an ancient external galaxy collision.
Hunting for exoplanets
In 2009 NASA launched Kepler, a space mission designed to 
search for exoplanets. Kepler focused on exoplanets in the 
‘habitable zones’ of their stars, where liquid water may exist, 
making them potentially suitable for the development of life. 
Kepler used the transit method, one that has turned out to be a 
productive way of discovering new worlds. To date, over 5,300 
exoplanets have been discovered, of which over half were 
discovered by Kepler. Although the Kepler mission has now 
ended, computer algorithms and the Planet Hunters citizen 
science projects continue to sift through Kepler’s data for evidence 
of planetary transits, filtering out many types of false positives. 
Once evidence for genuine exoplanets is found, these data are 
analysed to extract parameters such as the orbital and planetary 
radii, and the possible presence of multiple planets.
The first all-sky exoplanet transit telescope, NASA’s Transiting 
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), was launched in 2018. It 
carries four wide-field telescopes, and is able to survey an area of Observational Astronomy
84
sky 350 times larger than that viewed by Kepler. Its purpose is to 
identify a large sample of small planets which are suitable for 
follow-up observations; to date TESS has found over 6,000 
candidate exoplanets, of which almost 300 have been confirmed 
as new at the time of writing. The criteria used in confirming a 
candidate exoplanet are stringent. These include observing 
multiple regular dips in a star’s brightness, cross-checks with 
other telescopes, possibly at other wavelengths and with different 
techniques such as the radial velocity method, ruling out artefacts 
in the data or extraneous causes such as changes to a star’s 
brightness caused by the movements of starspots or orbiting 
non-planetary bodies such as brown dwarfs, asteroids, or 
dust clouds.
The Webb telescope has a Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless 
Spectrograph (NIRISS) infrared spectrometer which was used in 
2022 to measure the most detailed spectrum of the atmosphere of 
an exoplanet (WASP-96b) ever made. The planet was observed in 
transit across the face of a Sun-like star, some 1,150 light years 
from us, and is a hot Jupiter orbiting close to its star. Webb 
measured the spectrum of light transmitted through the exoplanet’s 
atmosphere. The range of wavelengths studied (0.6–2.8 microns) 
brackets the spectral lines of water molecules, and the results 
showed clear evidence of water. The temperature on WASP-96b is 
in excess of 500°C, so the water must be in the form of steam. Webb 
also found evidence of haze and clouds on this planet.
Exoplanet research is an extremely active area, new results pour in 
from telescopes on the ground and in space. The thousands of 
exoplanets now confirmed show a highly diverse zoology. Masses 
range from less than 0.1 Earth masses for rocky worlds, to 10,000 
Earth masses for hot Jupiters orbiting close to their parent stars, 
tidally locked and blasted by supersonic planet-wide winds, as 
well as cold gas giants orbiting further out. The orbital periods 
vary from as short as eight hours for hot molten lava planets, to 
over 100 years for the gas giants.Telescopes in space
85
Ultraviolet observations
The wavelengths of ultraviolet light are longer than the spacing of 
atoms in solids, which means that UV can be reflected by finely 
polished mirrors. Hubble’s mirror was polished to within 3nm for 
this purpose. Ultraviolet photons are emitted by objects with 
temperatures up to 100,000°, which include massive young stars, 
the accretion discs around gravitationally collapsed objects, AGN, 
and supernovae. Many chemical elements have atomic resonance 
lines in the UV, and observations of these inform on the chemistry 
of the interstellar medium.
In the 1960s NASA launched three Orbiting Astronomical 
Observatories (OAO) satellites. Of these, the Copernicus (OAO-3)
observatory carried a high-resolution UV spectrometer and 
measured the spectra of many hot stars. The first space 
observatory to be operated remotely was the International 
Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) of 1978 and has observed young hot 
stars, their stellar winds, hot white dwarf stars, and many active 
galactic nuclei. A large UV sky survey conducted in 2003 by 
NASA’s Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) telescope, catalogued 
several hundred million sources including hot young stars in 
galaxies, which have improved our understanding of stellar 
evolution and nucleosynthesis.
The X-ray Universe
The first observations of cosmic X-rays were made from captured 
German ex-World War II V2 rockets and from balloons. Other 
suborbital rockets carried ionization chamber detectors above the 
atmosphere to observe the X-ray sky for a few minutes. An X-ray 
detection involves an incoming photon passing through a 
gas-filled chamber, ionizing the gas, and creating a wake of ions 
and electrons in the gas. This is recorded as an electrical pulse. 
Early observations of this type targeted the Sun, but our star was Observational Astronomy
86
found to be only a weak source of X-rays. However, in 1962 an 
Aerobee rocket flight detected the first really bright X-ray source, 
Scorpius X-1 (Sco-X-1), an extraordinary object a billion times 
more luminous than the Sun in X-rays (or 10,000 times the 
overall luminosity of the Sun). This observation was highly 
influential in starting X-ray astronomy, a field that has now 
shown us that the Universe is teeming with extraordinary 
X-ray-emitting objects such as X-ray binary (XRB) sources 
containing compact objects such as black holes, neutron stars, 
supernova remnants, galaxies, quasars, and the vast 
atmospheres of hot gas bound in clusters of galaxies. Very hot 
objects with temperatures from a million to a billion degrees 
radiate X-ray photons with energies between 100 eV and 
100 kilo electron volt (keV).
In 1970 the first X-ray survey satellite, Uhuru (meaning ‘freedom’ 
in Swahili), was launched from a site in Kenya. Uhuru’s catalogue 
contains a large number of XRBs, the brightest type of X-ray 
sources in the Milky Way. An XRB consists of a compact object 
(white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole) and a normal star 
orbiting around their common centre of mass (Figure 28). A star 
in a binary system is bounded by a teardrop-shaped surface called 
the Roche lobe, shown distorting the envelope of the star to the 
right of Figure 28. The Roche lobe defines the region within which 
the stellar gas is gravitationally bound to the star. If the gas 
extends outside of the star’s Roche lobe, it can be captured by the 
compact object. In an XRB, matter is stripped from the normal 
star (the donor) and transferred to the compact object via the 
intermediary of a hot X-ray-emitting accretion disc. The disc 
radiates an enormous amount of energy (several tens of percent of 
the rest mass energy of the matter). When the XRB also has jets 
and is a radio source, it is known as a a microquasar, essentially a 
miniature version of an AGN. One of the brightest XRBs in the 
sky is Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1), the first black hole ever identified, 
which is believed to weigh around 15 solar masses. Cyg X-1 is 
orbiting a bright blue supergiant star (HDE226868) with a Telescopes in space
87
5.6-day period. The X-ray intensity is observed to vary rapidly on 
timescales of about a millisecond, implying that its emitting 
region is smaller than 300km across.
One of Uhuru’s most important discoveries was of the X-ray 
emission from hot gas in clusters of galaxies. Clusters of galaxies 
are some of the largest gravitationally bound entities in the 
Universe. The Coma cluster, for example, has a diameter of 
20 million light years and contains roughly 1,000, mostly 
elliptical, galaxies. This cluster had been studied in 1937 by Fritz 
Zwicky. His spectroscopic measurements showed that the galaxies 
are moving around too quickly for the Coma cluster to be stable if 
the only mass present was the visible mass in galaxies. Zwicky 
concluded that there must be a large amount of extra, unseen 
mass present to provide enough gravity to prevent the galaxies 
from flying apart, and he named this missing mass ‘dunkle 
materie’ (or dark matter). However, dark matter must be of a

fundamentally different nature to the baryonic mass in protons 
and neutrons (baryons) of so-called normal matter, because it 
does not emit, absorb, or reflect light.
Zwicky’s dynamical argument was based on his spectroscopic 
observations of the high velocities of galaxies in the cluster. 
However, a different method of determining the total gravitational 
mass in clusters of galaxies comes from X-ray observations. Large 
clusters of galaxies are permeated by a million-degree-hot 
intracluster medium consisting mainly of ionized hydrogen and 
helium. High temperature plasmas emit X-rays as bremsstrahlung
(braking) radiation which is produced by the sudden deflections of 
fast-moving plasma electrons encountering the strong electric 
fields of the plasma ions. The gas in a cluster of galaxies is in a 
state of hydrostatic equilibrium resulting from a force balance: 
gravity pulling the gas inwards, and thermal pressure pushing it 
outwards, as it is in a star. So by balancing the forces, the 
gravitational potential of the cluster and its total gravitational 
mass can be inferred from a knowledge of the gas density and 
pressure, both of which come from X-ray observations. The results 
showed that large clusters of galaxies weigh roughly ten times 
more than can be accounted for by the amount of visible matter 
they contain. In other words, around 90 per cent of the cluster 
mass is not normal baryonic matter, but dark matter.
X-ray telescopes
The first X-ray images were crude and made at low resolution 
using collimators placed in front of ionization detectors. The first 
focusing X-ray telescope (XRT) was a grazing-incidence design by 
German physicist Hans Wolter (Figure 29(a)). While energetic 
X-ray photons penetrate different materials to varying degrees, 
they can bounce off ultra-smooth metal surfaces at grazing 
incidence, like stones skipped across a smooth lake. For this, the 
surface has to be atomically smooth since any bumps, even a few 
atoms high, will scatter X-rays and spoil the image. The aperture Telescopes in space

mirrors, nested like Russian dolls. In 1999, NASA launched the

more sensitive than the first rocket-borne detectors of the 1960s 
(Figure 29(b)). Chandra has the sharpest X-ray vision of any 
telescope so far flown, with its 1.23m aperture Wolter XRT 
achieving a resolution of 0.5 arcseconds.
Chandra has imaged the X-ray emission from the remarkable 
Bullet Cluster, two colliding clusters of galaxies. In this titanic 
collision, there are significant observational differences between 
the distributions of the intracluster gas (from X-ray observations), 
and the dark matter (inferred from gravitational lensing). 
When two clusters collide, their gas atmospheres interact via the 
electromagnetic force and are decelerated, forming shock waves. 
The kinetic energy of their motion is dissipated as heat in the gas 
which enhances the X-ray emission. Figure 30 shows Chandra’s 
observations of the intracluster gas component (in greyscale). Where 
the two gas components of each cluster have interpenetrated, a 
bullet-shaped bow shock wave has formed on the right-hand side of 
the image, reminiscent of the wake of a speedboat on water.

A contour map of the total gravitational mass distribution of the 
colliding clusters (inferred from gravitational lensing) is 
superimposed over the X-ray map. The two mass density peaks 
indicate the positions of the dark matter clumps. There is a spatial 
mismatch between the distributions of dark matter and the gas. 
In the collision of these two vast clusters of galaxies, the gas 
atmospheres appear to have been decelerated and are now lagging 
behind the clumps of dark matter which seem to have passed 
through themselves collisionlessly. The bullet cluster observations 
provide evidence that dark matter does not appreciably interact 
either with itself or with normal matter, except via gravity.
Gamma-ray astronomy
Gamma rays cover an enormous energy range, from 100keV to 
1020eV (ten million times higher in energy than has been achieved 
in the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, the Large 
Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear 
Research (or CERN)). Such energetic photons cannot be focused 
by the familiar reflecting mirrors or refracting lenses in a normal 
telescope—they simply pass through solid materials as if they are 
bullets fired through tissue paper. Instead, astronomers study 
gamma-ray interactions with matter in detectors that would not 
be out of place in a high-energy physics laboratory.
Three ways that high-energy photons interact with matter are 
through the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and pair 
production. The photoelectric effect is used to detect lower energy 
photons, as in a CCD detector. For medium energies, up to 
30 million electron volt (MeV), Compton scattering predominates. 
The American physicist Arthur Compton discovered that 
high-energy photons behave like billiard balls so that when they 
collide with electrons energy is shared out between them. This 
property is used to detect gamma rays and forms the basis of 
Compton gamma-ray scintillators, materials which absorb the 
energy of ionizing radiation and convert it into visible photons. Observational Astronomy
92
In a two-stage scintillator, a photon is first scattered to lower 
energies and then absorbed in a second scintillator to produce a 
photoelectron. At the highest photon energies, interactions with 
matter are dominated by pair-production events. When a gamma 
ray grazes past an atomic nucleus, the nuclear electric field causes 
it to transform into a pair of particles: an electron and a positron. 
A positron is an antimatter particle, a positively charged electron. 
The pair travels on through the detector, leaving a tell-tale trail of 
tracks. For this process to occur, the photon energy must exceed 
1.02MeV, twice the rest mass energy of the electron. The electron 
and positron subsequently annihilate to produce two gamma rays 
which can either Compton scatter or be absorbed 
photoelectrically.
NASA’s Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO), active 
between 1991 and 2000, was the first large space observatory to 
carry a variety of X- and gamma-ray detectors including a 
gamma-ray spectrometer to measure the nuclear spectral 
lines up to 10MeV produced by radioactive decay and so 
identify chemical nuclei. CGRO also carried a pair-production 
gamma-ray telescope, a spark chamber. This is a gas-filled 
chamber containing an array of electrically charged metal plates 
which show up the tracks of pair-production particles. The 
direction of an incoming photon is deduced from back-projecting 
the tracks.
Other gamma-ray sources include the acceleration of cosmic rays 
ploughing into the interstellar medium of a galaxy, or sites of the 
acceleration of particles in the shock fronts around supernovae 
explosions. Gammas are also produced in the fleeting billion-degree 
temperatures inside supernovae explosions, by matter–antimatter 
annihilations, and by the process of inverse Compton scattering. 
In this, low-energy photons receive a large energy boost when they 
collide with very hot electrons, converting them into gamma rays. 
Such conditions are expected in the relativistic jets of AGN.Telescopes in space
93
The most detailed images of the gamma-ray Universe have come 
from NASA’s Fermi Space Telescope (Fermi) of 2008, named after 
the Italian nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi. Fermi can image 
gamma rays with energies up to 300 giga electron volt (GeV) with 
an angular resolution of 0.1°, using its 20° field-of-view pair￾conversion Large Area Telescope. Fermi’s gamma-ray survey has 
resulted in a catalogue of some 5,000 objects identified as blazars, 
pulsars, and supernova remnants. There is a band of gamma-ray 
emission from the plane of the Milky Way, and a particularly 
bright source in the galactic centre near the supermassive black 
hole, Sgr A*. A significant number of Fermi’s sources are so far 
unidentified. One of the most striking discoveries was of two vast 
gamma-ray-emitting gas bubbles, located symmetrically on either 
side of the centre of the Milky Way, extending tens of thousands of 
light years from the galactic plane. These so-called ‘Fermi bubbles’ 
extend even further from the galactic plane than the MeerKAT 
radio-emitting filaments (Figure 23), and are thought to result 
from past explosions from the region near the central 
supermassive black hole.94
Chapter 5
The dynamic Universe
Gazing up at the star-studded sky on a clear dark night, it is easy 
to think of the heavens as being static. The only barely discernible 
motion is the gentle wheeling of the constellations on the celestial 
sphere, against which the Moon and planets slowly weave their 
wandering courses. The stars are changing, but imperceptibly so 
on human timescales. Stars and galaxies evolve on timescales 
measured in millions or billions of years. Occasionally a star might 
suddenly flare up as a nova (visible at a rate of about one per 
decade) or explode as a supernova (seen about once a century). 
Once thought to be rare events, modern time-domain astronomy
has shown us the opposite. Every second a supernova explodes 
somewhere in the Universe. Things can and do change rapidly, 
often quite suddenly and without warning.
Astronomers search the sky for objects that move or suddenly 
change brightness. The objects that flare up on timescales of 
milliseconds are the supernovae, variable X-ray sources, 
magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, active galactic 
nuclei, and tidal disruption events. Rapidly varying objects are 
supermassive black holes and the stellar corpses of white dwarfs, 
neutron stars, and black holes. However, the problem with 
observing any transient event lies in catching it. For example, 
during a meteor shower, a ‘shooting star’ can appear at any 
moment, anywhere in the sky. To catch sight of one, a good The dynamic Universe
95
strategy is simply to rely on the wide field of the naked eye. For the 
same reason, wide-field telescopes are the most effective for this 
type of observation.
A global system dedicated to catching transients is NASA’s 
Catalina Real Time Transient Survey, an observing network based 
on three telescopes with apertures no bigger than 1.5m, located in 
the USA and Australia. Catalina has discovered thousands of 
optical transients, mostly AGN with supermassive black holes, 
supernovae, cataclysmic variables (accreting binary stars that emit 
sporadic outbursts), as well as many asteroids and Near-Earth 
Objects (NEO). (An NEO is defined as an object coming within 
1.3AU of the Sun.) Another dedicated telescope is the Zwicky 
Transient Facility (ZTF) at Palomar Observatory. The ZTF 
telescope is the venerable and now robotic Samuel Oschin 
Schmidt camera, which was refurbished in 2017 with a cooled 
CCD camera, 100 times more sensitive than the original 
photographic plates it once used. ZTF can image 47 square 
degrees of sky at a time, equivalent to around 250 full Moons, and 
can survey the entire northern sky in two nights. The telescope is 
currently detecting over 10,000 explosive transients a year and 
creating a torrent of data including hundreds of thousands of 
nightly alerts. Most of these are false and, to filter them out and 
find the ‘needles in the haystack’, the rapidly growing field of 
machine learning is being developed to classify the genuine events 
as supernovae, asteroids, and objects that can be followed up 
spectroscopically.
Transients are discovered by scanning an area of the sky, storing the 
digital image, moving to another field, and then returning to repeat 
the first scan. Any changes are revealed by subtracting successive 
images of the same region. When a ‘target of interest’ is identified, 
its coordinates are sent to telescope networks, for further 
observation. The most important information about a transient 
comes during the earliest stages, and it is vital to capture data from 
such an object as quickly as possible, before it fades from view.Observational Astronomy

Supernovae
On 23 February 1987, a supernova, SN1987A, exploded in our 
nearby galaxy companion, the Large Magellanic Cloud. It was the 
brightest since Kepler’s supernova of 1604, and it continues to be 
important because it has been studied in great detail for three 
decades using the whole panoply of modern telescopes and 
instruments, studies that have informed us on the final stages of 
stellar evolution. SN1987A was a Type II supernova which results 
from the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star 
weighing more than 8 solar masses. The explosion was near 
enough for astronomers to identify that the progenitor had been a 
20-solar-mass blue supergiant star which, afterwards, 
disappeared. The light curve of the expanding shell of debris took 
80 days to reach maximum brightness, and then remained at 
roughly constant luminosity for around two months. A hundred 
days after the explosion, spectroscopic observations showed that 
the light was dominated by the radioactive decay of nickel 56 to 
cobalt 56 to iron 56, a decay chain that gives off gamma rays. 
Being released in an expanding optically thick shell, the gamma 
rays were scattered in the material, reradiating the energy in the 
optical and infrared wavebands. The gammas, however, could not 
be observed until the shell had expanded and become transparent 
enough to allow them to escape. The supernova remnant stayed 
visible in UV, optical, and infrared wavebands for around 
three years.
A remarkable late image of SN1987A combines data at three 
wavelengths (Figure 31). It shows a sharply defined luminous ring 
of excited gas centred on the explosion, produced by the UV flash 
exciting atoms in the surrounding gas. Three overlapping rings of 
material have been observed that are believed to have been blown 
off during the star’s final years. The slower moving shock wave 
from the explosion eventually caught up with the luminous ring 
which, when they collided, heated the gas and enhanced the X-ray The dynamic Universe
97
luminosity. The remnant also emitted radio synchrotron emission, 
from electrons accelerated in the shock wave. Is there an 
associated neutron star? None was identified at first but, after 
many years of searching, astronomers using the ALMA telescope 
in 2019 believe that they have observed it at submillimetre 
wavelengths. The neutron star is thought to have been lying 
hitherto unseen, shrouded in dust.
These observations have enabled us to frame the main events 
leading to a core-collapse supernova. Towards the end of their 
lives, the outer layers of massive stars expand and they become red 
31. Three superimposed images of supernova 1987A showing the

supergiants. The high core temperatures in these stars take them 
past the carbon and oxygen burning stage, initiating a series of 
fusion reactions synthesizing higher mass elements in the periodic 
table such as neon and silicon in onion-skin-like shells 
surrounding an iron core. Fusion reactions are exothermic, namely 
they release energy. However, as the massive star produces 
increasingly heavy elements, it encounters a law of diminishing 
returns. The energy yield of fusion reactions drops, eventually 
becoming zero at iron. Thus, to make elements heavier than iron 
requires endothermic nuclear reactions which require a net energy 
input. Therefore, once the iron core has formed, fusion reactions 
in the centre cease.
At this point, events proceed rapidly. The iron core exceeds the 
critical Chandrasekhar mass and begins to collapse, releasing 
gravitational energy which causes the temperature to shoot up 
several billion degrees. The radiation trapped in the core is so 
energetic that the photons break up iron nuclei into alpha 
particles and neutrons (photodisintegration), a process that 
absorbs so much energy the central pressure falls precipitously, 
turning the contraction into a free-fall. As temperatures skyrocket, 
the helium nuclei split into protons and neutrons. The protons 
convert into neutrons via the weak nuclear interaction, releasing 
an enormous flux of neutrinos in forming the neutron star. The 
sudden onset of the neutron degeneracy pressure stabilizes the 
core, stopping the collapse dead in its tracks. Meanwhile, unaware 
of the now-stable core, the outer envelope of the star continues its 
headlong infall. On striking the core, the envelope rebounds 
violently, flinging a rich cocktail of elements into the interstellar 
medium at speeds of 10,000km per second and generating 
powerful shock waves in the gas. This is a nuclear explosion that is 
an octillion (1027) times more powerful than a hydrogen bomb.
In a Type Ia supernova, the progenitor is a carbon–oxygen white 
dwarf star accreting matter from its companion star in a close 
binary system, which takes it over the Chandrasekhar stability The dynamic Universe
99
limit. (Types Ib and Ic are different still and are believed to be 
variants of core-collapse types, where much of the stars’ outer 
envelopes have been stripped away.) When the matter from a 
companion star accretes onto the surface of the white dwarf, it is 
heated strongly, and undergoes a flaring thermonuclear burn, 
brightening up sporadically as a nova. In this way, the white 
dwarf ’s mass will steadily build up, increasing until it reaches the 
critical Chandrasekhar mass. At that point, the temperature rises, 
carbon is ignited, and the star collapses rapidly, triggering 
runaway thermonuclear reactions. In a few seconds the entire star 
unbinds and explodes as a supernova. Because the instability 
threshold occurs at a fixed mass, Type Ia supernovae reach 
consistent peak luminosities (about five billion times the 
luminosity of the Sun). This renders them visible over great 
cosmic distances, where they are used as the standard candles that 
underpin modern cosmology and enable us to assess the scale of 
the Universe.
Gamma-ray and X-ray transients
In the 1960s, the USA signed a test ban treaty with the USSR to 
eliminate atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. A nuclear air 
burst produces a large flux of gamma rays and, to monitor Soviet 
compliance with the treaty, the USA launched a number of Vela 
satellites carrying gamma-ray sensors. By timing the arrival of a 
gamma-ray pulse at different satellites, the position of the source 
can be pinpointed. The satellites did indeed detect bursts of 
intense gamma rays, however these came not from the Earth, but 
from the cosmos. The Vela results were declassified and published 
in 1973.
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the brightest events in the 
gamma-ray sky. They can appear at random anywhere in the sky 
about once a day, and can last anything between ten milliseconds 
and twenty minutes. The Compton survey showed GRBs to be 
uniformly distributed across the sky and therefore not especially Observational Astronomy
100
associated with the Milky Way. This meant that they could have 
come from either weak local sources or strong ones much farther 
away. There are two types: short bursters and long bursters, with a 
break point at around two seconds. The long bursters are thought 
to come from core-collapse supernovae forming either neutron 
stars or hypernovae (also known as collapsars, where the core 
collapses directly to a black hole). In 1997, four decades after 
GRBs were first observed, the fading afterglow of a long-burst 
event, GRB970508, was at last identified optically with a faint 
star-forming galaxy, allowing its distance to be measured. This 
was six billion light years, indicating that this and other GRBs 
release massive amounts of energy. On 9 October 2022, the 
‘Brightest Of All Time’ (BOAT; GRB221009A) was observed using 
both ground and space telescopes. The gamma-ray flash was so 
intense that it temporarily blinded several space detectors. BOAT 
was a long-burst GRB, associated with the explosion of a rare type 
of massive rapidly rotating star. Observations pinpointed the 
explosion to a galaxy about two billion light years away. A star in 
this galaxy is thought to have collapsed directly into a black hole, 
whilst simultaneously ejecting material into space as two opposite 
and narrow relativistic jets, one of which happened to point 
towards us. The flux of energetic photons arriving from the GRB 
was large enough to disturb perceptibly the Earth’s upper 
atmosphere, ionizing the gas, and modifying its radio propagation 
properties. This impact also produced very-low-frequency 
oscillating currents in the Earth’s crust, coupled via the 
Earth–ionosphere waveguide.
The short-burst GRBs are believed to have a different origin; there 
is evidence that these are produced by neutron star to neutron star 
mergers. This idea gained credence in 2017 when the LIGO-Virgo 
consortium observed the first multi-messenger gravitational wave/
electromagnetic wave merger (GW170817) which coincided with a 
short GRB seen by the Fermi gamma-ray satellite. This event was 
also seen by NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Swift, The dynamic Universe
101
launched in 2004, carries a Burst Alert Telescope to image GRBs, 
and observes about 100 a year with a coded aperture telescope. 
This type of telescope is a sensor array fronted by a lead mask 
which admits gamma rays through pinholes placed in a fixed 
random pattern. The recorded images are later analysed to 
reconstruct an image which locates the source. Swift also carries 
Wolter X-ray and UV/optical telescopes which can be slewed 
rapidly to observe the GRB afterglow, and can broadcast transient 
alerts to other telescopes. Swift has made many exciting 
discoveries, including that of the most distant GRB seen so far, 
13 billion light years away.
X-ray transients are associated with the transfer of mass from a 
star to a compact object in an X-ray binary (XRB), as shown in 
Figure 28. There are two varieties of XRBs: low- and high-mass 
types such as Cyg-X-1. Low-mass X-ray binary systems (LMXBs) 
have lightweight stellar companions, such as the half-solar-mass 
donor star which is the companion to the accreting neutron star 
and the brightest X-ray source in the sky, Sco-X-1 (its optical 
counterpart is a bright highly variable star, known as V818 Sco, 
but most of this light comes from the accretion disc around the 
neutron star). LMXBs do not pulsate regularly but produce a 
quasi-steady X-ray emission, varying on timescales of minutes to 
months, punctuated by sporadic and dramatic X-ray outbursts 
(so-called ‘X-ray bursts’) that rise within seconds and decay 
within minutes. This behaviour is explained by the accretion of 
hydrogen and helium onto the surface of the neutron star 
releasing energy and heating the gas to high temperatures. 
The hydrogen readily burns on the surface of the neutron star, 
increasing the X-ray emission, but a critical amount of helium 
has to accumulate before a thermonuclear ‘flash’ is triggered, 
which we observe as an X-ray burst. Pulsations are also seen. 
Matter falling onto a magnetized neutron star is funnelled 
towards the magnetic poles where it releases energy in X-ray 
emitting hot spots. As the star spins, these spots move in and out Observational Astronomy
102
of the observer’s line of sight and thus appear as regular 
pulsations in the X-ray signal.
Tidal disruption events
Isaac Newton’s universal law of gravitation states that the 
attractive gravitational force between two masses is proportional 
to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the 
square of their separation. Newton used the law to explain the 
ocean tides, caused by the gravitational influence of the Moon. In 
the open seas there are two tides a day. On the side of the Earth 
facing the Moon the water is nearest to the Moon and pulled 
towards it most. Being able to move, the water bulges out to make 
a tide. On the opposite side, being farther from the Moon, the 
water is pulled less strongly and so is ‘left behind’ by the Earth, 
bulging out to make the second tide. These relatively weak tidal 
forces move the water by no more than a few metres. But when 
the orbit of a star brings it close to a supermassive black hole, tidal 
forces can rip the whole star apart.
If a star wanders too close to a black hole, tidal forces deform the 
star’s facing surface strongly, causing it to bulge out towards the 
black hole, and elongating it into a cigar shape. Once the stellar 
material protrudes outside the Roche lobe, it can be captured by 
the black hole. The material then further elongates, eventually 
forming a filament winding around the hole. The filament 
fragments into separate pieces which fall into the hole producing 
a string of observable transient radio, optical, X-ray, and 
gamma-ray flares. This star-shredding process is a tidal 
disruption event, and many are seen in surveys. A classic nearby 
and small-scale example of this fragmentation process took place 
in 1992 when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 passed so close to 
Jupiter that the planet’s tidal forces tore it apart, forming a line 
of cometary pieces, all of which subsequently fell into the 
giant planet.The dynamic Universe
103
Magnetars
One of the most mysterious and terrifying objects in the Universe 
is a rare type of pulsar called a magnetar (magnetic star). 
Magnetars are the most highly magnetized objects known in the 
cosmos and generate powerful outbursts of X-rays and gamma 
rays. The details of how magnetars form are not understood but, 
like pulsars, they are thought to be produced in the collapsing 
cores of massive stars in supernovae. The enormous magnetic 
fields are likely to arise from a magnetic-line winding-up process, 
in which accretion from a companion is combined with rotation. 
A magnetar has a magnetic field strength of a quadrillion (1015) 
gauss. To put this in perspective, the Earth’s field is about 0.5 
gauss, a common refrigerator magnet has around 100 gauss, in a 
pulsar the field strength is 1 trillion gauss, but in a magnetar it is 
1,000 times stronger still. Near to a magnetar the field is so strong 
that it can distort matter by tearing molecules apart and 
stretching atoms into rod-like shapes called pencils. Even if you 
were 1,000km from a magnetar, its magnetic field would distort 
the atoms in your body.
Magnetars generate some of the strongest known 
electromagnetic transients. As is evidenced by the observed 
glitches in pulsar periods, the stresses in the neutron crust can 
build up, slip, and fracture, generating extremely powerful 
starquakes. Starquakes are analogous to the build up and 
release of stresses in Earth’s tectonic plates, which result in 
earthquakes. Magnetar starquakes are associated with powerful 
emissions of X-rays and gamma rays. One of the most powerful 
starquakes was detected from magnetar SGR1806-20, an 
object only about 12km across and 50,000 light years away, on 
the far side of the Milky Way. In a burst lasting only a tenth of a 
second, this starquake released more energy than the Sun does 
in 100,000 years. In 2013, a magnetar (PSR 1745-2900) was 
discovered orbiting less than a light year from the supermassive Observational Astronomy
104
black hole in the centre of the Milky Way, Sgr A*, producing 
transients at X-ray, gamma-ray, and radio wavelengths.
Fast radio bursts
The 64m radio telescope dish at Parkes Observatory in New South 
Wales, Australia, started operating in 1961 and over the years has 
discovered a record number of pulsars. It also picked up the first 
of a mysterious type of brief radio transient, a fast radio burst
(FRB). In 2007, radio astronomers Duncan Lorimer and David 
Narkevic had been reanalysing some six-year-old pulsar data 
when they came across a strange signal—an extremely bright 
millisecond-long single radio burst. The resolving power of the 
Parkes dish was not great enough to determine the position of 
what became known as the ‘Lorimer burst’ well enough for optical 
identification, but the signal had an incriminating fingerprint—an 
unusually large dispersion measure.
Two key observables of a pulsar are its pulse period and dispersion 
measure. Pulsars emit sharp pulses which, on their journey 
through the interstellar medium, are smeared out in time so that 
the low-frequency waves in the pulse lag behind the higher 
frequency ones and arrive later. Pulse dispersion is caused by the 
interaction of the wave with electrons in the interstellar medium, 
slowing it down. The observed pulse broadening, the dispersion 
measure, relates directly to the number of electrons the ray has 
encountered along its path. With a knowledge of the electron 
density in the galaxy, pulsar dispersion measures can therefore be 
used to infer the distances of pulsars.
What was unusual about the Lorimer burst was that its dispersion 
measure was much larger than that possible for any Milky Way 
pulsar. There is no line of sight through the interstellar medium 
with enough electrons that could explain it. Beyond the Milky 
Way’s outer reaches lies a tenuous intergalactic medium, where 
the electron density falls away precipitously to a much lower level. The dynamic Universe
105
To account for the large dispersion, the Lorimer burst must 
therefore have been very distant and very powerful. In 2015, 
Parkes detected another FRB (FRB150418) which this time was 
also picked up by the Australia Telescope Compact (ATCA) radio 
telescope. ATCA pinpointed the position sufficiently precisely to 
associate the fading afterglow with a galaxy about six billion light 
years away. The pulse was reminiscent of a short GRB which is 
now believed to be produced by the merger of two neutron stars. 
If an FRB is itself associated with a GRB, this would have implied 
that an FRB is a one-off cataclysmic event. However, the Arecibo 
telescope discovered a different type of FRB, a repeater
(FRB121102) in a dwarf galaxy 2.5 billion light years away. 
FRB121102 appears to go to sleep and wake up on a regular 
156-day cycle, and was observed again in 2020 by the Chinese 
FAST radio dish. These observations imply that the energy in a 
single pulse is huge: a one millisecond FRB contains as much 
energy as that emitted by the Sun in a century.
The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment 
(CHIME) radio telescope saw its first light in 2017. It operates at 
low frequencies and is located in a radio-quiet zone in British 
Columbia’s Rocky Mountains. CHIME is configured as a transit 
telescope consisting of four 100m-long near-half-cylindrical 
reflectors placed side by side pointing to the zenith. Over each of 
these reflectors are suspended strings of dipole aerials. Like 
LOFAR, CHIME is a radio telescope with no moving parts, and 
uses digital beam-forming technology to direct the beam to 
different parts of the sky. With its wide field of view and large 
aperture, CHIME is effective at discovering FRBs, which appear 
randomly in the sky. In its first year of operation, CHIME detected 
535 new FRBs, most of these being the single-pulse variety in 
distant galaxies. These brief and mysterious radio beacons are not 
understood and are currently an active area of research. Some 
FRBs emit polarized radiation, indicating that they come from 
regions containing strong magnetic fields. Suggestions include the 
possibility that the massive energy releases they produce are Observational Astronomy
106
associated with particle acceleration in the intense magnetic fields 
of magnetars or in compact object mergers involving black holes 
or neutron stars.
Near-Earth objects
Near Earth Objects (NEOs) include comets and asteroids as well 
as the so-called ‘killer’ objects that could potentially collide with 
the Earth. Fortunately, these objects with sizes of over 1km are 
extremely rare, yet our planet is continually being struck by much 
smaller objects the size of sand grains that burn up in the 
atmosphere in meteor showers and that bring us about 100 tonnes 
of matter every day. A potentially hazardous NEO is one larger 
than 140m that intercepts the Earth’s orbit. An observatory 
dedicated to searching for these objects is the 2008 Panoramic 
Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), 
which operates a pair of wide-field 1.8m Ritchey-Chrétien survey 
telescopes in Hawaii. Pan-STARRS has detected many new solar 
system objects as well as variable stars, and supernovae. In 2017 it 
discovered Oumuamua, an object between 100m and 1km across 
and the first interstellar object ever seen passing through the solar 
system on an unbound hyperbolic trajectory. It has been 
speculated that Oumuamua may have been ejected from an 
exoplanetary system.
On 26 September 2022, NASA deliberately crashed a spacecraft, 
the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), into a 163m-wide 
asteroid moonlet (Dimorphos) which is orbiting a larger asteroid, 
Didymos. This was an experiment to find out if the impulse from 
the collision could deflect the moonlet into a different orbit, and it 
was the first ever test of a planetary defence system that could 
potentially save us from the fate that befell the non-avian 
dinosaurs 66 million years ago, when three-quarters of Earth’s 
species became extinct. The extinction event is generally believed 
to have resulted from the impact of a 10km-wide asteroid in the 
Gulf of Mexico, known as the Chicxulub impactor. Follow-up The dynamic Universe
107
observations were made using ground and space observatories 
including both the Hubble and Webb telescopes. These showed an 
initial cloud of material ejected from DART’s impact on 
Dimorphos and has confirmed that the collision has changed the 
moonlet asteroid’s motion in space, reducing its orbital period by 
around 5 per cent.
The night sky, far from being quiescent, is punctuated by the 
movement or change in brightness of objects, sometimes across all 
wavebands. However, not all of these time-varying objects emit 
electromagnetic radiation and, in the next chapter, the theme will 
continue as we look at two new cosmic messengers.108

Multi-messenger astronomy
Neutrino astronomy
Neutrinos (or ‘little neutral ones’) are tiny, almost massless, 
elementary particles that were postulated by Pauli in 1930, named 
by Enrico Fermi in 1934, but not detected until 1956, when they 
were finally observed in a nuclear reactor by US physicists 
Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan. The long delay between 
hypothesis and observation arose because the interaction between 
neutrinos and matter is so puny that a neutrino can pass through 
a light-year thickness of lead before interacting with an atom. 
So weak is the neutrino–matter interaction in fact that we are 
blissfully unaware of the vast numbers of neutrinos that pass 
unfelt through our bodies every second, day and night. Cosmic 
neutrinos are produced in the stars, supernovae, AGN, gamma-ray 
bursts, cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, and in the Big 
Bang, and they exist over a vast range of energies and fluxes. 
Although their feeble interactions make them hard to detect, 
when they are detected it means that many will have come from 
electromagnetically inaccessible regions of the Universe, making 
them highly informative messengers.
The first ever neutrinos detected from outside the solar system 
were from the supernova SN1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 
an observation that really started high-energy neutrino Multi-messenger astronomy
109
astronomy. Bursts of neutrinos were detected several hours before 
the arrival of the first photons; arriving from the direction of 
southern skies, the neutrinos had to traverse the body of Earth 
before entering the detectors of the Kamiokande neutrino 
experiment in Japan and the Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) 
experiment in the USA, both located in the northern hemisphere. 
Each experiment saw a near-simultaneous, twelve-second-long 
burst of neutrinos. What caused the delay between the observed 
neutrino and photon signals? When the core of a massive star 
collapses a massive amount of gravitational energy is released, 
which is mostly carried away by neutrinos. These stream out from 
the collapsing core at almost the speed of light, and do not interact 
significantly with the rest of the star. The photons, on the other 
hand, interact strongly with the expanding cloud of ejecta from 
the explosion, and scatter multiple times before finally being 
released into space, thus accounting for the time delay.
Neutrinos exist in three ‘flavours’: electron, muon, and tau 
neutrinos, which interact with their respective paired elementary 
particles. A neutrino travelling through space morphs between the 
three flavours, a property known as neutrino oscillation. A neutrino 
emitted with, say, an electron flavour can, when observed later, 
be seen as a tau or a muon neutrino. An important source of 
astrophysical neutrinos is the series of fusion reactions which 
converts hydrogen into helium and powers the stars. When four 
protons come together to fuse into helium in a star, two of them 
must convert into neutrons via the nuclear beta decay process. 
This interaction also releases positrons and electron neutrinos. 
Each second, the Sun produces over 1039 neutrinos in its core 
which pass through the stellar surface in about a second, before 
flying off into space. The solar neutrino flux is so large that even 
on Earth, 150 million km away, 100 billion neutrinos zip through 
your thumbnail every second. From 1964 onwards, US 
astrophysicist John Bahcall developed the standard solar model, 
which predicts the solar neutrino flux on the basis of the 
conditions and known fusion reactions in stars. Bahcall worked Observational Astronomy
110
with US physical chemist Raymond Davis, who set up an 
experiment to search for the neutrinos, and so test the model. 
A neutrino detector requires a large amount of matter 
for neutrinos to interact with to produce a measurable 
number of interactions. A ‘large amount’ in this context is an 
apartment-sized tank of fluid, a similarly large volume of lead, 
or a 1km-sized ice cube.
Davis’s detector was a tank of 600 tonnes of dry-cleaning fluid, 
located 1.5km underground at the Homestake Mine in South 
Dakota. It needed to be there to screen out confounding 
cosmic-rays signals. Dry-cleaning fluid (tetrachloroethylene) is 
rich in chlorine atoms, which capture electron neutrinos and 
transform into radioactive isotopes of argon. Davis analysed the 
fluid every few weeks to search for argon atoms and found a few 
tens of them forming in the tank. The sensitivity of Davis’s 
chemical measurements was remarkable enough in itself, but his 
results were deeply puzzling. It indicated that the flux of solar 
neutrinos was only about a third of that expected. Were the 
measurements wrong, was the solar model wrong, or was 
something else happening?
The discrepancy, the solar neutrino problem, was not resolved for 
three decades. In the interim, many tests and ideas were put 
forward, including the notion of neutrino oscillations, proposed by 
Italian and Soviet physicist Bruno Pontecorvo. But repeated 
experiments doggedly reported the same shortfall in solar 
neutrinos—two-thirds of them were missing. The breakthrough 
occurred in 1998, when the Japanese Super-Kamiokande neutrino 
experiment, a huge underground tank containing 50,000 tonnes 
of ultra-pure water lined with photomultiplier light detectors, 
demonstrated the reality of neutrino oscillations. Although the 
predicted number of electron neutrinos are produced in the core of 
the Sun, by the time they entered Davis’s detector, which was 
sensitive only to electron neutrinos, they had morphed into a 
mixture of the three flavours. There turned out to be nothing Multi-messenger astronomy
111
wrong with Davis’s measurements or Bahcall’s solar model. The 
fault lay in our understanding of neutrinos.
Neutrinos are not only produced in stars and supernovae, but they 
are also generated when high-energy cosmic rays, such as protons, 
smash into the Earth’s atmosphere. The cascade of energetic 
particles decays into others, including GeV-energy atmospheric 
neutrinos and antineutrinos. It was these atmospheric neutrinos 
that the Super-Kamiokande detected, and which led to the 
discovery of neutrino oscillations. The interactions of such 
high-energy neutrinos in matter produce a plethora of energetic 
charged particles, moving faster than the speed of light in the 
water tank. Such particles produce bursts of blue light, a form of 
Cherenkov radiation, which is analogous to the boom of a shock 
wave from a supersonic jet aircraft. The characteristic pattern of 
light picked up by the sensors is back-tracked to infer the energy, 
position, time, and direction of an incoming neutrino.
High-energy neutrinos are produced in supernovae and the 
cosmic particle accelerators of AGN as well as tidal disruption 
events. The energy of neutrinos observed in supernova SN1987A 
was around 50 MeV. Detecting such bursts provides an early 
warning system for multi-wavelengths follow-up observations. 
There is a real-time SuperNova Early Warning System which, on 
the receipt of a neutrino burst, sends out alerts to astronomers to 
search for any corresponding electromagnetic or gravitational 
wave observations. The neutrino energies produced in AGN are, 
however, 100 billion times higher. To detect these neutrinos, in 
2010 a large-volume Cherenkov detector was built out of ice, the 
IceCube Neutrino Observatory. IceCube is a 1-cubic-km block of 
ice which, as well as being a neutrino telescope, is an integral part 
of the ice shelf near the Amundsen–Scott South Pole station in 
Antarctica, a place where the ice is so transparent that the 
Cherenkov light can travel hundreds of metres through it to the 
detectors. IceCube consists of 86 2.5-km-deep holes melted in the 
ice, down which strings of photomultiplier tubes were lowered.Observational Astronomy
112
In 2013, IceCube detected a diffuse isotropic flux of high-energy 
astrophysical neutrinos and, in 2017, made a major breakthrough 
in the field by detecting the first very high-energy (300 trillion eV) 
neutrino coming from a patch of sky in the constellation of Orion. 
The event, IceCube-170922A, had over 20 times the energy 
available in the LHC experiment, and triggered a world-wide 
alert. The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory identified the event with 
the flare of a blazar in an AGN some six billion light years away. 
The Fermi space telescope confirmed that the blazar was emitting 
gamma rays with energies up to 400 GeV at the time, and other 
telescopes observed emission across all electromagnetic 
wavebands. In 2019, IceCube detected another high-energy 
neutrino which was identified by ZTF (event AT2019dsg) as the 
fading afterglow of a tidal disruption event of a star being 
consumed by a 30-million-solar-mass supermassive black hole. 
In 2022, IceCube reported neutrino observations of a local active 
galaxy, M77, a spiral containing the radio source Cetus A, powered 
by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. Over the course of a 
decade, IceCube has detected some 80 high-energy 
(teraelectronvolt) neutrinos from the galaxy. However, no 
gamma-ray counterparts have been seen. This finding underlines 
the important role played by neutrino observations in observing 
AGN in which the associated gamma rays are blocked by the gas 
and dust lying near the nucleus.
Gravitational waves
Light and gravitational waves have one property in common—they 
both propagate at light speed. However, gravity is a weak force 
and has only one sign of charge (gravitational masses always add 
up to produce bigger gravitational effects), whereas electrical 
forces, whilst being intrinsically much stronger, can be positive or 
negative, and electrical charges almost completely cancel out in 
macroscopic pieces of matter. Light propagates as oscillations of 
the electromagnetic field through spacetime, whereas 
gravitational waves are oscillations of the fabric of spacetime itself. Multi-messenger astronomy
113
Unlike light, gravitational waves are not absorbed or scattered, 
and can pass unattenuated through clumps of matter on all scales. 
These properties make gravitational waves a valuable 
astronomical messenger that brings us information from 
electromagnetically unobservable regions of the Universe. 
Gravitational wave sources involve the movements of large 
amounts of mass and energy, such as in the conditions just 
after the Big Bang, the mergers of black holes and neutron stars, 
and the collapse of massive stellar cores in supernovae.
Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity describes the curvature of 
spacetime around massive objects. In a merging binary black hole, 
the deep pits of gravitational potential energy around each of 
them coalesce to form a spinning dumbbell structure. As the two 
black holes spiral inwards, their orbital speeds reach an 
appreciable fraction of the speed of light, and the disturbances in 
spacetime propagate outwards as gravitational waves (Figure 32) 
in a pattern resembling streams of water droplets flung out from a 
rotating garden sprinkler. Gravitational waves carry away energy 
from the system. This makes the black holes spiral inwards 
32. Gravitational waves spreading out from a pair of inspiralling 
black holes.Observational Astronomy
114
towards each other, rotate even faster, and generate even larger 
amplitude gravitational waves.
The binary pulsar
Gravitational waves were in fact first observed indirectly in 1974. 
American astronomers Russell Hulse and Joe Taylor had been 
searching for radio pulsars using the Arecibo radio telescope and 
discovered a pulsar, PSR1913+16, with an odd signal. Instead of 
regular clock-like pulsations, its pulse rate varied systematically 
over a period of 7.75 hours. This was the Doppler signature of a 
pulsar moving at high velocity in a close binary orbit with a 
massive companion. The pulse rate increases when the pulsar is 
approaching, and slows when moving away. The companion 
turned out to be another neutron star of similar mass (about 1.4 
solar masses), making this a binary neutron star. The observation 
of an extremely precise clock (the pulsar) orbiting in the strong 
gravitational field of a second neutron star provides an 
opportunity to test General Relativity. The precise pulse timings 
enabled the astronomers to measure the masses of both neutron 
stars with a precision better than 0.05 per cent. Over longer 
timescales, the orbital period was found to be gradually decreasing 
at precisely the rate that General Relativity predicts for a pair of 
neutron stars orbiting a common centre of mass and losing energy 
by gravitational wave radiation. Since the discovery of the binary 
neutron star, the orbital period has shortened by about a minute, 
and a merger is predicted in about 300 million years’ time.
Detecting gravitational waves
Gravitational waves exert tidal forces on their surroundings by 
alternately stretching and squeezing space, oscillating 
perpendicularly to the direction of the wave. Imagine a 
gravitational wave passing along the axis through a circular ring of 
test particles floating freely in space (Figrue 33(a)). In the first 
half-cycle of the wave, the tidal force squeezes the circle Multi-messenger astronomy
115
horizontally, and stretches it vertically. In the next half-cycle, the 
distortions reverse, and then the cycle repeats. Gravitational waves 
are detected by measuring the amount of geometrical distortion 
they produce. This is quantified by the strain, the fractional 
amount by which a wave alters distances. Just like the amplitude 
of an electromagnetic wave, the strain of a gravitational wave 
drops off inversely with distance (it is the power of the wave that 
falls inversely with the square of the distance).
Merging binary black holes produce tiny but measurable 
gravitational wave signals at cosmological distances. A test object 
placed near to a pair of merging 10-solar-mass black holes, for 
example, would experience a strain of about unity; that is, the 
object would be stretched and squeezed by an amount equal to its 
size. But at a distance of a billion light years, the strain drops to 
around 10-21. Such a small strain has the effect of displacing two 
test points, separated 4km apart, by about 1/200th the radius of a 
proton. One might imagine that such a tiny distance could, 
perhaps with great care, be measured by some sort of 
sophisticated ruler. However, any physical object is itself affected 
by the same stretchings and squeezings as the test points, and so

would not ‘see’ the wave. The way such small strains are detected 
is by measuring the light travel time between test points, in 
effect converting a distance measurement into a time
measurement.
Gravitational wave observatories
The tiny strains produced by gravitational waves are measured 
with a Michelson interferometer (Figure 33(b)). This works by 
splitting coherent light from a laser into two beams, sent along 
two L-shaped arms, reflected by end mirrors, and then 
recombined, resulting in patterns of interference fringes that 
depend on the path difference between the two. The 
interferometer is sensitive only to differences in the lengths 
between the two arms so that when a gravitational wave passes by 
these differences show up as changes to the interference fringe 
patterns measured at the photodetector.
The world’s first gravitational wave telescope, the Laser 
Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), started 
operating in 2015 at two different sites. With detectors of such 
extreme sensitivity, the risk of false triggers is high, and 
any valid detections must also be seen at other sites. The two 
US interferometers are at Livingston, Louisiana, and in 
Hanford, Washington, 3,000km away. Each has 4km-long arms 
and, at the end of these, masses are suspended on complex 
anti-seismic-vibration mounts carrying mirrors. A third mass in 
the centre supports a beam splitter which reflects half the laser 
beam into one arm, and transmits half into the other. The effective 
optical length is considerably larger than 4km because the laser 
beams are made to bounce back and forth hundreds of times 
using recycling mirrors. The beams are eventually returned to the 
splitter which again half transmits and half reflects the light, so 
that part of each beam’s light is combined and returned to the 
laser, and part is sent to the photodetector to form interference 
fringes. While the basic operating principle of a LIGO is relatively Multi-messenger astronomy
117
straightforward, making a practical instrument with the required 
level of sensitivity was a major challenge. Numerous practical 
measures were implemented to reduce extraneous noise, including 
operating the entire interferometer in a high vacuum to avoid 
light scattering as well as the vibrations caused by the pummelling 
of air molecules on the mirrors.
The first gravitational wave ever detected directly (GW150914) 
came as a ‘chirp’ lasting just half a second at Livingston on 
14 September 2015 (Figure 34). A near-identical signal was seen 
seven milliseconds later at the Hanford site, corresponding to the 
light travel time between the two sites. The ‘chirp’ has a distinctive 
pattern, beginning as a regular weak, low-frequency oscillation at 
about 200Hz. Gradually the period shortened and the amplitude 
increased as two black holes merged.
The precise shapes of the waveforms contain a great deal of 
information about the merger. What is this information and how 
is it decoded? In parallel with the experiments, a major theoretical 
effort was devoted to solving Einstein’s equations for binary black 
hole and neutron star mergers. This is a problem in the non-linear 
dynamics of curved spacetime (named geometrodynamics by the 
American physicist John Wheeler) and is analytically intractable. 
Fortunately, progress was made computationally, and a suite of 
numerical simulations has been generated using a supercomputer 
to produce a library of millions of signatures of combinations of 
mergers. These can then be compared with data. The best-fitting 
model to GW150914 (the thin line in Figure 34) indicates the 
merger of two black holes, weighing 29 and 36 solar masses, to 
one black hole weighing 62 solar masses. The mass deficit—three 
solar masses—was radiated away as gravitational wave energy. The 
waveforms contain information on the absolute gravitational wave 
luminosity of the merger which meant that, given the strain 
amplitudes measured by LIGO, it was possible to infer the 
gravitational wave luminosity distance of the merger. For the 
GW150914 event this was 1.3 billion light years.Observational Astronomy

When two black holes merge there are three distinct phases. The 
first is an ‘inspiral’ phase, during which energy is lost to 
gravitational radiation, and is characterized by oscillations of 
increasing frequency and amplitude as the black holes spiral 
inwards. In the second, ‘merger’, phase, the amplitudes and 
frequencies peak as the event horizons touch and begin to merge. 
In the third and final ‘ringdown’ phase, the resulting bigger black 
hole rings like a bell as the distortions on the event horizon are 
smoothed out, and the oscillations die away.
A single LIGO is virtually an all-sky detector, but one that has four 
‘blind spots’ which arise, for example, when a gravitational wave 
arrives along a line bisecting the two arms, in which case the arms 
are stretched and squeezed by equal amounts and no output is 
produced. With a two-interferometer measurement, some 
positional information about the source can be retrieved. For 
example, the GW150914 signal was localized to an area of 600 
square degrees in the Southern Hemisphere, equivalent to 3,000 
times the size of the full Moon. Adding more LIGO detectors 
improves precision, allowing source positions to be better 
triangulated. In 2017, a third interferometer, Virgo, started 
operating near Pisa in Italy. With three LIGO/Virgo detectors, the 
error box within which there is a high probability of a gravitational 
wave source in the sky shrinks to typically a few hundred square 
degrees. A fourth detector, the underground Kamioka 
Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA) in Japan, came online 
in 2021.
The present generation of ground-based LIGOs are sensitive to 
wave frequencies in the range 20–2,000Hz which corresponds to 
signals from stellar mass black hole and neutron star mergers, 
inspiralling from a separation of a few Schwarzschild radii. To 
date, around 90 black hole mergers have been detected. These 
show a wide diversity of black holes weighing from 5 to almost 
150 solar masses, considerably larger than what was known or 
expected. Future gravitational wave observations will also be made Observational Astronomy
120
from space, which offers two clear advantages. First, space offers a 
quiet, noise-free environment in which the test masses and 
mirrors of a Michelson interferometer float weightlessly in their 
individual satellites, thus avoiding Earth’s seismic activity which 
affects gravitational wave detectors at frequencies lower than 
10Hz. In space the interferometer arm lengths can be extended to 
a few million kilometres, which would mean that such an 
interferometer would be sensitive to medium-frequency signals 
(between 0.0001Hz and 1Hz). Such a telescope would be able to 
detect close-spaced white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way, track 
binary stellar-mass black holes many months before coalescence, 
detect the mergers of supermassive black holes in galaxies at 
cosmological distances, and even observe a putative gravitational 
wave background radiation emitted in the early Universe. In 2017, 
the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space 
probe settled on a design for three spacecraft orbiting at the 
Lagrangian L2 point, spaced apart by 2.5 million km, and 
arranged in an equilateral triangle. The LISA pathfinder 
experiment, launched in 2015, has successfully validated the 
technologies needed for the full LISA system.
Kilonova
A merger between two isolated black holes generates gravitational 
waves but emits little or no electromagnetic radiation. However, 
the collision of two neutron stars produces both gravitational and 
electromagnetic wave signals. In 2017, the three interferometers of 
the LIGO–Virgo collaboration observed a 30-second-long chirp 
from the first binary neutron star merger (GW170817) ever 
observed. It was localized to a region of the sky in which the Fermi 
space telescope observed a short gamma ray burst, 1.7 seconds 
later. The optical counterpart was located to a spot of light in the 
outskirts of a lens-shaped galaxy, NGC4993, 130 million light 
years away and was discovered by the 1m Henrietta Swope optical 
telescope at the Las Campanas observatory in Chile. This 
identification precipitated a spate of follow-up observations using Multi-messenger astronomy
121
many telescopes across the globe. These showed GW170817 to 
have the signature of a kilonova—a flare 1,000 times more 
luminous than a nova, or 100 million times the luminosity of the 
Sun. The fireball of a kilonova is powered by the radioactive decay 
of heavy elements produced in the merger. Within weeks, the 
afterglow became visible first in X-rays and then at radio 
wavelengths, reaching its peak brightness six months later; it was 
still visible at 1,000 days. No neutrinos were detected by the 
IceCube observatory.
The general picture is that the GW170817 event resulted from the 
inspiral and collision of two neutron stars, smashing into each 
other at around a third of the speed of light, and spewing out vast 
chunks of hot nuclear matter into space. The expanding cloud of 
nucleon-rich debris consisted of heavy nuclei which were 
immersed in an intense flux of energetic neutrons. The nuclei 
captured neutrons (via the nuclear rapid neutron-capture process, 
known as the r-process) to form unstable highly radioactive 
neutron-rich nuclei. These nuclei decayed relatively slowly to form 
heavy elements and released energy which ultimately lit up the 
fireball. The hot kilonova shell, bearing a rich cargo of some of the 
heaviest elements in the periodic table, then ploughed into the 
interstellar medium. This picture is supported by spectroscopic 
observations from the VLT which observed spectral lines of heavy 
rare earth elements (lanthanides) in the afterglow, indicating the 
presence of periodic table chemical elements from niobium to 
uranium, and supporting the theory that heavy elements are 
produced in binary neutron star collisions. Astronomers have 
estimated that the collision giving rise to GW170817 ejected 
several Earth masses of gold and platinum into space.
Towards the end of the chirping signal from GW170817, the wave 
signal became lost in the noise, which meant that any ringdown 
phase was not observed and so the final state of this event is 
unknown. With future higher sensitivity gravitational wave 
observations, astronomers hope to be able to piece together a Observational Astronomy
122
more complete picture of the nature of binary neutron star 
collisions, the role of kilonovae in enriching the chemistry of the 
interstellar medium, and the structure of neutron stars. In 
addition, with GW170817, the near-simultaneous arrival of the 
electromagnetic and gravitational waves showed their speeds to be 
the same to within one part in a quadrillion. The event also 
showed that the short gamma-ray burst was clearly associated 
with the kilonova.
The optical signals associated with GW170817 were fast 
transients, peaking in brightness within one day and starting to 
fade after two. This feature, allied with the large error boxes for 
gravitational wave signals on the sky, makes it challenging to 
locate the optical counterparts of other similar neutron star 
collisions. In 2022, a new pair of robotic telescopes, the 
Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO), started 
operating at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory in La 
Palma in the Canary Islands. GOTO is designed to scan the skies 
rapidly for any fast-evolving optical counterparts on the receipt of 
a gravitational wave trigger. Each system uses an array of eight 
0.4m, f/2.5 telescopes to achieve a large overall field of view and, 
in its search for optical transients, can cover large areas of the sky 
rapidly.
An exciting prospect for future gravitational wave observations is 
the possibility that compact object mergers could serve as what 
are known as standard sirens and be used to measure the Hubble 
constant. This was suggested by American physicist Bernard 
Schutz, and offers a completely different way of measuring the 
constant, because it relies on the self-calibrating property of a 
gravitational wave signal: the information carried by the 
gravitational wave encodes the distance of the source. For mergers 
with associated electromagnetic counterparts, such as binary 
neutron star collisions, optical telescopes can be used to measure 
the corresponding redshift. Such multi-messenger observations 
would complement each other, since gravitational wave Multi-messenger astronomy
123
observations are good for measuring distances, whereas 
electromagnetic wave observations are good for measuring 
redshifts. The attraction for cosmology is the possibility of being 
able to construct a new type of Hubble diagram, neatly 
sidestepping the present uncertainties in the distance 
measurements.124
Chapter 7
A bigger picture
The close symbiotic relationship between observational astronomy 
and astrophysics is inspiring new ideas and models, and these, 
in turn, suggest more penetrating observations. In this final 
chapter, let us consider how observations have shaped our 
knowledge of the structure of the Universe as a whole, which is 
embodied in the so-called standard model of cosmology, the 
lambda-cold-dark-matter model (see below). Its theoretical 
structure is underpinned by the huge intellectual achievement 
of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, worthy of a law of the 
Universe in its own right. The two key observational discoveries 
supporting the model are of the expansion of the Universe, and 
the CMB radiation.
Newton’s theory of gravitation successfully accounts for the 
detailed motions of all the planets in the solar system except one. 
In 1855 French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier pointed out that 
Mercury, the planet nearest to the Sun, showed an anomalous 
orbital precession which could not be explained by Newtonian 
theory. The perihelion of an orbit is its closest point to the Sun 
and, when an orbit precesses, the perihelion rotates around the 
star. Einstein’s first test of general relativity used these 
observations to account successfully for Mercury’s motion. As 
Mercury approaches its perihelion, it moves deeper into the Sun’s A bigger picture
125
gravitational potential well. Its motion in this region of more 
curved spacetime causes the perihelion to advance exactly as 
predicted by Einstein’s theory.
Bolstered by this success, in 1917 Einstein applied his equations to 
model the Universe as a whole. In this, he assumed the 
cosmological principle, namely that the Universe has no preferred 
centre and, on large enough scales, looks the same in any 
direction. The model predicts three possible geometries of the 
Universe, depending on how much matter is present. If the matter 
density is large, space curves to form a closed or spherical 
Universe in which angles of a triangle in space add up to more 
than 180°, and one in which the expansion will eventually slow 
down and be followed by contraction towards a big crunch. If the 
matter density is small, space curves into a saddle shape (open 
Universe) in which the angles of a triangle add up to less than 
180°, and the Universe will continue to expand forever, ending 
ultimately in what has been called the big freeze. Between those 
two cases is the finely balanced geometry of a flat (Euclidean) 
Universe where the angles of a triangle add up to 180°, and where 
the Universe contains just enough matter to slow the 
expansion down.
When Einstein published his model, the Universe was believed 
to be static (the discovery of its expansion was still a decade 
away). And this brought a problem—the matter in Einstein’s 
model Universe kept on moving around. The basic instability 
goes back to Newton’s conjecture of a static but delicately 
balanced Universe consisting of an infinite cubic lattice of mass 
points. The attractive gravitational force on each mass due to 
the others cancels exactly by symmetry. However, the 
equilibrium is precarious, for if any mass were to be displaced, 
even slightly, the unbalanced forces lead to a wave of collapse 
which spreads throughout the whole system. The problem is 
akin to trying to balance a pencil vertically on its point. The Observational Astronomy

slightest nudge from an errant air molecule will eventually 
cause it to topple.
Einstein discovered that his model could, however, produce a 
static Universe if he added an extra term to the field equations, 
the cosmological constant, denoted by the Greek letter, lambda. 
The lambda term has the effect of pushing back on spacetime, 
opposing the gravitational attraction between masses, and 
effectively prevented them from moving around. But, within a few 
years, Edwin Hubble’s observations showed that the Universe was 
in fact expanding, and Einstein regretted including the lambda 
term. He remarked that the cosmological constant had been his 
‘greatest blunder’.
In the 1920s, Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann and George 
Lemaître independently discovered solutions to Einstein’s field 
equations that described evolving Universes. Lemaître 
extrapolated the solutions back in time to a state of infinite 
density and temperature, which he envisaged as coming from the 
explosion of a ‘primeval atom’. This was the ‘Big Bang’, a term 
coined derisively by English astronomer Fred Hoyle. Hubble’s 
observation of the recession of the galaxies supported the Big 
Bang model, but many scientists remained sceptical because it 
implied that the laws of physics would break down at early times. 
The most prominent rival theory was the Steady-State model of 
Hermann Bondi, Thomas Gold, and Hoyle who in 1948 proposed 
that as space expanded, matter was being created continuously at 
just the rate needed to compensate for the expansion. This 
implied the Universe has always looked the same and there was no 
moment of creation. By the early 1960s, the radio observations of 
Martin Ryle and colleagues argued against the Steady-State model 
by revealing an excess density of radio galaxies at large redshifts, 
implying that the Universe had undergone strong evolution and 
therefore has not always looked the same. At that point in the 
story, however, new observational evidence turned up that 
clinched the Big Bang.A bigger picture
127
The cosmic microwave background radiation
In 1965, two American scientists at Bell Labs were experimenting 
with an old, oddly shaped microwave antenna in which a couple of 
pigeons had made a home. The scientists had no idea that what 
they were about to discover with it would shake the foundations of 
cosmology. The 15m Holmdel horn antenna, resembling a giant 
ear trumpet, had once been used to bounce signals off orbiting 
metallized balloons, a sort of early cellphone network originally 
proposed by the English science-fiction writer and futurist 
Arthur C. Clarke. The scientists wanted to repurpose it as a radio 
telescope. They tested it by first pointing it at a blank piece of sky. 
But it did not perform well—the noise level in their receiver was 
about 100 times bigger than it should have been. Painstakingly 
they eliminated sources of interference from broadcast and radar 
sources, and even drove away the nesting birds, scraping off the 
droppings coating the inside of the antenna. But it made no 
difference, the noise remained, and it seemed to be coming equally 
from everywhere in the sky. After eliminating every conceivable 
source of interference, they concluded that the noise must be 
coming from the cosmos. They had stumbled on the cosmic 
microwave background radiation and, for that discovery, the 
scientists, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, were awarded the 
1978 Nobel Prize.
Why was this pervasive radio hiss important? After Lemaître had 
published his primeval atom theory in 1927, a Russian Ukrainian 
theorist working in the US, George Gamow, and colleagues, 
started looking at what is now called the Big Bang model of the 
Universe. In 1948 they argued that such a model correctly 
predicts the primordial abundances of hydrogen and helium 
(baryons) in the early Universe. Importantly, the theory also 
predicted that the Universe should now be filled with a faint glow 
of radiation, the fossil remnant of thermal radiation from the 
primordial fireball.Observational Astronomy
128
The early high-density Universe was a searingly hot plasma of 
baryons, electrons, photons, and neutrinos. Photons scattered 
frequently from free electrons which, in turn, were strongly 
coupled to the baryons. The photons and matter formed a tightly 
coupled baryon-radiation fluid, in which the radiation was 
trapped, rendering the plasma opaque, like light trapped in a 
dense fog. As the Universe expanded it cooled, and, at a 
temperature of around 3,000K, it was energetically favourable for 
the electrons to bind to the protons to make hydrogen atoms. At 
that point the photon scattering ceased, and the fog cleared. This 
phase-change occurred when the Universe was 380,000 years old, 
marking the epoch of decoupling, the time when the light was first 
free to travel large distances across the cosmos. The boundary 
surface which separates the opaque phase from the transparent 
phase has a redshift of about 1,000 and is known as the last 
scattering surface.
The CMB radiation was emitted from the last scattering surface 
13.8 billion years ago and enters our telescopes from a spherical 
surface around us, making the CMB photons the oldest that 
can be observed. After the radiation became decoupled from 
matter, the expansion of space stretched the CMB waves from 
visible to microwave wavelengths. Therefore, when we now 
observe it, 13.8 billion years later, we see a bath of thermal 
radiation that is 1,000-fold cooler (it is now close to 3K) than its 
temperature at the last scattering surface. Since the radiation has 
had no interactions with matter since it left the last scattering 
surface, it has retained its thermal spectrum. This spectrum was 
confirmed by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite in 
1990. In fact, the spectrum has the most precise blackbody form 
that has ever been measured. Overnight, COBE’s observations 
changed cosmology from an approximate science into a high￾precision one.
The brightness of the CMB is almost constant over the sky. But it 
is not perfectly smooth, and its tiny temperature irregularities A bigger picture
129
contain information. At the level of one part in 1,000 there is a 
smoothly varying distortion called the dipole asymmetry. This 
tells us about our motion through space. The CMB photons 
coming towards us appear blueshifted and those travelling away 
from us are redshifted. At an even lower level of one part in 
100,000, there is a finely woven tapestry of temperature ripples 
printed on the sky. These ripples were first seen by COBE and 
were later mapped with higher sensitivity and resolution by 
NASA’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) in 2006 
and by ESA’s Planck spacecraft in 2015 (Figure 35). The brighter 
hot spots are regions where the radiation is more intense, and the 
cold spots are where it is less so. The difference between the peaks 
and troughs is incredibly small.
The tiny temperature fluctuations can be understood by 
considering the conditions in the hot baryon-radiation fluid prior 
to the epoch of decoupling. Here there were two competing forces: 
gravity and radiation pressure. Imagine a clump of fluid with a 
higher-than-average density. Gravity enhances the density in the 
clump by attracting more matter into it from its surroundings. But 
the photons in the clump now scatter more frequently and exert 
35. The whole-sky map of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic 
microwave background radiation measured by the Planck space 
mission. It is a window on the early Universe.Observational Astronomy
130
an increased outward pressure trying to push the clump apart. If 
the clump is larger than a critical size, gravity wins and the density 
in the clump increases. If the clump is small the radiation pressure 
provides a restoring force, pushing back on the clump and setting 
up sound wave oscillations, which propagate as longitudinal 
compressions and rarefactions in the fluid at speeds close to the 
speed of light. These primordial sound waves are called Baryon 
Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs). BAOs resemble the standing-wave 
vibrations of air in an organ pipe or a guitar string, and are 
similarly characterized by amplitudes, fundamental frequencies, 
and harmonics. The early Universe hummed like a musical 
instrument. But when radiation and matter became decoupled, 
the BAOs died out, leaving frozen-in patterns imprinted on 
the last surface of scattering, traces preserved in the fossil 
radiation.
The CMB fluctuations show us the very earliest seeds of all the 
structures of galaxies and clusters of galaxies we now see in the 
cosmos. The map contains a vast amount of information such 
as the age of the Universe, what its beginning was like, its 
composition, geometry, expansion rate, and when the first stars 
lit up. A quantitative way to compare this information with 
cosmological models is to study the power spectrum, that is, how 
much the temperature fluctuations vary and are correlated over 
different angular scales on the sky (Figure 36). An angle measure 
on the sky can be related to a linear distance on the last scattering 
surface. The spectrum therefore tells us about what types of 
acoustic waves were present at this time. The most prominent 
feature in the spectrum is the first acoustic peak, which has an 
angular size of about 1°, which indicates that the Universe has a 
flat Euclidean geometry.
Inflation
Although the Big Bang model successfully accounted for the 
origin of the light elements and the thermal Planck spectrum of A bigger picture
131
the CMB, it also had some basic inconsistencies. These included 
the flatness problem (why is the Universe observed to have a finely 
tuned flat geometry), and the horizon problem (why does the 
Universe look so homogeneous). For example, when we measure 
the temperature of the CMB in one direction in space, it is very 
close (to within one part in 10,000) to that measured in the 
opposite direction. These two regions are physically so far apart 
that if the expansion of the Universe is run backwards in time, the 
basic Big Bang model would not have allowed them to have been 
in causal contact with each other. Another way of looking at 
this is to ask what the maximum distance is that light could have 
travelled on the last scattering surface since the Big Bang, a 
distance called the particle horizon length. The angle 
corresponding to the particle horizon length in the power 
spectrum in Figure 36 is about 1.7°, which tells us that scales 
larger than that were not then in causal contact. However, this 
basic fact seems to conflict with the observed high degree of 
uniformity of the CMB across the sky, which suggests that all 
scales were in fact once in causal contact.

132
To resolve these issues, in 1980 US theorist Alan Guth proposed 
the concept of inflation. Inflation is based on the idea that the 
early Universe went through an exponentially fast growth spurt 
during the first 10-32 seconds, when it blew up from a billionth of 
the diameter of a proton to something the size a grapefruit, an 
increase of about 20 orders of magnitude. This happened so 
quickly that the inhomogeneities in the matter distribution were 
smoothed out, and the curvature of spacetime expanded away. 
Picture yourself sitting on the surface of a balloon being inflated 
rapidly to a huge diameter—the curvature of the part of the 
surface you are sitting on will very quickly look flat. We have no 
idea if inflation is true, but it has engendered the most 
successful theory that explains the observations of cosmic 
flatness and homogeneity. Various types of inflationary models 
have been proposed, and one of the central problems they 
address is the origin of fluctuations. The CMB fluctuations are 
believed to have arisen from microscopic quantum fluctuations 
which, during the period of inflation, became stretched to 
cosmic scales.
Dark matter
After Zwicky’s observations of galaxy clusters and his inference 
about the existence of dark matter, the reality of dark matter 
became more firmly established in the late 1970s when US 
astronomer Vera Rubin made detailed spectroscopic observations 
of the rotational velocities of the stars and gas clouds in the outer 
fringes of spiral galaxies, such as the Andromeda galaxy. She 
found that the galaxies were rotating too quickly for the amount of 
luminous visible matter they contain. If the dominant mass in 
galaxies resided only in the stellar population, it was argued, the 
stars should all be flung off into space. Rubin calculated that there 
must be about five times as much dark matter present as visible 
matter to bind galaxies together. The dark matter is believed to be 
distributed in diffuse halos around the visible galaxies. The view 
now is that the luminous baryonic matter in stars and galaxies in A bigger picture
133
the Universe should be regarded as an impurity in which the 
dominant gravitational mass (now estimated to be around 
85 per cent of the total) is invisible.
While there is abundant observational evidence for dark matter, 
nobody has yet identified what it is, and it remains one of the 
biggest mysteries. Dark matter has the properties of being 
electrically neutral and interacting mostly with itself or with 
normal matter through gravity. It has been conjectured that it 
could possibly be explained by a population of small, 
unobserved black holes. However, the current leading 
hypothesis is that dark matter is a new, so-far unseen, kind of 
elementary particle, a weakly interacting massive particle
(WIMP) which, apart from gravity, interacts only via the weak 
nuclear interaction. Physicists know of no particle that 
resembles this description in the Standard Model of Particle 
Physics, the best model of fundamental matter and forces we 
currently have. Despite many searches through the data coming 
from the highest energy accelerators like the LHC, no viable 
candidate subatomic particle with the required properties has 
yet been observed.
It is possible that a population of WIMPs could have formed in 
the hot dense plasma of the very early Universe, and have survived 
to the present. Estimates of the interaction of WIMPs with 
ordinary matter via the weak interaction are not zero, just very 
small, a possibility that has inspired experiments to detect them. 
One, the LUX-ZEPPELIN dark matter experiment located 1 mile 
underground at the Sanford research facility in South Dakota, 
consists of a tank of 7 tonnes of liquid xenon, surrounded by banks 
of light detectors. The idea is to search for very rare interactions 
between the hypothetical WIMPs and heavy xenon nuclei which 
could produce flashes of light and free electrons. Although no 
detections have been reported so far, the experiments have ruled 
out many combinations of dark-matter–normal-matter 
interaction strengths and WIMP masses.Observational Astronomy
134
An alternative possibility, conjectured by US theorists Steven 
Weinberg and Frank Wilczek, is that dark matter consists of 
hypothetical particles called axions. Axions have interesting 
properties: they interact weakly with themselves and with normal 
matter, have small masses, are neutral, and could have been 
formed in abundance in the Big Bang. Axions have a unique 
property of transforming to photons in the presence of a very 
strong magnetic field. Experiments like CERN’s axion solar 
telescope (CAST) are searching for solar axions that should 
convert to X-rays inside a powerful superconducting magnet. 
So far, searches for axions have drawn a blank.
Dark energy
In 1998, two groups of US astronomers set out to measure the 
Hubble constant over cosmologically large distances using Type Ia 
supernovae as standard candles. The astronomers were shocked to 
observe that the supernovae were systematically fainter (and 
therefore further away) than had been expected from the Hubble 
law. This implied that the space through which the light had 
travelled had expanded more than had been expected. The shock 
lay in the fact that the expansion of the Universe appears to be 
accelerating, which is not what is expected in a Universe filled 
with gravitationally attracting masses which will generally tend to 
slow down the expansion. The astronomers had found evidence of 
‘something new’ pushing galaxies apart. The degree of surprise 
was (and still is) akin to tossing a ball up into the air which, 
instead of returning to Earth, accelerates away and keeps 
on going.
An acceleration in the cosmic expansion rate is, however, exactly 
what Einstein’s lambda term can provide, appearing as a kind of 
negative gravity, or dark-energy-filling space. Dark energy has the 
property that its density is constant, which means that the amount 
of it increases in proportion to the volume created by the 
expansion of the Universe. At the present epoch the mass-energy A bigger picture
135
of dark energy is tiny. For example, inside the volume of the Earth 
it is equivalent to a few millionths of a gram. But, summed over 
vast intergalactic volumes of space, it dominates the mass-energy 
content of the Universe.
Dark energy presents us with an enigma. If we think about the 
most perfect of vacuums, a region of space from which all the 
particles and photons have been removed, there is still something 
present—vacuum energy. Vacuum energy is a prediction of 
quantum field theory which tells us that, at the quantum scale, 
there is an intense flurry of activity where virtual quantum 
particles continually flit in and out of existence contributing to a 
background energy density. The existence of vacuum energy has 
been confirmed in experiments on the Casimir effect. This is a 
measurable force acting on two parallel plates arising from 
vacuum quantum waves pushing them together. In macroscopic 
terms, imagine two boats lying close to each other and side by side 
in a choppy sea. The wave pressure pushing on the outsides of the 
hulls is larger than that pushing them apart, because there is not 
enough space between the hulls for the opposing long-wavelength 
waves to fit. This imbalance results in a net inward force. It is 
tempting to try to identify the cosmological lambda with the 
energy of the vacuum. However, this engenders a serious problem, 
pointed out by the Soviet theorist Yakov Zel’dovich in 1967. By 
adding up the energy of all the virtual quantum particles, he 
deduced that the energy density is over 100 orders of magnitude 
too big to explain the lambda term in the standard model of 
cosmology. This problem has been dubbed the worst discrepancy 
in all of science.
The standard model of cosmology
Looking at the bigger picture, the present status is this. We 
possess two snapshots of the Universe: A and B. Snapshot A is a 
picture of the Universe in its infancy, the CMB at an age of 
380,000 years (Figure 35). Snapshot B is the cosmic web in the Observational Astronomy
136
local Universe coming from galaxy surveys (Figure 8). Just as the 
pattern of bright lights which decorate a Christmas tree, seen on a 
dark night in the distance, lead us to infer the existence of the tree 
itself, observations of the spatial distribution of the luminous 
galaxies inform on the underlying structure of the cosmic web. 
While snapshot A shows the infant Universe to be extremely 
smooth (to one part in 10,000), snapshot B, taken almost 
14 billion years later, shows the distribution of matter to have 
become very lumpy. One of the central tasks of modern cosmology 
is to explain how state B arose from state A. Small fluctuations in 
the density of matter grow bigger over time via the mechanism of 
gravitational instability, which causes over-dense regions of the 
Universe to grow bigger by drawing in matter from adjoining 
under-dense regions.
The standard model of cosmology is a mathematical model based 
on the laws of physics including general relativity, classical 
mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, quantum 
mechanics, and atomic and nuclear physics. This complex model 
is analytically intractable but, by the 1980s, computers became 
powerful enough to simulate large-scale cosmic structure by 
observing how ensembles of test particles interact, evolve, and 
clump under gravity. Starting from initially smooth distributions 
of matter, gravitational instabilities do indeed produce large-scale 
structures; but, at first, these did not match the cosmic web. It was 
found that more realistic simulations of galaxies and clusters of 
galaxies could result if the dark matter is assumed to be cold, 
which means that it moves around at speeds much smaller than 
the speed of light. Hence the name cold dark matter (CDM). If the 
dark matter were hot, the clumps would have dissipated, and the 
observed galaxy structures could not have formed. With CDM 
included, the models began to produce the kind of structures seen 
in surveys, but they predicted the Universe to be only about seven 
billion years old, conflicting with the 10-billion-year-old stars 
observed in globular clusters.A bigger picture
137
The simulations could explain the observations better if Einstein’s 
cosmological constant, lambda, was added to the CDM model, 
producing the lambda-CDM model. This solves the modeller’s 
problems with the simulations, but resurrecting the cosmological 
constant was anathema to many astronomers because it implied 
that the geometry of the Universe must be flat and finely tuned, 
which seemed implausible. However, when the COBE CMB 
observations were announced in 1992, the lambda-CDM model 
gained support and, when the 1° peak in the CMB power spectrum 
was discovered, the case became even stronger. The observations 
of the accelerated expansion then really clinched the case for 
the model.
The key components of the lambda-CDM model are: Einstein’s 
General Theory of Relativity, the cosmological principle, and the 
laws of physics, as well as inflation and the dark matter and dark 
energy. It is the simplest model that predicts a flat Euclidean 
geometry, and one that fits the peaks in the power spectrum of the 
CMB fluctuations. (The solid line in Figure 36 is the model 
prediction which fits the Planck CMB data extremely well.) It also 
explains the observed large-scale structure in the local Universe, 
the primordial abundances of the light elements of hydrogen, 
deuterium, helium, and lithium produced in the hot Big Bang, 
and the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe. In travelling 
through 13.8 billion years of cosmic history, the paths of CMB 
photons get deflected on their way to us because of gravitational 
lensing by the intervening clumps of matter. Observations of 
gravitational lensing by the Dark Energy Survey Blanco 4m 
telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, in the 
Chilean Andes, is currently providing information on how the 
relative influence between dark matter and dark energy has 
changed over the lifetime of the Universe. Further constraints on 
the model come from galaxy surveys which show the faint 
imprints of baryonic acoustic oscillations on the large-scale 
distributions of galaxies on length scales of around 500 million Observational Astronomy
138
light years. The best fitting model tells us that the Universe is 
13.8 billion years old, has a flat geometry, and consists of 68 per 
cent dark energy and 27 per cent dark matter, with just 5 per cent 
in the familiar form of normal atoms, quarks, gluons, and leptons.
The history of the Universe is portrayed as a spacetime diagram in 
Figure 37, tracing its evolution from the Big Bang to the present, 
with a notional size scale indicated by the grid. The early quantum 
fluctuation era is followed by a brief period of inflationary growth. 
For the next 380,000 years, the cosmic fireball cooled as the 
coupled baryon-radiation fluid expanded. Then, the radiation 
decoupled from matter leaving the imprint of the CMB 
fluctuations on the last scattering surface, before spreading out 
through the Universe as the afterglow light pattern. The Universe, 
composed mainly of primordial hydrogen and helium as well as 
photons, neutrinos, and dark matter, continued its cooling and 
expansion and entered the cosmic dark ages, a time before stars 
and galaxies had formed.
Dark matter is conjectured to have clumped together in the early 
Universe, to form a network of filaments, the cosmic web. These 
filaments are the scaffolding upon which the first stars and 
galaxies formed. Primordial hydrogen gas is thought to have 
flowed into this skeletal backbone, where it aggregated in the 
intersecting nodes of the network in dense hydrogen-rich clouds 
which collapsed to form the first massive stars. These first stars 
formed when the Universe was around 400 million years old, and 
were made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. This 
composition enabled them to reach much larger masses (up to 
1,000 solar masses) than is possible from the more metal-rich 
star-forming material available in the local Universe. In the era of 
reionization, the first stars shone brightly with UV light, ionizing 
the surrounding gas, and ushering in the cosmic dawn. The 
massive stars, however, were unstable and exploded as 
supernovae, injecting the first heavy elements into the interstellar 
medium, an enrichment that would be recycled into later A bigger picture
139
generations of stars. Such massive stars have extremely short lives 
(of less than a million years) and, when they run out of fuel, they 
are likely to collapse promptly to form black holes of 1,000 solar 
masses. It is possible that these first large black holes could be the 
seeds for the billion-solar-mass black holes we know to have 
formed remarkably early in the evolution of the Universe.
For the next several billion years the expansion of the Universe 
gradually slowed as gravity drew the matter together, the stars and 
gas condensed into galaxies, and stars acquired their planetary 
systems. As more space was created by the cosmic expansion, the 
dark energy, which hitherto had played a small overall role, 
became increasingly dominant and, in the past few billion years, 
has speeded up the expansion of the Universe.
We have reached the end of this Very Short Introduction, and 
there remain many open questions. The big questions are: what is 
dark matter? what is dark energy? and what is inflation? There is 
37. Sketch of the timeline of the Universe showing the different epochs 
in its evolution, from the Big Bang (left-hand side) to the present day 
(right).Observational Astronomy
140
also another question: are we alone in the Universe? It has been 
said that whatever the answer turns out to be it will be an 
interesting one, and will forever change the way that we regard 
ourselves. In the last few decades, the long-sought-after dream of 
astronomers to discover exoplanets has been amply fulfilled; the 
observations have shown us that there are more exoplanets than 
there are stars, a discovery that has brought us a step closer to 
answering the question about life in the Universe. The next 
generation of powerful telescopes may well go further and resolve 
the question. Above all, the history of observational astronomy is 
littered with accidental discoveries. We must therefore keep our 
minds open and be prepared for surprises.Further reading

A Very Short Introduction
John Gribbin
Galaxies are the building blocks of the Universe: standing
like islands in space, each is made up of many hundreds of
millions of stars in which the chemical elements are made, around
which planets form, and where on at least one of those planets
intelligent life has emerged. In this Very Short Introduction,
renowned science writer John Gribbin describes the
extraordinary things that astronomers are learning about
galaxies, and explains how this can shed light on the origins
and structure of the Universe.
